Currently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available for 20 this virus. The viral polymerase is a promising antiviral target. However, the structure of 21 COVID-19 virus polymerase is yet unknown. Here, we describe the near-atomic 22 resolution structure of its core polymerase complex, consisting of nsp12 catalytic subunit 23 and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV 24 with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and suggests the 25 mechanism for activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies revealed reduced activity of 26 the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of COVID-27 19 virus as compared to that of SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into 28 RNA synthesis by coronavirus polymerase and indicate a well adaptation of COVID-19 29 virus towards humans with relatively lower body temperatures than the natural bat hosts. 30 31",

            "text": "In the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak of pulmonary disease 33 in China (Zhu et al., 2020) , which was later officially named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses with a broad host-spectrum (Vicenzi et al., 2004) . Currently, a total of seven human-47 the interface domain ( Figures 1B and 3D ). The two nsp8 subunits display significantly different 164 conformations with substantial refolding of the N-terminal extension helix region, which 165 mutually preclude the binding at the other molecular context ( Figure 3C ). The importance of 166 both cofactor-binding sites has been validated by previous biochemical studies on polymerase, which revealed their essential roles for stimulating the activity of nsp12 168 polymerase subunit (Subissi et al., 2014) . Given the residue substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV polymerase subunits 182 albeit the high degree overall sequence similarity, we compared the enzymatic behaviors of the 183 viral polymerases aiming to analyze their properties in terms of viral replication. Both sets of 184 core polymerase complex could well mediate primer-dependent RNA elongation reactions templated by the 3'-vRNA. Intriguingly, the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex displayed 186 a much lower efficiency (~35%) for RNA synthesis as compared to the SARS-CoV counterpart 187 ( Figure 4A ). As all three nsp subunits harbor some residue substitutions between the two 188 viruses, we further conducted cross-combination analysis to evaluate the effects of each subunit 189 on the efficiencies of RNA production. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase 190 subunit, replacement of the nsp7 cofactor subunit with that of SARS-CoV did not result in 191 obvious effect on polymerase activity, whereas the introduction of SARS-CoV nsp8 subunit 192 greatly boosted the activity to ~2.1 times of the homologous combination. Simultaneous 193 replacement of the nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors further enhanced the efficiency for RNA synthesis 194 to ~2.2 times of that for the SARS-CoV-2 homologous complex ( Figure 4B ). Consistent with 195 this observation, the combination of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7-nsp8 subunits with the SARS-CoV 196 nsp12 polymerase subunit compromised its activity as compared to the native cognate cofactors, 197 among which the nsp8 subunit exhibited a more obvious effect than that for nsp7 ( Figure 4C) . 198 These evidences suggested that the variations in nsp8 subunit rendered a significantly negative 199 impact on the polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12. The non-significant effect of nsp7 200 on polymerase activity was quite conceivable as only one residue substitution occurred between 201 the two viruses ( Figure 2B ). In addition, we also compared the polymerase activity of different 202 nsp12 subunits in the same context of nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. Combined with either cofactor sets, 203 the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase showed a lower efficiency (~50%) for RNA synthesis as 204 compared to the SARS-CoV counterpart ( Figure 4D ). This observation demonstrated that the 205 residue substitutions in nsp12 also contributed to the reduction of its polymerase activity, with 206 similar impact to the variations in the nsp8 cofactor. 207 208",

The data was automatically collected using SerialEM software 424 (http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/).

The 36 pneumonia disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by world health 37 organization (WHO). The outbreak has developed into a global pandemic affecting most 38 countries all over the world (Holshue et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). As of April 19 th , 2020, 39 more than 2,000,000 human infections have been reported worldwide, including over 160,000 40 deaths (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). The origin of this 41 virus has not been identified, but multiple origins possibly exist based on the recent 42 bioinformatics analysis of the viral isolates from different countries (Andersen et al., 2020; 43 Zhang and Holmes, 2020).

            "text": "219 We then compared the thermostability of each component in the polymerase complex of 220 the two viruses (Figure 6). Consistent with the almost identical sequences, the nsp7 of both 221 viruses displayed comparable melting behaviors in the circular dichroism (CD) profiles, 222 demonstrating similar thermostabilities of the two proteins (Figure 6A and D). In contrast, both 223 the nsp8 and nsp12 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 showed lower melting temperature (Tm) values 224 as compared to the corresponding subunits of SARS-CoV, suggesting the poorer 225 thermostability of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Figure 6B, C, E and F). 226 Taken together, the residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 polymerase subunit and 227 nsp7-nsp8 cofactors compromise the efficiency of RNA synthesis by the core polymerase 228 complex and reduce the thermostability of individual protein subunits as compared to the 229 counterparts of SARS-CoV. These changes may indicate the adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-230 2 towards the human hosts with a relatively lower body temperature than bats which are 231 potentially the natural host of a panel of zoonotic viruses, including both SARS-CoV and 232 SARS-CoV-2 (O'Shea et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020). 233 234 Discussion 235 The structural information of coronavirus polymerase interaction with cofactors suggests a 236 common theme of viral RdRp activation despite being executed by different structural 237 components. The coronavirus polymerase subunit requires multiple cofactors/subunits for 238 complete transcription and replication functions, similar to the related flaviviruses which also 239 harbor a positive-sense RNA genome (Aktepe and Mackenzie, 2018; Sevajol et al., 2014; 240 Ziebuhr, 2005). In contrast, the sNSVs utilize fewer multi-subunit protein components to 241 accomplish similar processes, which could be activated by RNA segments instead of proteins 242 (Gerlach et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020; Pflug et al., 2014). As revealed by the coronavirus core 243 polymerase structures, it lacks the essential component for unwinding the template-product 244 hybrid which is required to release the single-strand mRNA and viral genome for protein 245 expression and virion assembly. In the structure of sNSV polymerases, a lid domain is present 246 at the intersection region of template and product exit tunnels to force duplex deformation 247 before leaving the polymerase chamber (Gerlach et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2020; Reich et al., 248 2014). The nsp13 subunit has been shown with RNA helicase activity, suggesting its 249 involvement in RNA synthesis at the post-catalytic stage (Adedeji et al., 2012). Further 250 investigations are required to understand how this process takes place. 251Of note, we demonstrate the amino acid substitutions in the polymerase and cofactors of 252 SARS-CoV-2 lead to obviously reduced activity for RNA synthesis as compared to SARS-CoV 253 core polymerase complex. Indeed, these observations are based on partial components of the 254 multiple-subunit holoenzyme for coronavirus replication which also involves proofreading and 255 capping by other nsp subunits, e.g. the nsp10-nsp14 exonuclease subcomplex, nsp13 RNA 5'-256 triphosphatase, and the nsp14 and nsp16 methyltransferases(Sevajol et al., 2014; Ziebuhr,  257    2005). These steps would also render important determinants for the efficiency and accuracy258 of RNA synthesis by coronavirus replication machinery. Thus, the collective behavior of 259 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex in the context of an authentic viral replication cycle still 260 remains an open question to be further explored. On the other hand, the lower thermostability 261 of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase subunits indicate its well adaptation for humans which have a 262 relatively lower body temperature compared to bats, the potential natural host of SARS-CoV-263 2 (O'Shea et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020). Interestingly, we also found that the closely-related 264 bat coronavirus RaTG13 showed an extremely high sequence identity of core polymerase 265 subunits to SARS-CoV-2, in which the nsp7 and nsp8 cofactors are strictly identical and the 266 nsp12 catalytic subunit harbors only four residue replacements between the two viruses (Figure 267",

            "text": "S5), suggesting similar enzymatic properties and thermostabilities of their polymerase 268 components. This observation indicated the RaTG13 coronavirus has been well adapted to 269 human hosts in terms of viral replication machinery and might further support the probable bat-270 origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020). 271 In summary, our structural and biochemical analyses on SARS-CoV-2 core polymerase 272 complex improve our understanding on the mechanisms of RNA synthesis by different viral 273 RdRps and highlight a common theme for polymerase activation by stabilizing critical catalytic 274 motifs via diverse means. In addition, the different biochemical properties of polymerase 275 components of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV suggest the clues for adaptive evolution of 276 coronaviruses in favor of human hosts. 277 278 We thank all staff members in the Center of Biological Imaging (CBI), Institute of Biophysics 280 (IBP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), for assistance with data collection.
