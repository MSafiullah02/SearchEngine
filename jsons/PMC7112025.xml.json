The sDPP4 level in plasma varies depending on pathophysiological conditions such as the presence of metabolic disease or inflammation (Lambeir et al., 2003, Rohrborn et al., 2015). sDPP4 level and enzyme activity are also affected by viral infections including hepatitis C virus and Epstein-Barr virus (Andrieu et al., 2003). Since sDPP4 is capable of interfering with MERS-CoV infection by competitively interacting with the viral spike protein (Raj et al., 2013), we sought to evaluate sDPP4 levels in the body fluids of MERS patients.",

Chronic infection of hepatitis C and E viruses significantly increase sDPP4 activity and protein levels in patients\u2019 sera (Andrieu et al., 2003, Rafiei et al., 2016). sDPP4 is also elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from patients with pulmonary pathologic conditions, but these levels are regulated independent of serum levels (Juillerat-Jeanneret et al., 1997). Recently, it has been shown that DPP4 expression in pulmonary tissues of smokers and patients with chronic respiratory diseases is upregulated, which could partially explain why these individuals are more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection (Meyerholz et al., 2016, Seys et al., 2018). We observed that sDPP4 is released into respiratory secretions of MERS patients to varying degrees. Although we did not show whether the levels of sDPP4 in respiratory secretions are upregulated, we can suppose that lung inflammation induced by MERS-CoV infection may upregulate sDPP4 secretion as reported in other pulmonary diseases (Juillerat-Jeanneret et al., 1997). However, it is interesting to note that the levels of sDPP4 in the plasma of MERS patients were significantly lower than those of normal volunteers. Downregulation of circulating sDDP4 in sera has also been reported in various inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, and several cancers (Klemann et al., 2016). Even though the control and source of systemic DPP4 shedding is poorly understood, several organs including the spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and some immune cells with high DPP4 activity might be putative targets for regulating systemic sDPP4 levels in plasma (Mulvihill and Drucker, 2014). Since a large number of studies clearly demonstrate that DPP4 also plays an integral role in the immune system (Klemann et al., 2016), it would be interesting to determine how MERS-CoV infection regulates the expression and secretion of sDPP4, and the specific role of reduced sDPP4 in anti-viral immunity or viral pathogenesis. Interestingly, when we assessed various cytokines levels in the same plasma samples in a previous study (Min et al., 2016), only the levels of IL-10 and EGF are significantly negatively and positively correlated with plasma sDPP4 concentration, respectively (\nFig. 3). The functional correlation of sDPP4 with the immune-suppressive cytokine, IL-10, or protective growth factor, EGF, on mucosal epithelium and disease severity needs to be carefully assessed in a future study with a larger sample size. Nevertheless, physiological concentrations of sDPP4 are not sufficient to significantly reduce MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that exogenous sDPP4 may have therapeutic potential in MERS patients. In addition, sDPP4 levels before infection with MERS-CoV might be associated with susceptibility or disease severity since its concentrations are relatively variable among normal individuals (Fig. 1). The physiological roles of sDPP4 on MERS-CoV pathogenesis and viral life cycle also remain to be elucidated.",
