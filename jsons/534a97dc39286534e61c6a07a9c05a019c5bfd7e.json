As suggested by Nilamadhav Kar, 81 based on a study conducted after a terrorist initiated bomb blast incident in India in 1996, people 82 go through different negative mental and emotional states, including helplessness, severe stress, 83 severe mood swings and forgetfulness, emotional instability, anxiety, stress reactions, and trauma 84 (9). On the contrary, Wachinger observed such mental changes, during an emergency situation, 85 domain as a protective factor (a coping mechanism) (10) and stated that such changes included 86 willingness to control the emotional extremes, self-regulation of one's emotions, inculcating hope 87 and courage, positive attitude and acceptance of the situation, concern about oneself and family 88 members and ability of the individual to prepare oneself, which could in turn solidify the emotional 89 instability (7).

(11) There are known effective treatments for such mental disorders, but 96 unfortunately between 76% to 85% of people from low and middle-income countries receive no 97 treatment for their mental illness (12) . A study done among physicians in China (the most affected 98 country by COVID19 in early days) has shown that an estimated 25.67% of physicians had anxiety 99 symptoms, 28.13% had depressive symptoms, and 19.01% had both anxiety and depressive 100 symptoms. Poor self-reported physical health, frequent workplace violence, lengthy working hours 101 (more than 60 hours a week), frequent night shifts (twice or more per week), and lack of regular 102 physical exercise were found to be associated with anxiety and depression symptoms among 103 physicians (13). There are various other factors, for instance the displacement of the family, death 104 of a loved one, socio-economic loss, environmental loss, lack of mental preparedness for disaster, 105 lack of social support and negative coping skills, that might lead to the psychological 106 vulnerabilities of those affected (9). Several studies have evaluated the psychological status of 107 people during pre and post emergency, however there are limited studies that assess the mental 108 suffering of people during the course of epidemics. As such, there is an unmet need for greater 109 understanding of the management of anxiety and depression in any epidemic or pandemic situation 110 (14). In any pandemic, the most vulnerable communities are in developing-world cities where 111 there are huge numbers of people, with poor health systems and where millions lack access to 112 services (14). 113 .

Another study reported that social, cultural and existing gender norms tend to 293 make women relatively more vulnerable than men to mental health problems. Yet, women and 294 girls have less access to or control over assets/resources such as information, education, health and 295 wealth, which is necessary for the response to hazardous events (27). These might explain why 296 women have a higher risk of depression and anxiety than men, and this is exacerbated especially 297 due to the COVID-19 disease pandemic and the circumstances created by the lockdown in Nepal. 298 Accurate and up-to-date health information like treatment, local outbreak situation and 299 precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower 300 psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05) 301 (25). Likewise, another study reported that an individual with longer exposure to disaster-related 302 news showed more symptoms of stress than those with less news exposure (16) . This finding 303 resembled the current study where the individuals who have higher exposure to media in accessing 304 COVID-19 information have higher risk of depression, anxiety and comorbidity. Hence, emphasis 305 should be given to provide correct and appropriate information on disaster events rather than 306 describing the ravages caused by events, which could lead to an increase in unnecessary 307 anxieties/fears related to transmission, testing positive, quarantine and stigma associated with 308 COVID-19 disease, (16) . 309 .

For instance, 255 a study conducted in China after the declaration of COVID-19 emergency situation clearly relates 256 the theory of Behavioral Immune System (BIS), as most people showed negative emotions (such 257 as anxiety, depression, and indignation) and less people showed positive emotions (Oxford 258 happiness) which means more people did produce negative emotions for their self-protection 259 (20,21).

Similarly, it was found that poor housing conditions were associated with increased use of 313 antidepressants (28). In line with the findings of these studies, the present study also reported that 314 living alone was found to be associated with depression (AOR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.82-6.84) and anxiety 315 (AOR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.65-6.74) and the comorbid condition (AOR: 8.8, 95% CI: 3.85-20. 12 ) 316 compared to those who were living with their family during the lockdown period. 317Likewise, participants with a health professional background had 1.7 times, 2 times and 3.4 times 318 higher odds of having depression (95% CI: 1.04-2.90), anxiety (95% CI: 1. 16-3.69 ) and 319 depression-anxiety comorbidity (95% CI: 1.62-6.97) respectively. This finding resembled a meta-320 analysis which showed that one in three medical students have anxiety globally-a prevalence rate 321 which is substantially higher than general population(29). This might be because health 322 professionals perceive a higher level of risk associated with the COVID-19 disease, since they 323 have easy access to information compared to the general population. Besides being fully aware of 324 the risks, health professionals are known as the first responders to COVID-19 disease and thus, 325 are more at risk for transmission. 326",

It is probable that the study findings under-340 represent the responses of those in certain demographics, e.g. those who are less educated, those 341 less affluent, and elder age populations. Also, the online survey is relatively uncontrolled. The 342 sample was self-selected and therefore there might be a high chance of response bias compared 343 with a sample that had been randomly selected. Finally, this study does not rule out the association 344 among COVID-19 lockdown and outcome variables but only assesses the prevalence and 345 predicators during lockdown in Nepal. 346 Acknowledgements 347The authors would like to thank all the participants who participated in the survey.
