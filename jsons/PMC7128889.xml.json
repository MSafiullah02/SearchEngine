As a result of this formal operational thought process combined with rapid emotional and physical changes during puberty, many youth start to think that everyone is thinking about them, so as to develop an imaginary audience. This thinking can be harmful to an adolescent with a chronic illness or new-onset illness, especially liver disease. A young person may try to deny or hide their illness because they fear the imaginary audience (peers) may find out about their illness, or the adolescent may try to prove the condition does not exist.2 Because the audience is very real to the adolescent, the clinician must be sympathetic and find solutions to not only address the health care needs of the patient, but also the social needs.",

As an adolescent explores their identity they may experiment with a variety of behaviors, activities, and peer groups, including risk-taking and dangerous behaviors.3 For a patient with liver disease, some of these risk-taking behaviors may involve an increased risk because of the underlying disease. It is also during this period that patients may start presenting signs and symptoms of psychological diseases, such as anxiety and depression. Adolescents put such an emphasis on relating to and fitting in a peer group, that having a chronic liver disease and being different may cause symptoms of anxiety or depression. Therefore, it is essential for every adolescent with liver disease to have an established medical home that not only provides anticipatory guidance and health advice to the parents and patient, but also interventions as needed and an open dialogue with the adolescent.4\n",

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently one of the most common causes of aminotransferase elevation in adolescents and adults. Infectious causes of elevated ALT and AST levels must be excluded, including viral hepatitis (A, B, C, E); other viral infections (cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus); and bacteria, fungal, and parasitic infections. Metabolic causes of elevated aminotransferases in the adolescent are Wilson disease, \u03b11-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, hemochromatosis, and cystic fibrosis (CF). Immunologic causes include autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and HELLP syndrome. Medication- and toxin-induced liver injury is not uncommon in adolescence and can usually be elicited in the history and confirmed by demonstration of a pattern of injury characteristic for the suspected agent on liver biopsy. Other causes of elevated aminotransferase activity include vascular disease, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, ischemic hepatitis, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and infiltrative liver diseases, such as sarcoidosis and amyloidosis. Nonhepatic causes of abnormal aminotransferase levels include cardiac disease, thyroid disease, celiac disease, anorexia nervosa, adrenal insufficiency, myopathy, and strenuous exercise. The clinician should not overlook the possibility of alcoholic liver disease when evaluating the adolescent with elevated liver enzymes, because drinking alcohol is a risk-taking activity that many young adults partake in with peers or in isolation but do not eagerly discuss with an adult.Box 1Causes of elevated aminotransferases\n\n",

However, an isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation without a GGT elevation may be caused by bone disease or a time of increased bone growth, as in children and adolescents. Alkaline phosphatase can be fractionated to determine if it is originating from bone or liver. An elevated alkaline phosphatase is usually from the liver if there is simultaneous elevation of other measures of cholestasis. Biliary causes of alkaline phosphatase elevation include cholelithiasis, drug hepatotoxicity, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and primary biliary cirrhosis.

The work-up for elevated liver enzymes in an adolescent should be individualized based on the patient\u2019s history and physical examination. However, there are a few diseases that need to be ruled out for any adolescent with elevated liver enzymes (Table 1\n). Depending on the acuity of the illness and enzyme elevations, infectious causes must be evaluated. EBV and hepatitis A usually cause a symptomatic, acute self-limited hepatitis. However, hepatitis B and hepatitis C may be diagnosed in an asymptomatic patient, and should always be assessed. Autoimmune hepatitis, A1AT deficiency, and Wilson disease are a few diseases that need to be ruled in or out in all adolescents with elevated liver enzymes despite symptoms. NAFLD may be suspected based on the patient\u2019s growth chart and examination. The clinician should ask about any recent illnesses or exposure to people with an illness. Many viruses can cause an acute hepatitis that is self-limited and resolves without sequela. If drug-induced liver injury is high on the differential based on the patient\u2019s history, the drug in question should be discontinued immediately. Patients that have elevated GGT, alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin should also have a liver ultrasound to evaluate for any anatomic abnormalities, such as bile duct dilatation, gallstones, or a liver mass.",

Age, gender, and ethnicity are all associated with the varying prevalence of NAFLD. Fatty liver disease increases with age, and the possibility of disease progression to advance fibrosis increases in older patients. Many studies report male gender as a risk factor for NAFLD.11 Hispanic individuals also have a significantly higher prevalence of fatty liver disease compared with non-Hispanic whites.

Mild elevation of aminotransferase activity or hepatomegaly may be the only finding in patients with NAFLD. NAFLD may be suspected based on history and physical examination, but the diagnostic gold standard is still a liver biopsy. Several noninvasive methods for diagnosing NAFLD are being evaluated and may be clinically useful in the future. The only treatment of NAFLD at this time is lifestyle modification with weight loss and increased physical activity, which helps to reduce hepatic steatosis but does not reverse fibrotic changes. Loss of at least 3% to 5% of total body weight is needed to improve steatosis, but weight loss up to 10% may be required to improve necroinflammation.14, 15 A practical approach to a patient suspected of having fatty liver disease based on history and elevated aminotransferases for at least 1 month is to draw laboratory studies to rule out other diseases, such as AIH, A1AT deficiency, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, and thyroid disease. It is also important to obtain laboratory studies to evaluate for metabolic syndrome because of the high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with NAFLD. If the laboratory results do not point to a specific disease, it is reasonable to defer the liver biopsy for 6 to 12 months to allow the patient time to lose weight and possibly show improvement in the aminotransferases.16\n",

However, the clinical spectrum is broad and ranges from an asymptomatic presentation to presenting in acute liver failure. AIH is usually suspected and typed based on circulating autoantibodies to nuclei and/or smooth muscle or to liver/kidney microsomes and/or liver cytosol antigen. Patients with AIH may also have high serum globulin concentrations including a high IgG, elevated aminotransferases, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and/or bilirubin. Women are affected more frequently (gender ratio, 3.6:1), but it is seen at all ages and in all ethnic groups.17 Children with AIH may have autoimmune PSC even without inflammatory bowel disease, so it is important to evaluate for PSC in all children with AIH. GGT may be a better indicator of biliary disease in adolescents and children because alkaline phosphatase can be elevated due to bone activity in growing children. Liver biopsy is recommended to establish the diagnosis of AIH and help guide treatment. Interface hepatitis is the most common histologic sign of AIH, but there may also be plasma cell infiltration, lobular inflammation, fibrosis, and rarely granulomas.18\n",

However, all children diagnosed with AIH should be started on treatment at the time of diagnosis regardless of the severity of disease activity because children seem to present with a more severe disease process.17 Standard therapy for AIH in adolescents usually consists of prednisone with or without azathioprine. The prednisone is typically tapered to a low maintenance dose during the first few months of treatment provided there is prompt response in liver enzymes. There are many side effects related to the use of prednisone, including weight gain, higher body mass index, stunted linear growth, and pubertal delay, which are important to consider when treating adolescents with AIH. Budesonide, a topical steroid, with azathioprine is a reasonable alternative treatment with fewer side effects, including less weight gain and lower body mass index, which may be used to maintain remission in adolescents with steroid-related side effects. Azathioprine is also used as maintenance therapy alone.19 Some patients are able to completely stop therapy with close serologic monitoring and after 2 to 3 years of biochemical remission and histologic resolution.20 About 20% of children with type 1 AIH are able to permanently discontinue immunosuppressive therapy without disease recurrence, but this rarely is the case in children with type 2 AIH.21 Disease refractory to standard therapy typically progresses to cirrhosis and may necessitate liver transplant.",

Children usually present with liver disease between the ages of 9 and 13 years.26 The hepatic manifestations of Wilson disease vary greatly and consist of asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities and steatosis, acute hepatitis and acute liver failure with an associated Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Biochemical abnormalities may include elevated aminotransferases, low serum ceruloplasmin, elevated 24-hour urinary copper, Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or coagulopathy. Additional signs and symptoms associated with hepatic Wilson disease are Kayser-Fleischer rings (50% patients with hepatic disease and diagnosed on slit-lamp examination), abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, jaundice, splenomegaly, ascites, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or mental status changes caused by hepatic encephalopathy.24 Liver biopsy shows a high hepatic copper concentration.",

It is the most common known genetic cause of liver disease leading to pediatric liver transplantation. A1AT is a serum glycoprotein synthesized mainly in the liver in large quantities and secreted into the serum. Its physiologic function is to inhibit neutrophil proteases released during periods of inflammation to protect host tissue from nonspecific injury. There are many known mutations of the A1AT gene but most patients with liver disease are homozygous for the Z mutant allele (Pi*ZZ). This occurs approximately 1 in 2000 to 5000 births in North American and European populations.27 The A1AT mutant Z gene directs the synthesis of a mutant protein that is abnormally folded and retained intracellularly within the hepatocyte rather than being excreted. The accumulation of the mutant protein within hepatocytes triggers a cascade of chronic hepatocellular apoptosis, regeneration, and end-organ injury, which leads to liver injury, cirrhosis, and hepatocelllular carcinoma given the right environmental triggers.28, 29 Patients may present with neonatal hepatitis and cholestasis or as an adolescent with elevated aminotransferases, elevated GGT, and hepatomegaly.

The incidence is 1 in 100,000 live births with more than half of patients having a de novo mutation on the JAG1 or NOTCH 2 genes.37 There is variable penetrance and phenotypic expression. Patients are usually diagnosed as an infant when they are noted to have a direct hyperbilirubinemia, elevated aminotransferases, and a disproportionally elevated GGT. The common clinical features include chronic cholestasis; cardiac anomalies; butterfly vertebrae; posterior embryotoxon of the eye; and dysmorphic facies consisting of a triangular facies, deep-set eyes, and a broad nasal bridge. These patients may also have renal disease, pancreatic insufficiency, developmental delay, short stature, or intracranial hemorrhage. Vascular anomalies in multiple organs, including the central nervous system, are common. There is a 10% to 15% risk of intracranial hemorrhage with an associated 30% mortality. These bleeds respond well to surgical clip ligation.38 Treatment of Alagille syndrome involves managing the different diseases in each affected organ system.",

These disorders usually present during infancy with cholestasis, coagulopathy caused by vitamin K malabsorption, elevated aminotransferases, and a normal or nearly normal GGT in PFIC 1 and PFIC 2. PFIC is associated with growth failure and progressive liver disease. PFIC 1 is autosomal-recessive and is distinguished by missense mutations in the ATP8B1 gene. Patients with PFIC 1 usually present within the first year of life, have a low or normal GGT, and have intense pruritus. The progression to biliary cirrhosis is variable but they may respond to a biliary diversion with some improvement in pruritus and a slowing of the progression of liver disease.39\n",

Patients with PFIC 3 are noted to have a high GGT and liver biopsy shows ductal proliferation. Depending on the mutation, patients may present with clinical cholestasis in early childhood or they may present with a milder form of the disease at an older age. Pruritus is usually milder in PFIC 3, but the disease can still progress to end-stage liver disease. Treatment of patients with PFIC involves addressing nutritional deficiencies, including fat-soluble vitamin supplementation, and pruritus. Ursodeoxycholic acid might improve mild pruritis; however, severe pruritis is often refractory to medical therapy and requires surgery for biliary diversion. Biliary diversion may help the pruritis, but it might also improve biochemical abnormalities and slow the progression of liver disease. Liver transplant is a feasible option for patients with end-stage liver disease or pruritus refractory to all medical and surgical therapies.",

The clinician must juggle management of what are complex liver diseases while fully considering the patient\u2019s psychosocial health. Young people are undergoing major changes in their psychosocial and physical development while at the same time trying to gain independence during adolescence. Unfortunately, the progress in self-management skills usually lags behind psychosocial development and pediatric clinicians and parents are not always tuned in to the need to guide the adolescent\u2019s development of self-management skills. Self-management skills include adhering to the treatment regimen, taking responsibility for medications, getting required blood tests in a timely manner, scheduling and attending appointments, and recognizing signs and symptoms suggesting a change in their health status. Typically, chronologic age is frequently used as the criteria to determine the patient\u2019s readiness for a somewhat abrupt transition from child-centered health care to adult-centered health care. However, studies have shown that when responsibilities for health-related tasks are gradually shifted throughout adolescence in a developmentally appropriate manner, the adolescent gains the skills, knowledge, and experience necessary to master self-management skills and the independence required to be successful in the adult health care system.41\n",

Transition of care should begin around 10 to 12 years depending on the developmental maturity of the patient and is a multifaceted process that addresses the medical, psychosocial, and educational needs of the adolescent as they prepare to move from pediatric-centered health care to adult-centered health care.48 Before transfer of care to the adult health care system, the patient must achieve transfer readiness, which includes understanding the illness, self-management skills, and the ability to assume responsibility of his or her health care. In addition, it is helpful to identify an adult health care provider or group at least 6 to 12 months before the transfer and work closely with them during the transfer. This may include joint clinic appointments or scheduled appointments with the adult care provider to become familiar with the practice and expectations of the adult health care system while still following with the pediatric health care provider. Transition preparation is a continuous process and should incorporate interventions to promote self-management skills and adherence as pediatric patients prepare to move from child-centered care to adult-centered care to ensure a successful transfer of care.",
