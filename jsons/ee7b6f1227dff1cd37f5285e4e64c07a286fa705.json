Patient volume can take the form of prevalence (i.e., occupancy) and frequency (i.e., turnover). Increased patient acuity-such as patients who require ICU admission and invasive mechanical ventilation-can cause strain by either an increase in acuity among the same patient volume www.ccejournal.org 2020 \u2022 Volume 2 \u2022 e0110 (e.g., an influenza season with higher virulence but the same prevalence) or increased per-patient acuity paired with increased patient volume (e.g., a novel viral epidemic that leads to a new population of critically ill patients on top of the normal respiratory viral season burden). Special patient care demands include the added burdens of personal protective equipment (PPE), isolation precautions logistics, staff safety and wellbeing, and other factors, either dependent or independent of acuity, which may require a Figure 1 . A conceptual and adaptable approach to hospital preparedness for acute surge events due to emerging infectious diseases. Healthcare capacity strain occurs due to increased patient volume, increased patient acuity, special patient care demands, and/or resource reduction. Preparedness and response strategies to combat acute surge events must address the \"four Ss\": space (beds), staff (clinicians and operations), stuff (physical equipment), and system (coordination) (Surge capacity themes from Toerper et al [16] ). PPE = personal protective equipment. significant increase in per-patient resource utilization. For example, a single noncritically ill patient under investigation for Ebola virus disease is likely to use far greater resources than a much larger number of patients requiring droplet precautions during a routine respiratory viral season at the same hospital (G.L. Anesi, unpublished observations, 2020) . Finally, resource reduction can take the form of either an inability to augment resources to match increases in patient volume, acuity, or special care demands, or an absolute reduction in resources such as due to local or distant infrastructure disruption. Most strain events operate via multiple of these pathways simultaneously, in a way that is at least additive and may be synergistic: a severe respiratory virus that brings both more and sicker patients who require isolation precautions and PPE shortages; a natural disaster that brings a surge in trauma and a concomitant loss of local operational healthcare facilities.",

One extreme of the healthcare capacity spectrum is what may be called \"chronic\" or \"static\" strain, and is the situation under which care is delivered in resource-limited settings, domestically and globally, where there is a baseline, persistent mismatch in the supply and demand of care resources, on top of which acute insults may additionally be added (5) . The other extreme of the healthcare capacity spectrum is an \"acute surge event, \" in which there is a dramatic increase in care demands and/or decrease in care resources that trigger deviations from normal care delivery processes, reliance on contingencies and external resources, and, in the most extreme cases, nonroutine decisions about resource allocation.

This incident command system will continually assess the demands on resources posed by all facets of the healthcare system and with input from clinical and operations leadership, provide targeted recommendations to alter operations to conserve or free up resources for the response. The incident commander will communicate frequently with other local and regional healthcare systems, as well as state and/or national authorities to allow for real-time tracking of a pandemic, the institution of a coordinated response to maximize local or regional capacity early on in the surge, and to mobilize state or national support as the surge continues. Systems are strengthened by: situational awareness of current resources; frequent data tracking during normal operations to provide early warnings of a surge; established early triggers for activation of incident command and institution of surge plans; and preexisting lines for communication between local and regional healthcare entities for early mobilization of resources.",

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO PUI and case definitions are a starting point but are rarely as clear-cut as desired. PUI definitions frequently begin with the combination of a compatible clinical syndrome and a relevant travel history or direct contact with a suspected or known infection. This definition can change rapidly when regional epidemiology changes as an outbreak spreads, including most dramatically when community transmission-infections with no known specific sick contact-are observed locally or within a hospital. Key factors that influence protocols for diagnostic testing and case declarations include testing availability, testing turnaround time, regional epidemiology, and pathogen-specific factors such as transmissibility, virulence, and PPE requirements.",

The spectrum of healthcare capacity strain. Random variation and semi-predictable variations can exist in well-resourced settings or on top of a baseline of static strain in resource-limited settings. Acute surge events are defined by a dramatic increase in care demands and/or decrease in care resources that trigger deviations from normal care delivery processes, reliance on contingencies and external resources, and, in the most extreme cases, nonroutine decisions about resource allocation. Etiologies of acute surge events include epidemics and pandemics from emerging pathogens, natural disasters, attacks on the public, and primary infrastructure loss. the workforce. For an emerging pathogen, testing is often first available from centralized governmental public health labs such as the CDC or state departments of health. We recommend hospitals simultaneously pursue all available avenues of testing for a novel pathogen-federal, state, local, commercial, and in-houseas supply (of tests or testing components), demand, and regulatory barriers may be unpredictable. If demand for tests exceeds supply, centralized testing centers may enact restrictions, but local hospitals may have to further restrict which patients are referred for testing. This scarce resource allocation can significantly impact PPE utilization, in-facility transmission, and staff safety and anxiety. Iterative deployment of testing algorithms that are applied by frontline clinical staff is a priority.",

Factors that influence PPE practices include public health guidelines, local epidemiology, staff training and comfort, and availability. Education, dissemination, and training for PPE typically begins with infection control or safety officers, but because demand for training can easily overwhelm those individuals or departments, it is best propagated by local champions that take ownership over PPE training and adherence in their unit, and by adopting a teach-the-teacher approach so that rotating staff can feel confident they will have access to training or retraining on a rolling basis. Unit-based trained observers (i.e., doffing monitors) can be a very effective safety mechanism, particularly early in an infectious disease surge where PPE expertise is heterogeneous. Threats to a well-functioning approach to PPE include staff confusion and distrust, shortages, disagreements in public health guidelines, inconsistencies in internal training documents and policies including for handling PUI/test-pending status, and evolving epidemiology including documented nosocomial transmission.",

Most hospitals do not have available or easily emptied hospital units to dedicate to what is often one or a small number of patients early on. The alternative to cohorting is admitting patients to scattered locations throughout the hospital, for example, to the one or two AIIRs on each floor. This leads to disparate patient locations that each require PPE and clinical up-training of local staff, and increases the volume of staff and bystander patients that may be exposed. In contrast, cohorting concentrates equipment and expertise in one or more dedicated locations, preserves PPE, and removes or reduces transmission risk from other areas of the hospital. Isolation unit teams become experts at PPE, clinical management of the given pathogen, and implementing clinical operations protocols newly designed to improve care and safety. Many hospitals that have experienced an infectious acute surge event convert to cohorting and reflect they wish they had done so sooner. Although it is hard to begin cohorting when there are only a small number of patients in-house for financial and logistical reasons, it is decidedly more difficult to transition to cohorting later, when a hospital has many patients spread across multiple units among their routine patients.",

In parallel with clinical operations, create or adapt guidelines or protocols for clinical management and be prepared for iterative updates as new experience and data emerge. In all of the above, have an eye toward healthcare worker and bystander patient safety. For respiratory viruses, for example, hospital or unit leadership will be asked how to handle routine but aerosol-producing procedures such as nebulized bronchodilators, sputum and tracheal aspirate sampling, bronchoscopy, high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, intubation, and extubation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a particularly sensitive example of a procedure with high risk of exposure to a large number of staff, for which, in the context of a novel pathogen and/ or severe resource shortages, hospital leadership will undoubtedly be asked about its continued safety.

Bedside clinicians who make medical decisions must be separated from any allocation decisions to protect the patient-physician relationship and absolve the clinician of that weight. Form a committee to determine allocation of scarce resources. Use guidance from state policies and documents developed by other institutions, and tailor them to your hospital, including characteristics of the disease such as load of resource utilization per patient and expected clinical course of the disease. Involve ethicists, either those within your system or via remote consultation in the development of scarce resource policies.
