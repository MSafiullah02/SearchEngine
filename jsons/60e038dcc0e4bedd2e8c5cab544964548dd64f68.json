Genomics and genomics-derived applications have been used to study virulence, transmission, immune evasion, host-microbial interactions and microbial ecology in some of the most clinically signifi cant pathogens in the developing world. Virulence is the degree of pathogenicity of an infectious agent, indicated by case mortality (Black et al. 2010 ) rates and its ability to invade and damage host tissue. Virulence is mediated by several genetic factors which code for proteins involved in adhesion, colonization, toxin production and invasion. Whole-genome sequencing can be used in conjunction with microarray-based technologies, targeted genetic screens and proteomic analysis to discover virulence genes.",

The expansion of genomics has been fuelled by rapid advancements in DNA-sequencing technologies. Several faster, cheaper and higher throughput nucleic acid sequencing and analysis platforms have become available in the last few years and are more accessible than ever before, even in the developing countries (many are described in accompanying chapters throughout this book). Genomics tools have the advantage that they are not culture dependent and pathogen nucleic acids can be analysed long after the cells have lost viability. Hence, these tools can be invaluable in resourcelimited settings whereby the reagents and equipment to support culture are not easily accessible (e.g. media, incubators and \u221220\u221270\u00b0C freezers).",

In recent years, whole-genome analysis demonstrated the S. pneumoniae harbours several pathogenicity islands in its ~ 2-MB genome.

This suggests that host genomics could be an important determinant of the geographic distribution of Hib invasive disease. Gram-negative bacilli are present in the nasopharyngeal mucosa of more than half of Brazilian and Angolan children, in sharp contrast to 4% of Dutch children. Not surprisingly, Gram-negative bacilli are a common cause of pneumonia in Brazil and Angola as in many developing countries (Wolf et al. 1999 ; Obaro and Adegbola 2002 ) . More specifi cally, genetic background or ethnicity could be directly associated with vulnerability to pneumonia, meningitis and other invasive bacterial diseases. For instance, in an arid region of Western Australia, S. pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus infl uenzae carriage is several-fold higher among Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal children, and this is refl ected in the large disparity in the burden of pneumonia and meningitis in the two groups (Mackenzie et al. 2010 ) . Nasopharyngeal carriage of respiratory pathogens among Chinese and Vietnamese children <5 years in Hong Kong was signifi cantly different after adjusting for age, smoking and socio-economic conditions. Hence, it is plausible that host-genomics studies could reveal more interesting associations between host genetics and vulnerability to various pathogens, and this warrants more attention.",

Genomics applications can be used to track how pathogens are transmitted across individuals and identify potential reservoirs within populations. For instance, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) based on seven housekeeping genes of S. pneumoniae isolates from 158 West African villagers from 19 households showed strong evidence of non-random distribution of S. pneumoniae sequence types among households and that transmission most often occurs from children to other household members (Hill et al. 2010 ) .",

Within an environment of polymicrobial immune stimulation, persisting microbes must also contend with the host's multilayered defences which constitute a barrage of bacteriostatic proteins, bactericidal factors, secretory immunoglobulins and a mucociliary clearance system. On the other hand, microorganisms, particularly those that have co-evolved with the human host, have developed several strategies to evade the mucosal immune responses. Mucosal immune responses to two closely related obligate colonizers of the URT mucosa, Neisseria lactamica and N. meningitidis appear distinct. In contrast to its pathogenic relative, N. lactamica does not induce the development of mucosal T-and B-cells in young individuals, maintaining immunological ignorance in the host which may facilitate the longer and more frequent colonization observed for N. lactamica strains. Host and pathogen genomics studies could be applied to elucidate why N. lactamica does not prime the mucosal immune system (Vaughan et al. 2009 ) . This could be explained by fi ndings from a comparative genome hybridization study of various unrelated N. lactamica strains to a pan-Neisseria microarray which showed that ~40% of Neisseria virulence genes are absent in the N. lactamica genome (Snyder and Saunders 2006 ) .",

S. pneumoniae serotype 14 was isolated from the cerebrospinal fl uid examination (CSF) using standard laboratory culture and latex agglutination-based serotyping. The infection was treated with ceftriaxone and there was no evidence of neurological sequelae. However, within 28 days, the same infant was admitted to the Medical Research Council Unit with S. pneumoniae serotype 14 meningitis, and despite the antibiotic treatment administered, the infant suffered neurological sequelae from the second episode. Initially it appeared that this was a case of endogenous reactivation due to treatment failure during the fi rst episode of meningitis. However, MLST analysis based on seven S. pneumoniae housekeeping genes was conducted on the two serotype 14 isolates revealing that they belonged to different and unrelated sequence types (ST), i.e. ST915 common in The Gambia from the fi rst episode and a novel ST which belongs to a different clonal complex from the second episode. Hence, MLST analysis showed that this was not a relapse or recurrent infection by the same microbe, but rather an exogenous (different strain) infection (Antonio et al. 2009 ) .",

However, TB currently represents the most signifi cant re-emerging infectious disease infecting a third of the world's population and causing more than two million deaths annually. TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex including M. africanum which causes up to 50% of TB in West Africa . The re-emergence of TB is partly attributable to the increasing incidence of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. Other important factors contributing to the re-emergence of TB are poor protection of the BCG vaccine in most regions and HIV co-infection. Mycobacteria genomics research has been crucial in the understanding of the evolution, adaptation and pathogenesis among pathogens causing TB and the development of unambiguous typing tools. The Mycobacteria genome is characterized by a lack of horizontal gene exchange and the presence of large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs), SNPs and several irreversible genomic deletions which are robust phylogenetically informative markers and useful for defi ning lineages within mycobacterial clusters. LSP-and SNP-based phylogenetic studies have shown that there are distinct geographical patterns in the distribution of M. tuberculosis globally . A few lineages are found in many different regions across the globe while others are restricted to certain geographic regions (de Jong et al. 2010 ) .",

Several rapid diagnostic systems have been developed, i.e. AccuProbe developed by Gen-Probe which uses chemiluminescent probes to detect nucleic acids of specifi c pathogens; the ResPlex system developed by Qiagen which uses microarray technology and detects amplifi ed species-specifi c DNA sequences for several organisms; and the T500 biosensor (PCR/ESI-MS) which uses an MLST approach to simultaneously detect numerous pathogens, determine their clonality (relatedness) to other strains and identify resistance genotypes and virulence factors within a few hours. One of the most widely used rapid diagnosis systems is the GeneXpert system (Cepheid) which uses a realtime PCR system to identify infections in less than an hour. The GeneXpert system has been adapted for the identifi cation of several pathogens including methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Group B Streptococcus , Clostridium diffi cile and M. tuberculosis . The Xpert MTB/RIF identifi es M. tuberculosis using the rpo B gene ( b subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase) and rifampicin resistance which is a marker of MDR TB. The feasibility and effectiveness of this system were tested on sputum samples from individuals with persistent coughs (>2 weeks) at multiple centres in six developing countries, i.e. South Africa, Azerbaijan, Peru, the Philippines, India and Uganda, and M. tuberculosis could be detected in less than a day, compared to 16 and 30 days required for liquid and solid cultures, respectively. Likewise, the time to treatment for smear-negative tuberculosis was reduced from a median of 56 days to 5 days with the use of the MTB/RIF assay. Interestingly, the specifi city and sensitivity of the assay were comparable among centres and countries with different capacities, indicating that the MTB/RIF system can be used effectively in resource-limited settings (Boehme et al. 2011 ) . Genomics research in the developing world is useful in the rapid identifi cation, characterization (virulence and antibiotic resistance) and diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases which is necessary for effective management and control of epidemics.",

Genome-wide SNP and microsatellite analyses have shown that P. falciparum chronic infections are characterized by numerous genetically diverse haploid parasite genomes established through a single mosquito bite or multiple bites (superinfection). High genetic diversity within var , a gene that encodes a major surface antigen of P. falciparum , is associated with immune evasion, establishment of chronic superinfections and human-to-mosquito transmission. These infections can persist for 6 months which allows parasites to persist during seasons when vectors are scarce (Chen et al. 2011 ) .

Rapid and accurate diagnosis prevents unnecessary administration of antimalarial drugs associated with the emergence of drug resistance. Conventional malaria diagnosis in the developing world is conducted by light microscopy-based examination of thick and thin peripheral blood smears. However, this technique is technically demanding, and low-level parasitemia could be missed and mixed infections could be misdiagnosed. PCR-based parasite detection holds great promise as they can provide information about parasite species (including multiple infection), load and drug resistance fairly quickly. Before the Plasmodium genome sequence was available, the highly conserved 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene was used for the molecular detection and characterization of malaria infections using nested PCR. However, the 18S rRNA gene has few divergent copies which may be non-tandem in some species which affects the sensitivity and specifi city of this gene target. As several genomes of different Plasmodium species have been sequenced, bioinformatics mining of the Plasmodium genomes has been used to identify novel PCR targets for the detection and speciation of malaria which have shown great promise (Demas et al. 2011 ) .",

The fi rst HIV restriction factor to be identifi ed is a 32-bp deletion allele in the cytoplasmic tail of the chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5 D 32) protein which is a secondary receptor on CD4 (+) T lymphocytes for HIV-1 and effectively blocks infection in homozygous individuals. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) which has been shown to play an important role in modulating other infectious disease such as hepatitis B is another important factor in HIV infection (Vannberg et al. 2011 ) . Specifi cally, certain SNPs in HLA-B and HLA-C are associated with lower viral load setpoint and reduced CD4 + T-cell decline. Most recently, genome-wide association studies of AIDS have shown a link between a SNP in the HLA region (HCP5 rs2395029) and viral load control among LTNPs (Limou et al. 2010 ) . Other genome-wide association studies of several large cohorts have revealed at least 14 AIDS restriction genes which are involved in the regulation of viral cell entry, cytokine defences and other acquired and innate immune functions (Kaur and Mehra 2009b ; O'Brien and Nelson 2004 ) . The characterization of host factors that infl uence susceptibility to infection has been used as a platform for identifying novel antiretroviral drugs against HIV, which are much needed in the face of the frequent occurrence of resistant mutants. Recently, haematopoietic stem cells from a naturally resistant donor were transplanted in an infected patient. The patient has not required antiretroviral treatment and has maintained undetectable viral loads for 4 years which is a remarkable achievement that will impact the future of HIV control and treatment (Hutter and Thiel 2011 ) .",

Most of the 400,000-600,000 deaths which occur yearly among children are in Africa and Asia. Genomics studies have shown that human rotavirus has huge genetic diversity conferred by the accumulation of mutations and gene rearrangements, frequent reassortment of the 11 genome segments. Zoonosis (transmission from animal reservoirs) of rotavirus also may increase antigenic diversity among human strains through the above mechanisms. Molecular epidemiology studies have shown that the circulating genotypes within a particular region can change over time and genotype diversity is uneven globally. For instance, in Europe, 70% of rotavirus isolated from humans were of the P[8]G1 genotype while numerous strains were found circulating in India (Greenberg and Estes 2009 ) . Recently, whole genome sequencing of two Kenyan G2P[4] rotavirus strains showed that several genes were distantly related to other human G2P[4] strains and the prototype DS-1 strain. These divergent genes from the Kenyan strains were instead more closely related to rotavirus genes of ruminant and camelid origin. These fi ndings have signifi cant implications for the application of the two currently licensed rotavirus vaccines (Rotateq from Merck and Rotarix from GlaxoSmithKline) which have excellent protective effi cacy in high-income countries but have unequal effi cacy in developing countries (Schaetti 2009 ) .

Invasion of the colonic mucosa by Shigella results in infl ammation, ulceration and bleeding. In the pre-genomics era, non-motile Shigella which is an intracellular pathogen was regarded a distinct genus from E. coli which is an extracellular pathogen. However, phylogenetic studies based on typing of housekeeping genes, DNA hybridization and whole-genome sequencing showed that Shigella species and its various subtypes are taxonomically indistinguishable from E. coli. (Peng et al. 2009 ) . Shigella species evolved from E. coli on multiple and distinct occasions which may explain the large genome diversity, antigenic variability and complex classifi cation. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of a large virulence plasmid which encodes a type III secretion system (TTIS) and key regulatory genes associated with Shigella pathogenesis and niche (i.e. the human colonic mucosa) specifi c adaptation (Peng et al. 2006 ) . Whole genome sequencing of several Shigella subtypes has shown that these bacteria have large sequence overlap with E. coli and that there are almost 1900 backbone open reading frames (ORFs).

In Latin America, trypanosomes cause Chagas diseases which is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in that region.

Current HAT treatment regimens are highly toxic and require prolonged periods of administration and monitoring which are problematic in resourcelimited settings where the disease burden is greatest. Hence, there is a need for the identifi cation of new drug targets which could be expedited by structural and comparative genomics. Promising targets and new drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease have already been identifi ed using genomics and proteomic approaches, e.g. drugs that target the trypanosome purine salvage pathways, cruzipain (cysteine protease) and ergosterol and trypanothione biosynthesis are being investigated (McKerrow et al. 2009 ) .",

Invasive bacterial disease (IBD) such as pneumonia, meningitis and bacteraemia caused by pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx contribute to the disparity in childhood mortality between developing and developed countries. 16S rRNA gene-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) in conjunction with clone library sequencing was used to characterize the development of the nasopharyngeal microbiome among infants from a high-risk population in West Africa. This study showed that while most infants were co-colonized by multiple operational taxonomic units (OTUs) representing pathogenic species, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus infl uenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and S. aureus, a small proportion (<20%) of the infants did not or rarely harboured these OTUs. These fi ndings were confi rmed by PCR analysis. It was hypothesized that the structure and composition of the microbiome may be associated with the high rates of IBD caused by respiratory pathogens observed among infants from this population. Further studies comparing the infant nasopharyngeal microbiome in different geographic sites and among distinct populations are needed to understand the link between the microbiome and the risk of IBD.",

Hence, quite possibly, future diagnostics could employ whole genome sequencing, particularly with emerging infections and culture-negative infections for which molecular probes may not be available. Variations in genomes not represented by marker genes, oligonucleotides binding site polymorphisms and low depth of sampling may be overcome by whole genome sequencing. Sequencing of microbial genomes is a tool that provides comprehensive taxonomic and phylogenetic information not only about a pathogen but also its functional (biochemical and metabolic) properties (Petrosino et al. 2009 ) . Whole genome amplifi cation (WGA) based on ph29 polymerase-mediated multiple displacement amplifi cation has been developed to generate billion-fold amplifi cation of DNA from femtogram amounts, even from a single microbial cell (Siegl et al. 2011 ) . However, annotation of genomes has huge computational demands, and analysis of taxonomic groups without previously sequenced genomes is a major challenge. Although still under development, WGA and single-cell genomics hold great promise for investigations for rapid and detailed diagnostic testing in the developing world. Comprehensive characterization of the 'pan-genome' (microbial evolution and population structure) has signifi cant implications in the design of vaccines and treatment strategies against pathogens (Petrosino et al. 2009 ) .",

Clinical specimens can be analysed in real time using automated systems requiring very little hands-on time. Hence, effective application of genomics applications has huge potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis. Nonetheless, the systems described above are not yet widely accessible in the developing world as the technology, resources and capacity are often not available.

Comparative genomics of SARs-CoV from civets and humans during the 2002-2004 outbreaks in China showed that SARs genomes were highly conserved between viruses from the two hosts. Genomic analyses also demonstrated that high genetic diversity in several critical genes, particularly the spike gene of SARs-CoV in civets, played a key role in increased civet-to-human and human-to-human transmission of the virus. Likewise, genomics studies have demonstrated that genetic variability of haemagglutinin molecules enables the infl uenza A virus to switch receptor and host specifi city. For instance, mammalian infl uenzae A viruses preferentially bind oligosaccharides terminated with sialic acida -2,6-Gal, but avian H5N1 infl uenzae favour sialic acid-a -2,3-Gal disaccharide which are produced by human lower respiratory tract cells (Haagmans et al. 2009 ) .",

Most (60%) of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic many of which originate in the developing world.

For instance, the ability to persist in a population for relatively long periods of time may boost transmission of a pathogen from an individual to several contacts. Other ways of enhancing transmission include the capacity to cross species barriers and adapt to new hosts (e.g. migratory birds), survive in harsh environments (radiation, nutrient deprivation and high immune pressure) and adhere to a wide range of host cell types (Jones et al. 2008 ) .",
