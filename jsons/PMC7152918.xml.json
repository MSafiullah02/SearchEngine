Sooner or later World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus as novel corona virus(nCOV-19) or COVID-19. By early January 2020, about 59 suspected cases were identified in province of Wuhan. At the beginning, the disease started as a local epidemic of China, but subsequently it quickly escalated all over the world, being transmitted by international travelers. At the present, there is no any scientific evidence for where it has originated. Currently it is confirmed as a global pandemic and dozens of western countries are alarmed by this severe outbreak of corona virus.",

We can imagine the gravity of this pandemic situation by looking into these facts. In Italy, death toll from corona virus jumped over 15,000 deaths since end of February and is still ongoing, whereas the number of infected cases from USA surpass about more than half Million population. Due to easy spreading of COVID-19, most national governments including Italy announced lock down and people are not allowed to come out from their homes.

Statistics become consciously optimistic and daily number of new registered are becoming constantly stable since last week of March. However, because of both human-to-human and asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, it is important to understand virus reproduction cases after this Italy lock down. Therefore, we developed a data driven model to forecast COVID-19 outbreak daily registered cases and recovered cases, also estimated the chance of low infected patient cases for next 60 days of Italy quarantine.",
