            "text": "Arenaviruses are a group of enveloped, bi-segmented RNA-containing viruses with unique ambisense genomic organization. Nearly all of the arenaviruses members so far described cause acute or persistent infections of rodents. Specific members of the order Rodentia (Musser and Carleton, 2005) are the principal hosts of the arenaviruses for which natural host relationship has been well characterized (Childs and Peters, 1993). It is assumed that humans usually become infected with arenaviruses by inhalation of virus in aerosolized droplets of secretions or excretions from infected rodents. The family Arenaviridae is divided into Old World and New World complexes (Buchmeier et al., 2007, Gonzalez et al., 2007). Lassa and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) viruses are considered the most important of the Old World arenaviruses due to their association with severe disease in humans. The New World complex is divided into 3 major clades (A, B and C) with clade B containing all the hemorrhagic fever (HF) associated viruses (Archer and Rico-Hesse, 2002, Bowen et al., 1997, Charrel et al., 2003). Arenaviruses have often been viewed as relatively stable genetically with amino acid sequence identities of 90\u201395% among different strains of LCMV and of 44\u201363% for homologous proteins of different arenaviruses (Southern and Bishop, 1987). However, considerable variation in biological properties among LCMV strains has become apparent, with dramatic phenotypic differences among closely related LCMV isolates (reviewed in Sevilla and de la Torre, 2006, Sevilla et al., 2002). These data provide strong evidence of viral quasispecies involvement in arenavirus adaptability and pathogenesis. Here, we will review several aspects of the molecular biology of arenaviruses, phylogeny and evolution and quasispecies dynamics of arenavirus populations for a better understanding of arenavirus pathogenesis.",

The outcome of LCMV infection of its natural host, the mouse, varies dramatically depending on the strain, age, immunocompetence and genetic background of the host, as well as the route of infection, and the strain and dose of infecting virus (Oldstone, 2002, Zinkernagel, 2002).

            "text": "Arenaviruses cause chronic infections of rodents with a worldwide distribution (Buchmeier et al., 2007). Infected rodents move freely in their natural habitat and may invade human dwellings. Humans are infected through mucosal exposure to aerosols, or by direct contact of abraded skin with infectious materials. The Old World (OW) Lassa virus (LASV) and several New World (NW) arenaviruses cause HF disease in humans, posing a serious public health problem (Buchmeier et al., 2007, McCormick and Fisher-Hoch, 2002, Peters, 2002). Thus, LASV is estimated to infect several hundred thousand individuals yearly in its endemic regions of West Africa, resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases associated with significant mortality and high morbidity. Notably, increased traveling to and from endemic regions has led to the importation of LF into non-endemic metropolitan areas around the globe (Freedman and Woodall, 1999, Holmes et al., 1990, Isaacson, 2001, Macher and Wolfe, 2006). Likewise, the NW arenavirus Junin virus (JUNV) causes Argentine HF, a severe illness with hemorrhagic and neurological manifestations and a case fatality of 15\u201330% (Harrison et al., 1999, Peters, 2002, Weissenbacher et al., 1987), whereas the NW Machupo (MACV) and Guaranito (GTOV) arenaviruses emerged as causative agents of HF in Bolivia and Venezuela, respectively (Peters, 2002). These concerns are aggravated by the lack of licensed vaccines, and current anti-arenavirus therapies being limited to the use of the nucleoside analogue ribavirin (Rbv), which is only partially effective and associated with significant side effects.",

Moreover, we can now rescue infectious LCMV entirely from cloned cDNAs (Flatz et al., 2006, Sanchez and de la Torre, 2006), which allows us to examine the phenotypes of rLCMV with predetermined mutations in the context of the virus natural infection of the mouse. This development provides us with unique opportunities to investigate arenavirus\u2013host interactions that influence a variable infection outcome, ranging from virus control and clearance by the host defenses to severe acute disease and long-term chronic infection associated with subclinical disease. Likewise, these advances in arenavirus genetics have opened new approaches for the development of screening strategies to identify and evaluate novel anti-arenaviral drugs targeting specific steps of the virus life cycle.",

The same year, Traub (1934) isolated LCMV from apparently healthy mice, demonstrating the ability of LCMV to persistently infect its host. Subsequently, Rivers and Scott (1935) demonstrated that LCMV was a human pathogen. The next arenavirus discovered was Junin virus during a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Argentina (Parodi et al., 1958). In the 1960s, Tacaribe (Downs et al., 1963), Machupo (Johnson et al., 1965) and Amapari (Pinheiro et al., 1966) viruses were identified.

Currently, there are 22 recognized species into the Arenavirus genus, the unique member of the Arenaviridae family, and 2 tentative species: Pampa virus (Lozano et al., 1997) and Rio Cacarana virus. Moreover, 2 new viruses were recently isolated from transplanted patients in Australia, Dandenong virus (Palacios et al., 2008), and from a human case of hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia, Chapare virus (Delgado et al., 2008). There are several evidences that Dandenong virus might be a strain of LCMV based on region of origin, clinical spectrum and genetic data. Field studies allowed the discovery of five arenaviruses: Kodoko virus in Guinea (Lecompte et al., 2007), Morogoro virus in Tanzania (Charrel et al., 2008), Pinhal virus in Brazil (Charrel et al., 2008) and Catarina and Skinner Tank viruses from United States of America (Cajimat et al., 2008, Cajimat et al., 2007). World Health Organization also reported a potential new arenavirus isolate from 4 lethal cases of hemorrhagic fever in Zambia/South Africa. Arenaviruses are organized in two distinct groups: (1) the New World (LCMV and LASV) and the New World on one hand LCMV and LASV, and (2) on the other hand, viruses from the Tacaribe complex, including all the other known arenaviruses.",

            "text": "The originally established species demarcation criteria (described online on the ICTV website) are: (1) association with a specific host species or group of species, (2) presence in a defined geographical area, (3) etiological agent (or not) of disease in humans, (4) significant differences in antigenic cross-reactivity, including lack of cross-neutralization activity where applicable, and (5) significant sequence difference from other species in the genus. Since the definition of a virus species is polythetic (Van Regenmortel, 1989), a new isolate will be placed into an existing species if it shares with its members 4 or 5 common characters, whereas a tentative species will be proposed if it presents at least two differences with any other arenavirus. The analysis of the information used to make a taxonomic decision could pose significant difficulties. Some isolates may have been isolated only from human patients, precluding the identification of the virus host like for Sabia virus and, more recently, Chapare and Dandenong viruses. Moreover, the antigenic cross-reactivity of a new isolate can be difficult to determine, since it requires the proper containment facility and the ability to manipulate different arenaviruses for comparative purposes. These difficulties have led more recently to favor genetic criteria to define arenavirus species. The genetic criterium relies on a statistical sequence difference between the new isolate and other members of an existing arenavirus species. This was not exempt of some controversies: (1) lack of agreement on which portion of the arenavirus genome should be used and (2) degree of genetic diversity required to consider that two viruses belong to different species. (Bowen et al., 2000) proposed to use as a cutoff value an uncorrected amino acid p distance of 12% in the NP. The rationale for this was: (1) it was the highest intra-species difference reported, and (2) the lowest inter-species distance was of 13% between Junin and Machupo viruses. However, when this criterium, originally designed for full-length NP sequences, was also extended to partial NP sequences it raised significant problems. Thus, several LASV isolates showed differences up to 14.8% in uncorrected amino acid p distances using a small region of the NP gene (Bowen et al., 2000). Likewise, Pirital and Whitewater Arroyo virus isolates presented intra-species distances up to 16 and 15.1%, respectively, using partial NP sequences (Fulhorst et al., 2001, Weaver et al., 2000). Even the recent availability of complete arenavirus genomes has not solved the problem of how to correctly assign a cutoff value for species demarcation partly because the sequence availability is biased: there are many less Old World arenaviruses than New World arenaviruses (5 versus 17, respectively), but the first ones include the majority of complete intra-species sequences (Charrel et al., 2008). So the intra-species diversity is likely underestimated among the New World arenaviruses whereas the inter-species diversity could be also underestimated for Old World arenaviruses. Indeed, when a large number of isolates were compared using the same genomic area, the maximum diversity found in an Old World arenavirus (LASV) was similar to the one found in two New World arenaviruses (Whitewater Arroyo and Pirital viruses) (Bowen et al., 2000, Fulhorst et al., 2001, Weaver et al., 2000). These findings suggest that the best way to use the genetic criterion is to follow the arenavirus species definition and to compare a new isolate with the larger available set of sequences.",

Based on NP data, WWAV was placed into the clade A, whereas GPC data placed this virus within clade B (Charrel et al., 2001). Bootscanning analysis indicated that the phylogenetic position of WWAV shifted from clade B to clade A at the very end of the GPC gene. WWAV shared more domains (identical sequences of four or more amino acid residues) with clade A viruses than with clade B viruses in the NP sequence, but the opposite using the GPC gene, including a gap of 17 aa unique to WWAV and clade B viruses. This peculiarity of WWAV was soon extended to Tamiami and Bear Canyon viruses, two other North America arenaviruses (Archer and Rico-Hesse, 2002, Charrel et al., 2002). The two North America arenaviruses recently isolated, Catarina virus and Skinner Tank virus, cluster into the North America clade and show the same phylogenetic incongruence using the GPC or NP sequences (Cajimat et al., 2007, Cajimat et al., 2008, Charrel et al., 2008). Based on their peculiar phylogenetic features, the North America arenaviruses were referred as the A/Rec lineage (Charrel et al., 2003), which could be considered as a fourth lineage exists among New World arenaviruses. Phylogentic studies based on partial polymerase (L gene) sequences showed no differences compared with results obtained for the NP gene (Charrel et al., 2003). This finding suggested that highly unlikely an exchange of an entire segment (reassortment) did occur in the past for any currently known arenavirus species. This finding was first demonstrated for Old World arenaviruses (Emonet et al., 2006) and subsequently extended to the New World arenaviruses (Cajimat et al., 2007, Charrel et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The arenavirus family is composed of two groups: New World and the Old World arenaviruses, which are considered to be two clades sharing a common ancestor. This hypothesis, however, is difficult to confirm as both groups appear to be monophyletic, and consequently the out-group used to root the tree, required to confirm the monophyletic nature of the OW and NW groups, must be from another virus family, which raises the problem of selecting the appropriate viral family, genus, and specific gene as the out-group. Using the sequence of an isolate of the tospovirus Impatiens necrotic spot virus as an outgroup (Albarino et al., 1998) found that the Old World group was monophyletic, whereas the New World group was either monophyletic using the NP gene, or polyphyletic using the GPC gene. Using the secondary structure-assisted alignment of polymerase sequences, Vieth et al. (2004) reported that both the New World and the Old World arenavirus groups were monophyletic with respect to a large set of ssRNA negative-strand viruses. The Old World group is composed of five species, and of the newly discovered Kodoko, Morogoro and Dandenong viruses (Charrel et al., 2008, Lecompte et al., 2007, Palacios et al., 2008). If Kodoko virus is finally recognized as a distinct species, then the Old World arenaviruses would be split into two lineages: (1) a group composed of arenaviruses infecting Praomys rodents: LASV, MOBV, IPPYV, MOPV and Morogoro virus and (2) a second group composed of LCMV and Kodoko virus, infecting Mus rodents. The New World group is actually composed of four lineages: clades A, B, C and A/Rec. The clade A is composed of five viruses, FLEV, PARV, PICV, PIRV and ALLV. The internal relationships among those viruses are not established, since they vary from one gene to the other and the internal nodes are poorly supported by boostrap analyses (Charrel et al., 2008). Clade B contains seven arenavirus species plus Chapare virus, and this clade appears to form three different lineages: (1) Chapare virus and SABV, (2) CPXV, GTOV and AMAV, and (3) JUNV, MACV and TCRV. Those three groups are well supported and were previously reported (Archer and Rico-Hesse, 2002, Bowen et al., 1996, Bowen et al., 1997, Cajimat et al., 2007, Charrel et al., 2002, Charrel et al., 2003). The clade C is only composed of two arenaviruses, OLVV and LATV, and a potential third member, Pinhal virus, for which little information is available (Charrel et al., 2008). The fourth clade is the A/Rec clade, composed by all North America arenaviruses: WWAV, TAMV, BCNV and the newly discovered Skinner Tank and Catarina viruses. The intra-clade A/Rec relationships are poorly resolved, due to the incongruence of phylogenetic data from one gene to the other and also due to the fact that only the GPC and NP sequences are available for Catarina and Skinner Tank viruses.",

            "text": "The hypothesis of a recombination event has been proposed as the cause of the discrepancy between NP- and GPC-based phylogenetic trees (Charrel et al., 2001). Moreover, this recombination event was supposed to be at the origin of the A/Rec lineage (Archer and Rico-Hesse, 2002, Charrel et al., 2002, Charrel et al., 2003). Several findings appeared to support this hypothesis: (1) the number of amino acid domains shared between WWAV and arenaviruses from clades A and B, (2) the 17 amino acid gap common to WWAV and clade B viruses, (3) the bootscanning analysis (Charrel et al., 2001), and (4) the phylogenetic shift seen between GPC- and NP-based phylogenetic trees for all North America arenaviruses (Charrel et al., 2002, Charrel et al., 2003), a feature also reported for the two newly discovered North America arenaviruses, Catarina and Skinner Tank viruses (Cajimat et al., 2008, Charrel et al., 2008). The consistency of that character among close viruses clearly supports a heritable trait, and thereby the idea that a past recombination event was at the origin of that lineage. However, an alternative explanation could be provided based on the peculiarity of the GP1 region within the GPC gene. GP1 is highly variable in clades B and A/Rec, whereas it is much more conserved among clades A and C (Table 1\n). Due to this high variability in clades B and A/rec (the GP1 of TRCV and SABV, both from clade B, share only 19% of common amino acids), the alignment of GP1 is not significant in term of phylogenetic information when the whole arenavirus family is compared and could represent a confounding factor for the phylogenetic analyses based on the GPC gene. Nevertheless, when only the conserved regions of GPC are used (the signal peptide and the GP2 region), the inconsistency of relationships between North America arenaviruses and clades A and B arenaviruses is still present, which strengthens the recombination hypothesis (Charrel et al., 2008).",

The possibility to co-infect cultured cells has been demonstrated (Lukashevich, 1992, Lukashevich et al., 1991, Lukashevich et al., 2005, Riviere et al., 1985, Riviere and Oldstone, 1986), but a co-infection event may be significantly more difficult to occur in nature. For this to happen two different arenaviruses must have the opportunity to co-infect the same rodent. From a geographic point of view, some arenaviruses share a common geographic localization, like Guanarito and Pirital viruses in Venezuela (Fulhorst et al., 1999, Fulhorst et al., 2008, Weaver et al., 2000), Junin and Oliveros viruses in Argentina (Mills et al., 1996), Machupo, Latino and Chapare viruses in Bolivia (Delgado et al., 2008, Johnson et al., 1965, Murphy et al., 1969). From a host point of view, different arenaviruses can some times infect the same rodent species, like Guanarito and Pirital viruses, which were isolated both in cotton rats Sigmodon alstoni and in cane mice Zygodontomys brevicauda (Weaver et al., 2000). However, despite an extensive genetic characterization, the existence of a GTOV-PIRV recombinant virus has never been demonstrated (Cajimat and Fulhorst, 2004, Fulhorst et al., 2008). The absence of a GTOV/PIRV recombinant, despite the fact that all the required factors might be present, could be explained by superinfection exclusion, a well-known phenomenon among arenaviruses (Damonte et al., 1983, Ellenberg et al., 2004, Ellenberg et al., 2007). Cells infected with a given arenavirus become highly resistant to superinfection by another genetically closely related arenavirus via mechanisms that remain poorly understood.",

Some possibilities to consider are: (1) the two parental arenaviruses were in North America, but disappeared, either by natural extinction or by being outcompeted by the recombinant arenavirus, (2) the recombination occurred in South America, and the recombinant arenavirus migrated up to North America, maybe following its host, and finally (3) the recombination occurred in North America, and all the clades A and B arenaviruses migrated south. Based on the actual and limited knowledge of past and actual arenavirus geographic repartition and host association, it is difficult to state about any of those hypotheses. Among these possibilities, the second one appears to be highly unlikely because South America arenaviruses are supposed to descend from an ancestral arenavirus located in North America (Cajimat et al., 2007). Moreover, North America arenaviruses are primarily associated with rodents from Neotominae subfamily, which are almost exclusively found in North America, and this association was supposed to be a long-term co-evolutionary relationship (Cajimat et al., 2007).",

The only finding still supporting this hypothesis is the incongruence between GPC- and NP-based phylogenetic reconstructions. The other originally cited genetic arguments are no longer in favor of this hypothesis. The 17 amino acid gap is located within GP1, whose phylogenetic information is very doubtful due to a poor alignment, and the North America arenaviruses share now the same number (N\n = 3) of specific conserved domains of 4 or more amino acids with either the clade A or the clade B arenaviruses. Moreover, the superinfection exclusion phenomenon and the absence of any lab-created or characterized PIRV/GTOV recombinant weaken the recombination hypothesis. Finally, the clade C arenaviruses also demonstrated a shift between GPC- and NP-based trees (Charrel et al., 2008), and it seems very doubtful such a rare event would be the origin of two different lineages. It seems more plausible that the phylogenetic information derived from arenavirus GPC is influenced by specific selection pressures (Cajimat et al., 2007). The reasons why GPC would be under a selection pressure different from the other arenavirus genes need to be determined. Likewise, the statistical significance of the recombination event found in North America and clade C arenaviruses using recombination detection softwares should be validated using an up-to-date arenavirus genetic database.",

            "text": "Due to the bi-segmented nature of their genome, arenaviruses have the potential for reassortment of their segments during co-infection of the same cell. The generation of reassortant viruses between two parental arenaviruses has been well documented in cultured cells (Lukashevich et al., 1991, Lukashevich et al., 2005, Riviere et al., 1985, Riviere and Oldstone, 1986). The reassortment approach has been used to define the function of viral gene products in arenavirus pathogenesis (Riviere et al., 1985, Riviere and Oldstone, 1986), arenavirus induced immunosuppression (Matloubian et al., 1990, Matloubian et al., 1993), and to create live-attenuated vaccines (Lukashevich et al., 2005). The generation of reassortant arenaviruses is subjected to the same constrains as those described for the generation of recombinant arenaviruses. Moreover, currently we have only very limited knowledge about the mechanisms governing packaging of arenavirus genomes, which may pose additional difficulties for the generation of certain reassortant arenaviruses. In addition, to be successful reassortant, arenaviruses need to have a higher or comparable fitness than both of its parents to be maintained and spread. The existing genetic data do not support a role of reassortment in the formation of new arenavirus species (Cajimat and Fulhorst, 2004, Charrel et al., 2003, Charrel et al., 2008, Emonet et al., 2006). Nonetheless, the finding by (Weaver et al., 2000) of a rodent infected by two different genotypes of PIRV indicates that the superinfection exclusion is not absolute and therefore reassortment events may occur often among members of quasispecies replicating in a persistently infected host. However, it has not been determined whether the two genotypes of PIRV isolated from the same rodent were replicating within the same cells, a requirement for the generation of reassortant viruses.",

This feature was also reported for other groups of viruses, including hantaviruses which are very similar to arenaviruses both from an ecological and overall genomic organization point of view (Jackson and Charleston, 2004, Ramsden et al., 2008, Ramsden et al., 2009). The co-evolution hypothesis requires that both the primary host\u2013virus phylogenies match, exceptions apart like host-switch events. The inherent problem of such a process is the accumulation of hypotheses: the two phylogenetic hypotheses (host and virus phylogenetic trees) are compared and since a perfect match usually does not occur, further hypotheses are proposed to explain the present virus/reservoir association. Therefore, it can be challenging to discuss the final result, since arbitrary choices must be make, like the phylogenetic trees that will be used in the comparison, as well as assumptions in the method used to reconcile the virus and host phylogenies. For arenaviruses, and as explained above, a major caveat is the lack of phylogeny conclusiveness for some clades, like North America arenaviruses or clade A arenaviruses, for which the information is not robust and depends on the gene or the phylogenetic algorithm used to infer it.",

This analysis resulted in 10 different scenarios, but authors focused on the 2 scenarios, which presented the lowest number of extra-hypotheses. Based on those data, authors claimed that the co-evolutionary pathway is an acceptable explanation for the present day Old World arenaviruses/Murinae associations. The second study was based on a phylogenetic reconciliation analysis which first built all the potentially optimal solutions able to reconcile any incongruence between host/parasite phylogenies and then tested the statistical significance of such solutions (Jackson and Charleston, 2004). The New World arenaviruses and their sigmodontine hosts were used, and the result showed an absence of statistical significance in the impact of co-evolution onto the present day virus/host association.",

            "text": "Viral quasispecies contain multitudes of variants that can manifest alternative phenotypes in response to environmental demands. The contribution of a quasispecies genetic structure to the biology of RNA viruses is illustrated by the rapid selection of variants present within replicating viral populations in vivo in response to specific selection pressures. LCMV is an excellent experimental model for studying several aspects of viral pathogenesis and their connection with virus variation. The virus in vivo in its natural host, the mouse, is non-cytolytic, and can cause either acute or persistent infections. When immunocompetent adult mice are injected with LCMV, they generate a robust immune response that results in virus clearance, which is mainly mediated by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I restricted CD8+ antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (Byrne and Oldstone, 1984, Fung-Leung et al., 1991). By contrast, mice infected neonatally or in uterus with LCMV become persistently infected for life. This persistent infection is due to the infection of thymic cells and the specific removal (negative selection) of lymphocytes with potential responsiveness to LCMV (King et al., 1992, Pircher et al., 1989). In the course of such persistent infections, distinct viral variants can be isolated from the brain and lymphoid tissue (Ahmed et al., 1984). These viral variants have different biological properties that correlate with the type of tissue from which they are isolated. One type of variant predominates in the CNS (Evans et al., 1994, Tishon et al., 1993), whereas the other type predominates in lymphocytes and macrophages of the immune system (Ahmed et al., 1984, Borrow and Oldstone, 1992, Parekh and Buchmeier, 1986, Tishon et al., 1993). Most of the CNS isolates are similar to the parental Armstrong (Arm) strain used to infect the mice and induce potent virus-specific CTL responses in adult mice, in which the infection is cleared within 2 weeks. In contrast, the majority of the isolates derived from the lymphoid tissue (the prototypic virus is called Cl13) cause chronic infections in adult mice associated with a restricted CTL response to LCMV and other viruses, as well as limited antibody responses to foreign antigens (Ahmed and Oldstone, 1988).",

During long-term persistence in carrier mice with continuous virus replication, and given the high mutation rate of RNA viruses LCMV variants that have a growth advantage in certain cell types are likely to be selected. The selection of a large number of LCMV variants in vivo has been documented (Sevilla et al., 2000). Sequence analysis of these variants showed consistently an amino acid substitution (F260L or F260I) in GP1 of the immunosuppressive viruses, which correlates with a 200\u2013500-fold enhanced binding to \u03b1-DG and a high dependence on \u03b1-DG for the infection of cells by the Cl13-like viruses (Kunz et al., 2001, Kunz et al., 2003). The analysis of the anatomic distribution of immunosuppressive variants in the spleen of adult immunocompetent mice 3 days after infection showed a different tropism for both group of variants (Borrow et al., 1995, Sevilla et al., 2000, Smelt et al., 2001), in which Cl13-like viruses localized exclusively in cells of the marginal zone and white pulp of spleen, whereas Arm-like viruses localized primarily in cells within the red pulp. This distinct distribution in spleen indicated that the immunosuppressive and the non-immunosuppressive viruses infected different subsets of cells. The identification of cells in the spleen infected by LCMV revealed two subsets mainly infected by immunosuppressive viruses, CD11c- and DEC-205 positive dendritic cells that are the major cells population expressing \u03b1-DG in spleen (Sevilla et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Another evidence of the contribution of LCMV variants to pathogenesis can be found in the neonatal infection of C3H/St mice with LCMV that leads to a persistent infection associated with a growth hormone (GH) deficiency syndrome (GHDS) (Oldstone et al., 1982). This disorder is manifested as marked growth retardation and the development of hypoglycemia, which frequently leads to the death of infected animals (Oldstone et al., 1982, Oldstone et al., 1984). By using reassortants between a LCMV strain that causes GH disease (Arm) and one that does not (WE), the viral genes causing GH disease were mapped to the S RNA (Riviere et al., 1985). Variants with the ability to cause marked growth retardation and rapid death, the hallmarks of GHDS, were present at a proportion of approximately 1 in 20 (5%) within the GHDS-nil WE population. Moreover, WE clones that did not cause GHDS, like the prototypic WEc54, replicated poorly in the GH-producing cells in the pituitaries of infected mice. By contrast, a high viral load was detected in pituitary glands isolated from mice infected with WE clones that caused GHDS, like the prototypic WEc2.5 (Buesa-Gomez et al., 1996). Several experiments have shown that variants like WEc2.2 were preferentially selected in the livers of C3H/St mice infected with the WE parental population, meaning that viral replication in the liver may favor a preferential accumulation of variants like WEc2.2 (Buesa-Gomez et al., 1996). However, this selection did not lead to GHDS, a finding consistent with the requirement of virus replication in GH-producing cells of the anterior pituitary for the development of GHDS (Oldstone et al., 1982, Oldstone et al., 1984). The basis of the differences between WEc5.4 and WEc2.2 has been mapped to one amino acid change from S (153) to F in the viral GP-1 (Teng et al., 1996). Taken together all these findings one may see an illustration of how differences in the sequence distribution between two quasispecies with very similar, or identical, consensus sequences can significantly influence the virus impact on the infected host (Table 2\n).",

Mutation frequencies within mutant spectra of LCMV replicated in BHK-21 cells were in the range of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 substitutions per nucleotide (Grande-Perez et al., 2002). These values of population heterogeneity are comparable to those quantitated for other RNA viruses (Domingo, 2007).",

The results suggested that defective, replication-competent genomes, that were termed defectors, contributed to LCMV extinction. In silico simulations of LCMV replication in the absence or presence of such defector genomes, together with additional experiments, strongly support the participation of defector genomes in LCMV extinction associated with enhanced mutagenesis (Mart\u00edn et al., 2005, manuscript in preparation). These observations led to the proposal of the lethal defection model of virus extinction (Grande-Perez et al., 2005a). This model has modified current views of the transition of viruses to error catastrophe in a substantial manner, as follows. At low mutagenesis intensities the viral population is enriched with defective genomes that contribute to the replicative collapse of the system. At high mutagenic activity the number of lethal mutations increases and extinction results from the combined action of highly defective genomes and replication-incompetent genomes containing lethal mutations.",

First, preextinction FMDV populations interfere with replication of standard, infectious FMDV RNA upon co-electroporation into cultured cells (Gonzalez-Lopez et al., 2004). Second, specific capsid and polymerase mutants of FMDV can exert complementation (at early times of infection) and then interference (at late times of infection) when co-electroporated into cells with standard, infections FMDV RNA (Perales et al., 2007). Evidence of effect of specific mutants on viral replication has been also described for poliovirus (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005). Nevertheless, it should be noted that it is not possible to predict, particularly in the context of an enhanced mutagenesis scenario, how many negative mutants must be generated, and what their interfering activity must be, to disrupt replication and expression of standard viral genome RNA species. However, evidence points to a collective interfering activity consistent with previous findings, based on fitness differences between entire viral populations and their component biological clones (Domingo et al., 1978, Duarte et al., 1994), of the collective behavior of mutant spectra. Such behavior renders classical models of population genetics insufficient to account for quasispecies behavior (see previous section). Therefore, the lethal defection model proposed to explain LCMV extinction by enhanced mutagenesis is in very much in line with other results that emphasize the profound biological consequences of mutant spectra behaving as an integrated ensemble (Stich et al., 2007).",

Phylograms were obtained by using the tree reconstruction analysis of Treepuzzle 5.2 (Schmidt et al., 2002) with quartet puzzling algorithm (Strimmer and von Haeseler, 1996) and an accurate parameters estimation (quartet sampling for substitution process and NJ tree for rate variation) for both the model of substitution and the mixed model of heterogeneity (1 invariable + 8 gamma rates). The model of substitution, estimated from data set was the VT model (Muller and Vingron, 2000). The number of puzzling steps was set to 10,000 and the outgroup was LCMV Armstrong. The scale indicates the maximum likelihood branch length. Numbers represent support for the internal branches of the quartet puzzling tree topology in percent.",
