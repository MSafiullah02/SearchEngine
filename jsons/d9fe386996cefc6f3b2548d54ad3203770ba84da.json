Davis-Sandfoss, MD, and BobbieJean Sweitzer, MD, FACP Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with variable clinical presentations are encountered in the perioperative setting. While some have already been diagnosed and are symptomatic, others have undiagnosed, asymptomatic COVID-19. The latter group poses the greatest risk of transmission. Given limited capacities in most health care systems, diagnostic testing is mainly performed in symptomatic patients or those with relevant exposure. We report an intraoperative diagnosis of COVID-19 in an asymptomatic patient, prompted by clinical signs.",

Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. 2 However, there is a large subset of patients who do not exhibit or report symptoms or fall into risk categories. 3 Given the risk of asymptomatic infection, special attention must be paid to patients with increased risk of exposure and infection. For example, residents of long-term care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and assisted-living facilities may be unable to effectively socially distance or quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 Additional consideration must be given to the homeless population, given the potential for similar, close living quarters, lack of hygiene options, and difficulty accessing medical care. There is dangerous potential for rapid spread of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among the aforementioned vulnerable populations. 5 Health care providers are at heightened risk when caring for certain populations considered \"low risk\" for COVID-19.",

After the surgery was completed, surgical and ancillary operating room staff left the operating room to limit possible exposure during extubation. The patient was weaned from the ventilator as she emerged from anesthesia. Blood-tinged, frothy secretions from the ETT required repeat suctioning, but she maintained adequate oxygenation on 100% Fio 2 with spontaneous ventilation. Before extubation, the previously utilized air-cushioned facemask was placed over the ETT to limit spread of secretions ( Figure 2 ). To prevent the patient from coughing on emergence, the lidocaine infusion was continued. After extubation, the mask was strapped onto the patient to create a tight seal, and the ventilator circuit delivered supplemental oxygen while the patient spontaneously breathed. The patient recovered in the operating room with only the anesthesiologists in attendance. Oxygen was weaned as tolerated to maintain Spo 2 >90%.

The patient's initial hypoxemia and PEEP requirement were attributed to deconditioning, obesity, positioning, her very large \"watermelon-sized\" breast mass, and underlying pulmonary disease. However, removal of the left breast and reverse Trendelenburg positioning did not improve the patient's pulmonary compliance or PEEP requirements, and we had no suitable explanation for her copious, bloody airway secretions. Extensive efforts were made to limit exposure to personnel and other patients perioperatively, in concordance with published recommendations. 6 As per our hospital policy, all personnel in the operating rooms were wearing N95 masks. Once suspicion of COVID-19 arose, the operating room staff were informed and asked to don additional personal protective equipment (PPE), such as isolation gowns and face shields. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed expeditiously, and the operating room was transitioned to negative pressure. In spite of copious blood-tinged, frothy secretions, suctioning was minimized to limit viral aerosolization. Because of increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from viral aerosolization during airway manipulation, 7 on completion of the surgery and before extubation, operating room staff, other than the anesthesiologists, were asked to leave. The patient recovered in the operating room and transferred wearing a surgical mask over a nasal cannula 8 directly to her inpatient room in a designated COVID-19 unit.",

Patient-reported absence of fever, cough, or exposure to individuals with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis is not sufficient to rule out COVID-19. 12 We believe preoperative screening, including formal testing, needs to be expanded to undomiciled individuals, even if they are asymptomatic, due to the challenges of social distancing and hygiene and ability to limit exposure among this population.
