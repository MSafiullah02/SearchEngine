Of particular interest is a study in which VSV expressing the H5 antigen from highly pathogenic avian influenza induced sterilizing immunity against heterologous challenge in mice [4]. In this experiment, it was impossible to detect challenge virus in lungs 3 days post-challenge. One study vaccinated and challenged macaques immunocompromised by simian\u2013human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection [3]. The vaccine was well tolerated, and protected 67% of the vaccinated subjects from lethal Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) challenge. All unvaccinated animals succumbed by day 10 post-challenge. Only the most severely immunocompromised vaccinated subjects succumbed to ZEBOV challenge. This demonstrates the safety and efficacy potential of VSV when live virus vaccination would otherwise be contraindicated.",

Therefore, it is possible for VSV to kill tumor cells, leaving healthy tissue at tumor margins unharmed. VSV is highly immunogenic, therefore, it can be detected and neutralized by the immune system before tumors are sufficiently destroyed. Introducing the anti-inflammatory glycoprotein from equine herpesvirus 1 into the VSV genome helped the virus to replicate more effectively in a rat model of hepatocellular carcinoma [7]. This resulted in a significant increase of the area of necrotic cells within the tumor. It also increased the survival of the animals.",

For instance, GenoCAD [11] was used to generate the logical representations of the therapeutic viruses reviewed in this letter (Figure 1).

            "text": "Figure 1: Logical representation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) genome structure. The natural VSV genome (a) is composed of five open reading frames bounded by a 3\u2032 leader sequence (Le) and a 5\u2032 trailer region (Tr). Sequences coding for foreign antigens can be inserted in 3\u2032 of the nucleoprotein (N) gene and between the glycoprotein (G) and large polymerase protein (L) genes. These locations are indicated by broken lines in (a). The Ebola vaccine was designed by replacing the VSV G protein with the Ebola G protein, leading to a replicating pseudotyped vector (b). Similarly, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccine was designed by replacing the VSV G protein with the SARS spike (S) protein (c). The avian influenza vaccine relies on the insertion of a sequence coding for the H5 antigen immediately next to the leader sequence (d). Interestingly, the booster vaccine carries a different variant of the VSV G protein to escape the anti-VSV immune response acquired during the primary immunization. The tuberculosis vaccine relies on the insertion of an antigen between G and L (e). The Yersinia pestis vaccine is structurally comparable to the avian influenza vaccine (f). Finally, the anti-inflammatory oncolytic VSV has a large insert between G and L. The insert includes an anti-inflammatory glycoprotein (EHV1G) and a reporter gene (Luc) separated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (g). These logical maps were generated using GenoCAD [11].",
