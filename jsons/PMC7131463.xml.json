(2) A crisis can magnify the existing problem of the government's devaluation of communication. (3) When a crisis occurs, the media scrutiny intensifies. (4) Government crises and their handlings constitute public's accumulated collective memories that are used to evaluate against the next government crisis. (5) The public often sees a government crisis as thematic rather than episodic in nature\u2014that is, they evaluate crisis within a broader context (such as a product of the government and its leadership rather than in relation to a specific episode). (6) The public often interprets the government's crisis communication as a reflection of how much the government prioritizes public good. (7) When a crisis hits, the bureaucratic nature of the public sector often magnifies in the eyes of the public. (8) The political, economic and social contexts constitute a powerful external crisis environment that often influences the government's decision.",

At the beginning of SARS, the Department of Health issued an announcement that they believed the disease had not spread to the community. Yet, another health care entity in the government, the Hospital Authority, announced that there was such possibility. In the midst of the outbreak, some officials (e.g., Ko Wing-man, the Director of Professional Services and Public Affairs) came out wearing masks, whereas some (e.g., Yeoh) did not. Even at the final stage of the SARS outbreak, the issue of mask wearing was still unsettled. While Henry Tang, the then Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology suggested to \u201cburn the masks\u201d to celebrate, Yeoh reminded the public to \u201ckeep the mask on\u201d in crowded areas. The inconsistent and anarchic messages reflected a lack of crisis control center and the breakdown of the intra-bureaucratic communications among government units.",
