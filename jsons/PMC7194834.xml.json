On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [2]. National Health Commission of China has updated several versions of the guidelines to deal with the epidemic of COVID-19 [3]. So far as we know, people of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The elderly and those with underlying diseases are more fragile to the virus. To date, hundreds of pediatric cases were documented, including neonatal infection. This situation has drawn public's attention to neonatal infection [4].",

There was no abnormal manifestation in digestion, urination, defecation, and mental reactions during hospitalization. Complete blood counts taken on the first and third day of birth did not indicate obvious abnormal, all indicators were consistent with the normal range of newborns of the same gestational age and same day of age. Some newborns\u2019 MYO and CK-MB were higher than normal values. Coagulation indexes showed that some neonatal d-dimers were higher than normal values. Although Shek and colleagues have reported that SARS-CoV cannot be transmitted from infected mothers to newborns [11], it can aggravate the clinical outcomes of mothers and newborns. Our observation demonstrated that the condition of infants was not aggravated after their exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, and we have also commented that compared to infected adults, the condition of infected children is significantly milder, with faster recovery, shorter virus shedding time and better prognosis [7]. However, one newborn in our department who was born to mother with suspected COVID-19 presented hematochezia recently, so it is still necessary to accumulate more clinical data for further understanding of maternal infection\u2019s influence on the newborn.",
