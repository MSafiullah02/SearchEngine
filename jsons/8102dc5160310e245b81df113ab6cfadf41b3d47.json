            "text": "Globally, documented cases of disease outbreaks are increasing in both frequency and intensity in many marine taxa (Burge et al., 2014; Harvell et al., 2004) . These recent increases in disease outbreaks may be caused by either the introduction of new pathogens or changes within the environment (Burge et al., 2014; Harvell et al., 2004) . Although there are many recorded disease outbreaks in invertebrates, here, we are only focusing on those diseases associated with mariculture and other commercially important marine species. We will also focus on the potential of spread of certain well documented pathogens, through specific pathways such as the transportation of commercially important species from country to country, a result which inadvertently often includes the transfer of specific pathogens capable of infecting native populations of similar species. The three most commonly cultured phyla or subphyla include that of Echinodermata, Crustacea and Mollusca. The World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties (OIE)) currently lists notifiable diseases for only the two latter groups, crustaceans and molluscs, as these are arguably the most important invertebrates on a commercial basis. However, Holothuroidea (i.e. sea cucumbers) are increasing in popularity throughout many areas of the globe and likely warrant being added to OIEs' list of notifiable diseases in the not too distant future.",

Therefore, as a result, there is limited information available on the pathogens and disease of echinoderms, crustaceans and molluscs, and this has led to a deficit in knowledge on causes of mortalities within the wild populations. Furthermore, recent work has also highlighted a difference in pathogens present in juvenile and adult populations of wild organisms (Bateman et al., 2011) . Such data is important in understanding the potential for disease to cause 'silent mortalities' (i.e. unobserved) in commercially exploited stocks. This data, also highlights that the ability to accurately assess the effect disease may have in terms of production losses in the wild is far more challenging than in a farmed environment (Stentiford et al., 2012) . In this respect an emerging disease within wild fisheries may be more difficult to identify and classify when compared to the farmed stocks. In this review, we are not listing all known diseases for the three main commercially important phyla/ sub-phyla and/or class (echinoderms, crustaceans and molluscs), but instead focus on those which likely pose a major threat and/or are infecting large populations of both wild and farmed organisms around the world. We have therefore opted to split the review into sections outlined by major pathogenic and/or parasite causal agents.",

In addition to the fact that such outbreaks in the wild can illicit dramatic changes to whole ecosystems, the increase in mariculture for certain species particular those from the class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers) has further exacerbated the need to understand diseases in this phylum. Recent improvements in artificial breeding techniques of sea cucumbers around the world have occurred rapidly. In areas of Asia, in particular the northern coast of China, rearing currently results in over 1-2 billion seeds being produced with~90,000 tonnes of sea cucumber (live weight) being harvested every year. Such rapid expansion and intensification of sea cucumber farming have subsequently led to the occurrence of various diseases, causing serious economic losses and becoming one of the limiting factors in the sustainable development of this industry. Although, little research has been conducted on these diseases so far, it is clear that in the next few years the causes and consequences of outbreaks in this group of organisms need to be understood for commercial practices to continue unabated.",

            "text": "Clinical signs and pathology: Diseased individuals first show edema in their peristomes, the tentacles cannot retract completely and adhesion capacities are weakened. This latter ailment results in diseased individuals dropping to the bottom of the ponds. Grazing rate and activity decrease and upwards of 80% eviscerate (i.e. eject their internal organs). About 2-3 days later, small white lesions usually appear on the surface of the skin and gradually expand, and increased mucus secretion is often noticed over large areas of the body wall. About 5-6 days after occurrence of the first symptoms the sea cucumbers die, with mortality often in excess of 90% (Wang et al., 2005a) . Virus-like particles (VLPs) have been found associated within the epithelium of the intestine of diseased individuals (Wang et al., 2007) . Transmission electron microscopic examinations showed that the virions are spherical, 80-100 nm in diameter, and composed of a helical nucleocapsid within an envelope with surface projections. Detailed studies on the morphogenesis of these viruses found many characteristics previously described for other coronaviruses (Wang et al., 2007) . Virus particles were found to be congregated, and always formed a virus vesicle with an encircling membrane (Wang et al., 2007) . The most obvious cellular pathologic feature appears to be large granular areas of cytoplasm, relatively devoid of organelles. Tubular structures within virus-containing vesicles, nucleocapsid inclusions, and double-membrane vesicles are also routinely found in the cytopathic cells. Furthermore, in support of a viral pathogen being the causal agent for this disease, no rickettsia, chlamydia, bacteria, or other parasitic organisms have been seen to be associated with any of the diseased tissues sampled (Wang et al., 2007) . Furthermore, these VLPs are only present in diseased individuals and absent in healthy animals. However, no infection trials have been conducted to date. Therefore, further evidence is required to prove that these VLPs are the aetiological agent. Interestingly, the same VLPs have also been observed in diseased larvae (30 days old). This latter finding suggests that the disease may be transmitted vertically from parents, which may have severe implications for transportation of brood stock from pond to pond.",

            "text": "In addition, like many marine diseases, researchers are only recently searching for viruses associated with these diseases. Indeed, two distinct virus like particles have now been observed associated with the disease lesions (Wang et al., 2005a; Wang et al., 2007) . These include, a spherical virus with a diameter of 80-100 nm and a spherical virus with a nucleocapsid and diameter of 120-250 nm (Wang et al., 2005a; Wang et al., 2007) . The latter of the two has been named, skin ulceration and peristome tumescence syndrome virus (SUPTSV) (Liu et al., 2010) . Crude experimental inoculation trials, which included the addition of filtered tissue extracts (i.e. supposedly only containing viruses) to otherwise healthy individuals elicited similar disease signs, suggesting that the proposed virus does indeed play an important role in disease onset. Interestingly, the disease signs produced from the bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen, although resulting in the same overall pathology had certain differences. For example, inoculation with the bacterial pathogens included ulcer spots on the dorsal skin and abdominal parapodia, followed by an increase in the number and merging of ulcer spots and a decrease or loss of tentacle activity. In comparison symptoms caused by inoculation of the viral pathogen included an initial decrease in tentacle activity or loss of activity all together, peristome tumescence and the decay of dorsal papillate podia and peristome, along with abdominal ulceration. These differences suggest that the virus first affects the function of cells in tentacles and peristome, whereas bacteria initially cause ulceration of the skin. Finally, its worthy of note here that unidentified platyhelminths are often observed in diseased tissue and they are thought to cause heavy damage to the skin. The size of the worms is variable, normally ranging from 50 to 130 mm. Histological observations demonstrate that there is an abundance of worms in the tissues of the lesion area. They occupy a large space within the tissues and cause topical necrosis and scattering of the musculature (Wang et al., 2005a; Wang et al., 2007) . However, exactly how these worms fit into the overall pathology of this disease remains unknown.",

However there are slight differences in the way the disease often manifests itself, suggesting that there may actually be multiple diseases currently under this one banner. For example in Australia and Madagascar, white lesions are observed to appear near the cloacal orifice and extends over the whole body, whilst in China, the white lesions have been noted to occur on any part of the body, begin canking and then extend over the whole body surface (Mercier et al., 2005; Yin-Geng et al., 2005) . This disease usually results in chronic mortalities, with cumulative rates reported of 30-50%. Generally, infected individuals die within 3-15 days of the first clinical signs being observed. Skin ulceration begins with the appearance of small white patches (ca. 1 mm in diameter), which enlarge and eventually expose the underlying muscle and spicules. Yet, the mesothelium, the muscles and the internal organs remain unaffected. Podia inside lesions are often totally destroyed. Juveniles have been reported to show less motivation once they had contracted the disease and become translucent (Mercier et al., 2005; Yin-Geng et al., 2005) . Scanning electron micrographs show two distinct 'zones' associated with this disease. The first, where the epidermis and cuticle are totally destroyed and where disorganized connective tissue is exposed has been refered to as the 'affective zone' and appears to be colonised by numerous different types of microorganisms. The second 'zone' is the borderline area of infestation, a few tens of micrometres wide where the surface is again colonised by a mix of microorganisms and where patches of degrading epidermis are mixed with degrading, exposed connective tissue. In the 'affected zone', collagen fibres run in all directions, breaking off from each other and ossicles, some of which appear highly degraded, are exposed to the external medium.",

After 2-3 days, the viscera are ejected out of the body and the sea cucumbers succumb shortly afterwards. More than 50% of hatcheries have been known to exhibit this disease, with more than 90% mortality in some areas. Previously VRS was characterised in the same disease group as SUD (see above), however Deng et al. (2009) argued that due to substantial differences in pathology, these diseases should be classed as separate diseases/syndromes. There are four main reasons which led Deng and colleagues to suggest a separation of these diseases. Primarily, sea cucumbers suffering from SUD rarely exhibit signs of viscera ejection but do exhibit peristome edema expanding to the whole body. A second reason for this proposed separation of diseases is that after dissection of infected individuals the majority of those with SUD (over 90%) had satiation intestines in coelom. In comparison, those with VRS (again upwards of 90% of infected individuals) had no intestines within their coeloms. Furthermore, both diseases show differences in their mortality rates and have different methods proposed for prevention. SUD for example has been shown to be treatable with antibiotics (slowing the spread), with mortality usually around 50%. In contrast VRS shows high infectivity, rapid spread, little response to antibiotic treatment and usually 80-100% mortality. Finally, although no definitive causal agents have been proposed for either disease state, the general consensus over the causal agents seems to differ between diseases.",

Annual production of farmed and captured crustaceans exceeds 10 M metric tonnes with a first sale value of $40bn, with the sector being dominated by farmed tropical marine shrimp. Strikingly, current estimates predict that up to 40% of total shrimp production is lost annually (N$3bn) and this loss is mainly accredited to disease. The World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties (OIE)) currently lists 8 notifiable crustacean diseases, 6 of which are viral in origin, 1 bacterial and 1 protistan. Three of the viral diseases in particular are also listed within European legislation, EC Council Directive 2006/88/EC. Although viral pathogens appear to exert the most significant constraints on the growth and survival of crustacea under culture conditions, protozoan pathogens appear to elicit the greatest detriment effects in wild populations, and affect the marketability of products harvested from these hosts (Stentiford et al., 2012) .",

Virions are ovoid or ellipsoid to rod-shaped and consist of an electron dense nucleocapsid, with a tight fitting capsid layer, surrounded by a loose-fitting trilaminar envelope. Virions measure 120-150 nm in diameter and 270-290 nm in length and in some cases a tail like projection can be seen extending from one end. WSSV virions possess a very distinctive capsid layer giving the DNA core a cross-hatched or striated appearance (Wu et al., 2005) .",

Furthermore, WSSV was also successfully transmitted to Homarus gammarus, which were fed on these infected supermarket-derived shrimp, suggesting a possible pathway for WSSV to infect other species such as lobsters and highlighting a pathway for this disease to infect European crustacean stocks in the future (Bateman et al., 2012a) .

To date, other crustaceans including freshwater shrimp and crabs appear to be resistant to the disease but may also be potential carriers. Certain species of birds and the water-boatmen, Trichocorixa reticulata have been proposed as possible mechanical vectors (Brock, 1997) which are capable or transporting the disease from pond to pond, therefore making control of this disease very difficult.

This is mainly because there is strong evidence of genetic recombination between the different genotypes (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2009) . Again similar to WSSV and TSV, YHD is listed as an OIE notifiable disease and as an exotic disease within Europe, EC Council Directive 2006/88/ EC.",

The Vibrio is also thought to be infected by a virus known as a phage, which causes the release of a potent toxin (Tran et al., 2013) , a result which causes the particular signs of the disease. A similar phenomenon occurs in the human disease cholera, where a phage makes the Vibrio cholerae bacterium capable of producing a toxin that causes cholera's life-threatening diarrhoea. To date, it remains unclear as to whether or not all incidences of EMS/AHPND are caused by one or more strains of V. parahaemolyticus.

(2014) suggests that this practice may do more harm than good. Upon restocking, the increase in nutrient availability, decreased microbial community and consequent lack of competition may favour fast growing bacteria, such is the case with the genus Vibrio. The authors go on to suggest that microbial management practices may be the best solution to control this disease (De Schryver et al., 2014) . The development of diagnostic tests for rapid detection of the EMS/AHPNS pathogen is ongoing, which will enable improved management of hatcheries and ponds, and help lead to a long-term solution for this disease. This will also enable a better evaluation of risks associated with importation of frozen shrimp or other products from countries affected by EMS/AHPND. In fact, some countries have already implemented policies that restrict the importation of frozen shrimp or other products from EMS/AHPND-affected countries. However, research currently indicates that EMS/AHPND does not survive cooking or freezing, and repeated attempts to transmit the disease using frozen tissue have so far been unsuccessful (Lightner et al., 2012) . Therefore, frozen shrimp are likely to pose a low risk for contamination of wild shrimp or the environment because EMS/AHPND-infected shrimp are typically very small and do not enter international commerce, so although this disease is damaging and worthy of note in this review, the potential for spread to other countries should be relatively limited.",

Although, predominantly associated with H. americanus, the pathogen has been recorded in low prevalence in other crustacean species in the wild such as Libinia emarginata, Carcinus maenas, Cancer borealis, Cancer irroratus and Penaeus aztecus (Alderman, 1996) . Furthermore, experimentally, the disease has been transferable to Panulirus interruptus, Pandalus platyceros, Cancer irroratus, Cancer magister, Geryon quinquedens, Chionoecetes opilio and Callinectes sapidus (Alderman, 1996) . The diverse number of species this pathogen has been associated with clearly shows the dramatic influence epidemics of this disease can have on the crustacean populations and the whole ecosystem in general. Enzootics in both wild populations and captive animals are relatively common off the American/Canadian coast line and reports have occurred in cultured lobsters in California, however prevalence was reportedly low (Stewart, 1975) . Despite the high number of species which have been shown to be susceptible to this disease, the pathogen had not been reported to be present in European waters until relatively recently. In 2011, the press reported the capture of an American lobster off the coast of Devon, Southern UK (Stebbing et al., 2012a) . The lobster caught, had blue bands around its claws, indicative of being caught and tossed overboard by a passing ship. This lobster tested positive for Gaffkaemia and this spread real concern of the possibility that European lobsters H. gammarus, could have been exposed to this devastating disease. Since this first report, and a further positive outbreak in a European lobster holding facility in South Wales, a base line survey was conducted to test the presence or absence of the disease in wild populations of H. gammarus around the east coast of England and Wales (Stebbing et al., 2012b) . Results showed that although Gaffkaemia was detected in wild populations, its prevalence was low (positive in b 1% of those tested). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis conducted on the strains of A. viridians var. homari collected from the UK wild lobsters, those in the Welsh holding facility and examples from the USA and Canada showed that the isolates were identical, supporting the theory that this pathogen has been introduced into the UK, likely with the release of American lobsters, H. americanus. Although the increase in H. americanus in UK waters is of great concern and has the potential to cause a pandemic of Gaffkaemia, there are reports that there was a previous outbreak in England in the 1960s, although this is difficult to confirm (Stebbing et al., 2012b) . To date, however no other European crustaceans have been tested for the presence of this pathogen and future studies should focus on assessing the extent of the problem in European waters.",

Generally diseased lobsters are found in waters ranging from 10 to 16\u00b0C, interestingly above temperatures of 22\u00b0C, virulence of A. viridians var. homari has been shown to reduce significantly (Steenbergen et al., 1978) .",

Juvenile crabs have shown high prevalence (27%) for the pathogen with peaks (at 80% prevalence) occurring in March (Bateman et al., 2011) . The fact that the parasite is only observed in juvenile life stages may indicate that the parasite is causing mortality within these infected crabs, hence removing them from the population. If this is the case, the disease could likely have a devastating impact upon the fishery and further work is urgently needed to investigate the effect this parasite may have upon edible crab populations around the UK.",

Specifically, devastating impacts have been recorded for numerous crab populations worldwide (Small, 2012) , as infections are more often than not fatal. There have been various disease names associated with this parasite, which is due to the various characteristics of the disease in each species. These include: bitter crab disease (in Chionoecetes spp.) (Meyers et al., 1987) , pink crab disease (in Cancer pagurus) (Stentiford et al., 2002) , milky disease (in Portunus trituberculatus, Scylla serrata) (Eddy et al., 2007; Li et al., 2008b) , yellow water disease (in S. serrata) and milky shrimp disease (in Exopalaemon carinicauda) . This condition causes massive losses to wild crustacean populations and associated fisheries (Small, 2012) and has recently been associated with losses in cultured crabs and shrimp in China, with losses of up to 100% having been reported in these farms. The now increasingly common practice of rearing several different species in the same pond (known as polyculture) is likely a significant contributing factor towards transmission of the parasite between species and the occurrence of Hematodinium infections within E. carinicauda has obvious implications for the culture of other economically important shrimp species (Small, 2012) . Following the emergence of Hematodinium in aquaculture in China Li et al., 2008b) , Small (2012) proposed that Hematodinium meets the criteria for listing as an emerging aquatic animal disease and suggested that the listing of this disease should be considered by the OIE.",

Aquacultured shellfish include various oyster, mussel and clam species. These bivalves are filter and/or deposit feeders, which rely on ambient primary production rather than inputs of fish or other feed. As such, shellfish aquaculture is generally perceived as benign or even beneficial in some cases. Depending on the species and local conditions, bivalve molluscs are either grown on beaches, on longlines, or suspended from rafts and harvested by hand or by dredging. Overfishing and poaching have reduced wild populations of many commercially important species such as abalones to the brink of extinction and increased farming activity is proposed as a measure to reduce wild collections and ultimately conserve wild stocks. However, as with other farming practices, increased densities of mollusca in these farms often result in disease outbreaks and the pathogens effectively cultured in these packed conditions can easily affect wild stocks as well.",

As is becoming a common theme throughout this review, prevalence of this disease has been associated with increases in average sea surface temperatures and overcrowding (Sauvage et al., 2009) . To date, this condition has been recorded throughout much of Europe and especially in France and around Ireland. Mortality associated with OsHV-1 is primarily observed among oysters less than one year of age, although all ages of oysters have been recorded as contracting the disease at some point. A harmonised approach has also now been implemented between EU member states with regard to managing and mitigating the spread of this disease, particularly focusing at trying to keep the virus from UK waters (Murray et al., 2012) , which at the time of writing show only a few isolated cases of infection (Murray et al., 2012) . Given the economic importance of oyster aquaculture in many European countries, the EU Commission Regulation n. 175/2010 was enacted in March 2010 to identify the presence of OsHV-1 \u03bcvar associated with mortality in oysters in order to reduce the spread of the virus to uninfected regions. According to the regulation, disease control measures must be implemented which include the establishment of containment areas and the restriction of movement from these areas if OsHV-1 \u03bcvar and accompanying mortality is identified. In addition to affecting the pacific oyster in Europe, reports of POMS have also been made in two estuaries in New South Wales, Australia (Paul-Pont et al., 2014) highlighting another potential problem area which needs to be monitored and managed to mitigate further spread.",

Furthermore, isolated cultures of V. aestuarianus have been shown to induce similar disease pathologies in inoculation trials under controlled laboratory conditions. Alarmingly, prevalence of this pathogen in certain populations appears to be increasing. In 2012 for example, V. aestuarianus was detected in 100% of moribund adults tested, whereas only a few individuals tested positive in 2009 and 2010 (Wendling et al., 2014) . Interestingly, all oysters which tested positive in 2012 had isolates which matched those from French oysters (Wendling et al., 2014) . Furthermore the virulence of specific isolates also appears to be increasing, with this particular French isolate being particularly pathogenic (Wendling et al., 2014) . Similarly, isolates of V. aestuarianus from infected oysters in Ireland have shown to induce very high mortalities of otherwise healthy C. gigas within only a few days of inoculation. However, despite this apparent increase in virulence, there is no evidence to suggest that new strains are responsible for the current outbreaks and future research should focus on assessing the environmental conditions that could potentially favour this apparent increase in virulence.",

In the latter instances, Marteilia have been shown to be transmitted from infected oysters and infected mussels to healthy copepods.

In conjunction, M. refringens has also been detected in P. grani copepodid stages between June and November strengthening the hypothesis of the transmission of the parasites from copepods to mussels. In addition, in-situ end labelling showed that the Marteilia were present within the digestive tracts and gonads of the 3rd copepodid stages .

The parasite may also interfere directly with the host feeding and absorption simply by its physical presence. Death is usually attributed to direct blockage of the digestive gland by the parasite and consequent host starvation. Mature spores of Marteilia spp. are released into the environment via the lumen of the digestive tubules and intestine. This release is associated with destruction of the host digestive gland epithelia with cases observed whereby the secondary digestive tubules have been totally destroyed by the release of the spores. The parasite evolves from early stages, usually observed in the epithelia of the upper digestive tract, such as the palps and stomach. In some rare cases they have been observed to develop in the gills. Sporulation takes place within the epithelium of the digestive gland tubules. Sporangia are released in the lumen of the digestive tract and this is when the destruction of the digestive gland epithelia usually occurs.",

Two species, Perkinsus marinus and Perkinsus olseni, are given particular attention due to their impact on aquaculture practices (Cho and Park, 2010; Ford, 1996) , and each parasite is listed as a separate OIE notifiable disease. However, with regard to P. marinus (originally described as Dermocystidium marinum, from which the abbreviation 'dermo' refers), differences in virulence have now been shown to occur between isolates separated geographically (Thompson et al., 2014) . This suggests that there may be numerous strains with differences in genetic composition, geographic distribution and virulence. Similarly, variability in the pathogenicity of P. olseni raises questions on the existence of different strains as well. Alternatively, or additionally there may also be differences in host responses under different environmental conditions, which further study should be able to highlight.",

In addition to severely affecting wild populations, this disease has been shown to occur in farms. However outbreaks can be reduced by culturing oysters in waters with salinity below 12 to 15 ppt (Cook et al., 1998) . In the wild, season salinities, around 12 ppt, appear favorable for supporting full dermo disease outbreaks, so in theory areas most at risk from these disease outbreaks can be identified by local salinity patterns (Cook et al., 1998) . Perkinsus proliferates at temperatures higher than 20\u00b0C and in warm, southern waters 'dermo' has been recorded as decimating up to 50% of oyster beds each year (Cook et al., 1998) . The parasites are transmitted directly between individual oysters, primarily when the oysters are in advanced stages of infection, die and then disintegrate. New infections are acquired as oysters feed, the parasite infecting its hosts through the gut epithelia. Interestingly, it has been reported that most serious outbreaks occur during drought years, so as climate change is predicted to increase periods of draught in many areas of the globe, increases in this disease may also likely occur. Areas such as in the gulf of Mexico are also likely to see increases in this disease, as dermo has been linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle (Cook et al., 1998) , with serious outbreaks regularly following the arrival of warm, dry, La Nina climatic conditions.",

We are, however, beginning to understand how certain species may play specific roles. For example, B. ostreae appears to mainly infect the haemocytes of infected oysters and transmission appears to be direct from infected to na\u00efve oysters. The parasites enter through epithelia from palleal organs including the gills. Once they have passed the epithelium barrier, they are internalized within haemocytes which in turn contribute to the spread of the parasite in all the other organs. Multiplication of B. ostreae occurs inside the haemocytes and is associated with a decrease of esterases and production of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the modulation of apopotosis and decrease of phagocytosis has also been proposed as being important mechanisms related to resistance to these parasites (Engelsma et al., 2014) . B. ostreae, affects the granular blood cells (haemocytes) of the host. Lesions occur in the connective tissue of the gills, mantle and digestive gland. The parasite multiplies by binary fission. Ten or more parasites have been observed within an infected haemocyte. More rarely, during the terminal stages of the disease, a larger plasmodial form can occur, this contains between 3 and 5 nuclei.",

A combined approach of both PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) would give the greatest chance of detecting this pathogen in hosts. For primers and protocols see Carnegie et al. (2003) and Meyer et al. (2005) . Interestingly, this latter study showed that only 70% of the positive oysters diagnosed with these techniques were found infected via the normal histological procedure, highlighting the importance of well validated diagnosis technqiues. Finally, it is worthy of note that a very closely related parasite, initially identified in C. gigas has also been found causing a similar pathology to Denman Island Disease in O. lurida in Canada. This has now been named as a new species from the same genus, Mikrocytos boweri sp. nov. (Hartikainen et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "This review highlights the importance and strikingly large numbers of diseases prevalent in three main commercially important marine invertebrate phyla/sub-phyla and/or class. We highlight a dramatic skew in the knowledge available between different phyla, particularly associated with the level of importance these groups are given based on their importance in aquaculture and as a sustainable food source. Specifically, species in the sub phylum Crustacea and the phylum Mollusca are extensively studied in contrast to Holothuroidea, although there remains a large amount of unknowns with regard to specific diseases and parasites/pathogens even in these two groups. Interestingly, especially with regard to mariculture, researchers appear to be well advanced with regard to viral work for both Crustacea and Mollusca. Even with regard to bacterial induced diseases, the discovery of how phages interact with the proposed pathogens, highlights the importance viruses play not just in disease but also with regard to healthy systems. Finally, and more importantly, this review highlights the very real risk of the continued spread of specific pathogens around the globe. This is likely to occur either via the introduction of the hosts (during set up of different aquaculture practices for example) or alternatively via the transmission of the pathogens themselves (by transport in the ballast waters of ships or through the aquarium trade). Despite the well documented cases of disease spread, it is surprising that we appear to not be able to learn from these past mistakes and are continuing the transport diseased individuals or vectors around the globe. Specifically a call for more control appears to be needed, implemented in the movement of live individuals and also frozen food to attempt to seriously minimize further spread of novel pathogens and those already described.",

Therefore, we can only suggest that the best strategy to minimize stocks contracting disease at the current time should be robust management. For example, broodstocks used for reproduction should be healthy without any signs of pathogens which will avoid vertical infections occurring. Stocking density should be adapted to the environmental conditions, culture method and experienceovercrowded conditions would lower resistance to diseases. Individuals should be fed with high quality diets that are supplemented with necessary elements including vitamins and minerals. Water quality should be maintained by keeping an optimum stocking density, avoiding over feeding and increasing water exchange rates whilst monitoring the water quality on a daily basis. All equipment and tools should be disinfected before use or before transfer from one tank to another and excess food, faeces and other organic wastes should be siphoned and removed as quickly as possible. Finally, if a disease is detected, actions and effective measures should be taken and moribund individuals should be removed from the tanks and be properly disposed. As a last resort antibiotics should only be used when the causative pathogen(s) have been confirmed (see above for which diseases this relates to). Although the above will assist in reducing disease spread in mariculture, they do not relate to spread in wild populations, yet any improvements which can occur in aquaculture husbandry may reduce the risk to wild populations and limit the spread into these environments as well.",
