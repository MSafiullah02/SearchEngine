            "text": "Clustering of ligand-binding receptors of different types on thickened isles of the cell membrane, namely lipid rafts, is an experimentally observed phenomenon. Although its influence on cell's response is deeply investigated, the role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding has not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the widest group of transmembrane proteins in animals, which regulate specific cell processes through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the intracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by the Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and kinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon both the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active receptors -in full agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels-and how the latter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome onist binding using quenching experiments. Their results can best be explained by either a rotation of TM6 and a tilting of TM6 toward TM5 during agonist-induced activation of the receptor. The structure, activation, and signaling of a GPCR is heavily influenced by the bilayer environment. This influence seems likely to involve either indirect bilayer effects, specific membrane-GPCR interactions, or a combination of both ( Chini and Parenti, 2004; Drake et al., 2006; Oates and Watts, 2011 ) .",

            "text": "It has been reported that specific properties of this environment result in co-localization with downstream signaling components providing a rationale for regulation and specificity in GPCR activation ( Ostrom and Insel, 2004; Patel et al., 2008 ) . Some subsets of GPCRs are preferentially segregated to discrete regions of the membrane defined as lipid rafts ( Barnett-Norris et al., 2005; Becher and McIlhinney, 2005; Bridge et al., 1998; Chini and Parenti, 2004; Foster et al., 2003; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2005; Jiao et al., 1996; Ostrom and Insel, 2004; Patel et al., 2008; Shukla, 2016; Villar et al., 2016; Watkins et al., 2011 ) . Despite lipid rafts are involved in a number of biologically relevant phenomena and their formation has been demonstrated to often serve as entry port for some viruses, including SARS-CoV ones ( Lu et al., 2008 ) , why is this the case and what is the physics at the basis of the associated remodelling of the lipid membrane remain still open questions ( Fallahi-Sichani Schematic representation of the ligand-binding between epinephrine (red dots on the top-left) and GPCRs (left, formed by seven cylindrical Transmembrane Domains-TMs) with production of intracellular and extracellular cyclic-Adenosine MonoPhosphate-cAMP-in the presence of transporters-MRPs (yellow unit to the right). Intermediate units are the G-protein (brown circle, near the GPCRS) and the Adenylate Cyclase (purple unit, across the membrane). The surface density of GPCRs bound to ligands is denoted by \u03be , while the analog for MRPs is labelled as \u03b6 . The letters A, B, C and D display the order in which the chain of events occurs from the time in which ligand-binding takes place to the effects of the cell response through the production of intracellular and extracellular cAMP. The scheme highlights that a broad spectrum inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, labelled as PDE, is accounted for ( Biondi et al., 2010 ) . Helical domains forming the GPCR are displayed as cylinders in the figure: the TMs, where TM3, TM5 and TM6 have been reported in colors, to highlight their conformational changes. The latter are displayed at the bottom of this figure. They consist in a rotation ( \u03c9) of such domains about their axis, orthogonal to the (local) mid plane of the membrane (whose unit vector is denoted by e 3 ), and on the shear ( \u03bc) of TM6 approximately towards TM5, in the direction s , whose components in the local mid-plane are also displayed in the figure (see e.g. Ghanouni et al., 2001 ) . (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) and Linderman, 2009; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2005; Jacobson et al., 2007 ) . Lipid raft are highly dynamic thickened areas on the lipid membrane with different dimensions and a complex heterogeneous composition. This is due to the fact that such rafts host a variety of transmembrane proteins responsible of compartmentalizing cellular processes to isolated districts of the cell. These planar regions form localized microdomains on the cell membrane and are hard to be directly observable in vivo ( Dharani, 2015; Risselada and Marrink, 2008 ) . In particular, they appear as dynamic nanoscale assemblies, where a high glycosphingolipid and cholesterol content in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer is present. This composition gives them a gel-like liquid-ordered organisation in comparison with the surrounding phospholipid-rich disordered membrane ( Chini and Parenti, 2004; Lingwood and Simons, 2010 ) .",

            "text": "The interplay between lipids and proteins is known to influence the overall behavior of the cell membrane. In particular,the adenosine A1, \u03b11-AR, \u03b21-AR, \u03b22-AR, AT1R, the endothelin (ETA-A and ET-B) receptors, and the M2-muscarinic receptors have all been localized to lipid rafts and/or caveolae ( Drake et al., 2006 ) . The association of \u03b22AR with caveolin3 in myocytes membranes has been demonstrated, as well as the fact that the confinement of \u03b22-AR to caveolae is of critical im-portance for regulation of the intrinsic contraction rate in these membrane preparations ( Xiang et al., 2002 ) . How cholesterol modifies GPCR activity appears very much receptor-dependent, with regards to both upregulation and downregulation and of direct and indirect action ( Hanson et al., 2008; Oates and Watts, 2011 ) . The mechanical and chemical response of these amazing structures depends on many factors, such as the shape of the membrane, the temperature of the environment, the osmotic pressure, the chemical composition of lipid mixture, etc. Hu et al. (2012) , Norouzi et al. (2006) , Agrawal and Steigmann (2008) , Agrawal and Steigmann (2009) , Walani et al. (2015) , Baumgart et al. (2003) , Baumgart et al. (2005) , Honerkamp-Smith et al. (2008) . Depending on the presence of embedded specialized proteins into the lipid membrane, several predicting models have been developed ( Agrawal and Steigmann, 20 09; Biscari and Bisi, 20 02; Canham, 1970; Deseri et al., 2008; 2015; Deseri and Zurlo, 2013; Jenkins, 1977; Rangamani et al., 2014; Walani et al., 2015; Zurlo, 2006 ) . Most of them are based on the characterization of the energy, with the aim of predicting the ordered-disordered phenomena arising in transition regions for contrasting the external stimuli. Indeed, thickness reduction of the bilayer is observed by changing the mechanical and chemical conditions in the environment surrounding the cell. For this reason, several Authors adopted the change in thickness as order parameter for studying such kind of systems ( Goldstein and Leibler, 1989; Owicki and McConnell, 1979; Sackmann, 1995 ) . Without explicitly doing so, a theory for the chemo-mechanical coupling of lipid bilayers accounting for curvature changes, viscosity, diffusion and L o \u2212 L d phase transitions has recently been presented in ( Sahu et al., 2017 ) . The L o \u2212 L d phase transition has been modelled through a dimensionless order parameter related to the fraction of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, known as DOPC. This is known to exhibit disordered features in agreement with the curliness of the tails mentioned above. Furthermore, binding and diffusion of certain proteins, epsin-1, is thoroughly analyzed. As pointed out above, the physical behavior of such membranes is regulated by many factors enabling the occurrence of out-of-plane tractions, while in-plane shear stresses are not transmitted unless their viscosity is accounted for.",

In order to predict the dynamic remodelling of the cell membrane, following thermodynamic arguments, a chemo-mechanical coupling is found for the obtained chemical potentials of such species. These potentials regulate active species diffusion through mass balance which, in turn, involves the kinetics of binding through the occurence of interspecific terms. The potentials of the active species determine a corresponding coupling for the resulting energetics. Furthermore, it is found that the chemo-mechanical coupling found for such potentials is the specific work exerted by the lateral pressure (arising across the membrane thickness) against the volume changes around the interaction sites among the species domains and the surrounding lipids. It is worth noting that accounting for the aspects mentioned above enables mechanobiology to give a mechanically-based justification to the experimental findings of Nobel Prizes 2012 Kobilka ( Kobilka and Deupi, 2007 ) and Leifkovitz ( Lefkowitz, 2007 ) .",

The occurrence of a Multidrug Resistant Protein (MRP)-dependent cAMP efflux is also shown in human first-trimester placenta explants. Extracellular cAMP has been hypothesized to represent a source for adenosine formation that, in turn, could modulate cAMP-dependent responses in placental tissue.

To this aim, the cell membrane is modelled as a thin hyperelastic soft body on which active receptors with density \u03be and transporters (i.e. MRPs-Multidrug Resistant Proteins) with density \u03b6 mediate the communication between the extra-cellular and the intra-cellular environment. Receptor-Ligand (RL) compounds and MRPs directly initiate different signaling pathways involved in different cell processes, regulated by the transport and compartmentation of chemicals such as cyclic-AMP. Measuring cAMP concentrations then allows to indirectly estimate the amount of surface proteins involved, as explained in Section 2 . There the experiments used to trace the levels of receptors and transporters are described. In the proposed model, the cell membrane is characterized according to the constitutive framework proposed by Deseri et al. (2008) , Deseri and Zurlo (2013) , Zurlo (2006) . Here, this is explicitly coupled with the dynamics of GPCRs and MRPs activation, apt to describe the growth of active domains on the membrane surface by means of flow rules that include the receptor-transporter interplay. This dynamics is modelled according to a theory of interspecific growth mechanics recently proposed by Fraldi and Carotenuto (2018) , Carotenuto et al. (2018) and applied to model the growth of solid tumors. Here, the same framework is adapted to model the kinetics and diffusion of transmembrane proteins triggered by ligand-binding and mediated by the membrane elasticity. Upon utilizing this approach, the evolution equations for the species provide Lotka-Volterra-inspired interspecific terms aimed to model the response of GPCRs to affine ligands and the growth of RL complex. The latter stimulate the activation of MRPs through the intracellular cAMP production. In turn, it is observed a localization of islands of active receptors and transporters on thickened domains of the cell membrane, known as lipid rafts. Such remodelling phenomenon is then governed by kinetics, diffusion and energetics, where binding/unbinding events turn out to be strongly coupled to the mechanical response of the plasma membrane through the energetics. Indeed, the mechanical interaction between the membrane and the active proteins during their remodelling and the conformational changes of their domains can be traced through the growth of their corresponding fractions.",

To this end, a total Helmoltz free energy per unit volume is introduced, say W * , accounting for both the response of the lipid bilayer and the energetics associated to the proteins changes. In particular, the rearrangement of protein domains on the cell membrane is modelled as a process of growth via pure densification ( Lubarda and Hoger, 2002 ) , i.e. by considering the effect of the variation of the density of activated proteins on the free-energy of the membrane. In fact, by considering a membrane element with mass d m 0 = \u03c1 0 d V 0 in the inactive (virgin) configuration, as displayed in Fig. 5 , the potential activation of previously dormant receptors on the membrane is likely assumed not to produce mass variation. However, the submacroscopic changes following the formation of receptor-ligand binding induce remodelling and conformational changes of the bonded receptors across the membrane. This is because the variation of the density and of the conformations of those receptors determine the re-organization of the surrounding lipids (see the Appendix C ). By denoting with the superscript a the active (reference) configuration in which protein activation occurs (see the intermediate global configuration of the membrane in Fig. 5 ), the remodelling K r affecting the mass element can be written as follows (see the Appendix A ):",

This is done by taking into account intrinsic rates as well as mutual interactions with other fields characterizing the system by means of suitable coupling terms. The present model mainly focuses on the active receptors and transport proteins on the cell membrane. In particular, in the presence of a specific ligand, binding and activation GPCRs kindles cytoplasmatic signaling pathways. The latter allow for both regulating some intracellular processes and communicating with the extra-cellular environment by expelling molecules through the activation of specific transport proteins, such as MRPs. This coupled mechanism can be followed in practice by measuring the levels of intracellular and extracellular concentrations of cAMP, involved in many physiological processes of the cell. In particular, intracellular cAMP production follows the response of the GPCRs to certain ligands, such as epinephrine. The level of cytoplasmatic cAMP is modulated by MRPs that permit the efflux of cAMP from the interior of the cell to the extracellular fluid. In this way, MRPs control cell homeostasis and determine an agonist interaction with membrane receptors. In order to trace the interplay of the transmembrane proteins, we introduce mass balances for two selected species, n 1 = \u03be , representing the G proteins, and n 2 = \u03b6 , namely the transport proteins.

Upon comparing this finding with the experimentally determined intracellular cAMP (cAMP i ) normalized concentration, an estimate of the binding Receptor-Ligand (RL) compounds is provided according to (2.2) . This is because GPCRs activation directly triggers the cell response by initiating the cAMP signaling pathway. Homeostatic levels of cAMP i are restored thanks to the activation of the Multidrug Resistant transport Proteins (MRPs) driving the efflux of part of the produced cAMP towards the extracellular environment. It is worth noting that a very good agreement is found between the predicted MRPs fraction and the (normalized) increase of cAMP e . Furthermore, Fig. 7 A displays the simultaneous evolution of the ordered (thicker) phases. The latter evolve with similar trends in both the unconfined and the tensed membranes, exception made for the load-induced shrinkage in the initial stage, when chemical stress P n = K r \u03c9 i (n 0 i \u2212 n i ) /\u03bb 2 (introduced in (3.49) ) is not yet acting. At the time at which such stress is maximum, i.e t 642 s in the simulations, a clear spatial correspondence between active domains and raft formation can be recognized in all situations, see Fig. 7 B.

In particular, as also shown in Fig. 8 , analyses revealed that lipid rafts formation is mainly affected by the level of intrinsic rate of activation in response to ligand concentration \u03b1 \u03be (through the uptake coefficient k b ), and the chemo-mechanical coefficient \u03c9 \u03be , representing the specific mechanical work that GPCRs exert on the lipid membrane by inducing its thickening.",

The chemical potential of the species is then key for understanding the mechanobiology involved in ligand-binding of the receptors analyzed in this paper. Because of its high importance, in this section we provide a more physical understanding of the origins of such a key quantity. Indeed, direct considerations at the microscale can be performed by taking into account the lateral pressure arising between the active species domains and the adjacent lipids within the bilayer. Lateral pressure in lipid membranes is known to be present in bilayers even without receptors. It is worth noting that lateral pressure is known to contribute to the stress across the thickness. In mechanical terms, such a pressure can be seen as the reaction to incompressibility, thereby not affecting the elastic part of the energy. When it comes to considering the membrane stress, formed by a hyperelastic part added on a reactive one, the lateral pressure is indeed such a term in the expression for the stress. In turn, the lateral pressure changes in the presence of proteins (see e.g. Cantor, 1999; Lee, 2004; Marsh, 2007; Ollila, 2010 ) and it influences their chemical potential. For the sake of illustration, in the sequel we focus on the active receptors, namely the RL complex, as reported in Pollaci (2016) . In Fig. 12 it is shown a schematic of a TM domain involved in the conformational changes and the lateral pressure RL profile \u02c6 \u03c0 ( x , z, t ) (marked with the green line in Fig. 12 .b) .",

Obviously there is a one-to-one relationship between the configurational changes described (through H ) from the classically deformed configuration to the current configuration and their description starting from the virgin configuration (through K ). Indeed, pure geometry is suggestive of the fact that the deformation of the membrane plays a key role (through F = Grad y ) on carrying over the information related to the conformational changes, as K = F \u22121 H F . It is worth noting that the definition of the remodelling factor introduced in (3.21) can be exactly written as K r = det K , (C.1) as the change in volume between the virgin configuration and the reference configuration is solely due to disarrangements which, in this case, are due to (submacroscopic) remodelling. Furthermore, it is obvious that d et K = d et H . Henceforth, the evaluation of the remodelling factor can either be done upon following the scheme displayed in Fig. 11 ( ( y , F ) \u2022 ( i , K ) , namely by letting disarrangements to act first, then followed by a classical deformation) or the one in Fig. 13 ( ( i , H ) \u2022 ( y , F ) , i.e. a classical deformation first, then the conformational changes).",

The local translation measure is relative to the free volume available for the conformational changes in the current configuration. This is calculated by multiplying the current value of the thickness h of the cell membrane by the available area \u03c0 ( d 0 /2) 2 J , where d 0 represents the referential Table 3  Table 3 . Ranges of values of geometrical parameters assumed from ( Hiden et al., 2007; Lee, 2004; Pollaci, 2016 ) , while the room space \u03c1T is estimated from Fig. 14 diameter of the zone in which conformational changes of the TMs can occur. It is worth recalling that J = h 0 /h depends on the location x = (x 1 , x 2 ) of the mid plane of the bilayer. As recalled in Section 4 , it has been shown that J is the order parameter in lipid membranes (see e.g. Deseri et al., 2008; Deseri and Zurlo, 2013; Zurlo, 2006 ) , allowing for discriminating whether or not lipids exhibit ordered ( J = 1 indicates the completely straight configuration of the lipid tails) or disordered phases ( J > 1, curlier configuration). Henceforth, the resulting change in entropy due to translational changes may be written as follows: Accordingly to Eq. (C.7) and a range of geometric quantities collected from literature in Table 3 , a range for \u03ba can be then determined to be \u03ba min \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 \u03ba max , where \u03ba min = 0 . 587 , \u03ba max = 1 . 634 and \u03ba m = (\u03ba min + \u03ba max ) / 2 = 1 . 11 will be used. In Pollaci (2016) bounds for \u03b7 are found in terms of the ratio h / h 0 . Nonetheless, for a given set of geometrical parameters h 0 , d s , \u03c1 T , it can be shown that \u03b7 * = K \u22121 represents the lowest possible value for \u03b7. Maximum admissible values of the conformational changes \u03b7 can also be estimated by considering extreme configurations of a single TM. Indeed \u03b7 is composed by a rotation, \u03c9 in the range (0, \u03c0 ] (i.e. the value 0 cannot be achieved), and a shear, \u03bc = tan \u03b1 where \u03b1 is an angle across thickness (see Fig. 13 ). The angle \u03b1 can conceivably achieve values up to \u03c0 /4, due to the presence of the surrounding TMs. Then, the conformational field is found in the following interval: \u03b7 * \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 \u03c0 .",

This shows that relative thickness change H increases with an increase of active receptor density X . This result, is found to be in agreement with the experimental findings of Lefkovitz ( Lefkowitz, 2007 ) and Kobilka ( Kobilka and Deupi, 2007 ) . As in a purification process the addition of cholesterol to the membrane induces lipid ordering, this actually enhances the clustering of activated receptors on rafts. Our model is then consistent to this observation already at the constitutive level. Furthermore, in Pollaci (2016) it is shown that Eq.

A density change of active receptors drives the system towards an active configuration in which the lipid bilayer shrinks around active domains, this causing membrane deformation and thickening in the form of lipid rafts. Unlike usual description of finite deformations and multiphysics, all the three configurations are global. This is justified through a non-standard multiscale geometric framework provided by the theory of Structured Deformations (see e.g.Owen, 2003 , Deseri andOwen (2010) ,Deseri and Owen (2015) ,Deseri and  Owen(2019), Palumbo et al. (2018) ). Here, each material particle of the body in the virgin configuration (displayed in the top-left side of this figure) gets first mapped into an intermediate region (center of the figure) through a pair of smooth bijections (i , K ) (where i stands for the vector-valued identity and the tensor K accounts for all the submacroscopic changes). Indeed, it can be shown that K r = detK and, hence, this invariant of K accounts for remodelling. Secondly, each neighborhood of each particle located in this intermediate global configuration gets classically deformed through a pair (y , \u2207y ) , where y is a smooth deformation field from the intermediate global configuration onto the current one, while the second item in the pair is the deformation gradient from the intermediate global configuration. Features of Structured Deformations in connection with the examined biological systems are discussed in more details in Appendix C in which an alternative scheme of the kinematics is given in Fig. 13 .",
