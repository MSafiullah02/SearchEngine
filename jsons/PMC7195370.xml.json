It is an old observation of mine \u2013 of one who was never strong and has suffered through numerous viruses during his 70 years \u2013 that the virus \u201ctravels\u201d through the body, normally causing in turn: high fever, cough, throat pain, and then (usually the last stage) digestive-tract problems. That is, the latter problems for the coronavirus could be expected simply because it is a VIRUS. Still, there is the question of whether or not the digestive-tract problems can appear without high temperature, etc. We think that this is not very probable, though each of the problems can be dominant and thus easier for detection. If so, then the other problems might be not recorded.",

Stressing that the problem of the \u201crelease\u201d of the bacteria relates mainly to weak people (in the present case \u2013 not necessarily older people \u2013 they may be also children) \u2013 it is thus explained in Ref. [1] that antibiotics CAN also help in the case of a virus \u2013 even though it does not act DIRECTLY on the virus. Here too, there is an interesting question \u2013 WHICH bacteria can thus support the coronavirus. This question is certainly relevant to the target of developing pharmaceutical to help fight the coronavirus. THE VIRUS DOES NOT ACT ALONE!",
