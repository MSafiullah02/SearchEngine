Classified within the family Flaviviridae, it possesses an uncapped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome with structured 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) flanking a large open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein that is processed into ten viral proteins (Scheel and Rice, 2013). The 5\u2032 UTR contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that mediates cap-independent initiation of viral protein synthesis and, at its extreme 5\u2032 end, RNA signals essential for genome replication (Friebe et al., 2001, Honda et al., 1999). The 5\u2032 UTR serves as a platform for recruitment of cellular factors that are essential for viral translation and/or RNA replication, including, among others, poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), and microRNA 122 (miR-122) (Fukushi et al., 2001, Jopling et al., 2005, Kieft et al., 2001, Pestova et al., 1998, Wang et al., 2011).",

            "text": "miR-122 is a highly expressed and liver-specific small RNA that accounts for a large fraction of miRNAs in hepatocytes (Chang et al., 2004). It regulates expression of numerous liver-specific genes post-transcriptionally by binding to the 3\u2032 UTR of cellular mRNAs (Chang et al., 2004, Lanford et al., 2010). In contrast to this typical miRNA action, miR-122 binds to two conserved sites (S1 and S2) near the 5\u2032 end of the HCV 5\u2032 UTR and stimulates replication of the virus (Jangra et al., 2010, Jopling et al., 2005, Jopling et al., 2008). Mutations introduced into the S1 and S2 sites that disrupt miR-122 binding severely impair replication (Jangra et al., 2010, Jopling et al., 2005, Norman and Sarnow, 2010). However, S1 and S2 virus mutants can be rescued by transfection of modified miR-122 oligonucleotides containing complementary mutations that restore binding to the 5\u2032 UTR, indicating that miR-122 promotes HCV replication directly and not indirectly by modulating host gene expression. Silencing miR-122 by administration of a complementary locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligomer has shown therapeutic promise in preclinical and clinical studies (Janssen et al., 2013, Lanford et al., 2010), highlighting the importance of miR-122 in the virus life cycle.",

            "text": "Although well established, an understanding of how miR-122 promotes HCV replication has remained elusive. Early studies suggested that it might act, in part, by stimulating IRES-directed translation (Henke et al., 2008). Later work supports this view (Jangra et al., 2010, Roberts et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2012), but recent data suggest that increases in viral protein expression may result from an unusual stabilizing effect of miR-122 on the HCV genome (Shimakami et al., 2012a). miR-122 recruits argonaute 2 (AGO2) protein to the 5\u2032 end of the viral RNA (Conrad et al., 2013, Shimakami et al., 2012a) and protects the genome from 5\u2032 decay mediated by the cytoplasmic 5\u2032 exonuclease, Xrn1 (Li et al., 2013b). miR-122 and Xrn1 thus have competing effects on the stability and rate of decay of HCV RNA in infected cells, and Xrn1 depletion enhances both viral RNA abundance and the production of infectious virus in cell culture (Li et al., 2013b). However, while miR-122 has no effect on the stability of HCV RNA in Xrn1-depleted cells due to the absence of 5\u2032 exonuclease activity, supplementing such cells with exogenous miR-122 continues to boost HCV replication (Li et al., 2013b). Furthermore, Xrn1 depletion does not rescue replication of a viral mutant that is defective in miR-122 binding (Li et al., 2013b). These results indicate that miR-122 has an additional key function in the HCV replication cycle above and beyond its ability to physically stabilize the genome (Li et al., 2013a). Consistent with this, some miR-122 mutants protect RNA against Xrn1-mediated decay, yet fail to promote virus replication (Mortimer and Doudna, 2013).",

We show that augmenting endogenous miR-122 abundance stimulates viral RNA synthesis under conditions of Xrn1 depletion in which miR-122 has no effect on viral RNA stability. While we find translation and replication of the viral RNA are tightly coupled processes, miR-122-mediated increases in RNA synthesis temporally precede increases in viral protein synthesis. Surprisingly, however, miR-122 does not stimulate viral RNA synthesis in the absence of active protein translation or following RNAi-mediated depletion of PCBP2. Our results indicate that the primary function of miR-122 is to enhance HCV RNA synthesis, and suggest a mechanism by which miR-122 alters the balance of viral genomes engaged in genome synthesis versus protein translation.",

We thus compared the kinetics of miR-122-mediated increases in the abundance of viral RNA and viral proteins in HCV-infected cells in an effort to determine whether one precedes the other and thus might represent a primary effect of miR-122. We supplemented the endogenous abundance of miR-122 in HJ3\u20135 virus-infected cells by transfecting synthetic duplex miR-122 or, as a control, a brain-specific miRNA, miR-124 (see Experimental Procedures). Because miR-122 stabilizes genomic RNA by protecting it from Xrn1-mediated decay (Li et al., 2013b), we examined the kinetics of HCV RNA and protein accumulation both with and without prior siRNA-mediated depletion of Xrn1 (Figure 1\nA). Xrn2, a predominantly nuclear 5\u2032 exonuclease, has also been suggested to mediate HCV RNA decay (Sedano and Sarnow, 2014). However, we found that Xrn2 depletion has no effect on the decay of HJ3\u20135 RNA, whereas Xrn1 depletion significantly slows it (Figures S1A\u2013S1D). Moreover, we confirmed that miR-122 supplementation has only a minimal, non-significant effect on RNA decay in Xrn1-depleted cells (Figures S1E and S1F) (Li et al., 2013b). Nonetheless, miR-122 supplementation mediated significant increases in viral RNA abundance and NS5A protein expression in both Xrn1-depleted cells as well as in cells transfected with a non-targeting siRNA, siCtrl (Li et al., 2013b) (Figure 1). As expected (Li et al., 2013b), these increases were greater in siCtrl- than in siXrn1-transfected cells (Figure 1). In multiple experiments, increases in viral RNA and NS5A abundance occurred with a similar kinetic and were significant within 6\u20139 hr following transfection of miR-122 (Figures 1C and 1E). These results demonstrate very close coupling between increases in viral RNA synthesis and protein expression, but do not reveal which is the primary target of miR-122.",

After confirming Xrn1 depletion (Figure 2B), cells were labeled with either 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) or [35S]-methionine/cysteine following transfection with miR-122 or the control miR-124. Nascent viral RNA was measured by qRT-PCR following pull-down of biotin-conjugated, EU-labeled RNA (see Experimental Procedures). We used HJ3\u20135/NS5AYFP virus for these experiments as it expresses NS5A with an internal yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion, allowing measurement of nascent protein synthesis by immunoprecipitation of [35S]-labeled NS5A-YFP with anti-YFP antibody followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimager analysis (Figure 2C). Remarkably, we observed a reproducible increase in nascent viral RNA synthesis within 1 hr in cells transfected with miR-122 versus miR-124, whereas there was no measurable increase (and in fact a slight, but significant, decrease) in NS5A-YFP synthesis during this period (Figure 2D; p < 0.01 by two-sided Mann-Whitney test). Increased NS5A-YFP synthesis was observed at later time points, likely because of increases in viral RNA available for translation. Since the t1/2 of replicating HJ3\u20135 RNA is approximately 8.3\u20139.6 hr in Xrn1-depleted cells (Figure S1F), the increase in viral RNA synthesis at 1 hr cannot be explained by enhanced RNA stability. Moreover, while miR-122 appeared to protect newly synthesized RNA from degradation, this effect was not observed in Xrn1-depleted cells (Figure S2). Collectively, these data provide strong evidence that miR-122 directly promotes HCV RNA synthesis, and confirm close coupling between viral RNA and protein synthesis.",

To determine whether AGO2 is also required for miR-122 stimulation of viral RNA synthesis, we transfected cells with AGO2-specific siRNA prior to miR-122 supplementation (Figure 2E).

HCV RNA synthesis was reduced to background levels by the NS5B inhibitors (Figure 4C, left), supporting the specificity of this assay. Total HCV RNA was reduced, but still abundant, in the cells (\u223c5 \u00d7 107 copies/\u03bcg total RNA) at the end of the 12-hr labeling period (Figure 4C, right), and there was no difference in its abundance in cells supplemented with miR-122 versus those transfected with miR-124. This further confirms that miR-122 does not have a stabilizing effect on HCV RNA in Xrn-1 depleted cells (Li et al., 2013b). The amount of newly synthesized [35S]-labeled NS5A-YFP protein was also reduced by the polymerase inhibitors due to the reduction in RNA template available for translation (Figure 4D).

            "text": "While translation of an incoming positive-strand RNA virus genome is necessary to establish replication complexes and initiate viral RNA synthesis in newly infected cells, prior studies indicate that continued protein translation is not required for ongoing HCV or flaviviral RNA synthesis (Shi et al., 2003, Westaway et al., 1999). This suggests that essential replicase components are either recycled for new rounds of viral RNA synthesis, or are present in excess abundance. To determine whether miR-122 would induce increases in RNA synthesis in the absence of ongoing translation, we treated infected Xrn1-depleted cells with puromycin or cycloheximide (CHX) (Figures 5\nA and 5B). Both inhibitors caused a complete or near-complete inhibition of viral and cellular protein synthesis without a noticeable effect on total cellular protein abundance over the 5 hr course of the experiment (Figure 5C). Surprisingly, short-term treatment (3\u20135 hr) with puromycin increased nascent viral RNA synthesis as much as or more than miR-122 supplementation in the absence of puromycin (Figure 5D). In contrast, there was no increase in nascent viral RNA synthesis after 4-hr treatment with CHX (Figure 5E). This difference is likely due to puromycin-induced dissociation of translating ribosomes from viral RNA, as this would lead to increased availability of viral RNA templates for RNA synthesis as observed in vitro with poliovirus (Barton et al., 1999). In contrast, CHX freezes ribosomes and prevents their clearance from RNA.",

The lack of miR-122 stimulation of RNA synthesis was not related to insufficient AGO2, as AGO2 abundance was minimally reduced after 5 hr of translational shutoff (Figures S3A and S3B). Moreover, although reduced from untreated cells, miR-122 supplementation substantially increased the quantity of miR-122 that co-immunoprecipitated with AGO2 from lysates of puromycin-treated cells (Figure S3C). Lengthier shutdown of protein synthesis (12\u201315 hr), exceeding the estimated half-lives of nonstructural HCV proteins (Pietschmann et al., 2001), significantly decreased viral RNA synthesis in Xrn1-depleted cells and similarly eliminated any enhancement of nascent viral RNA synthesis by miR-122 (Figure S4). Collectively, these results confirm earlier reports that continuing protein translation is not required for HCV RNA synthesis as long as there is a sufficient abundance of the requisite nonstructural proteins (Shi et al., 2003, Westaway et al., 1999). In contrast, active protein translation is required for miR-122 to stimulate HCV RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "Since puromycin treatment and miR-122 supplementation caused similar, non-additive increases in HCV RNA synthesis (Figure 5D), we considered the possibility of a common underlying mechanism. Puromycin increases poliovirus RNA synthesis in cell-free replication reactions by clearing ribosomes from viral RNA, thereby providing more template for RNA synthesis (Barton et al., 1999). A partial inhibition of HCV translation initiation by miR-122 could have a similar impact on viral RNA synthesis. To assess this possibility, we analyzed the distribution of HCV RNA in rate-zonal gradients loaded with polysomes isolated from infected cells 1\u20132 hr after transfection with miR-122 or the control miR-124 (Figures 6\nand S5). As anticipated, miR-122 induced a decrease in the proportion of HCV RNA associating with polysomes engaged in translation (Figure 6A, fractions 11\u201313) and an increase in less translationally active RNA co-sedimenting with 80S ribosomes (fractions 7\u20139) (Figure 6A). These changes were less than those observed with puromycin (Figure 6B), but they were reproducible and statistically significant (p < 0.005). In contrast, no changes were evident in \u03b2-actin mRNA distribution. Substantially smaller changes occurred in the distribution of chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) and cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) mRNAs within an hour of transfecting miR-122, both natural targets of the miRNA (Figure 6C). We conclude from these results that miR-122 induces an immediate rebalancing of the proportion of viral RNA engaged in translation versus that templating new viral RNA synthesis. By 2 hr, the increase in newly synthesized RNA results in a net increase in viral protein synthesis (Figure 2D), although the redistribution of HCV RNA persists (Figure S6).",

            "text": "In addition to miR-122/AGO2, several cellular proteins, including the heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear proteins PCBP2 (hnRNP E2) and hnRNP L, bind to the 5\u2032 end of the HCV genome and facilitate its replication (Fukushi et al., 2001, Li et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2011). PCBP2 is of particular interest, as it regulates the IRES-initiated translation of poliovirus, another positive-strand RNA virus, and facilitates both circularization and translation of the HCV genome (Perera et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2011). Recent studies in our laboratory also show that PCBP2 competes with miR-122 for binding to synthetic RNA representing the 5\u2032 47 nts of HCV (Li et al., 2014) (Figure 7\nA). In similar pull-down experiments, we found that a two-base change (nts 41\u201342) within the S2 binding site of miR-122 ablated PCBP2, but not hnRNP L, binding (Figure 7B). This confirms that a major PCBP2 binding site overlaps one of the two functional miR-122 binding sites, suggesting in turn that miR-122 might skew the engagement of viral RNA molecules away from translation toward RNA synthesis by competing with and displacing PCBP2. Were this the case, we reasoned that miR-122 supplementation would have little if any positive effect on HCV RNA synthesis in cells depleted of PCBP2. To test this hypothesis, we depleted stably infected cells of PCBP2 by two successive transfections of PCBP2-specific siRNA (Figures 7C and 7D). This resulted in modest reductions in NS5A-YFP and HCV RNA abundance 48 hr after the second siRNA transfection (83% \u00b1 7% and 80% \u00b1 4% of siCtrl-transfected cells, p = 0.12 and p < 0.01, respectively) (Figures 7D and 7E). After transfecting the cells with miR-124 or miR-122, we assessed nascent NS5A-YFP and HCV RNA synthesis using the methods described above. In cells supplemented with the control miRNA, miR-124, prior PCBP2 depletion reduced NS5A-YFP synthesis to 82% \u00b1 2% of that in control cells (Figures 7F and 7G; p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no reduction in viral RNA synthesis (103% \u00b1 4%) (Figure 7H). This suggests that PCBP2 depletion either increased the efficiency of RNA synthesis or proportion of HCV RNAs engaged in viral RNA synthesis. Furthermore, as anticipated, miR-122 supplementation did not stimulate either viral protein or viral RNA synthesis in PCBP2-depleted cells (Figures 7F\u20137H). We conclude that miR-122 promotes new viral RNA synthesis, at least in part, by displacing PCBP2 from the viral RNA, decreasing the fraction of viral RNAs engaged in translation and proportionally increasing the fraction available to template viral RNA synthesis.",

Our previous work indicates that the binding of miR-122 to two sites near the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome stabilizes the RNA and protects it within infected cells from 5\u2032 Xrn1-mediated decay (Li et al., 2013b, Shimakami et al., 2012a). Although a recent report suggested that Xrn2, a predominantly nuclear 5\u2032 exonuclease, mediates HCV RNA decay (Sedano and Sarnow, 2014), we were unable to demonstrate this experimentally (Figure S1D). Importantly, we confirmed that miR-122 no longer influences the stability of HJ3\u20135 RNA in Xrn1-depleted cells (Figure S1F). Moreover, miR-122 supplementation increased the abundance of previously synthesized nascent RNA detected in control cells, but not in Xrn1-depleted cells (Figure S2). Collectively, these data provide strong justification for our use of Xrn1-depleted cells in the experiments described here.",

By developing methods allowing a direct comparison of the influence of miR-122 on viral RNA synthesis versus the synthesis of an essential viral nonstructural protein, NS5A, we have been able to show that transfection of duplex miR-122 induces significant increases in viral RNA synthesis in Xrn1-depleted cells prior to any increase in viral protein synthesis (Figure 2D). These data provide strong evidence that miR-122 acts to directly promote HCV RNA synthesis, and that this leads to secondary increases in viral protein synthesis with subsequent expansion of viral replication complexes.",

With some positive-strand RNA viruses, continued protein translation is required for ongoing synthesis of viral RNAs. For example, poliovirus RNA synthesis is dependent on translational activity of the viral RNA (Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994), and continuous protein synthesis is required for RNA synthesis by the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (Hagemeijer et al., 2012, Shi et al., 1999). Previous data suggest this is not the case for flaviviruses, including HCV (Shi et al., 2003, Westaway et al., 1999). We confirm this here (Figure 5D). Surprisingly, however, our results show that active protein translation is required for miR-122 to stimulate nascent HCV RNA synthesis.",

Since the genomes of these viruses serve as template for both translation and RNA synthesis, there is a conflict inherent in the 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 movement of translating ribosomes and the 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 translocation of the RdRp during negative-strand synthesis (Gamarnik and Andino, 1998). In the case of poliovirus, translation dominates until the viral protease becomes sufficiently abundant to cleave PCBP2, which binds the 5\u2032 end of poliovirus RNA and in its intact form promotes IRES-directed translation (Perera et al., 2007). How HCV regulates the engagement of genomes in translation versus RNA synthesis is not known, but it is unlikely to utilize such an \u201con-off\u201d switch due to the need to maintain continuous low-level replication in persistently infected hepatocytes. Puromycin acts to release translating ribosomes from messenger RNAs, thereby terminating translation. Similar to previous in vitro studies of poliovirus replication (Barton et al., 1999), puromycin-induced release of ribosomes from HCV RNA correlated in the short term with increased viral RNA synthesis (Figure 5D). In effect, puromycin induces an artificial switch from translation to replication.",

            "text": "miR-122 appears to act in a fashion similar to puromycin, facilitating a shift in the balance of HCV genomes engaged in translation versus RNA synthesis. The polysome analysis in Figure 6A shows that miR-122-induced increases in viral RNA synthesis are associated with a reproducible shift of viral RNAs from polysomes to the monosome fraction. This explains why miR-122 has no effect on RNA synthesis in the presence of puromycin, when all ribosomes have been released from the RNA, or following CHX treatment, when they are frozen in place. The miR-122 effect is only partial; substantial HCV RNA remains bound to polysomes and continues to be translated in the presence of miR-122 (Li et al., 2013a). However, miR-122 increases the fraction of RNA genomes available to template new RNA synthesis. It seems likely that miR-122 accomplishes this, at least in part, by displacing PCBP2 from the viral RNA (Figure 7) (Li et al., 2014). This may reduce the cyclization state of the viral RNA (Wang et al., 2011), potentially freeing 3\u2032 UTR sequences for interactions with the replicase. Additional mechanisms may also be involved, including changes in the tertiary structure of the viral IRES (Mortimer and Doudna, 2013). The AGO2 complex recruited to HCV RNA by miR-122 could also function to reduce translation, as miRNA-induced silencing complexes normally do. Further efforts will be required to answer these questions, and to learn whether miR-122 promotes negative-strand or positive-strand viral RNA synthesis. However, the data presented here reveal a mechanism by which a miRNA regulates replication of a positive-strand virus by modulating the binding of cellular proteins to the viral RNA and controlling the balance between engagement of the RNA in protein translation versus viral RNA synthesis.",
