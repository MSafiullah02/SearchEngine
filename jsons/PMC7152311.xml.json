            "text": "The concept of receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins arose in the 1960s to explain cell-mediated biological activities of antibodies. \u2018Opsonins\u2019 indeed enabled antigen to enter phagocytic cells (Berken and Benacerraf, 1966); \u2018cytophilic\u2019 antibodies sensitized tissues that released histamine upon antigen challenge (Bloch, 1967); distinct classes of antibodies differentially regulated secondary antibody responses (Henry and Jerne, 1968). These biological effects requiring the Fc portion of antibodies, the name \u2018Fc receptor\u2019 (FcR) was coined (Paraskevas et al., 1972). FcRs for various antibody classes were identified as binding sites on a variety of cells (Vaughan and Boyden, 1964; Kulczycki and Metzger, 1974; Unkeless et al., 1988). FcRs were characterized functionally and biochemically (Holowka et al., 1980; Ernst et al., 1993; Pfefferkorn and Yeaman, 1994). Murine and human cDNAs encoding FcRs were cloned, sequenced, and expressed by transfection (Ravetch and Kinet, 1991); corresponding genes were located on chromosomes and their exon/intron organization was elucidated (Qiu et al., 1990). The extracellular domains of FcRs were recognized as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) (Williams and Barclay, 1988); amino acid sequences enabling them to interact with antibodies, extracellularly (Hulett and Hogarth, 1994), and to signal, intracellularly (Da\u00ebron, 1997), were dissected; the 3D-structure of their extracellular domains in complex with immunoglobulin Fc portions was solved (Garman et al., 1998; Maxwell et al., 1999). Finally, a collection of genetically modified FcR knock out (KO), knock in (KI), and transgenic mice was generated that enabled FcR functions to be delineated in vivo (Smith et al., 2012). FcRs thus appeared as a family of functionally, structurally, and genetically related molecules that play major roles in antibody-dependent processes in physiology, in pathology, and, with the advent of passive immunotherapy, in therapeutics.",

            "text": "Genes encoding FcR-related molecules were unexpectedly discovered, clustered with human FCR genes (according to the usual typographic convention, protein names are in roman type, whereas gene names are in italics; names of human genes are in upper case, whereas names of murine genes are in lower case), in the early 1990s (Imboden et al., 1989; Seaman et al., 1991). Similar genes were found in the same clusters as mouse fcr genes (Figure 1\n). A whole family of putative Fc receptor-like molecules (FcRLs \u2013 the abbreviation \u2018FcRL\u2019 is used instead of \u2018FCRL\u2019 for consistency with \u2018FcR\u2019) thus emerged (Davis et al., 2001; Hatzivassiliou et al., 2001), whose existence was progressively confirmed (Li et al., 2014). As FcRLs originated from genetic studies, much less is known of their biological functions, compared to FcRs. A syntenic chromosomal linkage, a similar genetic organization, a common membership of the IgSF suggest that FcRLs may be functionally related to FcRs. Supporting this assumption, both FcRs and FcRLs possess immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), like B cell and T cell receptors (BCR and TCR) for antigen (Reth, 1989), and/or immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs), like inhibitory receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) cells (Vivier and Da\u00ebron, 1997). FcRs and FcRLs therefore belong to the immunoreceptor family. Differences in their structure, ligands, and pattern of expression, however, indicate that FcRs and FcRLs play distinct, complementary roles.",

Genes that encode classical hFcRs are within the FCR locus on chromosome 1, whereas the FCAR1 gene is in the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) locus on chromosome 19 (Akula et al., 2014). The LRC locus contains genes that encode the natural killer receptors (KIRs), the leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRs), and the leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptors (LAIRs), with which Fc\u03b1RI shows a higher sequence homology than with classical FcRs. FCER2, the gene that encodes hFc\u03b5RII, is also located on chromosome 19. Noticeably, genes encoding signaling homodimers shared by FcRs, NK receptors, and T cell receptors also lie in the same two loci. Genes encoding FcR\u03b3 and TCR\u03be are in the FCR locus, whereas genes encoding DAP10 and DAP12 are in the LRC locus. FcRn stands for neonatal FcR because this IgG receptor was first observed in newborn mice. FcRn is related neither structurally nor genetically with classical FcRs. It is an MHC class I molecule encoded by a gene of the MHC complex on chromosome 6 (Ghetie and Ward, 2000).",

Genes encoding the IgA/IgM poly-immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), FcRLs, and FcR\u03b3 appeared first within the fcr locus, as well as genes homologous to mammalian genes of the LRC locus in early bony fishes. Noticeably, genes encoding FcRLs were the ancestors of genes encoding FcRs for IgG (Fc\u03b3RI, II, III, and IV) and IgE (Fc\u03b5RI), while duplicated sequences from the pigr gene provided sequences for genes encoding receptors for IgA/IgM (Fc\u03b1\u03bcR) and for IgM (Fc\u03bcR) during early mammalian evolution (Akula et al., 2014).

Multichain FcRs are composed of a specific immunoglobulin-binding subunit named FcR\u03b1 and one or two common subunits. FcR\u03b3 is a disulfide-bonded homodimer shared by most multichain FcRs (Orloff et al., 1990). FcR\u03b2 is a tetraspanin that associates with multichain FcRs in mast cells and basophils (Kurosaki et al., 1992). Like other MHC-I molecules, FcRn associates with \u03b2-2 microglobulin (Israel et al., 1995). FcR\u03b3 and \u03b2-2 microglobulin are mandatory for the expression of multichain FcRs and FcRn, respectively. FcR\u03b2 is mandatory for the expression of Fc\u03b5RI in mice. All FcRLs are single-chain receptors. They comprise six transmembrane molecules in humans (hFcRL1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and three in mice (mFcRL1, 5, 6), two intracellular molecules (FcRLA and B) in both species, and one soluble molecule (mFcRLs) in mice (Li et al., 2014).",

It is characterized by an affinity constant (Ka), calculated by dividing the association constant by the dissociation constant. The affinity constant is a characteristic of FcRs. One distinguishes two classes of FcRs. High-affinity FcRs have a Ka between 107 and 1010\n M\u2212\n1 (Kulczycki and Metzger, 1974; Unkeless and Eisen, 1975). They can bind immunoglobulins as monomers, that is, not in complex with antigen. Low-affinity FcRs have a Ka between 105 and 107\n M\u2212\n1 (Bruhns et al., 2009). They cannot bind monomeric immunoglobulins. Both high- and low-affinity FcRs, however, bind immune complexes with a high avidity. A proportion of high-affinity FcRs are occupied in vivo, whereas low-affinity FcRs are not in spite of the high concentration of circulating immunoglobulins. They are therefore available for binding immune complexes. Occupied high-affinity FcRs, however, can be freed as bound antibodies dissociate (Mancardi et al., 2008). The dissociation constant therefore critically determines the availability of high-affinity FcRs.",

The two types of ligands identified are immunoglobulins and MHC molecules. Only hFcRLs were found to have an affinity for immunoglobulins. hFcRL4 binds heat-aggregated IgA, and hFcRL5 binds IgG of the different subclasses (Li et al., 2014). Noticeably, IgG binds to hFcRL5 and to hFc\u03b3Rs by different mechanisms. Binding indeed requires not only the Fc portion, but also the F(ab')2 moiety of intact IgG through two independent binding events. Like binding to FcRs, binding to hFcRL5 requires glycosylated IgG (Franco et al., 2013). Although intracellular, hFcRLA was also reported to have an affinity for IgA, IgM, and IgG. One human and one murine FcRL interact with MHC molecules. hFcRL6 has an affinity for MHC class II molecules and this affinity varies with the MHC-II haplotype (Schreeder et al., 2010). mFcRL5 has an affinity for an MHC-related viral protein. This MHC class I\u2013like molecule encoded by the cowpox virus also binds to NKG2D on NK cells (Campbell et al., 2010).",

These, indeed, generate a mixture of positive and negative signals (Malbec et al., 2004), the dominant effect of which is activation under physiological conditions. Under other conditions, though, such as an excess of antigen that leads to a hyperaggregation of FcRs, negative signals overcome positive signals and, paradoxically, activating FcRs prevent cell activation (Gimborn et al., 2005).",

Different FcRs are coaggregated when IgG immune complexes interact with cells that coexpress different Fc\u03b3Rs or when pluri-isotypic immune complexes bind to cells that coexpress FcRs for several classes of antibodies. Even when cells express one type of FcR only (e.g., Fc\u03b3RIIB in murine B cells or Fc\u03b3RIIIA in murine NK cells), immune complexes can coengage FcRs with other immunoreceptors (BCR in B cells or NKR on NK cells). Heteroaggregation, that is, the coaggregation of different types of FcR or the coaggregation of FcRs with other immunoreceptors, is actually a rule, rather than an exception, under physiological conditions. Because there are FcRs for all antibody classes, because immune complexes contain more than one class of antibody, and because most cells express more than one type of FcR, various combinations of FcRs can be engaged at the cell surface to form heteroaggregates with a nonpredetermined composition. FcRs can thus generate a variety of signaling complexes, depending on the relative proportion of ITAM-containing and ITIM-containing receptors that are coengaged by immune complexes on any given cell (Da\u00ebron, 2014).",

The engagement of the two-ITIM- and one-ITAM-containing hFcRL2, hFcRL5, and mFcRL5 generates a mixture of effects, the dominant effect of which is inhibition. Although it contains both activation and inhibition motifs, hFcRL5 does not signal upon aggregation. It requires to be coengaged with activating receptors for triggering negative signals. When hFcRL5 is coligated with BCR, the N-terminal hFcRL5 ITAM recruits the src kinase Lyn, which phosphorylates the ITIM, which in turn recruits the tyrosine phosphatase(s) SHP-1/2, which inhibits BCR signaling (Zhu et al., 2013). Unlike hFcRL5, when expressed in Ramos B cells, the two-ITIM-containing hFcRL4 was constitutively phosphorylated and associated with SHP-1/2, suggesting that it could exert a constitutive negative effect (Sohn et al., 2011).",

Immune responses being pluri-isotypic and cells of different types sharing FcRs for the same isotypes, antibodies select heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous cell populations, when in complex with antigen. These populations comprise a mixture of FcR-expressing cells that are present, were recruited, and/or proliferated locally.

Activation signals generated by the two ITAM-containing human and murine FcRL1 stimulate B cell proliferation, like signals generated by the BCR. Conversely, the ITAM + ITIM-containing FcRL2\u20135 generally negatively regulate BCR signaling. However, when coligated with BCR, FcRL3 inhibited activation signals, whereas it enhanced B cell activation, proliferation, and survival when coligated with TLR9 (Li et al., 2013). Likewise, the constitutive negative regulation of BCR signaling by FcRL4 was accompanied by a positive regulation of TLR9 signaling (Sohn et al., 2011). Noticeably, while enhancing proliferation, the coligation of FcRL3 and TLR9 inhibited plasma cell differentiation and antibody production (Li et al., 2014). When coengaged with BCR, mFcRL5 had antagonistic effects on Ca2+ responses and on MAPK activation, which differentially controlled BCR-dependent signals in B1 B cells and in marginal zone B cells (Zhu et al., 2013). These results altogether indicate that FcRLs which contain both ITAMs and ITIMs can differentially regulate (1) BCR- and TLR-dependent, that is, adaptive and innate signals, (2) activation versus proliferation and differentiation signals, and (3) B cell subsets.",

Fc\u03b5RI-deficient mice are resistant to IgE-induced passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA) (Dombrowicz et al., 1993); hIgE induce PSA in hFc\u03b5RI-expressing transgenic mice (Dombrowicz et al., 1996; Fung-Leung et al., 1996). IgG1 antibodies can also trigger passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) when engaging mFc\u03b3RIIIA (Hazenbos et al., 1996), and Fc\u03b3RIV expressed by neutrophils accounted for active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA), together with Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Jonsson et al., 2011). Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice display enhanced anaphylaxis (Takai et al., 1996; Ujike et al., 1999). Both hFc\u03b3RI and hFc\u03b3RIIA triggered IgG-induced PSA and ASA in transgenic mice (Jonsson et al., 2012; Mancardi et al., 2013). Human mast cell Fc\u03b3RIIA account for IgG-induced PCA (Zhao et al., 2006). When coengaged on human basophils, Fc\u03b3RIIA and Fc\u03b3RIIB inhibit cell activation. Consequently, basophils failed to be activated by IgG immune complexes, and IgG immune complexes that coengaged Fc\u03b3Rs with Fc\u03b5RI inhibited IgE-dependent basophil activation (Cassard et al., 2012).",

Antimyelin antibodies found in multiple sclerosis and anti-dopaminergic neurons antibodies found in Parkinson disease (McRae-Degueurce et al., 1988) are thought to activate FcR-expressing phagocytic cells.
