The widespread adaptation of larger boar studs increased the number of farms that could be affected with introduction of an infectious disease that can spread through semen. Biosecurity measures to prevent PRRS (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome) virus transfer among farms has largely influenced the biosecurity practices of boar studs in North America and worldwide.",

Widespread eradication of PRRS virus from boar multiplication in the period of 1999\u20132001 was followed by eradications from boar studs. Subsequent PRRS virus introductions into na\u00efve boar studs and spread to sow farms resulted in a demand from the industry to address this risk. During that same time, biosecurity practices and recommendations were published based on scientific studies [1], and boar studs in North America were quick to adopt these principals. However, continued virus introductions along with anecdotal evidence from the field led producers and practitioners to be concerned about aerosol transmission, and interest in air filtration for boar studs increased to prevent PRRS virus introduction. A study tracking treatment and control farms showed reduced viral transmission events when comparing filtered to cohort non-filtered farms over the course of several years [2]. Data compiled from 93 filtered herds, showed a reduced number of breaks when farms were filtered [3]. Air filtration has been an important aspect of biosecurity, and its implementation into the design of boar studs worldwide is recommended. Since the adaptation of air filtration in boar studs, the introduction of PRRS virus has become a rare event [4].",

The movement of people and pigs is certainly different now from that in the past, and this has led to widespread concern about diseases such as ASF (African Swine Fever) virus spreading to free areas, leading not only to animal suffering, but also to political and economic impacts. ASF virus has been shown to be shed in semen [7]. Depending on country or region, there are other viruses like (CSF) Classical Swine Fever [8,9] and FMD (Foot and Mouth disease) [10], that also shed in semen. The same model that has been successfully implemented for PRRS virus could also be implemented for these diseases. A major challenge is the testing component for countries free of a disease. Same day turn around is generally not available. An additional challenge is who would pay for testing each production day. It is difficult for diagnostic labs to justify same day results. With two recent examples disease outbreaks in North America (Seneca Virus A and PED), preventative testing was available initially, and only later routinely run by the labs. These issues increase the chances that a boar stud could disseminate infectious disease as it emerges.",

To prevent downstream infection, early identification is critical. Studies need to focus on the first few days after virus introduction. For some diseases, clinical signs appear at the same time or even after viral shedding has commenced [[11], [12], [13]].

Withholding semen for a day after collection allows boar stud staff to observe animals for clinical signs and if present, stop the use of potentially infected semen until further testing can be done. The incubation time, duration from infection to shedding, and routes of shedding during the first few days after exposure, are important to the prioritization of protocols to prevent downstream infections. Early detection of clinical signs, frequent testing, and withholding semen for use are effective, but not foolproof strategies to prevent downstream transmission. When tests are available, such as with PRRS virus, there is little value in testing unless semen is withheld until negative results are obtained.",

Samples should be submitted to a diagnostic laboratory the same day and a quick turn-around time on test results is critical. Testing boars and holding samples until it is convenient, or delayed turn-around times at the diagnostic lab, can result in boars reaching peak shedding levels of virus before test result confirmation and delay the ability of the staff to remove boars prior to having high levels of virus shedding into the quarantine environment. Additional testing is normally done which should include antibody testing (for example ELISA) 14\u201328 days after arrival. I normally recommend additional testing at that time, for diseases such as Aujeszky's Disease, Brucella suis, and Seneca Virus A.

A second outer perimeter fence is encouraged to further reduce the entry of people, vehicles, and animals. Most important is the establishment of physical barriers. Whenever footwear or vehicles can be left behind, and a clear physical barrier crossed, there should be less contamination on the clean side compared to the dirty side. When crossing these barriers through a gate or entrance, the incorporation of physical barriers provides a separation point at which footwear can be changed, potential fomites left in quarantine, and other measures of control implemented to reduce the chance of introducing new disease to the boar or lab facility.",

Clothes must be removed and stay on the outside of the shower. Once in the shower, staff cannot move to the outside anteroom without re-showering. The shower should be kept clean to reduce the harboring of viruses and bacteria. Routine use of cleaning agents to remove biofilms will reduce the amount of bacteria or viruses that can harbor in the shower itself. Not only could bacteria or viruses enter that could contaminant the boars, the lab can be contaminated with bacteria and enter the semen production flow and cause problems with the final semen doses. When showering upon exit, towels and all internal clothing must remain on the farm side. Eliminate or minimize the use of mats in the shower or shower room as moisture can be retained and thus bacteria or viruses.",

            "text": "Despite the incorporation of the previous biosecurity procedures, some boar studs have still become infected with disease such as PRRS virus. Anecdotal evidence from testing and sequencing of neighboring farms, and evaluating wind and temperature conditions, suggests that aerosol transmission can be a significant risk to boar studs. Air filtration can be an effective way to prevent aerosol transmission of important swine viral diseases that can spread from the boars through the semen and infect sow farms. An evaluation by this author involved the filtration of 93 farms which were infected with a new strain of PRRS an average of 52.5% per year for the five years prior to filtration. After filtration, the break rate per year was 11.3%. The average number of years between PRRS breaks before filtration was 1.9 and the average after filtration was 8.9 years (P < .0001). Ninty of the 93 farms have had fewer breaks after filtration than before [3]. More specifically, 25 boar studs that implemented an air filtration system, with no other biosecurity changes, had two breaks after filtration (1.0% per year) compared to 15 breaks (14.4% per year) prior to filtration [4]. Furthermore, none of the 15 boar studs have been infected in the period of 2015\u20132018. The addition of positive pressure to the filtration system further reduces the chance of leaks and the entry of unfiltered air to the facility during boar entries, boar exits, dead boar removal, or the entry and exit of people. Filtering the air reduces viral concentrations in the barn [21]. Filter efficiency, bypass air, and concentration of virus in the region are also an important factors [22]. A filtration system reduces the number of virus particles an animal is exposed to over a period of time. The typical costs of an air filtration ($250 US dollars per boar in the US) have been shown to provide a positive net present value [23,24].",

Keeping the room at a minimum standard room temperature of 20\u00b0 Celsius, will allow one to find literature references for survival time for most of the infectious diseases. Supplies should be inspected to ensure they are clean and dry and should be placed in the quarantine and not touched for a set down time (36\u201348 h). During that time, no other supplies can be placed in quarantine and nothing can be removed. An additional step, that can add non-contact time, is to remove supplies from their transport or shipping container without touching the inner contents. Container surfaces encountering PRRS virus or PED virus may harbor live virus that could enter the farm with the container [25,26]. For example, vaccines can be removed from the cardboard box while wearing a vinyl glove and placed in quarantine. A refrigerator in the quarantine allows for down time of refrigerated items. Upon meeting the quarantine requirements, all supplies must exit into the farm and the supply quarantine must operate in an all-in, all-out fashion to prevent cross contamination of cleared supplies with newly entered supplies. Ultraviolet light systems also are available to sanitize the surface of incoming supplies and personal items.",

A reasonable example recommended in the field by the author, is to spray the back of the trailer and the loadout door with a glutaraldehyde disinfectant, combined with windshield washer fluid in the winter, and then wait 20 min before loading or unloading boars [32].
