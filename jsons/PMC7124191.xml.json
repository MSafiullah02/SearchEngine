On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin, all linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. This market harboured a variety of live and deceased exotic wildlife, including live bamboo rats, palm civets, badgers, and wolf cubs. It is notable that a quarter of the initially reported 27 pneumonia cases presented with severe disease.4, 5 Within days, the cause of the pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).2 On January 19, 2020 the WHO issued a warning that the virus may have the ability to spread from human to human.3\n",

On a typical day, approximately 3500 people take flights to other countries from Wuhan, and the number increases with holidays and the Chinese Lunar New Year. Within 1 month, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose to more than 9000, surpassing the number of SARS and MERS cases reported to date. Similarly, global fears escalated as cases spread to other countries. Extensive control measures were put into place, starting with massive decontamination efforts and, ultimately, closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, banning the trade of wildlife and poultry in wet markets, contact tracing of cases, exit screening at airports, lockdown and quarantine measures that progressed to include adjacent cities (an estimated 50\u201360 million people affected), school closures, extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, prohibition of mass gatherings, and building of two new hospitals (1000 and 1600 beds) to care for infected individuals. Other nations instituted airport screening, travel bans, and evacuating citizens from Hubei Province and quarantining them through the incubation period.6 Despite these measures, the case counts continued to increase in the outbreak epicenter, and countries with imported cases reported clusters of human-to-human transmission. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared a PHEIC, calling for intensified international collaborative efforts to halt the outbreak.3 Although Chinese authorities have heavily restricted movement from Wuhan, this austere measure came at the same time as the Spring Festival, a time when the number of outbound travellers from Wuhan is estimated to be more than 15 million.",

To date, seven human coronaviruses have been identified (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2).7 The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus and most closely resembles a bat coronavirus, with which it shares 96.2% genetic sequence homology.2, 8, 9 The current belief is that COVID-19 was introduced into humans through an as yet unidentified intermediary animal, and it has since propagated through human-to-human spread. Human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through respiratory droplets that travel up to 2 m and may enter the respiratory tract of individuals within range or contaminated surfaces, leading to infection through contact transmission.10 The average incubation period is 5 days, but it ranges from 1 to 14 days.10, 11 The basic reproductive number (the number of cases one infected individual generates), R\n0, is estimated to be 2.68 (95% confidence interval: 2.47\u20132.86).12 Whilst asymptomatic transmission (during the incubation period, before onset of symptoms in infected individuals) has been suggested, it remains controversial and currently does not appear to be a major factor for infection transmission.10\n",

If manual ventilation is anticipated, small tidal volumes should be applied.(v)Awake fibreoptic intubation should be avoided unless specifically indicated, as the atomised local anaesthetic and the coughing episode during anaesthetising of the airway can aerosolise the virus. Consider the use of a videolaryngoscopy.(vi)Tracheal intubation rather than the use of laryngeal mask is favoured.(vii)In managing patients with respiratory distress from coronavirus infection outside the operating theatre, non-invasive ventilation should be avoided, if possible, to prevent generation of aerosol of virus in the room, and early intubation should be considered in a rapidly deteriorating patient. Whilst resuscitating the critically ill patient, chest compressions should be held during intubation to avoid exposing the face of the intubating clinician to aerosols, and neuromuscular blockers should be considered before intubation, if possible.\n",
