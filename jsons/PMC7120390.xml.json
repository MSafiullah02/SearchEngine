            "text": "\nTurkey coronavirus (TCoV) causes atrophic enteritis in turkeys and outbreaks or cases of turkey coronaviral enteritis occurred and still occurs in the USA [1], Canada [2], Brazil [3], and Europe [4]. TCoV belongs to species coronavirus of the genus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. The genome of TCoV is a linear positive-sense single-stranded RNA encoding three major structural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The amino terminal region of S protein (S1) containing receptor-binding domain and neutralizing epitopes can determine host specificity and induce the production of neutralizing antibodies [5]. The carboxyl terminal region of S protein (S2) consisting of transmembrane domain is responsible for cell fusion and virus assembly [6]. S gene is a more common target used for coronavirus (CoV) differentiation because S gene is highly variable among different CoVs while M and N genes are more conserved. Within the S gene, the S2 gene is more conserved than S1 gene between different CoVs and between different isolates or strains of the same CoV [7]. Therefore, S2 gene is chosen as a target to detect TCoV and differentiate TCoV from other CoVs.",

            "text": "There is no cell culture system for TCoV; thus virus isolation is not feasible. Because the sequence information of TCoV is available, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR)-based methods with high specificity and sensitivity have been developed [7, 8]. Real-time RT-PCR illustrated here uses a pair of TCoV-specific primers targeting a 186 base-pair fragment of TCoV S2 gene and a dual-labeled probe with a reporter dye (FAM) and a quencher dye (Absolute Quencher\u2122) combined with the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase to increase the release of reporter dye fluorescence in the course of PCR amplification [9]. Quantitative data can be accessed by the standard curve established with serial dilutions of standard RNA. The procedure does not need post-PCR electrophoresis, so the processing time can be significantly reduced and the risks for carryover and cross-contamination between samples can be lessened. In this chapter, the protocol for one-step real-time RT-PCR to detect, differentiate, and quantitative TCoV RNA in the feces and intestinal tissue is presented. In step 1, feces or intestine tissues were collected into RNAlater RNA stabilization reagent. In step 2, TCoV RNA was extracted from feces using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit or intestine tissues using RNAeasy mini kit. In step 3, the extracted RNA was subjected to one-step real-time RT-PCR for detection and quantitation of TCoV in feces or intestine tissues. In step 4, a standard curve was established by serially diluted in vitro-transcribed RNA for absolute quantitation of TCoV.",

Add 0.1 mL DEPC solution to 100 mL of water. DEPC appears as globules and needs continuous stirring until the globules disappear. It takes 12 h at 37 \u00b0C in a fume hood.

It is very critical to mix feces or cloacal swab with RNAlater to make feces submerged and contact RNAlater reagent completely for the stability of RNA in feces.The thickness of tissue must be less than 0.5 cm. RNA in harvested intestine tissue is not protected until the tissue is completely submerged in a sufficient volume of RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent at about 10 \u03bcL reagent per 1 mg tissue. The intestinal content may interfere with the reaction of RNAlater reagent, so it is critical to wash off the intestinal contents. Insufficient RNA reagent may cause RNA degradation during storage. It is not recommended to harvest tissues frozen in liquid nitrogen or dry ice and later thaw them for RNAlater storage or RNA extraction because the process would cause severe RNA degradation.The heat produced by the process of hominization can damage the integrity of RNA in intestine tissues leading to low sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR. Therefore, it is recommended to homogenize the intestine tissue for 30 s and cool the tube in ice in cycles until the intestine tissue is homogenized thoroughly.\nReal-time RT-PCR is a very sensitive assay, so it is very easy to be interfered by bubbles created by pipetting. To use pipettes and take small volume of reagents (<10 \u03bcL) precisely, it is recommended to practice before performing the real test. In addition, the nonspecific reactions can be minimized by mixing reagents on the precooled (store at \u221220 \u00b0C freezer) aluminum loading block (Qiagen) on ice.Example of running a set of samples from the setup to the end of calculating the copy number is illustrated below. First, collect ileum and cecum samples in RNAlater solution from three turkeys at 5 days post- infection of TCoV and the same kind of samples from negative control turkeys without TCoV infection. Second, label the samples from turkeys infected with TCoV as d5-i1 to d5-i3 and d5-c1to d5-c3, and those from negative control turkeys without TCoV infection as N-i1 to N-i3 and N-c1 to N-c3. Third, extract RNA from the samples according to Sect. 3.2.2. Next, arrange the samples in 96-well plate for one-step real-time RT-PCR (Table 3) and set up the real-time RT- PCR conditions. Prepare nuclease-free water as template for the non-template control (NTC) and tenfold serially diluted standard RNA of pTriEx3-6F/6R from 102 to 109 copies/\u03bcL, as STD1 to STD8. After the reaction complete, establish the standard curve formula based on the Ct values of STD1 to STD8. Then, calculate the copy numbers of the tested samples by the standard curve formula. Example for calculating sample concentration is illustrated in Table 4.\n\n\n",
