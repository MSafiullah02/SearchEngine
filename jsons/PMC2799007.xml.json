One-half of these patients are found in Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular taquicardia. Within this group, better survival is achieved with early defibrillation (less than four to eight minutes). Early BLS is also associated with better survival, by delaying the deterioration of the cardiac rhythm to asystole.",

Several weeks before he began to suffer from typical effort angina and that day he was feeling unwell. Basic Life Support (BLS) was started promptly and an Advance Life Support (ALS) team was requested through the national emergency number. Nine minutes after, ALS team arrived and confirmed CA, with VF. The victim was defibrillated with a 200 J shock and BLS resumed. When orotracheal intubation was attempted, masseter muscle contraction was noticed, so BLS was discontinued for reevaluation. The rhythm had become a wide QRS tachycardia with pulse and the victim recovered spontaneous breathing. Partial consciousness was recovered (Glasgow Coma Score: 11). On physical examination blood pressure was 133/62 mmHg, heart rate 130 bpm and pulse oximetry 97%. The patient was transferred to an emergency department. Half an hour later, as he recovered consciousness fully, he complained of chest pain. The ECG showed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 75, right bundle branch block and ST segment depression in in leads V4 to V6. Laboratorial tests showed cardiac troponine I 0.78 ng/ml. A coronary angiography performed urgently, disclosed significant left main plus three vessel \u2014 coronary artery disease. Left anterior descending artery (LAD) was occluded, with late retrograde flow. Eighteen hours after the CA, a quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting operation was undertaken. During surgery, a fresh thrombus was removed from the proximal LAD.",

This can lead to myoglobinuric renal failure, with an incidence of 4\u201333%. A recommended therapeutic approach to prevent myoglobinuric renal failure is the alkalinization of the urine by administering sodium bicarbonate. Retrospective clinical studies and small trials advocate this therapy. However, two recent larger retrospective trials suggested that alkalinization of the urine does not offer any benefit over hydration and maintaining forced diuresis in these patients. We therefore tested the hypothesis, that forced diuresis with large-volume crystalloid infusion is equally effective in protecting renal function in patients with severe rhabdomyolysis than additional alkalinization of the urine.",

This is a significant finding as we know that mortality increases when PCT rises above 1 ng/ml (1) and our study has shown that 30% of BMS would have reported such results in the range outside this value (implying a more severe illness and worse prognosis). This range where there was considerable error for reporting is probably the most important of the 4 values as the transition from 0.5\u20132 to 2\u201310 also represents a change from moderate systemic inflammatory response to severe response most likely due to infection. The difficulty experienced when interpreting those bands appears to be because the band colour is frequently non monochromatic making correlation with the reference card problematic.

To compare the frequency of medication errors before and after the implementation of the PIMS, data of two periods of 15 days each (30 to 15 days before and 60 to 75 days after) were prospectively collected and analyzed. For each period, 150 patient/days were considered. No one of the staff members, but the ICU director, was made aware of the ongoing study. Patients charts were daily revised between 7.00 and 8.00 AM by two independent physicians, not directly involved in patients care. Fluids and medication orders were revised looking for medication errors. The ICU director was immediately notified about any identified error, to allow immediate correction during the ward round.

Although a staged approach to surgery for coronary artery disease and phaeochromocytoma has previously been described1, this rare problem has never been described for patients with poor LV function. METHODS. A59-year-old man with severe triple vessel disease, including 90% left main stem stenosis, poor LV function (EF 10%) and an apical LV aneurysm following a previous myocardial infarction, was admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aneurysmectomy. Following induction in anaesthesia, the operation was abandoned due to uncontrolled hypertension, and he was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) where a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) thermodilution showed cardiac index (CI) 1.6 l min\u22121 m\u22122 and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) 3205 dynes s\u22121 cm\u22125. Urinary catecholamines were elevated and a CT scan showed an adrenal phaeochromocytoma. The patient was pre-optimised with long acting (T\u00bd 24 h) alpha-adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine followed by etablockade with carvedilol and rehydration. A multidisciplinary meeting was called to plan treatment and a combined adrenalectomy-CABG was decided to be the safest approach. The phenoxybenzamine was stopped 2 days prior to readmission to the ICU where a PAC was used for calculations of cardiac output and SVR. Initial measurements revealed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 4 mmHg, CI 2.6 l.min\u22121 m\u22122 and SVR 1548 dynes.s\u22121 cm\u22125. Infusion of short acting (T\u00bd 19 min) alpha-blocker phentolamine was started initially at 0.2 and gradually increased over the next three days to 0.6 \u03bcg.kg\u22121 min\u22121 aiming at SVR of 1200 dynes.s\u22121 cm\u22125. Before anaesthetic induction an intraortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted and used throughout the perioperative period. A sternolaparotomy was performed followed by adrenalectomy, with excellent haemostasis prior to systemic heparinisation. Blood pressure was controlled without problems. Once the adrenal tumour was removed the phentolamine infusion was stopped and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) established. CABG and left ventricular aneurysmectomy were performed. During this time (bypass 59 minutes) the effects of phentolamine had substantially reduced, and CPB was weaned using dopamine 5.8 \u03bcg kg\u22121 min\u22121 and vasopressin 0.01U kg\u22121 min\u22121. The initial readings in ITU post-operatively showed PCWP 9 mmHg, CI 4.9 l.min\u22121 m\u22122 and SVR 418 dynes.s\u22121 cm\u22125. The CI was maintained above 3 l.min\u22121 m\u22122 and the IABP, dopamine and vasopressin were slowly weaned over the next 48 h.",

She was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism (TSH < 0,01 mE/l, FT4 > 70 pmol/l) and a dilated cardiomyopathy with acute decompensation during diving.

Shortly after climbing out of the pool he lost consciousness and was presented on our ER. Brain CT-scan showed no abnormalities and DCS was considered. After consultation of specialized diving physicians, recompression therapy with hyperbaric oxygen was initiated to treat a possible cerebral artery gas embolism.

Repeated imaging by CT and MRI showed ischaemic lesions in the brainstem and cerebellum, together with an irregularity of the right vertebral artery. 48 H later the patient was brain dead and supportive treatment was withdrawn.

Interventions: The patients of Group 1 received intravenous (IV) bolus of Clonidine 0.5 microg/kg followed by continuous infusion of 1\u20132 microg/kg/h all over the weaning protocol phase. The patients of Group 2 received IV continuous infusion of Sodium Chloride 0.9% all over the weaning phase. Data collection: We evaluated hemodynamic parameters, Troponin I (TnI) blood levels, weaning parameters, Delirium Detection Score (DDS) (6), weaning duration and ICU length of stay. The patients were evaluated preoperatively, on ICU admission, after 6 h and 30 minutes after the start of weaning protocol (7).",

Whether the potassium lowering effect of insulin is also effected by changes in renal potassium secretion is unclear. Since the therapeutic goal in hyperkalemia is to remove potassium from the body, it is of relevance if insulin inhibits renal potassium excretion. Most studies in human volunteers have suggested that insulin has an antikaliuretic effect [1]. These studies are however hampered by insufficient control of decreased serum potassium levels. In our ICUs we have a computer supported system called GRIP-II (Glucose and potassium Regulation Intensive care Patients) that strictly regulates potassium levels with periodic adjustments of continuous potassium infusion.

The small priming volume (190 ml), reduced membrane surface area (0.5 m2), and use of a percutaneously inserted dual lumen venous catheter (15 Fr) to provide blood inflow and outflow make the entire system suitable for repetitive use in patients with hypercapnic acute respiratory failure.

In the CLRT group, patients were rotated automatically with the use of a self-inflating mattress, every 20 minutes. All patients suffered from ARDS and were pressure controlled ventilated with the use of a Servo 300(A)\u00ae and Servo-i \u00ae ventilator (Maquet). Static lung compliance was measured on the ventilator. Static compliance was measured before therapy and 4, 8, 16, 24 h after start of therapy. Delta-static compliance was calculated as the difference of static compliance on the different time points minus pre-treatment values for the individual patients.

The stasis of secretions in the airways not only implies a predisposition to pulmonary infection, but can further increases flow airway resistances, that are higher in tetraplegic patients owing to the reduction of functional residual capacity (FRC). To the increased inspiratory resistance corresponds an increased work for the inspiratory muscles that could not always be performed because of the reduction of MIP. The latter is better in supine position due to diaphragm muscle fibers which operates on a more favorable portion of their length-tension curve. However, the higher decrease of FRC in this position implies a reduction of expiratory flow and a cyclic opening/closure of the peripheral airways which are responsible of a chronic lung inflammation.

Inclusion of these markers of tissue oxygenation in resuscitation algorithms has improved patients outcome (1). These measurements require repeated blood withdrawal and/or central venous catheter placement. A rapid and non-invasive measure of tissue oxygenation would be useful. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) allows the measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) at skeletal muscle. In a previous study, our group demonstrated a good correlation between StO2 and ScvO2 in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock with normalized blood pressure (BP), and found that StO2 values below 75% predict low ScvO2 with high specificity (2). The objective of the present study was to analyze whether StO2 below 75% is useful as mortality predictor in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with normalized BP.",
