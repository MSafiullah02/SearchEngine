We inserted a typodont manikin head (KaVo Dental, Charlotte, N.C.) into the headrest position of a dental chair.

We then inserted a typodont (D95SDP-200 32 Teeth Soft Gingivae Type, Kilgore International, Cold-water, Mich.) into the maxillary and mandibular positions of the manikin head. Royal blue fadeless bulletin board paper was trimmed to fit and placed on the wooden platform.",

Specifically, the Isolite system allows for shadowless illumination, isolation, high-speed evacuation, protection of adjacent soft tissues, assistance in opening the mouth and protection from accidental ingestion or aspiration of foreign objects. In addition, in our experience, the device is easy to place and ideal for preparing teeth for fixed prosthodontics, as well as for other situations in which use of a dental dam would hinder access. To use the system, the dentist or a team member connects the HVE of the dental unit to the Isolite device itself.

We also wanted to determine whether tooth position within the quadrant affected the amount of spatter that was produced. Our data show that the amount increased as we moved mesially from tooth no. 18 to 19 and then to 20. However, the only statistically significant increase occurred in moving from tooth no. 18 to tooth no. 20. This increase can be explained by the fact that the source of the water spray (that is, the hand-piece) is positioned closer to the oral aperture for tooth no. 20, and water would be more likely to escape from the mouth than to adhere to the adjacent oral tissue, the dental dam or the Isolite mouthpiece.",

Suction currents and pooled water suction are aided by perforations along the superior and inferior edges of the mouthpiece. It seems logical to us that the greatest evacuation strength would be toward the most posterior aspect of the unit. This is evidenced by the Isolite system's comparable performance for molars in this study.

            "text": "Our study findings indicate that when preparing a posterior tooth in the left mandibular arch, dentists can use either a dental dam with HVE or the Isolite system, because both dry-field techniques reduced spatter significantly compared with use of an HVE alone. As a result, we can reject the null hypothesis that the dry-field techniques would not result in a significant reduction of spatter compared with the control. In addition, we found that, overall, there was no statistically significant difference between the two dry-field techniques in the amount of spatter reduction. The Isolite system appears to be comparable to the dental dam with HVE in its effectiveness in reducing spatter during procedures involving mandibular posterior permanent teeth. Investigators should conduct additional studies to compare these two techniques in different areas of the mouth and to extrapolate these results into an in vivo scenario in which the bacterial content of the spatter can be explored.",
