            "text": "\n1.\nWhat is the length of gestation in queens?\nThe duration of pregnancy in queens is 56\u201369 days. In one cat colony, the average gestation was 66 days. The onset of pregnancy is defined as the first day on which plasma progesterone is > 2.5 ng/ml. If progesterone rise is used as a starting point, the length of gestation in the queen is 63\u201366 days.2.\nHow is pregnancy diagnosed in queens?\nAfter ovulation, the egg is in the oviduct for 5\u20136 days. Fertilization is presumed to occur within the oviducts. The blastocysts become localized and recognized as spherical enlargements within the uterus by day 13\u201314 of gestation. Trophoblastic attachment occurs near day 15 after coitus. The fetal stage occurs when the thoracic cavity of the embryo closes at about 4 weeks when the fetuses have a crown-to-rump length of 2.4 cm. Progesterone concentrations during the first 20 days of pregnancy are similar to those in pseudopregnant cats. After day 20, the plasma progesterone is increased in pregnant cats. The placenta begins to synthesize and secrete progesterone after day 30 of gestation.In one study, a serum progesterone concentration > 5 ng/ml at 6 or more days after breeding was indicative of pregnancy with 81% accuracy. Pregnancy diagnosis in the cat is easily accomplished by ultrasonography 16\u201330 days after breeding, by abdominal palpation 21 days after breeding, and by radiography 37 days after breeding. If a single radiograph is not definitive for pregnancy, a second radiograph taken 5 days later should show progressive mineralization from proximal to distal. Fetal viability is best accessed by ultrasonography, which may demonstrate the fetal heart as early as day 16. Fetal numbers and gestational age are best assessed by radiography.3.\nIn what ways can pregnancy loss occur?\n\u2022Embryonic death\u2022Resorption of the fetus\u2022Abortion of the fetus\u2022Retention of mummified or macerated fetuses\u2022Stillbirths\n4.\nWhat causes pregnancy loss in queens?\nThere are maternal, fetal, and environmental causes of pregnancy loss in the queen. Often the outcome depends on the stage of gestation when the queen is affected; gestational age of the fetus determines whether a nonviable fetus will be resorbed or aborted. Pregnancy resorption with no vulvar discharge occurs before day 30 of gestation. Abortion occurs in the second half of pregnancy. Any fetus delivered before 60 days of gestation will be stillborn.5.\nDefine abortion.\nAbortion results in fetal loss and occurs after mid-gestation in cats. Abortion usually is accompanied by discharge of fluid or fetal tissue. Any hemorrhagic vaginal discharge is abnormal during the second-to-eighth week of pregnancy. The queen may remain clinically healthy despite resorbing fetuses or aborting a litter. Queens may abort part of litter and carry the rest to term. Sometimes it is difficult to tell an aborting cat from one with an open cervix pyometra.6.\nWhat maternal factors may cause abortion?\nAny serious systemic disease can result in resorption or abortion of fetuses. Uterine diseases that can cause abortion include chronic endometritis, cystic endometrial hyperplasia, and uterine adhesions.7.\nHow is abortion diagnosed?\nDefinitive diagnosis of abortion is hard to make unless a fetus is expelled. Habitually aborting queens with multifocal placental necrosis and subsequent fetal autolysis during the third or fourth week of gestation have been reported.8.\nWhat are some environmental causes of pregnancy loss in queens?\nPoor nutrition, trauma, and stress, such as shipping or bringing the cat to a new home, can cause pregnancy loss in a queen. Taurine deficiency causes a postimplantation defect that is associated with a decline in progesterone.9.\nHow is early embryonic death differentiated from failure to conceive?\nPregnancy loss in the first 3 weeks of gestation is also called early embryonic death and cannot be distinguished from failure to conceive. Until an early pregnancy test becomes available for cats, early embryonic death is unlikely to be diagnosed or treated effectively.10.\nCan low plasma progesterone cause pregnancy loss?\nYes. Low progesterone makes the endometrium a poor substrate for implantation of the blastocyst. This clinical scenario appears as an infertile cycle. Resorption or abortion can also occur when the plasma progesterone is < 1 ng/ml; serum progesterone concentrations must be > 2 ng/ml to support pregnancy.11.\nWhat is the source of gestational progesterone in cats?\nThe source of gestational progesterone in cats is debated. Studies have shown that cats have a normal pregnancy despite ovariectomy at 45\u201350 days' gestation, indicating a placental source of progesterone in late gestation. However, other recent studies have indicated that cats ovariectomized at day 45 of gestation abort; thus, the maintenance of the corpus luteum may be crucial for a normal pregnancy in the queen. To diagnose hypoluteoidism, both progesterone drop and early pregnancy have to be confirmed with ultrasound. Hypoluteoidism is probably an uncommon cause of pregnancy loss in the queen.12.\nHow is progesterone measured in cats?\nProgesterone is measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The structure of progesterone does not vary among species; any progesterone assay may be used to determine progesterone levels in queens. Hemolysis and lipemia may affect results.13.\nWhat may cause early embryonic death?\nPossible causes of early embryonic death include taurine deficiency, abnormalities of follicular or luteal function, abnormalities of the genital tract, cystic endometrial hyperplasia, genetic fetal defects, and subclinical uterine infection.14.\nWhat is the most common infectious cause of abortion in queens?\nViral agents are the most commonly reported infectious cause of abortion in queens. Examples include feline herpes virus 1 (FHV-1, rhinotracheitis), panleukopenia, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline calicivirus, and feline leukemia virus (FeLV).15.\nWhen does abortion due to FHV-1 occur?\nAbortion secondary to FHV-1 usually occurs at 5\u20136 weeks of gestation and is probably secondary to upper respiratory infection in the queen. FHV-1 infection can result in abortion, mummification, and stillborns.16.\nHow does panleukopenia affect pregnancy in queens?\nPanleukopenia virus attacks tissue with a high mitotic rate. The queen may have adequate neutralizing antibodies for self-protection but insufficient immunity for the developing fetuses. Panleukopenia can cause early embryonic loss, abortion of mummified or macerated fetuses, and stillbirths. Kittens also may be born blind, with hydrancephaly, and/or ataxia due to retinal, cerebral, and/or cerebellar degeneration. Prenatally infected kittens may have retinal dysplasia. Antemortem definitive diagnosis can be difficult, because many cats have antibodies against panleukopenia but titers only rise during acute viremia.17.\nDiscuss the role of feline coronaviruses in pregnancy loss.\nFeline coronaviruses have been suggested as a cause of failure to conceive, abortion, stillbirth, and congenital defects as well as the fading kitten syndrome (kitten mortality complex). Abortion due to infection with FIP is thought to occur late in gestation and is associated with prolonged vaginal bleeding. However, an epidemiologic study failed to link feline coronavirus with reproductive failure or neonatal kitten mortality; thus its causative role in abortion is controversial.18.\nHow does FIV affect pregnancy in queens?\nIn utero transmission of FIV leads to several pathogenic consequences, including arrested fetal development, abortion, stillbirth, subnormal birth weights, and birth of viable, virus-infected, and asymptomatic but T-cell\u2013deficient kittens.19.\nDiscuss the role of FeLV in pregnany loss.\nFeLV has been reported to cause abortion from 3 weeks to term. FeLV can result in infertility, early embryonic death, resorption of fetuses, and abortion of normal-appearing fetuses. In late pregnancy, fetuses may acquire lymphocyte-associated virus transplacentally, or the neonate may be infected from the queen's milk or saliva. Such kittens may fail to thrive. The queen also may develop pyometra and endometritis due to immunosuppression and then become infertile. Seronegative healthy carriers have been identified. Positive cats should be removed from the cattery with retesting at 90-day intervals until no positive cats are identified on two consecutive tests. FeLV is a fragile virus. Routine cleanliness interrupts spread of disease in the environment. Vaccination of negative cats is also helpful.20.\nWhat is the risk of abortion due to calicivirus?\nTo date, only 2 cats have had calicivirus isolated from the genital tract after abortion. Thus the true risk is unknown.21.\nWhat are the bacterial causes of abortion in queens?\nBacterial infection of the uterus and subsequent pregnancy loss is uncommon in healthy cats housed in a clean environment. Cats aborting due to Escherichia coli, staphylococcal, or streptococcal uterine infection usually present with anorexia, depression, fever, straining, and a fetid, yellow-brown vaginal discharge. The discharge should be cultured, and amoxicillin therapy (22 mg/kg orally every 12 hr) should be instituted pending culture results. Bacterial abortion may occur in cats infected with FeLV secondary to virus-induced immunosuppression. The bacterial pathogens causing abortion are usually present in normal vaginal flora.22.\nWhat are the rickettsial causes of abortion in queens?\n\nCoxiella burnetii is a rickettsial agent that can cause abortion. Cats may acquire the infection by tick bites or ingestion or inhalation of organisms while feeding on infected body tissues or milk. Although the true incidence of this infection in cats in unknown, C. burnetii has been grown from the vagina of normal cats in Japan. There have been frequent reports of people becoming infected with Q fever after exposure to aerosols from a contaminated environment or fomites from feline parturient or aborted tissues (see Chapter 88).23.\nCan protozoal agents cause abortion?\nToxoplasmosis is a common tissue protozoan that occasionally causes abortion. Most queens infected with toxoplasmosis are asymptomatic carriers, but systemically ill queens may abort because of placentitis. Toxoplasmic abortion usually occurs if the first exposure occurs early in gestation.24.\nWhat drugs are associated with abortion or birth defects in cats?\nDrugs associated with abortion include hormones (androgens, bromocriptine, estrogens, glucocorticoids), anticancer drugs, anesthetics (barbiturates, halothane, methoxyflurane), and chloramphenicol. Misoprostol causes abortions due to the effect of prostaglandin on the reproductive tract. Teratogenic drugs include primidone, griseofulvin, ketoconazole, amphotericin-B, ciprofloxacin, and enrofloxacin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, metronidazole, aspirin, propranolol, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), glucocorticoids, diethylstilbestrol (DES), estradiol cypionate (ECP), testosterone, mibolerone, progesterone, diazepam, midazolam, vitamin A, and vitamin D. Teratogens present during the first 26 days often cause cephalic, ocular, otic, and/or cardiac abnormalities, whereas those present in the next 26 days are more likely to cause palate, cerebellar, and/or urogenital defects.25.\nWhat other factors may cause abortion?\nFetal causes of abortions include genetic fetal defects, such as X-monosomy, autosomal trisomy, and mosaicism. Uterine torsion, ectopic pregnancy and, possibly, hypocalcemia are rare causes of abortion. Females older than 7\u20138 years tend to cycle irregularly, to have smaller litters, and to have more problems with abortions and kittens with congenital defects.26.\nAre all causes of stillbirths known?\nThe average rate of stillbirths is 12.9% with a range of 4.7\u201322.1%. Anatomic abnormalities are found in 20% of kittens that are stillborn or die within the first 3 days of life, and most congenital abnormalities have no identifiable cause. Most birth defects have no identifiable cause, and subsequent breedings are often uneventful.27.\nWhat can be done to determine the cause of pregnancy loss?\nPregnancy can be confirmed by day 20 of gestation with ultrasound, and fetal viability can be monitored. Ultrasound also may be used to confirm pregnancy loss before day 20. Breeding records should be scrutinized to identify inherited problems. After an observed abortion, the queen should receive a thorough physical examination and ophthalmic examination. Routine tests in most cases include complete blood cell count, serum biochemical panel, FeLV antigen test, FIV antibody test, panleukopenia antibody test, T. gondii antibody test, urinalysis, and progesterone concentration. Hysterotomy can be done to obtain tissue for histology, microbial isolation, and karyotyping of fetal tissue. Necropsy and histopathology should be performed on aborted or stillborn fetuses.28.\nWhat can be done to decrease pregnancy losses?\nVaccinations should be up to date, and queens should be given antihelmintics before breeding. All cats should be housed indoors in a clean environment. If the cats are gang-housed, multiple litter boxes should be provided and kept clean to lessen coronavirus exposure. The food should be of high quality; raw meat should not be fed during gestation to lessen the risk for toxoplasmosis. All breeding females should test negative for FeLV and FIV. No drugs causing abortion or birth defects should be given during pregnancy. Vaccines should not be given during pregnancy.29.\nWhat contraceptives are available for cats?\nProgestogens can prevent pregnancy in cats. Megestrol acetate (Ovaban; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) is given at 2.5 mg orally every 24 hr for up to 2 months or 5 mg/day for 3 days, followed by 2.5 mg/week for up to 18 months. Side effects of progestogens in cats may be severe and include mammary carcinoma, mammary hypertrophy/fibroadenoma complex, uterine disease, diabetes mellitus, and suppression of the adrenal cortex. Progestogens are not approved for use as contraceptives in cats in the U.S. Preliminary studies in cats have shown that the slow-release subdermal implant levonorgestral (Norplant) is effective in suppressing estrus for 12 months with no adverse effects except the development of cystic endometrial hyperplasia.Mibolerone (Checque; Pharmacia & Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI), an androgen approved for use as a contraceptive in dogs, cannot be used safely in cats because the side effects include thyroid dysfunction, hepatocellular lesions with increased systemic arterial pressure and cholesterol, thickening of the cervical dermis, and clitoral hypertrophy. The mortality rate is significant with doses as low as twice the estrus suppression dose. Contraceptive vaccines that immunize against the zona pellucida surrounding the feline ova also may be used for contraception, but this method is not currently available.30.\nHow should an unwanted pregnancy be terminated?\nNo drugs are approved for feline pregnancy termination in the United States, but several protocols have been used. Mating should be confirmed with a vaginal smear to look for clearing (absence of noncellular debris) and sperm. Estrogen is not recommended immediately after mating, but megestrol acetate in a single oral dose of 2.0 mg during estrus has been reported to prevent implantation. Pregnancy termination in cats can be effected surgically (ovariohysterectomy) or medically. Medical methods include prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1; Lutalyse, Pharmacia & Upjohn) at 500\u20131000 \u03bcg/kg for 2 days at mid-gestation; cloprostenol (Estrumate; Bayer, Shawnee Mission, KS) at 5 \u03bcg/kg subcutaneously for 2 days; and the prolactin inhibitor/dopamine agonist, cabergoline (Dostinex; Pharmacia & Upjohn), at 5 \u03bcg/kg orally for 10\u201312 days at mid-gestation. A combination of daily oral administration of cabergoline (5 \u03bcg/kg) and cloprostenol injections (5 \u03bcg/kg subcutaneously) every 2 days appears to be a reliable, safe, and practical method for terminating pregnancy at day 30 of pregnancy, when a diagnosis of pregnancy by palpation or ultrasonography can easily be made. All five queens treated in one study aborted in 9 \u00b1 1 day without side effects except a mild hemorrhagic vulvar discharge. Progesterone concentrations were < 1 ng ml by day 38.A PGF2\u03b1 abortifacient protocol, administered near day 45 of gestation, was effective in 3 of 4 cats in one study. On the first day, 0.2 mg/kg/day was given, followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day. The cats were treated subcutaneously twice daily until abortion occurred or for up to 5 days. All cats receiving PGF2\u03b1 had decreasing concentrations of progesterone during treatment. Cats that aborted had < 1 ng/ml, whereas cats that did not abort had > 1 ng/ml of progesterone. Cats should be hospitalized during the administration of prostaglandins. Nesting behavior may be observed 1\u20132 days before the abortion, and a temperature drop similar to the one observed with normal parturition may be seen within 24 hours of abortion.\n",
