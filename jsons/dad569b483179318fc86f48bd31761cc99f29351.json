            "text": "Background: Conceptually, the \"control of gut overgrowth\" (COGO) is key in mediating prevention against infection with Gram-negative bacilli by topical antibiotic prophylaxis, a common constituent of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) regimens. However, the relative importance of the other SDD components, enteral and protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis, versus other methods of infection prevention and versus other contextual exposures cannot be resolved within individual studies. Methods: Seven candidate generalized structural equation models founded on COGO concepts were confronted with Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter bacteremia as well as ventilator-associated pneumonia data derived from > 200 infection prevention studies. The following group-level exposures were included in the models: use and mode of antibiotic prophylaxis, anti-septic and non-decontamination methods of infection prevention; proportion receiving mechanical ventilation; trauma ICU; mean length of ICU stay; and concurrency versus non-concurrency of topical antibiotic prophylaxis study control groups. Results: In modeling Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter gut overgrowth as latent variables, anti-septic interventions had the strongest negative effect against Pseudomonas gut overgrowth but no intervention was significantly negative against Acinetobacter gut overgrowth. Strikingly, protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis and concurrency each have positive effects in the model, enteral antibiotic prophylaxis is neutral, and Acinetobacter bacteremia incidences are high within topical antibiotic prophylaxis studies, moreso with protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis exposure. Paradoxically, topical antibiotic prophylaxis (moreso with protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis) appears to provide the strongest summary prevention effects against overall bacteremia and overall VAP. Conclusions: Structural equation modeling of published Gram-negative bacillus infection data enables a test of the COGO concept. Paradoxically, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas bacteremia incidences are unusually high among studies of topical antibiotic prophylaxis. Take home message TAP-based decontamination regimens appear superior versus other methods at reducing incidences of overall VAP and bacteremia infections among ICU patients. Structural equation modeling of published Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter infection data enables a test of the control of gut overgrowth concept in the mediation of TAP-based decontamination. Paradoxically, both Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas bacteremia incidences are unusually high among studies of TAP.",

Moreover, the relative importance of the individual SDD components, topical (TAP), enteral (EAP), and protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis (PPAP; not contained within SOD regimens), versus other methods of infection prevention and versus other contextual exposures such as length of stay and being in a trauma ICU context remains unclear. In addition, concurrency, being the concurrent mixing of study and control patients within the ICU, as typically occurs within randomized concurrent control studies, is believed to influence the results of SOD/SDD studies versus studies without concurrency (i.e., concurrent versus non-concurrent control; CC versus NCC) [10, 12] .",

In studying the relative prevention effects of SDD versus SOD each versus standard care in the prevention of Gram-negative bacteremias (i.e., not limited to Pseudomonas bacteremia), the majority of bacteremias occur after 4 days in the ICU (the typical duration of PPAP) and indeed the daily risk peaks after day 30 [11, 31] . Moreover, among patients receiving SDD or SOD, Pseudomonas accounts for one third of GN bacteremia episodes with most episodes not preceded by enteral colonization.",

In this regard, a non-significant increase in hospital-acquired infections post discharge from the ICU as great as 50% was noted in a small SDD sub-study [34] . In critical care research, SEM is emerging as a method to model the relationships among multiple simultaneously observed variables in order to provide a quantitative test of any theoretical model proposed within the literature [35] . The use of latent variables within the model enables the ability to test the validity of concepts that can only be indirectly quantified through their inferred relationship to observed variables [36] .

These latent variables and the coefficients derived in the GSEM are indicative and intended for internal reference only. They have no counterpart at the level of any one patient or study and cannot be directly measured. There was no ability nor purpose to adjust for the underlying patient-level risk. There was considerable heterogeneity in the interventions, populations, and study designs among the studies here as the inclusion criteria for the various studies have been intentionally broadly specified. In this regard, a strength of the analysis is that the heterogeneity among the studies here generally resembles that expected among ICU populations to which these interventions might be targeted.",

In reality, the relationships between exposures and outcomes will likely be complex and exposure interactions could have great importance. Thirdly, the analysis is likely underpowered to examine the Acinetobacter infection data, being a relatively rare end point. Likewise, the incidences of resistant infections with Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas are of great interest. However, examination of the incidence of these resistant infections is difficult as these end points are generally uncommon or rare and have been inconsistently reported among these studies here.",
