Globally, 7.6 million children died before the age of 5 years in 2010 with 64 % dying from infections. The major infections causing death in children include pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria (Liu et al. 2010) . Cancer is listed as the fourth most common cause of death in the industrialized world in children less than 15 years of age (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Environmental Heat 2003). In the United States (USA), from data obtained from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality data for 1999-2009, the leading cause of death (all causes) in childhood (excluding neonates) was attributed to external causes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Center for Health Statistics 1999). In the neonatal period (up to 28 days following birth), the leading cause of death involved conditions that originated in the neonatal period, followed by congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities, and diseases of the circulatory system with primary pulmonary hypertension being number one. Beyond the neonatal period, congenital malformations including chromosomal abnormalities, trauma including child abuse, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are some of the most common causes of death and will be covered elsewhere in the text. Table 30 .1 depicts the five most common childhood-acquired diseases categorized by pediatric age groups in the USA.

In a recent US autopsy study evaluating causes of death in previously healthy or near-healthy children presenting to a children's hospital, more than half of the deaths occurred in children less than 1 year old, and infectious causes were the leading cause of death.

Asthma (J45-J46) (continued) results in a decrease in energy production, metabolic rate, and normal cellular responses (Singer et al. 2004) . SIRS involves the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to infection or injury and/or ischemia. The pro-inflammatory response is often followed by a compensatory anti-inflammatory mediator release. An imbalance between the pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators results in an immunologic imbalance with systemic inflammation. Most children who die from sepsis generally have the most severe form -septic shock with evidence of multiple-organ failure that can include acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and ischemic injury to multiple organs. When sepsis is suspected, it is important to consider obtaining cultures of blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissues. More recently, some have advocated obtaining blood for the determination of biochemical sepsis markers such as procalcitonin, although reliable postmortem reference values are lacking (Tsokos 2007; Riedel et al. 2011) . Autopsy findings in some cases of sepsis are often nonspecific (Tsokos 2007) . In a majority of cases, there should be some nidus of infection (e.g., pneumonia) identifiable on postmortem examination. An example is Neisseria meningitides sepsis. In such cases, typically there are skin changes (e.g., petechial or purpuric rash), cloudy or purulent meninges, and bilateral hemorrhagic adrenal necrosis (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome), although Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is not specific for Neisseria sepsis. In cases of treated or partially treated sepsis, there may not be a clear-cut nidus of infection; however, there typically is evidence of end-organ damage with varying changes throughout the body (Torgersen et al. 2009 ). Cultures from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and/or tissues should be considered particularly when the etiologic agent is unknown. The culture results often may be the only evidence of sepsis found on postmortem examination. The yield of other postmortem testing for infectious organisms has improved with detection of infectious agents by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescence, and detection of early antigen-fluorescent foci using postmortem tissue samples as has been shown in evaluating sudden unexpected deaths in infancy with consistent use of ancillary investigations (Weber et al. 2008 (Weber et al. , 2010 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 429, "end": 433, "text": "K93)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 700, "end": 704, "text": "G99)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1161, "text": "G99)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1842, "text": "G99)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2196, "end": 2216, "text": "(Singer et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 3119, "end": 3132, "text": "(Tsokos 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 3133, "end": 3152, "text": "Riedel et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3218, "end": 3231, "text": "(Tsokos 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 3869, "end": 3891, "text": "(Torgersen et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 4491, "end": 4509, "text": "(Weber et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 4510, "end": 4530, "text": "(Weber et al. , 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Age group"}, {"text": "In general, skin changes can include ulcerations, cellulitis, erythema, petechial hemorrhages, purpura, ecchymoses, bullae (both intact and ruptured), and skin desquamation.

On examination of the organs, there may be little to no abnormal changes, or marked changes resulting from the dissemination of infection, or changes related to hypotension and septic shock. It is not uncommon to see petechiae or hemorrhages on the organ surfaces, particularly the pleura, heart, and thymus. The liver and spleen may be enlarged, softened, and have wrinkled capsules. On sectioning, the spleen may show deliquescence (liquefaction). The liver parenchyma may have accentuation of the lobular architecture, centrilobular hemorrhage, and necrosis. In severe cases of sepsis, there may also be evidence of cholestasis or steatosis. The lungs, heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys may contain infarcts. In the lungs, there may be evidence of edema and congestion, pneumonia, abscess, or diffuse alveolar damage. Diffuse adrenal hemorrhage can be seen in some cases of bacterial sepsis, most notably in association with Neisseria meningitidis sepsis ( Fig. 30.1 ).

Most cases can be linked to contaminated water and food supplies. Although improvements in the management and prevention of infectious gastroenteritis have reduced the number of deaths over the past several decades, the number of hospitalizations remains high even in developed countries. The causative agents of diarrhea in developing countries include rotaviruses, Norwalk-like viruses, enteric adenoviruses, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter species, cytotoxigenic Clostridium difficile, and Cryptosporidium. Viral diarrhea tends to occur in the winter or dry seasons. In tropical areas in developing countries, the mortality from diarrheal infections is estimated at 4.6 million deaths per year (12,600 deaths per day in children), and in some areas the mortality exceeds 25 % in children less than 5 years of age. Outbreaks of diarrheal disease occur in child-care centers with rotavirus infections occurring in children under 2 years of age and Giardia lamblia infection in older children (Guerrant et al. 1990 ). Rotavirus infection accounts for approximately 1.2 million deaths worldwide in children less than 5 years of age (Tate et al. 2012) . Rotavirus selectively infects small-intestinal mature enterocytes without disrupting crypt cells which results in repopulation of the surface epithelium by immature secretory cells. The loss of absorption and increase in secretory cells result in a net secretion of water and electrolytes that combines with an osmotic diarrhea from poor absorption of nutrients. Acute diarrheal infections in children can quickly result in severe dehydration and metabolic acidosis that can result in death. In some cases, the child may appear to be adequately hydrated and therefore an acute gastroenteritis may not be suspected. In such cases, dehydration may be overlooked (Staat et al. 2005) . Various body fluids can be used for biochemical testing; however, vitreous fluid is the most stable and can be used for many metabolic tests. In suspected cases of infectious gastroenteritis, consideration to evaluate electrolytes in vitreous fluid should be entertained along with the possibility of obtaining gastric or intestinal contents for ancillary studies to determine the etiologic agent. Rotavirus infection can be made by rapid antigen testing of stool by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or latex agglutination tests. Rapid latex and Dot-ELISA tests can be utilized and are both sensitive and specific for rotavirus. More recently, the ImmunoCard STAT \u00ae Rotavirus kit has become available. The ImmunoCard STAT \u00ae Rotavirus kit is an easy, rapid, cost-effective test that detects monoclonal antibodies to rotavirus in stool samples.

With acute viral enterocolitis, the bowel may appear dilated and filled with flocculent fluid. After emptying the intestines and stomach and for better preservation, it is helpful to rinse the samples in formalin rather than water. Most infections show a nonspecific pattern of damage to the surface epithelium. Acute enterocolitis appears as diffusely red with a thickened mucosa.

In particular yersiniosis, chlamydia, and tuberculosis can cause granulomatous disease, often with necrosis which is not usually seen in other noninfectious enterocolitides such as Crohn disease.

Vitreous is the specimen for analysis and is preferred over blood samples because of the postmortem breakdown and autolysis that occurs in serum. Although potassium is unstable in vitreous, sodium, chloride, creatinine, and urea nitrogen can remain stable for up to 120 h following death.

The most common portal of entry is by hematogenous spread. Meningitis is an inflammatory process of the leptomeninges and CSF. When the inflammation extends to involve the brain parenchyma, it is referred to as meningoencephalitis. Infectious meningitis/meningoencephalitis can be divided broadly into three categories on the basis of the inflammatory infiltrate. In acute pyogenic or bacterial meningitis, Escherichia coli and group B streptococci are the most common bacterial etiologic agents in neonates; Hemophilus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza (particularly in developing countries with no access to the vaccines for pneumococcus and Hemophilus influenza type b), and Neisseria meningitidis are most common in infants and children; and Neisseria meningitidis is the most common bacterial pathogen in adolescents and young adults. Acute aseptic meningitis is most often caused by viruses and is generally a benign disease with seasonal variation. In most instances, children who die with aseptic meningitis have concurrent systemic illness (e.g., enteroviral infection with concurrent myocarditis and hepatic necrosis with coagulopathy. The most common viral etiologic agents of aseptic meningitis include echoviruses, Coxsackie A and B viruses, herpes simplex viruses, mumps and measles viruses, adenoviruses, arboviruses, and more recently lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Viral Vitreous reference range for sodium is 135-150 mmol/L, for chloride is 105-135 mmolL, for creatinine is 0.6-1.3 mg/dL, and for urea nitrogen is 8-20 mg/dL (Collins 2011) meningitis is most prevalent in children less than 5 years of age, and the most common etiologic agents in this age group are enteroviruses. The third major category encompasses the chronic bacterial meningoencephalitides including tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, and Lyme disease. The morbidity and mortality depend on a number of factors including infectious agent, age, health state, and how quickly the diagnosis and treatment occur. Pediatric meningitis is most common in children under the age of 4 years and peaks between 3 and 8 months of age. The overall mortality for bacterial meningitis is 5-10 %. In neonates, the death rate is 15-20 %, and in older children it is 3-10 %. The highest mortality rates are with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenza type b, and Neisseria meningitidis (Muller 2012) . Although the worldwide prevalence of tuberculosis in children is difficult to assess, it is estimated that 40,000 tuberculosis-related deaths occur annually, and 1 of every 300 untreated primary cases of tuberculosis develops tuberculous meningitis. The prevalence of tuberculous meningitis is highest in children less than 5 years of age (Ramachandran 2011) .

The sweat test is the most readily available way of establishing a diagnosis, although newborn screening is currently done by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) in blood spots. A high IRT is suggestive of pancreatic injury which may be indicative of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis affects fluid secretions in exocrine glands and the epithelial lining of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and male reproductive tracts. Histologically, it does not affect the sweat glands. In this disease, there is abnormal viscid mucus secretion that obstructs passages in the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, and gonads. Although survival has improved over time, at least 80 % of cystic fibrosis-related deaths are due to respiratory insufficiency (O'Sullivan and Freedman 2009). Cysticfibrosis pulmonary disease is characterized by chronic pulmonary infection, progressive bronchiectasis, gas trapping, hypoxemia, and hypercarbia. At birth, the lungs in cystic fibrosis are normal; however, early on, the lungs become inflamed. Patients with cystic fibrosis commonly get Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory infections that initially grow as a non mucoid strain. Eventually the organism synthesizes biofilms and becomes difficult to eradicate with conventional antibiotics. These patients can also become infected with other microbes including Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and atypical mycobacteria. During the neonatal period other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis include meconium ileus, jaundice, intestinal atresia, abdominal or scrotal calcifications, and pancreatic insufficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency often leads to protein and fat malabsorption manifested by diarrhea, abdominal distention, poor weight gain, and significant failure to thrive. Malnutrition and dehydration can result in death. Meconium ileus is a common cause of death in neonates with cystic fibrosis (Oppenheimer 1981) . During infancy, persistent infiltrates are commonly present on chest x-ray, and commonly these infants have Staphylococcus aureus or Hemophilus influenza pneumonia. In early infancy, acute respiratory infections commonly are the cause of death, and in late infancy into childhood, chronic pulmonary changes are usual, with or without superimposed acute pneumonia. In addition, infants may have abdominal distention, chronic diarrhea, cholestasis, and failure to thrive. During childhood into adolescence, chronic pansinusitis or nasal polyps, steatorrhea, rectal prolapse, intussusception or intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, liver disease, bronchiectasis, hemoptysis, bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and delayed puberty may be present (O'Sullivan and Freedman 2009). Sudden death can occur from a volvulus with intestinal ischemia in patients with cystic fibrosis. In addition, mucus plugging, duct dilation, and fibrosis affect the pancreas in up to 90 % of patients with cystic fibrosis.

Anaphylaxis commonly involves the synthesis of IgE in response to allergen exposure. The allergen becomes fixed to IgE high-affinity receptors on the surface membranes of mast cells and basophils and leads to the release of inflammatory mediators including histamine, tryptase, carboxypeptidase A, proteoglycans, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, cytokines (Il-6, IL-33, TNr-a), and platelet-activating factors. Mainly mast-cell degranulation leads to systemic vasodilation that is associated with a sudden fall in blood pressure, bronchial mucosal edema, bronchoconstriction, and dyspnea (Unkrig et al. 2010) . Triggers for anaphylaxis include certain types of food, medications, venoms, latex, occupational allergens, seminal fluid, and inhaled allergens. Food allergies are the most common trigger of anaphylaxis seen in hospital emergency room visits. Although most persons can be adequately treated, when death occurs, the symptom onset is most commonly within 0-30 min. Death occurs within the first hour of onset and is usually due to asphyxiation from laryngeal or oropharyngeal swelling, collapse from hypotensive shock, cardiac arrest, or acute severe bronchoconstriction causing respiratory failure and arrest (Greenberger et al. 2007 ). Peanut and tree-nut ingestions account for >85 % of all food-related anaphylactic deaths in the USA. Food allergyinduced anaphylaxis can occur without skin manifestations. Risk factors for fatal food allergy-induced anaphylaxis include asthma, failure to use epinephrine auto-injections promptly, a prior history of severe reactions, known food allergy, denial of symptoms, and adolescent or young-adult age (Greenberger and Ditto 2012) . The relationship between asthma and severe anaphylactic reactions, in particularly food, is well established. A high percentage of fatal and near-fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in children, adolescents, and young adults with known asthma in which the mechanism of death was most commonly attributed to severe bronchospasm and respiratory arrest (Sampson et al. 1992 ). In examining deaths from possible anaphylaxis, it is important to elicit a history of known allergies and/or asthma, possible witnessed or documented exposures to allergic triggers, as well as circumstances, timing, and symptoms prior to death.

Although rare, SUDC occurs most commonly between the ages of 1 and 4 years with an annual incidence of 1.2/100,000. Such cases are likely to be investigated by a forensic pathologist. SUDC most commonly is due to occult cardiac anomalies, intracranial hemorrhage, (Somers et al. 2006) . In evaluation of SUDC cases from a registry, 24 % of children were found to have a history of febrile seizures that reportedly correlated with a fivefold increase in incidence compared to the general pediatric population (Kinney et al. 2009 ). An association has been shown between sudden death in children with a history of, or family history of, febrile seizures and hippocampal and temporal-lobe abnormalities. In these cases, the children were found dead in bed in a prone position, and the mechanism of death appeared analogous with that of sudden death in epilepsy. Febrile seizures involve the development of seizure activity that is associated with a febrile illness with no associated underlying central nervous system infection. These can either be simple seizures (e.g., tonic-clonic seizures lasting less than 10 min and occurring only once within 24 h) or complex seizure (e.g., prolonged focal or multiple seizures lasting greater than 10-15 min and with multiple seizures within a 24-h period). Most febrile seizures are simple and occur between 6 months and 36 months of age. In 30-50 % of cases, there is recurrence of the seizures, especially if the onset is before 1 year of age (Jones and Jacobsen 2007) . The occurrence of an initial febrile seizure has been shown to be associated with a history of seizures in first-or second-degree relatives, day-care attendance, developmental delay, viral infections (e.g., influenza A, human herpesvirus 6, metapneumovirus), iron-deficiency anemia, and vaccinations (e.g.,", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 274, "text": "(Krous et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 541, "end": 561, "text": "(Somers et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 785, "end": 804, "text": "(Kinney et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1787, "text": "(Jones and Jacobsen 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood and Seizure Disorders"}, {"text": "Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent seizures as a result of excessive discharge of neurons. In childhood, epilepsy can be symptomatic with a known cause, cryptogenic when an underlying condition is suggested, or idiopathic when there is no associated neurological condition or history of developmental delay (Donner et al. 2001 ). The mortality rate of individuals with epilepsy is two to three times higher than the general population. In children, the mortality rate may be 90 times higher than children without epilepsy, and while most cases of epilepsy can be explained by an underlying condition, there is a proportion of these cases in which the circumstances and autopsy fail to explain the death (Donner 2011) . Such cases are classified as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Risk factors for SUDEP include early onset of seizures, refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and polytherapy. A single mechanism is unlikely to explain all cases of SUDEP. Impaired brainstem function and heritable arrhythmogenic syndromes and channelopathies may help explain the mechanisms of SUDEP (Donner 2011) . SUDEP refers to a witnessed or unwitnessed, nontraumatic, and non drowning death in a patient with epilepsy with or without evidence of a seizure, excluding documented status epilepticus, in which postmortem examination reveals no toxicological or anatomical cause of death (Nashef et al. 2012) . It has been proposed that if investigation of the circumstances surrounding death indicates status epilepticus, for SUDEP to be excluded as the cause of death, the duration of the seizure activity should be more than 30 min (Nashef et al. 2012 ). Moreover, asphyxia or suffocation has been implicated as a cause of sudden death in persons with epilepsy particularly when the body position is such that the airway could be obstructed. As a high percentage of SUDEP deaths occur at night with the decedent found dead prone in bed, asphyxia or suffocation may at least contribute to death. Ascribing SUDEP solely to asphyxia or suffocation may be simplistic as studies have shown that cerebral mechanisms also lead to respiratory compromise in the peri-ictal state. Additionally, when death occurs in water without circumstantial or autopsy evidence of submersion, a proposed classification is \"possible SUDEP.\" These instances and further categorization of SUDEP cases have been proposed with examples of scenarios that may help in subclassifying cases (Nashef et al. 2012) . In evaluating pediatric sudden deaths, it is imperative to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, any known medical history including the character of the seizures (e.g., presence of intractable seizure and history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures) (Lathers et al. 2011) , along with full postmortem examination and ancillary testing.

Liposarcomas and leiomyosarcomas are more common in adults but do occur in children. Because such tumors are rare in children, the focus will be on bone and soft tissue malignancies that more commonly occur in children. Although bone and soft tissue tumors almost never cause sudden death in children, the forensic pathologist should be familiar with common types of tumors in children that may be encountered at autopsy.

Rhabdomyosarcomas are the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children below 15 years of age and make up half of all soft tissue sarcomas.

The most frequent site for rhabdomyosarcomas is the head and neck followed by the genitourinary tract, extremities, trunk, and retroperitoneum.

Sicklecell disease (SCD) is one of the most common childhood single-gene disorders. Sickle-cell disease results from the presence of a mutation in the hemoglobin gene that causes substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the sixth position of the b-globin chain. Sickle-cell disease occurs when a person is homozygous for HbS, and the hallmark of the disease is vaso-occlusion and hemolysis which leads to sickle-cell crisis. Sickle-cell trait is the heterozygote form (HbAS) which occurs when a person has one normal Hb gene and one for HbS. Sickle-cell trait is most frequently found in areas where malaria is endemic (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Sicily, Greece, Turkey, and India). It is the most common inherited hematologic disorder in the USA with approximately 1 in 12 African Americans having SCT. Under low-oxygen tension, sickling of red blood cells occurs. Clinical manifestations or complications associated with SCT include exercise-related sudden death, exertional rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, high anion gap, metabolic acidosis, and splenic sequestration and/or infarcts (Thogmartin et al. 2011; Goldsmith et al. 2012 ). Causes of death in sickle-cell disorders based on autopsy studies include infection, stroke, complications of therapy, pulmonary thromboemboli and fat/bone-marrow emboli, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema, splenic sequestration, and chronic organ failure Manci et al. 2003) .

This occurs particularly during intense exercise in suboptimally conditioned individuals, at high altitudes, or when an individual is dehydrated or hyperthermic (Key and Derebail 2010) . The estimated risk of exertional death in African American Division I football athletes with sickle-cell trait is 37 times greater than athletes without SCT. Because of the increased risk, screening for SCT and simple precautions for college-level athletes have been advocated (NCAA 2010). For cases in which death was delayed long enough for athletes to receive medical intervention, it has been demonstrated that the athletes had exerted effort beyond their conditioning level, and all had evidence of metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and DIC Photomicrographs from an adolescent with sickle-cell disease beta thalassemia (a) lung, high-magnification H&E stain, showing multiple fat globules within the small arterioles (black arrows) and distention of the alveolar wall capillaries by fat globules (white arrows) (Hematoxylin and Eosin, H&E \u00c210) (b) brain, high-power H&E stain showing distention of a capillary with a single fat globule (arrow) and surrounding infarct with macrophage infiltration (Hematoxylin and Eosin, H&E \u00c210) (c) kidney, high-magnification H&E stain showing distention of the glomerular capillaries with fat globules (arrows) (Hematoxylin and Eosin, H&E \u00c220) in the liver.

Typically, sickle-shaped (pointed or tapered ends) red blood cells can be seen in the microvasculature of multiple organs; however this is a common postmortem finding in sickle-cell disease (Fig. 30.11). Careful evaluation for fat or bone marrow emboli within the microvasculature should be undertaken as fat emboli can result from bone marrow infarction which is typical of pain crisis (Fig. 30.12). Fat emboli demonstrated in multiple organs (e.g., lungs, brain, and kidney) may indicate fat emboli syndrome which can be a cause of sudden death (Fig. 30.13a-c).
