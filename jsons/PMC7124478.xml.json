This is expressed, for example, in the recent establishment of special research centers such as UCLA's Institute on Inequality and Democracy, LSE's International Inequality Institute, Stanford's Center on Poverty and Inequality, and the University of Amsterdam Centre for Inequality Studies. It is also apparent, of course, in the literature. The work by Thomas Piketty (2014), particularly, drew much attention and it was emblematic of a wider trend across the academy (e.g., Stiglitz, 2012) and in public debates and popular media (e.g., The Economist, 2019).",

In such studies, inequality trends are often related to issues of economic globalization, international migration, and neoliberal government policies. Many studies rely exclusively on income data even though it is widely acknowledged that inequality is a multifaceted phenomenon with economic, social, environmental, and political dimensions. Variations across class, race, ethnicity, age, gender, or citizenship status are also often considered at the national level.",

In some respects, this tradition goes back as far as the urban ecology approach of the Chicago School. There appears, however, a significant disconnect with the more general social science literature and much of that is probably due to different scales of analysis and the attention (or lack thereof) to the role of space in the creation or maintenance of inequality.",

In part, this is simply a reflection of rapid and ongoing urbanization worldwide, where social questions are increasingly urban questions (Brenner & Schmid, 2014; Wang, He, Liu, Zhuang, & Hong, 2012). It is also, we argue, related to the worldwide emergence of new modes of production in the last few decades (digital, information-based, consumer oriented) that signal an unprecedented urbanization of the world economy, what Scott (2017) refers to as the \u201cthird wave\u201d. Finally, we argue that this new, largely urban-based, economy is accompanied by new and deepening inequalities across multiple dimensions. Our argumentation is based on a broad overview of the literature, in part from a comparative perspective (Nijman, 2015a), and with special attention to the other articles in this special journal issue. Our main point is that, if we want to understand overall inequality trends in the 21st century and the policies needed to confront them, it is imperative to consider their urban contexts.",

On the basis of theoretically guided empirical research, it examines spatial and temporal dimensions of socio-economic inequality, analyzes the significance of the urban context of inequalities, and provides insights for urban planners and administrators to balance efficiency, equity, and environment. Its point of departure comprises the following broad research questions:\u2022What are the trends and nature of inequality in the city/cities in question? What are the temporal and spatial dynamics?\u2022What is the explanation for these inequality trends and, specifically, how do they relate to (a) urbanization trends, (b) shifting modes of production and changing urban political economies, and (c) local/national urban policies?\u2022How do economic inequalities interact with disparaties in terms of race, gender, age, ethnicity, and migration-status?\u2022How is urban inequality manifested in residential segregation, spatial mismatch, housing inequality, digital divide, environmental injustice, and in general spatial inequality?\u2022What are the theoretical and policy implications of the research?\n",

Proper understanding of current urban inequalities requires a fundamental understanding of such recent shifts in the nature of production and of the spatial ramifications of these shifts, particularly at the urban scale. As we argue below, the new economy has propelled urban inequalities in three ways: (1) greater bifurcation of the workforce and deepening income inequalities; (2) increasing inter-urban inequalities (growth vs. shrinkage); and (3) revival of central cities and urban centers that have become increasingly exclusionary, along with increased \u2018sorting\u2019 and inequalities between different suburban areas.",

There is no need here for a general review but it is worth noting that the manufacturing era generally witnessed urban growth and expansion of the (lower) middle classes. The later decline of manufacturing in North America and Europe since the 1960s was directly related to the ensuing urban crisis, one aspect of which involved the shrinking of the working middle classes. For the purpose of this paper, we are particularly interested in what happened since the 1980s and in more recent years.",

The recovery of urban growth since around 1990 was in essence based on the emergence of a new economy; a new mode of production that was, even more than during the industrial age, emphatically situated in urban areas. Instead of manufactured goods, the new economy revolves around information products and was propelled by the digital revolution. It involves mainly finance and professional and business services (accounting, insurance, advertising, consulting, marketing), cultural industries (Sassen, 2012; Scott, 2017), and, in some urban areas, high-tech industries (e.g., Silicon Valley, The Texas Corridor, the NC Research Triangle, etc.).",

Half of them are in finance, three in insurance, and the other two in information technology and pharmacology.

For some of the cities that did not follow the example of New York, deindustrialization had lasting and deeply erosive effects; the transition to an urban information economy, high-tech production and especially consumption never quite arrived and the return to growth never happened. In 2017, one in ten U.S. cities had shrinking populations and the experience is not unique to the United States. For example, one-third of Germany's cities are losing population; the same is happening in varying degrees across Europe and, notably, also in Japan and South Korea. In some countries, the problem is compounded by low birth rates and slow or even negative overall population growth.",

While cities such as New York and others revived against the backdrop of this dynamic new economy, the benefits did not accrue equally across the urban population. In fact, the new economy has only deepened the inequality that crystallized during the period of deindustrialization and urban decline. Professional workers in the new economy tend to be highly educated, highly skilled, and highly paid. The service workers in that same economy, from retail personnel to clerical staff to hospitality workers, tend to be low-skilled and low-paid. Accordingly, the new urban economy is characterized by a bi-modal income distribution, a bifurcated workforce, and a polarized social structure (e.g., Sassen, 2012). To keep with the example of New York: in 2016, the top 1% of income earners took 40% of all income while the bottom half had to make do with 6% (NYIBO, 2017). Nationally, in terms of wealth (of greater significance than income to the truly advantaged), in 2014 the top 0.1% of the U.S. population had more than doubled its wealth since 1980 and controlled as much as the bottom 90% (Saez & Zucman., 2014).",

Those suburbs may at the same time witness an influx of foreign migrants or the very people who are being displaced from the center. Gentrification has been prominent feature of central city revival. Many older inhabitants have had to find more affordable housing in the suburbs and, as a result, suburbia has become increasingly sorted on the basis of socio-economic status and race (Nijman, 2020; Nijman & Clery, 2015).

Digital inequality has arisen as a huge concern as rapid technological change further centralizes talents, capital and innovation, and leaves many places behind. Interregional knowledge spillovers only happen when the technological gap is not too wide (Nocco, 2005), hence technological advances may lead to greater regional inequality and polarization. Technology also results in other dimensions of urban inequality, such as residential segregation, which should be carefully addressed by urban planners and policy makers (Florida & Mellander, 2020).",

Preferences, and even discrimination, of different groups combined with differences in income, education, age, and race result in residential segregation (Clark, 2009; Ihlanfeldt & Scafidi, 2002), Such differentials are also reflected in the existence of housing submarkets (Wu, Wei, & Li, 2019).

Housing prices are also often cyclical, and the recent global financial crisis was largely caused by the housing crisis.

Given the profit-driven nature of real estate developers, cheap rental houses are often lacking in the market. Rental housing is also related to urban inequality. Discrimination may exist, as the dwelling owners may select renters (Ahmed & Hammarstedt, 2008). Similar to the housing market, the accessibility to various resources also plays a vital role in rental prices, which results in an uneven spatial pattern of rents (Li, Wei, Wu, & Tian, 2019b). More importantly, renters may not receive the same rights as homeowners. For example, renters in China may not have access to public schools and public housing because of the hukou system (Li, Wei, Yu, Tian, 2019). Rents in large cities tend to be high compared to income, especially in job-concentrated downtown areas, which may result in a new form of housing poverty (Sato, 2006). Li and Wei (2020) explore the patterns of rent stress in China and identify several critical determinants including policy, economic conditions, urban hierarchy, as well as north-south and rustbelt-sunbelt divisions (Liu et al., 2020).",

These programs tend to cover the people who are more vulnerable (Huang, 2012). However, in the U.S., illegal immigrants are suffering more from housing affordability problems (McConnell, 2013), but the lack of legal status may prevent them from getting housing assistance (McCarty & Siskin, 2004). There are similar situations in China, as many policies are only available to registered residents (local urban hukou holders), and government policies provide registered residents better accessibility, or lower barriers to get the benefits than migrants (Huang, 2012). Furthermore, these programs may not be welcomed by nearby communities because of \u201cnot in my back yard\u201d (NIMBY) effects (Nguyen et al., 2013). Combined with the fact that people relying on affordable housing usually have lower income and mobility, these people may get stuck in areas with less development, which can finally constrain their upward mobility (Verdugo, 2016).",

Many studies of racial residential segregation, especially in the U.S., are focused on the segregation of African Americans, which is still at a high level and is a comprehensive result of economic factors and preferences (Clark, 1986). Other studies also find that racial residential segregation varies among different ethnic backgrounds. For example, Mexican immigrants in the U.S. generally fit the trend described by the spatial assimilation model (Brown, 2007). Chinese immigrants, however, are more likely to fit the cultural preference model, although some of them are not pursuing residential assimilation, as Chinese immigrants still prefer to live among other Chinese (Yu & Myers, 2007).",

Income segregation results in severe problems when local governments highly depend on taxes to provide social welfare, public goods, and infrastructure (Ross, Houle, Dunn, & Aye, 2004). The rich may \u201cself-segregate\u201d thanks to their enhanced residential mobility (Reardon & Bischoff, 2011; Watson, 2009). Scholars have also begun to relate income segregation to other dimensions of urban inequality, such as spatial mismatch.

In addition, Florida and Mellander (2020) find that economic segregation impacts local innovation and economic performance, which may intensify regional inequality.",

The polarization of wages in labor markets between high- and low-skilled labor may result in skill-based residential segregation. Such segregation has negative effects on skill-based or knowledge-based urban growth. Except for the typical results of residential segregation such as limited access to job information and networks and low upward mobility, the isolation of low-skilled workers also decreases the productivity of high-skilled workers because they also have low accessibility to the services they demand (Li et al., 2013).",

In Western countries, scholars are mainly attracted to racial or socioeconomic spatial mismatch (Mclafferty & Preston, 1992; Ross, 1998). Although residential segregation is still one of the most important causes of spatial mismatch, it is not as pervasive as in the past. Nevertheless, the spatial mismatch level seems have not to have decreased in step with the decline of residential segregation, which suggests residential segregation is not the only cause of spatial mismatch.",

As population sprawls, people who cannot afford new suburban homes are remain in the old community. As employment sprawls, especially the service and manufacturing jobs which are suitable to poor and under-educated people, poor people who are trapped in urban centers and highly rely on public transportation facilities no longer have access to these jobs (Ding & Bingham, 2000; Glaeser & Kahn, 2001, p. 8117). Job decentralization also affects people's commuting time. In monocentric cities, decentralization can partly solve the traffic problem because people in the suburbs may have better accessibility to their jobs locally (Giuliano & Small, 1993; Gordon, Kumar, & Richardson, 1989). However, in a polycentric city, the complexity of urban spaces and unevenly distributed houses and job opportunities have significant negative effects on commuting time (Giuliano & Small, 1993), although others disagree (Veneri, 2010). Job opportunities and spatial mismatch in the context of polycentric development need further investigation.",

Evidence shows a higher asthma rate among low income and minority groups because of location of transportation facilities such as highways and rail stations (Garcia et al., 2013; Rosenbaum, 2016). Scholars have revealed that vehicles and other small sources of air pollution may contribute more than large pollutive facilities to health problems in poor neighborhoods. Busy roads produce both air pollution and noise, and the inverse-distance based relationship between busy roads and negative impacts on health has been uncovered (Stewart et al., 2014). Moreover, urban green space has been recognized as another important factor in environmental inequality and social justice (Whitehead, 2009; Wolch, Byrne, & Newell, 2014). Green spaces attract people to do more physical activities, and reduce local pollution (Wei et al., 2018; Wolch et al., 2014). Poor people usually have less access to urban green spaces for two reasons. First, they are trapped in urban centers, which are crowded and there is not enough available area for urban green spaces. Second, the region they live in may lack resources, and local government may not be able to maintain urban green spaces.",

The studies in this issue are based on a rich and diverse collection of source materials from North America, Europe, South America and China, advancing our understanding of the particularities and generalities of urban inequality. Together, the papers in this issue suggest that urban inequalities have been on the rise across the globe.",

First, the new economy is neither monolithic nor static. The rapid development of digital technologies implies that the working of the urban economy and the new division of labor is a moving target. For example, the uneven economic landscape of U.S. cities has been changing with technological progress and the rise of the network/platform economy. How these forces contribute to urban inequality and how to address arising urban problems remain challenging questions. More generally, theories of urban economic/income inequality in the context of rapid technological change are under-developed and are insufficient to examine emerging patterns of urban inequality (Huang & Wei, 2019). In particular, more research is needed on the significance of the growing segment of self-employed workers and the emergence of the gig economy. This category of workers is spread across different education levels and income classes but they probably share similar vulnerabilities at times of recession.",

More research is needed on housing in terms of spatiotemporal dynamics and inequality, including shifts from owner-occupied to rental housing. Conventional measures of housing inequality are especially problematic in international comparisons. For instance, substantial price ranges may indicate more choices of housing at a variety of prices or it can reflect considerable spatial segregation. In China, especially, underlying mechanisms of housing markets and affordability remain poorly understood. For example, the significance of subway stations for housing prices in China has a close relationship with the over-concentration of jobs and the poor housing affordability in urban centers (Li et al., 2019b). We need more comprehensive studies of housing markets, inequality, affordability, and change.",

This is partly a matter of defining high versus low incomes. In urban contexts, processes of segregation and gentrification tend to involve not the highest incomes (certainly not the infamous \u201c1 percent\u201d) but rather middle and upper-middle incomes and lower incomes, with the former as gentrifiers and the latter as displaced (also see Schlichtman & Patch, 2014). Moreover, for a substantial share of urban households, it is wealth and not just income that has become an increasingly important indicator of economic status, i.e., wealth expressed in home equity and retirement funds. Accordingly, the distinction between home-owners versus renters is increasingly significant, in cities around the world.",

The coronavirus pandemic was only underway for a couple of months at the time of writing (early March 2020) but it already pointed to the highly disparate vulnerabilities of different population groups, demographics, and occupational categories (e.g., Holpuch, 2020). In the new urban economy, homeless people, workers in the low-paid service sector, janitorial staff, hotel and restaurant workers, public transit workers, and those who cannot work from home, have compensated sick days or basic health insurance are among the most economically disadvantaged and most exposed to public health risks. Similar vulnerability differentials can be observed in regards to urban environmental threats and hazards, from hurricanes in Miami to air pollution in Delhi and urban heat waves in Tokyo.",

The notion of urban \u2018syndemics\u2019 (Singer, Bulled, Ostrach, & Mendenhall, 2017) can be used to indicate the spatial convergence of an array of conditions that define well-being and inequality: problems of, for example, unemployment, low incomes, poor health, low education, and lack of access to amenities, food, and urban services, often are concentrated in space but it is hard to identify the key drivers of such processes. Emergent approaches in data analytics and urban policy analytics rely on potentially rich data sources to study the multiple dimensions of urban inequality, and the development of data science and GIS can provide powerful tools to increase our understanding. In the meantime, any progress in our understanding of the nature of present-day inequalities requires close attention to their urban spatial dynamics, across the globe.",
