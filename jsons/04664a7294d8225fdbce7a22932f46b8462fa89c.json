Eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is still challenging even if interferon-(IFN-) free regimens with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV-infected individuals are available in clinical practice. IFNL4 is a newly described protein, associated with human antiviral defenses. We investigated whether IFNL4 ss469415590 variant has an effect on the prediction of treatment response in HCV-infected patients treated with IFN-including regimens. Patients and Methods. In all, 185 patients infected with HCV genotype 1 treated with peg-IFN plus ribavirin, with or without telaprevir, were genotyped for IFNL4 ss469415590. We retrospectively investigated whether the role of IFNL4 ss469415590 variant and other factors could predict sustained virological response (SVR) in Japanese patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Results. There were 65.7%, 31.5%, and 2.8% patients in the IFNL4 ss469415590 TT/TT, TT/-G, and -G/-G groups, respectively. SVR rates were 82.1% or 49.3% in patients treated with peg-IFN plus ribavirin with or without telaprevir, respectively. IFNL4 ss469415590 variant and HCV viral loads or IFNL4 ss469415590 variant and early virological response were better predictors of SVR in patients treated with peg-IFN plus ribavirin with or without telaprevir, respectively. Conclusion. In the era of DAAs, measurement of IFNL4 ss469415590 variant could help the prediction of SVR in Japanese HCV genotype 1 infected individuals treated with IFN-including regimens.",

We also reported that IFNL3 rs8099917 was useful for the prediction of SVR in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 [9] . However, the mechanism between IFNL3 and clearance of HCV has been unclear despite the extensive work [10] [11] [12] . We also reported that IFNL3 induces IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as IFN--inducible protein (IP-10) that are reportedly associated with the progression of HCV-related pathogenesis and antiviral activities against HCV [12] .",

Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chiba University, School of Medicine (number 428). All patients were of Asian origin and infected with HCV genotype 1. They underwent standard antiviral therapy with the combination of peg-IFN plus ribavirin [4] or telaprevir with peg-IFN plus ribavirin [17, 18] . HCV RNA was measured at baseline, at weeks 4 and 12, at the end of treatment, and at 24 weeks after the end of treatment. SVR was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the end of treatment. Patients with undetectable HCV RNA at 4 and 12 weeks after the commencement of treatment were considered to have had rapid virological response (RVR) and early virological response (EVR), respectively [19] . Relapse was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment, but it reappeared after the end of treatment [20] . Null response was defined as less than 2 log 10 decrease in HCV RNA (IU/mL) from baseline after 12 weeks of therapy [20] .",

The beneficial insertion ss469415590-TT allele could abrogate IFNL4. IFNL4 signaling via IFN receptor could regulate antiviral activity against coronaviruses as well as HCV [26] . Manuel et al. [27] also reported that polymorphisms in the IFNL3/4 region influence susceptibility to CMV replication Our results indicated that IFNL4 ss469415590 variant is useful for prediction of the treatment response to IFNincluding regimens. A recent study [28] showed that IFNL4 ss469415590 minor genotype was associated with slower early viral decay, due to slower loss of free virus and decreased drug efficacy in patients treated with the DAA sofosbuvir against HCV NS5B, along with RBV, suggesting that IFNL4 variant might be useful in the DAA era. In IFN-free DAA therapies, it is unclear whether these variants play a role or not, although it is possible that certain DAAs could have effects on IFN signaling such as ISGs of host cells.",
