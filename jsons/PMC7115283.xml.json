An extension of our study of nursing students would be to conduct a study among nurses at agencies where students have clinical experiences. Such a study could assess the agencies' infection control outcomes as well as changes in behavior among the nurses who collaborate with students. Because others have described the dissonance between theory and practice, we hypothesize that change can begin from the bottom up: from novice to expert. In developing countries, where physical resources are limited, educated professionals can override habitual poor practice. Research is best used as a tool for positive change.",
