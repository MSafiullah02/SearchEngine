However, most studies did not include respiratory viruses beyond RSV and the majority did not report beyond the first few months of life. The proportion of RVIs in our inpatient predischarge setting of 1.7% was much lower than the 4%-52% incidence reported in other NICU studies [6, 15, 22] . The higher incidence in previous studies is likely due to the differences in study design, where these studies performed periodic surveillance testing for RVI. Our study included only symptomatic infants with an RVI during their admission. This approach may have missed infants with mild symptoms or who were asymptomatic. Furthermore, differences in testing methodology such as primary usage of multiplex PCR may account for the differences in incidence. Our lower RVI rate could also possibly be attributable to the strict enforcement of infection control policies in our department, which are similar to those in published infection prevention guidelines [17, 23] . Even so, guidelines specific to the neonatal setting is lacking and the effectiveness of most interventions has not been systematically studied. Differences in testing strategy and laboratory methodology also likely accounted for the lack of viral codetection in our study, which has been reported in other pediatric studies [4, 6, 24] .
