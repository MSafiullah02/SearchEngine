More and more workers will come back to Guangdong province from other provinces. Thereby, we choose Guangdong province as a case study to explore the effects of the population migration and quarantine strategies on the COVID-19 variations.

For Sce 4, Sce 5, Sce 7 and Sce 8, compared with the baseline results, the DDE of these scenarios are 81 days (i.e. Apr 16, 2020), 59 days (i.e. Mar 25, 2020), 83 days (i.e. Apr 18, 2020) and 73 days (i.e. Apr 8, 2020), respectively which indicate the early extinction of COVID-19 (STable 1). The MVCCC of the four scenarios are larger than the baseline result with the largest value (1448) in Sce: 8 (Fig. 3A , STable 1). For the confirmed cases, these scenarios are similar as these of the baseline results (Fig. 4A , STable 1). For Sce 3: (p 2 , A) = (1.5p 2 * , A *) and Sce 6: (p 2 , A) = (2p 2 * , A *), the increased percentage of the exposed individuals only impacted the number of the cumulative confirmed cases with the values of 1422 and 1447, and the corresponding DDE have only small changes with 105 days for Sce 3 and 107 days for Sce 6 (Fig. 3A, STable 1) .

From the above analysis, it can be concluded that the increased numbers of the input population can mainly shorten the disease extinction days and the increased percentages of the exposed individuals of the input population increase the number of cumulative confirmed cases at a small percentage. Both the increased input population and the increased exposed individuals have no impacts on the peak values and peak value times of the confirmed cases.",
