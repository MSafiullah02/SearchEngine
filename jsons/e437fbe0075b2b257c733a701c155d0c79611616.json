            "text": "We would like to express our concern about kidney transplant programmes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although we recognise the importance of kidney transplants for dialysis patients, we cannot ignore the potential safety issues during this pandemic. The limited accuracy of the RT-PCR test might lead to underdiagnosis of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Weaknesses in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified in the pre-analytical phase (ie, collection, handling, transport and storage, and timing of the test) and in the analytical phase (ie, viral recombination, assay quality, harmonisation, and instrument perform ance). 1 All these issues could result in a high risk of false-negative test results. 2 Additionally, a Chinese study of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection reported positive RT-PCR assays in only 601 (59\u00b73%) of 1014 patients with suspected infection. 3 Among the 308 patients with baseline negative RT-PCR, 147 (47\u00b77%) were reconsidered after the test as highly probable cases, and 103 (33\u00b74%) as probable cases (based on symptoms, CT scan, and subsequent swab test), whereas only 58 (18\u00b78%) patients were regarded as true negative cases. This high rate of negative results from RT-PCR in patients with radiological features typical of SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection raises doubts about test sensitivity in patients with no symptoms. Furthermore, the greatest likelihood of false-negative results was reported to be 5-7 days before onset of symptoms. 1 With regard to transplant procedures, SARS-CoV-2 infection could be missed in both donors and recipients who are asymptomatic owing to the sensitivity issues with the RT-PCR test. RT-PCR with bronchoalveolar lavage in the donor might improve the accuracy of the test; however, this procedure would not be applicable to the recipient. The short time interval from notification that a kidney transplant can take place to the surgical procedure does not permit a test in the recipient. Furthermore, we do not have data on the sensitivity of multiple RT-PCR tests or RT-PCR tests with bronchoalveolar lavage in asymptomatic individuals. Additionally, in the immediate postoperative period and after hospital discharge, transplanted patients have increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to induction therapy and immunosuppressive treatment.",

            "text": "In our opinion, insufficient evidence is available to consider kidney transplantation as a safe procedure in COVID-19 pandemic areas. In emergency situations-eg, in cases of no vascular access, unfeasible dialysis, or a hyperimmune state-the benefits might outweigh the risks of a kidney transplant. Therefore, decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, with concerns shared among the transplant team and patient after careful assessment of the risks and benefits. A pressing need exists to evaluate possible solutions to reduce the risk of kidney transplantation procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for research to address the sensitivity issues of diagnostic tests for COVID-19. In the meantime, each case should be carefully discussed and scrutinised by the entire transplant team, and a dedicated consent form would help patients to make well informed decisions.",
