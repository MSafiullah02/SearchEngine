In a relatively short period of time, the life sciences have evolved from a simple cataloguing exercise of the diversity of nature to a position in which researchers are adding to that diversity through the construction of modified and potentially novel life-forms. The vast majority of this activity has had a positive impact on the quality of life of at least some of the human race. Indeed, the past 150 years have seen major advances in the fields of microbiology and biochemistry, and these have been followed by the emergence of the disciplines of immunology, molecular biology, and genetics. In practical terms, this has resulted in the introduction of sewers and clean water, the development of antibiotics and vaccines capable of eliminating infectious diseases such as smallpox, and the ability to create genetically modified organisms able to synthesize production-scale quantities of human hormones such as insulin.",

Some of these species have transitioned from the confines of the laboratory into mainstream agriculture in countries such as the United States and India.

Although the validity of this argument is debatable, it is also extremely unlikely that the average research scientist will have more than a hazy comprehension of the factors important in developing an effective bioweapon.

As a consequence, this perceived lack of openness has created an atmosphere of suspicion in which conspiracy theorists, the media, and Hollywood thrive, routinely conjuring up lurid images of evil scientists working on government-funded Frankenstein projects to destroy the world.

There were no fatalities in New Zealand (only two people were admitted to hospital in the immediate aftermath), and there have been no epidemics, despite disruption of sewage and water supply systems. This contrasts with a high initial death toll (230 000), many injuries (300 000), catastrophic disruption of Haitian society (1 million people made homeless), and an epidemic of cholera in the displaced population. Aspects of a society that determine its resilience to major disasters include the general health and education of its population, its technological infrastructure, the state of readiness of its societal organization to respond to the event concerned, and its political and governance structures.

Thus, frequent but relatively mild infections (e.g., the common cold) may inflict a significant overall burden on a society in terms of general ill-health, use of health services, and loss of economic activity without arousing much outcry from the general population. In contrast, a rare but severe treatable infection such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus may cause much consternation in the media but actually inflict a much smaller overall burden on society. Novel or emerging infections (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and swine flu) may have major economic and societal impacts worldwide, with an actual disease burden that is a minute fraction of that caused by well-known diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.",

By extension, an unknown infection can cause disproportionate fear in a population, exaggeration by the media, and the risk of overreaction by the authorities. The 2001 anthrax letters episode in the United States was an example of a major response to a relatively small overall disease burden (20 infected and 5 deaths in a country of 311 million people), but it demonstrates the fact that a society\u2019s response to an unexpected human-originated event may have a much greater impact on the society than the event itself.

Fortunately, escape of infectious material from laboratories is very rare; examples include a smallpox outbreak in Birmingham in 1978 and the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak associated with faulty drainage at the animal health facility at Pirbright in 2007. The root cause of such accidental releases was a breakdown in containment (the physical control measures put in place to prevent microorganisms escaping to the environment). In fact, containment technology and practices have improved dramatically during the past 50 years, with significant improvements often being identified by analysis of accidents or near-misses. At the Porton Down site, which houses both Ministry of Defence and Department of Health microbiological containment laboratories, there have been only two cases of laboratory-acquired infection; these occurred in the 1960s and both were the basis for considerable improvements in procedures. In the United Kingdom, there have been no known deliberate releases of biological material.

These risks were calculated retrospectively from the reported causes of death during that year. The risk of dying in England and Wales from infection due to bioterrorism in that year was zero (as it was in 2009). However, when looking forward into an uncertain future, many more factors than likelihood affect the perception of threat, and it may be that the very rarity of an event adds to its perceived impact, making it more interesting to society at large and therefore much discussed in the media.

These principles actually apply more widely to other human activities, including hygienic preparation of food, supply of clean drinking water, safe processing of sewage, sterile procedures in surgery, and safe operation of hospital microbiology laboratories, as well as the more obvious situations of microbiological research laboratories.

Indeed, there is evidence that this impression may be imprinted in childhood and once established is difficult to modify. The reasons for this stereotyping are complex but can be broken down into two main areas: a failure to grasp the nature of the scientific process on the part of the public (education) and a failure to present their message in an accessible manner on the part of scientists (communication).

Indeed, it has been suggested that the entertainment industry (e.g., the popular X-Files series) is partially responsible for the large numbers of people who now believe in astrology, ESP, alien abductions, and other forms of pseudoscience that contribute to the scientific illiteracy of the public. Against such a cultural backdrop, it is not surprising that the public has little problem in believing that government scientists employed in defense-related research are not to be trusted. As a consequence, scientists, particularly those engaged in research considered dual use, find themselves in an almost impossible position when trying to explain their research and allay understandable fears harbored by the public.",

            "text": "So why are members of the public concerned about research sponsored by the defense community? Many nations view research into the development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) against biowarfare agents as an essential element of risk reduction. Although civilian and military populations are equally susceptible to the same biological agents, the relative risk of exposure differs markedly. Thus, although there is considerable commonality in the research priorities of each group, some biological threats, such as anthrax and plague, are currently seen as being more relevant to the military. In addition, the nature of the work undertaken by the military and the environment in which it operates are likely to influence how and when MCMs are administered. For example, the military may consider immunizing troops with a new vaccine prior to deployment as the most effective means of protecting individuals and ensuring operational effectiveness in a high-risk environment. In contrast, the civilian authorities are more likely to treat with antibiotics after an outbreak has occurred rather than vaccinate large numbers of the public against a disease with a very low likelihood of a deliberate release (albeit very high impact), such as anthrax.",

To develop MCMs capable of dealing with biothreat agents such as anthrax, there is inevitably a requirement to handle and manipulate these dangerous pathogens, which in turn generates concerns, rightly or wrongly, about the possibility of their inadvertent release or potential misuse (dual use). Indeed, these concerns derive partly from the fact that the government-sponsored organizations currently developing defensive MCMs were engaged many decades earlier in the development of offensive biological weapons. Although this research was discontinued in the 1960s in the United Kingdom, there are still concerns, in some quarters at least, regarding the potential for this type of work to be resurrected. When the public\u2019s mistrust of politicians and scientists is added to this mix, it is not difficult to understand why people are willing to believe the worst.",

The nature of modern research is such that it is rare to find a project that does not require collaboration with academic and/or industry-based partners, thus ensuring at least some degree of scientific visibility. In addition, the regular inspection of defense research facilities by national regulatory agencies or under the auspices of international treaties is an attempt to alleviate some concerns.

This is particularly important given that any new MCM must first undergo clinical trials in human volunteers to demonstrate both safety and efficacy. This will require the exposure of healthy individuals to an experimental treatment that carries with it the risk of adverse reactions. Given that this is a man-made risk, how can this be justified? Fortunately, in countries such as the United Kingdom, these decisions are taken out of the hand of the defense scientists. Indeed, investigators conducting clinical trials need to justify their study to an independent research ethics committee, which determines if any potential health risks to trial participants are justified. A key element in the committee\u2019s deliberations is to determine if there is a real-world justification for the new MCM; thus, the committee represents an important reality check. Once the study has received approval, it is subjected to further scrutiny at the national level in the United Kingdom by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Each of these layers of control has the power to stop a clinical trial if it is concerned that an ethical breach has occurred and thus plays a key role in preventing inappropriate research.",

Drug companies are focused on making money and given the relatively small size of the military market will only invest significantly in the development of MCMs that could also be used to protect civilian populations. Thus, any MCM derived from military research will undergo intensive public scrutiny on route to being licensed and, as a consequence, will be exposed to intense public and financial scrutiny.",

In the United Kingdom, the vast majority of microbiological research is performed in civilian organizations, with only a very small fraction being conducted by defense laboratories. Research activities in defense and civilian facilities in the United Kingdom are carefully regulated by a number of statutory bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive, which monitors studies involving genetically modified organisms, and the Home Office, which oversees experiments involving animals. Clinical trials involving human volunteers are regulated by the MHRA and are overseen by research ethics committees (which are themselves approved by the UK Ethics Committee Authority). However, more regulations, such as intrusive psychological profiling of staff working in microbiological laboratories or heavy-handed, overbearing, rigid assessment programs of scientific staff to \u2018ensure\u2019 reliability, are unlikely to further reduce the probability of an already extremely unlikely event. Rather, they are more likely to alienate well-motivated staff, thereby stifling research and the development of products and techniques that could bring major benefits to the United Kingdom and humanity as a whole. Indeed, fostering a supportive community among well-rewarded and appreciated scientists and staff would make it much easier to detect early signs of unhappiness, social problems, or the unacceptable behavior of individual researchers.
