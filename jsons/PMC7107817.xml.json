Physical examination revealed only mild respiratory distress. Findings on a chest radiogram were normal, as were the WBC count and the C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels. Bronchiolitis was diagnosed, and the patient did not receive antibiotics. Progressive respiratory failure developed during the 12 h after admission, and the patient required nasal oxygenation. While a physical examination was being performed by a physician, the patient experienced cardiac arrest. Resuscitation measures, including oral intubation, oxygenation, bag-valve-mask ventilation, chest compression, and intravenous administration of adrenaline, were immediately performed and were continued for 1 h, without success. It was notable that blood flow from the trachea was observed during intubation. Repeated oral and tracheal suction was performed. Because the resuscitation took place in the general pediatric ward, health care workers participating in the resuscitation did not wear any protection, such as a facial mask and gloves. A necropsy was performed, and the findings revealed right lobar pneumonia with a necrotizing hemorrhage of the entire right lung and one-half of the left lung. A culture specimen from tracheal aspirates grew methicillin-susceptible S. aureus.",

Previous studies have reported transmission of different pathogens during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation: Salmonella [5], Herpes simplex [6], Helicobacter pylori [7], and more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [8]. In the present case, it is likely that transmission was related to the events leading up to intubation, and contact, droplet, or airborne transmission might have occurred. The transmission might have been promoted by the particular pathogenicity of PVL-producing strain. The transmission of the S. aureus strain to the physician was revealed by furunculosis. As previously reported, most cases of furunculosis (93%) are due to PVL-producing S. aureus [1]. Unfortunately, no nasal sample was obtained from this physician. This study highlights the necessity for health care workers to protect themselves against transmission of pathogens from patient to care giver, even in situations where benign infection is suspected.",
