This training consists of a pre-simulation home visit to a patient with a recent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, a simulated patient (SP) encounter, and an extended medical educator-led debriefing session with all participants of the encounter, including the SP. The training includes the technical aspects of managing diabetes, such as the clinical features and diet, but has an emphasis on developing the essential verbal and non-verbal communication skills required to facilitate the empowerment of patient adherence to management plans.
