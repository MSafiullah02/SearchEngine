After having been an assistant professor of internal medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou College (China) from 1988 to 1991, he moved to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (USA) where he has successively worked as a research associate, instructor and assistant professor at the Department of Pathology. Since 2007, he occupies the position of an associate professor in this department. Dr. Huang's studies focus on the molecular disease mechanisms of Trypanosoma cruzi and the genetic manipulation of the parasite. He made substantial contributions to the research on Chagasic cardiomyopathy, cAMP-signaling and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) in T. cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii.\n\n",

To overcome this obstacle, we sought to develop a new method to prevent persistence, based on the introduction of an inducible detrimental/toxic gene into T. cruzi, which results in killing the organism upon the induction of the detrimental/toxic gene. Such an inducible strain could be useful as a vaccine to induce protective immunity. Once a protective immune response is present, any latent parasites could be eliminated by inducing the detrimental/toxic gene, producing a \u201csterile\u201d immunity. The system we have developed can be used in any strain of T. cruzi (including field isolates) allowing this approach to create multiple vaccine strains.2.\nWhat was your first reaction when you faced the results?

However, we also unexpectedly made a discovery when we tested whether the DDD system could be regulated to stabilize fusion proteins in intracellular amastigotes. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with pTREX-GFP-DDDHA strain and in absence of induction, amastigotes were replicating inside the host cells normally. Then, 250 nM TMP-lactate was added to the culture medium to induce GFP-DDDHA stabilization, which resulted in intracellular amastigote death. The DDDHA peptide is detrimental to intracellular amastigotes.3.\nHow will the project go on?\n\n",

The transgenic strains were attenuated in mouse experiments producing no pathological changes and inoculation with these DDDHA strains in mice provided strong protection against lethal wild type infection.
