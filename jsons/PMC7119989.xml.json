As a modified form of cardiopulmonary bypass, modern-day ECMO circuitry utilizes either a semi-occlusive roller pump or a centrifugal pump combined with a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator for gas exchange. As a supportive modality, ECMO can provide extended physiologic respiratory and cardiac support for days to weeks, thereby allowing the clinical team time to diagnose and treat the patient\u2019s underlying disease process. To date, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry contains more than 87,000 ECMO runs in its history, of which approximately 10% are children supported for a pulmonary indication [1].",

For neonates with refractory respiratory failure, clinical trials have shown that ECMO decreases mortality and is cost-effective [2\u20134]. Likewise, ECMO has been demonstrated to be a valid treatment option for critically ill adults with refractory respiratory failure, [5] yet no clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of ECMO have been performed for children with respiratory failure. Current evidence for use of ECMO for children with respiratory failure relies mostly on registry reports and single-center experiences. A recent secondary analysis of the RESTORE trial [6] utilizing matching techniques to compare patients who did and did not receive ECMO showed no mortality benefit from ECMO as compared to ventilation management strategies [7]. This report, while thought provoking, was a secondary analysis of a study designed to evaluate a nurse-driven sedation protocol, and thus the results should be interpreted with caution. Examining ECMO in children with respiratory failure is further limited by the heterogeneity of this patient population; variations in patient age, disease processes, and patient comorbidities all contribute to this heterogeneity. Lastly, the clinical management of ECMO varies greatly across pediatric centers.",

            "text": "Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (pARDS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by decreased lung compliance and difficulties with oxygenation. Mortality from pARDS ranges from 18% to 35% [10, 11]. Clinical predictors of mortality from pARDS could help clinicians identify children who would benefit from ECMO support for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. Candidate predictors include alveolar dead space fraction (utilized in the studies below as [PaCO2 \u2013 end tidal CO2]/PaCO2), the PaO2/FiO2, and the oxygenation index (OI). Nuckton et al. prospectively measured dead space fraction in adult patients with ARDS early in the course of their illness and found increasing dead space fraction to be an independent risk factor for mortality [12]. From a pediatric perspective, in a retrospective review of 217 children requiring mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, the dead space fraction at disease onset and day one both correlated with mortality, though not independently associated when controlled for severity of illness, 24-h maximal inotrope score, and oxygenation index [13]. On the other hand, in a cohort of 266 children with pARDS, Yehya et al. recently showed that the alveolar dead space fraction at the onset of pARDS was significantly higher in non-survivors (0.31 vs 0.13), was independently associated with mortality, and functioned better as a predictor of mortality than the initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio or oxygenation index [14]. This predictive value of dead space fraction however was not observed at 24 h. Functionally, a single numerical value at disease onset may not be practical from the standpoint of clinical decision-making, as intensivists may attempt other modalities and therapies (e.g., high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, prone position, inhaled nitric oxide, etc.) before proceeding with ECMO.",

Over the past decade, many retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated an association between higher OI and mortality in children with hypoxemic respiratory failure [16\u201319]. Historically, an OI of greater than 20 has been used as an indication to transition from conventional mechanical ventilation to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) [20, 21]. In these studies, an OI greater than 20 is associated with mortality rates of more than 40%. The trend in OI value is likely more informative than any single data point, as pARDS is an evolving disease process. For example, utilizing data from preexisting cohorts with pARDS, the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference evaluated the following variables as predictors of mortality: initial PF ratio, initial OI, worst PF ratio during the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation, and worst OI values during the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation. The worst (highest) OI value during the first 3 days of ventilation was the best discriminator for non-survival, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 [15]. Recent data suggests that incorporating an inflammatory cytokine profile alongside the oxygenation index is superior in predicting outcomes in pARDS compared to the oxygenation index alone [22]. These data are intriguing, as they suggest the possibility of a future biomarker array that could help identify patients with pARDS at risk for mortality and thus stratify those candidates who should be considered for earlier ECMO support. Until then, it can be concluded that for patients with pARDS that progress to ECMO, higher pre-ECMO oxygenation index is at higher risk of mortality [23, 24].",

For example, in an analysis of a cohort of children in our institution with hypoxemic respiratory failure who were ventilated with HFOV, an OI greater than 25 at 48 h following the onset of pARDS conferred a significantly higher odds of mortality (odds ratio: 5, 95% CI 1.3 to 16.7, p < 0.05) [19].

            "text": "In the absence of strict numerical criteria surrounding oxygenation, intensivists are left to rely on the gestalt clinical picture when deciding upon the initiation of ECMO to support children with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Key components within this framework include trends in ventilator support and oxygenation measures over time, hemodynamic stability, organ function, and acid-base status. First, with regard to the trajectory of respiratory support and oxygenation, serial assessments serve more valuable than an evaluation at a single time point [26]. It is our practice to obtain arterial blood gases and calculate the oxygenation index every 4 h. Concurrently, we also track trends in peak inspiratory pressures as a marker for the potential of evolving ventilator-induced lung injury. Second, children with evolving hypoxemic respiratory failure can develop hemodynamic instability. Etiologies for this instability can be multifactorial, including impaired oxygen delivery to the myocardium, impaired right ventricular preload from increased intrathoracic pressure, increased right ventricular afterload from hypercarbia and acidosis, and concurrent sepsis. Next, the cascade of inflammatory cytokines released during ARDS as well as with VILI has been demonstrated to result in direct organ dysfunction, fluid retention, and subsequent fluid overload [27]. All of the above factors may culminate in a progressive metabolic acidosis, the effect of which is noteworthy in critically ill children. In a retrospective cohort of children with hypoxemic respiratory failure supported with HFOV, the presence of a metabolic acidosis was independently associated with a higher risk of mortality [19]. Likewise, studies examining pre-ECMO variables in this patient population have shown that the presence of acidosis is associated with worse survival [23, 24]. For example, in a study by Dimico and colleagues containing data from 1325 children within the ELSO registry, odds of survival to hospital discharged increased by 15% for every 0.1 increase in pre-ECMO pH.",

            "text": "Though severe refractory hypoxemia is the most common indication for pediatric respiratory ECMO, there are patients who require ECMO due to severe ventilation impairment leading to hypercarbia. Acute hypercarbic respiratory failure is defined as a PaCO2 greater than 50 mmHg, typically associated with respiratory acidosis. Modern ventilation strategies are focused on limiting VILI and allowing for permissive hypercarbia [28, 29]. The possible detrimental effects of moderate hypercarbia (50\u201375 mmHg) have been debated, but they are inconsequential compared to the risks associated with ECMO [30]. Thus, ECMO is not advised for moderate hypercarbia (i.e., PaCO2 up to 75 mmHg). However, as PaCO2 rises and respiratory acidosis becomes more severe, dysfunction of other organ systems becomes more significant, particularly that of the cardiovascular system. Therefore, severe hypercarbic respiratory failure with acidosis and hemodynamic instability is an indication for initiation of ECMO [30]. ECMO can correct hypercarbia rapidly with a resultant improvement in acidosis and organ function. During this process, clinicians must be aware of possible detrimental consequences of rapid correction of PaCO2, which includes cerebral vasoconstriction and the development of alkalosis.",

There has been debate if patients with CF are candidates for ECMO due to the progressive nature of their disease. Each patient must be evaluated individually. First, the reversibility of their respiratory failure should be assessed. The primary determination in this regard is if the child has a pulmonary infection that is potentially amenable to antibiotic therapy. If lung disease is not thought to be reversible, then candidacy for lung transplantation should be considered. Cystic fibrosis should only be considered an absolute contraindication to ECMO if the patient is deemed not to have the potential for recovery from the acute process and is not a candidate for lung transplantation. Candidacy should be considered for any intubated cystic fibrosis patient to help inform decisions of whether or not to pursue ECMO. This candidacy should be determined by working with your local pulmonologist and, if necessary, a regional lung transplant center.",

            "text": "Over the past two decades, the overall survival for children with pertussis who are supported with ECMO is 39%, considerably lower as compared to children requiring ECMO for other viral and bacterial etiologies [24]. In a retrospective analysis, children with pertussis who survived their ECMO course were found to have higher pre-ECMO PEEP (11 cmH2O vs. 7 cmH2O, p = 0.006) and significantly higher pre-ECMO pH values (7.31 vs. 7.14, p 0.002) when compared to non-survivors [46]. Lung pathology obtained from young infants who died from fulminant pertussis shows necrotizing bronchiolitis with necrosis of the alveolar epithelium [47]; thus, an open-lung strategy achieved with high PEEP (i.e., 10\u201311 mmHg) may help to offset the pathophysiologic ramifications of this process. Refractory pulmonary hypertension and severe leukocytosis are two additional pathophysiologic mechanisms which contribute to the severity of fulminant pertussis infections. Significantly leukocytosis is observed in infants with the most severe infections, with white blood cell (WBC) counts in excess of 100,000/mm3 associated with increased mortality risk [48]. Postmortem examinations of these patients show leukocytes obstructing the pulmonary blood vessels [47]. This severe leukocytosis leads to vascular hyperviscosity and pulmonary arteriole thromboses and, when combined with the reactive pulmonary vasculature of the young infant, pulmonary hypertension refractory to conventional therapy. Given the role of leukocytosis in the pathology of this disease, an interesting single-center case series explored the utility of leukodepletion in infants with fulminant pertussis [49]. Implementation of a clinical protocol for leukodepletion for children with WBC count of greater than 50,000/mm3 resulted in improved survival, with a reduction in mortality from 44% to 10%. Leukofiltration for patients receiving ECMO support was accomplished by placing a WBC filter sited in the bridge of the ECMO circuit. While this report was a single-center study with a small volume of patients, a case-mix adjustment accounting for age, WBC count, and ECMO referral time revealed a significantly better observed mortality following the implementation of leukodepletion than predicted. Thus, while the prognosis for infants with fulminant pertussis requiring ECMO remains guarded, implementation of leukodepletion can be considered to help offset the pathologic consequences of severe leukocytosis and subsequent pulmonary hypertension.",

Similarly, the presence of a fungal infection did not lead to an increase in circuit complications or circuit failure. Thus, the authors of this review concluded that while a fungal infection remains an important comorbidity to consider when initiating ECMO support, it, in and of itself, should not be considered an absolute contraindication to ECLS. However, caution must be exercised for pediatric patients with respiratory failure secondary to fungal infections. In the aforementioned review by Zabrocki et al., fungal pneumonia was the single diagnosis independently associated with the highest risk of mortality [24]. It is likely that the fungal infection alone does not portend to a grim prognosis but rather is a surrogate marker for patients with other diagnoses associated with poor outcomes on ECMO, such as patients with oncological diagnoses.",

MRSA pneumonia and sepsis may result in thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (TAMOF), and there is some evidence which shows benefit from plasmapheresis performed during ECMO to reverse the sequelae of this disorder [55]. Combining plasmapheresis to the ECMO circuit adds a layer of technical complexity, and there is also increased heparin clearance during the procedure, thus necessitating careful monitoring of anticoagulation. Despite these challenges, recent data have shown that therapeutic plasma exchange can improve organ function in children with sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction who require ECMO support [56].",

In this era, lung-protective ventilator strategies had not yet become standard practice, and, perhaps, significant VILI that had accrued in these children prior to ECMO initiation was irreversible. More contemporary data suggests that the optimal timing for ECMO initiation still lies within the first week of mechanical ventilation [59\u201361], but outcomes for children ventilated beyond 7 days prior to ECMO have improved such that these children should still be considered appropriate candidates for extracorporeal support. Domico et al. reviewed the relationship of pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation duration and the outcomes of 1352 pediatric patients who required ECMO for respiratory failure from 1999 to 2008 [23]. In this analysis, a significant reduction in survival was not observed until the pre-ECMO duration of ventilation exceeded 14 days. Similarly, in Zabrocki\u2019s review of pediatric respiratory failure, analysis of pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation revealed that survival remained 56% or higher for children who had ECMO initiated within the first 14 days of mechanical ventilation but declined to 38% beyond this timeframe [24]. Fourteen days is now often considered a \u201ccutoff\u201d for duration of ventilation prior to ECMO; however, the outcomes for patients with certain diagnoses, such as viral pneumonia, can be good even when ECMO is initiated after 2 weeks of ventilation [21, 22]. Careful patient selection is therefore paramount to successful use of when ECMO if extracorporeal support is initiated after an extended course of mechanical ventilation. Factors that should be considered are the number of comorbidities, the number of non-pulmonary organ failures, and the primary cause of pARDS.",

Closely related to acute kidney injury is fluid overload, which also impacts ECMO patient outcomes. In a recent analysis of 756 neonatal and pediatric ECMO patients, peak fluid overload, fluid overload at ECMO discontinuation, and the change in fluid overload during ECMO were significantly higher in patients who suffered mortality either while on ECMO or later during their hospitalization [63].",

Overall survival to hospital discharge was 35% (36% for respiratory failure, 29% for cardiac failure), which is worse than for other children receiving ECLS. Despite their immunosuppressed state, only 19% of these children acquired a new infection while on ECMO. Children with malignancies did have a higher rate of hemorrhagic complications, including cannula site bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and CNS hemorrhages when compared to children without cancer. Currently, most pediatric ECMO centers offer ECMO support for this patient population. Of 118 centers surveyed, 78% did not view the presence of a malignancy as a contraindication, and 17% considered pediatric cancer as only a relative contraindication to ECMO [64]. The support for the use of ECMO in this patient population, despite only a 35% overall survival, likely stems from the notion that these patients, the majority of whom have leukemia, have a good prognosis with regard to their underlying malignancy if their acute respiratory failure can be overcome. In this cohort, the median OI prior to initiation of ECMO was 52, reflecting that these patients likely have a higher degree of lung injury prior to ECMO initiation, relative to other patient populations. It remains to be seen if earlier initiation of ECMO within this patient population could potentially result in improved outcomes. Regardless, malignancy should not be considered an absolute contraindication from ECMO. Close communication with the child\u2019s oncology team regarding the long-term prognosis from their underlying malignancy is an additional essential piece of information to be considered in this decision-making process.",

            "text": "Children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are another immunosuppressed patient population where the decision to implement extracorporeal support may be controversial. These children can develop life-threatening complications in the immediate posttransplant period (e.g., diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, idiopathic pulmonary syndrome, various infections) and in the later stages following transplantation (e.g., graft versus host disease, bronchiolitis obliterans), all of which can lead to respiratory failure refractory to conventional care. Historical mortality rates for children requiring mechanical ventilation following HSCT are well over 50% [65\u201367]. More recent data suggests that an earlier transition from conventional ventilation to HFOV may improve survival, but mortality remains high [68]. With regard to the use of ECMO in this patient population, there are sparse case reports documenting the successful use of ECMO to support HSCT patients through posttransplant complications, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, [69] idiopathic pulmonary syndrome, [70] and sepsis secondary to neutropenic enterocolitis [71]. However, in an ELSO registry review of 19 children undergoing ECLS following HSCT, 79% died during the ECMO course: seven developed multiorgan failure, three had refractory hemorrhage, and five had support was withdrawn for others reasons [72]. Furthermore, only one of the four remaining children alive after ECMO survived to hospital discharge. A more recent ELSO registry review of children placed on ECMO support following hematopoietic stem cell transplant also showed poor outcomes, with only 10% of patients surviving to hospital discharge [73]. Based on this experience, it can be concluded that, at the present time, children undergoing HSCT are unlikely to survive refractory respiratory failure requiring ECMO. Broadly speaking, this population of children has had dismal outcomes when requiring intensive care admission, particularly if mechanical ventilation is necessary, and thus ECMO should be avoided.",

This level of PEEP in the setting of pARDS will frequently lead to total lung collapse and the need for re-recruitment of the lung later in the ECMO course. The need for re-recruitment may prolong the ECMO course and contribute to VILI. Given this concern, some intensivists no longer practice strict \u201clung rest\u201d while on ECMO for ARDS [90].

            "text": "While attempting aggressive lung recruitment in the acute inflammatory stage of ARDS is discouraged, as it can exacerbate VILI, maintaining lung recruitment with relatively high MAwP while on ECMO may be advisable. On conventional ventilation, this goal is achieved by maintaining high PEEP with a long inspiratory time. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) is a mode of ventilation, which utilizes a high distending pressure with brief intermittent releases of pressure to improve ventilation, and patients are able to spontaneously breathing during the periods of high distending pressure [92]. APRV can also be used to achieve a high MAwP without high plateau pressures, similarly to a high PEEP and long inspiratory time strategy with conventional ventilation, which maintains recruitment with potentially less risk of VILI. The ELSO recommendations regarding PEEP offer a wide acceptable range \u2013 5\u201315 cmH2O [25]. The use of PEEP at the higher end of this range in neonates with respiratory failure has been shown to lead to shorter duration of ECMO [93, 94]. Similarly, in adults on V-V ECMO, higher PEEP during the first 3 days on ECMO has been associated with improved survival [95]. Conversely, higher PEEP over the whole ECMO course has been shown to be associated with increased mortality [96]. It is hard to reconcile these seemingly incongruous findings. However, one could hypothesize that PEEP later in the ECMO course is more related to patient factors than ventilator strategy. In other words, patients with improving lung disease will have PEEP decreased over the course on ECMO, while patients who do not improve and ultimately die will remain on higher PEEP throughout their course. Additionally, high PEEP in the first 3 days on ECMO is more likely to be a conscientious strategy of maintaining lung recruitment and less so reflective of the patient\u2019s severity of lung disease.",

            "text": "The risks of maintaining a higher MAwP must be weighed against the risks of allowing lung collapse. High MAwP will cause elevated intrathoracic pressure which may impair hemodynamics due to impaired venous return. Elevated static pressures, like those used in an open-lung ventilation strategy or in APRV, do not to contribute significantly to VILI [97]. There are also risks to a lung-rest approach resulting in complete lung collapse. Hemodynamically, lung collapse will lead to increased right ventricular afterload by way of increased pulmonary vascular resistance. On V-V ECMO, lung collapse will also lead to severe pulmonary venous desaturation, and systemic arterial saturations will suffer. Additionally, there is emerging evidence of the damaging effects of recurrent atelectasis, often called atelectrauma [8, 98, 99]. If there is complete lung collapse, the lungs will need to be re-recruited later in the ECMO course, which often can only be accomplished with high driving pressure, which is the biggest contributor to VILI [97]. Lastly, the time necessary to re-recruit the lungs may prolong the ECMO course. Neonatal data shows that higher PEEP (i.e.,12\u201314 cmH2O vs 4\u20136 cmH2O) leads to shorter ECMO runs and fewer complications [93, 94]. Identifying the ideal PEEP for a patient is a multifactorial decision that includes evaluation of lung expansion on chest x-ray, hemodynamics, oxygenation, lung compliance, and other factors. In a recent study, the use of electrical impedance tomography for adult patients with respiratory failure on ECMO showed that an optimal PEEP of 15 cmH2O best balanced overdistension and lung collapse [100].",

It has been suggested, therefore, that the best way to limit VILI would be to remove the \u201cV\u201d or ventilator. Extubating patients on V-V ECMO has been shown to be feasible and safe in selected patients [90, 109]. In one retrospective study, extubation on ECMO was associated with improved survival [109]. If extubation is feasible, there is the benefit of reducing sedation once the noxious stimulus that is the endotracheal tube is removed. Patients who are extubated and not sedated will also be able to participate in more aggressive rehabilitation while on ECMO. Not all patients will be candidates for extubation on ECMO. Younger patients, for instance, may require paralysis or heavy sedation to prevent mechanical complications, obviating any possibility of extubation.

ECMO requires a team approach between ECMO technicians, bedside nurses, respiratory therapists, surgeons, intensivists, and other medical personnel. All members of the team must have an understanding of the special needs of a patient on ECMO.

The single cut-point that produced the most significant difference in mortality was 22 cases per year [110]. In another study, there was a strong relationship between center volume and mortality for pediatric cardiac patients [111]. Lastly, when survival was assessed based on age-specific center ECMO volumes, neonatal and adult volumes were significantly associated with survival, and there was a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival in higher-volume centers for pediatric patients [112]. The effect of center volume is particularly difficult to answer concerning pediatric respiratory ECMO. A medium-to-large sized pediatric ECMO program may only have five respiratory cases per year, and few centers perform more than ten pediatric respiratory ECMO runs annually. A recent international position paper on ECMO for acute respiratory failure in adults argues for centralization of ECMO and a minimum of 20 ECMO cases per year, with 12 of them being for respiratory support [113]. This recommendation is based on the pediatric data discussed above and expert opinion.",

Patients who were transferred had improved survival (63% vs. 47%), even though only 75% of transferred patients were cannulated for ECMO [5]. Therefore, early transfer from centers that do not provide ECMO can be recommended for patients with severe ARDS with high OI. Volume alone however does not ensure quality care; education, training, and ongoing quality improvement must be combined with clinical expertise. It is recommended that all personnel caring for patients on ECMO are familiar with the circuit function and potential complications [26]. Given the relative rarity of ECMO, particularly pediatric respiratory ECMO, hands-on clinical experience can be limited. Simulation is a tool that can increase familiarity to ECMO and its complications. Simulation has been shown to be a beneficial educational tool in ECMO [114, 115]. A simulation program for all personnel caring for ECMO patients should be pursued, especially at low-volume centers, to augment orientation and ongoing learning.",

Survival in pediatric respiratory ECMO patients steadily decreases as length of ECMO increases from 5 days to 37 days, and there is a late steep drop in survival after approximately 48 days on ECMO [116]. From 1993 to 2007, there were no survivors of the nine patients supported on ECMO for 52 days or more in the ELSO database [116]. More recently, there have been many cases reported of long-term respiratory ECMO in both children and adults with good outcomes, including lung transplant or late lung recovery after up to 265 days of ECMO [116\u2013121]. These reports are remarkable as, historically, it has been thought that if native lung function was not improving or restored at 2\u20134 weeks of ECMO support, the chance of recovery was remote [119]. As evidenced by these case reports of successful prolonged ECMO, there may be previously underappreciated regenerative capacity of the lungs. The paradigm for lung recovery may be more similar to recovery of kidney function after acute kidney injury, where the chances of recovery of native function decrease over time, but there is still potential for return to normal function in some patients even weeks to months after injury.\n",

Tracheostomy on ECMO is not common practice in pediatrics, with only 13% of pediatric centers reporting performing tracheostomies in these patients [90]. The placement of tracheostomy while on ECMO is more frequently performed in adults [90]. To our knowledge, the largest report of tracheostomy on ECMO at a pediatric institution contains nine patients ages 7\u201325 years [125]. Two of nine survived without lung transplantation, and four survived with lung transplantation. All patients had decreased sedation needs within 72 h. The biggest concern with performing tracheostomy on ECMO is bleeding due to anticoagulation. Practices for anticoagulation vary from holding of anticoagulation around the time of procedure to varying reductions in heparin dosing [90, 125]. In two adult case series of 168 ECMO patients in total, minor bleeding after tracheostomy was common (approximately 30%), while major bleeding occurred in only 2% and 8% of cases. No deaths were attributed to complications of tracheostomy [126, 127]. If tracheostomy is to be considered, the timing of tracheostomy remains a difficult decision. The average time on ECMO to tracheostomy in the pediatric study of nine patients was 10 days [125]. Older pediatric patients with longer than average expected ECMO durations or those on ECMO as a bridge to lung transplant are most likely to benefit. These patients may be able to tolerate decreases in sedation and actively participate in rehabilitation due to developmental stage. These patients are also the same subset of children that may benefit from extubation on ECMO. Tracheostomy is a higher risk than extubation due to bleeding complications but would be preferred when the ECMO circuit cannot support oxygenation without positive-pressure ventilation.",

Additionally, patients ambulated on ECMO have lower hospital costs than those who do not ambulate [131]. In a survey of 208 adult ECMO centers, major barriers to ambulation identified included concerns about hemodynamic instability, hypoxemia, and femoral cannulation [132]. In pediatrics, these barriers are present, but there is additional concern for cannula movement. Pediatric patients have a smaller margin for error in the location of cannula, especially when a bicaval cannula is being used for V-V-ECMO.",

Within this framework, ECMO serves as a bridge to a destination for each child it supports. Potential pathways include bridge to a diagnosis, bridge to recovery, and bridge to lung transplantation. Making diagnostic determinations and outlining criteria for lung transplantation are typically concrete decisions within the medical team\u2019s grasp. Likewise, the development of a catastrophic complication (e.g., massive hemorrhagic stroke) on ECMO renders the decision to terminate ECMO support, in most instances, straightforward. But in the absence of such a complication, our ability to predict pulmonary recovery is fraught with difficulty and uncertainty. Much of this complexity is related to the tremendous amount of heterogeneity within our patient population in the pediatric ICU, including diagnosis, age, comorbidities, and many of the other factors discussed in the preceding sections. Decision-making around prolonged ECMO support is challenging due to these limitations, and the clinical team may find uncertainty as to whether pulmonary recovery is still possible or if continuing ECMO now reached the point of futility. A multidisciplinary discussion of prognosis and probability of lung recovery should be initiated by 3 weeks of support, when the chance of survival begins to decline [116]. Current recommendations in the ethics literature suggest a careful analysis for potentially inappropriate care ECMO when respiratory support reaches 2\u20133 months [133].",

However, several issues make true informed consent difficult, if not sometimes impossible, during these conversations such as complex and unfamiliar technology, uncertainty regarding diagnosis and prognosis, limited time for discussion due to acuity of the clinical situation, and a sense of urgency conveyed by the medical team [134]. The specific necessity of withdrawal of ECMO support in cases of futility is recommended as a standard component of the consent form for ECMO [133]. Second, P-PREP [135] and Ped-RESCUER [136] are recently validated prediction models that help pediatric intensivists estimate the mortality risk for children with respiratory failure at the time of initiation of ECMO (Table 2.2). Both models consider patient diagnosis, several pre-ECMO variables, and accompanying comorbidities. While not perfect tools, P-PREP and Ped-RESCUERS can provide the clinical team guidance when counseling families regarding their child\u2019s risk of dying on ECMO.\n",
