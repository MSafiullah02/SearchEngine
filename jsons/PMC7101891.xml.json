However, IL-1\u03b1 remains within the cytosol in almost all instances.[6] IL-1\u03b1 is active in both precursor and mature forms, but IL-1\u03b2 is only active upon cleavage by the cytosolic cysteine protease IL-1\u03b2 converting enzyme (ICE), found in monocytes.[7] IL-1\u03b2 remains cytosolic in nonphagocytic cells, but 40 to 60% of the IL-1\u03b2 that is produced by mononuclear phagocytes exits the cell via vesicle exocytosis, active transport, leakage or cell death.[6]",

Prostaglandin synthesis is induced indirectly, by up-regulation of gene expression of the inducible type 2 cyclo-oxygenase.[6] Cyclo-oxygenase products in turn induce corticotropin (ACTH) release via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; this possibly serves as a biological negative feedback, since corticosteroids inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, and adrenalectomised mice have an increased risk of IL-1-induced death.[9]",

IL-1 induces hypotension by acting on the vasculature, the myocardium, and sodium transport.[10] It inhibits vascular smooth muscle contraction independently of prostaglandin synthesis, facilitating L-arginine-dependent NO production; this leads to increased guanylate cyclase activity.[11] In the myocardium, IL-1 suppresses the rate of spontaneous contractions, and reduces the contractile response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation.[12] Systemic injection of IL-1 augments the renal excretion of sodium.[6] Within the central nervous system, IL-1 acts as a potent pyrogen, probably at the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis; IL-1 receptors are distributed throughout the hypothalamus and arachidonic acid metabolites are released from the periventricular organ endothelium in response to IL-1 injection.[13] Additionally, IL-1 mediates fever both by induction of IL-6 and also independently of the pyrogenic activity of IL-6.[6] IL-1 injection in mice induces disinterest in the environment, sleepiness and anorexia. Presumably, this reaction is analogous to the \u2018sickness\u2019 syndrome characteristic of human illness. It may be responsible for many of the symptoms associated with infection and overtraining.",

This cytokine also promotes catabolism of lean tissue in synergy with tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF\u03b1); muscle protein breakdown during endotoxaemia (which is a potent stimulator of circulatory IL-1 release) can be reduced by treatment with IL-1ra.[15]",

Acute phase proteins synthesised mainly by the liver include serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein.[25] IL-6 enhances ACTH production in the anterior pituitary gland, signalling the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids.[20] The glucocorticoids, in turn, potentiate the effects of IL-6 (and other cytokines) upon hepatocytes. Negative feedback is provided by the inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on macrophages. This further down-regulates the production of IL-6, thus limiting a potentially dangerous positive feedback loop.[24]",

The IL-2R\u03b1 chain has a low affinity for IL-2, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 10-8 mol/L, until it joins with the IL-2R\u03b2 chain to form an intermediate affinity complex (Kd 10-9 mol/L). Formation of the high affinity receptor requires complexing of the intermediate affinity receptor with the \u03b3 chain; the heterotrimer has a Kd of 10-11 mol/L.[5] Soluble IL-2R (sIL-2R; \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits) attenuate the signal provided by IL-2.[50,51]",

The cytokine acts on T cells in an autocrine or juxtacrine manner.[51,52] Small (naive) T cells strongly express the IL-2R\u03b1 chain, but coexpression of \u03b1 and \u03b2 receptor subunits occurs in only 1 to 6% of resting T cells.[53] Upon activation with mitogen or antigen, both IL-2R\u03b1 and IL-2R\u03b2 become strongly expressed on T lymphocytes. IL-2 induces NK cells to become lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells. NK cells are a distinct population of CD3e-16+/-56+ lymphocytes that do not rearrange or express the T cell receptor gene; they mediate major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted cytotoxicity against a variety of tumour and virus-infected cells.[54] Both CD3e-16-56+ and CD3e-16+56+ cells express IL-2R\u03b2 constitutively at low levels, but only the CD16- subset constitutively expresses the intermediate affinity heterodimeric receptor.[54,55] This subset responds preferentially to lower concentrations of IL-2 with increased cytolytic activity and proliferation. Monocytes and macrophages express IL-2R\u03b2 constitutively at low levels, and they can be induced to express the IL-2R\u03b1 receptor subunit upon mitogen stimulation.[56] IL-2 induces proliferation of receptive monocytes, and it also stimulates growth and differentiation of B cells.[57]",

This allows intrachain disulfide linkage, and contributes to bioactivity and receptor specificity.[60] Like cytokines, the chemokines display synergy, antagonism, redundancy and pleiotropy in chemotaxis.

Urine concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 increased about 1.8-fold relative to before exercise, and values remained high for at least 24 hours following exercise. Bury et al.[96] had 7 healthy males exercise for 4 hours at 45% V\u0307O2max, 3 hours at 60% V\u0307O2max, and 2 hours at 75% V\u0307O2max, each bout of exercise being separated by enough time to preclude a cumulative training effect. With each of these protocols, IL-1 levels were significantly elevated, both immediately following exercise and 60 minutes after its termination. The magnitude of the increase depended on the intensity rather than the duration of exercise. Many other observers have found that IL-1\u03b2 production is unaffected by exercise unless the blood is stimulated.[110,116,117] It appears that although exercise alone may induce a limited output of IL-1, subsequent mitogenic stimulation allows investigators to amplify the effects of exercise, with implications not only for detection of this cytokine, but also for immune activation by exercise. IL-1 release depends on the type of exercise performed, its intensity and, to a lesser degree, the duration of exercise. IL-1 is among the first cytokines to be released in response to exercise stress.",

The participants were a heterogeneous group of masters and younger athletes. Stimulated IL-6 release was moderately increased immediately after exercise, but had reverted to resting values after 20 minutes of recovery. Moldoveanu et al.[81] exercised young volunteers for 3 hours at 60 to 65% of V\u0307O2max; this induced an 18-fold increase of IL-6, and values remained above initial resting levels for at least 2 hours.

The urinary IL-6 response to a 60-minute triathlon was investigated by Northoff and Berg.[103] They found elevated levels of IL-6 immediately after the run, but did not examine IL-6 concentrations at subsequent time-points. Northoff and Berg[103] also quantified cytokine release in the plasma of marathon runners. In this population, they found a significant increase shortly after the run, but not 24 hours later. Ostrowski et al.[85] had 10 moderately fit individuals exercise on a treadmill for 2.5 hours at 75% of their individual V\u0307O2max, and they also analysed plasma from athletes competing in the Copenhagen marathon. In accordance with the other studies, plasma IL-6 peaked immediately after exercise in both cases. Suzuki et al.[93] also observed 100-fold increases in IL-6 immediately following a marathon race. Northoff et al.[119] used a bioassay to semi-quantify plasma IL-6 concentrations in long-distance runners. Compared with pre-run values (37.6 units/ml), circulating IL-6 levels were significantly higher immediately after a prolonged run (79.8 units/ml), but not 24 hours later (41.4 units/ml). Unfortunately, although the proliferative bioassay used in this early study was sensitive to IL-6, it was not proven to be insensitive to IL-7. Nehlsen-Cannarella et al.[98] showed that plasma IL-6 levels in 30 experienced marathon runners peaked immediately after a 2.5 hours run, whether individuals were carbohydrate-supplemented or not; values had returned close to baseline 1.5 to 3 hours after exercise.",

            "text": "Rivier et al.[100] investigated TNF\u03b1 production by blood monocytes in terms of translated and secreted protein. Combined data from masters athletes and younger individuals indicated a nonsignificant trend for monocyte TNF release to increase immediately after exercise, but in their participants there was a decrease below baseline during the post-exercise recovery period. Further evidence that exercise may attenuate monocyte TNF production comes from the work of Bagby et al.[109] They investigated the effect of exhaustive running-wheel exercise on the TNF response of rats to lipopolysaccharide (1 mg/kg body mass). Exercise severely depressed the circulatory TNF\u03b1 response for up to 3 hours after exercise. Moreover, heart rate and blood pressure nadirs correlated with TNF\u03b1 concentrations, recapitulating the effects of stress-activated TNF\u03b1 on the myocardium and vasculature.[122] Baum et al.[108] noted that 90 minutes of exhaustive exercise decreased the release of TNF\u03b1 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated whole blood. Exercise, therefore, appears to have different effects on the production of IL-1 and TNF by immune cells; it tends to magnify the IL-1 response to lipopolysaccharide, but it can reduce that to TNF. This is surprising, given the close association of these 2 cytokines in pathophysiological contexts such as general inflammation. Divergent results in studies focusing on TNF may be explicable by inconsistencies in experimental design. In vivo or in vitro administration of glucocorticoids suppresses the lipopolysaccharide-induced release of TNF\u03b1 by blood monocytes.[123] It is though that elevated glucocorticoid levels suppress the effect of exercise on circulatory TNF, and it may be instructive to test this hypothesis in adrenalectomised animals.[123] In humans, investigation of the dependency of TNF on cortisol levels may be enlightening, as would be protocols designed to account for or eliminate the glucocorticoid stress response.",

            "text": "Most studies show that exercise impairs the ability of mitogenically stimulated lymphocytes to produce IL-2. Data on unstimulated cells are more divergent (table II). Rhind et al.[124] reported that 60 minutes of exercise at 60% V\u0307O2max decreased culture supernatant IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated PBMC; no IL-2 production was detected in unstimulated cells. The [3H]thymidine incorporation of PHA-stimulated cells, indicative of DNA synthesis, was also reduced by exercise. Administration of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) enhanced PHA-stimulated cell growth, but did not reverse the exercise-induced suppression of mitogen responsiveness. However, exercise made the cells more responsive to rIL-2 administration, an observation explicable by changes in soluble and cell surface IL-2R. In agreement with these data, Lewicki et al.[92] showed that when 11 trained men were exercised incrementally to exhaustion (over a mean time of 20 minutes), the PHA-stimulated IL-2 release of PBMC was diminished by 27% immediately after exercise and suppression was even greater 2 hours after exercise. Espersen et al.[107] were able to measure plasma IL-2 levels. They found no change immediately after exercise, but plasma IL-2 levels had increased significantly over baseline 24 hours after exercise. Animal studies on splenocyte IL-2 production generally have used concanavalin-A (Con-A) stimulation, but results have failed to agree with each other.",

Rhind et al.[124] demonstrated that serum IL-2R levels were elevated significantly immediately after exercise, and peaked 60 minutes after cessation of physical activity. The IL-2R\u03b1 (CD25) and IL-2R\u03b2 (CD122) subunits of IL-2R were transiently up-regulated on the lymphocyte cell surface during exercise. Possibly, this could account for the increased proliferation in response to rIL-2 in lymphocytes taken from individuals who had exercised. The CD25+ (IL-2R\u03b1+) and CD122+ (IL-2R\u03b2+) phenotypes diminished to normal levels within 30 minutes of recovery.[124] Dufaux and Order[106] showed a more prolonged increase in sIL-2R levels in response to a 2.5-hour run. Levels rose during the first 24 hours of recovery, although increments only became statistically significant at 24 and 48 hours of sampling. Lewicki et al.[92] showed that after incremental exercise to exhaustion, PHA stimulation of PBMC resulted in a 23% decreased expression of CD25, whereas the CD25 expression of unstimulated cells increased 3-fold in response to exercise. Sprenger et al.[95] noted that under cold conditions, a 20km run lasting 95 to 120 minutes doubled urinary excretion of sIL-2R.",

Rall et al.[149] investigated the effects of 12 weeks of strength training on cytokine responses in the young, the elderly and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Twice weekly exercise bouts comprised 3 sets of 8 repetitions of 1 repetition maximum (RM) contractions. There were no changes in IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-2 or prostaglandin production. However, the duration of the stimulus for adaptation as well as the exercise modality employed may have been inappropriate to induce the desired changes. Several other studies have investigated the difference in T cell function between sedentary and aerobically conditioned elderly individuals.[140] Both NK cell activity (measured in lytic units) and lymphocyte proliferation in response to PHA have generally been higher among highly conditioned individuals. These studies have used aerobically trained rather than strength-trained athletes. Shinkai et al.[143] compared the resting immune function of 17 elderly male runners (mean age 63.8 years) with 16 young (mean age 23.6 years) and 19 sedentary elderly (mean age 65.8 years) individuals. The active elderly individuals had an average aerobic power that was 33% greater than that of sedentary controls. They retained superior T cell proliferative responses to pokeweed mitogen and PHA, as well as a stronger production of IL-2, IFN\u03b3 and IL-4. Animal studies generally support these observations. Hoffman-Goetz and Sweeny[151] determined the effects of 8 weeks of voluntary wheel running in female, outbred Swiss Webster mice. NK/LAK activity against YAC-1 tumour cell targets was significantly higher in physically active animals compared with those not given access to a running wheel. However, it remained unclear whether the increased cytolytic activity was attributable to increased IL-1 or IL-2 production by the active animals. Nasrullah and Mazzeo[125] demonstrated that 15 weeks of aerobic training improved the T cell proliferative response of elderly rats, and augmented their ability to produce IL-2.",

Hesselink et al.[172] found that when isolated muscle was subjected to 120 or more eccentric contractions, muscle damage could be observed relative to isometrically contracted or control muscle tissue. In this study,[172] muscle damage was defined as an infiltration of fibres with mononuclear cells, the formation of multiple nuclei, or obvious swelling on histological examination. Clarkson et al.[160] proposed that the immediate loss of strength associated with eccentric exercise may be caused by the overstretching of sarcomeres. A decrease in overlap between actin and myosin filaments reduces sustainable contractile force and predisposes to damage. In support of this hypothesis, Newham and Ghosh[173] found that strength losses were greater if eccentric exercise was performed close to the extended extremity of the range of a muscle than if it was performed near to its contracted extremity. Armstrong et al.[158] reported that disruptions in the striation patterns of slow twitch rat extensor muscles were seen immediately following eccentric running.",

However, Cetinkale et al.[167] found increased malondialdehyde levels in blood taken 24 hours after severe thermal injury, indicating increased oxidative stress. The authors concluded that both direct thermal injury and immune cell oxidative processes contributed to increased lipid peroxidation. Battal et al.[169] studied the blocking of endothelin-A and -B activity during thermal injury. Endothelins potentiate the effect of local thrombosis to the point of occluding the microcirculation adjacent to a burn, causing necrotic damage of otherwise unaffected tissue.

Infection often exacerbates tissue damage following thermal injury or surgery, triggering the action of innate and adaptive immune cells.[176] In the absence of infection, innate immune cell function is directed toward restoration of normal function in the vicinity of injury. Phagocytosis and coagulatory mechanisms clean up detritus and sterilise the area, this stage being followed by angiogenesis and functional restoration of native tissue.[138] Neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages play an important role. Neutrophils normally have a circulatory life span of approximately 6 days, but during sepsis they are rescued from apoptosis by cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, as well as by circulatory indicators of sepsis such as lipopolysaccharide.[164] The survival of monocytes in human blood is also increased by lipopolysaccharide, but the more differentiated macrophages show a fragmentation of genomic DNA. This indicates apoptosis, and it makes data on these cell populations difficult to interpret in relation to the tissue damage induced by sepsis.[164] Bliff et al.[165] speculated that the increased lifespan of monocytes, coupled with a greater chemokine stimulus for extravasation, could cause greater exposure to activated immune cells and potentially more oxidative damage of otherwise healthy tissue.",

In some models such as ischaemia/reperfusion, neutrophils can damage muscle tissue directly, but evidence of such damage in muscle tissue after physical activity is still inconclusive.[174] Although macrophages are present in human skeletal muscle both at rest and during exercise, their function is as yet unknown. To establish conclusively whether local phagocytic cells are responsible for the latent tissue damage observed after exercise, it will be necessary to compare intramuscular phagocyte function before and after exercise. It is possible that macrophages mainly mediate muscle rebuilding and hypertrophy.[174] Their presence seems a requirement for regeneration of skeletal muscle tissue; specialised macrophage subpopulations infiltrate muscle tissue during different stages of the recovery process.[161]",

However, creatine kinase levels did not peak until well after the appearance of IL-6, indicating that IL-6 is more rapidly induced than the usually accepted indicator of muscle damage, creatine kinase. Cannon and colleagues[86] found that IL-1\u03b2 protein was elevated in the muscle tissue of individuals who performed 45 minutes of downhill running, although samples were evaluated for relative IL-1\u03b2 staining intensity only 45 minutes and 5 days after exercise, and no data were obtained on the kinetics of IL-1\u03b2 production in between these time points. Fielding et al.[84] used a comparable protocol to evaluate the immunohistochemical staining of intramuscular IL-1\u03b2. They found a 135% increase immediately after exercise and a 250% increase 5 days after exercise. The handful of experiments investigating the cytokine response to eccentric exercise point to a promising model of tissue damage and inflammation, but more work is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this mode of exercise in mimicking the responses observed in subclinical inflammation.",

Ostrowski et al.[85] demonstrated that the strenuous exercise-induced circulatory release of cytokines is sequentially similar to that induced during subclinical inflammation and sepsis. In marked similarity to both lethal and sublethal models of sepsis, TNF\u03b1 was the first cytokine to be released, followed in sequence by IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1ra. Importantly, the 100-fold elevation of IL-6 with exercise was quantitatively similar to the circulatory increases observed during sepsis. However, the modest (2.5-fold) increases in IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1, and difficulties in reproducing competitive stress levels in the laboratory, limit the applicability of this protocol as a model for inflammation.

Although creatine kinase was significantly elevated only after resistance exercise, the cytokine release profile indicated that prolonged endurance activity (in this case 2 hours of cycle ergometry at 60 to 65% V\u0307O2max) was most closely representative of the subclinical inflammatory response. In this study, prolonged exercise induced a transient rise in IL-6 that peaked 3 hours after exercise, but circulating TNF\u03b1 levels increased slowly for 72 hours and may still have been climbing at the last sampling point. The modest extent of the exercise-induced increase in cytokine concentration brings into question the physiological significance of such slight responses. In this study, modulation of IL-10 was observed only after brief, intense exercise, in response to which circulatory IL-10 was reduced slightly but significantly. Therefore, the induction of tissue damage may not be of primary importance in using exercise as a model of the inflammatory response.",

It may be up-regulated by TNF\u03b1, whereas the chemokine IL-8 seems to follow the kinetics of IL-6.[152,189] In severe cases, the anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1ra and IL-10 have negligible physiological significance compared with the onslaught of the pro-inflammatory mediators.[152] For example, in a murine lethal endotoxin challenge model, Napolitano et al.[199] demonstrated that circulatory IL-4 was only up-regulated if exogenous anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibodies were also administered; this indicates a possible interdependency of these cytokines.",

Depending on the magnitude of response, the inflammatory state is either resolved or ends terminally. Thermal injury and physical trauma are more difficult to characterise because of the incomparability of implemented experimental designs. The pro-inflammatory cytokines seem to be up-regulated by trauma, but significant immunosuppression is also induced by other soluble mediators such as IL-4 and IL-10.[177] Although the cytokine response to heavy physical activity superficially resembles that accompanying trauma and infection, mechanisms may be very different, and typically there are marked differences in symptomatology. In most cases the cytokine response even to sublethal sepsis differs by several orders of magnitude, making it difficult to use one condition as a model of the other. Even the heaviest forms of physical activity induce only mild cytokine alterations when compared with sepsis. Moreover, ethical considerations preclude the implementation (in humans) of protocols that are punishing enough to elicit significant tissue damage. Distinctions abound: for example, sepsis depresses myocardial function, whereas physical activity usually does not.[122,201] However, physical activity induces endogenous pyrogenic activity in human blood, implying that changes in cytokine levels or their reception mimic, to some degree, the changes observed in inflammation.[202]",

Provocative results on exercise modulation of IL-2 and its receptor dictate the need for further study of its close functional relative, IL-15, considering both the overlap of properties with IL-2, and its resistance to down-regulation by IL-4, IL-13, transforming growth factor \u03b2 and IL-10.[58] Regulation of the newly characterised chemokine IL-16 and other well known chemokines such as RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) need investigation in the context of physical activity and the general inflammatory response.[48,60,207] The responses to exercise, trauma and infection of the T cell-derived IL-17, which induces the production of pro-inflammatory and haemopoietic cytokines, as well as the IFN\u03b3-inducing factor, IL-18, may also be revealing.[208\u2013210] LIF, a pleiotropic cytokine with seemingly unrelated effects on several cell types such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, and neural cells, should also be investigated in the context of inflammation.[211] Unfortunately, efforts to quantify the response of some of the \u2018newer\u2019 cytokines will be limited to laboratories capable of designing quantification protocols de novo, as, to date, there are no commercially available reagents with which to pursue this endeavour.",

For example, keratinocytes stimulated topically with a derivative of the immune modulator imiquimod, a possible antitumor and antiviral agent, up-regulate gene expression of IL-1\u03b1, IL-8, TNF and IFN\u03b3.[213] Cytokine protein production by these cells increases predictably for all but IFN\u03b3, the synthesis of which actually decreases.",

In quantifying gene expression, it is necessary to establish not only the change in transcript level, but also the level of transcript stability. The latter depends on post-transcriptional modification of the nascent RNA by processes such as capping, methylation and polyadenylation, as well as levels and reactivities of endogenous ribonucleases.[5] Kinetic studies exploring the relationship of cytokine gene expression to circulatory protein levels have to be established for a variety of inflammatory stimuli, including physical activity, trauma and infection.",

Similarities in cytokine response to infection and exercise have focused on the appropriateness of physical activity as a model for various forms of injury and inducers of inflammation. Future research should determine how far these striking similarities hold under close scrutiny. Resemblances may turn out to be superficial and limited to the cytokines studied thus far. Considering the uniqueness of most biological response equilibria, and the differences in pathophysiology and outcome between exercise-induced and other forms of inflammation, it seems likely that future studies will emphasise the distinctiveness of the cytokine response to physical activity. There are clearly qualitative differences in the way the body responds to exercise and the way it reacts to trauma and infection. However, this is not surprising, considering the difference in type and magnitude of the respective stimuli.",
