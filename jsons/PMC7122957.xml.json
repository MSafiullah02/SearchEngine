However, the number of genes revealed by whole genome sequencing does not set the upper limit of the repertoire of proteins. Protein posttranslational modifications, especially glycsylation, further diversify the available repertoire of functional proteins in a living organism. Protein glycosylation results in attachment of carbohydrate moieties at certain sites of a newly synthesized protein by either N-glycosylation or O-glycosylation. About 50% of the proteins in eukaryotes are found to be glycosylated [1]. Virtually all mammalian cells and micro-organisms are decorated with characteristic carbohydrate moieties. Exploring the biological information content in carbohydrates represents one of the current focuses of postge-nomic research and technology development.",

As in DNA and proteins, a carbohydrate' s structural diversity comes from the composition of its repeat units and the sequence of these units. In mammals, there are nine common monosaccharide repeat units. A unique source of diversity to carbohydrates is the possibility to form branched structures because linkages can occur at multiple locations on a monosaccharide. As discussed below, the location of the linkage can be an important parameter in molecular recognition. For example, the flu virus recognizes the same monosaccharide units in both humans and birds; however, strains specific for birds recognize a linkage at a different location than those specific for humans (see below). In addition, the configuration at the anomeric position is another source of diversity.",

A pyranoside (six-membered ring monosaccharide) can bond to another pyranoside at five different positions with each linkage being in an \u03b1 or \u03b2 orientation. The potential to create differential linkages allows monosaccharides to form a more diverse array of oligomers in comparison to oligonucleotides and amino acids. For example, any fully hydroxylated pyranoside can form 11 possible disaccharides. A given amino acid can form only one dipeptide. A trimer of the nine common sugar residues found in mammals could potentially give rise to 119,736 different biological \u201c expressions. \u201d A trimer of the 20 amino acids or four oligonu-cleotides can form only 8000 and 64 \u201cexpressions \u201d in comparison. It should be noted that bacteria contain over 100 types of monosaccharides, often containing functional groups not found in mammalian monosaccharides, making the potential number of sugar structures found in nature well beyond the number found in mammals.",

The two major classes of glycoconjugates, glycolipids and glycoproteins, are present in many living organisms. Each of these can be further subdivided. Glycoproteins bearing amino sugars, called glycosaminoglycans, are categorized as proteoglycans. Peptidoglycans are glycosaminoglycans cross-linked by peptides. Glycopeptides are oligosaccharides bound to oligopeptides and are either degradation products or are chemically synthesized. Glycosphingolipids are gly-colipids in which an oligosaccharide is covalently attached to the lipid sphinganine.

If the glycoprotein loses its sialic acid residue, a galactose residue is exposed and recognized by a liver surface protein called the asialoglycoprotein receptor (asialo meaning \u201cwithout sialic acid \u201d). When enough galactose residues are exposed, multiple interactions bind the \u201cold \u201d erythrocyte to the liver. The \u201cold \u201d erythrocyte is then absorbed into the liver for degradation. However, the native structures of cellular N-glycans are much more complex than the schematics in Fig. 9.1a. The sugar moieties recognized by the liver asialoglycoprotein receptor are in triantennary and multiantennary configurations without sialic acid caps [4]; Fig. 9.1b).\n\n",

In the first step, a carbohydrate microarray is used to characterize antibody responses to an infectious agent or antigen preparation in order to recognize the disease- or pathogen- associated anticarbohydrate antibody specificities. The second step focuses on identifying lectins and/or antibodies that are specific for the gly-coepitopes that are recognized by the pathogen-elicited antibodies. This provides specific structural probes to enable the third step of investigation, that is, to identify the glycoepitopes in the candidate pathogens using specific lectins or antibodies identified in steps 1 and 2.",

In addition, if SARS-CoV displayed a carbohydrate structure that mimicked host cellular gly-cans, then vaccinated animals may develop antibodies with autoimmune reactivity to their corresponding cellular glycans. By characterizing the SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies elicited by an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine, autoan-tibody reactivity specific for the carbohydrate moieties of an abundant human serum glycoprotein, asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR), was detected [5]. This \u201cchip hit\u201d provides important clues for the selection of specific immunologic probes to further examine whether SARS-CoV expresses antigenic structures that imitate the host glycan. Given that lectin PHA-L is specific for glycoepitopes Tri-II or mII of ASOR (See Fig. 9.1b for an asialo-Tri-II structure of N-glycans), this lec-tin was applied as a structural probe to examine whether SARS-CoV expresses the PHA-L reactive antigenic structure. The results demonstrated that glyco-epitopes Tri-II or mII of ASOR are highly expressed by SARS-CoV-infected cells and by the viral particles.",

Aside from foreboding commentary of the emergence of a pandemic strain in the near future, virulent episodes from 1918 that claimed more than 50 million lives has left a lasting interest in understanding the immunogenic details of this virus. Influenza A infection is initiated by binding of hemagglutinin (HA), an antigenic protein found on the virus' coat, to carbohydrates on the surface of the host's epithelial cells. HA recognizes sialic acid terminated glycans and its linkage to galactose residues (see Fig. 9.1 for sialic acid terminated glycans in the Tri-II sugar chain configuration). The receptor specificity of various serotypes has been studied using cell-based assays. HA variants adapted to humans recognize an \u03b12\u20136 linkage whereas strains specific for birds recognize an \u03b12\u20133 linkage.

For example, NB-DNJ is an inhibitor that prevents a glucosidase enzyme from constructing appropriate carbohydrates on gp120, a glycoprotein of HIV mentioned above, reducing the virus' ability to bind to leucocytes. The specificity of enzymes that modify carbohydrates can be probed by treating a carbohydrate array with a given enzyme. Modified carbohydrates can then be revealed by lectin interactions. In addition, potential inhibitors of the enzyme activity can be screened by mixing selected candidates with the enzyme prior to treating the array. Carbohydrates stabilized on a microtiter plate through hydrophobic interactions have been used to reveal inhibitors of fucosyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for transferring a fucose residue from GDP-fucose to a sialyl-lactosamine to form sialyl-Lewisx, a tetrasaccharide involved in the inflammatory response in mammalian tissue [34]. By incubating various candidate inhibitors with the enzyme prior to immersing the microarray, four inhibitors with nanomolar Ki values were discovered.

However, the efficacy of saccharide immobilization by noncovalent bonding is under the influence of the physicochem-ical properties of the given molecules. The stability of immobilization and exposure of the desired glycoepitopes or antigenic determinants must be examined for each saccharide on the substrate [5, 28, 31, 37, 38].",

Tethering a monolayer of phthalimide-derivatized silanes to a glass surface, SAM 1 (Fig. 9.4), provides a platform for covalently immobilizing sugars on chips. The phthalimide molecule is covalently bound to the glass through a condensation reaction between a trimethoxy silane and Si\u2013OH groups at the glass surface.

This is in contrast to the film studies in which a pure monolayer was sufficient to immobilize sugars. The discrepancy is probably a result of the film's sampling a much larger area of the surface in comparison to a spot of approximately 200 \u03bcm, making immobilized sugars easier to detect.

The amine acts as bait to pull the sugars onto the surface through a favorable hydrophilic interaction. The hydrophilic gaps are also expected to put the carbohydrate in a more favorable location for the phthalimide to abstract a hydrogen atom from the sugar. The structure of the surface is probably more complicated than the simple picture shown in Fig. 9.6. If a monolayer is formed, the phthalimide most likely will try to tilt over the amines to reduce the interfacial tension. In addition, it is possible that like molecules cluster or even phase-separate within the mixed monolayer, or those multilayers, oligomers, or polymers form, but these phenomena have not yet been investigated in this system.
