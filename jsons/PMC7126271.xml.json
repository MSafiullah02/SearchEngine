            "text": "An alternative method of virus purification/removal is virus adsorption which takes advantage of the attractive interaction between a virion and an adsorbent. Such interaction may be of various nature. Since the surface of viruses may become charged depending on their isoelectric point (IEP) and pH of the environment, their interactions with the adsorbents may be primarily electrostatic (at pH values sufficiently different from IEP) or mostly hydrophobic (at pH \u2248 IEP) [15]. The surface of virions may be both positively (at pH < IEP) and negatively (at pH > IEP) charged so they may be adsorbed by sorbents with both negatively and positively charged surface, respectively. Consequently, materials previously reported as virus adsorbents are of different nature. The examples of inorganic adsorbents are clays such as kaolinite, montmorillonite, and bentonite [16]. Their adsorption efficiency for viruses is very different but generally low. For kaolinite at the concentration of 50 g/l the log removal value (LRV) was 2.18, while montmorillonite and bentonite were much less efficient. Thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption of some bacteriophages to clays depended on the hydrophobicity of the surface of both clays and viruses [17]. The ability to adsorb viruses was shown for hybrid organic-inorganic materials, e.g., cellulose nanofibers enriched with \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanoparticles [18]. The hybrid inorganic nanoparticles with virus particles covalently bound to their surface have been also reported and used as virus delivery systems [19].",

For this purpose chitosan nano/microspheres (CHIT-NS/MS) crosslinked with genipin, a natural compound obtained from the fruit of Gardenia jasminoides, were prepared and then cationized with GTMAC to obtain nano/microspheres of HTCC (HTCC-NS/MS). Chemical composition of obtained biomaterials was investigated using elemental analysis (EA) and spectroscopic methods. The morphology and size of the polymeric objects obtained was visualized using microscopic techniques, i.e., confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The hydrodynamic radius of the nanospheres was determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. Surface charge in different media was assessed using zeta potential measurements. The ability of the biomaterial to adsorb selected coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, MHV and HCoV-OC43) was assessed. Changes in the infectivity of viral samples, due to interaction with adsorbent, were evaluated by virus titration according to Reed and Muench method and compared with total amount of viral RNA copies using real time PCR analysis. Adsorption and desorption of coronaviral particles on/from the surface of HTCC-NS/MS was directly visualized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique. Careful optimization of the material allowed for recovery (desorption) of infective coronaviral particles, which further broadens its possible applications. An advantage of the studied material is that chitosan (used in many other virus-related applications involving antiviral materials [34] and antiviral drugs [35], [36]) and genipin, are both non-toxic substances.",

To obtain a nanometer-sized fraction the synthesized particles were filtered using a syringe filter with a pore diameter of 0.22 \u03bcm. This allowed isolation of a particle fraction with an average diameter of 60 nm, as found from the DLS measurements. The respective nanoparticles were marked as CHIT-NS, L-HTCC-NS, M-HTCC-NS, and H-HTCC-NS. The measurements of the zeta potential of the nanospheric fraction of the particles were performed in water and in 3% H&E (Table 1\n).",

To find out if the virus inhibitory activity of HTCC is correlated with its adsorptive properties, we studied the specificity of the adsorption of these coronavirus strains by H-HTCC-NS/MS. For this purpose, monolayers of LR7 and HCT-8 cells were infected with MHV and HCoV-OC43, respectively. The infections were carried out for 2 (MHV) and 6 (HCoV-OC43) days at 37 \u00b0C and 32 \u00b0C, respectively. The virus titrations have shown that MHV titer decreases from TCID50 of ~ 6,285,500 to ~ 250,200 (about 25 times) due to adsorption on 5 mg/500 \u03bcl H-HTCC-NS/MS while it did not significantly change for HCoV-OC43 (Fig. 7\n). Therefore, this polymeric material can be used also for the effective adsorption of MHV, another coronavirus inhibited by water soluble HTCC. It was thus found that the coronaviral strains inhibited by water-soluble HTCC are also adsorbed by the particles made of this polymer which confirms that the anticoronaviral activity of HTCC is due to its direct attractive interaction with the respective viruses.",

It was found that HCoV-NL63 and MHV can be adsorbed on the surface of HTCC-NS/MS, while no significant adsorption was observed in the case of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Importantly, HCoV-NL63 is selectively adsorbed in the presence of lysed cell components which indicates that HTCC-NS/MS may be used for virus purification. The correlation of the adsorptive properties of HTCC particles with the virus inhibitory activity of its water-soluble form suggests that the nature of the inhibition is similar to that observed for neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, desorption of the HCoV-NL63 virions adsorbed on the HTCC-NS/MS surface is also possible by applying medium with high ionic strength. Noteworthy, desorbed HCoV-NL63 retained infectiousness. The increased degree of cationization of the polymeric particles enhanced adsorption of HCoV-NL63. This fact together with ionic strength-induced virus desorption indicate that the virus-polymer interaction is due to the electrostatic Coulomb attraction. Strong and selective adsorption of HCoV-NL63 combined with the possibility of the virus desorption with retained virulence indicate that HTCC-NS/MS is a material with a great potential in the detection, removal, separation, concentration and/or purification of HCoV-NL63 coronavirus.",
