Antimicrobial resistance rate is fostering the need to develop new strategies against drug-resistant superbugs. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small peptide-based molecules of 5-100 amino acids in length, with potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. They are part of the innate immune system, which can represent a minimal risk of resistance development. These characteristics contribute to the description of these molecules as promising new molecules in the development of new antimicrobial drugs. However, efforts in developing new medicines have not resulted in any decrease of drug resistance yet. Thus, a technological approach on improving existing drugs is gaining special interest. Nanomedicine provides easy access to innovative carriers, which ultimately enable the design and development of targeted delivery systems of the most efficient drugs with increased efficacy and reduced toxicity. Based on performance, successful experiments, and considerable market prospects, nanotechnology will undoubtedly lead a breakthrough in biomedical field also for infectious diseases, as there are several nanotechnological approaches that exhibit important roles in restoring antibiotic activity against resistant bacteria.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The discovery of new antimicrobial molecules in the early 1920s was a landmark in the field of pharmacology allowing the reduction of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, which were among the main causes of death worldwide [1] .

Both the peptides Pxt-5, having hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces, behaved like general surfactants and can be used as carriers. Bacteriocins, while very active at low concentrations, usually have low in vivo stability, being susceptible to degradation by proteolytic enzymes [4] .

With unique physicochemical characteristics, nanomaterials are sensitive and selective in the detection of bacterial signalling and may also exbibit intrinsic antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, nanomaterials can be used for antimicrobial drug delivery, and the incorporation of antimicrobial nanomaterials in medical devices and implants can prevent microbial adhesion and infection [11, 12] . All these facts are instrumental against antimicrobial resistance by compromising bacterial mechanisms of resistance [13] . Focusing on nanomaterials-based drug delivery systems, these offer an improved strategy to increase the therapeutic index, by decreasing the dosage and frequency of administration. Besides, nanomaterials promote intracellular drug delivery, mitigating the development of drug-resistant bacteria and also allowing targeted organ accumulation by functionalized surface modifications, thus limiting systemic side effects and immunosuppression [2] . Despite these promising outcomes, the main challenge of establishing clinical use is related to the evaluation of interactions of nano-antibiotics with cells, tissues and organs achieving information about their possible toxic effects, together with the production on a large scale [1, 14, 15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 174, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 814, "end": 818, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 819, "end": 822, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 942, "end": 946, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1392, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1680, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1684, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1688, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Several types of nanomaterials have shown potential in the pharmaceutical field.

The main interesting property of AMPs is their ability to selectively disrupt bacterial membranes without affecting mammalian cells, thus being safe. In addition, AMPs are referred to in the literature as host-defence peptides with anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, because they are synthesized molecules that take action on the defence mechanisms against biological threats of the living organism of origin [16] . The discovery of AMPs dates back to the first half of the 20th century when in 1939, Dubos extracted an antimicrobial agent from a soil Bacillus strain, proven to be effective in mice pneumococci infection. This extract was then fractioned allowing the identification of gramicidin. Despite some systemic toxicity, gramicidin has shown to be effective in the topical treatment of wounds and ulcers. The first animal-originated AMP to be reported is defensin, isolated from rabbit leukocytes in 1956 [17] . Nowadays, more than 2000 AMPs have been described and current molecular developments can be consulted in a series of databases available on the web (Table 2) , including natural identified molecules, as well as peptidomimetic molecules and analogues that are pharmacologically designed thanks to the use of bioinformatics [18] . Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved AMPs with well-established use include bacitracin, colistin and polymyxin B (although only for topical administration) [2] . Despite the lack of consensus on the influence of peptide sequence in biologic activity of AMPs, some common characteristics seem to be important and fairly related to their antimicrobial property. The main one is primarily charge, with 90% of AMPs being cationic, and secondly, hydrophobicity or amphipathicity, influencing solubility profiles and consequently bioavailability [19] . Associated with structural characteristics, these are also the main physicochemical properties that should also be taken into account in the design of new synthetic AMPs [17] . Compared to conventional antibiotics, AMPs demonstrate significant advantages such as potency and board spectrum of activity, as well as an additional activity to modulate the immune system responses and low resistance rates. They also show some limitations that impair their safe therapeutic use, such as sensitivity to proteolysis, influencing stability and undefined toxicological data for systemic use [20] . In addition, their cationic and amphiphilic nature lead to high binding to serum proteins after parenteral administration, with consequent rapid elimination from bloodstream circulation and accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system, thus resulting in toxic effects and reduced activity [21] . To overcome these limitations, some strategies have been developed, maximizing the proven therapeutic potential of AMPs. There are numerous methods for obtaining AMP delivery systems. AMPs could be immobilized onto a variety of materials or onto a variety of surfaces and still retain their antibacterial activity. Also, AMPs can be targeted through loading them in nanoparticulate systems with selective delivery capacities, including polymers, liposomes, hydrogels, nanospheres, nano-capsules and carbon nanotubes [19] . As practical examples on of these of strategies, the studies of Mishra et al. were focused on the development of an AMP-coated surface, specifically immobilizing Lassioglossin-III onto silicone-based catheters and its activity against urinary tract infections [22] . At the same time, Water et al. developed the possibility of encapsulating plectasin, a cationic AMP, into polymeric NPs and evaluated their efficacy on S. aureus strains [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 689, "end": 693, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1199, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1528, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1705, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2086, "end": 2090, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2263, "end": 2267, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2676, "end": 2680, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2974, "end": 2978, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3497, "end": 3501, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3764, "end": 3768, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3941, "end": 3945, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1350, "end": 1359, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs): New Additions to the Therapeutic Arsenal"}, {"text": "Bacteria show resistance to antibiotics drugs through a variety of mechanisms.

Consequently, many of the information on the application of nanotechnology in the infectious disease field regards the use of silver (Ag) and gold (Au) NPs [11, 12, 49] . Recently, derivatives of other metals have been studied for antimicrobial applications, and the antibacterial effects of zero-valent bismuth NPs and uncoated Au, nickel (Ni) and silicon (Si) NPs were reported [50, 51] . Despite the demonstrated intrinsic antimicrobial properties, dispersed metallic NPs tend to aggregate and separate in solution, resulting in a decrease in their antimicrobial efficiency. With the aim of improving antibacterial properties, functionalization of NPs has been attempted with surfactants, polymers or antibiotics resulting in more stable, less aggregated NPs suspension and innovative, synergistic antibacterial agents. For instance, silver NPs stabilized by polymers(polyvinylpyrrolidone) and surfactants (SDS and Tween 80) exhibit enhanced antibacterial activities [52] . NPs can also act as drug-carriers able to pass through cell membranes [53, 54] . Widely used antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin may benefit from the association with NPs, and conjugation may result in an antibacterial effect also against micro-organisms resistant to the same molecule in the naturally occurring form [55] . When the antimicrobial agents are covalently linked to or contained within, NPs, a higher drug concentration is attained in the area of interest, resulting in better efficacy at comparable doses and in slower release over time that may be exploited for preventing bacterial colonization [56, 57] . Moreover, specific biological sites can be attacked after modification of NPs with target molecules [58, 59] .

Even if at the beginning, the research in this field was focused on the possibility to exploit gold NPs in combination to laser radiation, thus significantly reducing bacteria viability due to cell lysis and mechanical disruption [61] . Currently, two recent studies have been reported exploring the use of Au nanostructures for AMP delivery. Photoluminescent Au nanodots (AuNDs) were prepared by Chen et al. [39] . These AuNDs were functionalized with hybridized ligands, an antimicrobial peptide (surfactin; SFT), and 1-dodecanethiol (DT), on AuNPs. Ultrasmall SFT/DT-Au NDs (size \u2248 2.5 nm) were achieved and exhibited highly efficient antimicrobial activity. The photoluminescence properties and stability as well as the antimicrobial activity of SFT/DT-Au NDs were also studied, and it was shown that these characteristics are highly dependent on the density of SFT on Au NDs. Relative to SFT, SFT/DT-AuNDs exhibited greater antimicrobial activity, not only to non-multidrug-resistant bacteria but also to the multidrug-resistant bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration values of SFT/DT-AuNDs were much lower (>80-fold) than that of SFT. The authors considered that the antimicrobial activity of SFT/DT-AuNDs was mainly achieved by the synergistic effect of SFT and DT-AuNDs on the disruption of the bacterial membrane. In vitro cytotoxicity and hemolysis, analyses were also performed and had revealed superior biocompatibility of SFT/DT-AuNDs than that of SFT. Moreover, in vivo methicillin-resistant S. aureus infected wound healing studies in rats showed faster healing, better epithelialization. This study suggested that the SFT/DT-AuNDs system may be a promising antimicrobial candidate for preclinical applications in treating wounds and skin infections [39] . Rai et al. also reported a one-step methodology to generate AMP-conjugated (AuNPs) [40] . The AMP-conjugated AuNPs prepared showed controlled size (14 nm) and low polydispersity and allowed the inclusion of high concentration of AMPs. Further, these systems demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and stability in serum and in the presence of non-physiological concentrations of proteolytic enzymes than soluble AMP, as well as low cytotoxicity against human cells [40] . Interestingly, Akrami et al. showed the possibility to exploit gold NPs as a novel anticancer platform [41] . Results of this research confirm the improvement of cell internalization of gold NPs, with higher cytotoxicity and cellular uptake for smaller NPs compared to larger nanospheres and nanorods, suggesting that anticancer effects of the selected peptides were modulated by the size and shape of the gold nanoparticles [41] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 553, "end": 557, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 732, "end": 736, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2096, "end": 2100, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2190, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2572, "end": 2576, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2682, "end": 2686, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3004, "end": 3008, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gold Nanoparticles"}, {"text": "Geilich et al. developed novel delivery systems by combining silver NPs and ampicillin so to achieve a synergistic dose-dependent effect on bacterial cells [42] . The obtained polymersomes were safe on human fibroblasts and more effective in inhibiting bacterial cells with a silver-to-ampicillin ratio of one to 0.64, respectively. Recent advances in AMP delivery by Ag nanostructures, Pazos et al. [43] reported on supramolecular assemblies of novel peptide amphiphiles (PAs) containing aldehyde functionality in order to reduce Ag ions and subsequently nucleate Ag metal NPs in water. This proposed system spontaneously generates monodisperse Ag particles at regular distances along the length of the filamentous organic assemblies. The metal\u2212organic hybrid structures exhibited antimicrobial activity and significantly less toxicity toward eukaryotic cells. Metallized organic nanofibers of the type described offer the possibility to create other structures. For instance, hydrogels, that can be potentially applied in wound dressing development [43] . Also addressing the wound infection problem, Salouti et al. investigated the synergistic antibacterial effect of plant peptide MBP-1 and AgNPs on infected wounds caused by S. aureus [44] . The MIC and MBC of MBP-1 and AgNPs both on their own and in combination form were determined against S. aureus via macrodilution and microdilution methods. The MIC and MBC of MBP-1 were found to be 0.6 and 0.7 mg/mL, respectively. MIC and MBC of AgNPs were determined to be 6.25 and 12.5 mg/L, respectively. MIC and MBC of the AgNPs and MBP-1 combination were found to be 3.125 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/L; and 6.25 mg/mL, 0.6 mg/L, respectively. The synergistic antibacterial effect of Ag NPs and MBP-1 was investigated on infected wounds caused by S. aureus in a mouse model, and the infected wound healed properly after the combined use of MBP-1 and AgNPs [44] . It is worth to note recent findings by Chaudhari et al. concerning the conjugation of silver-coated carbon nanotubes with the antimicrobial peptide TP359. Herein, authors underline the occurrence of an additive effect of silver-coated nanotubes and TP359 regarding antibacterial activity.

Membrane interactions are critical for the successful use of mesoporous SiNPs. In order to elucidate these, Braun et al. have studied the effects of NP charge and porosity on AMP loading and release, as well as consequences of this for membrane interactions and antimicrobial effects [46] . Anionic mesoporous SiNPs were found to incorporate considerable amounts of the CAMP LL-37, whereas loading was found to be much lower for non-porous or positively charged SiNPs. The results also demonstrated that due to preferential pore localization, anionic mesoporous particles, but not the other particles, protects LL-37 from degradation by infection-related proteases. For anionic SiNPs, membrane disruption is mediated almost exclusively by peptide release. In contrast, non-porous SiNPs built up a resilient LL-37 surface coating due to their higher negative surface charge, and display largely particle-mediated membrane interactions and antimicrobial effects. For positively charged mesoporous SiNPs, LL-37 incorporation promoted the membrane binding and disruption displayed by the particles in the absence of peptide, but also caused toxicity against human erythrocytes. Thus, the use of mesoporous SiNPs as AMP delivery systems requires consideration of membrane interactions and selectivity of both free peptide and the peptide-loaded NPs [46] . The properties of AMPs adsorbed on inorganic or organic surfaces are of interest for their potential applications in intracellular drug delivery. In the work of Syryamina et al., continuous-wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) techniques were applied to study the adsorption of the AMPs trichogin GA IV and ampullosporin A on monodisperse colloidal silica nanospheres (SiNS) of 20 nm diameter [47] . The results obtained by CW EPR supported the view that the adsorbed peptides form close-packed clusters. PELDOR data show that both trichogin and ampullosporin adsorbed on the silica surface possess a more disordered conformation as compared to that in solution. For ampullosporin, disordering is much more pronounced than for trichogin. After desorption, the peptides restored their conformations; upon adsorption, the peptides in some cases may lose partly their biradical character [47] .

Higher adsorption at room temperature of nisin and pediocin was obtained on bentonite. The antimicrobial activity of the resultant bacteriocin-nano-clay systems was analysed using skimmed milk agar as food simulant, and the largest inhibition zones were observed against Gram-positive bacteria for halloysite samples. Bacteriocins were intercalated into the interlayer space of montmorillonites as deduced from the increase of the basal spacing measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) assay.

[99] D'Angelo et al. designed and developed a system of nano-embedded microparticles (NEM) for sustained delivery of cationic AMPs (CAMPs) [94] in the lung, studying its effect on P. aeruginosa, a known lung infection pathogen. To this purpose, PLGA NPs containing a model CAMP, colistin (Col), were produced by the emulsion/solvent diffusion technique, and then spray-dried in different carriers (lactose or mannitol), thus producing NEM. The most promising NEM formulations were selected from bulk and flow properties, distribution of NPs in the carrier and aerosolization performance upon delivery through a breath-actuated dry powder inhaler. Col-loaded NEM were found to kill P. aeruginosa biofilms and to display a prolonged efficacy compared to the free Col. [94] . Another CAMP, plectasin, was encapsulated into PLGA NPs using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method, in the work of Water et al. [23] The plectasin-loaded NPs displayed a high encapsulation efficiency (71-90%) and mediated release of the peptide over 24 h. The antimicrobial efficacy was investigated using bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cell monolayers infected with S. aureus, and encapsulated plectasin displayed improved efficacy as compared to non-encapsulated plectasin. The author also assessed the subcellular localization of the prepared NPs in different relevant cell lines: Calu-3 epithelial cells, THP-1 macrophages and A549 epithelial cells. Here the results have shown good patterns of penetration on Calu-3 epithelial cell lines, as well as in THP-1 macrophages [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 164, "text": "[98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 447, "end": 451, "text": "[94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1078, "text": "[94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1223, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1868, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pectin nanoparticles"}, {"text": "Hydrogels and nanogels are an important class of biomaterials that have been widely utilized for a variety of biomedical/medical applications. The biological performance of these systems, particularly those used as wound dressing; can be complemented with antimicrobial activity capable of preventing colonization of the wound site by opportunistic bacterial pathogens [90, 100, 101] . These types of structures have also been studied recently for AMP delivery. Continuing their study of the antimicrobial activity of multi-domain CAMPs (MD-CAMPs) in solution, Jiang et al. investigated the same effect of self-assembled 3-D hydrogels supramolecular nanostructures and its rheological properties [95] . Among the studied MD-CAMPs solutions, the bactericidal activity of peptide hydrogels was found to be improved. The improved antimicrobial activity of the self-assembled peptide hydrogels was found to be related to the combined effect of supramolecular surface chemistry and storage modulus of the bulk materials, rather than the ability of individual peptides/peptide assemblies to penetrate bacterial cell membrane as observed in solution. Thus, the structure-property-activity relationship developed through this study may provide important knowledge for designing biocompatible peptide hydrogels with built-in antimicrobial activity for various biomedical applications [95] . The Water et al. group also designed novel nanogel-based novicidin delivery system. The peptide novicidin was self-assembled with a nano-ctenyl succinic anhydride-modified analogue of hyaluronic acid, and this formulation was optimized using a microfluidics-based quality-by-design approach. The encapsulation efficiency of novicidin (15-71%) and the zeta potential (\u221224 to \u221257 mV) of the nanogels could be tailored by changing the preparation process parameters, with a maximum peptide loading of 36 \u00b1 4%. The nanogels exhibited good colloidal stability under different ionic strength conditions and allowed complete release of the peptide over 14 days. Furthermore, self-assembly of novicidin with hyaluronic acid into nanogels significantly improved the safety profile at least five-fold and six-fold when tested in HUVECs and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively, while showing no loss of antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. aureus [96] . Li et al. explored the potential application of AMPs in wound healing, by developing a biodegradable poly(L-lactic acid)-Pluronic L35-poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA-L35-PLLA) in situ gel-forming system [97] . An injectable formulation composed of human AMPs 57 (AP-57) loaded NPs, and thermosensitive hydrogel was prepared. AP-57 peptides were enclosed with biocompatible NPs (AP-57-NPs) with high drug loading and encapsulation efficiency. AP-57-NPs were further encapsulated in a thermosensitive hydrogel (AP-57-NPs-H) to facilitate its application in cutaneous wound repair. As a result, AP-57-NPs-H released AP-57 in an extended period and exhibited quite low cytotoxicity and high anti-oxidant activity in vitro. The in vivo wound healing assay using a full-thickness dermal defect model of SD rats indicated that AP-57-NPs-H could significantly promote wound healing. At day 14 after an operation, the treated group showed nearly complete wound closure of 96, 78 \u00b1 3, 12% [97] . Other studies of nisin nanoencapsulation were performed, with the purpose of protection to ensure the stability of this AMP during food processing and storage period. Nisin-loaded pectin NPs (NLP-NPs) were prepared and analysed by Krivirotova et al. by a simple complexation method [98] . Three types of pectin biopolymer were tested and it was found that the methoxylation degree of pectin influenced nisin loading efficiency and particle size. For the complex formation, both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were important. NLP-NPs exhibited antimicrobial activity that was dependent on the type of biopolymer. Overall, the results indicated that NLP-NPs might be a suitable antimicrobial system to be used in the food industry [98] . Nisin nanoencapsulation in self-assembly chitosan-and poly-glutamic acid, was recently reported by Wu et al. [99] . Herein, the authors showed that the use of a coating layer of chitosan improved colloidal stability, loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency. Furthermore, chitosan layer composite nanoparticles were more effective compared to uncoated NPs and nisin in inhibiting the growth of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[90,", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "100,", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 379, "end": 383, "text": "101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 696, "end": 700, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1379, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 2319, "end": 2323, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2523, "end": 2527, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 3299, "end": 3303, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 3588, "end": 3592, "text": "[98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 4047, "end": 4051, "text": "[98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 4163, "end": 4167, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pectin nanoparticles"}, {"text": "Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) stand for nanoparticles composed of lipid materials that melt at temperatures above 40 \u2022 C [102] .

They exhibit distinct mechanisms of action and may show additional biological activities, e.g., as signalling molecules and biomarkers, and even as tumoricidal agents. AMPs, however, show low stability and bioavailability. The formulation of AMPs into nanomaterials seems to offer a very appealing and effective manner to improve these limitations, and several systems have been designed and studied for this purpose (e.g., inorganic, polymeric and lipid nanoparticles, carbon dots and dendrimers). However, concerns on how to regulate the distribution of nanomaterials in the body or specific organs are also raised. Nano-drugs are foreign substances to the body and may produce inflammation. Therefore, safety data for long-term therapy or repeated dosage are needed to circumvent the potential risk. Biodegradable nanomaterials have been proposed to reduce the risk of toxicological events both in vitro and in vivo. To date, few studies have investigated the toxicological and environmental effects of direct and indirect exposure to nanomaterials, and no clear guidelines exist to quantify these effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing guidelines, which can assure the safe use of nanomaterials. Moreover, more powerful ex vivo models or animal models are needed to assess the safety issues and to comply with government regulations. How to extend the shelf life of nanodrugs is also a problem due to their agglomeration also being a problem. The production methods for nanostructures should also be improved, and scalable studies for industrial production are also of great importance in order to promote cost effectiveness of these new formulations. The cost and production of nanomaterials on a large scale is one of the hurdles in effective implementation of these products. Hence, the scientific community should also pay attention to developing affordable methodologies so that nanotechnology can reach patients. In conclusion, it seems that, although the promising research results in this area are rising, it is also urgent to start directing efforts in making these new drug formulations a reality as therapeutic agents.
