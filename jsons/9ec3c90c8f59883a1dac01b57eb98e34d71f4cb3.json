            "text": "As part of a wider study examining regeneration pathways in monsoon rain forest vegetation in northern Australia, a one-off, dry season census of saplings was undertaken along transects sampled at each of 33 relatively undisturbed sites broadly representative of the range of regional monsoon rain forest vegetation. Four floristic quadrat groups were derived through TWINSPAN classification. Subsequent analyses involved: (1) comparison of mean dry season stockings of juveniles occurring in different rain forest types, and their structural and environmental correlates; (2) comparison of the contributions of different life forms, and the influence of clonal reproduction in the sapling regeneration banks of different forest types; and (3) exploration of relationships between the distributions of saplings of common tree species with respect to seed bank, floristic, structural, and environmental variables. While data presented here require cautious interpretation given that processes of seedling/sapling recruitment and mortality are highly dynamic, sapling banks were found to be most dense on coarse-textured, moist soils, and least dense on coarse-textured, seasonally dry soils. Canopy cover and fire impact were shown to be highly influential on sapling distribution, especially for saplings of tree species and those growing on seasonally dry sites. Sapling densities were little influenced by proximity to rain forest margins, except for shrubs. The potential for clonal reproduction was significantly greater on dry sites, especially for trees. The majority of saplings sampled were derived from relatively few common, non-clonal, canopy tree species. Sapling distributions of 20 out of 23 common tree species were clumped in the vicinity of conspecific adults; for most species the strength of this relationship was greater than that for any other variable. These data support observations in the literature concerning the distribution of sapling banks in moist and dry tropical forests.",

            "text": "Considerable attention has been given in recent years to the study of seedling and sapling regeneration in tropical rain forest systems. Such work has contributed significantly, for example, to the development of explanatory models for the maintenance of species diversity, gap-phase dynamics, and the elucidation of regenerative pathways in tropical forests generally. With respect to disturbance regimes, it is now well documented that regeneration in small canopy gaps occurs primarily through release of established seedlings and advanced regeneration whereas, in large gaps, regeneration of most tree species occurs through soil-stored seed (e.g. Whitmore 1983 Whitmore , 1984 Denslow 1987) . Where largescale disturbance occurs as a result of clearing, burning, and extensive storm damage, regeneration from stem coppice is also of importance (e.g. Stocker 1981; Uhl et al. 1981; Murphy & Lugo 1986; Bowman 1991a; Kauffman 1991; Yih et al. 1991; Rico-Gray & Garcia-Franco 1992) . Despite this growing understanding, limited work has been undertaken to date on the dynamics and regeneration pathways of closed forest vegetation in the markedly seasonal tropics (Murphy & Lugo 1986; Gerhardt & Hytteborn 1992) .",

Full description of the study region, including climate, soils, and rain forest vegetation, is given in Russell-Smith (1991) . Of particular relevance is the restriction of rainfall to the summer months, principally November through March, associated with the arrival of the monsoon. Rainfall declines steeply over the latitudinal range of rain forest vegetation (12 -18 \u00b0S), from ca. 2000 mm/yr in the northwest to 600 mm/yr in the south. While the amount of rainfall received in any one area is highly variable from year to year, the annual wet season is a highly reliable event (Taylor & Tulloch 1985) .",

While boundaries between rain forest and surrounding savanna vegetation types typically are abrupt, floristic and structural transitions (ecotones) are more frequently observed at moist sites and occur over distances mostly less than 50 m (Bowman 1992) . Rain forest vegetation occupies a variety of land forms, including small perennial springs; seasonally flooded riparian habitats; and, most typically, excessively-drained substrates such as coastal dunes, deeply weathered lateritic surfaces, igneous outcrops, and actively eroding sandstone escarpments. The regional rain forest flora comprises a total of ca. 650 species (Liddle et al. 1994) ; mean species richness in 16 floristic vegetation types ranged from 24 to 106 species per patch (Russell-Smith 1991).",

Conversely, rain forest sapling density is shown to be strongly negatively correlated with increasing fire damage, flammable grasses, and increasing rockiness and slope. Similarly, densities of rain forest tree and palm saplings were strongly associated with better developed forest sites (Table 3) . By contrast, saplings of shrub species tended to be located in lower, more open canopy rain forest vegetation exhibiting greater incidence of fire damage. Vine saplings showed no clear habitat preferences other than for non-rocky sites with deeper soils (Table 3) . Additionally, with the notable exception of shrub saplings, whose distribution was shown to be strongly correlated with rain forest margins, significant relationships were not demonstrated between RFSPL with increasing distance from rain forest patch margins, both for RFSPL in total or separately for each Group (Table 2) , nor for trees, palms or vines (Table 3) .

Of 249 woody rain forest species sampled in this study, two thirds (164) are non-clonal species which regenerate from seed only (Table 4 ). Most of these (100) are trees. A further 76 species are clonal species which potentially may reproduce from seed or clonal resprout; the regenerative status of another seven species is unknown.

Sapling densities of all but three of these 23 tree species were strongly correlated with the distributions of adults of the same species as measured by conspecific basal area or stem density, typically both (Table 5) . Further, for most species the strength of the correlation between sapling density and the distribution of conspecific adults was greater than that for any other measured environmental variable. Species not shown to conform to this pattern comprised Buchanania arborescens, Carallia brachiata and Pouteria sericea.

First, this study reports a one-off regional survey of rain forest saplings at each of 33 little-disturbed sample sites. Processes of rain forest seedling/ sapling recruitment and mortality are typically highly dynamic even in relatively undisturbed tropical forest types, especially following mast fruiting events (e.g. Fox 1973; Liew & Wong 1973; Hubbell & Foster 1990; Lieberman et al. 1990; Swaine et al. 1990; Turner 1990a, b; Welden et al. 1991; Lieberman & Li 1992; De Steven 1994) . Such dynamism applies particularly to seedlings, with relatively greater population stability exhibited in older (generally taller) size classes (e.g. Lieberman et al. 1990; Swaine et al. 1990; Turner 1990a; DeSteven 1994) .

Consider the following definitions: seedlings are recently emerged germinants (Ng 1980) , recently emerged germinants up to 64 weeks old (Osunkjoya et al. 1993) , up to 2 yrs old (Lieberman & Li 1992) , < 50 cm (De Steven 1994), < 2 m (Russell-Smith et al. 1993) , undefined (Fox 1973; Liew & Wong 1973; Swaine et al. 1990; Turner 1990a) ; seedlings and saplings are individuals < 1m (Martinez-Ramos & Soto-Castro 1993); saplings are individuals \u2265 50cm height to 1 cm DBH (DeSteven 1994), > 2 m height to < 5cm DBH (Williams-Linera 1990), \u2265 2 m height to 10 cm DBH (Russell-Smith et al. 1993 ), 1-4 cm DBH (Welden et al. 1991) , 1 -8 cm DBH (Hubbell & Foster 1990) . Seedlings are strictly germinants still attached to seed tissues (ie. cotyledons). Here, saplings are defined as established juveniles (ie. without cotyledons) covering a range of height and stem development up to an arbitrary 5 cm DBH. Further, height is an inadequate surrogate of the developmental age or status of saplings. This applies particularly to low individuals growing on seasonally dry sites where aerial shoots may have been killed by fire or other periodic disturbance, only to be replaced in the following growing season by resprouts from subterranean lignotuberous tissues (e.g. Lacey & Whelan 1976; Lacey & Johnston 1990) .",

For each species, correlations are presented for the TWINSPAN Group containing the most quadrats in which saplings of respective species were recorded; for four species (indicated by a after the species name) with low frequencies of sapling occurrence, correlations are presented over all Groups. Numbers of quadrats in which saplings of respective species were recorded are given for the TWINSPAN Group containing most quadrats, and, in parentheses, for total quadrat frequency.

Such results are surprising given steep gradients in light and other microclimate conditions prevailing on, or near the margin itself (e.g. Denslow 1987; Williams-Linera 1990; MacDougall & Kellman 1992; Brown 1993) , not to mention the impact of recurrent fires. Nevertheless, light availability and fire impact were shown to be highly influential on the distribution of saplings under prevailing monsoonal climatic conditions (Tables 2 and 3) .",

Analagous comparative data in the literature are scarce, although Liew & Wong (1973) note that, for dipterocarp forests under ever-wet conditions in Sabah, seedling stockings are typically greatest on sandstone ridges and volcanic soils, and, together with Fox (1973) , are least dense in swampy forests and riverain situations.",

In semideciduous forest and thicket vegetation (sensu Webb 1968; Group 3), where saplings of common tree species account for only a small proportion of the whole, there is increased capacity for clonal reproduction and species with dormant seeds dominate the sapling bank. Evergreen forest and woodland vegetation (Group 4) provides a special case given that it is dominated by just one species, Allosyncarpia. As for Group 3, however, but with the notable exception of Allosyncarpia itself, there is generally increased capacity for clonal reproduction, and species with dormant seeds dominate the sapling bank. of Allosyncarpia ternata, the major canopy dominant of harsh, seasonally dry sandstone habitats, shaded sites are physiologically essential for the establishment of juveniles (e.g. Bowman 1991b), as well as affording safer haven from fires given reduced grassy fuels (Russell-Smith et al. 1993) . Overall, the data express greater potential for clonal reproduction on seasonally dry sites, especially for trees (Table 4 ). Similar observations have been made by Ewel (1977) and Lieberman & Li (1992) concerning regeneration of dry forest in other tropical regions. Such generalisation, however, masks considerable variability between different lifeforms; for example, larger proportions of shrub and vine species are clonal than are tree species.",

Russell-Smith & Lee 1992) . Similar observations have been made for clumping of juveniles growing in seasonal (Hubbell & Foster 1990) , and markedly seasonal (Hubbell 1979 ) rain forest in central America. While the sapling distributions of three common tree species were not correlated with that of conspecific adults, it is equally possible that the sampling design itself was inadequate; thus, narrow transects of 10 m width may not have been sufficient to capture both saplings and nearby conspecific adult stems, especially those with wide canopies.",

The present study, also conducted in relatively undisturbed situations over a range of regional rain forest sites, focuses on the pool of juveniles established on the forest floor. Regeneration in small canopy gaps is conventionally considered to derive from this pool (e.g. Denslow 1987; Uhl et al. 1988) , with relatively little contribution from the soil seed bank (Hopkins & Graham 1984) .",
