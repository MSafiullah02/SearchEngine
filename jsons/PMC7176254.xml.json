For infectious diseases, one must study the circumstances under which both infection and disease occur, for these may be different. Infection is the consequence of an encounter of a potentially pathogenic microorganism with a susceptible human host through an appropriate portal of entry and usually involves a demonstrable host response to the agent. Exposure is the key factor, and the sources of infection lie mostly outside the individual human host, within the environment, or in other infected hosts. Disease represents one of the possible consequences of infection, and the factors important in its development are mostly intrinsic to the host, although the dosage and virulence of the infecting microbe play a role. These intrinsic factors include the age at the time of infection, the portal of entry, the presence or absence of immunity, the vigor of the primary defense system, the efficiency and nature of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, the genetic makeup of the host, the state of nutrition, the presence of other diseases, and psychosocial influences. These factors that result in the occurrence of clinical illness among those infected have been called the \u201cclinical illness-promotion factors,\u201d(3) and many of them remain unknown. The host responses can include death, the classic clinical features of the disease, mild or atypical forms, subclinical and inapparent infections, and the carrier state, which may exist in the absence of a detectable host response. While the clinician is primarily concerned with disease, the epidemiologist is interested in both infection and disease. Infection without disease is a common phenomenon, so that a study limited to clinical illness alone would give an incomplete epidemiological picture and would be a poor basis for control and prevention.(4) A full understanding involves the pathogenesis of the process leading to clinical disease both in the community and in the individual.",

This book will attempt to cover both these aspects. While the \u201cepidemiology of infectious diseases\u201d has disappeared from the curriculum of many schools of medicine and public health in developed countries, the current epidemic of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has reawakened interest in the subject. In addition, the emergence of new diseases such as Legionnaires\u2019 disease, Lyme disease, the toxic shock syndrome and the development of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci and tubercle bacilli, the appearance of erythrogenic streptococci (\u201cflesh-eating\u201d streptococci) and a new cholera strain termed 0139, foodborne outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7, and a large waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis are among the \u201cemerging infections\u201d that continue to pose challenges to epidemiologists(10) and for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are developing preventive strategies.(11) It is becoming apparent that in developed countries, the continuing, and in some instances the increasing, importance of infectious diseases is causing concern among public health authorities.",

In infectious disease epidemiology, it may be possible to identify the persons in the cohort who are susceptible or immune at the start of the study by measuring the presence or absence of antibody in the initial serum specimens. Serial serum samples are then taken in which the appearance of antibody indicates the approximate time at which infection occurs.

Serological techniques are useful in defining the incidence, clinical importance, and spectrum of illness of a new agent such as Legionella pneumophila. The presence of antibody or antitoxin to diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, as determined in a serological study, is a good reflection of the level of immunization and public health practice in a community. This is especially true of tetanus, since antitoxin is acquired almost solely through immunization and rarely, if at all, through natural infection. The use of serological surveys in areas where medical care, diagnostic facilities, and reporting practices are inadequate may provide information essential for the control and evaluation of immunization programs.

Five circumstances in which epidemics occur can be mentioned: first, when a new group of susceptibles is introduced into a setting where a disease is endemic; second, when a new source of infection is introduced into an area from which the microbial agent has been absent and many susceptibles are therefore present, as in the return of visitors from a foreign country, or the arrival of new immigrants, or the contamination of food, water, or other sources of exposure by an agent not normally present; third, when effective contact is made between a preexisting infection of low endemicity with susceptible persons as a result of changes in social, behavioral, sexual, or cultural practices. Crowding as in a prison camp or institution or exposure of a new portal of entry are examples. A fourth possibility is an increased susceptibility to infection or disease or both through immunosuppression or other factors that influence the host response, such as a preceding viral infection, nutritional disorder, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, or presence of a chronic disease. The devastating effect of HIV on the immune system has resulted in a worldwide epidemic of enormous and increasing proportions. A fifth circumstance might be the increase in the virulence or dosage of a microbial agent. This may have accounted for the massive outbreak of waterborne Cryptosporidium infection that occurred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in March\u2013April 1993, which involved 404,000 infected persons of whom 4,400 required hospitalization.(28)",

In the latter setting, variations in the epidemic curve could result from differences in the dosage and time of occurrence of the microbial contaminant in the common vehicle or in the amount consumed, or they could result from changes in the frequency of exposure of the persons at risk to infection. The secondary spread of certain infectious agents from human to human in a common-source outbreak will also alter the epidemic curve, often producing a group of scattered cases after the initial epidemic wave subsides; these are called secondary cases and can lead to tertiary cases.",

Here, the epidemic curve depends on the number of susceptibles, the degree of contact with an infected host, the incubation period of the disease, the mechanism of transmission, the portal of entry, and the infectiousness of the causative agent. In either common-source or propagated outbreaks, the epidemic decreases or stops when (1) the number of susceptibles effectively exposed to the source is diminished by natural attrition, by immunization, by antibiotic prophylactics, or by actual development of the disease itself; (2) the source of infection is eliminated; or (3) the means of transmission is interrupted.",

In the absence of a specific diagnosis, a simple working definition of a case should be established on the basis of available clinical and epidemiological data. It should be concise and clear-cut. The number of such cases should then be determined by a quick telephone or record survey of hospitals, clinics, and appropriate practicing physicians in the area.

No other dormitories were involved, and the cases were sharply limited in time. The epidemic curve shown in Figure 1 indicates a peak incubation of 14 h. Stool specimens were obtained both from ill and healthy students and from food handlers. Samples of leftover items of food were not available; however, refrigerated samples of routinely collected food items were found for testing. Food menus for the preceding evening revealed that the three dining halls in which ill students had eaten offered a choice of fish or roast beef with gravy, whereas the other three dining halls had a choice of hamburger or fish; the other food items were common to all six dining halls. On the basis of this preliminary assessment, the hypothesis was formulated that this was a foodborne outbreak due to an agent with an average incubation period of about 14 h (range 10\u201320 h) that was present in or introduced into one or more of the food items served exclusively in the three dining halls where students became ill. The laboratory was notified of this as a guide to its tests. For more intensive investigation, questionnaires concerning foods eaten, time of onset, and the clinical symptoms were distributed to both sick and well students who ate in the three dining halls. They were returned by 366 ill and 740 well students, representing all the ill and two thirds of the well students. The clinical data indicated that the illness lasted less than 24 h and was characterized mainly by diarrhea; about half the ill students complained of abdominal cramps. Nausea, vomiting, and fever were rare. The average incubation period was too long for a staphylococcal toxin, and the clinical features would be unusual for Salmonella or Shigella.\n\n",

The gravy as well as other foods available was negative on aerobic and anaerobic culture. Mouse-inoculation tests for toxin in the gravy were also negative; however, it was not known whether the gravy sample tested was from the incriminated meal or was set aside from a fresh gravy preparation. Laboratory analysis of fecal samples yielded the answer. Stool specimens from 19 of 20 ill students were positive for heat-resistant Clostridium perfringens, as was 1 of 24 stools from food handlers; no stools from 13 healthy students who had not eaten beef with gravy were positive. The organisms were isolated in thioglycollate broth after being heated 1 h in a boiling water bath. It was learned later that approximately 27 gal of bone beef stock had been kept overnight in the refrigerator in 9 gal plastic bags, mixed with 7 gal of fresh beef stock the next day, heated to a rolling boil, and served separately from the roast beef. Apparently, the inadequate heating of a heat-resistant preformed toxin in a very large volume of fluid had failed to destroy it. The control measures instituted were to prohibit future use of leftover gravy stock and to heat all items in smaller containers. C. perfringens food poisoning has an incubation period of 8\u201322 h with a peak of 10\u201314 h, closely fitting the outbreak described.\n\n",

One is the infectiousness, expressed as the ratio: number infected/number susceptible and exposed. A second is pathogenicity, a term used to denote the potential for an infectious organism to induce disease. It can be expressed quantitatively as follows: number with disease/number infected. The determinants of pathogenicity include mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, bacteriophages, and transposons.(33) The pathogenic process is complex and represents sequence of events in which many components are involved.(34) The adherence of organisms to host surfaces is a highly specific and essential step for subsequent events to develop. Epithelial surfaces provide appropriate sites for many bacteria. M. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae find attachment sites in the respiratory epithelium, Neisseria gonorrhea in the urethral epithelium, and many enteric organisms (V. cholerae, E. coli, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexneri) in intestinal or colonic epithelium. Pathogenic organisms must possess characteristics that protect them against such host defenses as mucus and phagocytic cells. These protective features of the bacteria themselves include polysaccharide capsules (pneumococci, Klebsiella, Haemophilus), hyaluronic acid capsules and M proteins (\u03b2-hemolytic streptococci), and a surface polypeptide (B. anthracis). Toxins and certain extracellular enzymes may be important in the establishment of infection and in spread through tissues. The latter include collagenase (C. perfringens), coagulase (staphylococci), hyaluronidases (staphylococci, streptococci, clostridia, pneumococci), strepto-kinase or fibrinolysin (hemolytic streptococci), hemolysins and leukocydins (streptococci, staphylococci, clostridia, gram-negative rods), and proteases (Neisseria, streptococci) that can hydrolyze immunoglobulins, such as secretory IgA.(34) These surface properties and enzyme production contribute to the invasiveness of an organism.\n",

The exotoxins liberated by many gram-positive bacteria cause local cell and tissue injury; some damage phagocytic cells and thereby facilitate the spread of the organism. Examples include Clostridium welchii, Clostridium botulinum, C. tetanus\n, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, S. dysenteriae, V. cholerae, B. anthracis, Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus.(36) Some exotoxins are directly responsible for the characteristic clinical features of the disease, some are antiphagocytic, and some promote spread in tissues. They cause little or no fever in the host. Endotoxins are an integral part of the cell wall of gram-negative organisms. They are liberated in soluble form both during bacterial growth and presumably during death and disintegration of the organism. Endotoxins are strong immunologic adjuvants. They may produce fever in man and many other vertebrates; the pyrogenic action is mediated by a product synthesized by monocytes (\u201cendogenous pyrogen\u201d) that acts on the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus. Other endogenous agents, such as prostaglandins and catecholamines, may also play a role. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the most important component of endotoxin and is composed of a core polysaccharide common to many gram-negative bacteria, an O-specific polysaccharide conferring virulence and serological specificity, and a lipid A portion, mainly responsible for toxicity.(35) The effects of endotoxins appear to be mediated through leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and cachectin/TNF. Cachectin, which is identical to tumor necrosis factor,(37) is indistinguishable functionally from lymphotoxin, a product of activated T cells. This protein is produced by macrophages and by T cells in response to bacteria, viruses, and parasites and also occurs during cancers, resulting, in order of increasing dosage, in the following sequence of events: inflammation, cytotoxicity, cachexia, organ failure, irreversible shock, and death. There is a synergism between it and interleukin-1 in this phenomenon. Monoclonal antibody to cachectin/TNF can inhibit these responses and glucosteroids can also prevent endotoxin deaths. The gene for cachectin has been identified, and when put into hamster ovarian cells and then into nude mice results in cachexia. Despite these deleterious effects, cachectin/TNF in small doses appears to be beneficial in serving as a growth factor for macrophages and as a tissue remodeler, a role for which it may have been designed in nature. It is not clear whether all these effects are mediated directly by cachectin/TNF or through mediators released by them. With large doses of endotoxins, there is also an effect that produces vascular collapse and death. Unlike exotoxins, endotoxins are heat-stable and are not fully convertible to protective toxoids. Endotoxins are normally released by many gram-negative bacteria in the intestines of healthy individuals, presumably absorbed in small amounts, and degraded by the Kuppfer cells. This occurs without pathological consequences on a continual basis and has a beneficial effect in stimulating the development of the immune system in the immature individual.(33)",

They are highly antigenic and result in high titers of antitoxin that can neutralize the toxin. This antigenic property is useful in immunization with toxins rendered nontoxic by formalin, heat, and other methods. Different toxins produce disease via different mechanisms.(31) C. diphtheriae toxin results in inhibition of protein synthesis and necrosis of epithelium, heart muscle, kidney, and nerve tissues. The toxin of C. tetani reaches the central nervous system by retrograde axon transport where it increases reflex excitation in neurons of the spinal cord by blocking an inhibitor mediator. C. botulinum exerts its effect on the nervous system by blocking the release of acetylcholine at synapses and neuromuscular junction. Gut organisms, such as Clostridium difficile, produce a necrotizing toxin that leads to antibiotic-associated colitis, and that of S. aureus stimulates neural receptors from which impulses are transmitted to medullary centers controlling gut motility. V. cholerae toxin binds to ganglioside receptors on the villi of the small intestine, leading to a large increase in adenylate cyclase and AMP concentrations and the resulting massive hypersecretion of chloride and water and the impairment of absorption of sodium that characterizes the severe diarrhea and acidosis of cholera. Other toxins, such as that of hemolytic lysogenic streptococci, result in the punctate maculopapular rash of scarlet fever.",

In streptococcal infections, antibodies may develop against an unknown component of the organism that is antigenically similar to heart muscle, leading to myocarditis. Immune complexes may also form, deposit in the kidney, and result in glomerulonephritis. In infections due to M. pneumoniae, the production of \u201cheterophile\u201d antibodies against human O erythrocytes (cold agglutinins) occasionally leads to acute hemolytic anemia. In primary infections by M. tuberculosis, the pathological picture is dominated by a vigorous and persistent cell-mediated immune response to the invading organism. The inflammatory, pathological, and immunologic processes of the host culminating in disease may be detrimental both to the host and to the microorganism. A successful parasite is one that leads to the least host response. For a more detailed discussion of microbial virulence factors, readers are referred to recent texts on infectious diseases and microbiology(32,38) and to recent articles.(34,39)",

            "text": "The external environment provides the setting in which the agent and host usually interact and is the usual means of transmission between the two. The effects of the environment on the organism itself are discussed in Section 4.1. The environment also contains the physical and biological mechanisms required for spread. The former includes air, water, and food and the latter animal, bird, and insect vectors. For some bacterial infections, the primary host is not man but some other living creature in the environment. This includes anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, Q fever, bubonic plague, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, salmonellosis, and tularemia. For infections involving insect transmission such as louse-borne typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and bubonic plague, the humidity, temperature, vegetation, and other factors in the environment may play a central role in limiting the occurrence of the infection to well-defined geographic areas favorable to the vector. Through climatic factors, the environment exerts an influence on exposure of the host to microorganisms. Warm weather and tropical climates result in recreational and occupational exposures to water, sewage, swimming pools, wild animals, and insects; they promote spread of skin infections in unclothed persons with abrasions on their skin. Certain organisms grow or survive better in warmer environments, especially enteric organisms. Intestinal infections flourish under such conditions. Inadequate refrigeration leads to foodborne outbreaks. Epidemics of Legionnaires\u2019 disease appear to depend on a chain of warm weather events. These include appropriate temperature and humidity for the organism to grow in soil or water, the contamination of a water-cooling tower or air conditioner, and airborne carriage or propulsion of the organism to susceptible humans, frequently in an enclosed environment (e.g., hotel, hospital, institution, club); July and August are good months for this. The colder winter months, as well as school seasons in temperate climates of the northern hemisphere, bring individuals into close contact in a closed environment, facilitating spread of infections by the respiratory route. This includes bacterial infections of the central nervous system such as the meningococcus, H. influenzae, and pneumococcus organisms as well as true respiratory infections such as pertussis, bacterial and mycoplasmal pneumonias, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and streptococcal pharyngitis\u2013tonsillitis. The peak period of different disease varies from one season to another. For example, pertussis and M. pneumoniae infections tend to occur most commonly in the fall and streptococcal infections in the spring. In addition, longer-term temporal trends in infection and disease occur within the same environment (as discussed in Chapter 2, Section 8.2). These changes reflect the complex interplay of agent, host, and environment. New strains of the organism, environmental alterations, varying behavioral patterns of the host, and the degree of immunization practice may change the pattern from one season to another.",

In hospitals, certain types of skin, wound, and urinary infections are common, and their severity may be enhanced in persons who are already ill with another disease or are receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Antibiotic-resistant organisms are frequent in this setting. In prisons and in institutions for the mentally retarded or ill, low levels of personal hygiene and crowding contribute to the spread of respiratory, intestinal, and skin infections. Exposure in meatpacking and slaughterhouses or tanneries, or travel to developing countries, involves the risk of infection by various bacterial agents within that environment. With regard to children, the day-care center is posing an increasing hazard for them, as well as their parents for certain infectious diseases, especially respiratory and intestinal infections.(40) However, for young children infection is much more common than disease. For example, among 10,860 case contacts of an index case of H. influenzae type b infection in day-care centers, none of whom had received rifampin chemoprophylaxis, no clinical disease developed over an average 60-day observation period, although the carrier state was common.(41) Thus, rifampin prophylaxis of contacts may be unnecessary in these settings, although some other investigators disagree with this. For HIV infection, the environments of the brothel, the bar, and the bathhouse have provided ready transmission of this and other sexually transmitted infections, as has the \u201cshooting gallery\u201d of intravenous drug abusers. Travel to or residence in developing countries may result in exposure not only to specific tropical infections such as malaria, schistosomiasis, and cholera but also to many common respiratory and intestinal infections that the traveler might not encounter in a more hygienic setting. Even the homebody working in the garden or walking in the woods near home in endemic areas may be exposed to the bite of the deer tick or related species and become infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease.",

Bacterial organisms from ill persons or carriers exit via the gastrointestinal tract to the external milieu for transmission via water, food, or direct contact to another individual. They constitute a major group of bacterial infections. The mouth is the common portal of entry. Some enteric infections involve only a human-to-human cycle, such as cholera, typhoid fever, and shigellosis. Others, such as salmonellosis, Campylobacter infections, and yersiniosis, also involve animal hosts. A variety of mechanisms may transmit the organism from the infectious stool to a susceptible person. Cholera is commonly transmitted by water, and on occasion by food (such as undercooked seafood like oysters and clams). Shigellosis is spread by the fecal route from patients or carriers and also by food, water, or flies. Typhoid fever is transmitted by food or water contaminated by the feces or urine from a patient or carrier and sometimes through contaminated shellfish or canned goods. Salmonella organisms are widely disseminated in nature and infect many domestic animals and birds, providing many potential sources of contamination of food and, less commonly, of water. Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica also infect many animals, including domestic ones such as puppies, and can infect exposed humans through direct contact or through water, milk, or food. For shigellosis, exposure to an infected human during the acute illness or shortly thereafter is the main source of infection; here, direct or indirect fecal\u2013oral contact is usually more important than water or food.

            "text": "Many bacterial infections produce diseases through the cells with which they first come in contact in skin or epithelial surfaces and remain limited to that area. Tissue damage results from the direct action of the bacteria, microbial toxins, indirect injury, inflammation, or immunopathologic processes. Most bacteria have specific attachment sites on epithelial surfaces (see Section 4.2). Examples of localized infections include diphtheria and streptococcal infections of the throat, gonococcal infections of the conjunctiva or urethra, cholera, and most Salmonella infections of the intestine. Many gram-negative bacteria have a limited capacity to invade tissues and tend to remain localized; some are able to invade only in debilitated, malnourished, or immunocompromised patients. Host antibacterial forces limit the spread of many bacteria. At the subepithelial level, three important defense mechanisms are called into play: (1) tissue fluids, (2) the lymphatic system leading to the lymph nodes, and (3) phagocytic cells (macrophages) in tissues and polymorphonuclear cells in the blood. Each of these mechanisms depends on the inflammatory response for its action,(35) as manifested by four cardinal signs: warmth and redness due to vasodilatation, swelling (vasodilatation and exudate), and pain (tissue distention, pain mediators). Polymorphonuclear cells enter, as well as macrophages and lymphocytes; exudation occurs. Tissue fluids provide plasma proteins, including immunoglobulins, such as IgG, complement, and properdin. The primary mediators of inflammation include histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and kinins. Prostaglandins E and F are thought to play a role in the termination of the response. Microorganisms in peripheral lymphatics are rapidly carried to lymph nodes, where they are exposed to macrophages lining the sinus that act as a bacterial filter. Here, too, polymorphs, serum factors accumulating during inflammation, and the initiation of the immune response limit the infection. The phagocytic cells play a key role in the interaction with microorganisms, ingesting and killing bacterial invaders. Among the chemotractant factors for phagocytosis are platelet-activating factors, leukotriene B4, C5a, and certain formyl peptides.(33) The details are fully described by Mims,(32,36) as are the ways in which some bacteria are able to resist or interfere with phagocytic activity. Organisms that escape must still face one or two encounters with the macrophages, as well as other immune mechanisms, before successfully reaching the venous system.",

The bacteremia may be transient and with little or no systemic response, as follows dental extraction in a healthy person; even a continuous bacteremia may exist with few toxic signs, as in leprosy where the organism exists in large numbers inside blood monocytes. On the other hand, severe systemic manifestations may accompany the presence of large numbers of organisms in the blood such as the pneumococcus, meningococcus, or group A S. pyogenes. This is called a septicemia. Bacteria may succeed in setting up foci of infection in areas where the blood flow is slow enough, or they may establish multiplication in sites previously damaged by disease or injury, such as Streptococcus viridans on abnormal heart valves producing subacute bacterial endocarditis, or staphylococci in the traumatized long bones of children may lead to osteomyelitis. Depending on the site of the infection, the liver and lung may receive many organisms during bacterial invasion of the bloodstream. The lung, liver, spleen, and bone marrow may also serve as important foci of dissemination of organisms, as in brucellosis, leptospirosis, and typhoid fever. Rashes accompany the dissemination of many viral and some bacterial infections to the skin. They may result from localization and growth of the organism in small blood vessels, producing thrombosis, infarction, and hemorrhage as in the rickettsial diseases, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and typhus, as well as the petechial and purpuric lesions of meningococcemia. Immunopathologic processes involving sensitized lymphocytes, antibodies, and immune complexes play a role in many rashes, especially viral. A bacterial toxin may induce the rash as in scarlet fever.

In the circulation, IgM occurs as a pentamer, with five identical subunit antibodies bound together by a protein called J chain. IgM is the predominant antibody produced during the first exposure to an antigen. In serum, pentameric IgM has the highest binding avidity of any of the isotypes of immunoglobulin. It is extremely efficient at agglutinating bacteria and is an excellent opsonin, promoting phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. In addition, IgM is the most effective antibody at activating complement.\nIgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin in serum, making up 75% of the total serum antibody. It is the predominant antibody produced in a secondary or anamnestic immune response. Four distinct subclasses of IgG are recognized. All four subclasses of IgG can activate the complement cascade, although with widely different efficiencies. In addition, specific receptors for the constant region of all four IgG subclasses have been identified on a variety of cell types, including macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. The combination of antibody with these other cell types either confers opsonic capacity or leads (in the presence of specific antigen) to the release of mediators. On lymphocytes, the binding of immunoglobulin molecules to such receptors appears to have regulatory functions, such as switching off the secretion of antibody. IgG is the only immunoglobulin that is capable of crossing the placenta, a process that is mediated by a specific receptor for IgG located on placental cells. In addition to its other activities, IgG is the most important neutralizing antibody in the serum, by virtue of its relative abundance.\nIgA is the principal antibody found in local secretions. IgA antibody can be found in tears, saliva, milk, sweat, lungs, nasal passages, the urogenital tract, and the gut. IgA plays a crucial role in the defense of mucosal surfaces, neutralizing bacteria and viruses at local mucosa before they have an opportunity to invade. The presence of large quantities of IgA antibody in milk and colostrum enables the efficient transfer of maternal humoral immunity to newborn infants. IgA is incapable of fixing complement. It serves primarily as an agglutinating and neutralizing antibody.IgA in local secretions occurs as a dimer, bound by J chain. IgA transport to local mucosa is mediated by a molecule called the secretory piece, produced by cells adjacent to mucosal sites. IgA associates with the secretory piece on the cell surface and is endocytosed, transported across the cytoplasm, and deposited at local mucosa.\nIgE makes up less than 0.01% of the total serum antibody. IgE is best recognized for its role in mediating immediate-type hypersensitivity, caused by the degranulation of mast cells and basophils in various mucosal tissues. IgE has an important role in the response against parasites. The purpose of the release of vasoactive substances when IgE bound to the surface of a mast cell or basophil encounters antigen is to enhance the accessibility of neutrophils and eosinophils, serum IgG, and complement to the site of parasitic infection.\nIgD has no direct role in mediating defense against infectious diseases. It is present, together with monomeric IgM, on the surface of all naive B lymphocytes and appears to have a role in primary B lymphocyte activation.\n",

            "text": "The second compartment of antigen-specific immunity is cell-mediated immunity (CMI). It is mediated by T lymphocytes. T cells are superficially indistinguishable from B cells. The T-cell receptor for antigen is structurally similar to the B-cell receptor, and yet the two cell types recognize specific antigen in fundamentally different ways. B cells recognize intact antigen and respond with the production of molecules that bear an exact copy of the surface receptor\u2019s binding site. T cells have no capacity for recognizing intact antigen. To engage a T-cell receptor, antigen first must be processed into small peptides, which are then inserted into the binding cleft of a major histo-compatibility (MHC) antigen. The MHC antigens are a highly polymorphic family of dual polypeptide proteins, at least some of which are expressed on nearly every cell type in the body. Because there are at least several hundred allelic variants of MHC antigens, and because no human being can express more than 12 different variants (up to two each of six different subclasses), the likelihood of two randomly selected individuals expressing the same panel of MHC antigens is remote in the extreme. Thus, the MHC antigens expressed by an individual to a very large extent define the property of self. This is particularly true for T cells. During the process of maturation in the thymus, nascent T cells undergo a rigorous selection process, and only cells displaying an antigen receptor that has a weak binding affinity for one or more self-MHC antigens are permitted to complete their differentiation into mature T cells. Cells with no affinity for self and cells with too strong an affinity, i.e., strong enough to activate a T cell on its own, are destroyed. When a foreign peptide is inserted into the cleft of an MHC molecule, its affinity is altered. A small number of T cells, perhaps one in half a million, will bind to this altered MHC with a high enough affinity to activate. Thus, T cells are able to recognize and respond to minute changes in the normal display of self, as represented by an individual\u2019s unique collection of MHC molecules.",

The first, cytotoxic T-cell-mediated lysis, is mediated primarily by the subset of T cells that express the protein CD8 on their surfaces. These T cells are restricted to their recognition of foreign peptide on the surface of a class I MHC molecule, which are present on most of the body\u2019s cells. Once activated, these cells recognize their specific combination of foreign peptide and MHC on a target cell and have two methods for dispatching the target. The first involves the deposition of perforin pores, which bear a striking resemblance to the terminal complement complex, onto the surface of the cell. The second approach is to induce apoptosis in the target, directing the cell to essentially commit suicide. Both processes result in the destruction of the target cell. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), by virtue of their ability to discern the presence of foreign peptides from microbial pathogens inside of a cell, are ideally suited for the elimination of intracellular parasites such as viruses. They are also considered to have an important role in the elimination of tumor cells.",

Class II MHC antigens are normally expressed on only a few populations of cells in the body, chiefly B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. All of these cell types are capable antigen-presenting cells, since CD4+ T cells also have the central role in the regulation of T-cell responses; the limited expression of class II antigens in the body is thought to reflect a safety restraint aimed at limiting the responsiveness of immune cells. In addition to providing helper activity to both B and T cells, CD4+ T cells are typically recruited to the site of tissue damage and infection, where they coordinate and amplify the effectiveness of both specific and nonspecific arms of the immune system.",

While it provides an invaluable service in the defense against microbial invasion and the spontaneous development of neoplastic cells, extremely tight controls are required to ensure that its activities do not escalate to the point where they become deleterious to the host. As such, the level of intercellular interaction in the immune system is extraordinarily high. As mentioned previously, B-cell responses are generally not possible in the absence of T-cell help. If specific cytokines, such as IL-2 for proliferation, are not made available to the antigen-stimulated B cell, a suboptimal response will result. The generation of T-cell help, in turn, is absolutely dependent on the presence of a suitable antigen-presenting-cell-bearing peptide on a class II MHC antigen. Thus, the participation of at least three different cell types is required to mount an effective immunoglobulin response to antigen. Similarly, a CTL response requires the participation of both a helper T cell and an antigen-presenting T cell for the activation of both T-cell help and the naive CTL.",

At last count, there are at least several functionally distinct subsets of helper T cells, a similar number of suppressor T cells, and so forth. In addition, functionality among T cells does not appear to be set in stone. There are circumstances in which CD4+ T cells perform cytotoxic function and population of CD8+ T cells that serve various regulatory functions. Thus, the complexity of interaction among cells in the human immune system is quite high, and a meaningful discussion of the current, admittedly limited, level of understanding of those interactions is beyond the scope of this overview.

The two extremes of the philosophical argument went as follows: (1) One\u2019s genetic material contains the information required to encode all one billion different specificities for foreign antigen, and selects from that collection of genes in a random fashion; and (2) the genetic material encodes for only a few antigen receptor genes and the rest of the diversity results from extraordinarily high rates of mutation.

The immunoglobulin genes and T-cell receptor genes are assembled from randomly selected segments into a single functional gene. The construction of variable region (which encodes the antigen binding site) of a heavy chain gene, for example, would involve the co-alignment of one of approximately 1,000 V gene segments, with one of four J-segment genes and one of 12 D-segment genes. This results in 1,000 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 12 = 48,000 possible heavy chain variable gene segments. The various segments are aligned through intrachain recombination events. Recombinational diversity for the immunoglobulin light chains is somewhat more limited, providing for approximately 1,000 different light chain variable genes. Since every functional antibody molecule is made up of two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains, the number of different combinations becomes 1,000 \u00d7 48,000 or 480,000. Added to that is the fact that the junction sites between V, J, and D segments vary, leading to junctional diversity due to single base substitutions and even short frame shifts. Finally, the mutation rate in the immunoglobulin gene cluster is approximately fivefold that of normal mutation rates. All of this is estimated to provide potential for diversity in the antibody population on the order of a billion different specificities. The T-cell receptors rearrange similarly.\n\n",

The right side of Figure 4 represents the responses of the host. These range subclinically from exposure without successful attachment or multiplication of the bacterial organism, to colonization without tissue injury, to infection that evokes a host immune response but no clinical disease. The existence of these inapparent events can be recognized only by laboratory means such as isolation of the organism or measurement of the immune response. In viral infections, the ratio of inapparent\u2013apparent (subclinical\u2013clinical) infection has been determined through prospective studies correlating the number with an antibody response to the number clinically ill. The occurrence of inapparent infections is also suggested in persons with antibody but no history of clinical disease. Some information has also come from the rate of secondary infection in families with an index case and from volunteer studies. This type of information is not available for many bacterial infections because serological techniques are not as useful and/or widely employed in measuring infection rates, but a few examples may be cited. In leptospirosis, serological tests of persons heavily exposed (veterinarians, abattoir workers) but without known illness have shown an antibody prevalence of 16%. This suggests that only 16 of 100 exposed persons have been infected as manifested by an antibody response. There are no data for leptospirosis indicating the subclinical\u2013clinical ratio, but of those clinically ill, 90% or so have an acute, self-limited illness without jaundice and with good prognosis; the overall case-fatality rate in 791 cases reported to the CDC from 1965 to 1974 was 7.7% (see Chapter 20).

Community studies of M. pneumoniae pneumonia have shown the highest incidence in school-age children, with a decline after puberty, and with the lowest rates in the over 40-year-old age group, possible reflecting immunity. However, some 25\u201350% of pneumonia in young adults, such as college students, is due to this organism, and infection rates are high in military recruits (see Chapter 24). In a long-term study of some 15,000 episodes of pneumonia in a group health plan in Seattle, about 45% were tested for M. pneumoniae by isolation and serological tests, and 15% were found to be due to this agent, with the highest rate in children.(62) A new chlamydial strain, designated as TWAR (for Taiwan acute respiratory), has been shown to be an important pathogen in acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, as well as mild upper respiratory infections.(63,64) In a retrospective examination of 200 patients from a group cooperative study,(62) 8% were due to this organism, which is a rate of 1 per 1,000 per year and with the highest incidence in the elderly. Only about 2% of patients with M. pneumoniae require hospitalization, and infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae is usually mild or asymptomatic.

Outbreaks of diarrhea in child care centers are also common, and frequent causes include rotavirus, Shigella, C. jejuni, C. difficile, G. lamblia, and Cryptosporidium. High attack rates are seen with rotavirus and some bacterial infections. Finally, some 50\u201360% of patients infected with HIV in the United States have diarrhea at the onset of illness, and initial diarrhea is seen in over 90% of AIDS patients in Africa and Haiti.(78) A wide variety of organisms may be involved, of which Cryptosporidium is the most frequent, accounting for 3\u201321% in AIDS patients in the United States and 50% in Africa and Haiti.(78) This organism may also produce diarrhea in normal persons and its contamination of a public water supply in Milwaukee resulted in a massive outbreak involving over 403,000 persons.(28)",

The following recommendations are quoted from DuPont et al.(79):In most cases a bacterial pathogen is responsible for the illness. The antimicrobial agents with the greatest activity against these organisms are cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) during the summer months in the interior of Mexico (a region where this agent has been studied extensively), and the fluoroquinolones for other places or other times, until data become available to indicate the appropriateness of cotrimoxazole here as well. Persons at risk should take along with them a drug to treat symptoms of travelers\u2019 diarrhea, and an appropriate antimicrobial agent. At the passage of the third unformed stool, it is recommended that travelers treat themselves with fluids and salt (flavored mineral water augmented with saltine crackers is sufficient in most cases), symptomatic treatment and antibacterial therapy. Of these, the antimicrobial is the most important component, which is given either as a single large dose or once or twice daily for 3 days. Perhaps optimal therapy for afebrile nondysenteric patients is loperamide in combination with the antibacterial drug. In the face of fever or dysentery, the antimicrobial should be used alone. In special situations where food and beverage restrictions cannot be followed and where the itinerary cannot tolerate even the slightest alterations because of illness, chemoprophylaxis can be considered. The most effective preventive medication in this case is the antimicrobial also used for therapy, taken in half the therapeutic dosage daily while in the area of risk. However, the majority of travelers should not use this approach.\n",

Over 80% are associated with use of urethral catheters. The spectrum of urinary infections varies and each syndrome has its own unique epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations.(83) The major risk factors include the newborn (particularly the premature), prepubertal girls, young boys, sexually active young women, elderly males, and elderly females. Risk factors that contribute to lower tract infection in women include sexual intercourse, diaphragm\u2013spermicide use, and voiding behavior.(84) UTI is the most common infectious disease of the elderly and is especially prevalent in debilitated, institutionalized older individuals. Unlike UTI in younger women, which tends to be related to frequency of sexual intercourse and is uncomplicated, in the elderly it is more difficult to treat and its pathogenesis is related to abnormal bladder function, bladder outlet obstruction, vaginal and urethral atrophy, use of long-term indwelling catheters, and puddling related to bed rest. The spectrum of organisms causing infection relates to the ecology of the patients\u2019 environments; those residing in nursing homes, and especially with permanent indwelling catheters, tend to have a greater variety of pathogenic organisms, many of which may be relatively antibiotic resistant.(85)",

They are more commonly diagnosed in men, both because men tend to have more sexual partners than do women (except prostitutes) and because the lesions are more apparent in men. Multiple infections are common in both sexes, and gonorrhea and syphilis should be excluded by appropriate examination in every patient seen with an STD. The changing nature of and the increase in these infections have several causes, including the use of measures other than the condom for contraception, changing practices in heterosexual and homosexual activities, especially involving genital\u2013oral and genital\u2013anal contact, the importation of infection from Southeast Asia, and increased public confidence in the availability and effectiveness of antibiotic therapy.",

Chlamydial genital infections include urethritis, acute epididymitis in men, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women; these are discussed in Chapter 10. Overall, about half the cases of urethritis in men are nongonococcal, and among male college students, this rises to 80\u201390%. C. trachomatis (immunotypes D\u2013K) is responsible for 30\u201350% of symptomatic cases of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and is more common in white than in black men and in higher than in lower socioeconomic levels. Its incubation period is longer than that of gonorrhea, and symptoms of urethritis in males may appear 1\u20132 weeks or longer after penicillin or spectinomycin treatment for gonorrhea, involving one third to two thirds of these men. Oral therapy of NGU with tetracycline or erythromycin hastens recovery. There is no clinical counterpart of NGU in women who develop Chlamydia infections of the cervix with or without cervicitis, but this organism may be involved in up to 30% of pelvic inflammatory diseases in females.(89) The other agents of NGU in men are uncertain, although U. urealyticum is considered the cause of 10\u201320% of NGU cases. If laboratory facilities are not available for the diagnosis of Chlamydia infections in persons with NGU, both the case and the sexual partner should be treated with appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (usually tetracycline or doxycycline) as though they had it. For detailed information on STD infections, see Chapter 9 on chancroid, Chapter 10 on Chlamydia infections, Chapter 15 on gonococcal infections, and Chapter 35 on syphilis. Viral causes are discussed in the companion book on viruses.(5)",

Some 19,027 deaths were directly attributable to a nosocomial infection and it was a contributory factor in 58,092. In reports to the CDC\u2019s National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance program in 1991\u20131992, which involves 149 hospitals, urinary tract infections were the most common site (33.1%), followed by pneumonias (15.5%), surgical site infections (14.9%), and primary bloodstream infections (13.1%), and this order was similar irrespective of the size of the hospital. Among 71,411 isolates from all sites, E. coli and S. aureus were the most common (12% each), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococcus (11%), Enterococcus spp. (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9%), Enterobacter spp. (6%), and all other organisms 5% or less.(90) Unfortunately, the major nosocomial pathogens either are naturally resistant to clinically useful antibiotics or are potentially able to develop resistance.

The specimen should be taken from the site of the infection or from the body fluid most likely to contain organisms from the infected site. The collection should be made with sterile swabs and collecting units. Cotton applicator swabs are commonly used, but since cotton may be toxic to certain bacteria, a synthetic material such as calcium alginate is preferable. An adequate sample must be obtained to prepare smears and cultures and for special isolation purposes (viruses, fungi). Swabs may be inadequate for this purpose, and the fluid itself, or a washing of it (e.g., throat, nasal, lesion), may be needed for quantitative measurement, as in urine, to determine the number of organisms present. A syringe aspirate is desirable for anaerobic cultures of purulent lesions. Since most large laboratories have special sections for bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, and treponemal diagnostic techniques, separate specimens for each microbiological group considered as a possible etiologic agent in a given infection should be collected. Special techniques may be needed to avoid contamination by normal flora in needle or surgical aspirations from a lesion or from a transtracheal or transurethral site.",

For example, the etiology of some 85% of acute purulent meningitis cases and of many bacterial pneumonias can be identified by smear, especially if capsular swelling occurs in the presence of specific antisera. Simple microscopic examination of an unstained, uncentrifuged specimen of urine that shows bacteria indicates a quantitative bacterial count of 104\u2013105/ml, and the morphology may point to the proper etiology. The examination of bacteria in fresh preparations or on culture, after staining with specific, immunofluorescent-labeled antisera, provides specific diagnosis of group A hemolytic streptococci, plague bacillus, and E. coli; it has also been useful in identifying the organism in acute meningitis, in cervical gonorrhea, and in primary syphilis.",

Commercial kits are becoming rapidly available for many of these techniques.(94) A number of molecular techniques are now being used for both phenotypic and genotypic identification of organisms and are well reviewed in a recent article.(95) Those used for epidemiological studies of phenotypic variants include antibiotic resistance patterns (antibiograms), biotyping, bacteriocin production, serotyping, outer membrane protein analysis, phage typing, immunoblotting, and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. The limitations of these techniques are that they do not take genetic exchange or mutations into account, are nonspecific, and are not widely applicable. Independent isolates of the same strain may vary in their phenotype. Genotypic typing methods are used to identify the genetic composition of the organism by study of chromosomal, plasmid, or transposon DNA. The techniques include plasmid profile analysis, restriction endonuclease analysis, ribotyping, pulsed field electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction digests, arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reactions, and nucleotide sequence analysis. Variations in the reproducibility and discriminatory power of the two general methods differ; in general, those that involve genotypic methods are better. Their application permits identification of specific patterns of transmission of an organism, differentiation between reinfection and reactivation, and recognition of the geographic distribution of a particular strain. The epidemiology of antibiotic resistance involves (1) R plasmid spread (inter- and intraspecies), (2) strain (clonal) dissemination, and (3) transposition of R genes into R plasmids or chromosomes. These many techniques now provide the epidemiologist the means for the rapid identification of many organisms, including the specific strain involved, so that transmission patterns can be followed. Of special interest are the so-called emerging infections, which in the United States include E. coli O157:H7 disease, cryptosporidiosis, coccidioidomycosis, multidrug-resistant pneumococcal disease, vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections, and Hantavirus infections. Special surveillance and diagnostic centers have been established to monitor these infections.(96)",

In syphilis, a great variety of serological tests have been used, employing both nontreponemal and treponemal antigens. The VDRL test is most widely employed as an initial test and is highly sensitive and well standardized but lacks high specificity.

Yaws (T. pertenue) shares identical reactivities with T. pallidum and cannot be differentiated serologically. Typhoid fever results in increases to the H, O, and other antigens of the organism; an increase in O-antigen titer in the absence of recent immunization is indicative of recent infection.

While fulfillment of these postulates provides strong evidence of a causal association, the failure to fulfill them does not exclude this relationship. Even at the time of presentation in 1890, Koch himself recognized some of these limitations, especially the inability to reproduce some diseases in experimental animals. At that time, this was true of cholera, typhoid fever, diphtheria, leprosy, and relapsing fever, for which Koch felt it necessary to fulfill only the first two postulates. Since then, many other limitations have been recognized,(102) as our knowledge of microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis has increased. These include recognition of the asymptomatic carrier state, which would invalidate the second postulate if an individual were carrier of organism A and his disease was caused by organism B. The concepts of multiple causation, of inapparent infection, and of the biological gradient of disease are also limitations. The postulates are not generally applicable to viral and parasitic diseases or for organisms that cannot be grown in culture or induce an immune response. Criteria are also needed for chronic diseases. In an effort to cover these various possibilities, a \u201cunified\u201d set of postulates based mainly on epidemiological criteria have been proposed.(103) It is clear that all postulates and guidelines of causation are limited by the technology available to prove them and by our knowledge of disease mechanisms at the time. The need for establishing guidelines for causation is ever present in the field of bacteriology, where the causal relationship between parasite and disease must be established for newly recognized diseases such as Lyme disease, Legionnaires\u2019 disease, Pittsburgh pneumonia, chlamydial pneumonia and urethritis, infant botulism, enterotoxic E. coli diarrhea, H. pylori and gastric ulcer and carcinoma, toxic shock syndrome, and streptococcal B infections in infancy. New causes for old diseases, new diseases from old causes, and new diseases with new causes keep appearing as our techniques for their isolation and identification improve.\n\n",

Bacteriological and chemical standards for the purity of water have been established and are reinforced by governmental and legal regulations. The presence of E. coli in defined numbers per milliliter2 is taken as an index of fecal contamination of water. However, its absence does not guarantee water safety, since organisms such as hepatitis A and E viruses may escape filtration and chlorination procedures, and more recently Cryptosporidium cysts escaped a filtration system in a public water supply in Milwaukee, causing a massive outbreak of diarrhea involving over 403,000 persons.(28) This organism is also resistant to tolerable levels of chlorine. For the traveler, treatment of water with chlorine-release tablets or a drop of Lugal\u2019s iodine solution per quart of water 30 min prior to use or by boiling for 5 min (portable heating units can be purchased) will decrease the likelihood of acquiring bacterial intestinal infections in developing countries. Small millipore filter kits are also available for the traveler and are said to remove bacteria, G. lamblia, and even some viruses. Should these methods not be available, one can allow the water to run until very hot, collect it, and then use it for drinking water.

In the summer months, 75% of many fruits and vegetables are harvested outside the country and delivered within days to grocery stores and restaurants in the United States.(105) Salad bars, now present in most restaurants, provide fruits and vegetables that may have originated in Mexico, Central America, or tropical or semitropical climes and are a major source of food poisoning.(106) The fast-food chain, particularly those serving undercooked hamburgers, have been the source of food outbreaks, particularly due to E. coli O157:H7 infection in the United States(107); this organism has also led to an epidemic in a child care center. Foodborne outbreaks have also been due to shigellosis on a commercial airline,(108) and to Salmonella in a multistate outbreak due in contaminated cheese.(109) These developments have led to a changing epidemiology of foodborne disease and to new approaches to prevention.(110,111) Human handling during preparation may result in contamination by many bacteria, especially staphylococci, Salmonella, and Shigella. Thorough cooking immediately prior to eating will reduce the hazard of infection but may fail to inactivate preformed heat-stable toxins such as C. perfringens. Proper refrigeration or freezing of food has been as important as water and sewage management in the reduction of intestinal diseases. It prevents the multiplication of most bacteria, and freezing often destroys some parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella spiralis.

With this in mind, the CDC has issued recommendations for the prevention of transmission of HIV, hepatitis B, and other blood-borne pathogens in medical care settings.(115) These standard precautions are to be applied to all patients, including those coming into emergency rooms, where there is often risk of such exposures and the status of the patients is usually unknown.

Standard precautions specifically involve the use of gloves whenever contact with blood or other such body fluids is anticipated and other barrier techniques (masks, gowns, and protective eyewear) whenever splashes of such fluids are expected. This would apply to the use of gloves when touching blood and body fluids, mucous membranes, or soiled articles or surfaces, and when doing venipunctures or inserting intravenous lines, and to the use of masks in operative or invasive procedures.

The vaccine is particularly recommended for three groups: (1) adults with chronic diseases, especially of the cardiovascular or pulmonary systems; (2) adults with chronic illnesses specifically associated with an increased risk of pneumococcal infection or its complications (splenic dysfunction, Hodgkin\u2019s disease, multiple myeloma, cirrhosis, alcoholism, renal failure, CSF leaks, and in immunosuppressed patients); and (3) older adults, especially those 65 years of age and over, regardless of whether they are healthy or diseased.

Mild side reactions consisting of erythema and pain at the site of injection occur in about half the recipients. Medicare helps pay the cost in these designated groups.

In 1994, the WHO declared this disease to be a public health emergency,(128) and it is believed to be \u201cout of control\u201d in many parts of the world. The WHO identified 10 industrial countries in which cases of tuberculosis increased 5\u201333% in recent years. In the United States, an estimated 15 million persons are believed to be infected. The increase of infection in HIV-infected persons with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains in this group and in others who were inadequately treated is of special concern. Such resistant strains spread readily to others. About 4.5% of tuberculosis in the United States was associated with HIV infection, and a rise to 13.8% is anticipated by the year 2000. As Comstock(129) has pointed out, the patterns of change and reasons for it are multiple and complex both in the United States and other areas of the world. While HIV is widely blamed, there are many other factors such as migration, poverty, malnutrition, and decreased tuberculosis control efforts, and it is difficult to assess the relative importance of each in the trends observed. In 1991, 56% of active cases were reported among Hispanics and African Americans. The only vaccine available is BCG, and contradictory evidence exists as to its efficacy. An excellent brief review has recently summarized the evidence.(130) More people have received BCG vaccine than any other vaccine, yet its efficacy remains in doubt. It is a part of the routine WHO EPI program. For example, the WHO estimates that 85% of all children born in 1990 received BCG vaccine in their first year of life. Estimates of its efficacy range from 0 to 80% in different settings. Such great variation has been attributed to different vaccine strains, methodological differences, variation in the infecting organism in different countries, the genetic background of the exposed groups, and environmental interactions with other mycobacterial strains in the population. Indeed, a higher efficacy has been seen against leprosy than tuberculosis in some studies. One recent meta-analysis involving 14 trials and 12 observational studies concluded that BCG reduced the risk of tuberculosis by 50%,(131) despite great heterogeneity in the data. In another meta-analysis of results showing homogeneity, BCG was 86% effective against miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis; the preventive effect against pulmonary tuberculosis showed such heterogeneity that they did not calculate a summary measure.(132) It seems reasonable to believe that BCG is effective against the spread of tuberculosis within the body, such as miliary spread and spread to the meninges, but that its protection against infection varies greatly in different settings and with different vaccines. Comstock(129) has discussed the use of BCG and the CDC has outlined its use in control in a joint statement with the ACIP and the Advisory Committee on the Control of Tuberculosis.(133) General problems in the production standards for BCG and the need for recombinant technology in the development of a vaccine whose mechanism of action and efficacy can be better understood and evaluated have been recently presented.(134\u2013136) BCG use is not routinely recommended in the United States because of the generally low incidence of disease and because BCG interferes with the interpretation of the tuberculin skin test. These recommendations may have to be modified for high-risk groups, in view of recent increases in incidence and resistant organisms. (See also Chapter 39.)",

It has been employed in persons at high risk after known exposure in epidemics (meningococcus), in household contacts of cases (e.g., streptococcus, meningococcus, tuberculosis), and in sexual partners (gonococcus, syphilis), one of whom is infected. It has been employed after infection is diagnosed to prevent further spread or to limit complications (tuberculosis, rheumatic fever) or to limit the duration of the carrier state. The major limitations have been the development of antibiotic resistance, multiple organisms causing the disease, and poor patient compliance for long-term prophylaxis. Any mass prophylactic program aimed at a large group, especially a closed population, over a long term sets the stage for the development of resistance in the organism of interest as well as other circulating organisms. Antibiotic prophylaxis has met with debatable success when the bacterial sensitivity is not high, if the antibiotic is inhibitory but not bactericidal, if multiple organisms are involved (especially gram-negative), and if the risk of infection is relatively low, as in clean surgical operations.

The most successful are the prevention of recurrent streptococcal infections in persons with rheumatic heart disease and the prevention of disease in persons with infections due to M. tuberculosis, especially recent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis with sulfadiazine for sulfa-sensitive organisms or rifampin for sulfa-resistant organisms is advocated for family or close contacts of patients with meningococcal meningitis or outbreaks in closed settings. These principles apply in large community outbreaks when sulfadiazine is given on a mass basis for sulfonamide-sensitive meningococci; of resistant strains in this situation, rifampin is not recommended because of the possibility of developing resistance to this drug.(17) \u201cEpidemiological treatment\u201d after known sexual exposure to gonorrhea or syphilis is effective, but requires a full therapeutic regimen. Prevention of infection during and after surgery is advocated in surgical procedures at high risk to infection such as total hip and knee replacement, colon\u2013rectal surgery, and transurethral resection of the prostate.(139) Patients whose immune status is compromised by steroids, irradiation, alkylating and antimetabolic agents, and other immunosuppressive drugs are at high risk to certain bacterial, fungal, and viral organisms, including some that are not normally pathogenic, but no antimicrobial prophylaxis has been effective. They may be placed in protective isolation (see Section 14.2.1) and closely watched and antibiotic therapy instituted if infection occurs. A possible exception to the ineffectiveness of antibiotics in preventing infections is the prophylactic use of isoniazid in immunosuppressed patients with inactive tuberculosis. Antibiotics or other prophylactic measures for prevention of traveler\u2019s diarrhea are recommended only for the long-term traveler in high-risk endemic areas(80,106); for short-term visitors, bismuth subsalicylate has proved useful.(43)\n",

Some combination vaccines are available and may be used whenever administration of all components of the vaccine is indicated. Providers should consult the manufactures\u2019 package inserts for detailed recommendations. Vaccines are listed under the routinely recommended ages. Bars indicate range of acceptable ages for vaccination. Shaded bars indicate catch-up vaccination: at 11\u201312 years, hepatitis B vaccine should be administered to children not previously vaccinated, and varicella virus vaccine should be administered to unvaccinated children who lack a reliable history of chickenpox. Use of trade names and commerical sources is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by the Public Health Service or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Source: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). \nb\nInfants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative mothers should receive 2.5 \u03bcg of Merck vaccine (Recombivax HB\u00ae) or 10 \u03bcg of SmithKline Beecham (SB) vaccine (Energix-B\u00ae). The second dose should be administered >1 month after the first dose. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive 0.5 ml hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 h of birth and either 5 \u03bcg of Merck vaccine (Recombivax HB\u00ae) or 10 \u03bcg of SB vaccine (Engerix-B\u00ae) at a separate site. The second dose is recommended at age 1\u20132 months and the third dose at age 6 months. Infants born to mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown should receive either 5 \u03bcg of Merck vaccine (Recombivax HB\u00ae) or 10 \u03bcg of SB vaccine (Engerix-B\u00ae) within 12 h of birth. The second dose of vaccine is recommended at age 1 month and the third dose at age 6 months. Blood should be drawn at the time of delivery to determine the mother\u2019s HBsAg status; if it is positive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible (no later than age 1 week). The dosage and timing of subsequent vaccine doses should be based on the mother\u2019s HBsAg status. \ncChildren and adolescents who have not been vaccinated against hepatitis B during infancy may begin the series during any childhood visit. Those who have not previously received three doses of hepatitis B vaccine should initiate or complete the series at age 11\u201312 years. The second dose should be administered at least 1 month after the first dose, and the third dose should be administered at least 4 months after the first dose and at least 2 months after the second dose. \ndDiphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is the preferred vaccine for all doses in the vaccination series, including completion of the series in children who have received one or more doses of whole-cell diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP). Whole-cell DPT is an acceptable alternative to DTaP. The fourth dose of DTaP may be administered as early as 12 months of age, provided 6 months have elapsed since the third dose and if the child is considered unlikely to return at age 15\u201318 months. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td), absorbed, for adult use, are recommended at age 11\u201312 years if at least 5 years have elapsed since the last dose of DTP, DTaP, or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Subsequent routine Td boosters are recommended every 10 years. \neThree H. influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines are licensed for infant use. If PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB\u00ae [Merck]) is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required. After completing the primary series, any Hib conjugate vaccine may be used as a booster. \nfTwo poliovirus vaccines are currently licensed in the United States: inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). The following schedules are all acceptable by ACIP, AAP, and AAFP, and parents and providers may choose among them: (1) IPV at ages 2 and 4 months and OPV at age 12\u201318 months and at age 4\u20136 years; (2) IPV at ages 2, 4, and 12\u201318 months and at age 4\u20136 years; and (3) OPV at ages 2, 4, and 6\u201318 months and at age 4\u20136 years. ACIP routinely recommends schedule 1. IPV is the only poliovirus vaccine recommended for immunocompromised persons and their household contacts. \ngThe second dose of measles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella vaccine is routinely recommended at age 4\u20136 years or at age 11\u201312 years but may be administered during any visit, provided at least 1 month has elapsed since receipt of the first dose and that both doses are administered at or after age 12 months. \nhSusceptible children may receive varicella vaccine (Var) during any visit after the first birthday, and unvaccinated persons who lack a reliable history of chickenpox should be vaccinated at11\u201312 years. Susceptible persons aged\u226513 years should receive two doses at least 1 month apart.",
