As a result, even close and long-lived contacts between membranes under physiological conditions do not yield fusion (reviewed in Chernomordik et al., 2006). Thus, membrane fusion is widely assumed to be controlled by, and to rely on, the activity of fusogenic proteins that lower the energy barrier of the process and drive membrane bilayer rearrangements that result in membrane and cell merging (Chernomordik et al., 2006, Jahn et al., 2003). Theoretically, any of the biological fusion reactions for which no specialized fusogen has been identified may represent a hypothetical \u201cspontaneous\u201d fusion (Kerbel et al., 1983) dependent on destabilization of membrane bilayers caused by changes in their composition, and by proteins that normally carry out fusion-unrelated functions (Byrne et al., 2007, Lemaire et al., 2006, Palovuori and Eskelinen, 2000). However, all well-characterized biological fusion events studied so far have been found to rely on the activity of specialized fusogens that directly fuse lipid bilayers (Chernomordik et al., 2006, Jahn et al., 2003).",

In contrast, validation of a candidate eukaryotic cellular protein as a \u201ctrue\u201d developmental fusogen in vivo is not a trivial task. Many candidate proteins have been proposed to act as developmental fusogens, yet only a fraction of these proteins have proven to be actual fusogens (reviewed in Oren-Suissa and Podbilewicz, 2007). A bona fide fusogen has to satisfy several criteria, such as being necessary for cell fusion and localizing to the fusion site. Final validation stems from fusogen sufficiency to directly mediate fusion in heterologous cells or liposomes. Verifying these standards for a candidate fusion protein is a major challenge in identifying the missing developmental fusogens, which is a crucial step in deciphering the molecular basis of cell fusion during development (Oren-Suissa and Podbilewicz, 2007).",

Emerging mechanisms of viral fusion will be the basis of comparison with the less-characterized and likely more complex process of cell fusion in eukaryotes. We will focus on the proteins that drive membrane rearrangements in the transition from membrane tethering to opening and expansion of fusion pores, a process that lies at the heart of cell fusion (\nFigure 1). To avoid mechanistic misinterpretations derived from emphasis on candidate fusogens that might not participate in the membrane fusion process per se, we will restrict our review to the selected group of fusogens that have been shown to directly fuse heterologous cells (Figure 1). We will discuss both similarities and differences in the structures and activities of the different fusogens, emphasizing the constraints and flexibility of the molecular mechanisms leading to cell fusion.",

One working model for the merging of biological membranes involves four simple steps: (1) Two opposed biological membranes are separated by 10\u201320 nm. (2) The membranes undergo deformations, causing a local approach. (3) The reaction proceeds via a stereotypic membrane lipid rearrangement, called hemifusion. In this step the outer leaflets, which face each other through an intermembrane 3\u20135 nm water gap, are the first to fuse, and proceed to mix their lipids. In contrast, the inner leaflets remain separated, preventing the mixing of aqueous contents (Chernomordik et al., 2006). (4) Subsequent merger of the inner leaflets marks the transition from a hemifusion intermediate to a fusion pore and contents mixing (Figure 1). Current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which proteins fuse membranes is, to a large extent, based on the work on viral fusion.",

            "text": "Most viral fusogens are organized as homo- or hetero-oligomeric complexes comprising one (e.g., influenza; Earp et al., 2005, White, 1992) or up to four (e.g., herpes simplex; Subramanian and Geraghty, 2007) types of transmembrane envelope glycoproteins. Premature activation of the fusogen and incorrect fusion are suppressed either by the position of the fusogenic domains that are buried inside the protein, or by inhibitory interactions with peripheral subunits or accessory proteins. At the onset of fusion, these interactions are released to allow conformational changes of the proteins toward their fusogenic forms. Fusogen activation can be triggered by virus interaction with cell-surface receptors at neutral pH (e.g., HIV), or by virus internalization and exposure to mildly acidic pH along the endocytic pathway (e.g., influenza virus) (Earp et al., 2005). Alternatively, activation can occur via sequential receptor interactions and acidification, as in avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (Mothes et al., 2000). In the case of Ebola virus (Chandran et al., 2005) and SARS-coronavirus (Simmons et al., 2005), receptor binding induces conformational changes that allow cathepsin-mediated proteolysis within acidic endosomes, releasing fusogenic polypeptide fragments. In conclusion, the timing and location of virus-cell fusion is controlled by diverse mechanisms of fusogen activation that prevent premature nonproductive launching of the fusion machinery.",

Each class I protein is initially synthesized as an immature precursor that is proteolitically processed into two polypeptides. Ectodomains of at least some of these fusogens (e.g., influenza A hemagglutinin [HA] and HIV ENV) are organized in homotrimers that are probably oriented perpendicularly to the envelope surface. Fusion appears to require the concerted action of several HA trimers (Danieli et al., 1996, Kanaseki et al., 1997, Markovic et al., 2001, Yang et al., 2005). In contrast, fusion of HIV might require just a single ENV trimer (Yang et al., 2005). In the initial prefusion state, each trimer contains conserved fusion peptides, which are buried inside the trimeric complex. Activation induces a conformational change resulting in the formation of extended \u03b1-helical coiled-coil domains that are thought to insert the fusion peptides into the opposing membrane. In the final postfusion conformation, a six-helix bundle forms a hairpin structure that results in the colocalization of the transmembrane domains and fusion peptides at the same fused membrane (Figure 1A).",

These proteins harbor both \u03b1 helices, which presumably form a six-helix bundle to fold back the protein as with class I viral fusogens, and an elongated \u03b2 sheet structure with an amphiphilic fusion peptide at its end, reminiscent of class II viral fusogens. In contrast to class I and II proteins, this fusion peptide is very short\u2014just a few hydrophobic amino acid residues\u2014and is discontinuous. For example, in the prefusion conformation of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) envelope protein G, a bipartite fusion domain is exposed rather than hidden at an oligomeric interface. In both prefusion and postfusion conformations, the membrane-interacting fusion domains and transmembrane domains are located at the same end of the homotrimeric fusogen (Figure 1C). As with class I and II fusogens, class III proteins form complexes made of several fusogenic proteins that may have cooperative functions during membrane fusion (Gaudin et al., 1996, Roche et al., 2007).",

These fusogens, referred to as fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins, have just 40 amino acid residues in the ectodomain, which includes a short and mildly hydrophobic domain (Cheng et al., 2005, Shmulevitz et al., 2004, Shmulevitz and Duncan, 2000). FAST proteins are much smaller than the \u201cclassical\u201d fusogens of enveloped viruses, which are 150 to 300 amino acid residues long; they lack any extended heptad repeat structures; and they do not appear to undergo major conformational changes under the conditions of fusion.

            "text": "Even for the best-characterized viral fusogens, the specific mechanisms of action are yet to be identified. The convergence of many viral fusogens with structurally diverse prefusion conformations to a similar hairpin postfusion conformation is believed to underlie a conserved principle of action (Kielian and Rey, 2006, Weissenhorn et al., 2007). According to several proposed mechanisms, refolding of the fusogen into the final hairpin structure exerts a pulling force that bends membranes and, thus, primes them for fusion (Bentz, 2000, Kozlov and Chernomordik, 1998, Weissenhorn et al., 1997). However, some findings seem to disagree with these models. (1) Formation of a hairpin structure for class I fusogens can be separated from fusion since the former either precedes (Borrego-Diaz et al., 2003, Park et al., 2003) or follows (Markosyan et al., 2003, Markosyan et al., 2004) membrane merger. (2) FAST proteins are unlikely to establish rigid hairpin structures and also appear to be too short (\u223c1.5 nm) to reach the target membrane through the 10\u201320 nm gap between contacting membranes (Shmulevitz and Duncan, 2000). (3) The pulling force that fusogens can apply to the membranes is limited by the tightness of their membrane anchoring by fusion peptides. If binding of the peptides to the membrane is weak, as in the case of short and/or not very hydrophobic peptides, the force would detach the anchors from the membrane before the membrane bends. From this perspective, pulling membranes together by VSV G likely requires a concerted action of multiple trimers because the very short fusion peptide loops of this protein (Roche et al., 2006) restrict the force that might be delivered by each trimer.",

It has been hypothesized that these later stages in fusion might be driven by lateral membrane tension generated by the assembly of multiple fusogenic molecules into a relatively rigid interconnected protein coat around the fusion site (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003, Kozlov and Chernomordik, 2002, Leikina et al., 2004). The finding that fusion proteins located outside the direct contact zone might be involved in driving fusion pore expansion (Leikina et al., 2004, Lenz et al., 2005) substantiates the hypothesis that this fusion stage is driven by long-range membrane stresses.",

First, viral fusogens anchor the viral and host membranes, and then fold back into hairpins to reduce the distance between the two bilayers. Second, the fusion peptides or loops and transmembrane domains of diverse fusogens interact with the membranes to initiate fusion. Diverse viral fusogens including influenza virus HA (class I) (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003), Sindbis virus E1 glycoprotein (class II) (Zaitseva et al., 2005), Rabies G protein (class III) (Gaudin, 2000), and FAST proteins (Top et al., 2005) are reported to catalyze fusion pore opening through the hemifusion pathway. Third, lateral interactions between adjacent fusogens drive pore expansion (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003). Because this pathway is controlled by the elastic properties of membrane bilayers, many models converge on the hypothesis that fusogens act by shaping the membranes and generating elastic stresses that are released by hemifusion and fusion (Kozlov and Chernomordik, 1998, Kuzmin et al., 2001, Martens et al., 2007, Zimmerberg et al., 2006).",

These single transmembrane proteins harbor all the domains characteristic of class I viral fusogens, including a potential amphiphilic fusion peptide, and undergo maturation steps that are reminiscent of HIV ENV (Blond et al., 1999, Cheynet et al., 2005). Sequence analysis and partial structural data of Syncytin-1 and -2 have revealed that they share structural domains with several class I viral fusogens, strengthening the notion that these proteins originated from these fusogens and may use similar mechanisms to promote fusion (Renard et al., 2005) (Figure 1A). However, it is not known whether the fusogenic activity of Syncytins relies on dynamic conformational changes of these fusogens that are similar to the proposed fusion mechanisms of class I viral fusogens. Furthermore, the potential membrane remodeling effects of Syncytins leading to the hemifusion membrane intermediate, pore formation, and complete fusion have not yet been determined. As with fusion mediated by their viral fusogen ancestors, fusion mediated by Syncytin-1 and -2 is dependent on the binding of these proteins to cell surface receptors. Syncytin-1 binds the ASCT1 and ASCT2 receptors (Blond et al., 2000, Marin et al., 2003), whereas the receptors of Syncytin-2 remain uncharacterized (Blaise et al., 2003). An additional layer of regulation of the fusogenic activities of these proteins is provided by their placental expression. Syncytin-2 expression is restricted to the cytotrophoblasts (Malassine et al., 2007), whereas Syncytin-1 is predominantly expressed in the cytotrophoblasts and syncytial trophoblasts (Blond et al., 2000, Frendo et al., 2003, Mi et al., 2000). Hence, placental activity of Syncytins emerged, presumably, due to the organism's transcriptional networks that control Syncytins' expression. In contrast, viral tissue specificity is regulated posttranscriptionally, and is determined primarily by the distribution of appropriate receptors on target cells, and by fusogen activation.",

In rodents, Syncytins appear to be limited to the Muridae family, including the mouse, the gerbil, and the hamster (Dupressoir et al., 2005). Hence, Syncytin integration occurred after the speciation of Muridae from other rodent families some 20 million years ago (MYA). Similarly, the primate-specific distribution of Syncytin-1 and -2 suggest that they integrated specifically into the genome of the primate ancestor 20\u201340 MYA. Lack of Syncytins in the genomes of other mammals demonstrates that the existence of these elements is not rooted in early stages of mammalian evolution, but rather that Syncytin integration occurred independently after the speciation of rodents and primates during later mammalian evolution.",

In contrast the placentas of other rodents are simpler, comprised of one cellular and one syncytiotrophoblast layer (monochorial placenta) that require less fusion events. Similarly, placentas of primates seem to be more complex than those of related nonprimate mammals. This raises the possibility that formation of the complex placentas of primates and these rodents necessitates fast and efficient fusion. This may occur by the preferential adoption of proficient viral-derived ENV fusogens instead of other unidentified, possibly slower, endogenous placental fusogens that act in other organisms. Although expression of Syncytins and other cellular env genes from additional HERV elements is not restricted to cells of the placenta (de Parseval and Heidmann, 2005, Mi et al., 2000), the activities of these genes cannot account for all fusion events in mammals. It appears that cellular env genes are not expressed in muscles and bones, where massive fusion events occur, suggesting that these fusions rely on the activity of as yet unidentified fusogens. Thus, nonplacental fusogens probably fuse cells via different mechanisms, suggesting that even within a single organism the mechanisms underlying cell fusion are diverse.",

Experiments in insect cell culture have demonstrated fusogenic activity for the transmembrane isoforms of FF proteins, whereas the function of the secreted forms remains uncharacterized (Podbilewicz et al., 2006, Sapir et al., 2007). Like most viral fusogens, the transmembrane forms of FF proteins possess an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a long extracellular portion, a predicted transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular tail. Sequence comparison of putative FF orthologs in several nematode species has uncovered novel motifs that do not exist in viral fusogens and might be critical for FF-mediated fusion. A striking conservation in the position and number of all 16 cysteines in the extracellular portion of FF proteins from 17 different nematode species suggests that these proteins are folded in a similar 3D structure that is essential for their fusogenic activity (\nFigure 2; O.A. and B.P., unpublished data). Despite this conservation in nematodes, there is only minor sequence similarity of FFs to proteins from organisms outside the nematode phylum (Sapir et al., 2007). Most prominent is the spacing and position of nine extracellular cysteines defining a domain that exhibits similarity to the TGF-\u03b2 binding domain of the activin/BMP/TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor superfamily (Kirsch et al., 2000). Because this domain in FF proteins lacks critical residues that are essential for the binding of TGF-\u03b2 ligands, it is unlikely that FF proteins function as TGF-\u03b2 receptors (Sapir et al., 2007). This domain may emerge, however, as an interacting extracellular region conserved between nematode FF proteins and the unidentified fusogens in other phyla (Podbilewicz et al., 2006, Sapir et al., 2007).",

Experiments in vivo and in heterologous culture cells indicate that expression of EFF-1 in only one of two bound cells is insufficient for fusion (Podbilewicz et al., 2006), and similar observations were made in vivo for AFF-1 (Sapir et al., 2007). The requirement for the same fusogen to be present on both fusing membranes thus defines a homotypic arrangement as a cornerstone of the FF fusion mechanism, distinguishing it from the single-membrane localization of viral and Syncytin fusogens (Figure 1; White, 2007). This homotypic machinery of FF mediated fusion is somewhat reminiscent of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-dependent intracellular membrane fusion, which involves interactions among three different t-SNARE proteins localized to the surface of the target membrane and one v-SNARE protein on the opposing vesicle membrane (Bonifacino and Glick, 2004, Cai et al., 2007, Jahn et al., 2003, Jahn and Scheller, 2006). SNAREs contain domains consisting of a single \u03b1-helical amphipathic bundle that is unstructured in the nonassembled state (Figure 1D). SNARE interactions yield a hydrophobic helical core complex that is proposed to \u201czipper\u201d the SNARE motifs from their N-terminal ends toward their C-terminal membrane anchors and, as a result, to clamp the membranes together (Jahn and Scheller, 2006). In addition to their vesicle fusion activity, SNARE proteins have the potential to fuse the plasma membranes of neighboring cells, as elegantly demonstrated in a system in which artificially engineered \u201cflipped\u201d SNAREs on the cell surface mediate hemifusion and complete cell-cell fusion (Giraudo et al., 2005, Hu et al., 2003).",

Furthermore, there is no obvious long \u03b1-helical coiled-coil domain in the ectodomain region of the FF fusogens. It is possible that FF-mediated fusion occurs via a zippering mechanism like that proposed for SNAREs that leads to membrane conjunction and fusion (Figure 1E). However, this zippering possibly relies on the folding of cysteine-based structures in the extracellular domain of FF proteins and not on SNARE-like \u03b1-helical coiled-coil bundling. The novel homotypic arrangement of the fusogens identified for FF proteins may stem from the need for tight control on the execution of developmental fusion events. For example, homotypic design can prevent unregulated fusion at the edges of a multinucleate cell, allowing better control of syncytium size and shape (Podbilewicz et al., 2006). This mechanistic aspect may serve as a general theme in developmental cell fusion in multicellular organisms.",

However, EFF-1 appears to control the entire pathway. As mentioned above, EFF-1 induces membrane rearrangement, leading to a hemifusion intermediate. EFF-1 also opens initial fusion pores, as evidenced by lack of cytoplasmic content mixing and pore formation in loss-of-function eff-1 mutants. Finally, partial activity of EFF-1 in temperature-sensitive mutant animals resulted in formation of partially expanding pores of 50\u2013100 nm that fail to further expand (Gattegno et al., 2007, Shemer et al., 2004). Thus, EFF-1 is required first to induce membrane hemifusion at sites that are subsequently rearranged into membrane pores, and second to expand these pores to fully disassemble the contact junction to yield a syncytium (Gattegno et al., 2007, Podbilewicz et al., 2006). The requirement of many more viral glycoproteins for expansion of initial fusion pores (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003) raises the possibility that additional proteins are acting with EFF-1 to expand fusion pores. Recently, the role of the actin-remodeling molecules WASP and WIP in D. melanogaster muscle fusion pore expansion has been proposed (Massarwa et al., 2007) in parallel with a distinct role of these molecules in prefusion vesicle exocytosis (Kim et al., 2007). It is not known whether pore expansion in C. elegans relies solely on EFF-1 activity or requires additional proteins (for example, the C. elegans WIP and WASP orthologs).",

Transcription factors from different families (e.g., homeobox, GATA, Zn fingers, FOS-1) positively and negatively control FF protein expression and hence FF-mediated fusion (Cassata et al., 2005, Margalit et al., 2007, Sapir et al., 2007, Shemer and Podbilewicz, 2002, Alper and Kenyon, 2001, Alper and Kenyon, 2002, Koh et al., 2002, Koh and Rothman, 2001, Podbilewicz, 2006). In addition to transcriptional control, posttranslational regulation of FF proteins is suggested by their dynamic localization in the fusing cells. In an elegant study, del Campo et al. (2005) showed that EFF-1 is specifically and dynamically enriched at the contact zone between two fusing cells in vivo. In addition, possible posttranslational modulators of FF fusion have been identified: fus-1, which encodes a subunit of the Vacuolar-ATPase complex that was proposed to function as a proton pump, represses EFF-1-mediated fusion (Kontani et al., 2005). nsf-1, which encodes the NEM-sensitive factor (NSF) that presumably functions in vesicle trafficking, may promote AFF-1-mediated fusion of the AC (Choi et al., 2006). This possible connection between FUS-1 and NSF-1 proteins and FFs was not further elucidated. Currently, there is no indication that FF-mediated fusion is regulated by conformational changes of these proteins like the trigger-dependent restructuring of viral fusogens. Although this mode of regulation might exist, it seems that transcriptional control combined with dynamic subcellular localization of the proteins might be a central mechanism to regulate and specify FF-mediated cell fusion within the organism.",

Second, fusion triggering involves processing, receptor binding, exposure to low pH, or some combination thereof. Third, triggering elicits diverse conformational changes involving coiled-coils and/or \u03b2 sheets exposing and inserting amphiphilic fusion domains into the opposing membrane. Fourth, diverse viral fusogens establish remarkably similar hairpin rod-like structures. Fifth, hairpin formation, interactions between the fusion domains and membranes, and, likely, lateral protein-protein interactions drive membrane rearrangements into a hemifusion intermediate followed by fusion pore formation and expansion.",

Deciphering the evolution of the fusion mechanism employed by Syncytins, and their role in vivo, are two intriguing topics for future research.

(A) Class I viral fusogens (such as in HIV) contain two \u03b1 helices and an amphiphilic fusion peptide buried inside the protein in the prefusion state. Upon activation, the trimers undergo a conformational change leading to the formation of rigid coiled-coil structures with exposed fusion peptides at their N termini. Insertion of fusion peptides into the host membrane, concomitant with protein fold back into six-helix bundles, leads to membrane tightening, hemifusion, and pore formation (Kielian and Rey, 2006). (B) In Class II viral fusogens (for example, in Dengue viruses), hydrophobic fusion loops emanate from a structure containing \u03b2 sheets. After fusogen activation and a shift from heterodimers to homotrimers (not shown), the fusion loops are exposed and inserted into the opposing membrane. Folding back occurs presumably by interaction between different domains of the protein that drive membrane fusion (Kielian and Rey, 2006). (C) Class III fusogens (such as in Rabies and VSV viruses) combine characteristics of Class I and II including short and discontinuous hydrophobic fusion loops that stem from a structure containing \u03b2 sheets, and \u03b1 helices that potentially form six-helix bundles to merge the membranes together. In contrast to class I and II fusogens, activation does not require fusion domain exposure (Heldwein et al., 2006, Weissenhorn et al., 2007). (D) SNARE-dependent intracellular fusion. Three different t-SNAREs, each with a single \u03b1 helix domain, are bundled to form the target complex. This complex binds a single \u03b1 helix of v-SNARE that emanates from the vesicle membrane. Transition between loose and tight t- SNARE-v-SNARE complexes is mediated by SNARE zippering and tethering of the membranes, leading to their fusion (Jahn and Scheller, 2006). (E) Hypothetical model of FF fusion. The extracellular domains of FF proteins (C. elegans EFF-1 and AFF-1 proteins) are comprised of juxta-membrane hypothetical globular domains (brown ellipses) and a putative cysteine-rich conserved domain that presumably forms an S-S based structure (in blue). Part of these predicted extracellular loops are reminiscent of TGF-\u03b2 receptor-like domains (in red). We hypothesize that cis-dimerization of FF molecules is followed by homotypic trans-binding between dimmers. Trans-zippering of FF complexes from the two membranes induces membrane tightening, hemifusion, and fusion pore formation.",

We aligned Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce) FF proteins with putative homologs from Pristionchus pacificus (Ppa), estimated to diverge 200 million years ago (MYA) (Gutierrez and Sommer, 2004), and with proteins from the remotest nematode wherein FF proteins have been identified so far, the parasite Trichinella spiralis (Tsp) (divergence estimated more then 600 MYA; Mitreva and Jasmer, 2006).
