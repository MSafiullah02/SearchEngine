However, capsid or genome sizes by themselves are not determinants of complexity. For example, flexible filamentous viruses can reach lengths in the order of microns, but most of their capsid mass is built by a single capsid protein arranged in a helical pattern [1]. On the other hand, architecturally complex viruses such as HIV have moderate sized genomes (7\u201310 kb of single-stranded (ss) RNA) [2]. Structurally complex viruses incorporate a larger variety of components into their capsids than simple viruses. They may contain accessory proteins with specific architectural or functional roles; or incorporate non-proteic elements such as lipids.",

The more subtle departure from symmetry is the case when identical subunits occupy similar but slightly different environments, as in the case of quasi-equivalence in icosahedral shells (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_2). In other cases, virion components with different symmetry may interact with each other, forming a symmetry mismatch at the interface. In the extreme case, identical components may form morphological units with no symmetry, or even assemble in a completely different manner for each realization of the virion \u2013 this property is called pleomorphism. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_3) and X-ray crystallography (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_4) are helping to unveil the organization of complex viruses in great detail, including features that depart from strict icosahedral symmetry. Understanding the architectural details of asymmetric capsids is the most challenging problem, since structural biology techniques heavily rely on the use of symmetries to reach high resolution detail. Cryo-electron tomography (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_3) is helping to advance our understanding of these viruses, although the resolution currently attained is still in the 3\u20135 nm range.",

            "text": "A characteristic feature of complex viruses is the presence of multiple proteins in the virion, playing specific architectural or functional roles during the viral cycle. For example, different proteins may occupy the sixfold and fivefold coordinated positions in the icosahedral net (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_2). The specific architectural role of proteins at the fivefold vertices is often combined with a specific functional role, as will be described in Sect. 11.3. In icosahedral viruses with triangulation numbers T > 1, mobile terminal regions of the capsid proteins may adopt different conformations depending on their position in the capsid. In this way they act as molecular switches, enabling the same protein to occupy the different quasi-equivalent environments (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_2). In complex viruses, these mobile arms may still exist, but they often appear combined with a variety of minor capsid proteins, required for correct assembly of the virion. These cementing proteins can be considered as detached molecular switches, required to modulate the variety of interactions needed for assembly and stability of a complex capsid. One case where the intricate capsid organization includes: (i) biochemically different hexameric and pentameric capsomers; (ii) a network of mobile arms; and (iii) cementing polypeptides, has recently been described in great detail: adenovirus [3, 4].",

            "text": "Adenoviruses infect vertebrates. They enclose their dsDNA genome within a pseudo T = 25 icosahedral shell with a diameter of 950 \u00c5 between vertices. Trimers of the major capsid protein, hexon, constitute all the sixfold capsomers, while the vertices are occupied by pentamers of a protein named penton base. Although there is no sequence similarity between hexon and penton base, both have a very similar fold based on the eight-stranded \u03b2-barrel motif, or \u201cjelly roll\u201d, which allows appropriate interdigitation of the different capsomers to form the closed shell [5, 6]. Penton base folds as a single jelly roll. The hexon monomer folds as a double \u03b2-barrel jelly-roll perpendicular to the capsid surface (Fig. 11.1a). Thanks to this fold, trimers have a pseudo-hexagonal shape and can occupy sixfold symmetry positions in the icosahedron. Each capsid facet is formed by 12 trimers of hexon. The general icosahedral architecture of adenovirus can be described as two different systems of tiles. Nine hexon trimers form the central plate of each facet, known as GON (Group of Nine). The five peripentonal hexon trimers, together with the penton base, form the second tile system, known as GOS (Group of Six) (Fig. 11.1b). Numerous double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses share the basic jelly-roll fold in their capsid proteins and assemble capsids organized as combinations of tiles based on pentagonal and pseudo-hexagonal building blocks. In larger viruses, the tiles composed by the pentameric vertex and surrounding capsomers are known as pentasymmetrons, while the triangular tiles centered at the threefold icosahedral axis are called trisymmetrons. This efficient architectural solution facilitates construction of very large icosahedral capsids; triangulation numbers as large as T = 169 have been described, and larger ones are likely to exist [8, 9].\n",

            "text": "In adenovirus, apart from hexon and penton base, there are at least four other proteins making up the icosahedral shell. Minor capsid proteins IIIa, VI, VIII and IX are required for correct capsid assembly and occupy specific positions in the capsid (Figs. 11.1c, d, e), forming specialized networks that stabilize the two systems of tiles [3]. Polypeptide IX is the only cementing protein located on the outer part of the adenovirus capsid. It has an extended structure and forms a sort of hairnet keeping together the hexon trimers in each GON, and binding GONs to GONs across the icosahedral edges. The N-terminal domains of three IX monomers join via hydrophobic interactions at the icosahedral and local threefold axes in the GONs forming triskelion structures. A long, unstructured domain of each monomer runs in a different direction towards the facet edges, where the C-terminal \u03b1-helix joins with the C-terminal helices of another three copies of IX, different from those forming the N-terminal triskelion, to create a leucine 4-helix bundle. On the interior of the shell, each GON is further stabilized by copies of polypeptide VIII located around the icosahedral threefold symmetry axis. Also on the inner capsid surface, polypeptide IIIa mediates the interaction between penton base and the peripentonal hexons, to keep each GOS together. Finally, IIIa and VIII cooperate to bind each GOS to its five surrounding GONs. The remaining minor capsid protein, polypeptide VI, has not been unequivocally traced so far, but has been assigned to density within an internal cavity present in each hexon trimer.",

            "text": "Mobile regions of hexon and penton base also play a role in the extensive interaction networks in the adenovirus capsid. Due to their flexibility, these regions could not be traced in the crystal structures of the isolated proteins, but they adopt ordered conformations when they are within the capsid context. The N- and C- termini of the hexon monomer, located at the innermost part of the capsomer, adopt a total of 5 (N-) and 6 (C-) different conformations to establish interactions between neighbouring hexons, or between hexons and minor capsid proteins (Fig. 11.1f). Similarly, for each penton base monomer an N-terminal arm extends away from the \u03b2-barrels that form the main body of the protein towards the viral core, interacting with two IIIa monomers along the way, and therefore contributing to anchor the penton within the GOS. Interestingly, some of the interactions between cementing proteins and hexons, and among cementing proteins, occur by \u03b2-sheet augmentation. That is, the interaction is mediated by a \u03b2-strand from one of the proteins binding to the edge of a \u03b2-sheet in the other. This observation tells about the intricate organization of the capsid and makes us wonder about the difficulty of assembling all elements together. The fact that no high resolution structure is available for any of the minor capsid proteins in isolation suggests that they may require the virion context to fold properly.",

            "text": "Although in general it is understood that cementing proteins are required for correct viral assembly, it is difficult to pinpoint their exact role in morphogenesis. Some of them are dispensable for assembly, but required to reach structural stability; this is the case of adenovirus polypeptide IX [10]. Others are thought to play the role of \u201cmolecular rulers\u201d, determining capsid size. This role was proposed when the structure of bacteriophage PRD1 was solved by protein crystallography (see also 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_17). It was then found that minor capsid protein P30, required for assembly, runs beneath the icosahedral edges, from the vertex to the twofold symmetry axis. Thanks to its extended conformation, two copies of the 83-residue polypeptide can cover the 300 \u00c5 length of the capsid edge, and act as a tape measure during morphogenesis [11] (Fig. 11.1g). A further complication for determining the role of minor virion components in assembly comes from the fact that, in keeping with the genetic economy principle, they often play other roles different from the purely architectural one during the viral cycle. A remarkable example of this phenomenon is illustrated by adenovirus polypeptide VI [4]. This protein is involved in disrupting the endosomal membrane, so that the virus can escape into the cytosol after internalization. It also has a role in facilitating virion traffic to the nucleus along the microtubular network; acts as an activator of the adenoviral gene expression; and promotes transport of newly synthesized hexon to the nucleus. Finally, a C-terminal peptide of polypeptide VI activates the viral protease for maturation.",

Elucidating the organization of these additional components within the virion is not straightforward, since they usually do not follow defined symmetry rules, and their disposition may even change between particles of the same virus. Notable examples are viral proteases, such as the maturation protease VP24 in herpesvirus [12], or the adenoviral protease AVP [4]; and molecular motors involved in nucleic acid translocation, such as dsDNA packaging ATPases in bacteriophage and herpesviruses [13, 14], or the dsRNA packaging ATPase in cystoviruses (bacteriophage \u03a66) [15]. Viruses with RNA genomes must carry their own replication and transcription enzymes, to supply RNA metabolism functions absent in the cell [16]. Viruses that carry out their replication in the cytosol (e.g., vaccinia) must also supply DNA and RNA processing enzymes whose cellular counterparts are only present in the nucleus [17]. Some dsDNA viruses encapsidate basic proteins that help screen the nucleic acid charge repulsion, to facilitate compaction of the genome within the reduced capsid space. These basic proteins can be of cellular origin, such as in Simian Virus 40, which uses histones to pack its minichromosome [18]. Baculovirus [19], adenovirus [20], mimivirus [21] and poxviruses [17] encode their own DNA compacting proteins. The genomes of negative strand ssRNA viruses usually appear in the form of ribnucleoproteic structures [22]. More information on the packaging motors and on the organization of nucleic acids within viral capsids can be found in 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_12.",

Such is the case of influenza virus hemaglutinins [23], or Env proteins in retroviruses [2]. In the simpler enveloped viruses, such as Alphaviruses, the glycoproteins completely cover the lipid surface and follow the same icosahedral organization as the inner shell (T = 4) [24]. In other cases, such as retroviruses or herpesviruses (Fig. 11.2a), the structure directly in contact with the genome (nucleocapsid or capsid) is not in contact with the membrane, and the organization of glycoprotein spikes is irregular and does not reflect the organization of the virion inner contents [25, 26].\n",

In PRD1, some of the mobile arms in its major capsid protein are embedded in the outer leaflet of the membrane, contributing to enforce the icosahedral shape [11]. Icosahedral viruses with internal membranes have a large complement of virion-encoded membrane proteins: approximately half of the 18 proteins present in the PRD1 virion are membrane proteins [27]. The membrane in PRD1 can undergo a large conformational change and protrude forming a tube from one of the vertices. It has been proposed that this tube has a function in injecting the viral genome into the host cell, similar to that played by tail structures in other bacteriophages [28] (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_17).",

The mature rotavirus virion has a diameter of approximately 100 nm, and is organized in three concentric layers composed by four different proteins (Fig. 11.3). The innermost layer, or core shell, is formed by 120 molecules of protein VP2. Because of the number of protein monomers in this shell, it is described as having a T = 2 triangulation number, a conformation not allowed in the Caspar and Klug formalism [31] (10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_2). In fact, the VP2 monomers adopt two different conformations to yield a T = 1 icosahedron of asymmetric dimers. VP2 works as a platform for assembly of the next layer, formed by 260 trimers of protein VP6 in a T = 13 lattice. VP6 must be able to adopt not only the different conformations required for the T = 13 quasi-equivalence requirements, but also those extra ones required to compensate for the symmetry mismatch with the VP2 layer. The third, and outermost layer, is also a T = 13 icosahedron composed by 260 trimers of glycoprotein VP7, plus 60 spikes formed by trimers of VP4 that protrude from peripentonal positions. The VP4 spikes must be proteolytically cleaved for the virus to be infectious. Remarkably, after cleavage the fragments remain non-covalently associated on the virion surface, but undergo an intriguing conformational modification, changing from a trimeric arrangement to a mixture of trimeric, dimeric and monomeric associations. The VP1 and VP3 transcription enzymes are also part of the virion, and are located beneath the core shell surface.\n",

In rotavirus, the double layered particle formed by VP2 and VP6 is the transcriptionally competent form of the virus. The external layers carry the viral components in charge of initial interaction with the host: recognition, attachment and entry. These are shed once entry into a new host cell has been accomplished [32].

Solving the organization of mismatched features represents a remarkable challenge for structural biology techniques, due to the predominance of icosahedral symmetry in the complete virion that obscures them. In the Cystoviridae representative bacteriophage \u03a66, a hexameric ssRNA packaging ATPase occupies multiple fivefold vertices of the empty procapsid [15].

The knob is followed by a shaft of variable length and flexibility, depending on the serotype.

At the proximal part the shaft becomes frayed and three flexible N-terminal peptides spread out to attach to the penton base pentamer. The crystal structure of penton base in complex with an N-terminal fiber peptide [5] showed the peptide bound to a groove on the outer surface of the pentamer formed by the interface between two penton base monomers, reaching radially from the penton center to the outer rim. Five peptides were observed with equivalent density, implying that all fiber binding sites are equivalent. Therefore, in the virus the three N-terminal tails may adopt two different arrangements: either they occupy three consecutive grooves, or two of them are in neighboring binding sites and the third one is flanked by two empty grooves. In the recently solved cryo-EM atomic structure of the complete virion, density for the proximal part of the fiber shaft was observed protruding from the center of the penton base pentamer [3, 37]. Density for the fiber shaft is blurred by the enforced fivefold symmetry, but it could be observed that its base interacts with a hydrophobic ring at the rim of a narrow channel in the center of the penton. This hydrophobic interaction may allow relative rotation of fiber on penton to accommodate the symmetry mismatch, while the N-terminal tails secure the binding to the penton groves. Fiber binding to the adenovirus receptor in the cell results in its release from the capsid, which in turn induces a cooperative conformational change in the penton base pentamer. This change is thought to play a role in preparing pentons for release at a later stage of adenovirus entry and uncoating [4].\n",

Moreover, in PRD1 each spike has a different oligomerization state. P5 is a trimer resembling the structure of the adenovirus fiber; while the other, P2, is a monomer with a pseudo-\u03b2 propeller head.

A ring-shaped density is observed near the singular vertex inside the capsid, which may correspond to a portal structure involved in genome packaging; however, there is no indication of symmetry mismatch between the fivefold vertex and this ring [29]. The spike is too thin to be used as a DNA ejection tube; besides PBCV-1 is thought to deliver its genome into the host by fusion of the internal membrane with the host one.

Early images of Mimivirus showed a starfish-shape feature with five arms reaching from one of the vertices to the five neighbouring ones (Fig. 11.4e). The arms of the starfish are inserted between adjacent facets, opening a gap between them. The starfish is an independent macromolecular assembly that remains together when detached from the virion [21], and is the only part of the capsid not covered by fibers. When Mimivirus enters the cell by phagocytosis, a remarkable structural change occurs, whereby the five icosahedral facets in contact with the starfish feature open, leading to the structure called \u201cstargate\u201d [35]. The internal viral membrane is extruded through the stargate, to fuse with the phagosome membrane and release the viral DNA into the cytosol (Fig. 11.4f). Tailed phages use their special vertex both for genome packaging and delivery (Sect. 11.3.4; Chaps. 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_12, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_17).

In Myoviridae (representative: T4), the tail is composed by two layers of protein, one of them (the outer one) contractile [46] (Fig. 11.5a). The tail connects the head to a distal structure called the baseplate, formed by at least 16 different proteins in T4. Fibers with different lengths protrude from the baseplate; fibers may also be present at the portal region and the icosahedral head. In siphoviruses (representative: phage \u03bb), the tail lacks the outer contractile sheath. Research on the structure of non-contractile tails has unveiled a crucial structural element: the tape measure protein, whose length determines that of the tail by limiting the stacking of tail protein rings to a defined number. The baseplate composition is variable among the different viruses in this family, with some having only a simpler element called the tail tip complex. Fibers project both laterally from the periphery or longitudinally from the very the tip of the tail tip complex [47]. Podoviruses (representatives: T7, P22) have short tails, with a fiber complement that may include long, thin fibers (T7) or thick spikes (P22) [48]. Fibers, tails and baseplates or tail tips form the complex machinery required to initiate infection by recognizing and attaching to the host, and delivering the viral genome through the many layers protecting the bacterial cell (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_17).",

Icosahedral (prolate or not) heads have a singular vertex where a fivefold symmetric capsomer is replaced by a 12-fold ring of the portal protein [13]. The portal complex is connected to the tail, which in general follows sixfold symmetry along the tube and baseplate. In the case of myoviruses however, a further mismatch may exist, since the contractile sheath presents helical symmetry, and it is not yet clear if the inner tube follows the arrangement of the sheath or the sixfold symmetry observed in non-contractile tails [46]. Additionally, some podoviruses such as T7, incorporate an internal proteic structure referred to as the core. This structure grows from the portal vertex towards the capsid center, and is thought to serve as a spindle for wrapping the DNA. In T7, the core presents eightfold and fourfold symmetries [45] (Fig. 11.5b). Finally, another symmetry mismatch may appear when the packaging motor binds to the portal vertex in the prohead during encapsidation. Reported oligomeric states for components of packaging motors include pentamers (T4 gp17, \u03a629 pRNA), octamers (SF6 small terminase) and tetramers (\u03bb terminase). However, for some of these motors it is not clear if the oligomerization states found in recombinant proteins are the same than in the prohead (immature capsid) context [13].",

To complicate things even more, vaccinia virions exist in three different infectious forms carrying a different number of envelopes: mature virions, wrapped virions, and extracellular virions. The mature virion of vaccinia is a brick-shaped enveloped particle with approximate dimensions 350 \u00d7 250 \u00d7 150 nm (varying depending on the imaging technique used), composed by at least 75 different proteins [17]. Mature virions are intracellular forms of the viral particle. Wrapped virions are also found in the cells, and consist of mature virions surrounded by two additional membranes derived from the Golgi cisternae. Wrapped virions leave the cell by fusing with the cell membrane, leaving one of their envelopes behind, to produce the extracellular virion.\n",

The advent of electron tomography to visualize single virus particles (see 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_3) has started to reveal the architectural details of this kind of macromolecular machines, which includes many important pathogens for humans.

The capsid protein of retroviruses (CA) can assemble into either hexamers or pentamers, in much the same way as capsid proteins of icosahedral viruses (Fig. 11.6b). Recombinant CA forms only hexamers in certain conditions, giving rise to tubular oligomers or flat, ordered sheets; while when pentameric oligomerization is enforced, T = 1 icosahedral particles are formed [54, 55]. However, when CA hexamers and pentamers associate to form the closed mature capsid that contains the nucleocapsid complex including the ssRNA genome, they do it in such manner that the pentamers are not distributed regularly within the hexamer lattice. Even if a fixed number of 12 pentamers is incorporated into each capsid, the asymmetry of their distribution results in asymmetrical structures that can adopt shapes ranging from roughly spherical to roughly conical, and can be modeled using the geometrical principles governing fullerene cones (Fig. 11.6c).",

They have spindle-shaped virions with tails of variable length protruding from the spindle poles. One fusiform virus, Acidianus two-tailed virus (ATV) not only has an unusual shape, but is able to assemble new structural features after leaving the host cell. When propagated at temperatures slightly suboptimal for its host (75 \u00b0C), isolated virions look like ~0.2 \u03bcm long lemons. However, when temperature is raised in the absence of the host cell, these viruses grow two filamentous tails of variable lengths, one from each pole. This is the only known example of a virus with extracellular assembly, but it is likely that others exist [60].

In these long tailed bacteriophages, the head, fibers, and tail form separately (Fig. 11.8). Bacteriophage T4 head assembly starts from an initiation complex containing the portal protein gp20 bound to a cellular membrane. This complex recruits the components of a scaffolding core composed by eight different types of viral proteins, among them the main scaffolding protein gp22 and the viral protease (gp21). This core will later be coated by the hexameric and pentameric capsomers (gp23 and gp24) to form the procapsid, or prohead. Once coating is complete, gp21 is activated and cleaves all components of the procapsid except the portal protein. The prohead is detached from the membrane and most of the cleaved peptides exit the particle, opening the way for entry of the viral genome. Genome packaging leads to the large structural rearrangements involved in capsid maturation (Sect. 11.5.3 and 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_13), to produce the head in its final form. Finally, the head completion (or neck) proteins gp13, gp14, gp2 and gp4 attach to the portal to form the interface between the head and the tail.\n",

To form the T4 baseplate, proteins gp6, gp7, gp8, gp10, gp11, gp25 and gp53 assemble in the form of hetero-oligomeric wedges. Six wedges bind around a central hub containing gp5 and gp27. Proteins gp9 and gp12 (the short tail fiber) are then inserted at the gaps between wedges, and the interface between wedges and hub is sealed by proteins gp48 and gp54. This seal is the starting point from which the gp19 inner tail tube will grow. The length of the tube is controlled by a tape measure protein gp29, which extends from the hub to the tube end where the tail capping protein gp3 will bind. The tail sheath gp18 assembles around the inner tube, and finally the tail terminator protein gp15 binds to gp3 and the last row of gp18 subunits, making the tail ready to bind to the neck proteins in the head.",

The long tail fiber of bacteriophage T4 is kinked; the proximal part of the fiber before the kink is formed by a single protein (gp34), while the distal part contains three different proteins: gp35, gp36, and gp37. The proximal and distal parts assemble separately, and then join before attaching to the baseplate. All long tail fiber proteins form trimers, except monomeric gp35 (notice the symmetry mismatch) that sits at the interface between the distal and proximal half fibers. Interestingly, the long fibers cannot join the tail until it is bound to the DNA-filled head. A similar assembly pathway has been described for non-contractile long tails. In podoviruses however, the short tail is not assembled as a separate entity, but it grows outward from the portal vertex on the virion capsid. The careful temporal regulation of these assembly processes is proved by the fact that, when any of the structural proteins is absent, viral morphogenesis is interrupted and the assembly intermediates previous to the disrupted step accumulate in the cell.",

In the early stages of P22 morphogenesis, a procapsid is formed by 415 copies of the capsid protein, with approximately 300 molecules of scaffold inside. Unlike the capsid protein, the scaffold does not follow icosahedral symmetry; therefore, little is known about its organization in the assembly intermediate [45]. Scaffold proteins have been quite refractory to structural studies. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic studies on the scaffold of P22 and \u03a629 indicate that they have a helical fold. Biophysical analyses indicate that many of them share an extended, rod-like shape and a tendency to dimerize in solution [63]. However, an equilibrium between different oligomeric forms seems to be required to achieve correct capsid assembly. Kinetic studies have revealed that in phage P22, scaffold is predominantly a dimer during assembly, but the presence of free monomers is absolutely required to complete the head. Kinetically trapped intermediates are observed when monomers are depleted by decreasing the ionic strength, while restoring it eliminates the trap and allows elongation to proceed. Phage scaffolds are usually ejected from the procapsid immediately before genome packaging. In P22 and \u03a629, the intact protein exits the shell, and can be recycled in a new round of assembly. In other cases, the scaffold is removed via cleavage by a viral-encoded protease.",

The \u03a6X174 internal scaffold protein (protein B) helps in the early stages of assembly by preventing aggregation of the capsid protein F into aberrant oligomers, and ensuring the recruitment of the vertex spike protein G. The C-terminal region of protein B (24 aminoacids) interacts with the capsid and can be observed in the crystal structure of the procapsid, while the rest is disordered and appears to be largely tolerant to mutations. On the contrary, the external scaffold protein D is highly ordered and sensitive to mutations. Protein D is absolutely required for elongation (to assemble capsid pentamers into a spherical particle), while protein B helps to make assembly efficient but is not strictly required: in the absence of B, viral particles can be formed, but the process requires overexpression of protein D and takes as much as ten times longer than in the presence of both scaffolds. It is believed that scaffold redundancy confers an evolutionary advantage to \u03a6X174 by facilitating extremely rapid replication cycles.",

It follows from these observations that scaffolding proteins are involved in determining the correct curvature in the interactions between capsomers, so that they can form a closed shell of the appropriate size to hold the viral genome. A remarkable proof of this size determination role comes from the P2/P4 phage system [64]. Phage P2 is a member of the Myoviridae family, with an assembly pathway similar to P22 that includes a T = 7 procapsid formed with the help of an internal scaffolding protein, gpO. Remarkably, P2 gpO combines the function of scaffold and protease, able to cleave itself and other shell components at later maturation stages. In the presence of P4, however, the whole assembly pathway is altered. P4 is a replicon that can exist either as a prophage or a free plasmid, and does not code for any major structural proteins. However, P4 is able to sequester players of the P2 assembly line to form small T = 4 capsids where only its smaller genome can fit, excluding that of P2 (Fig. 11.9). This parasitic process is achieved by synthesis of a P4-encoded scaffold protein, Sid (SIze Determination protein). Sid forms an external scaffold on P2 assembly intermediates, forcing a narrower curvature and therefore a smaller icosahedral net. Unlike the internal scaffolds, P4 Sid forms a dodecahedral ordered cage that can be observed in cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions.\n",

For example, bacteriophage HK97 (Siphoviridae) does not encode a scaffold protein. Instead, a 103 residue stretch at the N-terminus of the capsid protein, known as the delta-domain, performs the scaffold function [65]. The delta domain is located towards the interior of the capsid and mediates interactions between capsomers during assembly. Once the procapsid is completed, and before the DNA is packaged, the delta domain is cleaved out by the viral protease, allowing the transition to the next assembly intermediate [62]. Adenovirus may use a dual system, including both a separate scaffolding protein [66] and flexible regions of minor capsid proteins removed by the viral protease during maturation [67].",

The capsid changes from a weak, labile object to a highly stable shell, ready to withstand the high internal pressure imposed by the tightly packed DNA inside [62] (see Chaps. 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_9, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_12, 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_18, and 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_19). In other viruses, such as polio [68] or adenovirus [67], maturation does not end with an extremely stable shell, but with a metastable one. This difference with respect to the bacteriophage case is likely related to the mode of infection of these eukaryotic viruses. Instead of ejecting the genome across the plasma membrane leaving the capsid behind, polio and adenovirus are internalized in the cell, and must be disassembled within in a concerted fashion to ensure exposure of the genome at the appropriate place and time for successful replication. Maturation prepares these viruses to start the programmed uncoating sequence upon reception of the appropriate signal, for example attachment to the receptor, or pH changes along the endocytosis pathway. Interestingly, in adenovirus maturation is related to genome packaging in quite a unique way. The adenoviral protease, which is the main maturation agent, is packaged together with the viral genome thanks to its dsDNA binding ability, and uses the dsDNA itself as a cofactor to increase its catalytic activity several orders of magnitude [4].",

Herpesviruses, which infect all sorts of animal organisms, share many structural characteristics with tailed bacteriophage [14]. They follow a similar assembly pathway, starting from an empty procapsid formed with the help of scaffold, and maturing to a more angular shell via large structural rearrangements upon DNA packaging. Like tailed bacteriophage, one of the vertices is different from the rest and contains a 12-fold symmetric portal structure involved in genome encapsidation. Herpesvirus capsid protein folds with a topology very similar to that of the HK97 phage family; and like tailed phages, the packed genome forms concentric shells when observed in icosahedrally averaged EM reconstructions. Finally, structural parallels also exist between Cystoviruses (dsRNA bacteriophage, representative \u03a66) and Reoviruses [70].",

First, since the design has been conserved throughout time, even after all traces of sequence similarity have disappeared, it must be a highly efficient arrangement. Second, it suggests that the architecture was established in the early stages of evolution, before the branches of the evolutionary tree diverged into the three kingdoms known today (archaea, bacteria and eukarya). One could wonder, then, if all complex viruses existing today fall within a limited number of structural solutions selected by their success early in evolution [71]. However, discovery of the unique architectures of archaeal viruses indicates that other structural solutions exist. Advances in high throughput virus isolation and structural characterization techniques will contribute to clarify this question.",

Accommodation of the different components often requires deviations from high order symmetry, from mismatches to pleomorphism; and involves complex regulation of the assembly dynamics.
