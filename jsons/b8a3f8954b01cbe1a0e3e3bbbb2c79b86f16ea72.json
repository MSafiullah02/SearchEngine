Efficient conversions were observed with palladium(II) acetate/Xantphos/cesium carbonate, in toluene at 100 8C. Reactions of the bromonucleoside derivatives could be conducted at a lowered catalytic loading [5 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /7.5 mol% Xantphos], whereas good product yields were obtained with a higher catalyst load [10 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 / 15 mol% Xantphos] when the chloro analogue was employed. Among the examples evaluated, silyl pro-tection for the hydroxy groups appears better as compared to acetyl. The methodology has been evaluated via reactions with a variety of arylamines and by synthesis of biologically relevant deoxyadenosine and adenosine dimers. This is the first detailed analysis of aryl amination reactions of 6-chloropurine nucleosides, and comparison of the two halogenated nucleoside substrates.",

            "text": "Palladium-catalyzed C \u00c0 N bond forming reactions have become an important type of transformation in the synthetic repertoire. [1] In this context, we have been gaining an understanding of and exploiting such catalyzed amination reactions of nucleosides. [2] The high biochemical, physiological and medicinal value of compounds that can arise by alteration of the nucleoside scaffold adds significant importance to the development of methods for nucleoside modification. [3, 4] In 1999 we demonstrated, for the first time, that N 6 -aryl-2'-deoxyadenosine analogues could be efficiently synthesized via C \u00c0 N bond-formation using a suitable Pd-ligand complex. [5] Subsequently, we analyzed a series of ligands for C \u00c0 C and C \u00c0 N bond formation. [6] This led to the identification of specific ligands that were effective for aryl amination. These included 2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-2'-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1,1'-biphenyl and (AE )-BINAP. In subsequent aryl amination work the same two ligands also proved to be useful in gaining access to N 6 -(6-benzo[a]pyrenyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine. [7] In all these cases, the halopurine nucleoside tested and used was 6-bromo-9-[2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-b-d-ribofuranosyl]purine. In comparison, there are fewer analyses of the use of the 6-chloroA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G purine nucleoside analogues in Pd-mediated amination reactions. Among these, reactions of 6chloro-9-[2,3,5-tri-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-b-d-ribofuranosyl]purine using Pd 2 A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (dba) 3 /BINAP with either Cs 2 CO 3 or t-BuOK were evaluated. [8] Although reactions of alkylamines proceeded well, comparable reactions of arylamines were not efficient. Using Pd-A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /(AE)-BINAP/Cs 2 CO 3 we have studied the amination of silyl-protected 6-chloro-9-[2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-b-d-ribofuranosyl]purine with a sterically-demanding alkylamino derivative of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. [9] Subsequently we have synthesized more elaborate carcinogen-nucleoside adducts using this chloronucleoside. [10] We have also studied C \u00c0 NA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (sp 2 ) bond-forming reactions of 6bromo-and 6-chloropurine nucleosides with azoles. [11] Despite these results, there has not been the development of effective Pd-catalyzed aryl amination methods to involve 6-chloropurine nucleosides. Also, no comparative performance evaluation of 6-bromoand 6-chloropurine nucleosides under Pd-catalyzed aryl amination conditions has been conducted. In this context it should be noted that S N Ar displacement reactions between a 6-bromopurine nucleoside and two arylamines have been accomplished, but reactions of corresponding 6-chloro compound are stated to be ineffective. [12] Pd catalysis appears to offer a simple, unifying method for involving both 6-bromo-and 6-chloropurine nucleosides in aryl amination reactions. This paper reports our studies on such reactions of these nucleoside derivatives.",

[13] Chloro nucleoside 2a [14] was prepared by silylation of 6-chloro-9-(2-deoxy-b-d-ribofuranosyl)purine [15] whereas 2b [11, 16] and 2c were prepared by silylation and acetylation of commercially available 6chloro-9-(b-d-ribofuranosyl)purine. Alternatively, 2c can be prepared by chlorination of inosine triacetate. [17] With these compounds, we began to evaluate conditions for aryl amination. We selected six ligands, 2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-2'-N,N-(dimethylamino)-1,1'-bi-phenyl (L1), (AE )-BINAP (L2), Xantphos (L3), 2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl (L4), 2-(di-tert-butylphosphino)biphenyl (L5) and 4-(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (L6) shown in Figure 2 . The first three were chosen since these have previously yielded effective amination catalysts for nucleosides, [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] whereas L4 and L5 were included due to their similarity to L1. Monophosphane L6 was included for comparison to L3. PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 and Pd 2 A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (dba) 3 were the metal sources, K 3 PO 4 and Cs 2 CO 3 were chosen as bases.",

Whether both phosphane units in L3 are critical for an effective catalyst was next queried. Use of L6 in place of L3 (entry 9) clearly showed that L3 was superior. Next, optimization of amination conditions with the chloronucleosides was conducted, starting with 2a. Use of 10 mol% Pd 2 A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (dba) 3 /30 mol% L1 with either K 3 PO 4 or Cs 2 CO 3 in DME gave ca. 50% product yields (entries 10 and 11). In contrast, this catalytic system with Cs 2 CO 3 in PhMe gave a high 80% yield (entry 12), but replacing Pd 2 A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (dba) 3 with 10 mol% Pd-A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 lowered the yield to 59% (entry 13). We next investigated the use of L2. At 10 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 / 15 mol% L2 an excellent 88% product yield was realized (entry 14), which decreased to 67% when the catalytic load was reduced by half (entry 15). When L2 was replaced with L3, the higher and lower catalyst load produced identical, good results (entries 16 and 17). On the basis of these experiments, substrate 2b was then investigated. At 10 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 / 15 mol% L2, again an excellent 88% yield of aminated product was obtained (entry 18), which remained unaltered when the catalyst load was decreased (entry 19). Upon replacement of L2 with L3, some other differences emerged. Use of the higher 10 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /15 mol% L3 resulted in an excellent 92% yield of product, but reduction of the catalytic load by half produced only a 74% yield (compare entries 20 and 21).

Thus, the combination of PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /L3/Cs 2 CO 3 in PhMe, at 100 8C is generally applicable for amination of 6-bromo-and 6-chloropurine nucleosides. However, a lowered catalytic load can be used for the former. We also compared reactions of acetate-protected derivatives 1c and 2c using the best conditions identified for reactions of the bromo-and chloronucleosides (entries 26 and 27). In both cases, although reasonable product yields were attained, the results were not superior to those involving the silyl-protected derivatives. Finally we tested 5 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (PPh 3 ) 4 under otherwise identical conditions. This Pd(0) catalyst has been used for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions of nucleosides. [23, 25] Both 1a and 2a reacted with p-toluidine, but these reactions (entries 28 and 29) were inferior to the low catalyst loading experiments with L2 and L3. On the basis of these results, we then evaluated the amination reactions using the silylated nucleoside substrates and several amines with varying electronic and steric properties. These results are displayed in Table 2 . From the results in Table 2 , it is evident that both bromo-(1a, b) and chloronucleosides (2a, b) are effective substrates for amination with a variety of arylamines. For reactions of the bromonucleosides 1a and 1b, conditions A [5 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /7.5 mol% L3] are reasonable for efficient reactions, and good-to-excellent yields were observed. Only the reaction of otoluidine with 1a gave < 70% yield (entry 13). On the other hand, all reactions with o-anisidine gave satisfactory results (entries [17] [18] [19] [20] . The electron-deficient p-acetylaniline reacted very well (entries 5-8), and good results were also obtained with m-cyanoaniline (entries 9-12).",

            "text": "When comparing these catalyzed transformations to the S N Ar chemistry of 6-halopurine nucleosides, the following are notable. The Pd-catalyzed reactions of 1b produced comparable yields to displacement reactions on 1c, [12] but require 3 times less arylamine. Also, Pd-catalyzed reactions with the chloronucleosides resulted in amination products, whereas such chloronucleosides were reported to be unreactive under S N Ar conditions. [12] Arylation of nucleosides by aryl bromides had been challenging until our recent report. [24] Thus, reactivity properties of nucleosides often do not follow known trends of simpler aryl systems. With the reactions of the simple arylamines completed, we next analyzed the use of nucleosides themselves as the arylamine in coupling reactions with the halonucleosides. Nucleoside dimers are of interest since they can be formed in vitro by nitrous acid-induced DNA cross-linking. Such a process could have a physiological role due to the presence of nitrite in cured meats. [26, 27] Pd-catalyzed approaches have been used for the non-biomimetic synthesis of adducts produced by DNA cross-link-ing. [28, 29] Among the various nucleoside dimers, deoxyguanosine-deoxyguanosine (dG-dG), deoxyadenosine-deoxyguanosine (dA-dG), and deoxyadenosinedeoxyadenosine (dA-dA), the synthesis of dA-dA posed particular challenges. For instance, reaction of 1a and 5a using several Pd/L2 complexes were reported to be low yielding, and thus use of the iodo analogue of 1a was necessary. [29] On the basis of our results, we wanted to reassess the reaction of 1a with 5a and analyze reactivity of the chloro analogue 2a for synthesis of dA-dA dimer. We also wanted to compare these reactions to those leading to the adenosine-adenosine (A-A, ribose) dimers (Scheme 1). The results of these experiments are shown in Table 3 .",

Instead, several compounds showed a mild cytostatic and/or cytotoxic activity against a variety of cell lines (CC 50 or MIC in the 10 to 100 mg mL \u00c01 range).

Herein we show that 5 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 / 7.5 mol% Xantphos is a generally effective catalyst in combination with Cs 2 CO 3 in PhMe at 100 8C for reactions of 6-bromopurine ribonucleosides as well as the 2'-deoxy analogues. Remarkably, the corresponding 6-chloropurine nucleosides are also excellent substrates for such reactions, requiring 10 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 / 15 mol% Xantphos, under otherwise comparable conditions. Finally, the method has been applied to the synthesis of deoxyadenosine-deoxyadenosine and adenosine-adenosine dimers. Bromo-as well as chloropurine ribo-and deoxyribonucleosides are effective substrates for reactions with protected 2'-deoxyadenosine and adenosine. Therefore, the methodology described appears to present broad generality and scope for nucleoside modification with both 6-bromo and 6chloropurine nucleosides.",

The exact opposite trend was observed with 2b, where the higher and lower loads of PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /L2 showed comparable results, but not with PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /L3. In an attempt to gain additional insight, three other reactions were conducted between 2b and the sterically hindered o-toluidine (entries[23][24][25]. Reaction of this amine and 2b catalyzed by 10 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 / 15 mol% L2 gave an 86% product yield, versus 73% with 5 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /7.5 mol% L2, both in 1 h. These yields did not change appreciably when the reaction was conducted over 2 h (entries 23 and 24, yields in parentheses). On the other hand use of 10 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /15 mol% L3 gave an excellent 92% yield (entry 25). A review of the data indicates that 10 mol% PdA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (OAc) 2 /15 mol% L3 gave consistently good results for reactions of both 2a and 2b.",

Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (100, 20, 4, \u2026 mg mL \u00c01 ) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. The CC 50 was defined as the compound concentration that resulted in a 50% reduction of the MTT-or MTS-directed (blue) viability staining of the (CRFK and MDCK) cell cultures. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human lymphocyte MT-4 cells (ca. 3 10 5 cells/mL) were infected with 100 CCID 50 of HIVA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (IIIB) or HIV-2-A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (ROD)/mL and seeded in 200 mL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 8C, virus-induced cytopathicity was recorded with the MTT dye staining method.",
