However, little is known about what fundamental mechanisms drive dynamical information flow in online social systems. Here, we introduce a generative model for online sharing behavior that is analytically tractable and that can reproduce several characteristics of empirical micro-blogging data on hashtag usage, such as (timedependent) heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity. The presented framework constitutes a null model for social spreading phenomena that, in contrast to purely empirical studies or simulation-based models, clearly distinguishes the roles of two distinct factors affecting meme popularity: the memory time of users and the connectivity structure of the social network.",

However, since we receive pieces of information from multiple sources, this has also made the information ecosystem highly competitive; in fact, users' influence and visibility are highly heterogeneous, and topics strive for users' attention in online social systems. Although several studies have described the dynamics of information flow in popular communication media [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , the main factors determining the observed patterns have not been identified, and there is no theoretical framework that addresses this challenge. Indeed, given the potential for applications-e.g., having more efficient systems to spread information for safety and preparedness in the face of threats-a better understanding of how memes (ideas, hashtags, etc.) emerge and compete in online social networks is critical.",

            "text": "Information often spreads through a social network as a cascade: A person adopts a new behavior, installs a new app, or sends a news item or rumor to his friends (e.g., by tweeting it on Twitter). The avalanche spreads if the friends decide to also adopt the new behavior and in turn pass on the social influence effect to their own friends, who may further propagate the behavior. Following the usage in the review [6] , we apply the term \"social spreading phenomena\" to describe such cascading or \"viral\" propagation [7] . The latter term is used because the description of information spreading bears some similarity to epidemics of contagious disease; the effects of network structure on disease contagion have been well studied by physicists [8] (see Ref. [9] for a recent review). However, unlike epidemics of a single disease strain, we focus on social spreading phenomena that occur in the presence of competition between a large number of different items of similar type. Examples of the types of items include URLs on Twitter [1, 2] , apps on Facebook [5, 10] , or videos on YouTube [11] . In each of these examples, users make choices-often influenced by the choices they have seen their friends make-and the accumulation of many choices leads to a distribution of popularity of the items: Some items become extremely popular, while other items remain obscure.",

Note that we do not restrict our study only to very popular memes; indeed, our interest is in understanding the entire popularity distributions of memes, from the unpopular to the very popular. This definition of a meme has also been used by researchers studying cascades on Facebook [14] , the spreading of news through blogs [15] , and the popularity of hashtags on Twitter [3, 16] , but it can also be applied to analyze popularity distributions of offline items (where copying promotes spreading) such as baby names [17] , dog breeds [18] , and even citations (which are a type of popularity measure) of scientific papers [19, 20] . The memes in these examples are all relatively simple units of information that are easily identified in data sets; recent work has also demonstrated that more complex memes (represented by the appearance of common phrases, such as \"quantum\" or \"graphene,\" in the scientific literature) can be recognized by their inheritance patterns in the citation network [21] .",

The statistical physics of avalanches has been studied in the context of condensed-matter systems, where the flip of a single magnetic spin domain can cause its neighboring domains to also flip and thus initiate a cascade [26] . If the physical parameters of such a system are tuned to place it at a critical point [27] , the sizes of avalanches are power-law distributed; the sandpile model of self-organized criticality (SOC) self-tunes so that the system balances at the critical point [28] . However, unlike the memoryless particles or magnetic spins that constitute the microscopic entities in condensed-matter avalanches, humans absorb and transmit information on a wide variety of time scales that range from seconds to weeks [29, 30] . Models of social interaction must therefore include \"memory\" effects (non-Markovian aspects) that lead to the emergence of characteristics that are qualitatively different from those seen in condensed-matter avalanches. The non-Markovian aspects of human temporal behavior have attracted considerable recent attention (e.g., Refs. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] ), but we wish to investigate the effects of memory on popularity avalanches caused by users choosing between multiple items that they have seen in the past.",

Our probabilistic model, in contrast to other studies [3] [4] [5] 19, 36] that use intensive computational simulations to fit to data, allows us to get analytical insights into the respective roles of the network degree distribution, the memory-time distribution of users, and the competition between memes for the limited resource of user attention. The model is a \"null model\" in the sense that it is analytically tractable, yet realistic enough to be fitted to empirical data and to reproduce some important characteristics of the data. We show that fitting to time-dependent data requires a nontrivial memory-time distribution, which is not possible with the toy model of Ref. [37] , where users can remember only one meme. However, the phenomenon of \"competitioninduced criticality\" that was first identified in Ref. [37] is shown to be robust to the inclusion of memory times, heterogeneous user activity rates, and complex network structures in the more realistic model used here. The current model requires more sophisticated mathematical analysis than that of Ref. [37] to deal with the long memory of users, but it enables us to understand how heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity evolve over a range of time scales, as a few memes \"go viral\" but the majority become only moderately popular.",

However, it should be clear that the model and its results can also be extended to the other examples of viral phenomena discussed above. For the adoption of apps on Facebook, for example, the memes are the notifications sent when a user installs an app [10] . If a friend is prompted by this notification to also install the app, then the meme propagates on the network and its popularity is measured by the number of installations of the app. We show that the crucial property of the model that poises the system at criticality is the competitive pressure for the limited resource of user attention, and this property is common to a broad range of social spreading phenomena that are characterized by the availability of large time-dependent data sets.",

In graph-theoretical terms, these relationships constitute directed links from the followed node (user) to the follower (Fig. 1) . The network structure is defined by the joint probability p jk that a randomly chosen node (user) has indegree j (i.e., follows j other Twitter users) and out-degree k (i.e., has k followers), but the network is otherwise assumed to be maximally random (a configuration model directed network). The mean degree of the network is z \u00bc P j;k kp jk \u00bc Each user has a \"stream\" that records all tweets received by the user, time stamped by their arrival time. We assume that only a fraction \u03bb of the tweets received are deemed \"interesting\" by the user, and only the interesting tweets are considered for possible retweeting by that user. (Here, we use the term \"retweeting\" in a general sense, to include any reuse of a previously received meme such as a hashtag. Note that a meme may be retweeted more than once by a user, unlike the model of Ref. [35] ). The activity rate of a user-the average number of tweets that she sends per unit time, i.e., the rate of the Poisson process that describes her tweeting activity-can depend on how well connected the user is within the social network [3] , and we assume it depends on her in-degree j and out-degree k [her \"\u00f0j; k\u00declass\" for short]; this assumption is supported by empirical evidence from Twitter (see Fig. 6 of Ref. [38] ). The user activity rates \u03b2 jk give the relative activity levels of users in the \u00f0j; k\u00de class; the rates are normalized by choosing time units so that P jk \u03b2 jk p jk \u00bc 1. If there are N users in the network, this rate implies that an average of N tweets are sent in each model time unit. To simplify the analysis, we sometimes specialize to the case where all user activity rates are equal: \u03b2 jk \u00bc 1.",

A Poisson process is characterized by an exponential distribution of interevent times, where each event corresponds to an innovation or a retweeting action. This assumption is contrary to studies such as Refs. [29, 30, [33] [34] [35] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] , where heavy-tailed distributions of interevent times are examined. Despite this, in our model the memory-time distribution \u03a6\u00f0t m \u00de directly influences the waiting times (or \"response times\") between the receipt of a specific meme and the retweeting of it. Indeed, if \u03a6\u00f0t m \u00de is a heavy-tailed distribution, then a meme received by a given user at time \u03c4 will be retweeted by that user at a time t (with t \u226b \u03c4) with probability proportional to \u03a6\u00f0t \u2212 \u03c4\u00de (the exact relation depends on how long the meme occupies the stream of the user). Therefore, a heavy-tailed memory distribution gives rise to a heavy-tailed waiting-time distribution for individual memes, despite the fact that the activity of each individual user is described by a Poisson process (cf. the heavy-tailed waiting-time distributions found in empirical studies of email correspondence [29, 30] ). It is clearly important to distinguish between the distributions of interevent times (for actions of users) and of the waiting times experienced by individual memes; the model assumes each user has exponentially distributed interevent times, but it can nevertheless produce heavy-tailed distributions of waiting times for memes to be retweeted.",

The identities of the k followers are chosen uniformly at random from the set of all users; in the N \u2192 \u221e limit, this gives a Poisson in-degree distribution p j which, for sufficiently large z, gives similar results to using the in-degree distribution p j \u00bc \u03b4 j;z , i.e., assuming every user follows exactly z others [37] . Each user has the same activity rate, so \u03b2 jk \u2261 1. Figure 4 (a) shows the fraction of memes that have popularity greater than or equal to n, at age a. Black symbols are the results of numerical simulations; the colored curves are determined from the large-a, large-n, \u03bc \u00bc 0 asymptotics of Eq. (A11), using the Laplace transform inversion described in Appendix B. The main figure in panel Fig. 4(a) shows results for networks with the scalefree out-degree distribution p k \u223c Dk \u2212\u03b3 for k \u2265 4 and exponent \u03b3 \u00bc 2.5 (with p k \u00bc 0 for k < 4); the inset shows the results for networks with a Poisson out-degree distribution with mean degree z \u00bc 11 matching that of the scale-free networks. The memory-time distribution is \u03a6 \u00bc Gamma\u00f0k G ; \u03b8\u00de, with k G \u00bc 0.1, \u03b8 \u00bc 50 for the scalefree case and k G \u00bc 0.1, \u03b8 \u00bc 5 for the Poisson case; the mean memory time for this distribution is T \u00bc k G \u03b8.",

As we saw in Sec.

The resulting popularity distributions q n \u00f0a\u00de show (for large n) a regime of linear-in-age growth, and in the case where \u03b3 \u2248 2, the rate of this growth depends only weakly on n.

In particular, our model does not include bidirectional edges (i.e., reciprocated following relationships, where user A follows user B and B also follows A), which are quite common in the Twitter network [69] but which violate the independence assumption of a branching process. However, numerical simulations in Ref. [37] using a real Twitter network for a zero-memory version of the model (Sec. S4 of Ref. [37] ) gave quite good agreement with branching process theory, despite the presence of a large fraction of reciprocal links in the graph. The conditions under which tree-based theories give good approximations for dynamics on nontreelike networks remains an active area of research [70] , and more work is required for further understanding. An important assumption of the null model is that all memes have equal fitness. This is consistent with randomcopying models of human decision making [36, 71] , where the quality of the product-here, the \"interestingness\" of the meme-is less important than the social influence of peers' decisions [72] . This neutrality of the model is at the root of the criticality of the dynamical system [39] . A related (discrete-time) model for the number of citations gained by scientific papers was analyzed in Ref. [19] , where the authors also extended their neutral model to include unequal fitnesses of papers. It is likely that our model could be extended in a similar way to incorporate a fitness parameter for each individual meme. Based on the results of Ref. [19] , we expect that our main results would be qualitatively unaffected if the distribution of fitness values over the set of all memes is strongly peaked (i.e., if most memes have roughly equal fitness values, with only the high-fitness outliers demonstrating supercritical popularity growth).",

III B). It would be interesting to relax this assumption, for example, to allow the activity of users to be described by models such as that of Ref. [73] or by inhomogeneous Poisson processes: The latter incorporates time-varying activity rates and thus could model the 24-hour variability in tweeting levels determined by daily patterns [30] . However, we believe that the near-critical aspect of the model will not be strongly affected by such generalizations. To see this, consider the heuristic derivation of the branching number \u03be that was described at the end of Sec. IVA. Over a sufficiently long time window W, the expected number of interesting memes received into the stream of a \u00f0j; k\u00de-class user is linear in the number j of users followed, and this remains true even for inhomogeneous Poisson (or even non-Poisson) activities, provided that the observation window is long enough (e.g., such that the average rate\u03b2 of incoming tweets should yield approximately similar values when time averaged over disjoint time windows of length W). Similarly, the expected number of retweets by the user during the time window can be written as in Eq. (23) but with the Poisson rate \u03b2 jk replaced by its time-averaged value. The calculations of Eq. (24) then proceed as before, leading to the conclusion that the branching number limits to the critical value of 1 as \u03bc \u2192 0, which implies that non-Poisson user activity rates (or burstiness) will not affect the criticality of the model, which is a long-time (i.e., ages of memes limited to infinity) characteristic. Of course, the short-term behavior of the model [such as the small-a behavior in panels (b)-(e) of Fig. 4 ] would be affected by introducing burstiness; incorporating such realistic features into the model is left as a challenge for further work. As a final comment on this topic, we note that the agreement (in Sec. VI) of our theoretical results with real data of a spreading process for which users' activity rates are not constant also provides indirect evidence that the phenomenology discussed is robust to the details of user activity burstiness.",

If the Facebook update messages that inform all friends of user A that she has installed a particular app are considered to be the memes in a version of our model, then the arguments of Sec.

Following very similar steps to calculate the expected number \u03be of children of a meme-see the calculations leading to Eq. (24)-we find that",

Such a near-critical branching process was hypothesized in Ref. [5] to explain the observed fat-tailed distributions of app popularity in Facebook data and the temporal characteristics of the adoption behavior. The cascade sizes for other forms of \"meme\" spreading on Facebook have also been observed to have fat-tailed distributions [14] . Other undirected networks to which the model should be applicable include YouTube [63] and Digg [2, 75] . Finally, our focus here has been on the statistical physics of the model, but for completeness, we should note the difficulties inherent in applying the model to data sets where memes may not be as simple to recognize and track as hashtags are. In Ref. [21] , for example, the process of extracting memes (representing popular scientific terms) from data (citation archives of scientific publications) is explained in detail, and such effort will generally be required to identify and track the memes to which this null model might be applied.",

We argue that null models are fundamentally important in this quest-and complement more data-driven approaches-as they demonstrate, for example, that extreme popularity can arise purely because of random fluctuations in the competition between memes for user attention.

The competition-induced criticality phenomenon identified in a zero-memory model in Ref.

The aim of a null model is not to perfectly reproduce every aspect of a data set but rather to help identify which features of the data can be reproduced using relatively simple models, thus to highlight aspects where more detailed modeling (or, perhaps, factors entirely outside the model) are required to match to data. In this respect, the null model highlights the fact that heterogeneity in activity rates is vital to accurately capture the q 1 \u00f0a\u00de curve [compare Figs. 6(d) and 7(d)], even though the time dependence of the bulk of the popularity distribution may be described reasonably well by a model with homogeneous activity rates [Figs. 6(a)-6(c)].",
