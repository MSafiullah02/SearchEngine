In this case, critically ill patient with COVID-19 received hydrocortisone 200 mg/day for 26 days, and PCR results from nasopharyngeal swab samples continued to be intermittently positive even until 42 days after symptom onset. Interestingly, those from the lower respiratory tract have been negative following 25 days after symptom onset. It is not certain whether the positive PCR results from the nasopharyngeal swabs are due to non-viable remnant RNA fragments or viable virus due to inadequate clearance caused by immunosuppressive therapy (i.e., hydrocortisone). Further study using cell culture is needed to examine the upper-limit of the duration of viable virus shedding in the presence of corticosteroid therapy.",

Corticosteroid therapy is a double-edged sword that can suppress inflammation while hindering pathogen clearance. In cases with MERS-CoV infection, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with decreased mortality but was associated with delayed viral clearance.4 In SARS, corticosteroid therapy was also associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA from the blood.5 Therefore, the exceptionally long duration of viral shedding in our patient may be due to long-term use of corticosteroid therapy, and further targeted study is needed to elucidate this issue.",

This is in line with the recent study about 15% of patients with COVID-19 who discharged had positive PCR results during the follow-up.8 Several news media also reported on recurrent SARS-CoV-2 positive results due to relapse, remnant RNA detection, or reinfection.9\n,\n10 Sharing the details of various experiences with persistent intermittent positive PCR results such as our current case would be valuable in tackling the issue of patients with recurrence of SARS-CoV-2.",
