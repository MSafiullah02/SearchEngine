Hallmarks of this disease are focal plaques of demyelination in the white matter of the CNS. Evidence for autoimmune processes in this disease is mostly circumstantial. First, autoreactive T cells are found in the blood of most patients. This by itself does not yet point to a role of these cells in the disease process, since CNS antigen-specific T cells are also normal components in the immune system of healthy individuals. However, experiments in animal models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis clearly demonstrated that such cells can initiate CNS inflammation once they are activated. Second, autoreactive T cells and antibodies have been found in MS lesions, and immunotherapies targeting CNS antigen-specific T cells may delay or ameliorate the disease progression in MS patients. However, the situation is much more complex. To date, no MS specific autoimmune response has been described. The triggers, which might set off or maintain autoimmunity in a chronic disease course lasting years or decades, remain unknown. Autoimmune responses in the CNS of MS patients are not invariably detrimental, but may even be beneficial. Finally, diffuse alterations indicating general neurodegenerative processes are present throughout the brain of many MS patients, and these alterations are not necessarily due to immunemediated mechanisms. Hence, there are still many gaps to fill in the \"autoimmune hypothesis\" of MS.",

Genetic factors are important in determining the susceptibility to develop this disease, but within families of MS patients no Mendelian pattern of inheritance is found (Kalman and Lublin, 1999) . Furthermore, studies on identical twins show that in addition to genetic factors other pathogenetic triggers have to be involved in disease induction. It is suspected that infections may act as triggers of disease, but so far no MS specific agent has been identified.",

Furthermore, a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease with close similarities to MS can be induced in many different animal species by active sensitization with brain tissue or specific brain antigens (Wekerle, 1998) . However, the concept of autoimmunity in MS is questioned frequently, since no unique, MS-specific autoimmune response has been identified to date. In addition, recent studies show that the disease process in MS is much more complex than previously thought. It includes an interindividual heterogeneity in the pathogenetic mechanisms of lesion formation, and the presence of a chronic neurodegenerative component with unknown relations to immunemediated processes (Owens, 2003) . In this chapter, we summarize current knowledge about the immunology and immunopathology of MS and discuss arguments for or against the \"autoimmune hypothesis\" of MS.",

            "text": "The clinical course of MS is highly unpredictable (Noseworthy et al., 2000) . It ranges from benign disease, in which patients only suffer from some relapses without the development of permanent clinical deficit, to acute fulminate courses, which lead to death of the patients within a few months after disease onset. In more than 80% of patients the disease starts with a relapsing course, characterized by episodes of exacerbations followed by remission and recovery (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, RRMS). After several years this relapsing course develops into a disease with a steady and uninterrupted increase of neurological disability, the so-called secondary progressive course of the disease (secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, SPMS). In 15-20% of the patients the relapsing phase of the disease is missing, and the patients follow a progressive course from the onset of disease. This form of MS is called primary progressive MS (PPMS). Using magnetic resonance imaging to follow the lesion development during these different phases of MS, it was shown that during the relapsing phase of the disease new lesions appear in the brain, which are associated with blood-brain barrier damage (Werring et al., 2000) . This suggests that these lesions are triggered by new waves of inflammatory cells, reaching the CNS tissue from the circulation by their passage through cerebral vessels. This is in marked contrast to the situation in the progressive phase of the disease (both in SPMS and PPMS), where new lesions are only rarely formed in the brain white matter, and where blood-brain barrier damage is not detected. Instead, profound abnormalities are found in the so-called \"normal\" white matter. This suggests a diffuse injury affecting the brain as a whole. Such diffuse changes can already be seen in early stages of RRMS and seem to gradually increase with time (Filippi et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "Since MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disease, which is, at least in northern Europe, often associated with the expression of the MHC class II antigen HLA-DR2, the search for autoimmunity was mainly a search for myelin antigens possibly recognized by brain-infiltrating CD4 + , MHC class II-restricted T cells. And indeed, T cells specifically recognizing myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (Pette et al., 1990; Kerlero de Rosbo et al., 1997) could be readily isolated from the blood of MS patients. However, such cells can be isolated from the blood of healthy individuals just as well, indicating that they are normal components of the immune system (Wekerle, 1998) . Then, the search was on for quantitative differences (Olsson et al., 1990b) in the antimyelin response of T lymphocytes found in the blood of MS patients and healthy controls. Here, simple assays such as testing for primary proliferation responses turned out to be insufficiently sensitive to detect such differences, with the exception of a single study showing stronger proliferative responses against MOG in MS patients than in controls (Kerlero de Rosbo et al., 1993) . The more sensitive approach using ELISPOT techniques proved to be more rewarding, pointing to increased T cell responses also to PLP and MBP (Olsson et al., 1990b) . Then, qualitative differences in the antimyelin response became the focus of intense research. It has been observed that monozygotic twins differ in their anti-MBP response. When both of the twins developed MS, they had a similar epitope recognition pattern, but when only one twin had MS, they differed more in epitope recognition (Utz et al., 1993) . Other studies revealed that the autoimmune response against MBP can be focused to a narrow, dominant peptide segment in some selected patients-a finding that contrasts with the broad peptide recognition pattern in controls. This narrow epitope pattern may be remarkably stable for several years over the course of the disease . However, in other patients the epitope recognition pattern radically changes over time. This was best demonstrated in human patients progressing from an isolated monosymptomatic demyelinating syndrome (IMDS) to clinically definite MS (Tuohy et al., 1998) . Coinciding with, or appearing soon after the diagnosis of IMDS, PLP-specific T cells from these patients recognized a single, specific PLP peptide.",

This change in T cell reactivity concurred with relapses and the diagnosis of clinically definite MS.

Evidence for such a disease scenario comes from a series of neuroparalytic accidents in humans receiving anti-rabies treatments with killed carbolized virus isolated from infected animal brains. Since these vaccines were contaminated with brain material, CNS antigen-specific T cells of the treated patients were activated and initiated CNS inflammation (for review see Bradl and Hohlfeld, 2003) .

However, it became also clear that not every activated CNS antigen-specific T cell will be autoaggressive and hence pathogenic. For example, C57Bl/6 mice harbor PLP-specific T cells in their immune repertoire, but activation of these cells by immunization with PLP fails to provoke CNS inflammation. This is in marked contrast to the situation in SJL mice. With the same treatment regimen, PLP-specific T cells of these animals initiate massive inflammatory lesions in the CNS. The differences between these two strains of mice can be ascribed to variations in the intrathymic expression of tissue-specific self-antigens and tolerance induction (Klein et al., 2000) .",

One requirement of an autoantibody to be directly pathogenic is that its target antigen is accessible in the intact tissue. Thus, the respective target antigen has to be located either on the cell surface or on extracellular matrix components. In contrast, most antibodies detected in MS patients are reactive with intracellular antigens such as MBP or neurofilament. The situation is different with MOG, which is a small immunoglobulin-like molecule expressed on the surface of myelin sheaths or oligodendrocytes (Linington et al., 1988) . Most anti-MOG antibodies detected in MS patients are pathogenetically irrelevant, since they are directed against linear epitopes hidden within the folded molecular structure (Brehm et al., 1999) . However, in a small subgroup of MS patients the antibodies recognize the conformational epitope of MOG, which is accessible on the surface of intact oligodendrocytes (Haase et al., 2001) and myelin sheaths. Since such antibodies drive demyelination in animal models of EAE (Linington et al., 1988) , it is likely that they are also truly pathogenic in humans, leading to antibody-and complement-mediated demyelination characteristically found in active lesions in a subset of MS patients .",

Several immunotherapies provided further evidence for the presence of autoimmune reactions in MS patients, in particular on the level of MBP-specific T lymphocytes. For example, MBP-reactive T cells suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS were depleted by subcutaneous inoculations with irradiated autologous MBP-reactive T cells (\"T cell vaccination\"). This treatment regimen resulted in the induction of CD8 + T cells that specifically suppressed the MBPreactive T cells (Zang et al., 2000) . It led, at least for an observation interval of 24 months, to a 40% reduction of the relapse rate (as compared to the pretreatment rate), and to a stabilization in lesion activity (Zhang et al., 2002) . Other immunotherapies used altered peptide ligands for MBP in MS patients. In these studies, T cells recognizing the putative target epitope for an autoimmune response, MBP 83-99 , were targeted with peptides differing from the peptide normally recognized by one or two amino acids, in the hope to modulate the T cell response to the native peptide antigen. The outcome of these trials was inconclusive. One group described the induction of regulatory type 2 helper T cells, and a reduction in the volume and the number of lesions (Kappos et al., 2000) . Another group found exacerbations of MS directly linked to the activation of MBPspecific T cells in a subgroup of patients (Bielekova et al., 2000) . In sum, both of these immunotherapies provide evidence for a role of myelin-specific T cells in the disease. However, there is no evidence that these cells are directly involved in the initiation of MS.",

However, subsequent studies found a much less clearcut correlation between disease activity and loss of suppressor function (Antel et al., 1985) or changes in peripheral CD8 + T cell numbers (Hughes et al., 1988) . Reduced numbers of NK1 T cells with putative regulatory function, observed within inflammatory infiltrates in MS lesions, also suggest a defect in the termination of local immune responses (Ill\u00e9s et al., 2000) .",

Indeed, therapeutic strategies, which are believed to shift the immune response from Th1 to Th2 reactions, show some beneficial effect, in particular in patients with acute or relapsing disease (Neuhaus et al., 2000) . Taken together, there are only few studies addressing the question of possible regulatory defects in MS patients, and the results of these studies are, at present, far from being conclusive.

            "text": "Based on extensive studies it became clear that chronic inflammatory demyelinating diseases reminiscent of MS can be induced in experimental animals by several different viruses causing, for example, Theiler's virus-induced encephalomyelitis (Drescher et al., 1997) , corona virus-induced demyelinating encephalitis (Nagashima et al., 1978) , and canine distemper virus encephalitis (Summers and Appel, 1994) . In most of these models the disease starts with a panencephalitis, affecting both the gray and the white matter, which leads to injury of glia cells and neurons. While the infection is gradually cleared from the CNS gray matter, it may persist in the white matter and may cause a slowly progressive inflammatory demyelinating disease culminating in the formation of focal plaques of demyelination (Dethlefs et al., 1997) . Tissue damage is mediated by both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells: while class I-restricted T cells appear to be particularly important in the induction of axonal damage and clinical deficit, both T cell populations seem to be involved in the induction and progression of demyelination (Murray et al., 1998) . An important lesson from these animal models is that viral infections can induce autoimmune reactions against components of the CNS tissue, which may be involved in the propagation of chronic disease, possibly by antigen or determinant spreading (Croxford et al., 2002) . This implicates a contribution of autoimmune T cells to the chronicity of the inflammatory reaction and to the induction of tissue injury. Since the virus is not completely eliminated from the CNS of the experimental animals, it remains unclear whether virus-induced autoimmunity alone, in the absence of viral persistence in the CNS, could maintain a long-lasting chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease.",

The fact that these animals remained healthy when they were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions but developed spontaneous CNS inflammation when they lived in a normal environment (Goverman et al., 1993) led to the suggestion that the activation of T cells before their entry into the CNS may result from the action or recognition of bacterial/viral proteins. A similar, systemic trigger was also postulated for patients with early relapsing/remitting MS, since lesions appear concurrently in the brain and the spinal cord (Thorpe et al., 1996) . Clear evidence for an activation of CNS antigen-specific T cells by infectious agents came from the pioneering work of Wucherpfennig and Strominger (1995) . They demonstrated that MBP-specific T cell clones derived from MS patients can be activated by peptides derived from herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza virus, or Pseudomonas-and the list of such viral or bacterial peptides increased ever since (Hemmer et al., 1997) .",

A complete HERV-W provirus is present on chromosome 7, in a region associated with susceptibility to MS (Charmley et al., 1991) . We recently detected HERV-W retroviral antigens in neurons, axons, and endothelial cells of active MS lesions (unpublished observation). However, their expression in inactive lesions was low or absent. It will have to be determined in the future whether this virus is activated in response to the stressful environment of an MS lesion or whether immune responses to such retroviruses cause the development of MS and/or the propagation of lesions.

However, they share this with healthy subjects just as well. All other features of the disease seem to be rather patient-specific: the trigger of the disease, the disease course, the pathological characteristics of the MS plaque, the contribution of the immune system to the pathological changes in the CNS, the (auto?)antigens recognized by T cells and/or antibodies, and even the response to treatments. There is evidence that autoimmune processes could be involved in every single aspect mentioned above. Bringing all these aspects together to a uniform picture of MS remains a challenge for the future.",
