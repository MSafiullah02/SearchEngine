            "text": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of low-temperature laminar flow ward (LTLFW) on the Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia (MDR-ABP) in neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU) patients. We evaluated whether patients in a LTLFW had significantly improved clinical outcomes as compared to those in nonconstant-temperature NICU (room temperature). The association of temperature with the prevalence of ABP and A. baumannii isolates (ABI) found in NICU patients was specifically investigated. In vitro microbiological experiments were conducted to measure the proliferation, antibiotic sensitivity, and genomic profiles of A. baumannii (AB) that grew in variable temperatures. MDR-ABP patients in LTLFW had significantly improved outcomes than those in the room temperature NICU. In addition, the numbers of ABI were positively associated with mean ambient outdoor temperatures (P = 0.002), with the incidence of ABP and average numbers of ABI among NICU patients being substantially lower in the winter as compared to other seasons. However, there were no significant seasonal variations in the other strains of the top five bacteria. Consistent with these clinical observations, AB growing at 20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C had significantly reduced viability and antibiotic resistance compared to those growing at 35\u00b0C. The expression of genes related to AB survival ability, drug resistance, and virulence also differed between AB growing at 20\u00b0C and those at 35\u00b0C. LTLFW is effective in promoting the recovery of MDR-ABP patients because low temperatures reduced the density and virulence of AB and enhanced the efficacy of antibiotics, likely at the genetic level.",

However, several studies have shown that hospital-acquired infections with Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), especially AB, but not those with Gram-positive bacteria, are more common in the summer and are associated with high ambient outdoor temperatures (AOTs) [7] [8] [9] [10] . The underlying mechanism for this seasonal variation remains poorly understood [10] . Studies reported in the literature are limited to the ward-based continuous surveillance, which could not determine whether A. baumannii isolates (ABI) are infected or colonized. Information on patient-specific analysis is scarce, and the independent association between bacterial infections and temperature is inconclusive, primarily due to the presence of considerable confounding variables [5, 8] . These reports also fail to provide practical temperature-related guidance for improving clinical outcomes of ICU patients.",

These factors were chosen because of their demonstrated roles in the viability, resistance, and virulence of AB [22, 23] . OmpA is a major AB virulence factor, essential for killing host cells, whereas both Bap and Bfs support the formation of biofilm, which protects the bacteria from host immune response. The formation of biofilms results in persistent and difficult-to-treat chronic infections [23] . RND pumps and intI1 play a crucial role in intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance and are also vital for exhausting biocides, dyes, detergents, and organic solvents from AB. Three RND pumps have been reported in AB: AdeABC, AdeIJK, and AdeFGH [22, 24] . In addition, Fsr (Ferric siderophore receptor), which has been shown by De Silva et al. to upregulation at low temperature, was used as the control gene [23] . Table S1 lists the primers used for qRT-PCR. The expression of target genes was normalized against 16SrRNA, which served as the baseline control, using the 2 -\u0394\u0394C\u0442 method.

Therefore, cefoperazone/ sulbactam was used for testing the impact of temperatures on antibiotic resistance. Consistent with the clinical observations, AB growing at 20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C had a significantly reduced viability and were more sensitive to antibiotics as compared to those growing at 35\u00b0C (P < 0.001).

This clinical study was synergized with a microbiological study of the temperature-related characteristics of AB bacteria. We made several key observations. First, we demonstrated that patients with MDR-ABP treated in a LTLFW ward had a higher rate of recovery from MDR-ABP and overall good prognosis, resulting in significantly reduced inhospital mortality (10.00%) as compared to those in regular NICU wards (31.75%). Our finding is also consistent with the previous reports that the crude mortality rates of patients with MDR-AB infections were 26%-47.8%, with 10%-43% attributable mortality [20, [25] [26] [27] . In addition, we found that the overall incidence of ABP (6.45%, 3.47/1000 patient-days) in our NICU was obviously lower than the incidences (17.00-27.63%, 4.18-14.26/1000 patient-days) have been reported [27] [28] [29] . The PABTBI of 16.39% was also lower than that of 19.1%-38.7% in other ICUs as previously reported [30, 31] .

This may be the Fig. 3 The new ABP cases in summer were significantly higher than those in winter and autumn. One-way ANOVA analysis, P = 0.002. Bonferroni test, ** P = 0.002, * P = 0.027. ABP, the new cases of ABP patients in each season; MeanTemp, the average daily temperatures of each season; no, number;\u00b0C, degree Celsius reason why AB infections are particularly common in the summer or tropical climates [12, 28, 35] , where GNB, especially those environmentally acquired, proliferate faster and have enhanced virulence, increasing their colonization and infection [36] [37] [38] [39] . High temperatures may also promote the formation of a biofilm \"bloom\" of Acinetobacter species [40] . Similar seasonal variations have also been reported for other GNB such as K. pneumoniae and E. coli [37, 38, [41] [42] [43] , as compared to Gram-positive infections that are more common in the winter [9, 44, 45] . Interestingly, we observed the seasonal variations primarily for AB, not for other strains of the top five bacteria tested.",

Furthermore, the expression of genes related to vitality, virulence, and antibiotic resistance of AB is significantly reduced when they were cultured in 20\u00b0C compared to those grew at 35\u00b0C. De Silva et al. suggested that the upregulation of Fsr may be due to lower iron transport efficiency at low temperature [23] . This finding may explain why patients with MDR-ABP treated in LTLFW wards achieved significantly improved outcome. Owing to the ability to survive on environmental surfaces and patients skin, AB strains can cause widespread contamination and cross-infection in the hospital environment [12, 27] . An increased density of environmental AB will increase the probability of human's exposure. The ability to invade human tissues may increase owing to the expression of virulence factors, and increased resistance makes it difficult to cure.
