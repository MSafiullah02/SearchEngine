This recognition has fueled efforts for the discovery of effective therapeutics. While recent progress in drug discovery has been encouraging, there are presently no acceptably effective parasite-specific drugs for the disease. The urgent need for new drug discovery or drug repurposing has also increased the need for refined animal models of clinical disease for therapeutic efficacy evaluation. Here, we describe an acute model of cryptosporidiosis using newborn calves to evaluate well-defined clinical and parasitological parameter outcomes, including the effect on diarrhea severity and duration, oocyst numbers produced, and multiple measures of clinical health. The model is highly reproducible and provides unequivocal direct measures of treatment efficacy on diarrhea severity and parasite replication.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Cryptosporidium species are among the leading causative agents of diarrhea in humans and agriculturally important livestock species throughout the world, namely calves [1] [2] [3] .

The only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for treating cryptosporidiosis in humans is nitazoxanide [4] . However, the efficacy of nitazoxanide against Cryptosporidium in immunocompetent humans is marginal and the drug has no treatment benefit against the parasite in AIDS patients [5] [6] [7] .

During the 10-14-day-old age period most often used, neonatal calves are functional monogastrics and remain so up to 4 weeks of age [8, 9] . Clinical symptoms and diarrhea severity and duration following experimental infection in calves closely mirror what is observed in humans [8, 10] . Further, the anatomic distribution of infection in the GI tract and lesions are essentially the same as those observed in humans [8, 10] . Given these observations supporting the validity of calves as a useful clinical model most closely approximating human cryptosporidiosis, multiple methodologies and experimental designs for evaluation of therapeutics in the model have been published. The most commonly used calf models differ mainly in (1) frequency of fecal collection, (2) type of calf housing used (elevated stalls, or box stalls/pens), (3) whether total daily fecal volume excreted is collected, or a ~10-15 mL fecal sample is obtained per rectum once or twice daily, (4) methods used for determining diarrhea severity (quantitative or semi-quantitative), (5) methods used for evaluating oocyst shedding (quantitative, e.g., qPCR or hemocytometer enumeration of the total number of oocysts shed in total daily fecal collections, or various semi-quantitative measures, e.g., acid-fast stain or immunofluorescence assay on fecal sample smears and microscopic scoring, or qPCR on fecal samples collected every 12-24 h), (6) trial duration and (7) C. parvum isolate used (field vs characterized) [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Total daily fecal collection is required to unequivocally determine diarrhea severity and total number of oocysts produced and requires housing in elevated stalls [11] [12] [13] ; these measurements are not possible with box stall or pen housing in which a ~10-15 mL fecal sample is collected daily per rectum [14] [15] [16] . Model designs vary between investigator and institutional factors (e.g., housing facilities and equipment availability, investigator preferences, staffing resources and abilities, budgetary constraints) and can influence the accuracy of results for efficacy parameters. Therefore, the experimental design used in a particular calf model study should be considered when interpreting efficacy results of a given therapeutic and when making comparisons between studies. For example, in one calf model of cryptosporidiosis, treating calves with nitazoxanide reduced the duration of C. parvum oocyst shedding and diarrhea severity [14] , while in another calf model, nitazoxanide had no therapeutic or prophylactic efficacy against clinical disease caused by C. parvum, and in some C. parvum-infected calves nitazoxanide treatment actually prolonged and exacerbated diarrhea [15] . In a calf model similar to the preceding, paromomycin demonstrated prophylactic efficacy against C. parvum challenge and proof of concept, but the drug dosage required was determined to be cost prohibitive for veterinary use [16] . While there is no universally applicable design for the calf model given geographic, institutional, and laboratory constraints, we have used the acute model described here to consistently replicate data demonstrating therapeutic efficacy for multiple bumped kinase inhibitor (BKI) drugs for further study, as well as to consistently replicate data demonstrating lower, clinically less satisfactory efficacy for other BKIs to eliminate from further study [11, 17] (M.W.

Determining total daily fecal volume and consistency for each calf provides an objective and unequivocal direct measure of diarrhea severity. Total daily fecal collection is also the preferred practice in human challenge studies to evaluate the efficacy of candidate anticryptosporidial preparations [18] . In addition, total daily fecal collection allows accurate determination of total number of oocysts produced per day as an unequivocal measure of treatment effect on parasite replication, and also avoids potential error resulting from diurnal variations in oocyst shedding we have observed in this model [11] (see Note 1). Reduction of oocyst shedding is an important treatment outcome when considering the epidemiologic importance of the environmental parasite burden and exposure risk to both humans and livestock [19] .

This allowed individual calves to be housed in larger box stalls. However, fecal collection bags invariably leaked or became detached and failed completely, despite emptying up to three times daily. Emptying the bags also required manual restraint of calves and resulted in visible distress. Given all of the above, housing of calves in elevated stalls in this acute model design is thus scientifically and ethically justified and is approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The method presented here is completed in the following major sequential steps or procedures to evaluate therapeutics in this calf model of cryptosporidiosis: (1) procure isolated Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and age-matched (within 12 h) newborn pathogen-free Holstein bull calves for therapeutic efficacy evaluation, (2) manage husbandry of calves housed in elevated stalls, modified to accurately evaluate clinical health parameters, diarrhea severity, parasite production and urine production, (3) infect calves with C. parvum at 36-48 h of age and administer candidate therapeutic agents per the appropriate dosage and treatment regimen commencing at 2 DPI, (4) collect and process feces to determine total daily fecal volumes and total daily oocyst counts, (5) complete terminal procedures and euthanize calves at 10 DPI, and (6) analyze data for significant treatment effects on clinical health, total fecal volume (diarrhea severity), total oocysts produced (parasite replication), total urine volume (an additional index of hydration), and body weight gain or loss. [11] [12] [13] . Based on the large number of unsolicited outside requests we receive for testing of candidate anti-cryptosporidials in this model from industry and established Cryptosporidium investigators at other institutions, we presume that the model is a preferred practice. However, the model should only be used for further evaluation of lead candidate therapeutics or prophylactics which have demonstrated highly significant anti-cryptosporidial activity in vitro and in at least one less sentient species rodent model such as neonatal mice. While neonatal mice are the lowest species suitable for initial in vivo evaluation of therapeutics against Cryptosporidium parvum, the infection is asymptomatic. However, reduction of infection levels in the neonatal mouse model has positive predictive value for therapeutic efficacy against C. parvum in clinical models of disease including calves [11, 13, 21, 22 ].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 157, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1736, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1741, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1742, "end": 1746, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2632, "end": 2636, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2637, "end": 2640, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2641, "end": 2644, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2647, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "1.

In these propagation calves, total AM and total PM feces excreted by each calf were collected separately each day, to prioritize and exclude any potential low count collections from laborious oocyst purification procedures. Using the oocyst quantitation methods described in Subheading 3, but before we adopted the use of a blender to homogenize feces, we observed that oocyst counts per gram of feces in AM and PM collections from an individual calf could vary by ten-fold or more on some days, up to 46-fold in one calf (Fig. 2a, b) .

Additional calf data demonstrating diurnal variation in oocyst shedding in identically infected calves used for C. parvum oocyst propagation (calves 6-10) are newly reported here produced highly variable amounts of mucus in feces. We observed microscopically that large numbers (wall to wall sheets) of oocysts were entrapped in mucus in such cases, while more watery fecal components were often only sparsely populated with oocysts. Whether the observed oocyst count variations in AM vs PM collections represent true diurnal variation or skewing of oocyst counts by entrapment of oocysts in fecal mucus produced by some calves is unclear.
