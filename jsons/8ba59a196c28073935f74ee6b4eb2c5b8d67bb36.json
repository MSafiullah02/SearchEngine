While the scientific basis for the scare must seem plausible, the threat must also contain a powerful element of uncertainty. It must in some way be ill-defined, maximizing the opportunity for alarmist speculation as to the damage it might cause. . Society's response to the threat must be disproportionate. It is this more than anything which defines a true``scare''; that, even where the threat is not wholly imaginary, the response to it is eventually seen to have been out of all proportion to its reality.",

As more and more people turn into rhinos, the pressure to conform by doing likewise becomes intense. Today, we witness just such a pressure on politicians, scientists, and the public to jump on the global-warming bandwagon. Even George W. Bush, who in his tenure as President of the United States had opposed every single effort to legislate even the most mild and moderate steps to improve or protect the environment, began to weaken on global warming in 2007. Former Vice-President Gore led a national campaign to raise consciousness about the dangers of global warming, based heavily on the hockey stick model. His efforts netted him the Nobel Peace Prize. The United Nations, through its Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has similarly taken an alarmist position, also dependent on the hockey stick. The Union of Concerned Scientists, and a number of U.S. governmental agencies have taken similar positions. In addition, quite a large number of scientists have also become very concerned regarding the potential impacts of global warming.",

Or best-selling ecologist Paul Ehrlich in 1968:`The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s [`and 1980s' was added in a later edition] the world will undergo famineshundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked on now . . . nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.' Or Jimmy Carter in a televised speech in 1977:`We could use up all of the proven reserves of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade'.`P redictions of global famine and the end of oil in the 1970s proved just as wrong as end-of-the-world forecasts from millennialist priests. Yet there is no sign that experts are becoming more cautious about apocalyptic promises. If anything, the rhetoric has ramped up in recent years. Echoing the Mayan calendar folk, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock one minute closer to midnight at the start of 2012, commenting:`The global community may be near a point of no return in efforts to prevent catastrophe from changes in Earth's atmosphere'.`O ver the five decades since the success of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1962 and the four decades since the success of the Club of Rome's The Limits to Growth in 1972, prophecies of doom on a colossal scale have become routine. . . . The past half century has brought us warnings of population explosions, global famines, plagues, water wars, oil exhaustion, mineral shortages, falling sperm counts, thinning ozone, acidifying rain, nuclear winters, Y2K bugs, mad cow epidemics, killer bees, sex-change fish, cell-phone-induced brain-cancer epidemics, and climate catastrophes.'' Ridley described exaggerated predictions of catastrophe due to synthetic pesticides, DDT in particular, air pollution, acid rain, loss of the ozone layer, 1976 swine flu panic, mad cow disease, Ebola, SARS, a virus from civet cats, 2005 bird flu, famine and overpopulation, resource depletion: oil and gas, metals, and species extinction.",

In the climate debate, we hear a lot from those who think disaster is inexorable if not inevitable, and a lot from those who think it is all a hoax. We hardly ever allow the moderat\u00e8 lukewarmers' a voice: those who suspect that the net positive feedbacks from water vapor in the atmosphere are low, so that we face only 1 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming this century; that the Greenland ice sheet may melt but no faster than its current rate of less than 1 percent per century; that net increases in rainfall (and carbon dioxide concentration) may improve agricultural productivity; that ecosystems have survived sudden temperature lurches before; and that adaptation to gradual change may be both cheaper and less ecologically damaging than a rapid and brutal decision to give up fossil fuels cold turkey.''",

These typically include events that either occurred a long time ago or that occurred at distant sites not accessible to us, or both. Examples include the expansion of the universe after the Big Bang, the variations in climate of the Earth in the past or in the future, the origin of life on the Earth, putative existence of life elsewhere in the universe, the evolution of species on the Earth, continental drift, and other such topics. There is no way to go back into the past or travel great distances to directly verify hypotheses. Although the remnants of the past may be discernible to some extent in proxies that exist in the present, these tend to have significant limitations. For such phenomena that occurred long ago and/or in distant locations, scientists create hypotheses that would`e xplain'' how these processes might have occurred in conformity with the known laws of science. If these hypotheses provide a reasonable explanation of phenomena and are in conformity with scientific laws, they acquire the elevated status of a theory. Such a theory is typically not unique and represents one viewpoint. It provides one possible explanation for events that cannot be directly verified. Scientists are put in the position of detectives trying to solve a crime by piling up circumstantial evidence. In the case of evolution and continental drift, the circumstantial evidence is very strong and any sensible person would accept that these theories are almost certainly valid.",

What happens is that one of the unprovable hypotheses in a subjective science gains popularity amongst scientists and is regarded by the majority as the most credible alternative. When a significant number of scientists agree, a consensus evolves. The consensus acts like a gigantic gravitational field, drawing in more and more scientists. Eventually, the consensus gels, and ultimately hardens into a belief system\u00d0an orthodoxy. The foundations are often weak, and not understood by the public. The emergence of the consensus as the essence of reality in science has replaced scientific skepticism, and, as Lindzen (2008) has noted:``. . . simulation and programs have replaced theory and observation, where Government largely determines the nature of scientific activity''. As Lindzen (2008) emphasized,``the bulk of the educated public is unable to follow scientific arguments; knowing' that all scientists agree relieves them of any need to do so.'' Taking issue with the consensus``serves as a warning to scientists that the topic at issue is a bit of a minefield that they would do well to avoid''. It should also be noted that many climatological publications are so full of jargon and so obscure that they are unreadable except to a very few narrow specialists. So, not only the general public, but even much of the science community is unable to digest these abstruse treatises.",

One is the``consensus findings'' of the IPCC regarding the role of greenhouse gases on warming over the past century, and the other is a review of philosophical views of consensus in science. They reviewed a number of philosophical questions regarding the role of consensus in science. They concluded:`A rguing from consensus to enforce conclusions does not work with the extended peer community. What is needed are serious attempts to engage the extended peer community with the modes of expert reasoning used to reach those conclusions.'' There seems to be quite a bit of confusion in the world of climate science as to what the consensus is consenting to. For example, Curry and Webster focused on a IPCC conclusion that warming in the 20th century was primarily caused by anthropogenic generation of greenhouse gases.

Weather, ocean currents, and other aspects of the Earth system can vary widely, triggering feedbacks that produce longer-term variations (i.e. internally generated climate change).

Unfortunately, his notion of scientific rigor seems to be that it is supported by a consensus. His report emphasizes the necessity of repeatability in the scientific method; for example, it says:``A scientist tells how he or she arrived at a conclusion in enough detail so that another investigator can follow the same trail, examine the same data, and get the same answer.'' Yes, repeatability is necessary, but not sufficient. If the method of processing the data is arbitrary or possibly improper, successive investigators can reproduce the results but they will be just as arbitrary or inaccurate as they were before they were replicated. Ward (2008) mixes up two requirements of the scientific method. There is a huge difference between, on the one hand, applying a hypothesis to a large array of independent phenomena vs. on the other hand, applying a hypothesis to a single case (with adjustable parameters) in such a manner that those who follow can duplicate the results by repeating the same steps. The problem with climate change is that very little in this field of endeavor is``proven'' and most of the``accumulated advances in understanding of climate change'' over the past 20 years range from arbitrary (climate model results) to improper (the so-called hockey stick result).",

Oreskes (2004) built her argument in favor of anthropogenic global warming based on a list of who supports the hypothesis, rather than the scientific basis for it. She emphasized that the IPCC, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Meteorological Society, the American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)``all have issued statements in recent years concluding that the evidence for human modification of climate is compelling''. In a study of 928 abstracts published in refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, she did not``find one paper that disagreed with the consensus position.'' However, at the end, she provided an escape clause:`T he scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong. If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known . . . Many details about climate interactions are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued research to provide a better basis for understanding climate dynamics.'' Three years later, she concluded that global warming due to greenhouse gases``is an established scientific fact'' (Oreskes, 2007a). In 2007, she gave a presentation of 109 slides to the American Meteorological Society (Oreskes, 2007b). That a social scientist would have 109 slides' worth of information to convey about climate change speaks to the role of consensus as a force in science. Her first slide quoted no less an expert on climatology than Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Terminator said``the debate is over'' (pun intended). Her second slide proclaimed:``There is a scientific consensus over the reality of anthropogenic global warming.'' Here she deals with belief #5 in my previously given list of 10 beliefs relevant to consensus. She then proceeded to quote various authorities to show that a consensus exists. Unfortunately for her, she ventured briefly into the science of climate change where she got in well over her head. Using the``hockey stick'' result, she concluded that carbon dioxide as the cause of warming in the 20th century is``not just a correlation\u00d0it's a confirmation of a prediction\u00d0the scientific method''. It is not clear which scientific method she refers to\u00d0certainly none that I am aware of. Of course, the real issue is not whether anthropogenic generated CO 2 contributed to warming in the past *100 years; the real issue is what will be the consequence of further emissions in the 21st century? That is a totally different and more difficult question. I refer to Miyogi in the film The Karate Kid:``Answer only matter if ask right question.'' For the sake of argument, we might blandly accept beliefs #1 though #9 in my previously given list, but we are stuck with belief #10 with little evidence that it is true.",

Hence it is assumed that greenhouse gases made the difference between the past 120 years and the previous 2,000 years\u00d0and thus it is concluded that greenhouse gases caused the temperature rise of the past 120 years. As more than a few have put it:``What else could have caused this temperature increase?'' There are several problems with this argument. The first is most important. Do the proxies work? Do they provide accurate renditions of the global average temperature over the past 2,000 years? There is considerable evidence that proxies are affected by many more variables than temperature, and, in the important case of tree rings, this is a particular problem. In general, proxies do not seem to be anywhere as good as they are claimed to be by their proponents. The prevailing implicit belief system in the work of Mann, Bradley, Jones, et al. is that proxies provide accurate renditions of temperature change at each locality.

The belief system further assumes that, when one adds up T M for many sites, the values of T G will reinforce, but the sum of T L will add up to zero due to cancellation of + and\u00d0values. As far as this writer knows, this belief system has never been demonstrated with data. If the measurements do not accurately reflect temperature changes, this procedure will not yield T M . But if, regardless of how inaccurate the values of T M are, they tend to be roughly equally distributed about zero, the end result of adding multiple proxies will be close to zero. Figures 2.9 and 2.16 show typical assortments of proxies. It is apparent that there is a wide diversity of patterns and there is no evidence of a consistent signal buried within the noise. Paleoclimatologists have used sophisticated statistical methods to extract a trend for T G from such noisy data. However, there is no evidence for the assumption that these measurements of T M include a consistent T G plus a random distribution of T L . What seems more likely, at least for temperature changes under 18C over many centuries, is that all the data are representative of at least several factors, the signal due to temperature is inaccurate, and adding up these seemingly random patterns will always result in an almost flat profile. Figure 4 .1 shows a cartoon of how adding random patterns produces a flat profile. As the number of patterns increases, the net result approaches null. It appears to this writer that a similar effect occurred in the work of Mann, Bradley, Jones, et al. Tacking on a rising measured T G in the 20th century to a flat profile of noisy proxies for past centuries produces a hockey stick. We must ask ourselves why these various proxies are so widely divergent in form from one another. Are they (as paleoclimatologists would have you believe) true representations of local temperatures? If they are, it seems clear that local climates vary extremely widely, and there is no a priori reason to believe that they fit the T M = T G + T L paradigm. Local temperatures appear to be controlled by forces that are difficult to comprehend. It seems more likely, however, that these widely divergent results indicate that proxies are measuring something in addition to temperature. Either way, there is no reason to believe that a consistent signal for T G can be extracted from such a set of proxies. Aside from the question of whether combining multiple proxies involves mainly adding up noise, there is considerable anecdotal evidence that there have been significant fluctuations in the Earth's climate over the past 1,000 years or so.",

The argument has been phrased that the very uncertainty of future climate change dictates that we should act now to mitigate it. Whether a risk is worth insuring against depends on four things: (1) the probability of the event occurring (the uncertainty), (2) the cost if the event occurs, (3) the cost to insure against the event, and (4) the ability to pay the cost of insurance. The more uncertain a future catastrophe is, the smaller is the need to mitigate it. On the other hand, if the cost is extremely high for a low-probability event, it may still be worth insuring against. One thing is clear. If one insures, there will definitely be a cost\u00d0the cost for purchasing insurance. If one cannot afford that cost, one may be forced to forego purchasing insurance and hope for the best.

Nevertheless, reasonable estimates can be made of future CO 2 emissions for the remainder of the 21st century under several scenarios and, for scenarios in which significant fossil fuel usage persists in the 21st century, the uncertainty in estimation of emissions is not very great.",

The census bureau reports that 46.2% of Americans live below the poverty line. 7 The U.S. federal debt is now about $50,000 per man, woman, and child in America. Our expenses outweigh our incomes and we can't stop spending. Even so, many of our government programs are underfunded and in trouble. If the world stops using fossil fuels, won't it enter a depression far worse than the 1930s? If we depend on renewable energy, won't we be beset by continual outages, and won't it take so long to establish renewable energy that CO 2 will build up in the interim? And who, pray tell, is going to get China, India, and the other Asian countries to stop using fossil fuels?

As it turns out, 2008 was an unusually cold year in which much of the warming of the previous 20 years (or more) was mitigated. But, in early 2009, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) published a news release that said that``2008 was the 39th warmest year since 1895''. Of course, 1895 was a very cold baseline year. Since 1930, 39 out of 79 years were warmer than 2008\u00d0hardly a basis for alarm. Yet the NWS made it seem as if 2008 was an exceptionally hot year! Similarly, the NOAA website reports the 2009 temperature as``the nth warmest year on record out of 130 years'', where n is typically in the range 6 to 9. But the six to nine years that were warmer than 2009 all occurred since the hot year of 1998 induced by a huge El Nin\u00c4 o; hence 2009 is stacking up as a relatively cold year compared with the previous decade! In a situation where the global average temperature has obviously risen to a new level, continued mention that recent years are the sixth warmest, or the third warmest, or whatever, since records began adds absolutely nothing but alarm to the discussion. The fact is that we have been on a temperature plateau for the past 15 years and any and all of those years are among the warmest since the Little Ice Age. It is akin to the cartoon showing a mature person with height marks on the wall made while he was growing up, saying``This is one of the tallest years of my life''.",

The principal funder of the workshops project and its report was the Paleoclimate Program, Division of Atmospheric Sciences, National Science Foundation. Some financial support was also provided by grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air Programs, and limited in-kind support was provided by the National Centers for Coastal and Ocean Science (NCCOS), the scientific research arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Ocean Service (NOAA/NOS) in the U.S. Department of Commerce, and by the NASA. David Verardo, Ph.D., of the National Science Foundation, was the primary person who enabled this science/ journalism project. While this report is portrayed as an effort to promote better communication on climate change, its real intent seems to be to promote the alarmist viewpoint. For example, it begins:`C limate scientists were frustrated by what they saw as a failure of the general public to understand and appreciate the seriousness of the climate change issue [i.e., the grave dangers according to the alarmist viewpoint]. Many scientists said they were frustrated that the accumulated advances in understanding of climate change over more than two decades of research had not led to a better-informed public [i.e., the use of climate models to predict large temperature increase in the 21st century]. . . . The workshops focused in particular on what scientists call`anthropogenic climate change'\u00d0that caused by human activities and not part of a natural cycle.'' Like (``Fair and Balanced'') Fox News on TV, this report suggests:`T he preponderance of scientific evidence had since accumulated to a point where responsible reporters should give the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change much greater weight than dissenting claims challenging the mainstream scientific conclusions. The journalistic tenet of accuracy now demands that the established science be given total or near total prevalence in coverage of certain aspects of climate change science.'' (Emphasis added)",

But intelligent skeptics do not deny the greenhouse effect. They merely doubt that we can quantitatively affirm feedback effects based on present knowledge. Furthermore, there are a great many strong supporters of climate alarmism who are clearly lacking in``scientific credentials''. Naomi Oreskes, who has written articles and books and made presentations in favor of alarmism, is a prime example. In addition, the fact that a climate scientist may have done work and published papers means little in most cases. Most scientists are narrow specialists and do not have a synoptic view of the field.

Much of these data are complex, and it is difficult to resolve cause\u00b1effect relationships because of so many confusing crossfactors. Furthermore, climate data needs to be long-term, typically 100 years or more, and most direct data are far shorter. Proxies are beset with a variety of problems. In this situation, it has come to pass, that climatologists tend to draw definitive conclusions from this checkerboard of inadequate, noisy data. A subtle compact has evolved whereby climatologists accept the results of one another, regardless of how flimsy the support base might be. Members of the club preserve this outward aura of scientific rigor, which in most cases is not justified. With the Climate scientists were far more likely to use intuition (82%) over sensing (18%) than the general public, who preferred sensing (73%) vs. intuition (27%) Thinking/feeling Climate scientists were somewhat more likely to use thinking (49%) over feeling (51%) than the general public, who preferred feeling (60%) vs. thinking (40%) Judging/perceiving Climate scientists were far more likely to use judging (73%) over perceiving (27%) than the general public but were more even with judging (54%) vs. intuition (46%) advent of climate alarmism over the past couple of decades, climatologists seem to have taken on a more strident tone. Assertions today are presented as fact regardless of the technical underpinnings. This has created a great market for selling climate research, and climatologists have banded together to minimize and snuff out those who would raise the specter of``The Emperor has no Clothes''. Weiler et al. (2011) provided a very interesting insight into the personalities of climate scientists. Personality types of interdisciplinary, Ph.D. climate-change researchers were collected based on a Jungian type personality assessment (described below). Each person was characterized by four personality traits as shown in Table  4 .1. Climate researchers were compared with the general public as shown in Table  4 .2. One thing stands out. There is a huge statistical inversion between climate scientists vs. the public in that climate scientists greatly lean towards intuition whereas the public heavily leans towards sensing. This implies that the climate scientists``focus on theories'' and``follow hunches to reach conclusions'' whereas the public tends to``focus on experience'' and``build carefully and logically towards conclusions''. The strange thing is that one would expect that the very nature of the scientific method requires that scientists should focus on sensing, rather than intuition. In addition, there is also a much stronger tendency of climate scientists to prefer judging to perceiving, and there is a somewhat greater tendency of climate scientists to prefer thinking to feeling. Thus, climate scientists tend to``prefer to make decisions quickly, come to closure and move on''. This is clearly evident in the many papers in climatology that utilize a penny's worth of data to draw a dollar's worth of conclusions. In fact, one might say in a Churchillian sense: Rarely have so many drawn so many conclusions from so little reliable data. Martin (1979) wrote an interesting report in which he described the biases that inevitably creep into scientific research and reporting. According to Martin, scientists``do not disinterestedly look at the available evidence, do not make a balanced analysis, and do not present results in a neutral manner''. Instead, he suggested``from the beginning [they] support or favor a particular conclusion, and in a number of ways organize their scientific work so as to selectively support this conclusion''. He labeled this as``pushing the argument''. Martin argued that pushing scientific arguments is inevitable, and therefore pushing should not reflect unfavorably upon the competence or integrity of the scientist. He said:`T he important thing is not to eliminate pushing, which is impossible anyway, but to recognize that it exists. . . . Neither does the existence of pushing automatically imply that a scientist's results or conclusions are unjustifiable or wrong. While a scientist's argument may be judged on the basis of current understanding to be pushed, it may eventually be vindicated. Or it may not.''",

In presenting evidence one must always be selective\u00d0all the evidence and arguments cannot be presented. Often different authorities support different viewpoints, present different`facts', and offer different interpretations of evidence. Depending on the field, a scientist may draw sound support for many points of view and find some support for nearly any view. Therefore it is easy for a scientist, knowingly or unknowingly, to push an argument by selective choice and use of available evidence.'' Most of Martin's treatise was framed in terms of the debate during the early 1970s as to whether emissions from high-flying supersonic transports (SSTs) would destroy the ozone layer and thereby endanger the Earth's population by exposure to excessive radiation. For purposes of discussion, he presented detailed summaries and reviews of two prime scientific papers in the field with contrasting approaches. One paper was said to contain``the built-in assumption that the burden of proof lies with those who claim that SSTs are safe: that all that he must demonstrate is that there is at least some small possibility of danger''. By contrast, the other paper used``the [implied] assumption that the burden of proof lies with those who claim that SSTs are dangerous to ozone: that all [they needed to] demonstrate was that the likelihood of significant danger was small''.",

According to Martin:`P eople tend to selectively observe and interpret information in a way that supports their preconceived ideas. Because of this, the personal commitments of individual scientists can help to explain the link between the scientists' presuppositions and their pushing of arguments. . . . In a scientist, this process might operate as follows. The scientist starts with an original idea or hypothesis, perhaps arrived at as a creative solution to a certain problem. In testing or validating the idea, the scientist will tend to notice and use supporting evidence and arguments. Data that seems mainly supportive will be studied, analyzed and applied so that every possible advantage can be drawn from it. Seemingly irrelevant or inconclusive items will be filtered from advantageous components, or interpreted in a way that promotes the argument. Evidence that seems mainly to contradict or challenge the argument at hand may be ignored completely or explained away or reinterpreted and twisted into support for the argument.`S ome of the ways in which a person may deal with a challenging item of information are (1) flat denial of the item; (2) skepticism about the source of the item; (3) ascription of a motive to the source of the item; (4) isolation of the item from the context of one's attitude; (5) minimization of the importance of the item; (6) interpretation of the item to suit one's purpose; (7) misunderstanding of the item; and (8) thinking away or just forgetting the item.''",

If one starts with a particular weather prediction for a locality, the next update of that prediction might forecast an increase or a decrease in the predicted temperature. There is an equal probability for either outcome. However, in regard to the climate\u00b1CO 2 connection and the predicted severity of future global warming, the overwhelming majority of new published papers find that the climate\u00b1CO 2 connection is strengthened and the predicted severity of future global warming is increased. Only rarely do papers get published with opposite conclusions. Alarmists might argue that the original hypothesis of CO 2 -induced global warming becomes solidified as more data and better analyses accumulate. On the other hand, we have already demonstrated that cabals rule the review process for major journals, favoring those of the alarmist persuasion. We have also noted that the majority of published climatologists favor the alarmist position and this influences their perspectives. The alarmist position is also favorable to receiving funding for research. Michaels and Balling (2009) discussed the so-called`f ile-drawer problem'' in which`N egative results are generally considered not noteworthy. . . . Scientific journals are skewed by a prejudice for the publication of statistically significant, positive' results and prejudiced against findings of no relationship between hypothesized variables. . . .

With the advent of the Internet, the monopoly of scientific journals has been weakened. Other cultural changes have taken place. Of some relevance is the fact that scientists are now far more prone to issue press releases on their work prior to publication, and these tend to find their way onto many websites. Other scientists, disagreeing with the orthodoxy of the consensus, have difficulty getting published in the journals. A number of so-called web blogs dealing with climate change have emerged over the past several years, and these have become foci for discussions and commentary. Most blogs are rabidly one-sided and present forums for either alarmists or skeptics to agree with one another. Any moron can voice his or her opinion. Two blogs that stand out above the others are climateaudit.org, which has become a universal watchdog for reviewing statistical analysis of large data sets, and judithcurry.com, which provides an even-handed forum for both sides. The judithcurry.com blog has emerged in 2010\u00b12012 as by far the best source of new ideas in climate science analysis, with many stimulating new posts by Judith Curry. Unfortunately, the responses on these blogs have become so numerous (typically many hundreds) that the wheat often gets lost in the chaff. It is particularly disappointing to observe that a limited number of adherents clog up the responses to Judith Curry's stimulating posts with mostly irrelevant, trivial, or nonsensical entries.

However, in many cases, peer review has become subject to political correctness, and assures that only one viewpoint will be heard. Michaels There is absolutely no doubt in these articles that CO 2 emissions were the prime cause of global warming in the 20th century. The only issue discussed is how rapidly CO 2 emissions must be reduced to save the world from disaster. The approach taken by these authors is statistical. The wide swath of modeled estimates of future CO 2 emissions and future temperatures are treated as votes, and the winning candidate is the result with the greatest preponderance of ballots. The conclusion is that, to save humanity, future CO 2 emissions must be draconically reduced\u00d0a recipe guaranteed to produce much more financial hardship in the world than global warming. 15 Furthermore, most of the peer-reviewed articles in climatology are narrow, highly detailed, and represent new measurements or models. Most of the material that``circumvents peer review'' is typically interpretive, synoptic, or in the nature of a review. Relatively little of it presents fundamental new measurements or calculations. One very important role for non-peer-reviewed reports is the activity of the climateaudit.org blog that checks out many of the publications passed by peer reviews, attempts to reproduce the results (usually they cannot), and reviews these papers to put them into perspective\u00d0a task ignored by the peer-review system. The climateaudit.org blog run by Steve McIntyre performs a valuable role in checking out the details of many published papers relevant to global warming\u00d0a task not done well (and usually not at all) by peer reviews. As it turns out, McIntyre has uncovered many errors and biases in these papers, most notably the Mann, Bradley, and Hughes``hockey stick'' papers.",

McIntyre discusses the debate on this issue at some length. 16 The effect of a change in greenhouse gas concentration is expressed as an equivalent forcing at the top of the atmosphere in W/m 2 . Similarly, the feedback from cloud-cover changes is Unfortunately, as Dessler admits, this global cloud feedback data was taken``in response to short term climate fluctuations'' where``the primary source of climate variations [was] the El Nin\u00c4 o\u00b1Southern Oscillation (ENSO)''. The data suffer from two lacks: (1) the data are short-term, and (2) the data are not based on greenhouse gas warming. While Dessler derived the straight-line fit shown in the figure, indicating a weak positive feedback, it seems evident that cloud cover was not driven by Earth surface temperature at all, and varied chaotically during this short period due to unknown factors.

According to one blog entry in response to Mosher, anthropogenic global warming (AGW) proponents are justified in their alarm for the planet, but their view is that the public is always too selfish and parochial to appreciate the dire need to act. The IPCC and many climate scientists view the public as a bloc that needs to be manipulated into compliance. Thus, the IPCC manipulated the evidence to appear one-sided.

It is claimed on the Internet that Exxon funded the National Center for Policy Analysis and the Heritage Foundation to publicize anti-alarmist ideas. However, even if this were true, the amounts of funding involved ($75,000 and $50,000, respectively) were miniscule compared to the hundreds of millions doled out by government agencies to support the alarmist agenda. 19 Nature magazine 20 claimed:`T he Heartland Institute plans to spend $1.8 million on its climate programme this year. Of that, $413,000 will go to supporting the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), a small group of skeptics who have set themselves up as a counterweight to the IPCC. Made up of . . . a few dozen colleagues, the NIPCC mines the scientific literature for nuggets of contrary evidence and doubt\u00d0often the kind of uncertainties that scientists readily acknowledge in their publications. The NIPCC also ignores mountains of evidence about the adverse effects of global warming and instead strings together a confident story that makes rising carbon dioxide concentrations seem entirely beneficial.''",

If you enter``obesity and global warming'' into Google, you obtain 1,100,000 responses. Typical responses in the queue are: (1) Is obesity causing global warming? A new study has suggested that obesity is affecting the planet . . . by raising carbon emissions . . . ; (2) Do obese people aggravate global warming?\u00d0ABC News; (3) Scoop: Burning the Fat: Obesity and Global Warming, a study in the latest issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology by Phil Edwards and Ian Roberts plays out a grim scene: a world of overweight . . . ; (4) thinner is better to curb global warming, study says\u00d0CNN.com; and there are thousands more like this. Some claim the effect is through excessive use of resources, while others blame it on increased flatulence.In a February 2013 news announcement, it was revealed that a French cattle feed company (Valorex) developed a novel form of carbon credits aimed at providing incentive to farmers to stop cows from emitting climate-changing``farts''. In France, cattle account for 5% of the country's carbon output. Valorex sells a trade mix that comprises corn, soy, lupin, and linseed, which it says means cows emit 64% less methane, deliver better-quality milk, and need fewer vet visits.

(4) Environmental Protection Agency: the EPA was created to clean up the environment, and actually did a pretty good job of it; just as its reason for being was beginning to wane, along came a great deal of publicity about climate change, and the EPA adopted climate change as its reason for continued existence. I checked seven pages deep into the queue (about 70 responses) and did not find one response to a site that was not rabidly worried about extreme climate change.
