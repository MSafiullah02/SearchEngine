Every year pathogens cause nearly 14 million deaths worldwide, mostly in developing countries. More than 350 infectious diseases have emerged between the 1940s and 2004 [1]. Also among the 500 known arboviruses, only 50 are known to be human pathogens, while the others only infect wild animals and/or arthropods. To anticipate an epidemic one must identify the risk, prepare an appropriate response, and control the disease spread by first identifying the vulnerabilities of the population and circumscribing the potential space into which a disease will extend. When the epidemic expansion risk is identified, adequate information must be communicated to decision makers. Ultimately, an appropriate response will depend on biosurveillance, prevention, sustained data processing, communication, strategic immunization campaigns, resilience, and mitigation strategies.",

The concept of an epidemic, as a disease affecting many persons at the same time and spreading from person to person in a locality where the disease was not previously prevalent, was not enunciated until 1854 when John Snow produced his admirable demonstration of the emergence of an infectious disease in an urban area: the emergence of a cholera epidemic in London. At that time, none could clearly comprehend the mechanisms of emergence and spread since the existence of microbes had just been demonstrated by Louis Pasteur in the late 1830s and microbe transmission modes were more speculative than based on medical or scientific facts, until 1876 when Robert Koch demonstrated that bacteria can be transmitted and responsible for diseases. Nowadays, it is extremely difficult to make a retrospective diagnosis of historical pandemics, during times when clinical descriptions were rare or lacking accuracy, and the extent of an epidemic was extremely subjective. Thus, it is common to note that the first outbreak described in the Western World was that of the plague of Athens for which Thucydides rather precisely reported the symptoms; today this epidemic has often been attributed to typhus through its clinical picture and epidemic profile [4].",

Indeed, the rise of a \u201cnew\u201d virus is an extremely rare event. Most often, in terms of pathogen emergence, a virus adapts through mutation and selection pressure to a human host causing disease. Presumably, smallpox, measles, and influenza were among the plagues that struck the ancient Latins in gusts of epidemics more or less severe. The Antonin plague that extended from 167 to 172 AD in much of Western Europe, when the troops of Emperor Lucius Verus returned from war against the Parthians, is often attributed to a smallpox pandemic by historians. In the Middle Ages, it seems that smallpox made a return around 541 AD to France, Germany, Belgium, and the British Islands [5]. The acute respiratory infections reported during the winter of 876\u2013877 AD accompanying the return of the Carolingian armies from Italy have been attributed by historians to a flu epidemic. Many soldiers of Charlemagne died then. The disease returned regularly and fiercely in 927 and 1105 AD to the western European peninsula [6, 7] (Table 2).\n",

            "text": "From the plague (sensu\nlato, including all transmissible diseases) of antiquity, to the severe acute respiratory syndrome that emerged on the eve of the third millennium, pandemics have followed in the history of mankind. As noted by Mirko Grmek, a historian of medicine, it seems that one pandemic will drive in another. If several diseases circulate concomitantly, one of them will take precedence over the other, an epidemic over the previous, and it is more likely that a pandemic will prevail [8]. Plague temporarily replaced the leprosy that appeared in Eurasia for over 50,000 years; during the first millennium, plague was manifested by successive pandemics that crossed continents. During the first half of the past millennium, syphilis started its expansions, crossed oceans, and became global. Tuberculosis originated in Europe more than 15,000 years ago, but it was only at the turn of the seventeenth century that it was considered a pandemic; smallpox was also manifest as epidemics and then was pandemic at its peak in the late nineteenth century, then smallpox persisted until the Jenner area. Although early medical records of smallpox are available (Egypt, China, India), large and devastating epidemics were only identified in the late fifteenth century of the millennium. Smallpox was introduced into the Americas by Spanish settlers in the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1492 and arrived in Mexico in 1509. On Hispaniola Island, one third of a million of the inhabitants died of smallpox in the following 20 years. Smallpox devastated the native Amerindian population and was an important factor in the conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas by the Spaniards [9]. In 1545, 8000 children died in Goa, India, from a smallpox epidemic. In Europe, smallpox was a leading cause of death in the eighteenth century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year [10]. During the twentieth century, it is estimated that smallpox was responsible for 300\u2013500 million deaths. The last known natural case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977 [11].",

All these dynamics are essential for an effective disease transmission and spread. An outbreak is a sudden increase in occurrences of a disease in a particular time and place, more localized than an epidemic. An epidemic occurs as the disease spreads to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. To spark an epidemic chain of transmission depends on factors like immune population density, virus infectiousness, promiscuity, vulnerability, etc., while the efficiency of such transmission depends on how many persons will be infected by one person (i.e., the reproductive ratio or R0 ). An epidemic event will therefore expand in space (beyond the first cluster of cases) and time (rapid spread). A pandemic is essentially spatial, and represents an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread through human populations across a large region, extensively across two or more continents, to worldwide. However, all these typologies harbor the same fundamentals: emergence from one index case, transmission from one host to another, and spatial expansion. Altogether, an epidemic and a pandemic are respectively a local and a global network of interconnected infectious disease outbreaks (i.e., epidemic chains). Ultimately, understanding how disease (i.e., pathogens) spread in the social system is fundamental in order to prevent and control outbreaks, with broad implications for a functioning health system and its associated costs [15]. Also, after the last case occurs at the end of an epidemic, the goal is to control the risk of transmission for a 21-day time period. This three-week period represents an incubation when the infected subject does not transmit the virus and remains asymptomatic. The \u201c21 days\u201d is based on experimental methods use in virology to detect virus replication: Influenza virus infected eggs should hatch in 21 days, there is a 21-day limit for an arbovirus to infect a living model (suckling mice, mice, rats, guinea pigs, cell lines). Moreover, most viral infectious diseases have a maximal incubation period of 21 days , with few exceptions (e.g., HIV, and rabies). Ultimately, such 21-day periods multiplied by the potential of a carrier to travel will produce the risk area for the emergence of secondary cases (from a walking distance to the long distances covered by commercial jets). However, it is important to clarify that many VHF including Ebola virus can be carried by an asymptomatic host for several months [16, 17].",

It is extremely helpful when a disease emerges to rapidly surmise the mode of transmission and how to respond (e.g., water-borne disease, arthropod-borne disease, human-to-human transmission). Pathogen transmission can be interspecific or hetero-specific, direct or indirect. Direct transmission occurs by close contact with infected biological products (e.g., blood, urine, saliva). Indirect transmission occurs with intermediate hosts such as arthropod vectors (e.g., mosquito, tick) or mammalian vector/reservoir (e.g., rodent, chiropteran) or from infected environmental means (e.g., soil, water, etc.). Mobility and transportation are the main factors for diseases dispersion, as an emblematic example, one can simply show how the 2013\u20132016 EVD outbreak of Western Africa expanded due to the transportation of patients during their 21-day incubation periods, first by foot-paths, then by motorbike, then taxis and public transportation, finally becoming a global concern with patients traveling by boat or commercial airline [18, 19].",

Environmental factors can also be major drivers of pathogen expansion, for example the emergence of Nipah encephalitis. The Nipah virus, when it emerged for the first time in Malaysia in 1998, was transported by its natural host, a frugivorous chiropteran. A year earlier, an immense forest fire affecting several Indonesian islands had forced the escape of disease-carrying bats that took refuge in Malaysian orchards, planted to nurture newly developed pig farms. Both pigs and farmers became infected and Nipah virus was discovered for the first time. Another classical example, more associated with human environment and behavior, is the old story of the spread of dengue virus via the used tires carrying infected eggs and transporting dengue across oceans and continents [20].",

Finally, while an epidemic pattern is driven intrinsically by the virus and its vector, the host population, the mode of transmission, and even the human environment (e.g., population density, urbanization, agricultural practices, health system, public health policies) as well as physical environment (season, meteorology, climate changing, latitude, altitude) factor into the rate of disease spread.",

Altogether these intrinsic factors link to the infectivity of the virus, indeed, viruses transmitted by aerosol possess certainly the most efficient way to spark an epidemic that increases with population density and vulnerability as well as with the resistance of the virus to environmental factors outside the host cells.",

Mobility of hosts/vectors that are part of the natural cycle will also play a role in the potential for disease expansion (e.g., mosquito-flying distance, cattle transhumance, human migration). Also, other factors associated with the hosts will render a more efficient transmission: human behaviors like fear/social responses, nosocomial infections, super-spreaders); viruses having multiple natural hosts (vicariates) or vectors; vectors with multiple trophic preferences (e.g., biting cattle, birds, and primates); the incubation period in the vertebrate hosts as well as the intrinsic replication in the arthropod vectors will also intervene; ultimately subclinical infection is also an underestimated factor of virus dispersion and transmission that modifies the epidemiological pattern of disease.",

VHF are exemplary for their epidemic patterns of expansion dependent on the above reviewed factors (i.e., fundamentals of emergence) and their epidemiological characteristics (i.e., virus, host, environments). For example, let us consider the control of arenavirus spread by their strong host-species association. On a geological time scale, arenaviruses such as the agent for Argentinian hemorrhagic fever (AHF ) coevolved with their natural rodent host and then spread according to the expansion of the rodent host. One host\u2013one virus ultimately produces a localized endemic cycle, the distribution of the disease overlaps the distribution of the rodent host while enzootic patterns appear naturally limited to an ecosystem (e.g., local rodent populations, behaviors, and environmental factors). Hantaviruses also appear as a global complex, resulting from the coevolution of virus and rodent hosts and a global dispersion of generally localized enzootic diseases [22\u201324]. As for the pandemic risk associated with a natural virus reservoir, chiropterans are unique flying and migratory mammals that have been associated with filoviruses and other viruses of major public health importance [25], their potential as vectors will eventually favor the spread of these viruses into new territories. Also because there is potential for a long coevolution, epidemiological patterns are also dependent on virus-host spillover, host vicariate, and other environmental factors (e.g., climate change and man-made changes in land use). Other arboviruses such as yellow fever virus , dengue virus , as well as West Nile , chikungunya, or Zika viruses show a pandemic risk associated with the existing distribution of their respective arthropod vector, vector density, and ability to transmit virus.",

Each of these HFV shares some common features that define the nosology of the VHF group, from virus structures to the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of their diseases.HFV are RNA viruses with envelope proteins embedded in a lipid bilayer, they are dependent on their animal and/or insect hosts for survival, and their geographical spread overlaps the areas where their natural hosts live.HFV spread person-to-person through direct contact with symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, body fluids, or cadavers.VHF can have a zoonotic origin, as when humans have contact with infected livestock via slaughter or consumption of raw meat, unpasteurized milk, bushmeat, inhalation or contact with materials contaminated with excreta from rodents or bats.HFV can be vector-borne, i.e., transmitted via rodents, mosquitos, and ticks.VHF are zoonotic diseases . Accidental transmission from the natural host to humans can eventually lead to human-to-human transmission, human infection, and sporadic outbreaks.With a few noteworthy exceptions (i.e., ribavirin ), there is no cure or established drug treatment for VHF , while limited vaccines could be available, including YF, AHF , and RVF (the latter is for animals only).VHF have common features: they affect many organs, they damage blood vessels, and they affect the body\u2019s ability to regulate itself. Clinical case definitions describe VHF with at least two of the following clinical signs: hemorrhagic or purpuric rash; epistaxis, hematemesis, hemoptysis, melena, among other hemorrhagic symptoms without known predisposing host factors for hemorrhagic manifestations. In fact, during an epidemic, all infected patients do not show these signs and a specific case definition needs to be defined in accordance with the suspected or proven viral etiology of the disease [28]. Also, VHF pathogenesis encompasses a variety of mechanisms including: (1) alteration of hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors, cytokine storm, increased vascular permeability, complement activation, disseminated intravascular coagulation. Moreover, severe pathogenic syndrome is often supported by an ineffective immunity, high viral loads, and severe plasma leakage and co-infection with other pathogens [29].\n",

In the seventeenth century, it spread to South America through the \u201ctriangular\u201d slave trade, after which several major outbreaks occurred in the Americas, Africa, and Europe [30, 31]. The yellow fever vaccine is a fantastic gift from pioneering vaccinology; it is efficient, affordable for developing countries, and protects for at least a decade or even life-long. However, YF remains a particular concern at the global level and the number of cases has unexpectedly increased this past decade. Nowadays, YFV causes 200,000 infections and 30,000 deaths every year, with nearly 90% occurring in Africa. Nearly a billion people live in an endemic area [32]. Although YFV is common in tropical areas of South America and Africa, it has never been isolated in Asia [33]. Ultimately, the pandemic risk is there, from the uncontrolled epidemic as for example in the inland remote area of the Brazilian Mato Grosso state, to the recent burst of epidemics in West and Central Africa including Angola, DRC, as well as imported cases in Kenya and China [34, 35]. Indeed, the risk of a pandemic exists if any imported case goes to an area where the fundamentals of emergence are present (i.e., and a nonimmune human population). For years it has been stressed that YF coverage needs to be exhaustive in the endemic area, and the WHO international health regulations (IHR) need to be strictly respected when peoples are crossing frontiers to or from an endemic area [36].",

Dengue virus (DENV) expansion was followed by the emergence of a DHF pandemic that occurred in the late twentieth century (see above, the \u201ctire- mosquito larvae connection\u201d). By the end of the century, DHF emerged in the Pacific and the Americas, and extended to all Asian continents [32]. Lately, in the 1980s, epidemic dengue fever occurs in Africa, with a predominant activity in East Africa, while sylvatic DENV circulation was described in Western Africa [39]. The different dengue virus serotypes spread also independently to all continents. While it is remarkable that infection with one serotype does not provide cross-protective immunity against the others, epidemics caused by multiple serotypes became more frequent, and highly pathogenic DENV were identified [40]. Dengue fever to date has a global distribution with an estimated 2.5 billion people at risk. Yearly, hundreds of thousands of DHF cases occur [32]. Altogether, the requirements for a DHF pandemic are globally present [41]: the highly competent and DENV vectors, the globally distributed DENV serotypes and highly pathogenic strains, and finally, climate change that opens new breeding opportunities for these mosquitoes to expand and eventually transmit imported DENV into new populations and territories [42].

It took 43 years to effectively connect Marburg virus, MARV, to a bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, as a natural MARV reservoir in Central Africa [44]. MARV is considered to be extremely dangerous for humans, is classified as a Risk Group 4 Pathogen, and also is listed as a Select Agent; however, the pandemic risk cannot be assessed because only four epidemics have occurred. Although MARV expansion appears to be limited to a few countries in Africa, the recent emergence (estimated at a few decades ago) of a second human pathogenic marburgvirus known as Ravn virus, and the widely distributed Old World rousette fruit bats (Rousettus spp.) serving as reservoir for both viruses [45], are two factors that favor pandemic risk.",

The EVD epidemic went from outbreak to pandemic risk. Like Marburg virus, another member of the Filoviridae, Ebola virus, shares bats as a potential virus reservoir, human and nonhuman primates are highly sensitive to the virus, and inter-epidemic periods play an important role since the epidemic silences tend to diminish the attention of health services and increase epidemic risk. In this way, the first Western African EVD epidemic is exemplary for showing the hidden risks contained in the natural cycle of a virus, and the sudden emergence followed by an unprecedented velocity of spreading.

Ultimately, after an early suspicion of the presence of the Hantaviruses in Africa [51], a novel hantavirus, Sangassou virus, was isolated in 2012 in Guinea [52].

De facto, the distribution of the virus covers that of its natural hosts but is isolated in an ecosystem generally limited by natural barriers, e.g., mountains, river. A phenomenon in which rodent lineages are naturally infected by a virus and remain in such a limited environment is called \u201cnidality\u201d [54]. This is what it is observed for Argentinian HF, Venezuelan HF, Bolivian HF, and Lassa HF. Regarding the pandemic risk of any of these HF, arenaviruses because of their strict association with their natural hosts, like the hantaviruses, have their expansion potential limited by their natural hosts even though the latter are widely spread and could certainly be infected. Such risk lies in an unexpected encounter between infected and noninfected populations under the pressures of (as yet unknown) factors that favor their migration from enzootic to non-enzootic areas.

It is often known only in terms of probabilities, sometimes very low and therefore often subject to significant random variability in time and space. We often seek to evaluate the spatial and temporal differences of this probability, trying to measure its significance. Sometimes, it only uses one character necessary to the presence of the pathogen or vector (e.g., the presence of water, a minimum temperature, a type of vegetation).The susceptibility of the host (which is essentially linked to individual characters, genetic, biological, such as immune status or age) is individual, and often given by a probability.Direct exposure of the host to the hazard is an element of active vulnerability, depending on the behavior of the host that increases the likelihood of contact between host and hazard by exposing it to an environment conducive to his presence (e.g., travel and contacts, professional activities). It also includes all the known \u201crisk\u201d behaviors that increase the likelihood of direct exposure to the hazard.Passive vulnerability of the host, which is not directly dependent on the pathology, is not even necessary nor sufficient for pathology, but influences the exposure of the host to the hazard or to protection from the pathology. This protection consists of prophylaxis, access to care, availability of care. It is independent of the real presence of the hazard; the host can be vulnerable without being exposed to the threat. The vulnerability is often defined by several levels (individual, context). It is very often \u201cspatial\u201d as linked to phenomena of segregation or spatial concentration.

It is estimated that, as of September of 2016, the World Wide Web reached 5.02 billion pages containing eight zettabytes of accessible data, and the accumulation of information is growing around 40% every year [66]. This situation has generated much discussion about how to use the unprecedented availability of information and computational resources and the sophistication of new analytic and visualization algorithms for decision-making to reduce the impact of infectious diseases. In fact, it is argued that the paradigm of \u201cBig Data\u201d will change not only the way business and research is done, but significantly improve the understanding of factors leading to the emergence of infectious diseases. Big Data could lead to the implementation of a decentralized biosurveillance enterprise allowing organizations and individuals to take full advantage of a large collection of disparate, unstructured qualitative, and quantitative datasets. With the proper integration and the right analytics, Big Data could find unusual data trends leading to better pathogen detection systems, as well as therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures. However, the impact of these analyses and forecasts depends not only on how the data is collected, ingested, disambiguated and processed, but also on how it is relayed in different operational contexts to users with different backgrounds and understandings of technology. While impressive in data mining capabilities, real-time content analysis of social media data misses much of the factual complexity. Quality issues within freeform user-provided hashtags and biased referencing can significantly undermine our confidence in the information obtained to make critical decisions about the natural versus intentional emergence of a pathogen.",

Therefore, public health analysts are confronted with the task to identify the likely, and unlikely, consequences and alternative critical outcomes of a given VHF outbreak. This requires the ability to monitor in near real time the dynamics of the geographical dissemination of these viruses in villages, cities, countries, continents, or the globe using new analytical techniques within the emerging field of genomic-based biosurveillance. This concept integrates microbial genotyping, next generation sequencing, metagenomics, big data and database analytics, and contextualized visualization to identify, characterize, and attribute known and unknown pathogens and generate estimates of how different contingencies will affect their impact [67]. A genomic-based biosurveillance system includes powerful microbial genomic characterization to rapidly identify a pathogen [67]. This characteristic makes a genomic-based biosurveillance a useful approach not only for public health but serves as a deterrence tool for intentional biological weapon development and deployment. The initial step consists of integration of signals generated by molecular-based assays and next generation DNA sequencing and unbiased microbial characterization for pathogen source tracing, attribution and forensics. While each of these techniques has been discussed in the literature in detail [68], the integration of this information can yield a more extended view of the scale of a pathogen outbreak. The development of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies (i.e., DNA and cDNA forms of RNA viral genomes) is allowing the genomic characterization of previously unknown pathogens without relying on prior reference molecular information [69, 70]. This information is available within days, and even hours, of sample collection, and well before the development of animal infection models. Because of their portability, this technology will become widely used in the next 5 years in routine clinical settings. However, to be clinically and epidemiologically relevant, DNA sequences must be rapidly and effectively translated into actionable information defining pathogen characteristics (i.e., virulence or drug resistance), it must point to a source of origin, and discriminate a natural event from a manmade release [71]. While some government agencies are considering use of genomic information to develop next generation Level-0 and Level-1 detection/surveillance devices [72, 73], there is no reference database where researchers can retrieve standardized genomic signatures and motif fingerprints to develop primer-, probe-, and antibody-based detection technology using reference moieties. The impact of genomic-based biosurveillance in public health and biodefense will not be fully realized until addressing the current impracticality of transferring the terabytes of genomic data generated by DNA sequencing devices to a centralized architecture performing analysis operations, as that might take hours or even days. Therefore, a new paradigm could emerge from encouraging the development of decentralized algorithms that first determine in situ the presence of pathogen-specific genomic signatures or motif fingerprints, summarize and relay the results into an operational biosurveillance metadata format for contextualized decision support.",

These are computer systems that manage large volumes of data and easily use the location to perform spatial analysis.

These are for the most part complex applications with enormous features. The \u201cGIS\u201d designation covers a wide variety of software projects built according to different technical options, functionality, and diverse performances. A GIS is essentially a management tool (structure, organization, entry, storage), an analytical tool (statistical and geographical treatment, spatial analysis), and a communication tool (data visualization, descriptive mapping, thematic mapping, atlas). It is also a tool that allows the use of a spatial model for the simulation of a process, such as the development of an epidemic. GIS facilitates the interface between modeling and simulation program, and the geographic database, and can ultimately take over the whole of access to spatial information needed by the modeling program. The GIS should thus be at the heart of organizing the collection and processing of monitoring data. To ensure the management of this system, it is important to set up a body specifying all the collection, validation, processing and dissemination of information and results (alerts, risk modeling, near real-time dissemination of results). This body must be proposed and validated by political authorities, preemptively, to avoid further blockage and to ensure effectiveness in situations of epidemic crisis.",

Spatial-temporal modeling of health events can be seen as the final stage of the analysis. It is different from statistical modeling. Despite using risk factors, it considers the epidemic phenomenon as a whole, taking into account the spatial relationships between agents (hosts, vectors, reservoirs, and pathogens), between individuals, and relationships between individuals and their environment. This model is thus useful for understanding and anticipating the epidemics, and can be generally used to classify individuals in different states (susceptible, infected, sick healed, immune) and to model the major phenomena that can change the state of an individual. However, when a model takes into account many phenomena, it can quickly become very complex. The vast majority of models are simplifications of assumed reality. Two broad categories of methods are usually developed in modeling:A deterministic approach, based on differential equations whose coefficients are adjusted from observed data, or monitoring data from epidemics. In this model, one can introduce stochastic types of components in the coefficients, studying the variability of observed data. Taking no account of spatial relationships is difficult in these models, which deal in general populations, not individuals.A nondeterministic approach, which is based on agents whose behavior is described by expertly determined rules (multi-agent models). The status of each agent is calculated at each time step, from its behavior, environment, and relations between the agent and all other agents. These models take into account a more realistic description of the phenomenon, near the complex system finely describing reality. They allow us to consider spatial relationships in each time step. These models require intensive calculation, and their use is made possible by development of the power of computer calculations.\n",

Certainly, we are not \u201cglobally\u201d prepared, unfortunately, at that scale, the immense natural and human disparities do not permit it, but we do our best in our own societies. The concept of disease emergence, born only at the end of the twentieth century, is a societal marker, our desire to be on alert, understand and predict epidemics. Ultimately, there are a few, but necessary and difficult goals to reach for the prevention and control of any epidemic, also these goals are part of the development of our societies, as well as for education, they become part of the well-being for all: First, beyond understanding transmission, is needed a clear understanding of the epidemiological pattern and the spread of a given disease, before it is too late; then, which is certainly one of the more complex and costly things to achieve, is having an efficient health system to respond to an epidemic and an operational network to respond at the regional and global levels; and last but certainly not a least, having identified funding for any public health emergency will be crucial to changing our world. Perhaps, in a shrinking global community, after too many Ebola virus disease outbreaks, we will learn and be prepared for future epidemic challenges?
