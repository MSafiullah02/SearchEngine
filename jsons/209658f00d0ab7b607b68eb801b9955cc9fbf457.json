We also fully endorse the efforts taken at every level of the health care system (hospital, local health authority, provincial department of health, federal health ministry) to prepare for the potential surge in patients with COVID-19 and any clinical needs that may come as a result. Unfortunately, few have been able to estimate accurately the extent to which COVID-19 will affect the population of Canada in terms of rates of incidence, duration, and recovery. Even less is known about how the impact of COVID-19 will vary from hospital to hospital and from province to province. Amid all this uncertainty, cardiac surgeons from across the 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46   47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89 country are being required to scale back their clinical practices in anticipation of an eventual scarcity of resources, including shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE); surgical drapes; mechanical ventilators; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits; and, ultimately, health care personnel. Despite this, cardiac surgeons nowdmore than ever beforedhave an incredibly valuable role to play during these challenging times. The CSCS believes that it is imperative that cardiac surgeons maintain an active leadership role on health care teams during this pandemic and contribute their skill sets, both within and outside their traditional scopes of practice. To this effect, the CSCS has proposed the following guiding statements in an effort to guide cardiac surgeons over the short term, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold:",

            "text": "1. Cardiac surgeons should be actively engaged in the emergency response teams of their respective institutions during the pandemic response. 2. The first priority of the cardiac surgery team is to ensure that the cardiac surgery needs of the hospital, the health region, anddin certain instancesdthe province, are met within the context of the COVID-19 burden within their jurisdictions. However, cardiac surgeons, in this time of need, should also be willing to take on additional responsibilities, includingdbut not limited todperforming noncardiac surgery, caring for nonsurgical cardiovascular patients, and caring for critically ill patients irrespective of their COVID-19 status. rates of infection among provinces and territories. 3 Amid concerns over growing resource constraints, cardiac surgeons from across Canada have been forced to make drastic changes to their clinical practices. From prioritizing and delaying elective cases to altering therapeutic strategies in high-risk patients, cardiac surgeons, along with their heart teams, are having to reconsider how best to manage their patients. It is with this in mind that the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons (CSCS) and its Board of Directors have come together to formulate a series of guiding statements. With strong representation from across the country and the support of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the authors have attempted to provide guidance to their colleagues on the subjects of leadership roles that cardiac surgeons may assume during this pandemic: patient assessment and triage, risk reduction, and real-time sharing of expertise and experiences. A visual abstract of the main principles underlying our recommended approach is provided in Figure 1 . 91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99  100  101  102  103  104  105  106  107  108  109  110  111  112  113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136   137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162  163  164  165  166  167  168  169  170  171  172  173  174  175  176  177  178 179 180 181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226   227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264  265  266  267  268  269 and critical care colleagues to evaluate resource availability to ensure the appropriate utilization of potentially scarce resources includingdbut not limited todward and intensive care unit beds, ventilators, ECMO circuits, operating rooms, equipment, drapes, PPE, medications, blood products, and health care personnel. 4. Cardiac surgeons should triage patients that are in hospital or on the elective wait list in a manner that is based not only on the patient's clinical status and risk-factor profile but also on the extent to which services are available or have been reduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 2 ). This is a strategy similar to the one recently adopted by the Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology (CAIC). 4 Undoubtedly, there is concern that the proposed prioritization strategy will result in a surgical delay and may put patients at significantly increased risk. As such, it is critically important that cardiac surgeons ensure the presence of a robust wait-times database at their institutions that captures rates of adverse events in these patients while on the wait list so that decisions around the reallocation of resources may be made in a timely fashion. 5. Cardiac surgeons should advocate for a continued role for the heart-team model to solicit the input of clinical cardiology, interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, and critical care in determining the optimal intervention for patients: in particular, those who cases are complex or who are at high risk. 6. In an effort to minimize risk to patients, cardiac surgeons should employ virtual clinicsdusing either a secure form of teleconferencing or videoconferencingdto assess patients from home who are either new referrals, postoperative follow-ups, or currently on the wait list. Similar technology may be used, if available, to assess inpatients from other institutions to avoid potentially unnecessary hospital-to-hospital transfers. 7. When it is feasible, cardiac surgical programs should make every effort to maintain areas within their institutions for cardiac surgery patients that are completely separate from patients with COVID-19, given the vulnerability of the average cardiac surgery patient (increased biological age and cardiovascular risk factors) were they to become infected with COVID-19. 8. Nonemergent cardiac surgical interventions for patients suffering from acute viral infections (such asdbut not limited todCOVID-19) are largely discouraged, based on the belief that this could significantly elevate the risk of postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality in that setting. 5 In the event that a cardiac surgical procedure is performed on presumed or confirmed COVID-19epositive patients, cardiac surgeons must be closely engaged with their hospital administrations and infection control personnel to ensure the safety of the health care team. 9. Cardiac surgeons should take the necessary steps (eg, donning and doffing PPE), as mandated by their institution and their local health authorities, to ensure their own health and well-being as well as the health and wellbeing of the members of the health care teams that they work with.",
