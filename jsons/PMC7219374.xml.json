The focus on age stems in part from the utilitarian assumptions that anchor prevailing methods of health economic evaluation [17,18]. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) have played a dominant role in assessing the value of health interventions, as a universal metric for comparisons of benefit among different technologies that incorporate quantity and quality of life into a unified indicator. Closely allied to the use of QALYs as an outcome measure in applied health economic evaluation is the assumption of utilitarian QALY maximization as a normative goal \u2013 and thus decision-criterion \u2013 when selecting the best alternative among competing interventions [19].",

Moral philosophers and social choice theorists have challenged the moral legitimacy of purely consequentialist approaches to health care rationing, including QALY maximization, citing the relevance of ethical concepts ranging from distributive justice, priority to the worst off, and rights-based entitlements in health resource allocation [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]]. Empirical studies of public preferences for health care resource allocation often employ recipient age as a proxy for QALY gains. Studies of public preferences have yielded considerable evidence favouring priority to younger populations [[13], [14], [15], [16]]. Such studies have often compared adults of various ages; select studies include a childhood age range among their comparators [15,30,31,32,33]. However, few studies have explored public preferences for health resource allocation decisions related to children as such. Moreover, the reasons underlying societal preference for the young remain incompletely understood. Crucial questions persist: Does QALY maximization drive precedence to the young or is it independent of life years gained? Are there other normative considerations at play? How do different moral ideas guide age-based prioritization by study participants? Are there specific values that inform allocative decision-making about children?",

Anand and Wailoo demonstrate weak societal preference for consequentialist rationing rules, including QALY maximization, through experimental rationing decisions that force trade-offs between hypothetical adult recipients of different ages [17]. Notably, they also empirically examine the relevance of deontological considerations in health care rationing, including personal responsibility for one\u2019s health state, socioeconomic status, and procedural considerations in priority setting. Their work demonstrates a disavowal by participants of pure QALY maximization, and highlights other salient normative considerations for potential incorporation into rationing exercises, including equality of treatment, individual rights and duties, and procedural fairness [17,36]. Relatedly, a limited body of evidence points to the impact of embedded moral reasoning on attenuated public preference for the young, suggesting that deliberation on a range of ethical principles can influence stated preferences for allocating resources based on age [10]. However, this evidence pertains to age variations amongst adults.",

This lack of evidence has contributed to a vacuum of both theoretical and context-specific knowledge about societal preferences related to the prioritization of health system resources for children. The need for more and better knowledge of public values attached to health care priority-setting affecting children is underscored by inherent challenges associated with the assessment of child health technologies [[38], [39], [40]]. Health system funding decisions for children are often constrained by limited evidence for the clinical efficacy or economic efficiency of child health technologies [41]. Childhood diseases are typically rare, the conduct of research in pediatric populations is complex, and standard metrics of clinical and economic assessment fail to incorporate unique dimensions of childhood, such as family context and life-course impacts [1,42]. Greater uncertainty in clinical and economic domains may confer greater importance on public values in decisions about the prioritization of child health technologies. In addition, evidence of differences in public preferences for health resource allocation across the life course could strengthen standard approaches to the economic evaluation of health care technologies and services through enhanced incorporation of public values.",

A limitation of non-probability sampling is the absence of general statistical theory to predict sample representativeness from survey design assumptions [49]. To minimize sampling bias and maximize the potential for national population representativeness, we employed interlocking quotas for stratified sampling (age, gender and region), balanced against Statistics Canada norms, and evaluated the composition of our final sample in comparison to the Canadian population on a range of sociodemographic characteristics.

Iterative refinements to the survey were informed by a pilot phase with experts (n = 3) and laypersons (n = 2) and field testing with members of the public (n = 32). The final survey questionnaire directed respondents to assign numerical preference scores for the allocation of resources in different health care scenarios based on age-related criteria. It presented each participant with the same five hypothetical treatment scenarios (chronic blood disease, liver transplant, cancer therapy, palliative care, and eating disorder); these scenarios were intended to provide variation in disease characteristics such as acuity, morbidity, mortality, potential for cure, and nature of treatment (Fig. 1\n; see Supplementary File eFig. 2 for full reproduction of scenarios). Participants chose between funding for treatment among adult (average age 40) and child (average age 10) patients, from the perspective of a citizen advisor to a health system administrator. Preferences were captured as continuous variables on a visual analog scale (VAS) from -5 (full preference for children) to +5 (full preference for adults), with zero representing neutrality. We employed a VAS design to explore changes in the strength of participant preferences for children or adults in order to capture more subtle variation in preference than would have been possible with categorical choices, while still allowing for preference neutrality.

This explanation is supported by theories of rational decision-making from the field of cognitive psychology that posit dual-process thinking, distinguishing intuition from reasoning [[51], [52], [53]]. The design of our study \u2013 including the survey format and pacing, question framing, and lay sample \u2013 may have induced intuitive responses from some participants, in the face of complex moral problems characterized by inherent uncertainty. In particular, participants may have allowed more obvious differentiators, such as discrepant benefits in length of life, to intuitively shape their preferences, rather than take the time and cognitive effort to work through conflicting moral choices in a rule-bound manner. This is likely particularly true of those unexposed to the moral reasoning intervention, and might explain why preference score differences between the intervention and control groups were largest in respect of cancer therapy and eating disorders treatment. It may also explain why variance in preference scores narrowed consistently across scenarios in the intervention group as compared to the control group: it is possible that this reduction in variance represents a reduction in choice uncertainty, in the context of enhanced participant reliance on analytical reasoning induced by the study intervention.",

Conversely, participants may have found it difficult to resolve competing moral intuitions through reasoned deliberation, particularly in the scripted and time-bound context of a survey.

In relation to the survey instrument, the brief statements used to evoke the meaning of each principle may have failed to capture its ethical nuances. Different framing of the principles may have led to different patterns of preference among participants; however, randomly varying the sequence of principles mitigated any ordering effect bias [60,61]. Use of a continuous scale overlapping zero to measure the strength of allocative preferences in the context of a binary choice task (fund either intervention A or B) may have led some participants to misinterpret zero as a choice to allocate equal sums of money to each population, rather than agnosticism about which intervention to fund. We sought to mitigate this potential limitation through simple, explicit scenario instructions; however, it is possible that misapprehension of the \u2018neutrality of preference\u2019 state by some participants impacted our results. The study was not designed to measure the time it took to read the principles in the moral reasoning intervention separately from completing the choice tasks. This could have given a proxy sense of whether participants read and engaged with the ethical ideas and choices involved. The assembly and composition of our study sample may have also limited the external validity of our results. Values endorsed by the Canadian public may not reflect those of other polities. The use of covariate-adaptive randomization to form balanced treatment groups with respect to relevant covariates has both benefits and inherent shortcomings; use of stratified randomization may have permitted some selection bias and only balanced a limited number of potentially relevant covariates [62]. More specifically, the survey firm generated cohorts from an opt-in panel of eligible Canadians recruited and incentivized through brand loyalty points programs. Some of the inherent selection bias associated with online opt-in panels was evident, privileging those with higher education who are web literate. However, the lack of statistically significant impacts of education and income on preference scores in the multivariate model attenuates theoretical concerns about sociodemographic bias.",

Dominant modes of health economic evaluation privilege interventions that maximize aggregate individual and societal utility, typically in the form of the duration and magnitude of benefits reaped and the size of the population reached. Our results demonstrate a stronger preference for children in the hypothetical scenarios (cancer and eating disorders) in which the duration of benefit accrued mainly to children; this may represent an underlying motivation by participants to maximize benefits. However, we also observed a strong inclination for equality and humanitarianism amongst study participants, regardless of experimental group. The three principles deemed most salient to priority-setting were equal treatment, relief of suffering, and rule of rescue. None of these prioritizes age as a relevant variable; each starts from a belief in the intrinsic value of all human life, and resists grading that value by social context or circumstance. Our results, therefore, suggest the need to incorporate other values into health care priority-setting, as some value frameworks for funding decisions have begun to do [63]. The salience of these findings to priority-setting efforts in the context of public health emergencies \u2013 including access to scarce ventilators or drugs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 is readily apparent. They furnish empirical evidence for the adjudication and refinement of ethical frameworks for triage and resource allocation during the pandemic based on public values in Canada [64,65]. Efforts to incorporate a broader range of public values and preferences in health and social policy decisions also involve inherent risks. Among them is the need to confront and grapple with public attitudes that conflict with the fundamental normative or legal principles that structure most democratic societies, including basic commitments to the protection of individual rights and nondiscrimination [66]. Future research to explore this tension and ways to resolve or address it is warranted.",

This includes the potential value of deliberative public engagement to health policymaking, particularly in domains where distinct ideas about the public good may compete. Specific to children, few efforts to incorporate public deliberation in research and policy on child health and social policy priorities have prevailed to date. In the face of resource scarcity, evidence-informed child health and social policies will depend on the careful elicitation and integration of public values. This and allied work bear potential relevance in social policy domains beyond health, including public attitudes to \u2018deservingness\u2019 attached to welfare state distributional policies in domains as diverse as labour markets and education [67\u2013,68,69,70,71].

Nevertheless, it demonstrates the mutability of such preferences in the face of structured moral deliberation. This finding has three main repercussions. It furnishes a critical lens for the interpretation of stated preference surveys; introduces a note of caution into dominant modes of health care funding allocation decisions premised on utility maximization; and implies the value of deliberative methods as a complement to both. We observed a strong inclination for equality and humanitarianism amongst study participants, regardless of experimental group. These moral impulses prevailed over consequentialist logic, including priority to the young founded on aggregate benefit. The stability of these principles in the face of changing allocative preferences signals their importance as public values \u2013 but it also hints at the complexity of values-based decision-making. The public seems, at face value, to believe in equality of access and defend a set of shared human entitlements to care. It also seems to assign intuitive priority to children. The challenge of reconciling these convictions demands processes nimble enough to negotiate this paradox. Spaces for moral deliberation \u2013 whether in large-scale surveys or focused qualitative engagement \u2013 are essential to arrive at health care priorities that reflect what we collectively hold dear.",

With drug treatment, both child and adult patients can be expected to live about 20 years from diagnosis, after which they usually die from progressive complications of the disease.
