Since there is very limited options (either vaccine or specific therapy) approved for humans against these viruses, there is an urgent need to develop prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. Previously we reported a high-throughput screening (HTS) protocol to identify entry inhibitors for three highly pathogenic viruses (EBOV, LASV, and AIV) using a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudotyping platform which allows us to perform the screening in a BSL-2 facility. In this report, we have adopted this screening protocol to evaluate traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) in an effort to discover entry inhibitors against these viruses. Here we show that extracts of the following Chinese medicinal herbs exhibit potent anti-Ebola viral activities: Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, Citrus aurantium L., Viola yedoensis Makino, Prunella vulgaris L., Coix lacryma-jobi L. var. mayuen (Roman.) Stapf, Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit., and Morus alba L. This study represents a proof-of-principle investigation supporting the suitability of this assay for rapid screening TCMs and identifying putative entry inhibitors for these viruses.",

            "text": "Emerging and reemerging viruses pose severe global health concerns. The four influenza pandemics in last 100 years are the examples of how these viruses impact humans. Avian influenza viruses pose significant threats to animal and human health. They are a source of genetic diversity that permits the emergence of pandemic influenza by means of genetic reassortment with prevailing human influenza viruses. A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, caused disease outbreaks in poultry in China and seven other east Asian countries after 2003 [Guan et al., 2004] . The recent Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa underscores the unpreparedness of humans dealing with such deadly virus. EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) belong to the filovirus family Filoviradae and can cause a rapidly lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. Since 1967, both outbreaks of EBOV and MARV occurred repeatedly and unpredictedly, with new strains showing high mortality rates [Towner et al., 2006] . Lassa virus, a member of the arenaviridae family, represent two important etiological agents of viral hemorrhagic fevers [Nichol et al., 2000] . Since clinically approved antiviral therapeutics or vaccines against these viruses are limited, there is an urgent need to discover and develop antivirals, either targeting one particular virus or broadly targeting multiple viruses. Traditional Chinese medicine has been playing an important role in human healthcare in China and Asia for thousands of years, and now it is also a valuable source for new drug discovery in modern medicine. As our knowledge on the therapeutic benefits of these Chinese medicines increases, research efforts on the previously serendipitous treatments to discover new medicines are greatly intensified. Natural products including Chinese medicines have been and continue to be a rich source for new drug discover [Newman and Cragg, 2007] since they have a large structural diversity and complexity that remains unmatched by other drug formats [Rosen et al., 2009] . Artemisinin, also known as Qing Hao Su in Chinese which was originally isolated from the plant Artemisia annua L, and its semisynthetic derivatives are a group of drugs that possess the most rapid action of all current drugs against Plasmodium falciparum malaria [White, 1997] , are an illustrious example of how new antimicrobial drugs can be discovered from Chinese Medicine herbs. Tetrandrine, which was isolated and identified as an active ingredient in a Chinese medicinal herb, Stephaniae Tetrandrae Radix, was reported to inhibit EBOV infection both in vitro and in vivo [Sakurai et al., 2015] . Also anti-influenza drug discovery efforts on natural products have seen a rapid increase in the recent years [Wang et al., 2006] .",

Then, virus was removed and cells were washed with cold PBS two times before fresh media was added. Temperature was shifted to 37\u02daC to trigger virus entry. At different time points of virus entry, Extract of TCMs or AZT (5 mM) was introduced to assess their impact on virus entry. Triplicate wells were used for each time point. Control infected cell cultures were treated with drug vehicle (DMSO or PBS) only. Virus infection was measured 48 hr postinfection as described above, luciferase levels were determined.",

This strategy is particularly useful for highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola virus, avian influenza virus H5N1, and Lassa virus, since the HIV vector-based surrogate system allows us to perform high throughput screens in the biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) containment instead of the BSL-3 or BSL-4 for the infectious viruses with alleviated safety concerns.

            "text": "Traditional Chinese medicine holds a unique position among all traditional medicines because of its long history in China. Many extracts of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs have been proven to have antiviral activities [Jassim and Naji, 2003 ]. Most of these are generally of low toxicity, cheap, and readily accessible. By using this pseudovirions entry system, we have tested more than four hundreds Chinese herb extracts and show that extracts of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, Citrus aurantium L., Viola yedoensis Makino, Prunella vulgaris L., Coix lacryma-jobi L. var. mayuen (Roman.) Stapf, Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit., and Morus alba L. all exhibited potent inhibitory activity against EBOV glycoprotein entry out of all the extracts tested (Table II) . Some previous reports have showed that Citrus aurantium L. displays anti-HCV activity [Ho et al., 2003 ], the Fig. 5 . Time of addition experiments give insight into extract mechanism. Ebola pseudovirus was incubated with A549 cells at 4\u02daC for 1 hr. After 1 hr of incubation, virus was removed and the temperature was shifted to 37\u02daC to trigger internalization. Prunella vulgaris L. (15.6 mg/ml), AZT (5 mM), or extract vehicle (PBS) was introduced at different time points during infection and the extract effects were assessed as described in Materials and Methods. Data were normalized to vehicle (PBS). Error bars represent standard deviations. extract of Viola yedoensis Makino has high inhibitory activity toward HIV-1 [Ngan et al., 1988] and RSV [Ma et al., 2002] in vitro, the extract of Prunella vulgaris L. has specific activity against Herpes simplex virus (HSV) [Xu et al., 1999] and HIV-1 [Yao et al., 1992] , Morus alba L. showed some activity against Herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) [Du et al., 2003] , HIV, influenza virus and HBV [Geng et al., 2012] . Here we demonstrate that extracts of Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit. display potential inhibitory activity against EBOV-GP entry. These Chinese medicinal herbs merit further investigation as a promising antiviral due to its rich source, low costs, low cytotoxicity, wide acceptability, and strong antiviral properties. The possible mechanism of action of these drugs in inhibiting EBOV entry remains unknown, and further detailed chemical research to identify and purify the active ingredient(s) will facilitate its mechanistic analyses and applications. Overall, although more experiments will be needed to fully understand the possible use of any of these herbal extracts against these viruses infection, here we describe a surrogate pseudovirus entry assay that can be used for HTS in a BSL-2 facility for the rapid screening of extensive herbal collections. The identification of one extract of Prunella vulgaris L. [Zhang et al., 2016] previously known to inhibit Ebola virus entry in our repurposing screen further supports the usefulness of our approach. We also detected that Prunella vulgaris L. could block the early attachment step of Ebola entry with time of addition experiment. We hope that our screening efforts will result in the identification of novel herbal extracts for the development of drugs to treat Ebola virus infections or other highly pathogenic viruses. These Chinese medicinal herbs may be used for further drug discovery and development of anti-EBOV. ",
