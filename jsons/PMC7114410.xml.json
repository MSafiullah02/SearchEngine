            "text": "Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) causes disease and mortality in hatchery-reared salmonid fry and in Atlantic salmon postsmolts after transfer to the sea (Hill and Way, 1995, Jarp et al., 1995, Smail et al., 1992). Elucidation of how IPNV interacts with the innate immune system of Atlantic salmon is important to understand its pathogenic properties. IPNV belongs to the genus Aquabirnavirus of the Birnaviridae family. The genome consists of two double-stranded (ds) RNA segments, packed in a non-enveloped single-shelled icosahedrical capsid (Coulibaly et al., 2005, Dobos, 1976, Pous et al., 2005). Segment B encodes VP1, which is a 94 kDa RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) found both in a free and a genome-linked form in the virion (Dobos, 1995). Segment A contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein, which is co-translationally cleaved by the non-structural protease VP4 to generate the mature structural proteins VP2 and VP3 (Duncan et al., 1987). VP2 is the outer capsid protein while VP3 is found in the inner surface of the viral capsid. VP3 has recently been shown to interact with VP1 and with double-stranded RNA (Pedersen et al., 2007). In addition, segment A contains a small overlapping ORF encoding VP5, which is a non-structural protein with undefined properties, proposed to have an anti-apoptotic function and to be of importance for virulence (Santi et al., 2005). The size of VP5 varies depending on the isolate, from 15 kDa to 3.3 kDa, but some isolates lack the VP5 reading-frame altogether (Heppell et al., 1995, Skjesol et al., 2011).",

Type I IFNs are induced upon recognition of viral RNA by the RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5 in the cytoplasm, and by the toll-like receptors TLR3 and TLR7, which are embedded in the membrane of endosomes (Arpaia and Barton, 2011, Takeuchi and Akira, 2007). Upon release, IFNs induce a range of antiviral proteins both in non-infected and infected cells preventing further virus infection. Among the antiviral proteins are Mx, ISG15, viperin and PKR (Chin and Cresswell, 2001, Liu et al., 2011, Samuel, 2001). Targeting initiation of transcription of IFN and IFN-induced genes are frequently used strategies for viruses to establish an infection in the host (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008). IPNV VP4 and VP5 have been shown to inhibit IFN-induced activation of the Mx promoter, but the effect of IPNV proteins on induction of type I IFN is unknown (Skjesol et al., 2009).",

IFNa1, IFNb and IFNc all show potent antiviral activity against IPNV and they induce Mx protein, which inhibits IPNV replication (Rokenes et al., 2007, Svingerud et al., 2012). In this work we chose to study the influence of IPNV proteins on activation of the Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter since IFNa1 is induced in most cells upon stimulation with dsRNA, while IFNb and IFNc are mainly induced in lymphoid organs (Sun et al., 2009, Svingerud et al., 2012). Salmon IFNa1 shows expression properties strikingly similar to mammalian IFN\u03b2, which is induced through the RIG-I/MDA5 and TLR3 pathways (Bergan et al., 2006, Sun et al., 2009, Svingerud et al., 2012). Similar to the human IFN\u03b2 promoter, the salmon IFNa1 promoter has one NF\u03baB-binding site and two IRF binding sites (Bergan et al., 2006).",

To elucidate the reason why the virus does not induce a successful IFN response, we here investigated the effect of the individual IPNV proteins on IFNa1 induction. The present work demonstrates that IPNV has developed multiple mechanisms to inhibit induction of IFNa1 transcription. Surprisingly, however, we found that VP1 strongly activated IFNa1 transcription, which may in part explain why the virus needs potent IFN-antagonistic properties.",

As activator of the IFNa1 promoter, we used Atlantic salmon IPS-1, which is known to activate the IFNa1 promoter upon overexpression (Lauksund et al., 2009). IPS-1 is a key adapter protein in the RIG-I/MDA5 signaling pathway, which controls type I IFN expression in most cells. TO-cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid and a plasmid containing one of the IPNV genes and a plasmid expressing IPS-1. Luciferase activity in the cells was measured at 48 h after transfection. The results showed that the viral proteins preVP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5 inhibited IPS-1 mediated activation of the IFNa1 promoter (Fig. 2A). The strongest inhibitory effect was observed with VP4, which virtually abolished promoter activation. In contrast, VP1 surprisingly increased activation of the IFNa1 promoter when co-transfected with IPS-1. To find out if VP1 could activate the IFNa1 promoter by itself, individual VP constructs were co-transfected with IFNa1 promoter construct into TO cells and assayed for luciferase expression. As shown in Fig. 2B, VP1 expression alone did indeed activate the IFNa1 promoter while preVP2-VP5 gave a reduction in promoter activity compared with the transfection control.",

An obvious question was if the IFN antagonistic effect of VP4 was due to its protease activity (Duncan et al., 1987). First we studied whether VP4 might degrade IRF1 and IRF3. However, no degradation of the IRFs could be detected in a Western blot following co-transfection of VP4 with the IRF1 or IRF3 (data not shown). We then wanted to test if IFN antagonistic activity of VP4 was dependent of its protease activity by creating a protease-dead mutant of VP4. Since mutations in the site of the lysine general base K674 have been shown to be even more efficient in abolishing protease activity than mutating the reactive serine residue (Petit et al., 2000), this site was chosen for a single amino acid mutation. This mutation has previously shown to abolish the protease activity of VP4 with all tested mutations (Petit et al., 2000). The expressed VP4 and VP4K674A proteins were present in comparable amounts when detected with an anti-flag antibody (Fig. S2). The constructed VP4K674A was found to be just as efficient as the wild type VP4 in inhibition of IPS1-mediated IFNa1 promoter activation in a co-transfection assay (Fig. 7\n). This suggests that the IFN antagonistic property of VP4 is independent of its protease activity. We then looked for potential non-covalent binding of VP4 to the IRFs. However, we did not observe any binding of IRF1/3 to VP4 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay (data not shown). As there are an abundance of proteins and regulators involved in the IRF branch of the signaling cascade, there are many other potential targets for inhibition. Unfortunately, far from all of the potential signaling members have been cloned in Atlantic salmon.",

            "text": "IPNV replication is strongly inhibited in salmon cells treated by type I IFN (Robertsen et al., 2003, Svingerud et al., 2012). The virus must therefore be dependent on inhibition of IFN induction during infection. This is supported by the observation that IPNV infection of TO cells only resulted in very small changes in the amounts of IFNa transcripts (Fig. 1). Moreover, the present work demonstrates that IPNV encodes proteins with powerful IFN antagonistic properties where all of the proteins encoded by IPNV segment B were able to inhibit induction of IFNa1 through the RIG-I/MDA5 signaling pathway. Overexpression of preVP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5 all inhibited IPS-1 mediated activation of the IFNa1 promoter. While VP4 virtually abolished IFNa1 promoter activation, preVP2, VP3 and VP5 all displayed a strong albeit not complete inhibition. These viral proteins are likely to act on signaling factors downstream of IPS-1 since they all inhibited activation of the IFNa1 promoter mediated by overexpression of IRF1 and IRF3. The mechanisms of inhibition observed by preVP2, VP3 and VP5 remain to be elucidated. The dsRNA binding ability of VP3 has previously been proposed as a mechanism for avoiding antiviral host responses (Pedersen et al., 2007). Binding dsRNA is, however, not likely to be the main mechanism of antagonism observed in the present studies, as the assays are based on overexpression of proteins from DNA vectors, and the protein levels of the transfection control, Renilla luciferase, were not affected by the presence of VP3. It is thus possible that VP3 has multiple IFN antagonistic properties, a well-known trait in viruses. One of the most studied viral proteins with multiple functions as an IFN antagonist is the non-structural NS1 protein of influenza A viruses. In addition to being important for enhancing viral mRNA translation, NS1 is able to ablate the host innate immune system both by limiting the induction of IFN by blocking RIG-I activation, and by directly inhibiting antiviral proteins such as PKR and OAS/RNaseL. NS1 also inhibits export of mRNA from the nucleus (reviewed in Hale et al., 2008).",

The protease activity of VP4 is thus not likely to be important for its IFNa antagonistic activity in the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway downstream of IPS-1. As interactions between VP4 and IRF1 or IRF3 were not observed, VP4 is likely to act on other signaling members involved in activation of the IRFs. Potentially VP4 might prevent phosphorylation of the IRFs. Other possibilities are that VP4 might modify the function of the IRFs by promoting or reversing ubiquitination, SUMOylation or ISGylation on the members of the signaling cascade, similar modifications have been shown of other antagonistic viral proteins such as influenza A virus NS1, murine hepatitis virus NSP3 and ebolavirus VP35 (Gack et al., 2009, Kubota et al., 2009, Zheng et al., 2008). It has been shown that the IFN antagonistic activity of the papain-like protease (PLP) of the human coronavirus NL63 is independent of its enzymatic activity (Clementz et al., 2010). The PLP is both a protease and a deubiquitinase, able to process both K-48 and K-63 linked polyubiquitin chains. Ablating these functions either by mutation or by adding a protease inhibitor did not inhibit the antagonistic nature of the protein. Also the protease of the murine hepatitis virus acts as an IFN antagonist, and even if the antagonistic activity is partly dependent on the deubiquitinase activity, the protease defective mutants still retained some antagonistic activity (Zheng et al., 2008). Like these viral proteases, the IFN antagonistic effect of IPNV VP4 seems to be independent of an intact catalytic activity.",

Even if the immunosuppressive nature of IBDV has been well established, the molecular basis for this mechanism is not fully understood. It was recently reported that the VP4 protease of IBDV is inhibiting IFN expression by interacting with the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) (Li et al., 2013). GILZ has previously been shown to bind both NF-\u03baB and IRF3, inhibiting gene transcription directed by these transcription factors (Ogawa et al., 2005, Reily et al., 2006). Whether IPNV VP4 utilizes a similar mechanism as the IBDV VP4 in IFN suppression, is a subject for future studies.",

            "text": "A surprising finding in the present work was the IFN inducible properties of the viral polymerase VP1. Overexpression of VP1 alone potently activated the IFNa1 promoter and increased activation mediated by overexpression of IRF1 and IRF3. Moreover, overexpression of VP1 in combination with IRF1 or IRF3 up-regulated IFNa transcription and increased antiviral activity against IPNV in TO cells. The antiviral activity from the transfected cells with VP1 in combination with IRF1 or IRF3 was due to IFNa since the antiviral activity of the supernatants could be completely negated by the addition of IFNa1 antibody. The IFNa inducing properties of VP1 may be due to synthesis of RNA since it has been demonstrated that VP1 produces RNA from both viral and non-viral sources in vitro (Graham et al., 2011). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that one single amino acid substitution in position 163 abolished the ability of VP1 to activate IFNa1 promoter activation. The VP1S163A mutant has been shown neither to be able to guanylylate nor to produce dsRNA (Xu et al., 2004). Even though the 163 site is not the actual guanylylation site (Graham et al., 2011), this mutant is deficient in producing dsRNA (Xu et al., 2004). RNA synthesized by VP1 may be recognized by RIG-I or MDA5 and thus trigger activation of the IFNa1 promoter. During IPNV infection both viral dsRNA and non-specific RNA species formed by VP1 may thus potentially be recognized by RIG-I/MDA5 risking activation of IFN transcription. IPNV may thus have developed multiple IFN antagonizing mechanisms to avoid triggering of IFN synthesis by VP1 since this virus is highly sensitive to the antiviral activities induced by type I IFNs in cells. dsRNA could not be detected by a dsRNA antibody after transfecting cells with VP1 (data not shown), but antibody binding might be dependent of sizes of dsRNA molecules that are larger than the ones produced by VP1. The concentration of such RNA molecules is also likely to be low, since VP1 is highly dependent on an IPNV specific primer molecule to start synthesis of dsRNA (Dobos, 1995).",
