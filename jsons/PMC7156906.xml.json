Increased and often unrestricted antibiotic use in the clinical and farming settings is to blame for this issue. Growing surveillances based on genomic sequencing of microbes from the natural environment, human settlements, and clinical settings have been conducted worldwide to investigate the evolution and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) [2\u20134]. In recent years, the eco-evolutionary feedback loops between ecological and evolutionary dynamics have been increasingly recognized, where spillover of antibiotic use to natural and semi-natural environments may have profound implications on the distribution of ARGs in natural bacterial populations which serve as environmental reservoirs of resistance determinants [5, 6]. However, how resistance evolves, and how ARGs are maintained and dispersed back to clinical settings is poorly understood. Understanding the dynamics of the continuous feedback loops from clinical to nature and back may prove critical for preventing and controlling the problem of antibiotic resistance.",

            "text": "The rapidly developing sequencing technology increasingly enables the identification of emerging opportunistic pathogens and taxonomical classification based on their genomic information [7\u20139]. Naturally, opportunistic pathogens inhabit in the natural environment and are occasionally resistant to common antibiotics. Among these previously unknown pathogens, many are belong to species of the Enterobacteriaceae family [10, 11]. Meanwhile, many Enterobacteriaceae species are commensal microbiota of human and animal guts, but under certain conditions, can be opportunistic pathogens that cause infections [12]. These species often have other animal hosts, or they can be found in more diverse environments, such as soil and sewage [13]. Enterobacteriaceae species (including E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter) are also famous for their antibiotic resistance and regarded as some of the most dangerous pathogens since they can efficiently acquire various ARGs through efficient plasmid transmission [14]. The ability of these species to disseminate between habitats and transferring ARGs highlights their importance as mediators in the eco-evolutionary feedback loops that disperse ARGs from natural environments back to clinical settings. The taxonomy of Enterobacteriaceae is complex, containing 28 genera and over 75 species [15], while novel species are continuously discovered. Recognizing and characterizing Enterobacteriaceae species, especially those of emerging opportunistic pathogens, is critical for understanding the dynamics of the evolution of AMR.",

AF18 grew slowly but provided drug-resistance to its companion by carrying a blaCTX-M-3 resistant gene. The co-infection brought perplexity in both diagnosis and treatment of the patients. In order to provide new evidence and detailed information for opportunistic pathogens about the complex issues that they may cause in clinical infections, we conducted a study with the three following objectives: (1) Clarifying the taxonomy of AF18 using whole-genome phylogenetic analysis; (2) Testing the ability of AF18 to protect K. pneumoniae from antibiotics in co-culture experiments; and (3) Analyzing the adaptation mechanisms of AF18 base on transcriptome sequencing. Finally, we find that AF18 is a strain of an undefined novel species in the family Enterobacteriaceae, and that sensitive K. pneumoniae can survive when co-cultured with AF18 in Luria-Bertani broth containing 8 \u03bcg/mL ceftriaxone. Furthermore, genomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal the genomic characteristics of this rare pathogen and the regulation mechanisms of how it adapts to multiple habitats and its association with ARGs transfer.",

One type was mucous, entirely pink, and of 4-5 mm in diameter, which was finally identified as a K. pneumoniae clone sensitive to common antibiotics (Table 1); the other type was composed by small (2-3 mm in diameter) red-centered colonies with clear and transparent edges (Fig. 1a). The bacteria of the small colonies seemed prone to adhere to the cells of K. pneumoniae and were not able to be isolated until extensive dilutions. The taxonomy of the small colonies was not immediately identified by the microbiological laboratory in the hospital, and we designated it as strain AF18. AF18 exhibited resistance to most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Table 1). As the infection was rather intractable and finally cured by intravenous amikacin, the final diagnosis for the patient was a co-infection caused by a sensitive K. pneumoniae strain and a multidrug-resistant strain of unknown species.\n\n",

However, considering cutoffs commonly used for intra-species classification by whole-genome ANI > 95% [17] and 16S rDNA identity > 99% [18], 16S rDNA classification found two more strains of the species, namely Enterobacteriaceae bacterium ENNIH1, and Phytobacter ursingii strain CAV1151 (Table S3). Thus, we think that 16S rDNA can also be used as a marker gene to clarify the taxonomy of isolated strains, but we need to examine the identity cutoff we used carefully.",

Efflux pump genes which confer resistance to macrolides, quinolones and aminoglycosides were also identified. Meanwhile, the AF18 genome possesses 20 genomic islands, 11 prophages, and five CRISPR sequences (Table S5), suggesting the active transfer of stress-adaptive genes by these mobile genetic elements in this species. More importantly, markers of soil-inhabiting bacteria, including a complete nitrogen fixation gene cluster and ksgA\u2014\u2014 a pesticide-resistant gene, were found in AF18 genome, which suggests that AF18 is able to colonize natural environments.

Sequence alignment shows that pAF18_2 is similar to many plasmids from other Enterobacteriaceae species, such as E. coli (KF914891.1, KC788405.1, CP028486.1), K. pneumoniae (KX928750.1, CP026179.1), and C. freundii (KT989599.1), and they contain identical replication origins, replication and transcription systems, plasmid partition systems, and a partial gene cluster responsible for plasmid conjugation, which indicates that the plasmid might be compatible with all these Enterobacteriaceae host species. Besides, these plasmids share a common anti-restriction system that ensures they would not be destroyed by the restriction-modified system in other host strains. Specifically, the pAF18_2 contains an active transposase system with complete IS elements which had acquired the blaCTX-M-3 gene and an arsenical resistant system. Many other DNA manipulating enzymes, such as integrase and DNA invertase, were also identified in the plasmid, all of which could facilitate the plasmid in efficiently acquiring and transferring antibiotic-resistance genes and other stress-adaptive genes among Enterobacteriaceae strains. Unfortunately, due to constraints related to the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus, we were unable to perform conjugation experiments.\n",

It has been reported that plasmid carriage may slow down growth rate due to the cellular cost imposed [19], and thus we generate a new strain\u2014AF18-NC by deleting the resistant plasmid of AF18. Then we measured the independent growth curve of the three strains\u2014 K. pneumoniae, AF18, and AF18-NC, respectively (Fig. 4c). As expected, AF18-NC did grow faster than its mother strain AF18 since it was relieved from the plasmid-caused cellular cost.

Analysis of the non-coding sRNA expression profile identified a total of 15 sRNAs differentially expressed between AF18 and AF18-NC. Interestingly, two of the down-regulated sRNAs in AF18, namely sRNA00063 and sRNA00291 (Fig. S2), shared 98% of their predicted target genes which constitute up to 56% of those differentially expressed genes as mentioned above, suggesting that these two sRNAs have a key role in promoting growth.

In the pathogenic consortium of the co-infection in our study, although taking a very small proportion, AF18 provides strong protection for the entire pathogenic consortium against antibiotic damage. The cooperation between the K. pneumoniae and AF18 makes the infectious situation more complicated and difficult in terms of therapies than infections caused by either of them. Meanwhile, as the strain AF18 only took a minor proportion and closely adhered to co-infected K. pneumoniae, it was prone to be concealed by the dominant K. pneumoniae and hard to be detected and isolated, which led to inaccurate etiological diagnosis and improper anti-infective treatment at first admission. As AF18 and other strains of the same species are rare opportunistic pathogen with little documentation, and conventional testings for bacterial identification are not always correct for such novel species, as shown in this study, WGS comprised a straightforward approach for accurate taxonomy identification.",

Phylogenetic analysis with the whole genome of AF18 assigned it to the Enterobacteriaceae family. However, the nomenclature of this novel species is still under discussion due to very limited documentation [21]. The first report of the novel species was in 2016 when [Kluyvera] intestini str. GT-16 was isolated from the stomach of a patient with gastric cancer [22], and in the following years, strains of this species were emergingly discovered [23, 24]. Of note, AF18 is the first clear report of human infection of this novel species, as [Kluyvera] intestine GT-16 and Matakosakonia sp. MRY16_398 were more likely a common resident in the gastrointestinal tract or a by-stander of the diverticulitis. Although the first strain of [Kluyvera] intestini str. GT-16 had been assigned to the genus Kluyvera, the ANI of strains in this novel species to typical Kluyvera spp. are less than 80.8%, even farther than the distance to other genera, such as Kasokonia (ANI, 82.3%), and typical Enterobacter spp. (ANI, 81%), suggesting that AF18 and its species is not a typical Kluyvera species or should not be included in this genus. Except AF18 which cause a co-infection with a typical pathogen, two of the other strains of this species ([Kluyvera] intestini str. GT-16 [25], and Matakosakonia sp. MRY16_398 [23]) were both isolated from patients in Japan, while the other three strains (Enterobacter sp. NFR05, Enterobacter sp. Bisph2, and Enterobacteriaceae bacterium ENNIH2) were isolated from rhizoplane (China), sandy soil (Algeria) [26], and hospital sewage (USA) [24], respectively, indicating a wide range of environments that this species can inhabit.",

In fact, strains of this species have been identified as an important source of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-encoding genes and even carbapenem-resistant genes. For example, Enterobacteriaceae bacterium ENNIH2 is KPC-2 positive [24], Metakosakonia sp. MRY16\u2013398 carries blaIMP-6, blaCTX-M-2, and aadA2 gene [23], and the [Kluyvera] intestini str. GT-16 contains many ARGs that even confer resistance to polymyxin [25]. A more distant relative of AF18\u2014Pytobacter ursingii (previously named Kluyvera intermedia) was found to be KPC positive and carbapenem-resistant [28]. AF18 carries genes of the hcp-clp and mprAB system which are powerful in implementing persistence status and endows resistance to many environmental stresses including all kinds of antibiotics [29, 30]. These species can acquire various ARGs from their Enterobacteriaceae relatives in natural environments and host gut. For example, E. coli and K. pneumoniae can share these ARGs through various genetic mobile elements or even in a more efficient manner of conjugating resistant plasmids [31]. Thus, the species of AF18 may prove important in spreading ARGs and function as a mediator in the eco-evolutionary feedback loops of AMR. In this regard, the novel species and many other emerging opportunistic pathogens of Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Kluyvera spp. and Enterobacter spp., deserve more attention in clinical practice and in the field of antibiotic resistance control.",

Being antibiotic-resistant by itself, we speculate that AF18 just upregulated the production of antibiotic-hydrolase to generate a niche of low antibiotic concentration for the sensitive K. pneumoniae to hide. Such co-operation between different bacteria has been deeply investigated in experiments, and relevant theories or mathematic models have been fully developed which illustrated the important role of growth regulation in maximizing the benefit and population of the entire consortium [32\u201334]. Our study provides empirical evidence for these hypotheses and highlights the importance of mutualistic relationships between microbes in a co-infection scenario in clinical settings. Transcriptome analysis further identified genes involved in growth regulation and pointed to two novel sRNAs that might be the key regulators of the process. As antibiotics are not always successful, especially in treating opportunistic pathogens, the sRNAs that promote the growth of host strains as we had identified may serve as targets of bacteriostatic agents and deserve further investigations.",

In-depth genomic analysis suggests the ability of this species to transfer between the natural environment and host habitats and in disseminating antibiotic-resistant genes, which potentiates it to be an important disseminator of antibiotic resistance to clinical pathogens. When co-infected with typical pathogens, the resistant opportunistic strain can provide temporary protection for the whole consortium and cause confusions in the etiological diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, although the strain by itself is possibly not a pernicious pathogen for immunocompetent patients. Taken together, Enterobacteriaceae bacterium AF18 and other newly emerging opportunistic pathogens complicate the situation of antibiotic resistance control in clinical practice and deserve in-depth investigation including methods for surveillance and control.",
