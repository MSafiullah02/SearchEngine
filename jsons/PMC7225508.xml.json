Furthermore, there are a lot of disseminated initiatives, which propose a lot of services for Smarter Life. To maintain the global sustainability and resilience, a new paradigm is thus required, which would allow integrating the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system [1].",

Sustainable digitalised societies are subjects of medium term. Already today, precautions must be taken to deal with inevitable societal changes that will accompany digitalisation: e.g. radical structural change on the labour markets as a result of advancing automation, networking, creating new activities and jobs, co-design and sharing common goods, to mention just a few. In a long term, the focus is made on the future: the way humans interact with technologies and, more generally, the Information World; risks and challenges to human personality and integrity, ethical aspects of digitalisation, etc. This includes the exploration of the emerging concepts in the innovative area of sustainability and digital technology [4], the results of societal transformations, as well as creation of new practices in governing Society.",

We should think in accordance to propulsors in the context of the progression of Society, and the added value these propulsors are inducing. A propulsor can be a new law, a political or strategic will, a new technology like a digital system, etc. The propulsions of Society are enabled by propulsors into activities of Society in the form of information services. An information service contains a value proposition [7]. Its aim is not limited to increasing the efficiency of existing business processes, but generating additional value for businesses by creating and enabling situations, in which value may emerge.",

They are based on the concept of common goods [8] whose basic resource is of natural origin (pastures and forests). In contrast, the basic resource of the information common goods is artificial: data, information or knowledge. For both natural and information common goods, there is a risk of falling into a tragedy of the commons [9], when unlimited usage (for natural ones) and uncontrolled rush for digital innovations (for information common goods) might lead to their exhaustion. To avoid the tragedy of the commons and make information common goods efficient and resilient, they are organised in an institutional form of informational common. Myriads of services, which are envisaged as information common goods, currently are, have been and will be developing practices, create new situations, lead to new added value. And this added value in services comes from enabling informational commons [10].",

The information plays the key role: it enables the development of multiple propulsions and provides their informational base. This informational base consists of a multitude of informational models, all oriented towards the design and implementation of propulsions. In a generic way, TLS is a social configuration that allows all contributors to have access to informational models of the information service. They can therefore criticize these models.

Traditionally, PPP is intended to facilitate public-private partnerships mainly in the context of infrastructure (hospitals, transport, buildings) and is not particularly focused on services. To enable service creation, our exploratory approach suggests to expand PPP to people-public-private partnerships for services (4PS). 4PS does not only benefit from the advantages of PPP that typically allocates each risk to the party that can best manage and handle it, optimises management responsibility and finds coherence between private interests and the public interest. 4PS specifically targets service design and co-creation, where the key role is given to talented persons who actively collaborate in defining, concretising and developing services.",
