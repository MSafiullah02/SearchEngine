Emerging zoonoses have increased in recent years with serious consequences for public health. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus (NiV), Hendra virus (HeV), West Nile virus (WNV), monkeypox, and, most recently, Ebola virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) are all animal-related diseases. These zoonoses have served as wake-up calls to the public health, wildlife, and veterinary communities and heralded the need for closer collaboration (Chomel et al. 2007).",

More often than not, we have not been able to shift the epidemiology curve to the far left and identify zoonotic diseases in animal populations before spillover into humans. Instead public health has used taxpayers as sentinels. Such was the case with WNV when early warning came in the form of dead crows 2.5 months before any human infections took place. Veterinary pathology studies on wildlife were ultimately the key to the recognition and understanding of WNV. Wildlife studies have been critical to the understanding of other recent emerging zoonoses, and their importance cannot be underestimated.",

A recent retrospective study of 335 emerging infectious episodes over a 64-year period (1940\u20132004) also emphasized the role of wildlife as a source of emerging infections (Cutler et al. 2010). Rodents and bats, in particular, have been associated with many serious disease outbreaks such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lassa fever, and NiV encephalitis (Morens and Fauci 2013). SARS was linked to colonies of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sp.) infected with a coronavirus in Malaysia that subsequently spread to Hong Kong and Toronto, Canada. NiV and HeV have also both been linked to bats (Artois et al. 2011).",

In fact, although it is true that more than 15 virus families have been identified in 200 species of 12 bat families and that they are more likely to be infected with more zoonotic viruses than rodents (O'Shea et al. 2014), studies have shown no evidence that a decrease in bat density would reduce viral prevalence (Plowright et al. 2015). Instead, they found that disrupting bat colonies and increasing bat stress may increase the amplitude of viral shedding. (Halpin et al. 2011). In one study, Pteropus bats from Australia and Malaysia were inoculated with NiV and HeV by natural routes of infection. In spite of intensive sampling, researchers found no NiV in Malaysian bats, and HeV was reisolated from only one Australian bat. These results suggest opportunities for henipavirus transmission may be limited and that the probability of spillover is low (Halpin et al. 2011).",

Simple things like vaccinating and fencing horses away from fruit-bearing trees where bats may roost and feed could decrease exposure to HeV (Plowright et al. 2015). Changing agricultural practices by the creation of buffer zones between fruiting trees and domestic animals would decrease the incidence of NiV and HeV (Smith and Wang 2013). In Bangladesh, the installation of barriers on the date palms that prevent the bats from accessing the collection vessels is a simple strategy currently being investigated to control transmission of NiV (Smith and Wang 2013).

Bats have remarkable immune systems, and we need to study them. \u201cThe bat immune system is astonishingly tolerant of most pathogens\u2014a trait that could pose risks to people, but that also offers clues to preventing human disease of aging, including cancer\u201d (Angier 2015; Baker 2014).

            "text": "What sets bats apart from other mammals is their ability to fly. Flight results in a 15-fold to 16-fold increase in bat metabolic rate in comparison with the sevenfold increase in rodents running to exhaustion or the twofold increase in metabolic rate of most flying birds (O'Shea et al. 2014). Bats use 20 times more energy than other mammals of the same size during an average day (Slezak 2012). The body temperature is consistently above normal in a fever-like state. This persistent fever state keeps viral replication at a low level, and the virus never overruns the bat immune system (Grant 2014). But all this energy production generates free radicals that damage DNA. In spite of that bats, are extremely long lived, some living up to 40 years of age. They live 3 to 10 times longer than other mammals of similar size (Grant 2014) and demonstrate low levels of cancer (Wynne and Wang 2013). Bats have evolved a strategy to avoid DNA damage (Lyn 2013; Slezak 2012). Scientists looked at the fruit bat Pteropus alecto and the insectivorous bat Myotis davidii and found a concentration of genes in the DNA damage checkpoint (Zhang et al. 2013). They also found bats were missing a gene segment known to trigger extreme and potentially fatal cytokine storms (Lyn 2013), leading scientists to speculate that if we can manipulate the human immune response to be more like a bat immune response, we may have a better chance of surviving diseases that bats are immune to (Slezak 2012). Instead of characterizing bats as \u201cpathogen ferries on wings\u201d (Grant 2014), we need to study them. We need to develop bat cell culture assays and bat-specific reagents to examine lymphocyte proliferation, antibody and cytokine synthesis, cell-mediated immune responses, and a host of other immunologic functions in bats that make them important reservoirs of emerging viruses (Calisher et al. 2006). We don't need batricide. We need intensified wildlife research.",

An Animal Mortality Monitoring Network (AMMN) was established during the period 2001 to 2003 in northeast Gabon and in northwest Republic of Congo and collected data from hunters on animal morbidity/mortality. Over 60% of the 21 carcasses reported by hunters and tested were infected with the Ebola virus (Bisson et al. 2015). During outbreaks of WNV, raptors emerged as excellent sentinels for the virus. In one study, raptor admissions to rehabilitation clinics took place fourteen weeks earlier than other surveillance methods (Nemeth et al. 2007). When dealing with a previously unknown or a re-emerging zoonotic threat, the performance of systematic necropsies with tissue sampling for virus isolation and sequencing is critical (Olson et al. 2012).",

Bird species as diverse as bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus), and Chilean flamingoes (Phoenicopterus chilensis) all succumbed to the virus. The zoo was full of sentinel species. When New York City entered the second summer of WNV, the first warning came not from trapped mosquitoes nor from sentinel chickens but from an IHC-positive Guanay cormorant (Phalacrocorax bougainvillii) at the Bronx Zoo. The list of known susceptible bird species is now quite lengthy (Komar 2003), and species other than crows have been found to play an important role in transmission of WNV, illustrating the danger of too narrow a focus when dealing with a new disease.",

The availability of serum banks allowed the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) to establish the temporal sequence of WNV. By evaluating paired serum samples from Bronx Zoo elephants, they were able to demonstrate that WNV appeared for the first time in the captive collection in August 1999.",

Unfortunately, samples that tested negative for WNV were not banked for additional testing. After all of the effort and considerable expense that had been required to collect and test birds on a nationwide basis, only one diagnosis was pursued. Had tissues been banked, we could have tested those birds that were negative for WNV for other viruses such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, which later emerged as a major concern. This further underscores the need for a One Health approach to emerging zoonotic threats.",

Traditional literature suggested the primary target tissue for WNV was the brain. However, gross pathological examination, virus isolation, and IHC studies on the Bronx Zoo cases and wild crows indicated that many tissues could be positive in a WNV-infected bird. Working with USAMRIID, IHC and virus isolation were done on all of the tissues that had been collected at necropsy on the captive collection birds and wild crows. Of all of the tissues, only kidney was positive 100% of the time (Steele et al. 2000). A year later, after further studies, the New York State Department of Health amended its submission protocol and requested batched tissues from each bird for testing, but many positive cases were probably missed during early surveillance efforts due to too narrow a case definition.",

            "text": "In the fall of 1999, the accepted dogma was that WNV was only transmitted through the bite of a mosquito. However, WNV-positive birds had dramatic enteric pathology and demonstrated abundant viral antigen on IHC staining of intestine and kidney, which suggests they were shedding large volumes of virus into the environment. This raised the question of whether alternative modes of transmission could be involved in the epidemiology of WNV. Aerosol transmission had been known to occur with WNV in a laboratory setting. If WNV-positive flamingoes were shedding virus into their pond, could other flamingoes be getting infected via ingestion of the virus via the fecal\u2013oral route or were they being exposed via aerosol? There was also abundant viral antigen in ovarian and testicular tissue, which suggested vertical transmission was also a possibility. However, there was no federal or state funding available to do the necessary transmission studies. Ultimately, the Bronx Zoo, in a first-of-its-kind public-private partnership, donated $25,000 to the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, which had the necessary BL-3 level biosecurity to run the experimental studies. These studies confirmed that birds were acquiring WNV via aerosol as well as via the fecal\u2013oral route (Komar et al. 2002), which had direct impact on how zoos handled suspect cases. This finding ultimately led to the creation of a rapid diagnostic test using oral and cloacal swabs that was adopted by many health departments (Komar et al. 2002; Stone et al. 2004). By 2002, patients had acquired WNV via transfusions and organ transplants (Charatan 2002; Cushing et al. 2004), babies had been born with WNV or became infected through breastfeeding (CDC 2002), and alternative modes of transmission were formally recognized in humans.",

            "text": "Another concern raised by the animal studies was the level of viremias in infected birds. WNV IHC indicated birds were \u201chot\u201d in Department of Defense terminology. There was concern the birds could present a health risk to animal handlers. Veterinarians and wildlife rehabilitators treating and housing neurologic crows and raptors might be getting exposed to large volumes of virus. But it was generally assumed the viremias with this new strain of WNV would be low, like those that occur with St. Louis encephalitis. When viremia studies were performed, the results were astonishing, and they prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to announce its plans to do occupational hazard studies on veterinarians and bird handlers. In Smithsonian magazine, Dr. Thomas Monath, virologist extraordinaire, said, \u201cI couldn't believe the incredible viremias these birds cook up \u2026 there's no precedent for it. There were from a trillion to ten trillion viral particles per milliter of blood. That's beyond no precedent. That's almost beyond belief. No self-respecting bird can gin up a viremia higher than 100,000 particles with St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus. So some birds are almost a billion-fold more infectious with West Nile than with SLE\u201d (Hall 2003). Basic histopathology and IHC offered another preview into human pathology. One of the zoos\u2019 bird mortalities had demonstrated pathology and IHC staining of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord consistent with poliomyelitis. The first human patients had presented with profound muscle paralysis that had not fit with the initial diagnosis of SLE. Poliomyelitis in patients with WNV neuroinvasive disease was first published in 2002 (Glass et al. 2002), but animal studies suggested its possibility in August 1999.",

            "text": "Many of the neurologic issues that later emerged as concerns in human patients were first seen in veterinary pathology studies. One of the more sobering and prescient histopathologic findings in zoo animals was the presence of ongoing inflammation of the brain weeks to months after initial infection with WNV. In 1999, WNV was believed to cause a mild febrile self-limiting illness in the majority of patients, with a small percentage developing neuroinvasive disease. However, a 1983 Russian publication (Pogodina et al. 1983) on primates inoculated with a number of strains of WNV found all were capable of producing long-term neurologic sequelae and viral persistence regardless of neurologic status of the animals. Was WNV-99 really self-limiting? What did the primate studies mean for us? With this in mind, pathologists at the Bronx Zoo intensively evaluated the brains of all known seropositive animals regardless of their clinical signs at the time of infection. Evaluation of a snow leopard (Panthera uncia) and a Greater Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) that died 3 and 8 months after infection showed dramatic lymphoplasmacytic perivascular cuffing. An asymptomatic babirousa (Babyrousa babyrussa) died 10 months after seroconversion and also had evidence of ongoing inflammation, which suggested even subclinical infections might result in long-term central nervous system pathology and possible viral persistence. In 2004, it was recognized that WNV infection could result in a protracted convalescent period with long-term problems with memory, confusion, clinical depression, muscle weakness, tremors (Carson et al. 2006; Hall et al. 2008; Hughes et al. 2007; Klee et al. 2004; Sejvar 2007), and Parkinsonian-like disorders (Hughes et al. 2007) 18 months after infection. Sixty percent of encephalitic patients in a Houston study reported symptoms 5 years after infection (Voelker 2008). Patients with milder forms of illness are just as likely to suffer long-term health problems as encephalitis cases. Eighty-four percent of patients in a study on West Nile fever reported persistent fatigue, 59% had memory problems, and 49% had ongoing muscle weakness (Carson et al. 2006). It wasn't until 2006 that WNV was found in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of a human patient 4 months after initial diagnosis (Penn et al. 2006). The hamster was established as a model for West Nile encephalitis in 2001 (Xiao et al. 2001). It was not until 2010 that a murine model of viral persistence was established (Appler et al. 2010). It showed that WNV persisted in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues for up to six months after infection in mice with subclinical infections. What does this mean for the estimated 1.2 million people with asymptomatic WNV infections in the United States and possible subclinical disease? Ironically, in 2005, a hamster study on WNV persistence found virus was shed in the urine up to 8 months after infection (Tesh et al. 2005), which shifted the focus back to the impact of WNV on the kidney. Viral RNA was detected in the urine of an encephalitic patient 8 days after symptom onset in 2005 (Tonry et al. 2005). A 2012 long-term study of patients in Houston found an association between neuroinvasive infection and the development of chronic kidney disease (Nolan et al. 2012). We may be seeing the tip of an iceberg in terms of long-term sequelae of WNV.",
