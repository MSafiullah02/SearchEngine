Although respiratory viruses are commonly detected in critically ill patients using RT-PCR, their role in the pathogenesis of severe pneumonia and ARDS is less clear.14, 15 Respiratory viruses may be the sole cause of CAP and ARDS in some patients, or may be a risk factor predisposing patients to infections with other organisms, or may also represent concurrent upper respiratory tract infection, colonization, or prolonged viral shedding.16, 17, 18, 19, 20\n",

However, viral strains associated with ARDS, such as the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus strain, are the identical to those seen in mild cases.21, 22 A combination of variable host factors and the host immune response therefore likely leads to the development of severe pneumonia and ARDS. Detailed review of the pathologic mechanisms implicated in the development of ARDS caused by respiratory viruses is beyond the scope of this article, but several excellent reviews on this topic exist.23, 24, 25, 26 Respiratory viruses initially infect the nasal and bronchial epithelium. This point of entry leads to respiratory airway and alveolar endothelial injury, elaboration of cytokines and chemokines, and recruitment of both innate and adaptive immune cells.27 Specific cytokine profiles vary by virus, but converge on a common end pathway, resulting in the pathologic hallmark of ARDS, diffuse alveolar damage.28, 29, 30 The mechanisms of acute lung injury caused by viral pathogens have important clinical implications; if ARDS results from the inflammatory host response rather than viral-mediated injury, then antiviral therapy alone may not be central to resolution of lung injury.31\n",

            "text": "Diagnosis of respiratory viruses can be made using isolation of intact virus particles from cell culture, viral antigen detection by immunofluorescence, or multiplex RT-PCR. When available, multiplex RT-PCR provides more rapid diagnosis with equal or better sensitivity and specificity compared with viral culture and immunofluorescence testing.33, 34 Multiplex RT-PCR testing using specimens collected from nasopharyngeal (NP) aspirate or BAL have higher sensitivity compared with nasal swab.35 Studies comparing BAL and NP aspirate have not shown one method to be superior to the other.36 The optimal site of sampling depends on the particular respiratory virus, incubation time, and the duration of symptoms. For patients with viral pneumonia in whom bronchoscopy can safely be performed, the combination of RT-PCR testing from NP plus BAL specimens may increase the diagnostic yield compared with NP testing alone.37, 38\n",

On computed tomography scan of the chest, influenza classically presents with bilateral ground glass opacities, but areas of the alveolar consolidation and air bronchograms are also common.74 Bacterial and viral coinfection is common, particularly in patients greater than 65 years of age, and can complicate up to 34% of cases.75 Radiographic findings typical of bacterial pneumonia, such as alveolar consolidation or air bronchograms, are not specific enough to confirm or exclude the presence of secondary bacterial pnuemonia.76 Other important complications of influenza in critically ill patients include venous thromboembolism, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, and neurologic manifestations (confusion, seizures, unconsciousness, encephalopathy, quadriparesis, and encephalitis).77, 78\n",

A retrospective cohort study of 20 patients with MERS-CoV treated with combination interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin initiated a median of 3 days after diagnosis found reduced 14-day mortality compared with 24 patients treated with supportive care alone.101 In 2015, a MERS-CoV antibody, LCA60, was isolated from memory B cells of a human patient previously infected with the virus.102 This antibody has the potential to be used for postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of MERS-CoV, but data for its efficacy in human patients are lacking.",
