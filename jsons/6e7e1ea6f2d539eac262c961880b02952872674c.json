We show that the time series of infected population and deaths of the most impacted and unprepared countries exhibits an asymptotic power law behavior, compatible with the propagation of a signal in a fractal network. We propose a model which predicts an asymptotically self-similar expansion of deaths in time before containment, and the final death toll under total containment measures, as a function of the delay in taking those measures after the expansion is observed. The physics of the model resembles the expansion of a flame in a homogeneous domain with a fractal dimension 3.75. After containment measures are taken, the natural fractal structure of the network is drastically altered and a secondary evolution is observed. This evolution, akin to the homogeneous combustion in a static isolated enclosure with a final quenching, has a characteristic time of 20.1 days, according to available data of the pandemic behavior in China. The proposed model is remarkably consistent with available data, which supports the simplifying hypotheses made in the model. A universal formulation for a quarantine as a function of that delay is also proposed.",

These series for each country or geographical region could be considered a extremely useful disaggregated database to gauge the real magnitude of the pandemic. We have performed a global analysis of data made available up to March 26th, 2020, using the concept of selfsimilarity. We hypothesize that the expansion of the infection rapidly reaches an asymptotic homogeneous behavior once a minimum critical number of confirmed cases is known and a rapid expansion immediately follows. In this expansion, the virus exploits the inter-individual network of physical interactions among humans living in cities. This network is sufficiently large and populated to exhibit the drastically reduced degrees of freedom of the laws of big numbers: we observe that the data of those regions where no measures were enacted collapse into a common universal behavior. A self-similar simple law is found: the behavior is reduced to a universal time-power law of the type \u03d5 \u223c \u03c4 \u03b1 for the behavior of COVID-19 pandemic before containment measures are enacted, where \u03c4 is the appropriate non-dimensional time since the onset of the free expansion and \u03d5 the non-dimensional time descriptor of the infected population and mortality. After containment measures are enacted, an exponential decay of mortality can be observed.",

Here, m is an average early mortality descriptor observed with respect to confirmed cases for this disease, which may depend on the population structure and health system. Interestingly, this factor exhibits a relative homogeneity around the value m = 0.15, independently of the country, for the sixteen countries with the current highest impact of COVID-19, with the exception of three countries (Spain, France and Iran).

To do this, as a first approximation we assume a statistical homogeneity of the medium (human ecosystem) where the process of infection, incubation and possible mortality of COVID-19 develops into a pandemic. This allows a dramatic reduction of the relevant independent variables to time only, and supports the possible existence of an asymptotic power-law (a scaling law) in this variable. Two non-dimensional parameters will encapsulate: (i) the fundamental properties that the medium exposes to the action of the virus, and (ii) a simple model for the early behavior of the system prior to the asymptotic regime. The analysis of data shows that a surprisingly homogeneous and universally valid power law can be found for two rather general conditions found worldwide in this specific pandemic: (i) when a country is not prepared for the pandemic and (ii) containment measures are enacted with a delay. A few days of delay from the moment that a few cases of infection (about 100) are confirmed are sufficient to observe what we call a free expansion. In addition, the early behavior is shown to be relevant only for very small times compared to the time of infection T L , which in this work we show it is 20.1 days in average. Based on the accuracy of the simple model obtained when compared to measurements of data for both confirmed cases of infection and deaths, the consistency of our approach is sustained.",

Indeed, one may hypothesize that human species reacts to this novel virus in a nearly homogeneous way worldwide. The consistency of the model with measurements is a valid test of this hypothesis. Thus, D(t) results a crucial estimator to take early measures to contain the expansion of the pandemic. Moreover, D(t) is a robust quantifier of the pandemic's toll.

While a self-similar expansion (a power-law behavior) would be independent of that choice, we need to rely on physical similarity with known phenomena, for example the exponential quenching of a homogeneous flame in a domain under total containment. This approach is compatible with SIR and SEIR models found in the recent literature for this phenomenon 1;7;8;2;3 when the appropriate leading characteristic times are identified. In this case, the time of infectivity T L should be equal to that of the exponential decay observed in the death rate during the spread of the pandemic in China provinces after total containment measures were taken.

These are the factors that make human population a \"good combustible\" for the spreading of a virus: when an opportunistic pathogen finds its way to infect unprepared people and produce a disease in a sufficient number of individuals, its evolution is akin to that of the expansion of a flame in a combustible. The mechanisms by which the flame expands in space are intrinsically related to its dimensional character. In each dimension, the flame propagates at a constant speed (i.e., the space traveled would be proportional to t) whenever it finds a combustible with homogeneous properties along its way. For example, the area of a forest burned by a wildfire is proportional to t 2 , while the volume burned by a spark in a homogeneous mixture of fuel and oxidant is proportional to t 3 . However, when humans are exposed to an initially localized pathogen (e.g. the SARS-CoV-2), human society can be considered a nearly homogeneous network (which does it not imply a spatial homogeneity) for the propagation of a signal like the virus infection. To do this, we assume that the majority of the infection process takes place in cities, where human population is concentrated. In reality, humans behave roughly similarly in cities, which is the most populated geographical form of current human ecosystems, nearly independently of the culture. Moreover, humans interact with others at a rate that can be considered much more homogeneous than the spatial concentration of population itself. In fact, among other activities, humans move in ample spaces, seek for food from and visit toilets on a relatively homogeneous daily basis, either sharing fluids or leaving biological residues around them at the immediate reach of others in solid surfaces, in liquids, and airborne (aerosols). In other words, the human network is not a three dimensional volume of more or less static points (persons), but a relatively homogeneous fractal network where a physical signal can propagate following principles of self similarity 9;10 . Depending on the ability of the pathogen to find receptors in the host (the ease of contagion), this macroscopic network may exhibit different fractal dimensions.

This gives us the values of t d . We observe that the values of m producing a prefactor of the order unity can be considered homogeneous, an observation supported by including Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland as additional representatives of free expansion. Asian countries like Korea and two Chinese provinces are also included to illustrate the effect of containment. This demands that both C(t) and D(t) should behave in the same way, thus obeying the same non-dimensional behavior once the appropriate delay times are found for each variable C(t) and D(t), and for each country. Measurements are plotted in figure 2. The resulting mortality ratios m should not be confused with the daily mortality rates D(t)/C(t) since the delay times t d for D(t) and C(t) series are different. * * We propose that m represents a best estimator of the final mortality rate (i.e., D(t f inal )/C(t f inal ) when both C(t) and D(t) reach a plateau after measures to contain the pandemic are enacted. In fact, we hypothesize that D(t f inal )/(mC(t f inal ) = \u03b3m, where \u03b3 > 1. Indeed, if we assume that the relative number of tests made (i.e., the number of tests made in relation with the size of the real infected population) increase linearly with time, then the final value of the mortality rate measured (i.e. \u03b3m) will be about twice the average m along the curve. Then we have \u03b3 = 2 and m = (D(t f inal )/(2C(t f inal ))) 1/2 . The case of Hubei is probably the best for trying this hypothesis. The optimum value of m for Hubei is around 0.15, while the final mortality rate D(t f inal )/C(t f inal ) has resulted 0.046. Then, m = 0.15. The final asymptota of D(t)/ (mC(t)) results approximately equal to 0.28, which is indeed close to 2m = 0.3. This serves to additionally support the robustness of the hypotheses made to support the physics behind the model.",

            "text": "In figure 3 , we plot the values of t c and t d found for our selection of countries with highest impact of COVID-19. Time delay of confinement after free expansion. The characteristic time of infection T L A fundamental observation that can be made upon the collapse of the time series is the existence of a close relationship between the delay between t c and the day t measures when containment measures are enacted, and the time when both C(t) and D(t) curves exhibit a final plateau. This secondary process is what we hypothesize as a quenching of the pandemic with an initial inertia that should exhibit a characteristic decay rate. The characteristic time of the problem, i.e. the time of infection, should necessarily surface in the observed behavior of both C(t) and D(t) in this secondary process. However, the robustness of mortality D(t) as a direct descriptor of the products of the pandemic (i.e. the \"combustion\") suggest to work with these series. Thus, we represent y = (t 90% \u2212 t measures )/T 0 versus \u2206\u03c4 = (t measures \u2212 t d )/T 0 and seek for its possible relationship, where t 90% a representative final time: the time value when 90% of the long term death toll is reached in the series. Fortunately, we have complete series with a sufficiently long asymptota to al lest make linear estimations. The value of T 0 which makes the data fit to the simplest form y = 1 + A\u2206\u03c4 is T 0 = 20.1. Remarkably, measurements yield A = 1 taking this value of T 0 too. Thus, we take this as the time of infection T L used in the whole analysis. Here, T 90% is the time required to reach a 90% of the plateau from the day when total containment measures were taken. T L is made equal to 20.1 days to get y = 1 + \u2206\u03c4",

The observed accuracy of our self-similarity model to fit both the data of confirmed cases and the deaths supports the hypothesized statistically homogeneity of main properties of the human network worldwide. Taking advantage of this, our self similarity model leads to a simple way to calculate the most probable death toll at the end of a sufficiently long confinement after measures are enacted. Since final mortality would be proportional to the true population of infected people at the time of enacting measures, our previously validated hypotheses also support that the final mortality under containment will be proportional to C(t measures \u2212 t c ). Fitting the data of the global experiment of China, our model yields the following formula for the expected average deaths toll D T : D T = 8 \u00d7 10 4 (log (\u03b2 + exp ((t measures \u2212 t c )/T L ))) \u03b1",
