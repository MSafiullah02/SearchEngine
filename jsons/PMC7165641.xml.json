Over 200 viruses belonging to 27 viral families have been isolated or detected in bats; however, bat\u2013human transmission has only been observed for 11 viruses, belonging to four different viral families: Rhabdoviridae, Filoviridae, Coronaviridae and Paramyxoviridae (Allocati et al., 2016). Some examples of those viruses are as follows: SARS\u2010related coronavirus, Sosuga rubulavirus, Ebola virus and Marburg virus, rabies lyssavirus, Nipah henipavirus and Hendra henipavirus (Allocati et al., 2016; Calisher, Childs, Field, Holmes, & Schountz, 2006; Hayman, 2016; O'Shea et al., 2014; Plowright et al., 2015).",

Luis et al. (2015) analyse viral networks between rodents and bats at global scale identifying several ecology factors to explain virus\u2013host associations. Recently, works explored the specificity and frequency of sharing DNA and RNA viruses among Carnivores and bats (Wells, Morand, Wardeh, & Baylis, 2018) and the importance of the phylogeny to explain the viral richness associated with bats and rodents (Guy, Thiagavel, Mideo, & Ratcliffe, 2019).

Several different distinctive features of bats have been hypothesized to explain their particularly high viral richness, such as their ability to fly, long migrations, high trophic diversity and social structure (Brook & Dobson, 2015; Moratelli & Calisher, 2015). However, currently the viral diversity and connectivity among different species of bats are not well understood (Moratelli & Calisher, 2015; O'Shea et al., 2014) making it difficult to evaluate the implications of those relationships for emerging and re\u2010emerging zoonoses. While the literature does explain why bats harbour a particularly high number of viruses, it does not describe viral associations at the level of host species or describe direct relationships (only associations), does not address the whole viral species complex and does not describe the statistics or metrics that characterize the associations.",

The parameter \u201cbetweenness\u201d can be used to recognize dispersing hosts and key viruses in the evolution or viral transmission (Opsahl et al., 2010; White et al., 2017), while \u201ccloseness\u201d can indicate hosts and viruses that may have little direct connectivity but are surrounded by important highly connected nodes (Opsahl et al., 2010; White et al., 2017). In terms of disease ecology, we can employ these and other parameters to explore the host\u2013host, virus\u2013host and virus\u2013virus interactions by collapsing the networks and identifying communities. Network analysis thus offers the opportunity to recognize highly diverse viruses and hosts based on a high degree of connectedness. Bats and rodents are excellent taxa in which to implement this tool because they harbour a large number of highly adaptable viruses and hosts with high resistance.",

In the case of Coronaviridae and Paramyxoviridae families, we assigned as bat coronavirus and bat Paramyxovirus all unclassified coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses. Because bat astrovirus does not exist in the ICTV classification, we assigned all reports from Astroviridae family as astrovirus. To increase the certainty of identification of the viruses, only studies that used molecular methods to detect viruses were included in the database we compiled. Subsequently, each of the viruses identified in rodents or bats was classified as direct zoonotic or non\u2010zoonotic pathogens (Allocati et al., 2016; Calisher et al., 2006; Han et al., 2015).",

In other words, each bat species on average interacts with nearly two viruses and vice versa, while in rodents, on average there is a near one\u2010to\u2010one host\u2013virus interaction, leading to the rodent network having more divisions. This is similar to results found by Luis et al. (2015) when building viral association networks in Rodentia and Chiroptera, who then used the centrality metrics as a response variable in a generalized linear model to determine the phylogenetic, functional and ecological characteristics that are responsible for this high connectivity in bats. This pattern of higher host diversity among bat viruses than rodent viruses has been observed in viral metacommunities using analyses at different spatial scales (Nieto\u2010Rabiela, Suz\u00e1n, Wiratsudakul, & Rico\u2010Ch\u00e1vez, 2018), and it has been suggested that this is due to their higher dispersal ability compared with rodents (Wang, Walker, & Poon, 2011). However, since studies on viruses detected in others mammals have not yet been carried out at a similarly large scale, it is not clear whether bats' level of host\u2013virus connectivity is atypically high among mammals; we can only conclude that it is higher than in rodents.",

The largest community including the human node is surrounded by three to four smaller groups in both networks. We can highlight that in the largest community where the human is embedded, the bats and rodent hosts have a high adaptability, wide distribution and low phylogenetic distinction. Also, the closest hosts to the human node are the main reservoirs of viral diseases with worldwide distribution like hantaviridae viruses, rabies\u2010related virus and dengue virus (Tables 3 and 5). However, the clusters in the bat network are four times denser compared with rodents; this makes it easier to continue sharing the viruses. In addition, they can act as virus mixers, allowing the viruses to acquire characteristics that allow them to infect other host species, including humans. In addition, the human node is more closely connected to bats. It shows that viruses are shared to a greater degree among bats as discussed earlier (Figures 3a and 5a). One plausible explanation is that many species of bats live in high\u2010density populations, with many individuals in close proximity to each other, such as in caves and roosts sites. Indeed, there are always a larger number of bat species than rodent species in a given area (Kerth, Perony, & Schweitzer, 2011).",

High connectivity facilitates viral transmission within and between species, and so, bats are expected to have higher zoonotic potential than rodents. For example, the nectarivorous bat Glossophaga soricina had the highest closeness value in the host\u2013host network despite the fact that only three viruses have been isolated in this species: bat coronavirus, bat paramyxovirus and rabies lyssavirus. This is because these three viruses have a high viral diversity and when the network is collapsed G. soricina connects directly with 155 hosts; it is the central node, even more central than humans. This suggests that this species is prone to harbour several viruses. However, we most considered the biological characteristic of the host that could prevent an efficient transmission to the human. In both the bat and rodent virus\u2013virus networks, there are some large groups that include all of the zoonotic viruses. The grouping of zoonotic viruses suggests a high capacity for mutation and adaptability to different hosts. For that reason, the viruses are shared among different hosts and thus intricate communities are presented (Woolhouse, 2001). In bats, these clusters are disordered and close together resulting in a broad viral exchange among bats. In contrast, a closer relationship was observed in rodent viral\u2013viral network indicating smaller groups around zoonotic viruses. It is difficult though to compare our virus\u2013virus network with other works, since most studies focus on hosts. Moreover, we faced a lack of knowledge on the organization of the viral communities, assembly rules, co\u2010occurrences or even cross\u2010antigenicity. These issues directly affect our network architectures. For that reason, deeper comprehension is required to unravel this entanglement.",

This host species thus is likely less important in public health terms, but highly relevant for disease ecology. In addition, two zoonotic viruses are included in the community 5, and while they can transfer their zoonotic potential to other non\u2010zoonotic viruses using M. musculus as a virus mixer, we consider this unlikely because the proportion of zoonotic viruses is low, adding the specificity of rodents' viruses and the associative characteristics founding in the rodents. Thus, the one\u2010to\u2010one virus\u2013host species relationship suggested by the node\u2010to\u2010edge ratio suggests that spillover is unlikely, though not impossible.",

Gbagroube virus should be closely monitored along with its host, Mus setulosus, found in Central Africa (Granjon, 2016).",

First, humans' enormous population and globalization push human populations to nearly everywhere on earth and greatly increases the probability of contact with innumerable organisms, resulting in the emergence of zoonotic diseases (Kock, 2014). Secondly, because zoonotic diseases have clear social implications, once detected in one species, they are much more likely to be tested for, and thus detected, in others (Oliver\u2010Morales & Abarca Garc\u00eda, 2016). It is therefore possible that the high apparent importance of humans in the networks is more due to the over\u2010representation of zoonotic viruses in the literature than to humans actually being particularly highly.",

In addition, there are associations that could occur but do not, but these cannot be identified because cases in which viruses were tested for and not detected are not often reported. We therefore think it is important to report negative samples and the number of animals tested in meticulous reports.",

Fruit bat parvovirus in bats and Gbagroube virus in rodents should be monitored to elucidate their zoonotic potential. In the present study, we only assessed their network proximity to humans and other zoonotic viruses, and molecular genetic approaches may help to confirm our results. Counting the number of zoonotic symbionts associated with each order is not a conclusive estimate of their zoonotic potential. Our findings reveal that viruses were more frequently shared among bats than rodents. For that reason, bats have more zoonotic potential that the rodents.
