            "text": "Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) was discovered in 2005 by large scale sequencing in nasopharyngeal aspirates from young children (Allander et al., 2005). It is a respiratory virus associated with acute respiratory tract infections in young children (Allander et al., 2007, Brodzinski and Ruddy, 2009, Don et al., 2010, Garcia-Garcia et al., 2010, Gendrel et al., 2007, Jartti et al., 2011, Kahn, 2008, Proenca-Modena et al., 2011, Schildgen et al., 2008). Acute respiratory tract infection is one of the leading causes of hospitalization of young children in developed countries (Brodzinski and Ruddy, 2009, Lopez et al., 2006, Shay et al., 1999). HBoV1 infection shows frequently persistence and co-infections with other respiratory viruses (Jartti et al., 2011, Kesebir et al., 2006, Manning et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2010). However, acute HBoV1 infection, diagnosed by a high virus load in respiratory samples, viremia, detection of HBoV1-specific IgM, or an increase in the levels of HBoV1-specific IgG antibodies, and detection of HBoV1 mRNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates, results in respiratory illness (Allander et al., 2007, Christensen et al., 2010, Christensen et al., 2013, Deng et al., 2012, Don et al., 2010, Kantola et al., 2008, Nascimento-Carvalho et al., 2012, Soderlund-Venermo et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2010). Life-threatening HBoV1 infections in pediatric patients, which were associated with high virus loads or diagnostic HBoV1-specific antibodies (Edner et al., 2011, Korner et al., 2011, Ursic et al., 2011), have also been described. Moreover, a recent longitudinal study in children (from infants to puberty) documented a clear association between acute primary HBoV1 infection and respiratory symptoms (Meriluoto et al., 2012).",

Although respiratory DNA viruses have been reported to infect HAE, they infect HAE only from the basolateral surface, e.g., adenovirus (Zabner et al., 1997). In 2008, Dijkman et al. demonstrated that HBoV1 infects apically and replicates in HAE made in house (Dijkman et al., 2009). In 2012, an infectious clone of HBoV1 was established, which generates HBoV1 progeny virions from HEK293 cells transfected with this clone. Moreover, these HBoV1 virions infected HAE made in house productively, from the apical surface (Huang et al., 2012) as well as from the basolateral surface (Deng et al., 2013), which leads to airway epithelial damage.",

Previous studies have identified the presence of episomal covalently closed circular (ccc) viral DNA in patients infected with HBoV1-3 (Kang et al., 2009, Kapoor et al., 2011, Windisch et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2012). However, whether the cccDNA is the viral genomes persisting in HBoV1-infected EpiAirway HAE awaits further investigation, which will reveal mechanisms underlying HBoV1 persistent infection. The TEER of airway epithelium often indicates the extent of polarization and was used as a quality control of polarized HAE cultures from the manufacturers. Previously, primary B-HAE cultures made in house was used, which have a TEER of >1000 \u03a9 cm2 (Huang et al., 2012). However, both MucilAir and EpiAirway HAE had a low TEER (400 and 800 \u03a9 cm2, respectively) when we received them. Nevertheless, HBoV1 infection disrupts the polarity of both the MucilAir and EpiAirway HAE cultures infected with HBoV1. The TEER of the infected MucilAir and EpiAirway HAE decreased by 2- to 3-fold, similar to the decrease in TEER in HBoV1-infected HAE made in house (Deng et al., 2013). Notably, in the HAE cultures we tested, there was a higher expression level of cilia in MucilAir HAE than in EpiAirway HAE (Fig. 2, Fig. 4, compare the \u03b2-tubulin). Apparently, the high expression level of cilia did not contribute a high level of virus production from infected MucilAir HAE. Interestingly, by the end of infection, all the cilia in the infected HAE of both types were lost, although only one third of the cells showed NS1 expression, suggesting that HBoV1 infection may release cytotoxic cytokines into the cultures as do RNA respiratory viruses (Vareille et al., 2011), which warrants further investigation.",

Two sources of HAE cultures, MucilAir and EpiAirway HAE, are commercially available for productive HBoV1 infection, which will facilitate the study of HBoV1 worldwide. More importantly, the airway barrier function was destroyed in both HBoV1-infected MucilAir and EpiAirway HAE. For the first time, HBoV1 infection was demonstrated to be persistent, for as long as 50 days p.i., in an in vitro model of human airway epithelia.",
