            "text": "Orally administered bovine natural interferon (IFN) is a viable candidate therapeutic agent for the control of viral diseases of livestock. Years of experience with therapeutic effects of human IFN\u03b1 (HuIFN\u03b1) administered orally to livestock and companion animals indicate that oral HuIFN\u03b1 is safe and efficacious (Cummins et al., 1988, Cummins et al., 2005, Young and Cummins, 1990, Cummins and Stewart, 1991, Georgiades, 1993, Fulton et al., 1993, Georgiades and Fleischmann, 1996, Moore et al., 1996, Moore et al., 2004, Amadori et al., 2002). The mechanisms of action for the well-documented systemic beneficial effects of orally administered IFN are still not understood, although it has been shown that contact with the oral cavity amplifies the IFN-mediated therapeutic effects via interactions with mononuclear cells in the oral-pharyngeal mucosa (Eid et al., 1999, Tovey and Maury, 1999, Tovey et al., 2000, Tovey et al., 2003, Dron et al., 2001). Studies of the action of IFN\u2013stimulated genes (ISGs) and their protein products have resulted in fundamental discoveries relevant to translational control, regulation of RNA stability and editing, and protein transport and turnover. The antiviral and cellular actions of selected potent ISGs are part of critical pathways of antiviral actions, and thus are critical to improved clinical application of IFN (Borden and Williams, 2011). The proteins encoded by ISGs individually degrade various viral RNAs, block viral transcription, inhibit translation and/or modify protein assembly steps for viral replication and release (Borden and Williams, 2011). ISGs are up-regulated in humans within a few hours after oral HuIFN\u03b1 administration (Brod et al., 1999, Smith et al., 1999). In another study in cattle, cDNA microarray technology was used to help identify appropriate targets for therapeutic intervention with HuIFN\u03b1. Calves were given a low dose (200 units) of HuIFN\u03b1 orally once daily for 5 days, and microarray analysis was performed on 8,329 genes (Namangala et al., 2006). The authors identified the profile of more than 6000 genes altered 4 h after the final oral dose of IFN. The majority of the genes had <2 fold degree of change but 8.5% had at least a 4-fold increase in expression. Low-dose oral HuIFN\u03b1 at 200 units suppressed the expression of about 5% of the 6000 genes that were altered. In 15.5% of altered genes tested, oral HuIFN\u03b1 altered expression of genes associated with innate immunity, antigen presentation, lymphocyte activation, immune modulation, blood coagulation, hematopoiesis and apoptosis. Non-immunologic functions were represented in 84.5% of altered genes tested (Namangala et al., 2006). The authors commented that \u201cthe observed repression of about 5% of the gene transcripts shows the pleiotropic nature of IFN, stimulating some genes while suppressing others.\u201d It is thus reasonable to hypothesize that oral low-dose bovine IFN is capable of altering the same gene groups affected with low-dose oral HuIFN\u03b1. The purpose of the present study was to determine if low-dose oral bovine IFN would have beneficial biological effects on bovine immune response gene expression. In the cattle study reported herein, the expression of 92 immune response-related genes was analyzed. The mode of action of oral IFN on gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was evaluated further by assessment of IFN effects on families of genes in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction pathway.",

The bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 nano kit, 5067/1511; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), is an automated bio-analytical device using microfluidics technology that provides electrophoretic separations in an automated and reproducible manner. Tiny amounts of RNA samples are separated in the channels of the microfabricated chips according to their molecular weights and subsequently detected via laser-induced fluorescence. The result is visualized as an electropherogram in which the amount of measured fluorescence correlates with the amount of RNA of a given size (Imbeaud et al., 2005).",

Using the Bos taurus genome as the baseline or background control, the 21 down-regulated (50 units, 8 h) genes were analyzed with the functional annotation tool of DAVID. Two major functional categories were identified by DAVID enrichment analysis: Receptor protein genes (nine), and glycoprotein receptor genes (ten).

Moreover, this effect was systemic in that changes in gene expression were detected in PBMCs, which are not directly associated with the IFN-treated oral mucosa. Seven down-regulated and five up-regulated genes/gene products modulated by 50 and 200 units of orally administered IFN were shown to be part of the same KEGG pathway for cytokine and cytokine receptor interactions that are critical for the early recognition and response phases of innate and adaptive immunity. The IFN-responsive genes/gene products belong to different families of genes/products within this KEGG pathway. The effects of oral IFN on the expression of the specific cytokine/cytokine interaction genes identified in these studies merit further investigation. One concern involved the up-regulation by IFN of IL10 and IL10R. These two genes encode a cytokine and cytokine receptor, respectively, known to have Th2-type (anti-inflammatory) effects, whereas IFN, notably IFN-gamma, is thought to favor Th1-type immune responses (Kidd, 2003). Treatment of the IFN at pH 2.0 inactivated IFN-gamma and IFN-beta. However, the IFN (type I, alpha) used in these studies can have pleiotropic biological activities, including antiviral activity, antiproliferative effects, and stimulation of cytotoxic activity (Pestka, 1997, Pestka et al., 2004). In fact, type I IFN-induced production of IL-10 and its receptor has been reported in the literature (Piazzolla et al., 2000, Levings et al., 2001, Corre et al., 2013, Touzot et al., 2015). These data suggest that subspecies of IFN present in the existing formulation is/are affecting IL10 and IL10R gene expression.",

            "text": "FMDV, a viral pathogen of ruminants and swine, is an icosahedral 25\u201330 nm single-stranded RNA virus, genus Aphtovirus, family Picornaviridae. Among more than 60 distinct strains, 7 serotypes are recognized (O, A, C, Asia-1 and South African Territories (SAT) 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3). The prevalence of serotypes/strains varies by geographic region; FMDV type O is the most prevalent. Depending upon the strain and species affected, morbidity may reach 100%; mortality in adults is typically less than 1%. Young animals develop FMDV-associated myocarditis and endocarditis and are more likely to die from the direct effects of FMDV infection (Alexandersen et al., 2003, Grubman and Baxt, 2004). Cattle typically present with fever, anorexia, and reduction in milk production; excessive salvation is often seen. Vesicular lesions develop on mucous membranes, interdigital spaces, and coronary bands within two to three days after infection. In swine, vesicular lesions develop on coronary bands and may also be found on snout, udder, hock and elbow. Smaller ungulates (sheep and goats) develop mild vesicles in the oral cavity, bulbs of the heel and coronary bands (Alexandersen et al., 2003). Vesicles containing infectious virions rupture one to two days after formation, which facilitates spread of the infection to other animals and contamination of the environment. There is particular concern about FMDV because of its potential adverse economic impact upon livestock production and also because of embargos that will be placed upon US and Canadian meat products prepared for export should FMD occur in North America. The last FMD outbreak in the US was in 1929 and the last outbreak in Canada was in 1951 (Fenner et al., 1987). However, several recent FMDV outbreaks have occurred outside the US (OIE, 2015) and, like recent experiences with novel swine coronaviruses (Stevenson et al., 2013), could easily reach North America. While serotype-specific vaccination(s) can control FMDV, not all strains within a serotype are responsive to vaccinations and new FMDV strains may emerge by mutation(s) (USDA, 2013). Thus, FMDV control and containment time may be lost while strain-specific vaccine(s) are produced, distributed and then administered to susceptible livestock. Accordingly, an effective antiviral therapeutic agent would be useful for controlling FMDV outbreaks until vaccines are available. It is known that FMDV is inhibited by IFN (Richmond and Hamilton, 1969, Richmond and Campbell, 1973). Conversely, as a part of its intracellular replication strategy, FMDV is known to inhibit production of intracellular IFN-alpha/beta (\u03b1/\u03b2) (Chinsangaram et al., 1999) and, via its double-stranded (ds) RNA viral intermediate, block intracellular dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), a central intracellular IFN-inducible antiviral pathway (Chinsangaram et al., 2001). A stable resistance-related calcium binding protein (sorcin) interacts with FMDV VP1 protein to inhibit the type I IFN response (Li et al., 2013). Thus, induction of endogenous IFN or treatment with exogenous IFN could help control FMDV under field conditions by providing IFN otherwise blocked by blocked by FMDV anti-IFN mechanisms. Both infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) herpesvirus and coital vesicular exanthema viruses inhibit FMDV infections by IFN induction (Straub and Ahl, 1976). Similarly, synthetic IFN inducers (Poly I:C and/or ICLC) inhibit FMDV in animal models of FMDV infection (Richmond and Hamilton, 1969, Richmond and Campbell, 1973) and FMDV in pigs (Cunliffe et al., 1977, Dias et al., 2012, Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2014). A related IFN induction strategy is use of recombinant replication-defective viruses containing IFN production genes within the viral genome (Chinsangaram et al., 2003, Wu et al., 2003, Moraes et al., 2003, Dias et al., 2011, Dias et al., 2012, Perez-Martin et al., 2012). Some chemical IFN inducers are too toxic to be useful in the management of FMDV in livestock (McVicar et al., 1973, Cunliffe et al., 1977) but Poly ICLC and Poly I:C are reported to be effective adjuvants for FMDV vaccines (Cao et al., 2013, Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2014). Regardless, toxicity is not a factor with viral IFN induction (McVicar et al., 1974).",

Furthermore, studies note that IFN induction may also regulate expression of immunoregulatory-, cytokine-, chemokine- and IFN-stimulated genes that contribute to preventing or decreasing the duration and severity of FMDV infections and FMDV shedding into the environment (de los Santos et al., 2012, Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2013).",

Based on the data from this study, benefits occur within 8 h and not days (as in the case of viral inducers) to be effective. The IFNs are now widely available in purified form as both naturally-occurring and also as purified recombinant molecules. An important attribute of the IFN family is that, aside from IFN gamma, the other IFNs, particularly IFN\u03b1, are not species-specific in their biological actions but rather are variably species-restricted, presumably because the cellular receptors for IFN\u03b1 subfamilies are largely conserved across species. For example, human cells are responsive to animal-origin IFN and many animal cells are responsive to natural or recombinant HuIFN\u03b1 (Cummins et al., 1999a). Bovine-origin IFN\u03b1 is active in vitro on primate (Tovey et al., 1977), porcine (Carter et al., 1979, Gressor et al., 1974) and human cell cultures (Gressor et al., 1974, Carter, 1979). Porcine IFN\u03b1 is active on equine, bovine and human cell cultures (Carter, 1979, Carter et al., 1979). HuIFN\u03b1 is active on porcine, bovine (Gressor et al., 1974, Carter, 1979, Carter et al., 1979, Branca, 1986, Meister et al., 1986, Chambers et al., 1990, Pestka, 1997), and feline (Desmyter and Stewart, 1976) cell cultures.",

Available data suggests that orally administered IFN\u03b1 is bound to the tonsils and associated lymphoid and dendritic cell aggregates in the oral and pharyngeal cavity (Beilharz et al., 1997). From here, a cascade of secondary cytokine and chemokine signals are released which have pleiotropic systemic effects. For example, IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 given orally up-regulates antiviral Mx gene activity in the murine splenocytes and human PBMCs (Brod et al., 1999). Two-prime-five-prime (2\u20325\u2032) adenylate synthetase (AS), a well-characterized inducible intracellular enzyme in the IFN-induction pathway (Johnson et al., 1980) is activated systemically, not just in the oral cavities of mice and guinea pigs given oral IFN (Satoh et al., 1999). Other human (Smith et al., 1999) and murine (Eid et al., 1999, Tovey et al., 2000, Tovey et al., 2003, Dron et al., 2001) genes are also up-regulated by orally or oronasally administered murine IFN.",

Moreover, this effect was systemic in that changes in gene expression were detected in PBMCs, which are remote to the oral mucosa. It is not yet known if the down-regulation of genes at 50 units and up-regulation of genes at 200 units represent a biphasic dose response, or if the gene expression effects are temporal in nature. A similar study employing the two doses with samples being collected at multiple time points between 0 and 8 h could yield more information on this matter. The results also show little effects of IFN on gene expression in samples collected at 24 h (i.e., 16 h after a second IFN dose administered at 8 h). It is not known, however, whether the second dose of IFN was ineffective, as samples were not collected to match with the 8-h time point used for sample collection after the first dose. Other studies note relatively rapid effects of oral dosing. ISGs were up-regulated in humans within a few hours after oral HuIFN\u03b1 administration (Brod et al., 1999, Smith et al., 1999). A 15 kDa ISG protein was up-regulated in human buccal epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro, with peak levels of ISG-15 occurring two hours after oral HuIFN\u03b1 exposure (Smith et al., 1999). In short, the data suggest that the dose of IFN is critical for modulating gene expression and that there is a relatively narrow window for therapeutic effectiveness. Thus, it becomes important to ascertain whether the dose of oral IFN supplied to cattle in water or feed to cattle can be adequately controlled.",

Given in the feed or water, IFN may be a fast and inexpensive aid in FMD control. Because the effects of oral IFN were manifested strongly by 8 but not 16 h after treatment, it will probably be necessary to provide IFN in feed or water 2 or more times per day. The livestock industry has a history of adapting to any new useful technology. Automatic systems for the production of balanced rations for animals and food production consumption are in wide use for delivery of micro-ingredients (amino acids, mycotoxin binders, organic acids, vitamins and trace minerals) into batching processes to improve accuracy of delivery of micro-ingredients to increase efficiency of production. These systems are used widely in manufacturing many beef, dairy, swine and poultry feeds. The system is operated by a control unit that delivers specified amounts/types of micro-ingredients (milligrams or micrograms per head per day) by weighing the premix of the product into the ration based on intake in PPMs. Different micro-machines are approved by FDA for mixing FDA-approved drugs for disease or improvement of animal efficiency. It would be a simple matter to determine if the expected feed intake per animal can be balanced with an effective dose of IFN. Automated delivery trials for IFN have already been tested. One study delivered HuIFN\u03b1 in hog feed to control porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (Amadori et al., 2002). Other studies have used water to deliver IFN to poultry, mice and fish (Fleischmann et al., 1991, Fleischmann et al., 1992, Fulton et al., 1993, Jarosinski et al., 2001, Watanuki et al., 2009).",

In the present study, it was demonstrated that oral IFN statistically modulated the expression of 12 genes within a specific KEGG pathway (cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interactions). In turn, these data suggest that low-dose oral IFN exerts systemic and largely beneficial anti-viral effects by up- or down-regulation of specific immune response genes and their products likely needed for recovery from any viral disease, including FMDV. The accumulated evidence from this and other studies suggests that adoption of orally administered bovine IFN\u03b1 or HuIFN\u03b1 as a therapeutic modality to suppress viral replication in livestock at risk for FMDV exposure is an inexpensive, easily dispensed and widely available alternative and adjunct to vaccinations for FMDV. In addition to the obvious antiviral effects of oral IFN, systemic immune modulating effects are also part of the overall beneficial responses to IFN and it is the latter that may well provide prolonged systemic beneficial effects in virus-susceptible livestock populations. The results are intended to stimulate further testing using delivery in feed or water, potentially helping the livestock industry manage viral respiratory disease and protect against an FMDV outbreak.",
