In the past quarter of a century, we have encountered the emergence of Legionnaire\u2019s disease, Lyme disease, HIV/AIDS, Ebola virus, human mad cow disease, the Nipah virus, West Nile fever and SARS, as well as resurgent adversaries such as tuberculosis, cholera, dengue fever, and malaria [1].",

On the other hand, the understanding of the spread of epidemics has become a goal in itself because, as well as possessing complex dynamics, it has a very simple natural history and, therefore, many plausible population models [6].",

However, many important epidemiological phenomena are strongly influenced by space because of the localized nature of transmission or other forms of interaction [7\u201312]. The spread of invading organisms [13, 14] is very important and recent events have focused attention on the spread of human, livestock, crop, and wildlife diseases [15\u201319]. As a result, mathematical models with time and space are useful in investigating the process of epidemic spreading. Epidemic wavefronts may be found in reaction\u2013diffusion models, which were observed in the real world, such as in the spread of the Black Death in Europe from 1347 to 1350 [20\u201322].",

Therefore, the incidence rate is assumed to be nonlinear \u03b2S\np\nI\nq without a periodic forcing which has much wider range of dynamical behaviors in comparison to bilinear incidence rate \u03b2SI. Here, \u03b2 is the force of infection or the rate of transmission. Simple case, by their own nature, cannot incorporate many of the complex biological factors.

The whole class of the spatial model is included in this parameter space. The upper part of the displayed parameter space (where is marked by IV) corresponds to systems with homogeneous equilibria, which is unconditionally stable. If this region is left via a bifurcation (Turing or Hopf), the qualitative behavior of such equilibria changes. If an equilibrium is represented by a point in the part of the parameter space, where is marked by I, it can be destabilized by a homogeneous oscillations. In Domain II, both Hopf and Turing instability occur. The equilibria that can be found in the area, where is marked by III, is stable with respect to homogeneous perturbations but loose their stability with respect to perturbations of specific wave numbers k. In this region, stationary inhomogeneous patterns can be observed. Figure 2 shows the real part of the character value of (7) as \u03b2 increases. \n\n",

The time evolution can be solved by using the Euler method. In the present paper, we set \u0394h=1, \u0394t=0.01 and M=N=200.
