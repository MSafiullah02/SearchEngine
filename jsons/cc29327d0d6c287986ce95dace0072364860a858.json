Choleraesuis) vaccine vector could be used to deliver heterologous antigens to prevent and control pig diseases. We have previously shown that a liveattenuated S. Choleraesuis vaccine candidate strain rSC0011 (\u0394P crp527 ::TT araC P BAD crp \u0394pmi-2426 \u0394relA199::araC P BAD lacI TT \u0394asdA33, \u0394, deletion, TT, terminator) delivering SaoA, a conserved surface protein in most of S. suis serotypes, provided excellent protection against S. suis challenge, but occasionally lead to morbidity (enteritidis) in vaccinated mice (approximately 1 in every 10 mice). Thus, alternated attenuation method was sought to reduce the reactogenicity of strain rSC0011. Herein, we described another recombinant attenuated S. Choleraesuis vector, rSC0012 (\u0394P fur88 :: TT araC P BAD fur \u0394pmi-2426 \u0394relA199:: araC P BAD lacI TT \u0394asdA33) with regulated delayed fur mutation to avoid inducing disease symptoms while exhibiting a high degree of immunogenicity. Results: The strain rSC0012 strain with the \u0394P fur88 ::TT araC P BAD fur mutation induced less production of inflammatory cytokines than strain rSC0011 with the \u0394P crp527 ::TT araC P BAD crp mutation in mice. When delivering the same pS-SaoA plasmid, the intraperitoneal LD 50 of rSC0012 was 18.2 times higher than that of rSC0011 in 3-week-old BALB/C mice. rSC0012 with either pS-SaoA or pYA3493 was cleared from spleen and liver tissues 7 days earlier than rSC0011 with same vectors after oral inoculation. The strain rSC0012 synthesizing SaoA induced high titers of anti-SaoA antibodies in both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in vaginal washes) sites, as well as increased level of IL-4, the facilitator of Th2-type T cell immune response in mice. The recombinant vaccine rSC0012(pS-SaoA) conferred high percentage of protection against S. suis or S. Choleraesuis challenge in BALB/C mice.",

The surface-anchored protein (Sao) is a highly conserved membrane-anchored protein and proved to be a immunogenic vaccine candidate [4] .

Several ways were used to implement this strategy (RDAS). One way is the reverse synthesis of lipopolysaccharide O-antigen by pmi mutation [7] . Another way is to replace the upstream regulatory and promoter sequences of virulence genes with a tightly regulated araC P BAD activator-promoter [8] . This strategy has been successfully used for S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi [6] [7] [8] . With this strategy, we construct a regulated delayed S.

Fur is an important regulatory protein in Salmonella. In the presence of iron, Fur acts as a repressor of iron-controlled genes and mounts an adaptive acid tolerance response [8] . Synthesis of Fur in a vaccine strain during growth confers acid tolerance and maintains iron homeostasis. A decrease of Fur synthesis in Salmonella leads to acid sensitivity and iron acquisition [9] . Curtiss et al. reported that a S. Typhimurium strain with an arabinose regulated delayed fur mutation is highly immunogenic [6] . In these consideration, an arabinose regulated delayed fur mutation (\u0394P fur88 :: TT araC P BAD fur) was introduced into a S. Choleraesuis vaccine strain with multiple preexist mutations (\u0394pmi-2426 \u0394relA199::araC P BAD lacI TT \u0394asdA33) to generate strain rSC0012.

The level of Fur synthesis decreased with arabinose dilution (Fig. 1b) . The presence of mutation \u0394relA::araC P BAD lacI TT in rSC0012(pS-SaoA) were confirmed by the increased synthesis of SaoA (Fig. 1b) due to the derepression of P trc promoter on plasmid in rSC0012, which resulted from reduced LacI production whose production was controlled by arabinose. The pmi gene encodes 6phosphomannose isomerase that interconverts fructose-6-phosphate and mannose-6-phosphatein in Salmonella [7] . Because mannose is required for O-antigen synthesis, the \u0394pmi mutation enables the strain rSC0012 to display a smooth LPS pattern in nutrient broth in the presence of mannose and a rough pattern in the absence of mannose (Fig. 1c) . The \u0394asdA mutation enables the strain rSC0012 to have an obligate requirement for DAP [14] , which can be complemented with a vector harboring the asd gene then eliminates the need for antibiotic resistance genes for plasmid maintenance [15] .

Achieving that goal will restrict unacceptable reactogenicity to avoid overexcitation of inflammatory responses, but sufficient metabolic activity should be maintained to enable the live vaccine to reach deep lymphatic tissues and induce protective immunity [20] . The development of bacterial vaccine relies on a combination of defined mutations [19, 21] . In order to enhancing the immunogenicity of vaccine strains or to disarm them, multiple independent defined mutations were introduced into Salmonella to generate new recombinant attenuated vaccine strains [6, 19, 22] . By coalescent proper mutations, vaccine strains can be befittingly designed to avoid unacceptable reactogenicity and enhanced immunogenicity [17] . Our previous live attenuated S.

The assay was performed in duplicate and repeated at least 3 times of the ways to address this problem is by incorporating a sopB mutation [5, 19] . In this paper, another way to improve the S. Choleraesuis vector was reported. Fur is an important regulatory proteins of Salmonella, which has been implicated in the acid tolerance response since fur mutants are acid sensitive and cause altered expression of several acid shock proteins [10, 23] . A S. Typhimurium strain with an arabinose regulated fur mutation is adequately attenuated and highly immunogenic [6, 12] . However, S. Typhimurium belong to group B, while S. Choleraesuis group C.

In general, the live Salmonella vaccines with RDAS display superior colonization level in lymphoid tissues during the invasion stage, leading to enhanced protection by effectively colonizing lymphoid tissues [6, 25] . However, there are do exist high levels of colonization but low immunogenicity. A strain with the regulated delayed rfc mutation exhibits superior colonization and yet does not Fig. 6 Induction of inflammatory cytokines at 6 h and 12 h post-infection in ten mice immunized with different Salmonella strains.

Thus, in addition to colonization level, other determining factors may exist to induce the enhanced protection achieved by regulated delayed attenuation. From the above, Selecting the proper mutation is critical for vaccine development with RDAS. This study confirmed above statement. Although the colonization of rSC0012(pS-SaoA) in mice was less than that of rSC0011(pS-SaoA), rSC0012(pS-SaoA) stimulated stronger serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses than the rSC0011(pS-SaoA).

It could partially be that the intracellular characteristics of Salmonella enterica cause them to be detected on the surface of APC through MHC-I molecules. This result is consistent with previous studies with S. Typhi [6] . Strain rSC0012 induced higher Th2 cell-mediated response than strain rSC0011, as aroused by the significant up-regulation of imprint Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and greater humoral responses than rSC0011 in mice. This phenomenon may be related to the secreting of heterologous antigen. The more heterologous antigens were secreted during infection, the more likely to trigger an IL-4-dominant response [27] . We found a larger secretion of the SaoA from rSC0012, which could be presented by MHC-II molecules. An additional factor may be due to an increase in acid sensitivity cause by loss of Fur makes the rSC0012 more susceptible to killing by macrophages, thus weakening rSC0012's ability to survive in macrophages. The presence of S. suis-specific IgA serves to promptly deliver the antigen to Peyer's patch dendritic cells or phagocytes and also promptly excite the adaptive immunity during secondary exposure [16] . Generally speaking, the more attenuated the vaccine strain is, the lower its immunogenicity is [17, 22] , while, the more attenuated rSC0012 strain induced significantly higher IgA and IgG antibody responses to SaoA than the rSC0011 at 3 weeks after the initial immunization in juvenile mice. This may be the result of a equilibrium between attenuation and the ability to participation immune components and activate a controlled over-inflammatory response by the finely crafted strain [19] .",
