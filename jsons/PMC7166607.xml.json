They cause a wide range of illnesses including respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, and disorders of the central nervous system in birds, humans, and other mammals [Holmes, 2001]. Based on genome sequence and serology, CoVs can be divided into three distinct groups, I, II, and III. Human CoVs (HCoVs) belong to group I and II [Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Woo et al., 2009]. The first two identified HCoVs were HCoV 229E and OC43 [Tyrrell and Bynoe, 1965; Hamre and Procknow, 1966; McIntosh et al., 1967].",

Seroepidemiological studies have shown a trend of steady increased incidence of IgG antibodies against non\u2010SARS HCoVs, with about 70% of healthy adults being detected seropositive for the virus [McIntosh et al., 1970; Shao et al., 2007; Dijkman et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2009], suggesting the wide spread of HCoV infections in human populations. However, the clinical significance of non\u2010SARS HCoV infections, in particular the novel HCoVs found recently, has not been fully addressed.",

Consensus primers targeting the RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (pol) gene, which generate an amplicon of about 440\u2010bp in size, were used to screen all HCoV infections as described previously [Woo et al., 2005].

Various HCoVs in the samples, including OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, were identified based on the alignment analysis of sequences of PCR products with the corresponding sequences of the pol gene of known HCoVs in the GenBank database, using BLAST software (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

HCoV infections were found to be responsible for 1% of all cases of acute respiratory tract infections during the study period. OC43 strain led to the most prevalent HCoV infection (0.6%), followed by 229E (0.2%), HKU1 (0.2%), and NL63 (0.1%). The prevalence of HCoV infections in this study is lower than that in previous studies, in which detection rate of HCoV ranges from 2.1% to 5.7% [Gerna et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2006; Pierangeli et al., 2007; Bellei et al., 2008; Gorse et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2009]. Several factors may account for this disparity: (1) the subjects recruited in this study were adult outpatients whereas those in other studies were mainly hospitalized children [Gerna et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2006; Pierangeli et al., 2007; Leung et al., 2009] or adults with underlying diseases [Lau et al., 2006; Bellei et al., 2008; Gorse et al., 2009]; (2) the viral infection rate from nasal and throat swabs used in this study may be lower than that of nasopharyngeal aspirates used in other studies [Lambert et al., 2008; Meerhoff et al., 2010]; and (3) differences in study time frame and geographical area [Lau et al., 2006].",

Our results for infection rates of OC43 and 229E are different from those of previous reports, which may be due to the geographic location and the alternating pattern of viral seasonality in our study. This study indicates that in China, OC43 infections peaked every other year, whereas 229E appeared every other year. Furthermore, OC43 was found mainly in summer and early autumn, and only a few cases appeared in November (winter season) 2008, whereas 229E was detected mainly in spring and summer. The seasonal distribution feature of HKU1 and NL63 infections from year to year is not very clear. As most of the previous studies covered only short periods, our understanding of the epidemiology for these subgroups is still incomplete. We found that HKU1 occurred in spring, early summer and winter, which concurred with a previous study of children in Hong Kong [Lau et al., 2006]. NL63 peaked in autumn as reported by others [Lau et al., 2006; Leung et al., 2009] but was absent in spring. Therefore, the seasonal pattern of NL63 infection appears to be similar to that of 229E. Taken together, these findings indicate that HCoV infections fluctuate by season although some HCoV subtypes such as OC43, 229E, and NL63 display biennial prevalence. However, continuous surveillance of HCoV infections over a long period is necessary to describe their temporal distribution more precisely.",

There was a higher detection rate of all HCoVs in individuals >65 years of age, with a total positive rate of 3.6% in that age group. Of note, there was a lower detection rate (0.02%) for NL63 in the 25\u201365 years age group, indicating that young adults are less affected by this strain. Because the number of patients who were positive for this virus was limited, further studies in different age groups should be carried out in the future.",

However, the clinical presentations were slightly different among OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1. In this study, vomiting was more common in 229E\u2010positive patients but not in those infected by HKU1 and NL63 strains. Sputum production was also absent in HKU1 infections. During the study period, lower respiratory tract infections were found in individuals infected by OC43, HKU1, and NL63, but not in those with 229E infections. Because all the samples were taken from outpatients and they were not screened for co\u2010detection with bacteria, an association between infection with different HCoVs and disease severity, and with different results from laboratory investigations such as peripheral blood tests, needs to be investigated further.",

By contrast, no other viruses were detected in adult patients with NL63 infections in this study, although in children with acute respiratory tract infections NL63 was co\u2010detected with other pathogens previously [Gerna et al., 2006]. Given that the number of NL63\u2010positive cases was limited in this study, further investigation would help to clarify whether the difference of co\u2010infection with other respiratory viruses in adults and children reflects the pathogenic feature of different HCoVs.",
