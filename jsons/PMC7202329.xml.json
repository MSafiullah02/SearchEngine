An aliquot was drawn for determination of the pretreatment viral infectivity titer. The spiked PLT mixture was treated with 150 \u00b5mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm2 UVA. After treatment, a sample was withdrawn for measurement of the posttreatment viral infectivity titer. Four replicate experiments (unless otherwise specified) with four independent units of SDP were performed for each virus.

In the cell culture assay, most PLT samples were first diluted with tissue culture medium and incubated at approximately 37\u00b0C for at least 1 hour to allow time for clot formation, which was then removed.

New viruses continue to emerge at a rate of one every 2 to 3 years with a potentially damaging virus transmitted through blood every 5 years.\n47\n Testing remains a reactive approach to blood safety. The new viruses must be identified before sensitive tests can be developed. Although the time to develop an assay has shortened as the technology improves, the time it takes for a new virus in the blood supply to be recognized as a threat may be significant as demonstrated by the current WNV outbreak in the United States.\n48\n Furthermore, all tests have a sensitivity threshold that can allow contaminated units to escape detection. For WNV, in spite of the institution of NAT in 2003 under an FDA\u2010approved investigational new drug application, six transfusion\u2010transmitted WNV infections were confirmed.\n49\n In addition, testing only applies to a small percentage of the organisms that may infect blood; a number of bacteria and protozoan parasites, including the agents of Lyme disease, babesiosis, malaria, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis, are known to be transmitted by blood transfusion, but no routine testing has been implemented in Europe or the United States.",

In a recent article, 15 international experts expressed their opinions on whether any of the current tests on donor blood can be omitted when PCT is used.\n50\n Most do not think pathogen inactivation and testing are mutually exclusive. No current tests can be omitted until pathogen inactivation methods for all blood components are available. Suggested possible exceptions may include omission of tests for syphilis, CMV, bacterial testing for apheresis PLT concentrates, and gamma irradiation. The development of new tests for emerging pathogens may be eliminated or delayed. However, owing to the concerns of the geq titer of greater than 1010 for viruses such as B19 in the window period, the conservative approach would be to retain the most sensitive current tests to assure that levels of viremia are well below the documented pathogen inactivation effectiveness threshold.

The disposable set provides a single\u2010use, closed, integrated system for pathogen inactivation treatment of a PLT product (300 mL). The PLT product in a mixture of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent InterSol (PAS III) is connected via a sterile connection device and passed through a container of amotosalen\u2010HCl (also known as S\u201059) into an illumination container (Step 1). The integrated set is placed in the UVA illumination device that provides a 3 J per cm2 dose of UVA to the mixture (Step 2). After illumination for 3 to 6 minutes, the PLTs are transferred to a second container for treatment with a compound adsorption device (CAD) to lower the levels of residual amotosalen and free photoproducts (Step 3). After a minimum of 4 hours of CAD treatment, the PCT PLTs are transferred to a PL\u20102410 plastic container for storage up to 5 days (Step 4). The CAD step was not used in the viral inactivation experiments described in this report.\n",
