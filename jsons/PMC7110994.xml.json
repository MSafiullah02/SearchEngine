These two membrane inversions allow exosomes to present trans membrane cargo in the same orientation relative to the cytoplasm as at the plasma membrane [7], [8]. One inversion occurs at the plasma membrane during endocytic internalization as the plasma membrane invaginates prior to budding off. The second inversion occurs as the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) bud off into the lumen of the late endosome (Fig. 2a).",

Of particular interest are tumor cells that exhibit enhanced production of exosomes. The mechanism or need for such enhanced production of exosomes is not understood but may indicate a role for exosomes in tumor development [10]. Since exosome production is a continuous cell function, certain cell types like platelets can be treated with agonists to induce degranulation and enhanced release of microvesicles and exosomes [11]. Exosome secretion is also increased on free radical stress or UV irradiation, decreased membrane cholesterol, and increased intracellular calcium. In vivo, exosomes have been characterized in most circulating body fluids such as plasma, urine, saliva, broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and others [12], [13].",

The extent of common mRNA and miRNA content is not well established due to the limited number of global studies which have profiled both species. Online resources exist, such as the Exocarta compendium of all exosome based studies, which compile protein, mRNA, and miRNA data from different sources into a searchable format [14]. Additionally, the urinary exosome resource from the Knepper Lab at NIH also provides a detailed dataset of urine exosomal protein content (Urinary Exosome Protein Database). Augmenting this core set of components, the biology of exosomes originates from the cell type and cell condition specific cargo of protein, lipid, RNA, miRNA and DNA (Fig. 1). This dependence of biomolecular content on cell context, and variations between normal and diseased cells, has garnered much interest in exosomes as harbors of disease biomarkers which could be thought of as a \u201cfluidome\u201d or \u201cliquid biopsies\u201d where extraction of exosomes from body fluids can provide a snapshot into the donor cell condition [15]. The results obtained in such biomarker studies to date has prompted some authors to suggest that an exosome is a miniature cell in terms of healthy vs. normal status [16].",

Exosomes from APCs are similarly enriched in MHC I, MHC II, and immuno-modulatory proteins. A strong immunogenic response by dendritic cell (DC) exosomes (also known as dexosomes), generally relies on the presence of co-stimulatory molecules on the APC. However in some cases dexosomes have been shown to stimulate a sufficient immune response dependent solely on the MHC I concentration and in the absence of APCs and corresponding co-stimulatory molecules [27].

For instance, studies on tumor derived exosomes reveal that they may perform several functions aiding tumor survival and metastasis (Fig. 3a). The presence of HLA-G in exosomes secreted by melanoma cells might indicate a role in creating a tumor tolerance associated response [41]. Tolerogenic activity of exosomes has been associated with Fas- and TRAIL-expression in exosome membranes inducing FasL- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of anti-tumor T-cells [42]. Incubation with tumor derived exosomes can disrupt the maturation of differentiating CD14+ and HLA-DRlow/neg monocyte precursors into DCs [43]. The resulting lack of T-cell stimulatory effects on exosome co-culture is primarily due to the altered monocyte cytokine profile exemplified by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, interleukin IL-6, and pro-angiogenic and immuno-suppressive factors, e.g. TGF-\u03b2, IL-8 and IL-10.",

Consequently, tumor derived exosomes by their very nature support neo-angiogenesis since they are enriched in tetraspanins which enhance the secretion of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and metalloproteinases from target cells [45].

Such examples suggest that the exosomal biomarker discovery approach can be \u2018topside up\u2019 or \u2018topside down\u2019. An initial screen in conditioned media from cultured cell lines can be used to build a predictive model for pathways over or under represented in exosomes.

            "text": "Fig. 2: The biogenesis and molecular relevance of exosomes. (a) Exosomes arise from the cell\u2032s endosomal system. The plasma membrane invaginates and buds off during endocytic internalization. Cargo destined for lysosomal degradation is ubiquitinated. At the early endosome the decision to recycle or be directed to the late endosome relies on specific protein interactions and domain based sorting. The early endosome matures into a late endosomal compartment where inward budding of intralumenal vesicles (ILVs) allows the capture of cytoplasmic cargo. Distinct subsets of ILVs may target cargo for lysosomal degradation (ESCRT dependent, ceramide independent) or release cargo to the cell\u2032s exterior via exosomes. The formation of exosomes is ceramide biosynthesis dependent and relatively ESCRT independent. Exosomes retain similar membrane topology as the plasma membrane due to the two membrane inversion events. Sorting of cargo into exosomes relies on specific interactions with lipids and proteins on membrane sub-domains as well as interactions with the tetraspanin web. (b) Exosomes are internalized by cells close to the donor or originating cell (juxtacrine uptake), some distance from the donor cell (paracrine uptake) or they may spread through systemic circulation and be taken up by distant tissues (endocrine uptake). There is specificity in exosome uptake as a function of recipient cell lineage. Exosome surface markers and host cell surface markers contribute to such selectivity in uptake. Exosomes may begin protein based signaling functions even as they adhere to the host cell. Uptake of exosomes occurs primarily through phago-lysosome intermediates or utilizing specific receptors for exosomal surface proteins or the Tim-4 receptor. Once internalized, exosomal content is released via the phagolysosome or localized in the late endosome. (c) The exosomal lipid, protein, RNA, miRNA and DNA content can alter a recipient cell\u2032s molecular profile by various mechanisms which alter gene expression. Some possibilities for exosomal cargo mediated recipient cell reprogramming may include altered transcriptional or translational profile, transcript or protein modification, regulation of signaling cascades, protein localization and turnaround, key enzymatic reactions and cellular homeostasis. The source and condition of both the donor and recipient cell may determine which of these molecular mechanisms predominate. Intriguingly, exosomes may also have recipient cell type specific functions for the same molecule.

            "text": "Fig. 3: Exosomes can alter the molecular profile of their microenvironment and recipient cells and can affect tissue health. (a) Exosomes help to establish a metastatic niche to aid tumor growth and tumor metastasis. Utilizing VEGF and cytokine cargo, exosomes enhance recruitment of hematopoietic and endothelial precursor cells to enhance neo-angiogenesis in the tumor. Exosomes have also been suggested to influence planar cell polarity and the extracellular matrix to allow tumor cell mobilization. To aid tumor growth, exosomes are additionally known to trigger apoptotic reduction in anti-tumor immune cells through FasL and TNF-pathways. The growth factor and cytokine cargo helps exosomes to attract disseminated tumor cells from the primary tumor site as well as cells of the myeloid and erythropoietic lineages to the pre-metastatic niche to aid tumor spread. (b) Exosomes share many characteristics with viruses in the molecular machinery of budding from the plasma membrane. Retroviruses like HIV utilize the cell-encoded intercellular vesicle traffic as a means to protect themselves from the host cell's proteolytic system. Segregating into the exosomes during the exosome formation event, the virus is camouflaged and avoids the host surveillance system and proteolysis. The exosome encapsulated virus is furthermore able to disseminate and move between cells utilizing the exosome pathway for entering a host cell without utilizing its own fusion machinery as it searches for optimal target cells. Exosomes thus aid the trans-infection of viruses. (c) Amyloid plaques of the Alzheimer's disease afflicted brain have aggregates of amyloid beta peptide processed from amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is processed by at least three proteases termed \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-secretases, which lead to the generation of a number of proteolytic fragments, including A\u03b2 when APP is cleaved by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases. Exosomes have been found to contain APP, A\u03b2 and other proteolytic fragments of APP, \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and some components of \u03b3-secretase. It has also been suggested that exosomes from an unhealthy brain cell may cause spread of cellular insults in the form of RNA and protein to surrounding healthy cells and thus aid the spread of neurological disorders.
