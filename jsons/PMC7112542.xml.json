            "text": "Lamoids, or llamas, belong to a family of camelids which are economically important livestock and have developed complex features and immunological traits related to their habitat (Wu et al., 2014; Saadeldin et al., 2018a). The llama (Lama glama), Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus), dromedary (Camelus dromedarius) and alpaca (Vicugna pacos) differ in their habitat. The Bactrian camel and dromedary are adapted to arid-desert-adapted environments, alpacas to plateaus, and the llama to higher altitudes. Llamas are historically found in the Andean highlands, specifically the Altiplano of southeast Per\u00fa and western Bolivia, as well as in Chile and Argentina, which has the third highest population of llamas (Wu et al., 2014). The domesticated llama is closely related to two extant wild South American camelids, the vicu\u00f1a (Vicugna vicugna) and guanaco (Lama guanicoe). Previous genomic studies have revealed a range of specific adaptions in camelids relating to fat and water metabolism, osmoregulation, blood glucose level regulation, stress responses to heat, aridity, as well as to intense ultraviolet radiation and dust (Wu et al., 2014). Furthermore, a particularly important feature in camelid immunity is the production of small, homodimeric heavy chain-only, antibodies (HCAbs) which are of great value for the biomedical industry (Henry et al., 2019).",

            "text": "Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are phylogenetically conserved calcium-dependent enzymes which post-translationally convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins in an irreversible manner. This can cause functional and structural changes in target proteins (Vossenaar, 2003; Gy\u00f6rgy et al., 2006; Wang and Wang, 2013; Bicker and Thompson, 2013). Structures most prone to deimination are beta-sheets and intrinsically disordered proteins, while the position of the arginine is also important; arginines sitting next to aspartic acid residues are most prone to citrullination, arginines next to glutamic acid residues are rarely citrullinated and those flanked by proline are poorly citrullinated (Nomura, 1992; Tarcsa et al., 1996; Gy\u00f6rgy et al., 2006). Protein deimination can affect gene regulation, cause generation of neoepitopes (Witalison et al., 2015; Lange et al., 2017) and may also allow for protein moonlighting, an evolutionary acquired phenomenon facilitating proteins to exhibit several physiologically relevant functions within one polypeptide chain (Henderson and Martin, 2014; Jeffrey, 2018; Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2018a). PADs have been identified throughout phylogeny from bacteria to mammals, with 5 tissue specific PAD isozymes in mammals, 3 in chicken, 1 in bony fish and arginine deiminase homologues in bacteria (Vossenaar et al., 2003; Rebl et al., 2010; Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2018a, a; Kosgodage et al., 2019). While studies on PADs in relation to human pathophysiology, including cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases (Wang and Wang, 2013; Witalison et al., 2015; Lange et al., 2017; Kosgodage et al., 2017 & 2018) and CNS regeneration (Lange et al., 2011 and 2014) exist, relatively little phylogenetic research has been carried out on PADs in relation to normal physiology and evolutionary acquired adaptions of the immune system. Recent comparative studies focussing on roles for PADs in teleost fish have identified post-translational deimination in key proteins of innate, adaptive and mucosal immunity (Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2018a, b; Magnadottir et al., 2019a; Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2019b). A recent study in shark also revealed novel insights into this post-translational modification in relation to key immune factors, including shark immunoglobulins (Criscitiello et al., 2019). As the camelid family has developed unusual small immunoglobulins similar as to shark through convergent evolution, indicating common factors between shark and camelid immunity, we felt that an investigation of post-translationally deiminated proteins in camelids was warranted.",

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are found in most body fluids and participate in cellular communication via transfer of cargo proteins and genetic material (Inal et al., 2013; Colombo et al., 2014; Lange et al., 2017; Turchinovich et al., 2019; Vagner et al., 2019). EVs in body fluids, including serum, can also be useful biomarkers to reflect health status (Hessvik and Llorente, 2018; Ramirez et al., 2018). Previous work on EVs has hitherto mainly been in the context of human pathologies, while recently comparative studies are growing (Iliev et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2015; Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2019b; Criscitiello et al., 2019; Gavinho et al., 2019; Kosgodage et al., 2019). Few studies have been performed on EVs in camelids but therapeutic effects of EVs isolated from camel milk have been identified in halting cancer progression (Badawy et al., 2018). A recent study in shark identified for the first time deiminated small immunoglobulin proteins as part of EV cargo (Criscitiello et al., 2019). Due to the link between camelid and shark immunity through convergent evolution including the unusual immunoglobulin structure of small heavy chain-only Ig\u2019s, a comparative study on EVs and deiminated EV cargo in a camelid species may provide further insights into shared immunological traits. Camelids have an unusual Ig repertoire and a large diversity of functional nanobodies has been identified in the llama (Harmsen and De Haard, 2007; Deschaght et al., 2017). This has made camelids an important source for small immunoglobulins that can be used for immunotherapy purposes, including for tumour targeting (van Lith et al., 2016), as well as for assessing cancer metastasis (Ramos-Gomes et al., 2018). As these nanobodies can also penetrate the blood-brain barrier (\u0160irochmanov\u00e1 et al., 2018) they are of great value for a range of therapeutic treatment applications, including for brain cancers (Iqbal et al., 2010). Furthermore, as the camelid family has acquired unique metabolic features, they are also of interest as a model species for informing metabolic diseases.",

For F95 enrichment, 50 \u03bcl serum was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Merck). For EVs, total protein was first extracted from EV-enriched pellets derived from 100 \u03bcl serum, using 100 \u03bcl radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, containing protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma, UK), and shaken gently on ice for 2 h. Thereafter proteins were isolated from the EVs by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 30 min, collecting the supernatant containing the proteins. Immunoprecipitation was carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Merck), using a rotating platform overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The F95 bound proteins were eluted using denaturing elution buffer, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Merck). The F95 enriched eluates were then either analysed by Western blotting or by LC\u2014MS/MS (Cambridge Proteomics, Cambridge, UK). For LC\u2014MS/MS, the F95-enriched eluates were run 1 cm into a SDS-PAGE gel and the whole F95-enriched eluate was cut out as one band, whereafter it was processed for proteomic analysis (carried out by Cambridge Proteomics). Peak files were submitted to in-house Mascot (Matrix Science; Cambridge Proteomics). Databases used for protein identification (in house, Cambridge Proteomics) were as follows: Camelidae_family_20190613 (21429 sequences; 9086806 residues) and also specifically for llama: Lama_glama_20190613 (234 sequences; 52757 residues).",

Post-translational deimination was identified in key immune, nuclear and metabolic proteins. A llama PAD homologue was identified at an expected 70\u201375 kDa size similar as for human PADs by Western blotting via cross reaction with anti-human PAD2, PAD3 and PAD4 antibodies. PAD2 is known to be the phylogenetically most conserved PAD form (Vossenaar et al., 2003; Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2018a) and has also been seen in shark (Criscitiello et al., 2019). Deiminated histone H3, a marker of neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), was also detected in llama serum by Western blotting and is described for the first time in a camelid species but was recently described in shark (Criscitiello et al., 2019). NETosis is driven by PADs (Li et al., 2010), is conserved throughout phylogeny and is important in innate immune defences against a range of pathogens including bacteria, viruses and helminths (Brinkmann et al., 2004; Branzk et al., 2014; Sch\u00f6nrich and Raftery, 2016). NETosis has also been associated with clearance of apoptotic cells and during tissue remodelling in teleosts (Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2018a, 2019a). Furthermore, NETosis is linked to a range of autoimmune diseases, due to NET activation via neo-epitopes (O\u2019Neil and Kaplan, 2019), which can also lead to organ damage (Lee et al., 2017). NETosis is also associated with cancer (Gonzalez-Aparicio and Alfaro, 2019) and neurodegenerative diseases (Pietronigro et al., 2017).",

Using STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) analysis (https://string-db.org/) for protein-protein interaction, the PPI enrichment value for deiminated proteins in whole llama serum was found to be p <  1.0e-16 for 43 deiminated proteins out of 103 identified in serum, which indicates that these proteins have more interactions among themselves than what would be expected for a random set of proteins of similar size, drawn from the genome (STRING analysis, see Fig. 3\nA). For deiminated proteins in 29 out of the 68 deiminated EV cargo proteins, the PPI enrichment value was found to be p = 0.0193 (STRING analysis, see Fig. 4\nA). Such enrichment indicates that the proteins are at least partially biologically connected, as a group. As the camelid proteins are not present in the STRING database, corresponding protein homologues for human were chosen to create the protein-protein interaction networks shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. Out of the 103 camelid proteins identified as deiminated in serum, protein IDs for 43 were present for Homo sapiens to perform the assessment of protein-protein interactions and identification of main biological GO pathways (response to stress, response to wounding, oxygen transport, small molecule metabolic process, vesicle mediated transport and regulated exocytosis; Fig. 3B). For llama EVs, out of 68 proteins identified as deiminated, 29 corresponding protein homologues were found in the STRING database for Homo sapiens and were analysed highlighting main biological GO pathways (response to stress, cytoskeleton organisation and vesicle-mediated transport; Fig. 4B).",

In the llama the heavy chain-only antibodies are comprised of at least two subclasses (Henry et al., 2019). These types of homodimeric, light chain-less antibodies have evolved through convergent evolution (Brooks et al., 2018), in at least two groups (camelids and cartilaginous fish), and their variable binding domains (VHHS) are of great value for therapeutic and diagnostic applications (Muyldermans, 2013; Criscitiello, 2014; Steeland et al., 2016; K\u00f6nning et al., 2017; Henry et al., 2019). Nanobodies can act against challenging targets such as small molecules and toxins (Wesolowski et al., 2009; Bever et al., 2016), viruses (Wei et al., 2011; Hassiki et al., 2016; Vanlandschoot et al., 2011; Cohen, 2018), enzymes (Muyldermans, 2013), ion channels (Wei et al., 2011; Danquah et al., 2016) and G protein-coupled receptors GPCRs (Cromie et al., 2015). Llama nanobodies have been shown to tether to early endosomes and to mitochondria (Traub, 2019), be used for diagnostics (Shriver-Lake et al., 2018), be used for design of cancer immunotherapeutics (Hussack et al., 2018; Bannas and Koch-Nolte, 2018; Rossotti et al., 2019) and have been approved for passive immunotherapy (Sheridan, 2019). Our current finding, that llama nanobodies can be post-translationally deiminated may shed some light on their observed structural variation which still remains to be fully explained as sequence alignment does not fully elucidate their diversity (Mitchell and Colwell, 2018). As a structurally analogous immunoglobulin in shark, new antigen receptor (NAR) (Greenberg et al., 1995; Barelle et al., 2009; Flajnik and Dooley, 2009; De Silva et al., 2019) was recently also found to be deiminated (Criscitiello et al., 2019), our current finding may provide novel insights into function of these immune proteins and be useful for refinement in therapeutic nanobody development. Llama single-chain antibodies were here found to be deimination candidates both in llama whole serum and in serum derived EVs, highlighting also their EV-mediated export.",

Immunoglobulins (Ig) are key molecules in adaptive immunity but post-translational deimination of Ig\u2019s has hitherto received little attention. Deimination of the IgG Fc region in patients with bronchiectasis and RA has been identified (Hutchinson et al., 2017). Furthermore, deimination of Ig\u2019s in teleost fish was recently described (Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2019a), as well as in shark (Criscitiello et al., 2019). Given the increased focus on understanding of Ig diversity throughout phylogeny (Smith et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; de los Rios et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016, 2017; Stanfield et al., 2018) and the unique features of camelid immunoglobulins (Plasil et al., 2019), our current finding of deimination of llama Ig\u2019s highlights a novel concept that may further understanding of Ig diversity throughout evolution. Of additional interest is the finding that some deiminated Ig proteins were also found to be exported in EVs.",

            "text": "\nComplement components identified to be deiminated in llama serum included C3, C4 and C1q, while only C3 was identified to be deiminated in serum derived EVs. Complement component C3 plays a central role in all pathways of complement activation and can also be directly activated by self- and non-self surfaces via the alternative pathway without a recognition molecule (Dodds and Law, 1998; Dodds, 2002). In camelids, the alternative and classical pathway haemolytic activity of serum has been assessed in the dromedary camel with respect to age and gender (Olaho-Mukani et al., 1995a; and 1995b). Hitherto little is known about roles for post-translational deimination of complement components throughout phylogeny. In teleost fish, C3 has been identified in serum in deiminated form (Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2019a) and also found to be deiminated in mucosal and serum EVs of teleost fish (Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2019b, 2019c), while post-translationally deiminated C3 was identified in shark total serum but not EVs (Criscitiello et al., 2019). Other complement components, including C4 and C1q, which belong to the classical pathway of complement activation were here identified as deiminated in llama whole serum and some of those have also recently been reported to be deiminated in teleost fish (Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2019a). The C1q subcomponent can bind to the Fc region of immunoglobulins that are bound to antigen and activate the classical part of the complement pathway (Reid et al., 2002; Reid, 2018). Interestingly, an essential role for arginine in C1q has previously been suggested for C1q-IgG interaction (Kojouharova et al., 2004). C1q also serves as a potent pattern recognition molecule which recognises self, non-self and altered self-signals (Nayak et al., 2012; Reid, 2018) and may therefore also bind to deiminated neo-epitopes (Magnad\u00f3ttir et al., 2019a). The complement system has multifaceted roles. It forms part of the first line of immune defence against invading pathogens, acting in clearance of necrotic or apoptotic cells (Dodds and Law, 1998; Sunyer and Lambris, 1998; Fishelson et al., 2001; Carroll and Sim, 2011). Complement also has roles in regeneration (Del Rio-Tsonis et al., 1998; Haynes et al., 2013) and tissue remodelling (Lange et al., 2004a, 2004b; Lange et al., 2005, 2006, 2019). Furthermore, C1 is also implicated in multiple non-complement functions including binding of apoptotic cells, cleavage of nuclear antigens and cleavage of MHC class I (Lu and Kishore, 2017). Post-translational deimination of complement components may possibly influence their function including cleavage ability, binding, deposition and generation of the convertase.",

Hsp90 is a phylogenetically highly conserved chaperone protein involved in protein folding, stabilisation of proteins against heat stress, and aids in protein degradation (Buchner, 1999; Picard, 2002). Hsp90 also stabilizes a number of proteins required for tumour growth and is therefore important in anti-cancer drug investigations (Goetz et al., 2003). Hsp90 is responsible for most of the ATPase activity of the proteasome (Imai et al., 2003) and has an ATP binding region, which also is the main binding site of drugs (Chiosis et al., 2006). In camelids, Hsp90 has been related to adaptive tolerance of camel somatic cells to acute and chronic heat shock (up to 20 h at 45 degrees Celsius), which is lethal to many mammalian cells (Saadeldin et al., 2018b). Hsp90 has previously been described to be post-translationally deiminated in rheumatoid arthritis, allowing deimination-induced shifts in protein structure to generate cryptic epitopes capable of bypassing B cell tolerance (Travers et al., 2016). It is of some interest to find that Hsp90 is also found deiminated in llama serum, further highlighting protein moonlighting functions of Hsp90 in physiological and pathophysiological context via post-translational deimination. In addition, finding post-translational deimination of the same protein throughout phylogeny also supports translational value between species to further understanding of this post-translational modification in human pathologies.",

            "text": "\nAdiponectin is the most abundant secreted adipokine with pleiotrophic roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes (Fiaschi, 2019). It has received considerable interest in the field of metabolic and obesity research (Frankenberg et al., 2017; Spracklen et al., 2019), as well as in diabetes (Yamauchi et al., 2003), due to its key function in regulating glucose (Yamauchi et al., 2002). Adiponectin is furthermore linked to longevity (Chen et al., 2019a, 2019b), regenerative functions (Fiaschi et al., 2014) and has roles in myopathies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and collagen VI-related myopathies (Gamberi et al., 2019). Adiponectin is also implicated in a range of cancers, often in relation to obesity (Parida et al., 2019). Furthermore, adiponectin plays roles in reproduction, embryo pre-implantation and embryonic development (Barbe et al., 2019). Due to the range of functions in relation to key pathophysiologies there is great interest in drug development for modulating adiponectin signalling (Fiaschi, 2019). Given the unique metabolic adaptive features of camelids, the identification of post-translational deimination of this key metabolic protein may be of some interest. Recent studies in rheumatoid arthritis made a correlation between inflammation, autoantibodies and adiponectin levels (Hughes-Austin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019), while adiponectin itself has not been previously identified to be deiminated to our knowledge. Post-translational deimination may be a hitherto unrecognized mechanism for adiponectin, also in humans, to adapt moonlighting functions via changes in protein folding and therefore interaction with other proteins. Adiponectin is a small 244 aa protein (NP_001171271.1) in humans and contains 2 unfolded regions and 7 arginine sites, while camel adiponectin has 8 arginine sites. These could be subjected to PAD-mediated deimination and therefore modulate adiponectin folding and function, depending on which arginine is deiminated. Here, deiminated adiponectin was identified in whole llama serum only.",

            "text": "\nXaa-Pro dipeptidase, also known as prolidase, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PEPD gene. Post-translational modifications of prolidase regulate its enzymatic abilities. Deficiency in prolidase leads to a rare, severe autosomal recessive disorder (prolidase deficiency) that causes many chronic, debilitating health conditions in humans (Viglio et al., 2006). These phenotypic symptoms vary and may include skin ulcerations, mental retardation, splenomegaly, recurrent infections, photosensitivity, hyperkeratosis, and unusual facial appearance. Furthermore, prolidase activity was found to be abnormal compared to healthy levels in various medical conditions including: bipolar disorder, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, keloid scar formation, erectile dysfunction, liver disease, lung cancer, hypertension, melanoma, and chronic pancreatitis (Kitchener and Grunden, 2012). In some cancers with increased levels of prolidase activity, such as melanoma, the differential expression of prolidase and its substrate specificity for dipeptides with proline at the carboxyl end suggests the potential of prolidase in becoming a viable, selective endogenous enzyme target for proline prodrugs (Mittal et al., 2005). Serum prolidase enzyme activity is also currently being explored as a biomarker for diseases including chronic hepatitis B and liver fibrosis (Duygu et al., 2013; \u015een et al., 2014; Stanfliet et al., 2015). Phosphorylation of prolidase has been shown to increase its activity while dephosphorylation leads to a decrease in enzyme activity. Post-translational deimination of prolidase has not been described before to our knowledge and may add to understanding of how this enzyme is regulated. Prolidase was here identified as deiminated in both llama serum and EVs.",

DPP4 controls glucose homeostasis and has complex roles in inflammation and homeostasis, including in liver cytokine expression, while its activity in plasma has been shown to correlate with body weight and fat mass (Varin et al., 2019). Interestingly, in camel milk, DDP4 inhibitory peptides have been identified and suggested to play roles in the regulation of glycaemia in humans (Nongonierma et al., 2018). Furthermore, roles for DDP4 in cancer have been found to relate to its post-translational processing of chemokines, thereby limiting lymphocyte migration to sites of inflammation and tumours (Barreira da Silva et al., 2015). As the success of antitumour immune responses depends on the infiltration of solid tumours by effector T cells, a process which is guided by chemokines, DPP4 inhibitors have been suggested as a strategy to enhance tumour immunotherapy (Barreira da Silva et al., 2015). Furthermore, serum DDP4 activity levels in primary HIV infection were found to be significantly decreased and to correlate with inflammation and HIV-induced intestinal damage (Ploquin et al., 2018). Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been found to utilize dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as an entry receptor, via glycosylated sites (Peck et al., 2017). Therefore the identification of DPP4 as a deimination candidate may be of some relevance as such post-translational modification can affect DPP4 structure and function, allowing for moonlighting functions which may vary in pathological compared to pathophysiological milieus.",

It has also been linked to pain (Acher and Goudet, 2015) and psychotic disorders (Matrisciano et al., 2016). The group III mGlu receptors have been described in human stomach and colon, revealing a huge potential for these receptors in the treatment of peripheral disorders, including gastrointestinal dysfunction (Julio-Pieper et al., 2013). As post-translational deimination has not been described before in this receptor, but may well affect is tertiary structure, our current finding may be of some relevance in relation to strategies for developing antagonistic probes (Wenthur et al., 2019). Such pharmacological tools originally designed for mGlu receptors in the CNS may also be directed towards new disease targets in the periphery. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease are potential targets, as irritable bowel diseases can be co-morbid with anxiety and depression (Julio-Pieper et al., 2013).",

In camelids, glutathione peroxidase, which also belongs to the GSH biosynthesis pathway and is a potent anti-oxidant, has been identified as a seminal plasma fertility biomarker (Waheed et al., 2015). Furthermore, camel milk has been shown to boost glutathione and total anti-oxidant capacity in sera and exudates in animal studies (Arab et al., 2017). In a diabetic mouse model, the activities of GSH, alongside glucose insulin and ROS levels, were restored after camel whey protein treatment (Sayed et al., 2017). In humans, GSS deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with varyingly severe clinical manifestations that include metabolic acidosis, hemolytic anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, neurological disorders and sepsis (Guney Varal et al., 2019). Deimination of GSS identified here has not been assessed before and may possibly affect the GSH biosynthesis pathway and such post-translational regulation remains to be further investigated.",

It is a multifaceted protein mainly produced in the liver, where its regulation is influenced by estrogen, glucocorticoids and inflammatory cytokines (Bikle and Schwartz, 2019). It is secreted into the blood circulation and is able to bind the various forms of vitamin D including ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), the 25-hydroxylated forms (calcifediol), and the active hormonal product 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) (Verboven et al., 2002; Norman, 2008). It transports vitamin D metabolites between skin, liver and kidney, and then on to various target tissues (Norman, 2008). VDBP is a macrophage activating factor (MAF) and has been tested as an anti-cancer agent via activation of macrophages against cancer cells (Yamamoto et al., 2008). Some association has also been made between polymorphisms of VDBP and the risk of coronary artery disease (Tarighi et al., 2017). Post-translational modifications (which still remain to be identified) of VDBP have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) (Perga et al., 2015), while protein deimination is well known to be associated with MS (Moscarello et al., 2013). VDBP has previously been identified to be glycosylated (Kilpatrick and Phinney, 2017) but was here identified as a deimination candidate in whole llama serum only. Post-translational deimination may contribute to various functions of VDBP in physiological as well as pathophysiological processes.",

Deletion of the PEAK1 gene in zebrafish, mice and human endothelial cells (ECs) induced severe defects in new blood vessel formation due to deficiencies in EC proliferation, survival and migration. PEAK1 seems therefore to play roles in modulation of cell adhesion and growth factor cues from the extracellular environment necessary for new vessel formation during vertebrate development and cancer (Wang et al., 2018).

Mutations in desmoplakin have been linked to multiple allergies, severe dermatitis and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome (Liang et al., 2019).

Desmosomal proteins have been shown to have both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressive functions, depending of cancer types and can regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and impact treatment sensitivity in different types of cancers (Zhou et al., 2017). As the roles of desmosomal proteins in cancer and metastasis are not fully understood, the identification of deiminated desmoplakin in llama EVs here, and not described before, may be of some interest and add to understanding of diverse functional ability via such post-translational modification.",

Deimination of key immune factors of innate and adaptive immunity and key metabolic proteins is identified here for the first time in a camelid species, highlighting putative protein moonlighting functions via post-translational deimination. It must be noted that in relation to previously observed increases of deiminated proteins with age (Ding et al., 2017), the llama used in this study would be considered relatively old at 21 years of age, as typical llama lifespans are 15\u201325 years, with some individuals surviving 30 years or more.",

Previous studies on the camel urinary proteome revealed enriched proteins from EVs and relevance to stress and immune responses as well as antimicrobial activities (Alhaider et al., 2012). Research on EVs is a relatively new field in comparative immunology and to our knowledge; this is the first description of EVs in serum of a camelid species. Previous studies on EVs in camelids focussed on EVs in camel milk, which were shown to have anti-cancerous properties (Badawy et al., 2018). As PADs have been identified to play major roles in the regulation of EV release (Kholia et al., 2015; Kosgodage et al., 2017 and 2018), including in host-pathogen interactions (Gavinho et al., 2019), such EV-mediated communication may be of great relevance also for addressing diverse zoonotic diseases identified in camels (El-Alfy et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019).",

Our findings will further current understanding of the roles for EVs, PADs and posttranslational deimination throughout phylogeny and in relation to adaption to a range of, including extreme, environments. Furthermore, novel identification of post-translational deimination in key proteins of metabolism and immunity may reveal hitherto unrecognized moonlighting function of these proteins throughout phylogeny, in relation to physiological and pathological processes, as well as being translational to and informing inflammatory and metabolic diseases. PAD-mediated contribution to protein moonlighting and in EV-mediated communication in response to physiological and pathophysiological changes remains therefore a field of further studies.",
