            "text": "Hemagglutinin (HA) is the major constituent of the envelope of influenza virus. The functions, structure and structural changes of this protein have been analysed in great detail. HA initiates infection of the cell by binding to sialic acid containing glycoproteins or glycolipids of host cells and by promoting penetration of the viral genome into the cytoplasm through fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes [26] . Native HA is a \u223c220 kDa trimer of identical subunits, each of which consists of two disulphide-linked glycopeptides, HA1 and HA2. The structure of the soluble ectodomain, obtained by bromelain digestion (BHA), has been determined [27] . HA is built up of two structurally distinct domains, a globular head composed entirely of HA1 and a elongated stem structure consisting of HA2 and part of HA1. The \u2424-structure rich globular domain contains the receptor binding sites. The major component of the stem is a hairpin-like structure consisting of two anti-parallel \u2423-helices of unequal length linked by an extended polypeptide chain, and a membrane proximal, 5-stranded \u2424-sheet. At a lower pH (5.0-5.5) , optimal for membrane fusion, HA undergoes an irreversible conformational change [15, 19] . The distal globular domain loses its trimeric structure and X-ray analysis of TBHA2, a proteolytic fragment of HA in the low pH induced conformation, demonstrates extensive refolding or reorganization, with preservation of the trimeric structure [2, 15] . Based on the irreversibility of this low pH-induced conformational change, increased thermostability of BHA2, and spontaneous folding of a HA2 domain, lacking the membrane spanning domain and fusion peptide, into the low pH-induced conformation in E. coli at neutral pH, it was postulated that the HA1 polypeptide kinetically traps the metastable HA2 fold through extensive contacts with parts of HA2 that must refold to achieve the stable state [2, 3, 16, 19] . Therefore, one might expect that expression of anchor-less HA (HA0s) would result in secretion of trimeric molecules. Indeed, Gething and Sambrook [8] , initially reported expression and efficient secretion of soluble trimeric A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2) HA in CV-1 cells. However, further research demonstrated that A/Japan HA0s was recovered as a mixture of stable trimers, aggregates and monomers, while A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) HA0s was mainly secreted as monomers [18] . Anchor-free H7 HA, when expressed in insect cells or in vertebrate cells remained monomeric and was almost completely retained in the cells, possibly due to a fusion peptide interaction with the membrane [11] . We previously showed that expression of truncated A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) HA in Sf9 cells resulted in the secretion of HA0s molecules with molecular masses ranging from almost 1,500 to 100 kDa [23] . More importantly, we demonstrated that this high M r molecules, called aHA0s, were no longer found in cell supernatant when expression was performed in medium of pH 8.5 instead of pH 6. We now have extended our structural analysis of A/Victoria HA0s present in insect cell supernatant prepared at different extracellular pH-values and investigated the influence of the pH on the folding and oligomerization of anchor-free HA.",

            "text": "Formation of this small secreted trimeric fraction, as well as an aggregated fraction, took place in the medial Golgi or just before arrival at the cell surface and not in ER or the intermediate compartment as is the case for membrane bound HA [6, 11, 18, 20] . The A/Victoria/3/75 H3 hemagglutinin used here resembles the A/Japan/305/57 H2 HA quite well: expression of a truncated form resulted in the secretion of a large amount of aggregated HA0s (aHA0s), a very small amount of most probably trimeric HA0s (HA0s) and again a very large amount of monomeric HA0s (mHA0s). We came to this conclusion based on the results obtained using conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies, cross-linking and trypsin digestion to characterize the HA0s found in Sf9 cell supernatant. The secretion of mHA0s irrespective of the pH, the low extracellular pH-dependent secretion of aHA0s and binding of mAb IIF4 to mHA0s only after low pH incubation, strongly suggest that a low intracellular pH, most probably encountered in trans Golgi, induces a conformational change in part of the mHA0s molecules. Due to an enhanced hydrophobicity, these molecules aggregate to form aHA0s. Viral infections can lead to an additional acidification of the secretion pathway and the cytoplasm, coinciding with the synthesis of virus proteins [4, 5, 13] . This could explain why early during infection hardly any aHA0s was secreted, as a low pH, needed to induce the change, had not yet been established. However, it is also possible that expression levels were simply too low for aggregation to occur.",

            "text": "Based on the binding of IIF4 and LC89 and the high susceptibility to trypsin treatment, we previously reported that aHA0s consisted of aggregated monomeric subunits [23] . But mHA0s was not recognized by mAb IIF4, indicating that the monomeric aHA0s molecules were structurally different from the non-aggregated mHA0s molecules. Binding of IIF4 to mHA0s could be induced by trypsin or low pH treatment, indicating that a conformational change had occurred. It has been suggested that alterations in epitope accessibility are responsible for the increased binding of some HA2-specific mAbs to low pH treated HA [10] . However, binding of IIF4 after trypsin or low pH treatment to mHA0s suggests that the exact conformation of the corresponding epitope would not yet be present in native trimeric HA0 but would be generated by either treatment. Alternatively, the binding of IIF4 after trypsin treatment could be a mHA0s-specific property. Because one face of the long alpha-helix is highly hydrophobic it has been proposed that a single folded subunit would not project from the membrane as an erect spike [27] . Structural studies have shown that some very flexible regions must be present in the stem [2, 25] , allowing the mHA0s molecules to fold into a stable conformation. As a result of this altered conformation the epitope is not present or accessible. This proposed conformation of mHA0s could perhaps also explain the lack of trimerization observed for soluble HA. Helenius and coworkers demonstrated that extensively folded monomeric HA0 molecules are transported from the ER to the intermediate compartiments [20] . During this transport trimerization takes place. Based on the stability of BHA they suggested that the ectodomains alone may contain enough structural information to allow trimerization. They further suggested that the membrane anchor would not be very important in this process but would orient the subunits in the membrane thereby facilitating assembly and contribute to the stability of the final trimeric complex [6, 7] . For anchor-free HA0 they decided that the structural criteria for transport were less stringent; they must fold correctly but do not need to oligomerize [18] . We propose that the quality control in ER and the structural criteria for transport of mHA0s are not less stringent then for membrane bound HA0. We suggest that a mHA0s molecule adopts a structure which is so stable it does not need to oligomerize to be secreted. In the case of monomeric membrane bound HA0 molecules, the membrane anchor prevents folding into such a structure that would no longer need trimerization. This latter process is needed to obtain stable molecules that are allowed to be transported to the Golgi-network. Expression of truncated forms of other viral low-pH fusion dependent membrane proteins also often resulted in secretion of aggregated and monomeric molecules [9, 14] , suggesting a similar structural behaviour of such proteins.",
