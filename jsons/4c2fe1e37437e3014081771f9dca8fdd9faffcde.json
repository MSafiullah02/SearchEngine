From this time a few waves of epidemics caused by different IBV variants spread across the country. In order to gain more insight into the molecular epidemiology of IBV in Poland, in the present study the S1 coding region of 34 IBV isolates and nearly whole genome of 10 strains collected over a period of 38 years was characterized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains belonged to five recently established IBV lineages: GI-1, GI-12, GI-13, GI-19 and GI-23. Additionally, two strains from 1989 and 1997 formed a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree categorized as unique early Polish variants, and one strain was revealed to be the recombinant of these and GI-1 lineage viruses. Irrespective of year of isolation and S1-dependent genotype, the genome sequences of Polish IBV strains showed the presence of six genes and 13 ORFs: 5\u2032UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2032UTR, however their individual genes and putative proteins had different lengths. The phylogenetic analyses performed on the genome of ten Polish IBV strains revealed that they cluster into different groups. The Polish GI-1, GI-19 and GI-23 strains cluster with other similar viruses of these lineages, with the exception of the two strains from 1989 and 1997 which are different. It seems that in Poland in the 1980s and 1990s IBV strains with a unique genome backbone circulated in the field, which were then replaced by other strains belonging to other IBV lineages with a genome backbone specific to these lineages. The recombination analysis showed that some Polish strains resulted from a recombination event involving different IBV lineages, most frequently GI-13 and GI-19.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious disease of chickens known as infectious bronchitis, but the virus can replicate in epithelial cells of different organs, also affecting the urogenital or digestive tracts beside the respiratory tract (Cavanagh, 2005 (Cavanagh, , 2007 . Together with genetically similar viruses isolated from other domesticated Galliformes, IBV belongs to the Igacovirus subgenus within the Gammacoronavirus genus (Nidovirales order, Cornidovirinae suborder, Coronaviridae family, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily). The nonavian SW1 gammacoronavirus isolated from beluga whales was recently assigned to the separate Cegacovirus subgenus (Dong et al., 2007; King et al., 2018) . The virus genome is an approximately 27 kb long single-stranded, positive-sense RNA consisting of several open reading frames (ORFs). Two thirds of the genome in the 5\u2032 end are occupied by two overlapping ORFs encoding viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The 1a and 1b ORFs encode 15 non-structural polypeptides (nsp2-16) which are associated with RNA replication and transcription. In the 3\u2032 end are genes that among other products encode the four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits of about 534 and 627 amino acids during viral maturation. The S2 subunit anchors the spike into the virus membrane whereas S1 forms the extracellular part of the spike and plays a major role in tissue tropism and induction of protective immunity (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 297, "text": "(Cavanagh, 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 298, "end": 315, "text": "(Cavanagh, , 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 698, "end": 717, "text": "(Dong et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 718, "end": 736, "text": "King et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1620, "text": "(Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "IBV undergoes many genetic changes generated both by recombinations and mutations such as substitutions, deletions and insertions, which could lead to the emergence of new variants.

The plot showing the timeline of various IBV lineages's detection and introduction of different vaccines to poultry population in Poland is given in Fig. 4 . The first identified IBV isolates in Europe belonged to the Mass type. In the Netherlands they were diagnosed in the middle of the 1950s and one of them was even attenuated for vaccine development purposes (Bijlenga et al., 2004) . The first IBV material available in our laboratory originates from 1980 and its S1 sequence displayed the features of GI-1 lineage, although no information was provided about the disease symptoms observed in the chicken flock where it was identified. Later on, especially in the middle of the 1980s, numerous cases of a drop in egg production were recorded.

We thoroughly examined four virus strains from that time, 78/1989 78/ , 79/1989 78/ , 80/1989 78/ and 81/1989 78/ . Two of them, strains 78/ 1989 78/ and 79/1989 , have the S1 structure typical of the GI-1 lineage. Similarly, their entire genomes revealed the highest identity to Masslike strains such as H120 or Beaudette. These two viruses came from broiler chickens on farms in the Silesia region separated by only a few kilometers. The two other viruses, 80/1989 and 81/1989, were identified in broilers delivered to the laboratory near the same period (in June 1989) but from farms about 30 km from the previous ones. However, our investigation revealed a distinction between them. Phylogenetic analysis of the full S1 coding region showed that strain 80/ 1989 forms a separate branch on the tree designated as early Polish and was classified as a unique variant of IBV within the GI genotype. Deep analysis of the 81/1989 strain strongly suggests that its S1 coding region was created as the result of a recombination event between the Mass-like strains and the unique early Polish variants circulating in the field at that time. It should be emphasized that the identified recombination breakpoint (651 nt) was in the intermediate region between highly variable regions (HVRs) 1 and 2 and HVR3 previously described as the most frequent locations of variations between IB viruses, and moreover, it exactly matches the breakpoint (550 and 652 nt) of recombinants between viruses of GI-19 and GI-22 lineages (Valastro et al., 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 431, "end": 452, "text": "(de Wit et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 819, "end": 842, "text": "(Bijlenga et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2024, "end": 2044, "text": "(Minta et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2112, "text": "78/1989", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2113, "end": 2126, "text": "78/ , 79/1989", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2127, "end": 2140, "text": "78/ , 80/1989", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2141, "end": 2156, "text": "78/ and 81/1989", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2192, "text": "78/ .
