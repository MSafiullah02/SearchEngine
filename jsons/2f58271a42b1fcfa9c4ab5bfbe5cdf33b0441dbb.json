We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, and 3\u00b70 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0\u00b7001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), and do nothing (80%).

Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions.

Understanding the effect of COVID-19 on mortality during this emergency requires modelling of an infectious disease, as well as wider medical and societal changes. One way of estimating and monitoring excess mortality is to compare observed numbers of deaths with those expected based on the background (pre-COVID-19) mortality risks in the population. 1 One model of the population mortality impact of COVID-19 is based on age-stratified death rates over days in infected patients, but excludes prevalence of underlying conditions, their differing pre-COVID-19 background longterm mortality risks, or the additional risk associated with COVID-19. 2 Few reports of excess deaths beyond specific high-risk populations have been published 3, 4 (most deaths have occurred in people with underlying health conditions or those of older ages [5] [6] [7] ). This situation is changing, with severe infections being treated in younger patients with COVID-19 who do not have underlying conditions. 8 Case fatality rates for COVID-19 vary from 0\u00b727% to 10%, 9 possibly explained by differing demography, testing strategies, and prev alence of under lying conditions. The UK has relatively high case fatality rates (8\u00b72%), but mortality rates are unknown at this stage of the pandemic because testing is more common among sicker patients who are admitted to hospital (the context where most testing has been done) rather than milder cases. On April 14, the Office for National Statistics reported 6000 excess deaths registered in the week March 28 to April 3, 2020, of which about 2500 deaths did not have COVID-19 recorded on the death certificates, providing the first indication of indirect effects of the pandemic on mortality. 10 Physical distancing and other strategies focus on highrisk groups, with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifying \"older adults, and people who have serious chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and lung disease\". 11 On March 16, 2020, the UK Government announced that particular subgroups are at high risk from COVID-19, 12 and recommended stringent distancing measures, telling people how to stay away from others. On March 22, 2020 , the Government announced that 1\u00b75 million \"extremely vulnerable\" people in England with underlying conditions (including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) should \"shield\" for 12 weeks, but did not explain how these conditions were selected. 13 The UK Government did not implement full suppression (during which only key workers are likely to be exposed) until March 23, 2020 . Up to that date, people were still in close proximity in work and public places.",

Conversely, with mitigation (ie, less rigorous and voluntary measures), we predict between 18 000 and 37 000 deaths. We have provided a prototype risk calculator for the researchers and policy makers to make estimates and change the assumptions in the model.

Follow-up ceased at the date of death or on Jan 1, 2017. We estimated prevalence of each underlying condition and used Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1-year all-cause mortality at each age group cell to estimate the number of excess deaths by age bands and at each number of conditions cell to estimate by number of underlying conditions. We then modelled the excess COVID-19-associated mortality for relative impact of mortality associated with COVID-19 (relative risk [RR] compared with background mortality) of 1\u00b75, 2\u00b70, and 3\u00b70 21 at the infection rate consequences of different strategies: full suppression (0\u00b7001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), or do nothing (80%). 22 Relative risk is a comparison of risks or probabilities. For example, an RR of 2\u00b70 for COVID-19 describes a doubling of the risk of mortality in individuals infected with or affected by COVID-19 versus their background risk of death. A definition of COVID-19-related mortality relevant to the emergency includes both deaths among those infected (direct), and deaths among those affected by health service, societal, and economic changes (indirect). Considering excess deaths in this way, it is reasonable to consider that a high proportion (eg, 80% of the population) might be affected by the COVID-19 emergency. To extrapolate our estimates of excess deaths to the whole population of England older than 30 years, we used 2018 estimates of overall population size and mortality. 23 For illustration, we applied our study estimates to UN Population Fund 24 estimates of population size in other countries. All analyses were done using R, version 3.4.3. Data were analysed in the University College London ISO27001 safe haven.",

These are major parameters in understanding the emergency, and the best source of estimates comes from electronic records, with implications for policy makers, clinicians, and the public. Our results support rigorous, sustained implementation of suppression measures. 25 With our definition of overall excess deaths, combining direct and indirect effects among those with and without infection, it is reasonable to consider that a high (eg, 80%) proportion of the population might be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not know what the relative impact of excess deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic will be over a 1-year period in any country. However, clinical and societal concern internationally is that it is not a regular seasonal flu. We show that if the pandemic is associated with an RR of 1\u00b75, then there will be 18 374 excess deaths in a mitigation scenario and 146 996 excess deaths in a do nothing scenario; compared with two deaths under a full suppression scenario. A doubling of the risk is worth considering because of uncertainty regarding the actual risk associated with COVID-19 and mounting health-care burden around the world.

Such policies, which require actionable knowledge across multiple diseases have few, if any, historical precedents; only countries with nationwide health-system data can implement such policies. The list was probably designed to identify patients who are most susceptible to infection or have a degree of immunosuppression, which cannot be quantified in a standardised way. The prognosis research strategy initiative has previously made recommendations for consistent approaches to understanding prognosis across multiple diseases and clinical specialties, the importance of which is highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 27 We found that patients with conditions not on the vulnerable patient list may be at as high or greater mortality than those who are. For example, cardiovascular disease is not on the vulnerable patient list and has a 1-year mortality of 6%; we found that the 1-year mortality risk of people with two or more conditions was 11%but multiple morbidities co-occurring in the same individual do not yet qualify as extremely vulnerable. A more systematic, transparent understanding is needed of which underlying conditions are important for policy and patients. Further research is required to identify the extent to which patients with other physical conditions, frailty, and mental health conditions as well as those experiencing social exclusion (eg, homeless people and intravenous drug users) might benefit from targeted interventions.",

Specifically, it is important to study a wider range of underlying conditions, a wider range of hospital and critical care admissions, linkage of primary care data to nationally available information on COVID-19 testing, linkage to richer, real-time hospital data, and use of nationwide NHS data. Second, we believe it is both a limitation and a strength that our model is simple and supports public understanding.
