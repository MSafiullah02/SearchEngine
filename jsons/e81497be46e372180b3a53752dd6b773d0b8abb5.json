Methods This study was a retrospective observational study conducted in the 16-bedded PICU of a tertiary referral center. Two years (2013)(2014)(2015) period of the PICU without an intensivist and the following two years (2015-2017) when it was attended by an intensivist who was also the first ever graduate of the fellowship program in Turkey were compared. Results Number of patients followed in PICU increased more than 2-fold. Number of mechanically ventilated patients increased more than 2-folds and presence of intensivist reduced the mechanical ventilation duration by 59%. Presence of intensivist reduced the mortality rates by 2.18 times. It was shown that management of PICU beds by an intensivist resulted in increased number of patients per year per PICU bed, increased care of true critical care patients who are in need of more intensive therapies and invasive procedures including extracorporeal treatment options, decreased length of stay, decreased number and rate of nosocomial infections, and decreased mortality rate.",

In high-income countries, PICU being attended by a pediatric intensivist is not a matter of debate. In those countries, favorable impact of 24 h inhospital presence of a PICU attending physician had been demonstrated [3, 4] . In Turkey, before the graduation of pioneer PICU fellows, only 30% of the PICUs were attended by pediatric intensivists [5] . In high-income countries, organization of PICUs were completed 30 y ago and many studies about the quality of care were conducted since then. In Turkey, PICU fellowship program was initiated at 2011. First fellows graduated at the end of 2014. In Turkey, doctors in every specialty are obliged to serve in state hospitals for a predefined time period. For this reason the first graduate of the PICU fellowship program was appointed to a hospital of Ministry of Health. There had been no PICU specialists in that hospital previously and this situation allowed authors to measure how the presence of an intensivist affected the quality of care in a PICU.",

In the pre-pediatric intensivist period, CVVHDF and TPE applications could only be performed with support of the technical staff of the supplier company. With the arrival of the pediatric intensivist, the nurse team was trained for the procedures of CVVHDF and TPE. Two senior nurses were appointed to be responsible for the CVHDF and TPE program.",

SMR reduction in the post-pediatric intensivist period confirms that the presence of an intensivist improves outcome (Table 1) . This well-known fact is confirmed by the current study conducted in a middleincome country. It is important to emphasize that personnel staffing, structure and technological infrastructure of PICU were same over the course of the study. The only variable that changed in the intensive care unit was the management of the team by the pediatric intensivist. When the pediatric intensivist attended the PICU, the mortality rate decreased to 7%, which is an acceptable mortality rate for a middle-income country. PICU mortality rate has been reported as 2.9% and 5.6% in United States and Europe respectively [15, 16] .",

All the patients who were not at terminal stage and have deteriorated in other departments were transferred to PICU and treated at PICU under the responsibility of the pediatric intensivist.

It is not possible to provide 100% coverage of PICU beds by intensivists in our country today due to the lack of educated pediatric intensivists. It has been previously reported that the ratio of the number of pediatric intensivists to PICU beds is 1:31.7 in Turkey [5] while this ratio is 1:2-1:4.5 in United States, 1:3-1:5 in Australia, and 1:1.2-1:1.6 in Europe [17] .

Although it is not one of the targets of this study, it is obvious that all these mentioned aspects above also influence the high costs of the intensive care.",
