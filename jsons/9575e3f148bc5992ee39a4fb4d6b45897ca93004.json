            "text": "PCR methodologies have become firmly entrenched in many clinical laboratories for the detection of a wide range of organisms, because they offer major advantages of improved sensitivity and rapidity over traditional diagnostic methods. However, many variables need to be considered in performing a reliable PCR assay, ranging from nucleic acid extraction, storage, composition of the PCR reaction mix used, to the dynamics of the amplification reaction. To control for these variables, there is an obvious need for standardised reagents and quality assurance programmes to obtain reproducible and clinically significant results. The diagnostic potential of the PCR technology has been greatly enhanced with the development of multiplex, real-time, and quantitative PCR methods, and these are now routinely performed in many diagnostic laboratories. More recently, PCR has been applied to bacterial typing, and a reasonable prediction is that in the near future, bacterial typing will be performed by either some variant of next-generation sequencing, or by HRM analysis of selected markers, depending on the amount of information required.",

Proteins and restriction enzymes are removed by phenol and chloroform in disrupting protein secondary structure causing proteins to denature and precipitate from solution. Although each of these solvents is capable of performing this function alone, the two materials together remove proteins from solution much more effectively. Nucleic acids are recovered in the liquid phase. \u2022 Nucleic acids are released by means of strongly denaturing and reducing agents, including hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. protease, lysozyme, lyticase), from cells and tissues and subsequently extracted and purified with a mixture of chloroform and phenol. The nucleic acids are finally obtained from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation or narrowing down by means of dialysis [63] or capturing via silicon resins or magnetic particles. \u2022 Proteinase K 1 /phenol method, in which a proteolytic enzyme such as proteinase K or a surfactant is added to disrupt the cell membrane or wall and the protein of 1 Proteinase K is a commonly used protease which is commercially available as a lyophilized powder or in aqueous solutions or suspension (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The typical activity of proteinase K preparations is about 30 Units/mg. The concentrations of proteinase K in the extraction composition is preferably at least about 25 units/ml or greater, at least about 50 units/ml or greater or at least about 100 units/ml or greater. Maximal concentrations are effected by solubility of the enzyme as well as the ability to sufficiently denature the enzyme at the end of extraction so 13 a complex of interest is degraded to free nucleic acids; then phenol/chloroform are added and the mixture is centrifuged to have the nucleic acids transferred into the aqueous phase; the aqueous phase is recovered by separation and ethanol, isopropanol or the like is added to the recovered aqueous phase, thereby rendering the nucleic acids insoluble [63] . \u2022 The AGPC method, in which a liquid mixture of guanidinium isothiocyanate and phenol is added to a sample of interest to disrupt the cell membrane and wall, so that the protein of the complex is denatured to become soluble; nucleic acids are then freed and chloroform is added to transfer the nucleic acids to the aqueous phase; the aqueous phase is recovered by separation and thereafter, ethanol, isopropanol or the like is added to the recovered aqueous phase, thereby rendering the nucleic acids insoluble [15] . This method often uses a proprietary formulation of this reagent called Trizol (TRIzol is a chemical solution used in RNA/DNA/protein extraction and is the brand name of the product from Invitrogen). \u2022 The guanidinium method, in which guanidinium hydrochloride or guanidinium thiocyanate is added to a sample of interest to disrupt the cell membrane and wall, so that the protein of the complex is denatured to become soluble and to remove dissolved impurities; nucleic acids are then freed and ethanol or isopropanol is added to render the free nucleic acids insoluble. Elution of any bound nucleic acids from the supporting material is with water or low-salt buffers such as 10 mmol/l Tris or TE (10 mmol/l Tris, 1 mmol/l EDTA). An advantage of this method is that chaotropic salts ensure the irreversible denaturing and thus inactivation of nucleases. Essential disadvantages of the method are that the concentration of the chaotropic salts to some extent have to be strongly adjusted to the material used, and also the lysis of biological material, such as fungal or plant tissue, is sometimes only very inefficient (these may require initial protease inclusion to dissolve these thicker cell walls). If enzymes (proteinase, RNase) are used in the purification methods, the concentration of chaotropic agents must be reduced below values which otherwise bring about inactivation of nucleases [15, 63] . \u2022 The sodium iodide method, in which sodium iodide containing glycogen which has affinity for the nucleic acid to be extracted is added to a sample of interest, whereby the cell membrane and wall are disrupted and the protein of the complex is denatured, so that it becomes soluble; nucleic acids are then freed and isopropanol is added to render the free nucleic acids and glycogen insoluble [32] .",

An advantage of such a commercially available method is that nucleic acids can be extracted even from materials with very small nucleic acid content with a universal protocol. A disadvantage is that the nucleic acid preparations may not meet high quality standards (including photometric measurement-absorption ratios of less than 1.70 at 260 nm to 280 nm) and this may increase the potential of inhibition within the PCR reaction. It is possible that PCR inhibitors (heme protein, anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants and zwitterionic surfactants) can sometimes interfere with subsequent PCR amplification. These inhibitors may therefore be present in the extraction solution or obtained as part of the extraction process from the biological sample or from some other source. The presence of PCR inhibitors in the extraction solution would result in little or no amplification of nucleic acids and this would be deemed to constitute absence of effective extraction from the sample. That is where the inclusion in the PCR of some form of internal control is of importance and why standards push for their inclusion. Therefore the chosen method by which high-purity total DNA and total RNA (including tRNA, mRNA, rRNA, mitochondrial RNA and hnRNA [Heterogeneous nuclear RNA -a variety of RNAs found in the nucleus, including primary transcripts]) can be prepared, which is universally applicable with regard to the nucleic-acid-containing source material and is quick and simple to handle, will require evaluation to optimise methods for each application of extraction and PCR combination for the specific specimen type and method chosen.",

Ideally the process used should be quick, simple, reproducible and this has been improved with the many different commercial methods available. Put simplynucleic acids must be extracted in such a manner that they can be subsequently amplified by PCR. Coupled to these advances are the increasingly available commercial robotic extraction systems which increase the throughput and lessen the boredom of multiple smaller scale extractions. These systems may use magnetic particle-based extraction (the majority of high through-put systems) or silica resin based extraction systems.

DNA in the supernatant is ready for PCR. InstaGene R matrix is made with a specially formulated 6% w/v Chelex resin and it makes DNA sample preparation fast, easy, and costeffective. The Chelex matrix binds to PCR inhibitors and adsorbs cell lysis products rather than DNA, preventing DNA loss due to irreversible DNA binding and produces an improved substrate for PCR amplification. http://www.bio-rad.com/prd/en/US/adirect/biorad?cmd=BRCatgProductDetail& productID=111001 2. Applied Biosystems has a 20 ml PrepMan R Ultra Preparation reagent and is applicable for a variety of different sample preparation applications. It has been used successfully to prepare DNA template from bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, both from a plate or from tissue smears, human cells (buccal swab), mammalian whole blood and from Gram-negative food-borne pathogens for use in PCR amplification reactions. Using a simple boil and spin protocol, PrepMan R Ultra Reagent efficiently inactivates PCR inhibitors and significantly reduces the need to repeat the template preparation step. PrepMan R Ultra Reagent is a novel formulation, developed entirely at Applied Biosystems, and is a homogeneous solution that does not contain Chelex or any other type of resin or matrix. It is based on ethyl glycol monobutyl ether with hydroxylated organoamine.

This must be monitored by the inclusion of non-template or water controls in every PCR. The development of closed-tube, real-time PCR technologies and melting curve analysis has greatly reduced the risk of contamination and false positive results. DNA degradation or PCR inhibitors in clinical specimens can lead to false negative results and this must be monitored by the inclusion of internal positive controls.",

Also, real-time PCR instruments cycle the temperatures more rapidly than conventional thermocyclers, and, because of the increased sensitivity of the fluorescent detection system, offer a much broader dynamic range compared to conventional PCR. The inbuilt detection system offers product confirmation and quantification, with an electronic result output which lends itself to high through-put electronic reporting.",

The disadvantage is that it will bind to any double-stranded DNA in the reaction, including non-specific reaction products such as primer-dimer, which may give false-positive results or an overestimation of the target concentration. To help assess specificity, the dissociation curve of the amplified product can be analysed to determine the melting point. If two or more melting peaks are evident, it suggests that more than one amplified sequence was obtained, and the amplification was not specific for a single DNA target.

Each of these has the capacity to use multiple reporter dyes with multiple quenchers for efficient FRET pairs. Hydrolysis or TaqMan R probes (also called 5 -nuclease probes because the 5 -exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase cleaves the probe) were among the first to be used in real-time PCR and are arguably the most widely used fluorescent probe format. They are sequence-specific oligonucleotides that carry a fluorescent dye at the 5 base, and a quenching dye on the 3 base, and are designed to anneal to a complementary sequence on the amplification product. Whilst the probe is intact, the quencher and reporter are in close proximity, and the quencher absorbs the signal from the reporter through FRET. During amplification the 5 -nuclease activity of the DNA polymerase hydrolyses the probe [27] , separating the fluorescent reporter dye and the quencher, allowing the reporter's energy to be released as a fluorescent signal. The level of fluorescence increases in each cycle proportional to the rate of probe cleavage, and is indicative of a positive reaction. Examples of common quencher fluorophores include TAMRA, DABCYL, and BHQ, whereas many reporter dyes are available (e.g., FAM, VIC, NED, etc.). Hydrolysis probes have greater specificity because only sequence-specific amplification is measured.",

External standards are usually 10-fold serial dilutions of the target. The standards are usually plasmids but can be whole organisms or nucleic acid. These standards are amplified and detected using the same assay conditions as for samples. The PCR cycle at which product fluorescence intensity rises or is higher than the background is called the crossing point (Cp). At this point the exponential PCR phase begins. Theoretically, the rate of amplification is maximal with PCR products doubling every cycle; hence quantification is performed at this stage. Following completion of the assay the Cp for each standard is determined and standard curve is prepared using instrument software. A typical standard curve is a plot of the cycle number Cp at the (Y-axis) versus the log of initial template amount (X-axis), derived from an assay based on serial dilutions. The standard curve is a least square fit line drawn through all dilutions (Fig. 2.1; bottom) . Using several standards which cover the expected clinical range a line of best fit can be determined using the Cp values. It is then a case of determining the unknown samples Cp and reading the resulting concentration. Absolute quantification with external standards are useful but they do not control for changes in amplification efficiencies which may occur and vary from sample to sample. Hence, if PCR inhibition occurs due to inhibitors in the patient sample, this degree of inhibition will not be represented in the standard curve, therefore a lower quantitative value may be produced.

This DNA fragment can be added to an individual sample prior to nucleic acid extraction and PCR. The fragment is then co-extracted and amplified along with the target. Two probes with different fluorescent labels are used; one to detect the target and the other to detect the internal control. The advantage of this system is the amplification efficiency of the reaction will be the same for the target as well as the control.

For example, a target rich in G/C bases will have a higher Tm than a target with high A/T content. This is due to the stronger hydrogen bonds that join C and G residues. This makes FRET probes particularly useful for rapid genotyping. Using Tm, the degree of specificity can measured and a specific target can be confirmed.

The use of multiplex assays in diagnostic microbiology has many obvious attractions. In theory, the multiplexing of assays should enable many infectious agent targets to be detected with economies in labour, consumables and with the requirement for only a small volume of sample. In fact, since the sample extraction is usually the most expensive component of a PCR assay, the reduction in the sample extract volume required to test for multiple targets probably provides the most attractive feature of multiplex assays. Once a PCR is at peak efficiency the only conceivable method to increase its sensitivity is to increase the effective amount of sample introduced into the assay.

The oldest of these uses primers for different targets which produce amplicons of different sizes distinguishable by gel-electrophoresis [61] . This method can be used as a single PCR or nested for extra sensitivity. It has the advantage that it is less susceptible to sequence variation than real-time methods but is more labour intensive and relies on subjective interpretation of gel electrophoresis results. A recent development is the use of capillary electrophoresis for this purpose and there are several commercial alternative equipment options available which afford very accurate measurement of amplicon size. Real-time technologies are now in general use and can be multiplexed using fluorphore-labelled probes which are detected at different wavelengths. However, in spite of real-time thermocyclers having up to six wavelength options most workers find that it is difficult to devise multiplexes which perform satisfactorily with more than three different probe labels in an assay. It is of course possible to perform a multiplex assay with large numbers of primer sets and to then pass the product to real-time triplex assays. This introduces risk of laboratory cross-contamination, a known hazard of nested PCRs, but this can be reduced by limiting the initial multiplex PCR to 10-20 cycles, a principle used by Stanley and Szewezuk in their Tandem assays [69] . Luminex bead technology has the potential to detect up to 100 targets in an assay but practical considerations probably limit this to about 30. This method consists of performing a generic PCR or one with multiple primer sets in which the primers carry a biotin label. Products from the multiplex are hybridised with Luminex beads carrying probes specific for the multiple targets. The beads can be uniquely identified as the 100 bead types available each contain different proportions of fluorescent material and each probe is thus identified [64] . A fluorescent-labelled avidin is applied and washing steps remove background fluorescent material before the beads are processed in a flow-cytometer. A novel multiplex approach has been suggested recently which involves the use of Mass Tag PCR [19] . Numerous targets can be detected with DNA microarray technologies but the sensitivity of these is limited by the amount of target material available unless generic amplification is first performed [4] . Array technology is also expensive but will become useful for the detection of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial cultures where target quantity is unlimited and when these genes sequences have been more fully identified.",

In the latter case, the question of competition for reagents within the PCR, between the multiple agents becomes an issue. In general, reagent concentration needs to be increased in multiplex assays to allow for full efficiency. It is important to determine whether a large copy number of one agent will inhibit the reactivity of a small copy number of another [81] . For example in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample one would only expect infection with one flavivirus causing encephalitis but in genital samples multiple HPV virus infections are commonplace and may be mixtures of high and low risk types for the causation of cervical carcinoma in widely varying copy numbers. In our laboratory we are endeavouring to put in place some of the principles described in this article in the in-house PCR assays that we use. Our initial simple use of multiplexing is in providing an inbuilt control of sample extraction efficiency and removal of RT and/or PCR inhibitors, in a semi-quantitative fashion. Standardized amounts of equine herpesvirus (EHV) and/or MS-2 RNA coliphage are incorporated in extraction lysis buffers and assays for these agents are carried out as multiplexed systems with different probe labels than for target agents. This ensures that unsatisfactory extraction or incomplete removal of inhibitors is detected and also checks that thermocycling has been performed properly. We have designed an assay with three probe labels for HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella virus which has three probe label types and allows for duplicate tests for the viruses and incudes an EHV control. Another assay modifies the principle of tandem PCR suggested by Stanley and Szewezuk [69] . In this assay for Chamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, an initial PCR multiplex containing six primer sets is cycled for 20 cycles only in a conventional thermocycler. Diluted products are then transferred to real-time triplex assays for processing in a real-time thermocycler. This multiplex reduces competition for reagents if multiple infection is present and includes three targets for C. trachomatis, two for N. gonorrhoeae and an EHV control. Although in their early stages we have a number of other multiplex assays in development and are confident that this approach, using whichever multiplex technology becomes dominant, will provide the only realistic approach to give wide coverage of infectious agents.",

Therefore, bacterial species are currently defined using a pragmatic mix of phylogenetic, gene flow and phenotypic data, with the weights given to these criteria, and the level of diversity within a species varying from case to case. It is however universal that a bacterial species is not composed of a single clone. In other words, bacterial species contain diversity and can be divided into finer taxonomic units. These are generally named and recognised using less formal conventions than are used for the standard Latin scientific nomenclature. An exception to this is the category of subspecies, which is used in conventional formal taxonomy. However, in the great majority of cases, a taxonomic unit that is a subset of a species is known simply as a \"type\", or a derivative of this word such as \"serotype\", genotype or \"subtype\". In the last 30 years, a plethora of bacterial typing technologies and methods have emerged, and bacterial typing has become commonplace in many laboratories.",

This question is not meaningful, in part because there is no accepted definition of the term \"strain\". Greater than 0.1% of bacterial cell divisions yield a point mutation somewhere in the genome, and other classes of genetic change occur at a much higher frequency than this. Accordingly, there is no such thing as a bacterial population of any significant size in which all the cells are genetically identical, and \"clones\" or lineages cannot be regarded as immutable entities. In essence, what typing methods do is indicate whether or not the most recent common ancestor of two or more isolates post-dates a particular time in the past.

While such typing methods often do not directly indicate clinical properties, the association between types and such properties may have been previously determined. Therefore, the clinically relevant properties of an isolate such as the resistance and virulence phenotype can sometimes be inferred from the type by inductive reasoning. Typing methods that provide results that indicate the evolutionary history of the isolate can be used to determine and monitor the diversities and population structures of bacterial species. This is frequently performed as a largely academic exercise. However, the implications can be far from trivial. Mapping the patterns of dissemination onto phylogeny can provide profound insight into the history of a bacterial species.

            "text": "Numerous nucleic acid-based bacterial typing methods have been developed in the last two decades. Many of these are based on the conversion of the genome into a series of DNA fragments of varying size that can be resolved by electrophoresis so as to generate a genetic fingerprint. A distinctive feature of this family of methods is that there is nothing inherent in the techniques that allows inference as to just what genetic change causes a change in the fingerprint. In other words, the fragments in the gel are anonymous, although they can usually be identified if the complete genome sequence is known. A genome can be converted into fragments by either cleavage or synthesis. Probably the most conceptually straightforward method is cleavage of the genome with a very infrequently cutting restriction enzyme, followed by resolution of the resulting very large fragments by variable field agarose electrophoresis. This technique makes use of a hexagonal electrode that allows rapid alteration of the angle of the voltage gradient. For reasons that are not fully understood, this results in the resolution of DNA fragments much larger than can be resolved by conventional agarose electrophoresis. The early versions of this method made use of a field that periodically reversed its direction. This was termed pulsed-field electrophoresis (PFGE). A variant of this approach that makes use of a hexagonal electrode and consequent multiple directions for the electric field has become commonplace. This is correctly known as \"(contour) clamped homogenous electric fields\" (CHEF) gel electrophoresis, although the PFGE abbreviation remains ubiquitous [57] . Variation in PFGE fingerprints likely arise from large genome rearrangements, and gene gain or loss events that change the size of restriction fragments. Point mutations that create or destroy restriction sites may also occur, but these are likely to be very rare given the very small percentage of the genome that the restriction sites comprise. PFGE provides very high resolving power, and there is a convention that even if there is up to three band differences between the fingerprints of different isolates, very recent epidemiological linkage between these isolates cannot be ruled out [76] . It should be noted that this convention is not fully accepted, and numerous variants have been proposed. There is sufficient detail in the data that relative evolutionary distances can be estimated and phylogenetic trees constructed [92] . PFGE remains an extensively used method. For instance, it is arguably the gold standard for monitoring Staphylococcus aureus dissemination in Australia [55] .",

The simplest approach is termed random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis [58] . This makes use of one or two (generally one) 10mer PCR primers of random sequence. PCR products will form whenever by chance two primers molecules anneal to the template in opposite orientations with their 3 ends facing towards each other, and at a distance that is not too large for PCR product synthesis. The resulting fragments are quite small and can easily be resolved by conventional agarose electrophoresis. A persistent problem with RAPD analysis is poor reproducibility, particularly between laboratories. This is probably due to the weak annealing between the very short 10mer primers and their targets which may not even be 100% complementary with the primer, and consequent extreme sensitivity to reaction conditions. A variation of the RAPD approach that is designed to have better reproducibility is based upon sequences that are repeated throughout bacterial genomes. These are known variously as \"REP\", \"ERIC\", and \"BOX\" sequences [5, 12, 74, 89] , depending upon the sequence and the bacterial species, and there is considerable strain to strain variation regarding just where these repeats are. PCR-based typing methods have been developed that are very similar to RAPD methods, but make use of primers that target these repeat sequences. These methods are less prone to reproducibility problems, probably because of stronger annealing between the primers and their genuine targets.",

The principal behind this method is the cleavage of the genome with two restriction enzymes so as to generate a large number of fragments, and then the amplification by PCR of a subset of these fragments. The number of fragments in the subset is optimised so as to provide a good compromise being large enough to provide high discriminatory power and small enough to for clear band separation. The fragments are amplified by first ligating adaptors to the sticky ends, and then performing PCR using primers that target the adaptor sequences. The selectivity of the amplification is obtained by using primers with 3 extensions that will therefore only anneal to adaptors that by chance are adjacent to a particular base(s) in the amplified fragments, and also by labelling only one primer, so that fragments derived purely from the other primer are not visualised. In general, denaturing thin polyacrylamide slab gels (i.e. DNA sequencing gels) or capillary electrophoresis are used to separate the amplified fragments. AFLP analysis is highly reproducible and discriminatory. Like PFGE, there is sufficient detail in the fingerprints to allow estimation of relative evolutionary distances [46] .",

In general, with these methods it is possible to directly infer the genetic changes that give rise to different types, although there is some variation from method to method with the precision that this can be achieved. The earliest described examples involve restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of highly variable loci. This can be done either by cleaving the entire genome with a restriction enzyme and then visualising the fragments of interest by Southern hybridisation, or by amplifying the locus of interest by PCR, and then carrying out the restriction digestion after that. Most methods involve analysis of only one locus. Ribotyping is an automatable Southern hybridization-based method that targets the genes that encode ribosomal RNA, as well as spacer regions [9, 13] . A well known example of a PCR-based method is flaA RFLP analysis in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli [53] . In recent years RFLP-based methods have largely been superseded. This is because they are inherently multistep to perform, and not all sequence changes will change the location of the restriction sites, thus limiting resolving power. In addition, with these methods, direct inference of the precise genetic changes that lead to changes in banding patterns is not possible.",

There are several examples of single locus-based sequence typing methods [6, 20, 25, 45, 47] . Many of these target genes that are hypervariable, often because of immune selection directed against the surface-located gene product. These methods are often very informative and efficient. However, they are limited in that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can mean that a single gene is an inadequate marker for the evolutionary position of an entire genome. Therefore, single locus sequence typing can be very effective for testing hypotheses of epidemiological linkage but less effective for studies of population structure. The response to this was the development just over a decade ago of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) [44] . This involves sequencing of standardized fragments of approximately 450 bp from multiple (almost always seven) housekeeping genes. Housekeeping genes encode cytoplasmic enzymes involved in core metabolism or other fundamental cellular processes. They therefore do not evolve by positive selection, so sequence differences accumulate in a clock-like fashion and do not reflect differing selective pressures in different strains or lineages. A very important aspect of MLST is on-line databases of variants at the loci (alleles), and the alleles that are found together in isolates (sequence types). These web sites also contain information regarding the isolates, and a variety of analytical tools. They are a really powerful resource for studying bacterial population structures. There are now MLST schemes for essentially all the major bacterial pathogens, and the associated web sites can be reached via http://www.mlst.net/ and http://pubmlst.org/. MLST is still primarily a research tool, as carrying out seven sequence determinations remains a time and cost challenge for routine high throughput applications.

The descriptor of resolution can be the power to identify particular sequence types (STs) or groups of STs, or alternatively the power to discriminate all STs from all STs. In the latter case, this is assessed by calculating the Simpsons Index of Diversity which in this context is the probability that any two STs selected at random will be discriminated if the SNPs are interrogated. Published SNP-based bacterial typing methods in general make use of allele specific PCR, or competitive hybridization of Taqman probes, in real-time PCR devices [8, 60] .

            "text": "The housekeeping genes used in MLST evolve slowly, and this limits MLST resolution. A direct approach to circumventing this is to use loci that evolve more rapidly. Microsatellite loci in multicellular organisms are composed of, or contain, sequence repeats. The repeating units are very short; 1-\u223c6 nucleotides. They evolve rapidly due to slipped strand mis-pairing during DNA replication. It is now known that repeat-containing loci are not hard to find in bacteria, and, as expected, they also evolve rapidly and so have high informative power for typing. In bacteria, they are known as variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci. There have been many recent publications concerning VNTR-based bacterial typing methods, and this is a small sample [30, 46, 56, 62, 68, 79, 82] . The repeating units in bacterial VNTR loci are more variable in length than microsatellites in higher organisms, but they appear to be usefully polymorphic whatever the repeat length. Variation in loci with long repeat lengths is probably due to homologous recombination rather than slipped strand mis-pairing. VNTR based tying methods can be single locus or multi-locus. Recent trends are towards multilocus methods, and these are known generically as \"multilocus VNTR analysis\" (MLVA). VNTR loci can be interrogated by DNA sequencing, or, as is commonly done with microsatellite analysis, by length determination. Length-based MLVA methods are inherently efficient because the loci can be amplified in a multiplex PCR reaction using primers labelled with different fluorophores, and the products then resolved by capillary electrophoresis. However, with complex repeat loci, in which not all the repeating units are identical, sequence differences can be missed when only the length is determined.",

Thus the same allelic states can result from different evolutionary histories i.e. homoplasy can occur. This can on occasion confound MLVA analysis. A strategy to circumvent this is to use a combination of markers that include both VNTRs and more slowly evolving markers that are less prone to homoplasy, such as SNPs that define phylogentic lineages. This strategy has been termed phylogenetic hierarchical analyses using nucleic acids (PHRANA) [33, 34] . The rationale is that the slowly evolving markers divide the species into lineages in which the average evolutionary distance between strains is sufficiently low that the probability of homoplasy in the VNTR markers is greatly reduced. In reality, there are innumerable possible combinations of rapidly and slowly evolving markers, and they will all provide a particular compromise between resolving power, lack of homoplasy, and ease and cost of execution. One emerging example is the use of sequences of multiple rapidly evolving surface antigen encoding genes to type Neisseria gonhorrhoeae [85] .",

One of the major unexpected findings to emerge from the explosion of bacterial genome sequencing in the last decade has been the extent of variation in gene content between different isolates in the same species. The term \"pan-genome\" has been coined to describe the gene content of a species [77] , and a pan-genome can contain many more genes than any cell. It therefore follows that typing on the basis of gene presence or absence can have considerable resolving power. This approach is sometimes termed binary typing, because the informative genes exhibit binary variation i.e. they exist in two states: present or not present. The fact that many determinants of virulence and resistance to antimicrobials are carried on mobile elements that are inherently likely to exhibit binary variation increases the potential informative power of this approach. Micro-array technology has been used to study genome-wide binary variation. Comparative genome hybridization (CGH) arrays are used for this task [75, 93] . They are generally equipped with probes deduced from all the open reading frames in multiple genome sequences within a species. Analysis by CGH array is too laborious to be regarded as a bacterial typing method, although smaller arrays with probes for e.g. putative virulence factors are increasingly being applied to the analysis of large numbers of isolates [50] .",

The attraction of HRM is that the amplification plus the HRM analysis constitutes a homogeneous, single step and closed tube procedure. Its potential for miniaturization is excellent because of a lack of requirement for moving parts and/or microfluidics. HRM analysis can be added to pre-existing PCR-based primary diagnosis or binary typing methods so as to provide additional information at essentially no cost. The consumables costs of stand-alone HRM analyse are typically less than $1.00, because the requirements are only unlabelled primers and a generic PCR master mix. HRM analysis has been shown to be able to discriminate multiple sequence variants [14, 24, 37, 48, 73] , and to yield data that can be compared between laboratories [78] , which raises the possibility of on-line comparison of HRM curves, in a manner analogous to sequence comparison using Genbank or MLST sites.",

Analysis of mixed/clinical samples will become commonplace, and typing will be combined with diagnosis. Typing data will be interpreted with reference to massive amounts of comparative genomic data, and this will greatly facilitate the monitoring of dissemination at all scales of time and space, and the inference of clinically relevant properties.",
