For example, individuals in whom all class II HLA alleles are heterozygous are more likely to clear hepatitis B infection,9 and those with heterozygous class I alleles progress from HIV to an AIDS-defining illness more slowly and have lower mortality.10 The converse scenario, increased HLA homozygosity, may contribute to the increased susceptibility to infection in genetically isolated populations.11\n",

In general, many genetic loci make modest contributions to human disease susceptibility (ie, they are genetically complex), and most of the focus in the field has been on identifying these loci and their effects in infection and in other conditions. However, there are many single-gene (Mendelian) disorders affecting immune function, with over 300 primary immunodeficiencies reported. Although often rare, these profound immunodeficiencies stem from major functional aberrations at single genes and can be highly informative about immunological mechanisms and protection against specific infections.12, 13 There are also important examples of more common single-gene disorders that markedly influence infection-specific susceptibility; the best known is the protection afforded by sickle cell heterozygosity against falciparum malaria.14 A variant in the Duffy antigen gene promoter, which results in lack of erythrocyte surface expression, prevents binding by Plasmodium vivax, and is therefore protective.15, 16 More recently, a genetic variant that determines blood group secretor status has been shown to mediate susceptibility to Norwalk virus,17 and also to affect HIV progression independently of other chemokine variants.18\n",

Much of this expectation has yet to be realised, partly because of the methodological limitations of earlier studies and a tendency to examine individual genes in isolation and without consideration of their genetic and environmental milieu. Thus many reported genetic associations have not been replicated in subsequent studies.19 Understandably, some scepticism exists as to how much a genetic epidemiological approach can actually reveal about the genetic basis of complex diseases.20 However, there have been many recent advances in technology and\u2014more latterly\u2014its application; such studies have identified important protective and pathogenic pathways, and have led to individually targeted anti-infective therapies.

A study of the severity of common childhood infections, which used hospital admission as the phenotype, indicated that distinct genetic factors were likely to be involved in different infections, since the risk of admission in the second twin was only increased if the twins both had the same infectious diagnosis (Burgner D, unpublished). The concordance rates for common otolaryngological procedures such as myringotomy and adeno-tonsillectomy, which are surrogates for disease severity, also show greatly increased concordance in monozygotic twin pairs (Burgner D, unpublished). Twin studies of vaccine responses, in which the antigenic stimulus is unambiguous, indicate significant genetic influences on both humoral35 and cell-mediated36 responses. More detailed genetic studies indicate the importance of both HLA and non-HLA loci in vaccine responsiveness.37, 38 Studies in vitro of twins39 and first-degree relatives40 also show the importance of genetic factors in determining the innate immune responses to infectious stimuli.",

Intergenerational studies may circumvent this issue. A seminal study compared the risk and shared causes of premature mortality in children adopted very early in life with that of their biological and adoptive parents.41 The risk of an adopted child dying of infection was increased almost six times if their biological parent had also died prematurely of infection, whereas no increased risk was observed if the adoptive parent died of infection, suggesting that genetic rather than environmental factors are the important determinants of infectious disease mortality. Much smaller genetic effects were noted for cardiovascular disease and malignancy.41\n",

Genome-wide studies have the advantage that no supposition is made about the genes involved, and potentially novel or unconsidered genes may be identified. Typically, the genome-wide approach has used linkage studies of multiply affected (or infected) pedigrees to identify regions of the entire genome that are transmitted from the parents to the offspring more often than expected under independent inheritance.43 Typically, affected sibling pairs,57, 58 or larger multicase pedigrees59 if available, are recruited and the inherited regions of the genome are defined by a few hundred microsatellite markers. The main disadvantages of linkage studies are that sufficient numbers of affected sibling pairs may be difficult to recruit for many infections, and that linkage studies are often too insensitive to pick up the relatively small contributions from individual genetic regions that are typical of complex diseases such as infection. There are examples of successful genome scans undertaken using linkage analysis for infectious diseases, including the intensity of infection with Schistosoma mansoni,59 susceptibility to H pylori,60 and to leprosy.57, 58, 61 As with association data, some linkage studies have not been replicated in different populations. In some cases this may represent a false discovery rate, an inherent problem in studies that make multiple statistical comparisons, but it is increasingly clear that many complex diseases show genetic heterogeneity, with different genetic determinants for the same disease operating in different ethnic groups. For example, mutations in the NOD2/CARD15 locus, an important susceptibility determinant of inflammatory bowel disease in white populations, are effectively absent in Asian populations with the same phenotype.62\n",

This approach will potentially detect more subtle genetic effects than a classic linkage study.63 At present, studies use up to 0\u00b75 million of the approximately 11 million estimated SNPs in the human genome, but there are unresolved issues particularly relating to the optimum density and location for these SNP markers (gene-centric or evenly spaced through the genome), which have implications for how much of the genome such studies truly cover,45 as well as concerns regarding sample size and power.64 Genome-wide association studies have a high false discovery rate, and replication in independent populations is essential. There are currently no reported genome-wide association studies in infectious diseases, although such studies are underway. In particular, studies being undertaken under the banner of the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium will look at up to 2000 cases and 3000 controls for eight complex diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria.65 For these two important infectious diseases, a two-stage strategy is proposed in which a 750 000 SNP chip (panel) will be used to genotype 1000 cases and 1000 controls, and regions positive at p=0\u00b71 followed up in at least another 1000 cases and 1000 controls. This is one of the biggest projects ever undertaken to identify the genetic variations that may predispose people to, or protect them from, complex diseases. The hope is that by identifying these genetic signposts, researchers will be able to understand which people are most at risk, and also produce more effective treatments.",

For example, genotyping of almost 93 000 SNPs across the genome has identified a region of chromosome 6 associated with myocardial infarction. Further mapping identified a novel functional polymorphism in the lymphotoxin alpha (LTA) gene within this region and related functional variants in a ligand of LTA.66, 67 The odds ratio associated with the LTA mutation was 1\u00b778,67 an order of magnitude expected for a complex disease. In another study, a 120 000 SNP chip was used to compare 96 cases of age-related macular degeneration with 50 controls to identify a major gene (complement factor H) that determines susceptibility.68 A common intronic SNP among the 120 000 SNPs genotyped was strongly associated with disease, with a nominal p value of less than 10\u22127 (after correction for multiple testing), and a genotype relative risk for homozygous individuals of 7\u00b74 (95% CI 2\u00b79\u201319\u00b70). Re-sequencing revealed a polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with the risk allele that caused a tyrosine to histidine change at amino acid 402 in the complement factor H protein. The numbers of cases and controls studied was small, increasing the possibility of a false positive result (although the relative risk was high compared with our usual expectation for complex diseases). Importantly, the SNP-chip study was immediately supported by two studies using four independent case-control populations.69, 70\n",

The main practical objective of the HapMap project was to identify sets of SNPs that are in linkage disequilibrium with each other, so that a subset of these can be genotyped as so-called haplotype-tagging SNPs in a genome-wide association study, thus reducing the overall amount of genotyping required. The phase I data involved the genotyping of 1 million SNPs in unrelated individuals or parent/child trios of Nigerian, European, Chinese, and Japanese descent. Phase II extends this to 3\u00b75 million SNPs. The phase I data has already provided many predictions and tests of applicability of haplotype tagging across populations,72, 73 optimum sampling and two-stage testing strategies for whole genome association studies,74 and which commercially available SNP chips will work best. As predicted from previous studies, a greater density of SNPs on a chip is required to capture all the haplotypic diversity in the African population compared with European, Chinese, or Japanese populations, because of the greater diversity and shorter regions of linkage disequilibrium observed in the former,75 a factor that will be important in application of the technology to infectious disease association studies in Africa. Nevertheless, for 1000 cases and 1000 controls and a nominal p value of 0\u00b701, the phase I HapMap (eg, the newly released Sentrix human Hap300 genotyping beadchip by Illimuna;51 one SNP about every 12 kb) retains 77% power to detect associations due to common (\u22655%) causal alleles in the African population, compared with roughly 90% in European, Chinese, or Japanese populations.75 The 500 000 SNP chip from Affymetrix,50 which was made before the release of phase I HapMap haplotype-tagging SNP information, has about the same power as the Illumina human Hap300 chip (ie, it contains about two tags per haplotype).",

This does not imply that the HLA region necessarily influences manual dexterity, but more likely that the HLA type identifies an Asian subpopulation. This issue of population stratification is likely to be more confounded when small genetic effects are sought in large populations.81 However, this confounding can be minimised if cases and controls are carefully matched. The presence of genetic admixture can also be quantified from the genetic data itself,82 allowing stratified analyses if the sample size permits. In paediatric populations, an alternative approach is to use the parents as the genetic controls for their affected offspring.83 This approach is intrinsically less powerful than case-control designs, since the parental controls are enriched for the genetic variants of interest, but it allows inclusion of families of mixed ethnicity and potential pooling of data across ethnic groups, if significant genetic heterogeneity is not present.",

Evidence for selection was based on four tests of non-neutral evolution: (1) assessment of the percentage of SNPs within a locus with low (<10%) minor allele frequency and the percentage with high (>40%) minor allele frequency; (2) assessment of the frequency of derived (non-ancestral) alleles; (3) comparison of F\nST (panel) versus heterozygosity; and (4) relative extended haplotype homozygosity. In tests of allele frequency, three of the 168 genes stood out: IL9, FUT2, and CAV2. IL9 lies in the cluster of T-helper-2 related genes encoding interleukins 4, 5, 9, and 13 on chromosome 5q31-q33, which has been implicated in many infectious disease studies (table 2; webtables 1\u20134). FUT2 encodes a protein responsible for determining ABO blood protein secretor status, and variation in this gene may protect against respiratory pathogens,168\nH pylori,169 and HIV-1.170\nCAV2 encodes one of the caveolin proteins that function as scaffolding structures in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, which enhance immune cell function,168, 171 and are involved in pathogen entry into host cells.172 The relative extended haplotype homozygosity test provided the best evidence for selection, highlighting ABCC1 (or multidrug resistance protein MRP1, implicated in resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae in mice173), APCS (serum amyloid P component), and VAV3 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor expressed in haematopoietic and other cells, recently identified as a gene for type I diabetes in mice174) as genes with signatures of past selection. Although Walsh and colleagues3 discuss the limitations of their study and the need for validation, their research pilots the search for signatures of evolutionary selection that can now be undertaken in HapMap-style data, providing a real opportunity to identify the genes that have been under the strongest evolutionary pressure from infectious diseases. The advent of all these new technologies and tools offer exciting prospects for future research, allowing us to return to the drawing board in studying human genetic susceptibility to infectious disease. In so doing, it will be interesting to see how many of the candidate gene studies undertaken to date (webtables 1\u20134) are supported by potentially more powerful genome-wide association studies. Although a case can also be made for simply increasing sample size and power even with a more directed candidate gene approach, it is debatable whether the genes that show significant evidence of selection would have been readily chosen as obvious candidate loci. Thus, a combination of genome-wide, candidate gene, and other approaches may ultimately prove the most rewarding.",

The field of genetic epidemiology is increasingly acknowledging the importance of complex biological interactions in understanding genetic determinants. Gene\u2013gene interactions (epistasis) have been described for HIV infection, in which an HLA class I allele is associated with more rapid progression to AIDS only when an individual also carries a specific natural killer cell (KIR) receptor.175 Gene\u2013environment interactions have been shown in spontaneous preterm labour, which has an inflammatory basis. Although genetic variation at the tumour necrosis factor (TNFA) gene is associated with increased risk of preterm labour, this risk is increased significantly in the presence of bacterial vaginosis, itself an independent risk for the same outcome.176 In cystic fibrosis, those carrying functional variants of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) have worse pulmonary outcomes,177 and replacement MBL therapy has been reported in MBL-deficient cystic fibrosis patients.178 Not surprisingly, MBL exerts a protective effect through its innate immunological effects and in a recent small study, MBL deficiency only affected lung function when associated with Staphylococcus aureus colonisation,179 an example of a gene\u2013enviroment interaction.",

Analysis of the MHC led to the identification of a particular HLA haplotype that greatly increased the risk of abacavir hypersensitivity,181 and further mapping localised a functional variant in the peptide-binding groove of heat shock protein 70, which lies in the central MHC.182 Genotyping individuals for this variant before commencing abacavir is cost effective.183 Hopefully, further examples of clinically relevant pharmacogenetics in infectious diseases will be reported.

Power is calculated for different frequencies of risk alleles, and for samples of 500, 1500, or 3000 trios or case-control pairs. Power approximations for trios by a standard transmission disequilibrium test84 have been made using the method of Knapp.85 Theoretical power to detect allelic association was made assuming a multiplicative model. Results are given as a first approximation of the percentage power to detect allelic association at p=0\u00b701, p=0\u00b7001, or p=0\u00b70001. Power calculations were essentially identical for a similar size case-control sample. The advantage of trios is that they are not influenced by population admixture. The advantage of case-control analysis is one third less genotyping to obtain equivalent power. The graphs show that 500 trios or case-control pairs have very poor power to detect allelic association even for relatively common risk alleles (frequencies >0\u00b72). A sample of 1500 trios or case-control pairs has good power for risk alleles at frequencies >0\u00b71. A sample of 3000 trios or case-control pairs improves power for rare risk alleles (frequencies <0\u00b71).",
