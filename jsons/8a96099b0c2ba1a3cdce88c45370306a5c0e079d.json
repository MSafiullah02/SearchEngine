This quarantine-like intervention measure is especially feasible in countries and areas approaching malaria elimination. Motivated by mathematical models with quarantine for directly transmitted diseases, we develop a mosquito-borne disease model where imperfect quarantine is considered to mitigate the disease transmission from infected humans to susceptible mosquitoes. The basic reproduction number R 0 is computed and the model equilibria and their stabilities are analyzed when the incidence rate is standard or bilinear. In particular, the model system may undergo a subcritical (backward) bifurcation at R 0 = 1 when standard incidence is adopted, whereas the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable as R 0 \u2264 1 and the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable as R 0 > 1 when the infection incidence is bilinear.

Nowadays malaria is preventable, treatable and curable. Reducing the contacts of people with mosquitoes is the core strategy to prevent and control the spread of malaria. A number of precautions such as decreasing mosquito breeding sites, sleeping under insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying with insecticides, are used for reducing malaria vectors and their bites. The artemisinin-based combination therapies are recommended by WHO as the fist-line treatments for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (World Health Organization 2015) .

The earliest model was proposed by Ross in 1911 who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1902 for being the discoverer of the life cycle of malarial parasite (Ross 1911) . Macdonald extended Ross' basic model by considering superinfection and developed the entomological theory and the quantitative theory of malaria control (Macdonald 1957) . The so-called Ross-Macdonald model captures the essential feature of malaria transmission and the modeling framework has been widely adopted to study the epidemiology of malaria and other mosquito-borne or even vector-borne diseases (Reiner et al. 2013) . Dietz et al. (1974) and Aron (1988) conducted a modeling study on acquired immunity for whom has ever suffered from malaria. Aron and May (1982) formed an SIRS model with constant infection rate to fit data on age-prevalence curves. Ngwa and Shu (2000) established a compartmental model with an SEIRS pattern for humans and an SEI pattern for mosquitoes. Their model was later extended by Chitnis et al. (2006) through including constant immigration of susceptible humans and generalizing mosquito biting rate. Hasibeder and Dye (1988) and Gao et al. (2019) showed that nonhomogeneous mixing between humans and mosquitoes leads to a higher basic reproduction number using Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches, respectively. Ruan et al. (2008) proposed a delayed Ross-Macdonald model in consideration of the incubation periods of parasites within both humans and mosquitoes. Abu-Raddad et al. (2006) and Mukandavire et al. (2009) studied the influence of the interaction between HIV and malaria in a community. Differences in susceptibility, exposedness and infectivity between non-immune and semi-immune human hosts for malaria transmission were investigated by Ducrot et al. (2009) . Chamchod and Britton (2011) introduced a vector-bias model with vital dynamics to account for the greater attractiveness of infectious humans to mosquitoes. A theoretical model for evaluating the effectiveness of malaria control using genetically modified mosquitoes was developed and analyzed by Diaz et al. (2011) .

This measure is effective even for newly emerging infectious diseases caused by unidentified infectious agents. Quarantine has been widely used in the control of COVID-19, SARS, Ebola, Bubonic plague, measles, tuberculosis, H7N9, typhoid fever, etc. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of quarantine for controlling and eliminating infectious diseases.

The human population is divided into three classes: susceptible, infectious, and quarantined, while the mosquito population is divided into two classes: susceptible and infectious. We analyzed the dynamical behavior of the model in term of the basic reproduction number. Specifically, for the model with standard incidence, we obtained a sufficient condition for the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium E 0 and showed that the model can exhibit both forward and backward bifurcations at R 10 = 1. In addition, the disease is uniformly persistent and there exists a unique endemic equilibrium when R 10 > 1. In contrast, the model with bilinear incidence obeys the regular threshold dynamics. Namely, if R 20 \u2264 1, then the disease dies out; if R 20 > 1, then the disease persists and the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. We also used the second additive compound matrix method to establish the global stability of the endemic equilibrium under certain condition. Finally, three numerical examples on the standard incidence model were carried out to further explore the impact of quarantine on malaria persistence and control. The first example confirmed the occurrence of backward bifurcation with biologically acceptable parameter settings. The efficacies of the change in the three quarantine-related parameters, \u03b8, \u03b3 1 and \u03c3 , on reducing malaria cases were compared in the second example. In the last example, we performed both local and global sensitivity analyses on the basic reproduction number R 10 and found that the most sensitive parameter is the mosquito biting rate. Results suggest that the most important factor in achieving a successful quarantine for malaria is to reduce the biting rate of the quarantined people other than to quarantine more infected people at earlier infection stage. It is therefore very important to provide health advice (e.g., wear protective clothing and stay in mosquito-free accommodation) and essential supplies (e.g., insecticide-treated bed nets and mosquito repellent) to malaria patients such that the possibility of exposure to mosquito bites is dramatically reduced.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The two malaria models with quarantine only differ in incidence rate, but their dynamical behaviors can be substantially different, which highlights the importance of choosing the right biting rate or incidence rate function in mathematical modeling (Yang et al. 2017) . Generally speaking, if the ratio of mosquitoes to humans is small, then it is proper to choose the standard incidence. Otherwise, the bilinear or saturated incidence rate is a preferred choice (Chitnis et al. 2006) . Note that the Ross-Macdonald model (1) exhibits the global threshold dynamics in terms of R 0 , so quarantine is a new mechanism of backward bifurcation in mosquito-borne disease models (Gumel 2012) . The quarantine strategy is traditionally used for controlling diseases that are transmissible from human to human. We must address that quarantine is applicable to the control and elimination of malaria only if a low transmission region with a limited number of imported or autochthonous cases is concerned. For mosquito-borne diseases, we quarantine suspected and confirmed cases not these who have contacts with patients or have been exposed to malaria parasites with no symptoms.

Quarantined people who receive better treatment and care may have a shorter period of infectiousness or a lower parasitemia level. The use of quarantine is less beneficial when there is a high proportion of asymptomatic or subclinical infections. It is worth mentioning that modeling quarantine and/or isolation under exponential distribution assumption (EDA) may result in biased outcomes in understanding dynamic behaviors and assessing control measures (Feng et al. 2007) . Models that make no contradiction in terms of the basic reproduction number, endemic equilibrium, infectious period and other epidemiological characteristics, but remain mathematically tractable are most desirable.
