            "text": "March 11, 2020 [1] . South Korea has had a rapid surge in cases of COVID-19 since February 18, most of which were linked to the religious group called Shincheonji [2] . To date, 81% of total Korean cases occurred as clusters of cases [2] . Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) are vulnerable to cluster outbreaks. Because patients in LTCHs need continuous intimate cares, it is difficult to find facilities and healthcare personnel for their separate isolation care in a large outbreak situation. Furthermore, they are the risk group if infected. Although several drugs have been proposed as treatment regimens, there are no data on the effectiveness and safety of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for COVID-19.",
