During entry, S is cleaved into the N-terminal S1 region and C-terminal S2 region. S1 mediates binding to ACE2, and S2 mediates fusion of viral and host cell membranes [6, 7] . A region named S791 in this study corresponding to amino acid positions 620 to 900 of S contains cleavage sites for S1 and S2 domains [8] . S791 also contains an epitope recognized by serum samples from convalescing patients with SARS in Vietnam [9] . The S protein also plays an important role in inducing protective immunity [10] [11] [12] . Antibodies targeting the S1 domain, however, also induced antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV entry into the host cells when the amino acid sequences of S proteins were changed [13, 14] .",

After adsorption for 1 h, the cultures were overlaid with 1% methylcellulose-containing media and incubated for 6-8 days at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then fixed with 20% formalin, stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 0.1 M citric acid, and irradiated with UV light for 1 h. After drying, the numbers of virus plaques were counted. The neutralizing titer was defined as the reciprocal dilution of serum causing a 50% reduction in the plaque count, compared with the negative control. In the neutralization assay against SARS-CoV PUMC01, cell monolayers were stained with 100 lL of 0.15% neutral red (Sigma) in DMEM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing, 100 lL of acid alcohol (1% acetic acid in 50% ethanol) was added to each well. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the absorbance of neutral red-stained plates was read at 450 nm.",

In contrast, 5H10 reacted with a peptide corresponding to amino acid positions 791 to 805 of the S protein (PLKPTKRSFIEDLLF) (data not shown). The latter peptide was identical to that recognized by the serum samples from convalescing patients with SARS in Vietnam [9] . Furthermore, the amino acid R797 is the trypsin proteolytic site to enhance fusion of the virus [8] . Among the 3 mAbs, only 5H10 showed in vitro SARS-CoV neutralizing activity, and the 50% effective concentration was 5 lg/mL (Supplemental Fig. 1d) . These results indicated that 5H10 recognizing the proteolytic site of the S protein is a potent fully human neutralizing mAb against SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "The epitope of 5H10 was identified at amino acid position 791-805 in the S protein. This sequence is highly conserved among not only SARS-CoV strains from patients but also among CoV strains in general [28] and contains a critical cleavage site, which induces exposure of the fusion peptide on cleavage [10, 28] . 5H10 inhibited cell-cell fusion mediated by the interaction between S and ACE2 even in the presence of trypsin, although the inhibition was not effective if cells were treated with 5H10 before detachment by trypsin in addition to EDTA. Indeed, 5H10 did not efficiently inhibit the cleavage and reacted with cleaved S. Our observations suggested that 5H10 prevents viral fusion and entry into the host cells but not viral attachment to the host cells or cleavage of S. Antibodies recognizing epitopes located in the ACE2-binding domain induced antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV entry into the host cells when the amino acid sequences of the S proteins were changed [13, 14] . Our results indicated that targeting of the S protein region involved in mediating viral fusion would provide a feasible strategy to produce neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, which is robust to mutation of the virus. Because synergistic effects of combinations of mAbs directed toward the ACE2 binding domain of S have been reported [15, 29] , 5H10 directed toward the S cleavage site may serve as an alternative combination to provide stronger synergistic effects. The Rhesus macaque model used here mirrors the sequence of pathogenesis in humans with SARS [22, 30, 31] . Clear clinical relevance of this model was observed in most of the parameters studied, such as elevated body temperature, lung pathology, and SARS-CoV antigen detection in the lung tissue samples, indicating that it is a valuable model for evaluation of candidate therapeutic agents. Administration of 5H10 significantly suppressed the SARS-CoV-induced pathogenesis in the SARS Rhesus model. Thus, 5H10 is sufficiently effective to prevent SARS-CoV infection in the primate model. Because significant amounts of human anti-SARS antibody were detected even 2 weeks after administration, 5H10 has a sufficient half-life for use in prophylaxis and for therapeutic purposes. Thus, 5H10 is a promising agent for use against the reemergence of SARS.",

In this study, we produced 5H10 using a recombinant protein prepared in an E. coli expression system. This study represents a platform to produce fully human antibodies against emerging infectious diseases in a timely manner as (1) the recombinant proteins used in this study containing an antigenic epitope identified in the patients' serum samples and produced by E. coli to avoid the handling of large amount of hazardous SARS-CoV as the antigen, and (2) use of transgenic animals producing fully human antibodies makes it possible to rapidly produce fully human antibodies, which is essentially safe for clinical applications.",
