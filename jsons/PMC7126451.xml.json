However, this practice has to face with a hard and very well organized frontier, the mucosa: a mucus secreting epithelium that lines the internal parts of the body. The intestinal mucosa is made up of epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosae. The epithelium is constituted by cells that are held together by tight junctions, which effectively form a seal against the external environment. In addition, there are two extra levels of protection against the outer milieu, the secreted mucus layer and the apical glycocalyx (Fig. 1\n). Globally considered these layers constitute the mucus that covers the tips of microvilli on the apical surfaces of intestinal enterocytes [2]. Mucus provides a barrier against physical and chemical aggressors, such as food residues, host secreted digestive products (e.g. bile acids and enzymes), but also against the potentially noxious microbiota and their products. Not surprisingly, pathogens have evolved many ways of evading the mucosal barrier. In fact, mucosae cover 400 m2 in the human host, and as a consequence is the major portal of entry of the majority of known pathogens [3], [4].",

Mucins, secreted by goblet cells, are densely glycosylated proteins in which the protein backbone (apomucin) is linked to a number of carbohydrate chains (50\u201390% by weight) [7], [8]. In addition the carbohydrate structures themselves can be either linear or branched, and can be acidic (containing sialic acid or sulphate groups) or neutral in nature [7], [8]. The degree and type of glycosylation differs depending on the type of mucin and its localization throughout the gut [9]. These glycoproteins can be found as oligomers or non-oligomers, and are initially classified into three subfamilies: soluble (3\u201310 nm long), membrane-bound (100\u2013500 nm), and, gel-forming mucins (up to several micrometres). Gel-forming mucins are the major constituent of mucus and responsible for its viscoelastic properties [10].",

Consequently, mucin fibres are flexible and sticky. The energy invested by mucosal tissues in the production of mucins, and the finely tuned modulation in response to chemical physical or biological challenges, such as infections, reflects the importance of these glycoproteins. In fact, changes in mucin glycosylation are considered as mechanisms of the innate immune response to mucosal infections [10]. In any case, mucus layers are not insurmountable for the microbial world. Motility and degradative enzymes are main strategies used by many microbial pathogens to penetrate the mucus layers that we will considered in the following section.",

Some great examples of how to avoid size exclusion conferred by the mucus mesh are obtained from enteric virus. In fact, virions that use intestine mucosa to colonize the host have regular sizes below 200 nm (i.e., Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Influenza, and Norwalk). This fact suggests that the mucus barrier has positively selected virus with sizes that better penetrate the mesh to reach efficiently the subjacent target cells. However, some particulates of up to 400 nm are also able to diffuse through mucus [17]. These circumstances are related with the physico-chemical properties of mucin, such as the molecular charge, density of anionic and cationic groups, and the numerous hydrophobic domains distributed over the surface of the fibres [16], [18]. As a result, adhesive interactions of particles with mucus can be achieved by electrostatic and/or hydrophobic interactions as follows.",

In a similar way, H. pylori attaches to mucin carbohydrates by the blood-group antigen-binding and the sialic acid binding adhesins at neutral pH.

These M cells are specialized for \u201cantigen sampling\u201d, presenting a reduced density of microvilli [3], [47]. In addition, this dome epithelium lacks goblet cells, thus making a specialized sampling area where the mucus barrier is minimal. Another related special feature of M cells is that they present a deep invagination at the basolateral side, forming an intraepithelial pocket containing immunocompetent cells.

Nonetheless, natural LPS from different bacteria may exhibit different biological properties, including their capability as TLR agonist or their effect as pyrogenic material [72], [73]. On the other hand, nontoxic alternatives have been developed including the synthesis of modified products structurally related to LPS but devoid of its toxicity. In this way, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL, derivative of LPS from Salmonella enterica serovar. Minnesota) was the first TLR ligand and biological adjuvant approved for human use for its safety and effectiveness [74], [75].

In a similar way, Sarti and co-workers, using PLGA nanoparticles associated to MPL, demonstrated an important improvement of the immune response against ovalbumin (OVA) only when the LPS derivative was present [79]. Interestingly, these results were obtained with the administration of one single oral dose. In another study, PLGA-lipid nanocarriers functionalized in surface with MPL and a M-cell specific lectin stimulated effective mucosal and serum antibodies against the model antigen in mice [80].

However, to the best of our knowledge, researches about their use as an oral vaccine delivery system are limited. Another approach to take advantage of the adjuvant potential of LPS is the use of molecules with low toxicity. In this context, it has been proposed the use of the rough LPS from Brucella ovis, which shows a very low endotoxicity [73]. This LPS was used to decorate poly(anhydride) nanoparticles carrying OVA as model allergen. Orally administered to mice, LPS-coated nanoparticles were capable to reach in a large extent the surface of the intestinal epithelium, including PP [68]. More important, this capability to reach the epithelium was in line with the very high degree of protection offered by LPS-nanoparticles (close to 90%) against an anaphylactic shock in OVA-sensitized animals [68]. In a similar approach, but using a Lolium perenne protein extract, the coating of poly(anhydride) nanoparticles with LPS from B. ovis shifted the immune response from a Th2 (observed with naked nanoparticles) to a Th1 profile in a sensitized murine model to this allergen [83]. This cellular response induced with LPS-coated nanoparticles was identified as the key aspect responsible for the efficacy of the nanoparticles. In fact, in the challenge experiment with sensitized mice, LPS-nanocarriers decreased both the levels of mMCP-1 (mouse mast cell protease 1) and the severity of the anaphylactic symptoms, increasing the survival rate of animals compared with the controls [83].",

When administered orally, these nanocarriers displayed an important capability to reach the surface of the epithelium, mainly in the ileum of laboratory animals. Interestingly, the distribution profile of these nanoparticles within the gut correlated well with the described colonization profile for Salmonella Enteritidis [90], [91], including a broad concentration in PP. Using ovalbumin as model antigen, these flagellin-coated nanoparticles elicited a strong and balanced secretion of both IgG2a (Th1) and IgG1 (Th2) specific antibodies. Furthermore, these nanoparticles were able to induce a much more strong mucosal IgA response than naked nanoparticles [92].",

Thus, mannosylated niosomes loaded with tetanus toxoid (TT) were evaluated as oral vaccines against tetanus [102]. The coating of these vesicles with a linear polymer of mannose (o-palmitoyl mannan) improved their stability in the presence of bile salts and digestive enzymes. Furthermore, the functionalized nanocarriers were capable to target PP and to elicit important humoral and cellular responses as measured of the IgG2a/IgG1 sera levels. Similarly, the IgA levels in mucosal secretions were also high against TT [102]. In a similar work, the same mannosylated niosomes were evaluated as oral vaccine carrier of a plasmid designed for the expression of hepatitis B virus proteins. Only animals immunized with these mannosylated niosomes offered adequate antibody levels to get seroprotection against hepatitis B virus infection [103]. Mannosylated liposomes have also been proposed for oral vaccination. Thus, liposomes functionalized with a mannose derivative (mannose-PEG-cholesterol conjugate) induced potent immune responses against a model antigen (bovine serum albumin, BSA) when orally administered. These immune responses were characterized by high levels of both sera IgG and sIgA in different mucosal secretions [104].",

The vaccination of mice with a single oral dose of these nanocarriers offered an important protection against an experimental infection with the bacteria. In fact, the degree of protection (measured as reduction of B. ovis CFU in the spleen) obtained with mannosylated nanoparticles was about 10-times higher than for naked nanoparticles and 100-times higher than for the control [105]. However, when the animals were conjunctivally vaccinated with mannosylated nanoparticles the degree of protection against the challenge was the highest, even than that observed for the commercial vaccine intramuscularly administered. This degree of protection was related with the fact that mannosylated nanoparticles, after their instillation in the eyes, were distributed (via the nasolacrimal duct) to both the nose and the gastrointestinal tract. In fact, 4 h after instillation, nanoparticles were visualized in the cornea, nose and intestinal mucosa, including PP [105]. It is important to highlight that in all of these areas, nanoparticles can encounter APCs and, thus, induce and potentiate the immune response.",

It may, therefore, be possible to exploit these surface exposed carbohydrate residues as targets for lectin-mediated delivery to specific regions and cell-types within the gastrointestinal tract. Several studies have revealed that, in many species and at many MALT sites, the M cell surface glycocalyx differs in carbohydrate composition from that of enterocytes [108], [109]. One of the first attempt to evaluate the capability of lectins to specifically target M-cells was the coating of liposomes [110] and nanoparticles [111] with Ulex europaeus I agglutinin (UEA1), a lectin specific for \u03b1-l-fucose residues [112]. Using model antigens (e.g. OVA or BSA), UEA1 coated particulates were capable to reach and target M cells in PP [113] and induced systemic humoral responses significantly higher than those elicited with non-targeted antigen [114], [115]. More recently, Malik and coworkers have demonstrated that the coating of BSA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles with UEA1 conjugated alginate produced nanocarriers capable to induce superior systemic responses in laboratory animals along with a mucosal immunity significantly higher than that induced by a conventional aluminium-based vaccine [116]. All of these immunity effects would be consequence of a rapid endocytosis process of these nanocarriers after adhesion to M cells that would facilitate their capture by mucosal DCs and other immunocompetent cells in the subepithelial dome of the intestinal PP tissue [117], [80].",

In fact, gut mucosal surfaces are the major portal of entry for the majority of known pathogens and allergens, acting mucosae as the first line of the immune response (GALT). Nevertheless, the arrival of antigens or allergens to the GALT has to face to a number of barriers. First, these compounds are highly sensitive to the harsh conditions of the gut and, in general, they are rapidly degraded by extreme pH conditions and/or digestive enzymes. Second, the mucus layer constitutes a formidable hurdle that greatly hampers the encounter and interaction of these antigens and/or allergens with the antigen presenting cells. Third, the antigens have to elicit a strong, long-lasting and adequate (protective) immune response.",

Nanocarriers (e.g. polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and ISCOMs) are a good option to protect the cargo against its early degradation within hostile environmental conditions (e.g. acidic pH, enzymes). However, when these nanocarriers are orally administered, they interact with the mucin fibres and, then, an important fraction of the given dose remains trapped in the protective mucus layer. As a consequence, these nanocarriers are rapidly eliminated by the physiological mucus turn-over and the gut peristaltism.",

Basically, bacteria and virus use two types of mucus-permeating strategies. The first set includes particular physico-chemical properties to minimize the interaction with components of the mucus layer (e.g. size, surface charge and a hydrophilic character). The second set encompasses biological solutions such as the release of proteolytic/glycosidic enzymes, the use of propeller systems, and the presence of compounds capable of specifically interact with receptors of the host. However, it is interesting to note that, in general, microorganisms do not use a simple and unique strategy but a combination of them to cross the mucus layer.",

For this purpose, the ligands (e.g. glycoconjugates, flagellin, LPS, lectins) should be covalently bound to the surface of nanocarriers loaded with the biologically active molecules. Important advantages can be obtained from this combination.",

In case of flagellin and LPS, and due to their capability to decrease the synthesis of mucins, it can be hypothesized that they could also decrease the viscosity of the mucus layer, favouring the arrival of the nanocarriers to the epithelium. Second, the capability of these ligands to specifically interact with PRR on the cell surface (e.g. TLR, MR, glycoconjugates) would improve the possibilities of the resulting nanocarriers to reach the GALT, including M cells in PP. Thus, these targeting properties would be in line with the colonization pattern observed for microorganisms in their colonization process of the host gut mucosa, facilitating the antigen presentation and the activation of the immune system. Last but not least, the immunoadjuvant properties of these ligands would boost the protective immune response.",

This combination should increase the fraction of such nanocarriers capable of reaching the surface of the epithelium and, thus, the efficacy of the antigen/allergen delivery system. However the binding of a second compound to the surface of nanocarriers may negatively affect to their targeting properties and, indeed, their efficacy. Further research is necessary in order to implement adequate methodologies to \u201cdecorate\u201d nanocarriers with different compounds without loss of their efficacy as mucosal delivery systems as well as to select the most adequate ligand to boost the more appropriate immunity to a pathogen or allergy.",
