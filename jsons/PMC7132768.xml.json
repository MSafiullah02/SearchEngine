Accordingly, when faced with a patient with vomiting, the differential is broad and includes gastrointestinal, infectious, central nervous system, drug reaction, and cardiac origins (Table 1\n). While the most common causes of nausea and vomiting are acute gastroenteritis, febrile systemic illness, and drug effects,5 one must also consider certain critical and emergent diagnoses such as Boerhaave syndrome, intracranial bleed or raised intracranial pressure, meningitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, myocardial ischemia, sepsis, gonadal torsion, abdominal inflammatory processes, bowel obstruction, adrenal insufficiency, and toxic ingestions.",

The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommends a pragmatic 3-step approach to the management of the patient with nausea and vomiting.6 After a complete history and physical examination, the clinician should first correct any complications of vomiting such as hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypovolemia, ketosis, or vitamin deficiencies. Second, the underlying cause should be sought with the intention of initiating targeted therapy. The third step is the initiation of treatment strategies to suppress the symptoms. Although there are no clinical guidelines in the initial workup of the patient with vomiting, pregnancy testing should be considered in women of reproductive age. Serum electrolytes, complete blood count, liver function tests, lipase, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram may also be considered depending on the clinical situation.",

For the empiric treatment of undifferentiated vomiting, the pharmaceutical armamentarium consists of many different drug classes primarily directed at 5 neurotransmitter receptor sites (Table 2\n). Before the recent increase in use of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonists, the mainstay of therapy had been dopamine receptor antagonists. The literature on this class of medications is vast and at times contradictory. One of the most extensively studied drugs is metoclopramide (Reglan). Metoclopramide has been compared with prochlorperazine (Compazine), with some investigators finding similar efficacy7, 8 and others finding a modest benefit of one over the other.9, 10, 11 Metoclopramide is often recommended for pregnant patients, as it is the only medication in this class with a pregnancy category B rating.",

Other studies have shown a higher rate of akathisia and dystonia with prochlorperazine compared with other antiemetics.13, 14 In an ED-based study of 229 patients receiving prochlorperazine, 16% developed akathisia and 4% developed acute dystonia.15 Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is the first-line choice to treat these reactions. A study of 82 patients with akathisia found diphenhydramine was effective in reducing akathisia from 9.8 to 1.2 on a scale of 0 to 17.16 These findings have led some clinicians to administer diphenhydramine concurrently with prochlorperazine in an effort to prevent akathisia; however, this practice has not been validated with a randomized, placebo-controlled study.",

Of the currently approved drugs in the United States, ondansetron (Zofran), granisetron (Granisol, Kytril), and dolasetron (Anzemet) have all been shown to be equally effective and tolerated.19, 20, 21 Palonosetron (Aloxi) differs from the others in this class by its longer half-life, and has been shown to reduce delayed chemotherapy-induced vomiting when compared with dolasetron.22 Although the bulk of the research on this class of drugs comes from the oncology literature for chemotherapy-induced vomiting,23, 24 studies examining undifferentiated ED patients have recently been published. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial found ondansetron was not superior to metoclopramide and promethazine in 163 patients presenting to the ED with undifferentiated nausea.25 Furthermore, a 2008 study of 120 ED patients found no difference in the reduction of nausea between ondansetron and promethazine, however, the group that received ondansetron experienced less sedation.26 A recent review article examined the evidence supporting the use of droperidol, promethazine, prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, and ondansetron for the treatment of nausea or vomiting in the ED. The investigators concluded that \u201cbased on the safety and efficacy of ondansetron, it may be used as a first-line agent for relief of nausea or vomiting for most patient populations in the ED.\u201d27\n",

Furthermore, diarrhea caused by C difficile may present with severe abdominal pain, high fever, and more than 10 watery stools per day; however, as it is common among elderly patients many or all of these signs and symptoms may be absent. One study found 15% of patients with diarrhea hospitalized at an academic center tested positive for C difficile,\n45 while during times of outbreak more than 50% of patients in an affected ward may become colonized.46 Of interest, although C difficile historically has not been thought of as a pediatric illness, recent evidence suggests the contrary. A pediatric ED-based study found that of specimens that underwent complete testing, 12.4% tested positive for C difficile toxin,47 and nearly 3% of children tested positive for C difficile toxin in another similar study from France.48 Recently a new disease pattern, community-onset C difficile\u2013associated diarrhea, has emerged, and may occur without exposure to the typical risk factors including antibiotic usage.49\n",

Campylobacter jejuni, a bacteria that poses additional hazards because it has been implicated with acute cases of myocarditis, has emerged as another important cause of traveler\u2019s diarrhea.56 Electrolyte disturbances for patients with traveler\u2019s diarrhea are rare, and therefore laboratory work is usually unnecessary.57 Treatment of traveler\u2019s diarrhea is centered on antibiotic therapy, such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim; resistance common), azithromycin (Zithromax), and rifaximin (Xifaxan).58 If the patient with suspected traveler\u2019s diarrhea has more than 2 unformed stools per day, bloody stools, or fever (>37.8\u00b0C), treatment with antibiotics is advised.59 A short, single-day course of ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice a day, is usually successful at stopping the illness within 24 hours,60 although other sources recommend a 3-day course of ciprofloxacin or rifaximin.61 Prophylactic administration of antibiotics for those traveling to developing countries is not typically recommended. However, in one placebo-controlled trial performed on United States travelers in Mexico, subjects who took rifaximin prophylactically had significantly reduced rates of diarrhea (53.70% for those taking placebo vs 14.74% for those taking rifaximin).62 Nonetheless, C difficile and Helicobacter pylori must also be on the differential among the traveler afflicted with diarrhea. Noninfectious origins need to be considered if there is no response to antimicrobials or antiparasitics and there is a protracted course. Nonbacterial causes include enteric viruses, viral hepatitis, influenza, giardia, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Entamoeba, Strongyloides, and other less common parasites.",

Nevertheless, one meta-analysis found that when combined with antibiotic therapy, loperamide was more efficacious than antibiotics alone in decreasing illness duration for adult patients with traveler\u2019s diarrhea.76 Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in the treatment of pediatric patients with diarrhea, as they have potentially serious side effects in this population.77\n",

While a 2007 review revealed a small number of publications addressing the etiologic factors of this very common problem,92 it was suggested that insufficient dietary fiber intake, inadequate fluid intake, decreased physical activity, side effects of drugs, hypothyroidism, sex hormones, and colorectal cancer obstruction may be responsible for constipation.92 Furthermore, the cause of constipation may also be related to abnormal bowel motility, anatomical rectal disorders, neurological disorders, or psychosocial issues (Table 3\n). A thorough review of the patient\u2019s medications is advisable, as there are many different medications that secondarily contribute to constipation, such as calcium and iron supplements, opioids, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and antihistamines.88 Constipation resistant to simple measures may be caused by painful anorectal conditions, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), slow transit constipation, or obstructive defecation. Obstructed defecation is a broad term used to describe the inability to empty stool from the rectum, which may result from functional, metabolic, mechanical, or anatomical problems.93 Mechanical and anatomical disorders causing obstructive defecation include Hirschsprung disease, rectocele, rectoanal intussusception, enterocele, sigmoidocele, and rectal prolapse.94 Studies have found that obstructive defecation is a significant problem for middle-aged women. Obstructive defecation was self-reported and defined by difficulty in passing stool, hard stool, straining for more than 15 minutes, or incomplete evacuation, occurring at least weekly. In this study of 2109 subjects, 12.3% of women reported obstructive defecation at least once weekly. Risk factors correlated with patients developing obstructive defecation included a history of IBS, vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, unemployment, use of 3 or more medications, symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse, history of urinary incontinence surgery, or other pelvic surgeries.95\n",

However, diarrhea and bloating were more common in the higher-dose group.117 A second study on PEG for children with constipation found low-dose PEG (0.2 g/kg/d) was successful in 77% of patients, mid-dose PEG (0.4 g/kg/d) was successful in 74% of patients, and high-dose PEG (0.8 g/kg/d) was successful in 73% of patients.

Up to 30% of exposed individuals shed the virus before developing the illness, and patients with underlying illnesses or immunocompromised states may continue to do so long after the illness resolves.126 Noroviruses survive in a variety of temperatures, remaining live on environmental surfaces, in recreational and drinking water, and on raw fruits and vegetables. Although patients may develop illness year-round, outbreaks tend to peak during periods of cold weather.124 Norovirus illness usually presents with both vomiting and diarrhea, as well as abdominal cramps, malaise, myalgias, and chills. Symptom onset is sudden, with vomiting being more common in children and diarrhea more common in adults.124\n",

E coli 0157:H7 primarily affects children younger than 10 years and elderly patients, with an incidence of 0.99 per 100,000 persons in the United States in 2009.140 Transmission has been linked to the consumption of undercooked beef, contaminated drinking water, unpasteurized milk,150, 151 and from fecal contamination of raw vegetables and unpasteurized apple juice.152, 153\nE coli 0157:H7 bacteria cause a hemorrhagic colitis due to a shiga-like cytotoxin that destroys the colonic microvilli. Patients infected with E coli may develop an acute onset of watery diarrhea, which may progress to bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and vomiting. Fever is typically absent or low grade. Approximately 6% of patients with E coli 0157:H7 infection, particularly those younger than 5 years and elderly patients, develop hemolytic uremic syndrome.154 This risk is increased with bloody diarrhea, leukocytosis, fever, and possibly the use of antimotility agents.155, 156\n",

In this study, length of hospital stay (median: 5.5 days) was independent of the pathogen, but was associated with patients who had underlying medical conditions.157 Another study evaluated 29 acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in childcare centers. Stool specimens from symptomatic children and environmental surface swabs found offending pathogens included rotavirus (17% of outbreaks), norovirus (10%), astrovirus (10%), and sapovirus (7%). In 3 of the outbreaks, 10% of patients were found to have multiple viruses responsible for their infection, highlighting the importance of surveillance monitoring during these occurrences.128\n",

The scale assesses 4 characteristics: general appearance, eyes, mucous membranes, and tears. If all of these are normal, the score is zero, and the child is determined to have no dehydration. A score of 1 is given in each category if the child appears thirsty or restless, has slightly sunken eyes, sticky mucous membranes, or decreased tears. A score of 2 is given in each category if the child has a drowsy, limp, cold, or sweaty appearance, has very sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes, or absent tears.

Common household fluids such as tea, fruit juice, sports drinks, and soft drinks have too little sodium along with a higher carbohydrate and osmolality content than suggested, and should therefore be avoided when attempting to hydrate a child with diarrhea.28, 29 In children with severe dehydration (more than 10% body weight loss), intravenous fluids are recommended. A 20 mL/kg bolus of intravenous fluid is suggested except in the case of a malnourished infant, where 10 mL/kg as a starting resuscitative amount is recommended to avoid overhydration or heart failure. After the initial intravenous therapy, 100 mL/kg oral rehydration solution over 4 hours or D5\u00bdNS (dextrose 5% in 0.45% normal saline) intravenously at a rate of twice maintenance may be administered.",
