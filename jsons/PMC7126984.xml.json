After normalisation to GAPDH, aloe-emodin-treated cells showed an increase of 1294.4-fold of PKR mRNA and 8.6-fold of OAS mRNA compared with untreated HL-CZ cells, respectively. Moreover, aloe-emodin induced a more than two-fold increase in the level of the PKR mRNA compared with activation by shikonin, arecoline and hesperetin (P\n < 0.001). The result suggested that aloe-emodin more potently activated the expression of ISGs (PKR and OAS) than shikonin, arecoline and hesperetin.",

IC50 values of aloe-emodin against JEV replication were 0.50 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcg/mL in HL-CZ cells and 1.51 \u00b1 0.05 \u03bcg/mL in TE-671 cells. IC50 values of shikonin for inhibition of JEV replication were 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcg/mL in HL-CZ cells and 2.1 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/mL in TE-671 cells. In addition, IC50 values of arecoline were 10.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcg/mL in HL-CZ cells and 32.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcg/mL in TE-671 cells. On the other hand, IC50 values of aloe-emodin for inhibition of EV71 replication were 0.52 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcg/mL in HL-CZ cells and 0.14 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcg/mL in TE-671 cells. The therapeutic index (TI) of aloe-emodin for anti-JEV activity was >1500, whilst the TI for anti-EV71 activity was >5000. Moreover, aloe-emodin had higher TI values against JEV and EV71 than shikonin and arecoline. In the time-dependent assay, aloe-emodin significantly inhibited the early stages of JEV and EV71 replication in TE-671 and HL-CZ cells at a low concentration (1 \u03bcg/mL) (Fig. 2). The results demonstrated that aloe-emodin potently inhibited in vitro JEV and EV71 replication in a dose- and time-dependent manner.",

The anti-JEV mechanism of shikonin was not clearly found to be associated with activation of in vivo ISRE, GAS and NF-\u03baB signalling pathways (Fig. 1B). However, shikonin (1 \u03bcg/mL) increased levels of PKR and OAS in HL-CZ cells by 1087- and 5-fold, respectively, compared with mock cells. Shikonin was hypothesised to be an effective inhibitor of protein\u2013protein interactions with multiple targets in both the intracellular and extracellular compartments owing to several therapeutic applications [13]. Therefore, we suggest that the mechanism of anti-JEV activity of shikonin could involve multiple targets for anti-JEV activity. Arecoline, a major areca nut alkaloid, showed less anti-JEV efficacy than aloe-emodin and shikonin (Table 1). Arecoline has been demonstrated to activate the GAS signalling pathway (Fig. 1B) and to enhance NO production. However, several side effects of arecoline have been reported, such as immunosuppression, hepatotoxicity, depression of antioxidant status and attenuation of cytochrome P450 1A1 activation in liver cells [14].",
