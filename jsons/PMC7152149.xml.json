Nasal sprays containing decongestants should be used for no more than 3 days, to avoid a rebound vasomotor rhinitis. Cough syrups containing expectorants are of unproven value in common colds. Symptoms of sneezing and rhinorrhea can be alleviated with nonselective antihistamines such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, or clemastine fumarate,1 but treatment with selective H1 inhibitors is not effective. Studies of pseudoephedrine have demonstrated measurable improvements in nasal air flow consistent with a decongestant effect.2 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen moderate the systemic symptoms of rhinovirus infection. However, the use of the decongestant phenylpropanolamine has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke.3 Topical application of ipratropium, a quaternary anticholinergic agent that is minimally absorbed across biologic membranes, reduces rhinorrhea significantly in naturally occurring colds. This agent probably exerts its major effect on the parasympathetic regulation of mucous and seromucous glands. Importantly, most over-the-counter cough and cold remedies have not been studied in pediatric populations, where they may be associated with significant side effects.4\n",

Also characteristic of this disease is marked tracheitis, bronchitis, or tracheobronchitis, as well as rhinitis and conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis is not a feature of infection with the other major respiratory viruses and therefore, when present, is a useful diagnostic finding in adenovirus respiratory disease. With adenovirus respiratory disease, the conjunctivitis is typically mild and follicular, although some adenovirus types also cause the more severe condition, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Fever, chills, myalgia, and prostration are prominent features of adenovirus infection, so it is often perceived by the patient as a \u201cflulike\u201d illness or an unusually severe cold.",

In mismatched solid organ transplant recipients (seronegative recipient/seropositive donor), posttransplant prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir or its prodrug valganciclovir significantly reduces the risk of CMV disease, although late-onset disease still happens.83 Another strategy is preemptive therapy with ganciclovir or another anti-CMV agent when screening detects infection, but before clinically detectable disease develops.

Antigenic variation principally involves the two external glycoproteins of the virus, the HA and NA, and is referred to as antigenic drift or antigenic shift, depending on whether the variation is small or great. Antigenic drift refers to relatively minor antigenic changes that result from amino acid changes in one or more of the five identified major antigenic sites on the HA molecule.128 Antigenic shift refers to the complete replacement of the HA or NA with a novel HA or NA. These viruses are \u201cnew\u201d viruses to which the population has no specific immunity. When such a new virus is introduced into a population, a severe, worldwide epidemic, or pandemic, of influenza can result. Influenza pandemics in the 20th century include the H1N1 pandemic of 1918, the H2N2 pandemic of 1957, and the H3N2 pandemic of 1968. Extensive surveillance and sequence information suggests that these new HA and NA genes are introduced into viruses circulating in humans from resident populations of influenza A viruses in birds.129\n",

In the spring of 2009, a novel H1N1 virus containing genes from viruses of swine, avian, and human origin emerged. Importantly, the HA gene of this virus was derived from swine influenza virus. Although still an H1N1 virus, the novel, or pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) was antigenically distinct from the human H1N1 viruses in circulation since 1977. Instead, the HA was closely related to human H1 viruses from the early 20th century that had been introduced into pigs in approximately 1918 and had not undergone significant antigenic evolution in these animals since that time.

Influenza B viruses are somewhat less sensitive than influenza A viruses but are well within clinically achievable concentrations. Avian viruses with all nine known neuraminidase subtypes are also sensitive. Although zanamivir and oseltamivir have an identical mechanism of action and similar profile of antiviral activity, they have differing pharmacologic properties. Zanamivir is not orally bioavailable and is administered as a dry powder for oral inhalation, using the so-called \u201cdiskhaler\u201d device. Oseltamivir phosphate is an orally bioavailable ethyl ester prodrug that is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and converted in the liver by hepatic esterases to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate. The metabolite is excreted unchanged in the urine by tubular secretion, with a serum half-life of 6 to 10 hours.",

Epidemics are associated with increases in pediatric hospitalizations and deaths due to lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children.243 Nearly 50% of children are infected within the first year of life, and almost all have been infected by 3 years of age. Reinfections in children and adults are quite common even with the same strain,244 suggesting immunity is only partial. Epidemiologic factors related to serious illness in infected infants include low socioeconomic status, crowding, maternal smoking, lack of breast feeding, day care center attendance, and history of allergic disease. RSV is also recognized as a cause of severe disease in older adults245 and may result in a greater total burden of mortality in the elderly than in infants.125\n",

Low-affinity antibodies may also have contributed to immune complex formation and deposition, leading to local inflammation.269, 270 Formalin-inactivated RSV also primes a T helper 2 response, with high levels of interleukin 4 and interleukin 5, which can promote inflammation of small airways.271 Although this adverse experience has prompted extra caution, current RSV vaccine development efforts are ongoing and focus on live attenuated and recombinant subunit vaccines.",
