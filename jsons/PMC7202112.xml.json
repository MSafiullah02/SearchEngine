Since the 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1 subtype) pandemic of the influenza virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines state that health care providers (HCP), when performing or participating in procedures that are associated with pathogen generating aerosols (aerosol-generating procedures [AGPs]), should wear an N95 filter mask and consider PAPR. AGPs include performance of the following procedures in patients with acute respiratory diseases2: intubation and related procedures, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, bronchoscopies, surgeries, and autopsies.",

We can confirm that in Mexico, there have been \u201chospital outbreaks\u201d with 329 HCPs who have been infected with COVID-19 throughout the country.
