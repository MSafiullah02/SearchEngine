In critical illness, a systemic activation of coagulation may occur which, at its worst, results in a fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is characterized by simultaneous widespread microvascular thrombosis and profuse bleeding from various sites [2]. Sepsis resulting from a generalized inflammatory and procoagulant response to an infection is associated with a high risk of mortality. Twenty per cent of patients who develop severe sepsis will die during their hospitalization [3]. Septic shock is associated with the highest mortality, approaching 50 % [3]. This rate increases in the presence of circulatory shock despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy, adequate fluid resuscitation and optimal care [4], and it may reach as high as 70 % in patients with multiple organ dysfunction [5, 6].",

AT III irreversibly inhibits serine proteases (e.g. activated factor X and thrombin) in a one-to-one ratio, with the generation of protease\u2013AT III complexes. Heparin prevents AT III from interacting with the endothelial cell surface by binding to sites on the AT III molecule, competing for the AT III binding site, and reducing AT III\u2019s ability to interact with its cellular receptor. AT III\u2019s anticoagulant effect is thus greatly accelerated (by a factor of 1000) by heparin; heparin reduces AT III\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties, weakens vascular protection and increases bleeding events [7\u20139]",
