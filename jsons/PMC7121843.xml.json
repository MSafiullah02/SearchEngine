            "text": "The case study analyzed in this chapter was conducted during 2002\u20132004 at the University of Helsinki. I observed modeling practices in 22 work meetings (recorded and transcribed, duration of a meeting app. 2 h) at the National Public Health Institute (currently the Institute for Health and Welfare) and conducted 28 thematic, semi-structured interviews (transcribed for analysis) with mathematical modelers, epidemiologists, and computer scientists working as members of the interdisciplinary team (published in Mattila 2006a, b). The models were published in Auranen 1999, 2000; Auranen et al. 1996, 1999, 2000 and Auranen et al. 2004; Leino et al. 2000, 2002, 2004 and M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al. 2003. The study analyzes how an integrated simulation model on Hib transmission in the Finnish population produces explanation-based predictions. In this chapter, I will keep the focus on a single, integrated model in order to allow a detailed description of the ways in which the model predicts. The findings from the Hib case will be discussed in relation to microsimulation model on mitigating an influenzae pandemic. This example will show how microsimulations produce scenario-building predictions. The analysis focuses on detailed micro-level observations and interpretations of the predictive capacities of microsimulations. Both models are chosen, because they provide clear examples of the predictive capacities of simulations. I have chosen not to explore the vast literature on pandemic influenzae models, but to concentrate on a detailed level on a single model. The analysis is informed by a practical course \u201cIntroduction to Infectious Disease Modeling,\u201d organized by the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2006, which gave me ability to read the models and understand their core structure. As a part of the coursework, we analyzed the published pandemic simulation models and prepared a group exercise on national preparedness planning. I have chosen one of these as an example of scenario-building modeling exercise.",

Modeled encounters with public health risks are approached in terms of studying the nature of model-based predictions. These predictions form the core of our attempts to control public health concerns, prepare for sudden outbreaks, or estimate population-wide effects of bacterial or viral transmissions. Modeled encounters with risk introduce two modes of predictions, those based on explanations and those building scenarios for future events or developments. Scenario in this context means an outline of an imagined, possible situation that has been quantified through modeling. By locating modeling into the context of measurement, we will learn the different ways in which trust, credibility, and usability of the modeled predictions emerge and are communicated from research domain to decision-making processes (cf. Morgan and Morrison 1999; Boumans 1999; van den Bogaard 1999).",

Generally speaking, computer-based models (including simulation techniques) in infectious disease epidemiology share the following characteristics: First, they have a three-part elementary structure, which comprises of data element, mathematical method and computational techniques, and element of substantial knowledge, or epidemiological component. Secondly, they are \u201ctailor-made,\u201d usually addressing specified research question, which to some extent limits their applicability. Thirdly, majority of these models rely on currently available data. And it is precisely the need to reuse and reanalyze the data that partially motivate the model-building exercise. Fourthly, micro-practices that are independent the context of application, say the pathogen studied, can be identified within modeling process. A detailed analysis of the eight consecutive steps in modeling process is documented in Habbema et al.

Morgan (2002) aligns model building with similar steps to those mentioned by Habbema et al. (1996), although her focus is on economic models. The main difference is that in her account the model is first to build to represent the world, then subjected to questions and manipulation in order to receive the answers to the questions, then relating the answer to real-world phenomena.",

This step-wise characterization of the micro-practices of modeling highlight that modeling is an iterative practice, which builds upon and checks back with previous steps throughout the process. Importantly, these models are not only scientific exercises to develop better computational algorithms, they are built first and foremost to explain, understand, and predict the infectious disease outbreaks or transmission processes. The major application of this group of models (including also simulations) is to design, for example, reliable and cost-effective vaccination strategies or to predict the course of influenza pandemic (Mattila 2006a, b, c). Morgan (2001) characterizes this process as \u201cstorytelling,\u201d in which a model is a narrative device. I suggest that scenario-building predictions could be related to this aspect of model building, or \u201cstorytelling\u201d through processes of manipulation, as we will learn through pandemic modeling.",

The modeled encounters with risk, after all, are encounters to minimize the risk, to predict, and to prepare in front of the uncertain course of events. In broader terms, both types of prediction, explanation-based and scenario building, are technologies of governance that allow different interest groups to act at a distance (cf. Miller and Rose 2008). In explanation-based predictions, the underlying uncertainties are smaller, perhaps more manageable, whereas in scenario-building predictions the distance between what is known and what remains unknown is greater. Scenario-building predictions share some similarities with audit process, as discussed in Power (1997, p. 40):The audit process shrouds itself in a network of procedural routines and chains of unverified assurance, which express certain rituals of evidence gathering, but which leave the basic epistemic problem intact.\n",

One of the main threats is considered to be bacterial meningitis, because of its life-threatening nature. However, most of these infections are vaccine preventable, as in our example case, Haemophilus influenzae type b bacterial transmission. The main effort remains to reduce the risk of these severe disease forms in a population. So, the need to predict potential public health risks is answered by developing sophisticated transmission models. Evidence of potential outbreaks, indirect effects of vaccinations, and estimates of herd immunity are assessed by models. What kinds of predictions are useful to form the evidence base for vaccine-preventable infections? Amy Dahan Dalmenico (2007) argues that there is a continuous tension between the explanatory and predictive functions of models. According to her, this tension is seen as a source of conflict and compromise:Modeling practices [\u2026] should they be first and foremost predictive and operational or cognitive and explanatory. Tension between explanatory and predictive capacities, between understanding and forecasting is a source of conflict and compromise in modeling (Dahan Dalmenico 2007, p. 126).\n",

However, my analysis of the short-term, explanation-based predictions in the case of Hib transmission models, will argue that the tension could be set aside. Model-based predictions can be grounded on explanatory mechanisms, as the case of Hib transmission models, or they can provide desirable qualitative tools in a form of scenario-building prediction, as we will see. This is an interesting outcome, and useful when we are looking at how predictions help in public health risk assessment. The main benefit from models is that they allow us to \u201cdo things with numbers,\u201d to build the platform upon which one can develop understanding of the infectious risk itself and experiment with the various mitigation strategies. Through these quantifiable tools, the evidence base for risk governance is widened. In the following, I will present a detailed case study how explanation-based predictions work in the case of modeling Hib transmission.",

Hib is capable of causing severe and often life-threatening diseases, such as meningitis and pneumonia in young children (an estimated three million cases of serious illness and 400,000 deaths each year in children under 5 years of age worldwide). A part of the incentive to produce model-based predictions lies in the cost of vaccines. Hib vaccine is not yet a part of national vaccination strategies in the developing countries, mainly in Africa and Asia. Polysaccharide vaccines were on market in the 1970s and conjugates in the 1980s. The main difference is that the polysaccharides protect against the disease forms, whereas the conjugates are capable of reducing the carriage of the bacteria and hence have effect on population level circulation of the bacteria. If considered from the economic point of view, polysaccharide vaccines are older and somewhat cheaper to produce, and the conjugates are more expensive. As clarified by Hib Initiative, Hib infections are difficult to treat in the developing countries, due to the lack of access to antibiotics, which are proven to be effective when treating the severe disease forms (www.hibaction.org, accessed 25.3.2009). Because of this, the Hib Initiative presents an estimate that 20% of children in developing countries with meningitis caused by Hib will die and 15\u201320% of children suffering from it will develop lifelong disabilities. As an epidemiologist from the Helsinki modeling group argues:WHO and GAVI (the Global Alliance of Vaccinations and Inoculations) advocate Hib conjugate vaccines, the major question remains whether universal vaccination will be at all feasible in the poorest economies. Will it be cost-effective, and will it be an appropriate use of resources among other possible health interventions? Schedules optimizing the age of vaccination and the number of doses are crucial for the acceptance of the expensive vaccines (Leino 2003).\n",

To see how this question was manipulated in the model, we need to unpack the structure of the model itself. The population-simulation model, published in 2004, has a three-part structure: a demographic model (covering the age-structure of a Finnish population), a Hib-transmission model (including the contact-site structure), and an immunity model (including the immunization program and its effects). Yet, this simulation model resulted after a 10-year period of modeling work, which was dominated by integrating practices that brought together the three parts, built earlier in the project (see Mattila 2006c). So, all three parts, especially the transmission model and immunity model, were partially studied prior to the accomplishment of the population-simulation model (2004) in terms of following questions (the year after the question refers to the published model):How long does the immunity [against Hib] persist? (1999)How do we estimate the interaction between the force of infection and the duration of immunity? (2000)What is the effect of vaccinations? (2001)\n",

In the simulation model, it was used for explaining what would happen to the natural immunity, when vaccinations were introduced on a population level. This was an important aspect, since the epidemiological studies of the chosen vaccine confirmed that the vaccine itself is capable of reducing carriage. The reduction of carriage in a population could potentially lead to the waning of the natural immunity that had protective impact on a population level. In other words, herd immunity (the population level protection against an infection) could be affected (cf. Fine 1993). This indirect effect was documented in the model studying the dynamics of natural immunity. This mechanism and its numerical estimates, which were defined in terms of Hib antibody dynamics, show the descending trend in serum antibody concentration. Later, this mechanism was integrated in the population-simulation model, in particular into its immunity model part. Hence, the mechanism of natural immunity, when manipulated in the simulation model, showed that if the bacterial circulation is diminished, the natural immunity is likely to weaken and a potential increase in the risk of serious infections may affect those who are not vaccinated.",

Mitigation means all actions that aim at reducing the impact of a pandemic (Nicoll and Coulombier 2009).

In infections that are transmitted from person-to-person, the potential of the spread is called the reproductive rate that depends on the risk of transmission in a contact and also on how common the contacts are. The reproductive rate is determined by the following four factors (Giesecke 2002):The probability of transmission in a contact between an infected individual and a susceptible oneThe frequency of contacts in the populationHow long an infected person is infectiousThe proportion of the population that is already immune\n",

This rate is usually determined by empirical data, i.e., by deriving the estimate from previous epidemiological studies. However, it is a rate that carries a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of the pathogen. By this I mean that the reproductive rate is sensitive to particular strain of the pathogen in question. This sensitivity brings in a question of uncertainty in the model-based predictions. What if the strain is not so virulent? Alternatives are taken into account by modeling different possible scenarios based on different approximates of the reproductive rate. But what do the models do to the reproductive rate? In pandemic flu modeling, a future strain is unknown and therefore the models actually use data from the past strains. This relies, of course, on the assumption that the future pandemic is as virulent and contagious as the past one. If we look more closely to the reproductive rate and its variation, we can see how it manifests itself as a fingerprint of the pathogen. This idea means that population density affects the estimate since R0 tends to be higher in crowed populations.

Explanation-based predictions were also modeled on the basis of limited data, for in that case, the data were collected for other purposes (as a part of pre-Hib vaccine studies) and therefore they did not accommodate all the relevant information for model parameterization. This meant that during the modeling, some parameter estimates were acquired on the basis of comparative datasets from collaborating research groups. Along with the limits of availability of data, computational capacity may present limits to modeled encounters with risks. The modelers may not be able to access the highest-level of computing power (such as supercomputers in national computing centers), which was the case with Hib-models. These technical limitations have an effect on the way in which models are built, how fluently a model-based prediction is gained, and how reliable the instrument, (i.e., the model) itself is. Limited access to high-level computational capacity restricted the number of simulation runs for the population-simulation model that estimated Hib transmission, for example.

If the simulation model particularly addresses a question like \u201cwhat would happen if a child x in a day care unit y encounters a Hib infection?\u201d, can the prediction be applied to estimate the risk of infection among adult men in military garrison? Or if the predictive scenario of a pandemic spread examines mitigation strategies, such as school closures or travel restrictions in a particular geographical location, can the estimates be extended to cover other areas as well? These questions address the inevitable limitations of modeled encounters with public health risks, which should not be read as a recommendation not to use modeling techniques or to advocate them. After all, model-based predictions, as these two cases show, are highly beneficial as a one source of evidence for the broader base of risk assessment. The limitations are discussed in order to balance the view.",

They provide information of risks that affect the whole population, hence being interested in the \u201cwelfare of the flock as a whole,\u201d as Rose (2001) phrases Foucault\u2019s terms. The \u201cpastoral\u201d attitude that is concerned of the welfare of the whole population, Rose continues, is a form of \u201ccollectivizing power.\u201d This leads to a tension that arises when a public health risk manifests on a population level and appropriate health interventions are introduced, but at the same time, individuals consider their risk from a different angle and refuse or ignore to participate in the interventions. In other words, when an epidemic outbreak that causes a severe risk to the population (or to a part of it) happens, its further spread is prevented, for example, by vaccinations. Yet, individuals may think that the side effects from the vaccination are more severe than the infection itself and refuse to follow the public health recommendations. But what lies behind this tension? I will reassess this tension from three perspectives: as a narrative, as a case of difference between individual\u2019s risk perception and that of a group, and as a challenge that needs a broader context to address it. The concept of narratives, as I already mentioned, is helpful when applied to modeling. Morgan talks about modeling as storytelling and I will follow the most recent work by Dry and Leach (2010) to discuss how to broaden out the modeled encounters with public health risks by acknowledging the narratives told through modeling. I will address the lack of focus on individuals\u2019 risk behavior, which was highlighted in the studies by Lofgren and Fefferman (2007). I will argue that a satisfying way to contextualize modeled encounters is by regarding them as technical rationalities within the governmentality approach to risk.",

The population is seen as the \u201cultimate end of governance,\u201d as Rabinow and Rose (1994) claims. When governance seeks the form of modeling, we may use the metaphor of storytelling (Morgan 2001), which allows manipulation of the world through representing it in a model and addressing questions to it. But whose story is told and whose is ignored? Who remain silent? Dry and Leach (2010) raise this issue when they argue that narratives about infectious diseases are deeply rooted in questions of power and social justice. In order to address these questions, Dry and Leach suggest analyzing the different narratives that construct disease and epidemics. Narratives for them are not just stories, but stories with purposes and consequences. In a recent study on avian influenza surveillance, Scoones (2010) identifies three \u201coutbreak narratives\u201d: A narrative that links veterinary risk with agriculture, a human public health narrative, and a narrative focusing on pandemic preparedness. His analysis shows that a single narrative is perhaps not enough to create the evidence base in order to understand the multiplicity of an infectious risk from pandemic. We could see the benefits of model-based predictions in a similar way. At best they give us a single narrative, and perhaps our task is to look for other complementary ones for well-grounded risk assessment.",

What is left aside in these modeled encounters with risks is the ways in which individuals perceive risk and how they behave. A typical bias in individuals\u2019 response to risk is known as optimism bias, which means that individuals underestimate risks to themselves (Costa-Font et al. 2009). Joffe (2003) argues that individuals construct risks through group attachment or on the basis of their experiences in groups. She continues that response to risk is therefore \u201ca highly social, emotive and symbolic entity.\u201d Roeser\u2019s (2007) study on ethical intuitions about risks point to the same direction by acknowledging that individuals\u2019 intuitive risk judgments express ethical concerns that should be taken into account in methodologies for risk analysis or risk policy.

How social and political identities emerge from these technologies (Dean 2010, p. 217). In this chapter, modeling techniques have been regarded as a form of technical rationality or techne in the governance of risk, which Dean defines as: \u201c[\u2026] a search for analytical clarity concerning the techniques and instruments of government, the arts, skills and means by which rule is accomplished\u201d (Dean 1995, p. 560). As I have shown, model-based predictions are \u201cinstruments of government\u201d; they are tools to anticipate risks, build predictive scenarios, and test mitigation strategies. At the same time, these techniques have their limitations. They easily enforce the purely probabilistic interpretation of risk, and the evidence produced by models assesses population-level risks but cannot include estimates for individual-level or address individuals\u2019 perception of risk simultaneously. This limitation can be addressed through the analytics of risk within the context of governance.",

It seems to me that episteme and techne of risk rationality indicate a different direction or different dynamics of governing risks. Especially in the case of the pandemic, the risk considered to threaten the whole of population seemed to remain relatively small. Individuals made their own estimations for risk disregard to the recommendations or guidelines given by the public health officials. Those who were at risk did not consider the risk to be severe enough for them to follow the guidelines. As we can see, episteme and techne of risk rationality are pointing to the \u201ccare of oneself and of others,\u201d to the ethical dimension that is present when encountering public health risks.

For them, \u201cknowing an object\u201d involves \u201cprocedures of inscription,\u201d which are ways of collecting and presenting statistics, for example. It is not a process of speculative activity, but a way in which \u201cgovernmentality\u201d is made up. In my reading of governance of public health risks in the two cases, risk became a \u201cknowable object.\u201d But the actors may not have reached a point what could be called \u201caccountability of one\u2019s own actions.\u201d This is an important aspect of the ethos and its formation through rationalities of governance. Dean emphasizes that \u201cif morality is understood as the attempt to make oneself accountable for one\u2019s own actions, or as a practice in which human beings take their own conduct to be subject to self-regulation, then government is an intensely moral activity\u201d (Dean 2010, p. 19). To recognize government as \u201can intensely moral activity\u201d leads Dean to suggest that \u201ctechniques and rationalities of government needs to be complemented by a fuller clarification and elaboration around third axis, that for want of a better term, we might call \u2018axis of self-formation\u2019\u201d (Dean 1995, p. 560). So, in order to complement risk rationality and to enhance successful governance of risk, I would suggest to include all \u201cthree axes of governmentality\u201d into the process. This could lead to a balanced view which, according to Castell, seem to be threatened by modern ideologies.The modern ideologies of prevention are overarched by a grandiose technocratic rationalizing dream of absolute control of the accidental, understood as the irruption of the unpredictable. In the name of this myth of absolute eradication of risk, they construct a mass of new risks, which constitute so many new targets for preventive intervention (Castell 1991, p. 289).\n",
