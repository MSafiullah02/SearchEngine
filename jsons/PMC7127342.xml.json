Numerical examples also show that the GP is of importance. In [3], model performance of the GP is validated by 14 real-world data sets according to criteria of the mean square error (MSE) and maximum percentage error. After validating the model performance of the GP, some characteristics such as mean value function M(t) and the second moment function M2(t) are needed in most applications. Following applications of the GP can be given in order to illustrate how these functions are actually used.",

The Laplace transform of the second moment function M2Ls,a is obtained by taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the integral equation (1.3).

Therefore, it does not seem possible to obtain an integral equation for the DGP. Since the integral equations do not exist, Tang and Lam\u2019s method given in [12] or power series expansion given in [5] cannot be adapted to compute its mean value and second moment functions. In addition, the asymptotic expressions for the mean value and second moment functions of the DGP cannot be obtained by using the similar argument of this study since we use the Laplace transform of the integral equations (1.1), (1.3). To the best of our knowledge, the only computational procedure for the mean value and second moment functions of the DGP is to obtain Monte Carlo estimation of these functions depending on the convolutions of the distribution functions proposed by [13].",
