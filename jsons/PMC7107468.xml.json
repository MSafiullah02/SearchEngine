Before experiments, flies were deprived of water and feed overnight, and kept chilled in the dark. Before feeding with the AIV suspensions, the flies were anesthetized with CO2 and placed individually in disposable sterile 1,000-\u03bcl pipette tips cut to size for the fly's head and lapping proboscis to protrude. From this position, each fly dined on 1-\u03bcl volume of sterile or virus-positive AF diluted in PBS supplied by micropipette. Flies were fed two-fold diluted virus solutions (20, 2\u22122, or 2\u22124); hence, each fly was fed H5N7 virus doses equivalent to 104.9 ELD50, 104.3 ELD50, or 103.7 ELD50, or H7N1 virus in doses of 105.5 ELD50, 104.9 ELD50, or 104.3 ELD50. Flies that stopped or declined eating the full volume of virus solution were discarded. Fed flies were transferred to closed cages in groups of five for each combination of virus dilution, temperature, and incubation period. Fed flies were stored at room temperature until all 60 flies included in each experimental group were fed, after which the cages were placed in incubators and the incubation period of 6, 12, or 24 h was started. Importantly, the order with which flies were fed with the different virus dilutions was consistent among all experiments. Flies had unlimited access to whole-fat, pasteurized and homogenized milk during incubation. Sham-fed flies dined on equal volumes of sterile AF and were incubated as described above. Also, 0-h experiments were included, in which groups of five flies were fed 1-\u03bcl volume of either sterile AF or the three virus solutions for each virus strain. These flies were subsequently kept at room temperature (24\u00b0C) for 10 min without access to milk before termination. Likewise, for each experimental round another five flies were tested for virus as described below without any feeding or incubation.",

Subsequently, body fluids, crop and intestinal organs from the abdomen were immediately harvested aseptically as described below. Alternatively, flies were kept at \u221280\u00b0C up to 48 h before harvest. While holding the fly with a sterile forceps in a sterile petri dish, the area surrounding the fly's cloaca was sterilized with a heated scalpel and punctured by a sterile needle. The content of the abdomen was harvested by a micropipette with a sterile disposable tip. The contents from each group of five flies were pooled in 0.5 ml of medium [PBS (8 mM) with penicillin (8,100 U/ml), streptomycin (8,100 \u03bcg/ml), gentamicin sulphate (200 \u03bcg/ml), nystatin (8,100 U/ml), fetal bovine serum (4.5% vol:vol), and phenol red 2\u2030 (0.4% vol:vol)]. To detect the presence of infectious virus, undiluted 200-\u03bcl aliquots of each pooled sample supernatant were inoculated into two SPF ECEs within 12 h of preparation by following a modified version of the EU Directive 2005/94/EC (http://vla.defra.gov.uk/science/sci_ai_reflab_man.htm). Samples were homogenized before inoculation. The individual groups of flies were scored as virus-positive if any of the SPF ECEs were infected (dead embryo and hemagglutinin-positive allantoic fluid) by primary inoculation or after one blind passage. Similarity between inoculated and isolated virus was confirmed by sequencing of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplicons.

As expected, the pools of five flies selected randomly as negative controls before each experimental setup were all negative for virus, confirming the flies be bred under virus-free conditions. Similarly, all groups of flies fed with sterile allantoic fluid were negative for virus (Table 1).

Correspondence between fed virus subtype and harvested samples from the flies was tested on randomly selected samples by RT-PCR and sequencing of the amplicons; identical similarity was confirmed in all cases.

Likewise, a sensitivity analysis confirmed that the inclusion of the 0 h experimental data did not alter model 3. Statistical analyses confirmed that the persistence of infective virus from virus-fed fly pools decreased as a function of virus concentration, incubation period postfeeding, and temperature (Table 2). The coefficients for T and I cannot be regarded on their own, because of the significant T:I interaction effect (Table 2). Thus, for a temperature of 15\u00b0C, the effect of incubation period is given by the slope \u03b2I + 15\u03b2T:I, which Table 2 estimates as 0.206 \u221215\u00b70.0165 = \u22120.0415. Obviously, the slope is lower for higher temperatures. Similarly, the effect of temperature at an incubation period of 6 h is \u03b2T + 6\u03b2T:I, which is estimated as 0.0328 \u2212 6\u00b70.0165 = \u22120.0662. In the same way, the coefficients for S and C must be combined with the corresponding interaction coefficient, to represent the effects of strain and virus concentration, respectively. As examples, the estimated persistence of virus-positive fly pools for each employed AIV subtype fed with a virus concentration of 107.3 ELD50/ml are shown in Fig. 1. The estimated incubation periods at which 50% of fly pools fed with either of the virus concentrations would be virus-positive are illustrated in Fig. 2.",

Although it cannot be excluded that the primary, secondary, and tertiary structural differences in the projecting surface molecules on the two LPAIV strains used may be correlated with different inactivation kinetics and excretion rate, this contribution was assumed to be questionable. The observed differences may reflect strain-related adaption of the two virus strains to cultivation in ECEs, strain-related pathogenicity and virus doses. The difference in persistence is especially prominent for the most diluted virus solutions. For example, one of the 0-h experiments with the most diluted virus solution of H5N7 was virus-negative, although the flies were fed only 10 min before termination. However, the reason for this strain difference is at present unknown, and further experiments including a variety of different LPAIV and HPAIV strains are required to address this issue.",

Although this procedure was time-consuming and caused some time delay before incubation, it was considered essential to ensure that all virus-exposed flies had ingested the required volume of virus. The house fly frequently regurgitates and defecates during foraging (Greenberg 1973), so the ingested doses of virus cannot be controlled by using ad libitum access to infective allantoic fluid. The focus of the current study was on the persistence of AIV in the alimentary tract; therefore, virus particles present on the fly's exoskeleton had to be excluded in the recovery procedures for infectious virus in the experiments. To obtain this, a method was developed for aseptic harvest of the content of the fly's posterior abdomen that involved thermal inactivation of external virus particles. The house fly's irregular integument surface may complicate external disinfection by solutions, a potential obstacle which we solved by thermal inactivation. This approach also made it possible to subsequently process the harvested pooled fly samples in small volumes convenient for virus isolation. However, it cannot be excluded that the method may have led to some thermal inactivation of infective virions located within the alimentary canal.",

Also, LPAIV of H5 and H7 subtypes have the potential to mutate to HPAIV in poultry, causing devastating outbreaks of disease. Because of their high morbidity and mortality, HPAIV do not circulate between wild birds and domestic poultry as does the LP variants. Furthermore, LPAIVs were used in our study for safety reasons because it was not feasible to contain house flies exposed to HPAIV in the laboratory. LPAIV may not represent a complete model for persistence of HPAIV in house flies. HPAIV H5N1 was recently shown to persist in the viscera of house flies up to 72-h postexposure in the laboratory (Wanaratana et al. 2011), whereas only one of the 36 virus-fed fly pools incubated at 25 or 35\u00b0C for 24 h was positive for virus in our study. Similarly, a velogenic exotic NDV strain was demonstrated to persist in house flies for a longer period of time than the less virulent mesogenic NDV (Roakin) strain (Watson et al. 2007, Chakrabarti et al. 2008). However, differences in the sensitivity of laboratory detection of viruses related to their pathogenicity may influence these results.",

            "text": "The synanthropic and omnivorous house fly is a very common and abundant livestock farm pest, which is attracted by moist manure and other fermenting organic waste that serves as a food source as well as developing environment of the fly (Axtell 1999, Malik et al. 2007, Hald et al. 2008). Because chickens capture and eat flying insects (Hald et al. 1998, Hald et al. 2008), flies foraging on virus-containing feces represent a risk in the spread of disease. Chickens infected with AIV shed virus in secretions and excretions, and although HPAIV typically are found in both feces and respiratory secretions, the primary route of shedding of LPAIV depends on the virus strain (Spickler et al. 2008). Viral quantities of 103.2\u2013107.9 and 105.5\u2013108.1 EID50/ml have been reported in cloacal and fecal samples, respectively, from chickens infected in the laboratory with LPAIV H1, H4, and H6 subtypes (Morales et al. 2009). Shed titers up to 104.5 and 104.3 EID50/ml have been observed in cloacal swabs from chickens infected with LPAIV H5N1 and H7N2 subtypes, respectively (Swayne and Beck 2005, Spackman et al. 2007). In our experiments, high virus doses were used to be able to monitor the persistence over time. Each fly ingested a minimum dose of 103.7 ELD50 (H5N7) and the pool of five flies a minimum total of 104.4 ELD50, which was sufficient to infect ECEs. Under natural conditions, the dose of virus that a house fly may ingest when foraging on virus-containing feces will depend on the amount and persistence of shed virus, the fly's hunger state as well as the size of the fly. Large flies are expected to uptake more food when foraging than smaller individuals and thus ingest more virus. A female house fly can ingest a volume to 2\u20134 \u03bcl (Kobayashi et al. 1999), and the frequency of foraging depends on factors such as temperature, level of stress and the food source. Although an individual fly might not ingest a sufficient virus dose to infect a chicken, the uptake of several infected flies may be critical and lead to infection. In this respect, Calibeo-Hayes et al. (2003) demonstrated that under controlled conditions the number of turkeys infected with TCV increased when placed in contact with higher numbers of TCV-exposed flies per bird.",
