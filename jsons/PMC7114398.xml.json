            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus, and is a member of the family Arteriviridae, together with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae are classified as members of the order Nidovirales, mainly based on their similar replication and transcription strategy (den Boon et al., 1991, Gorbalenya et al., 2006, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). Two genotypes of PRRSV have been classified, (European) type 1 and (North American) type 2, Lelystad virus (LV) (Wensvoort et al., 1992) and VR2332 (Benfield et al., 1992) are the representative strains of two types, respectively. PRRSV virion consists of at least seven structural proteins, including glycoprotein 2 (GP2) (Meulenberg and Petersen-den Besten, 1996), GP3 (de Lima et al., 2009), GP4 (van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996), GP5, and unglycosylated envelope (E) protein (Wu et al., 2005), membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Bautista et al., 1996). Structural proteins of arteriviruses are expressed via a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) formed by a unique discontinuous transcription process (de Vries et al., 1990, Meng et al., 1996, Nelsen et al., 1999). The common 5\u2032 leader sequence of sgmRNAs is derived from the 5\u2032 proximal un-translated region (UTR). The leader-body junction sequence can be amplified by sgmRNA-specific RT-PCR (Chen et al., 1993, den Boon et al., 1996, Meulenberg et al., 1993, Nelsen et al., 1999, Zheng et al., 2010).",

Generally, type 1 and type 2 PRRSV N proteins consist of 128 and 123 amino acids (aa), respectively. However, Stadejek et al. (2008) reported that N protein of type 1 exhibits size polymorphism, the number of amino acid residues varies from 124 to 130. Although N protein is one of the inter-genotypically conserved proteins, LV and VR2332 share only 64% identity at the amino acid level (Dea et al., 2000). N protein is assembled into an icosahedral nucleocapsid in the form of disulfide-linked homodimer (Wootton and Yoo, 2003), and the C-terminal half of PRRSV N protein is believed to be the dimerization domain (Spilman et al., 2009). The N-terminal half of N protein is enriched in basic amino acids and intrinsically disordered, which are common properties of RNA-binding proteins (Daginakatte and Kapil, 2001, Doan and Dokland, 2003, Yoo et al., 2003).",

The structure is homologous to that of EAV (Deshpande et al., 2007), and surprisingly, has a fold similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (Yu et al., 2006). By replacing each amino acid with proline, Wootton et al. (2001) demonstrated that the 111\u2013117 aa substitution of type 2 PRRSV N protein reduces the conformational-dependent monoclonal antibody (McAb) binding significantly. Therefore, the C-terminus of N protein is important for maintaining the local and/or the overall configuration of the PRRSV N protein. Verheije et al. (2001) reported that C-terminal six amino acids of N protein are non-essential for virus infectivity of type 1 PRRSV. These authors also indicated that the N-terminal and internal regions of N protein cannot tolerate deletion.",

In this study, to further illustrate the roles of the terminal and internal aa residues of N protein in type 2 PRRSV replication, particularly in viral viability. We performed serial deletions at the N- and C-termininal of N protein in the context of full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS.

As shown in Fig. 3A, all but pN\u039416/5\u201320 displayed nsp2 and N protein expression, but the fluorescence intensity was different. It was noteworthy that there were only several single cells stained for mutant pN\u039410/5\u201314, suggesting virus spreading between neighboring cells was affected. Moreover, no fluorescent signal was detected in the case of pN\u039416/5\u201320 (even after prolonged incubation at 7 dpt; data not shown), indicating that deletion of residues 5\u201320 (5NGKQQKKKKGDGQPV20N) might have blocked both virus replication and transcription.

Eighteen plaques were selected and sequence analysis showed five different second-site mutations, including G40R&K44E (ppv5 in Fig. 7\n), and four different substitutions together with 48/52K/K repaired, as summarized in Fig. 7. We further determined the master sequence of the full-length genome sequence of ppv3, no detectable genetic alteration was found in the other region of the viral genome besides N gene. It is also worth noting that the five aa (PGPVM) insertion between residues 21 and 22 of the N protein in virus N\u039448\u201352 ppv20 resulted in an unusual length of N protein (125 aa).

In this study, the mutant pN\u039416/5\u201320 deleted part of this corresponding structure, including the putative 7-nt kissing-loop sequence in APRRS ORF7 (Fig. 1B).

We determined the nucleotide sequences of 5\u2032UTR, 3\u2032UTR and M region of all mutant viruses, however, no obvious genetic alterations were observed in these regions. Therefore, the N protein domains that may be responsible for protein\u2013RNA and protein\u2013protein interactions are most likely located outside of the mutated region.

We cannot completely rule out the possibility that quasispecies nature may account for some of the additional mutations, as we essentially determined the consensus sequences of the mutant viruses by direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products. Another reason for the lack of mutation is that the parental virus, APRRS, is highly adapted on MARC-145 cells, which could limit the number of the quasispecies. More importantly, these spontaneous mutations are often in the forms of deletions and insertions, which could not be simply attributed to the quasispecies nature.

For example, point mutation and out-of-frame insertion were found in the recovered virus C\u03944/120\u2013123 in two experiments (Fig. 5B). Also the same spontaneous mutation might respond to different primary deletions, such as S120P that arose simultaneously in the recovered viruses N\u03948/5\u201312 and N\u03949/5\u201313. On the other hand, most of the spontaneous mutations were located at the N-terminal domain of N protein, the structure of which is still unresolved. Therefore, it was difficult to illustrate any spatial relationship between the primary deletion and spontaneous mutations described in our study. In addition, we did not find a clear pattern of local charge compensation for the spontaneous mutations. Another explanation of the spontaneous mutations would be the role of the underlying RNA secondary structure. We also analyzed the local secondary structure of all mutants, but no significantly change was found. Except for pN\u039416/5\u201320, none of the other mutants and the recovered viruses affects the potential kissing loop structure of N protein.

Expression of nsp2 and N was visualized by immunofluorescence staining at 48 and 72 hpt, respectively. (B) Schematic drawing of PRRSV genome and sgmRNA7, sgmRNA 7.1 and sgmRNA7.2 represents the two sgmRNAs of type 2 PRRSV N protein. SF12 and SR15284 indicate the positions of RT-PCR primer pairs. (C) Identification of leader-body junction sequence of N-terminal deletion mutants by sgmRNA7-specific RT-PCR. The two bands in pAPRRS, pN\u03949/5\u201313, and pN\u039410/5\u201314 represent the identified sgmRNA 7.1 and sgmRNA 7.2. (D) Multiple growth curves on MARC-145 cells. Cells were infected with P5 wild-type APRRS, and recovered P5 N-terminal deletion mutant viruses at \u223c0.01 MOI. Infectious virus released into the supernatants was collected and monitored at different times post-infection.",
