            "text": "In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, now officially named as the COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, emerged in Wuhan, China [1,2]. From bronchoalveolar lavage samples of the infected patients, a novel beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated and identified as the causative agent [3]. Current studies have demonstrated that the COVID-19 shares over 88% homology with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZC21, and that bats may be the most likely natural host [4]. However, whether the SARS-CoV-2 transmits directly from bats or through an intermediate host is still uncertain. Although epidemiological studies indicate a common link between the initially diagnosed patients and the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan [5], an increasing number of later confirmed cases have involved infected patients without a history of contacting the implicated market, nor traveling to Wuhan [6], and the family cluster type of infections were reported [7,8]. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed [6], and respiratory droplets and contact are the main transmission routes, while recent reports also suggested the existence of the fecal-oral transmission route [6,9].",

Reported illnesses have ranged from patients with little or no symptoms to patients being severely ill and dying [6]. The main clinical manifestations include fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea [5,10,11]. As compared to young and middle-aged patients with COVID-19, elder infected patients with chronic comorbidities have an increased risk of developing organ dysfunctions, including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury, resulting in a higher mortality rate [10,11]. However, the clinical features between severely affected and not severely affected cases have not yet been well described. Unlike SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 displays a highly contagious infectiousness even during the asymptomatic period [12].",

For critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were monitored on the day of ICU admission. Two researchers independently reviewed data to double check the accuracy of collected data. For the data that were not available for records, the researchers directly communicated with patients and doctors to ascertain data integrity. Nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 were repeated twice and shown virus clearance before discharge of patients\u2019.

Our data show that lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 80% of severely affected patients, consistent with the result of a recent cohort study [17]. Lymphocytopenia is also a prominent feature of severely affected patients with SARS-CoV and MERS infection, which attribute to the necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocyte caused by invasive viral particles [18,19]. We also analyzed the absolute number of different subsets of lymphocytes in ICU patients. Compared to the health population, the total number of T cells (312 [231\u2013558] vs [805\u20134459]; number per \u03bcl), CD4+ T cells (245 [148\u2013297] vs [345\u20132350]), CD8+ T cells (81 [64\u2013230] vs [345\u20132350]), total B cells (81 [47\u2013106] vs [240\u20131317]) as well as natural killer cells (51 [21\u2013115] vs [210\u20131514]) were dramatically decreased in severely affected patients (data not shown), suggesting that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of COVID-19. A recent study showed a significantly reduced total number of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in older and severely affected patients with COVID-19 [20], and revealed one possible mechanism by which the aberrant cytokine signaling including TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10 may be mediated in T cell pro-apoptosis [20]. In addition, abnormal laboratory findings in severely affected patients also included prolonged thrombin time, increased AST/AST, hypersensitive troponin I, and serum creatine, suggesting aberrant coagulation pathway, hepatic injury, myocardial injury, and kidney injury, respectively. The levels of PCT, a marker suggesting bacterial infection, were not elevated in patients with COVID-19, suggesting viral-mediated pneumonia rather than bacteria. These laboratory abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection [[21], [22], [23]].",

The coinfection rate was also higher in the death group than that of the ICU-to-Ward transfer group, despite no significantly statistical difference due to a small number of cases being involved. The main reasons for the increased hospital-acquired infections were due to lymphocytopenia and the reduced host immune functions in critically ill patients. These patients who have invasive catheters including endotracheal tube, arteriovenous catheters, urinary, and gastric tubes, result in increased susceptibility to secondary infections of nosocomial multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus. We found that 5 (55.6%) of COVID-19 patients coinfected with carbapenem-resistant A. baumanni (CRAB) in the ICU death group, which was much higher than those (4 [17.4%]) in the ICU-to-Ward transfer group (data not shown). The higher rate of CRAB infection poses difficulties in antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased possibility to develop septic shock and death [24].",

The principles of treatment include improvement of the symptoms and underlying diseases, active prevention of potential complications, and secondary infections. Like other viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis [25]. Studies showed that the SARS-CoV-2 may infect alveolar epithelial cells in the lung through the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor, which is also expressed in other tissues, such as kidney, blood vessels, and heart [25,26]. Researchers using an artificial intelligence predicted that Baricitinib, an inhibitor of AP2-associated protein kinase 1, might be useful to interrupt the entrance of virus to cells as well as the intracellular assembly of virus particles [4,27]. In addition, a case report showed that remdesivir, an adenosine analogue, has shown survival benefits in one severely affected patient with COVID-19 pneumonia [28]. The effectiveness has been verified in vitro [29]. Now a couple of clinical trials focus on the efficacy of remdesivir, as well as other therapeutic strategies, such as immunoglobulins, Vitamin C infusion, mesenchymal stem cell treatment, arbidol hydrochloride plus interferon atomization, ritonavir combined with oseltamivir, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol hydroxychloroquine and methylprednisolone [30].",

Corticosteroid therapy was used to treat patients with refractory high fever, exacerbation of wheezing symptoms, increased interstitial exudation based on chest radiology, and high levels of inflammatory mediators to inhibit the \"cytokine storm\". Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 1\u20132 mg/kg/day) is recommended for severely ill patients with ARDS, for as short a duration of treatment as possible [32,33]. The results showed that the early onset use of corticosteroid may have clinical benefits, but more cases and multivariate correlation analysis regarding the safety and efficacy were needed to be verified. Our data also suggested that excessive fluid resuscitation may increase the risk of death. One principle of the ARDS treatments is the restricted fluid resuscitation strategy to prevent the exacerbation of pulmonary edema [34].",
