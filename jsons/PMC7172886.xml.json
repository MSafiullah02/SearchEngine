The error-prone replication by HIV reverse transcriptase is generally held responsible for the impressive fraction of defective viruses observed in productively infected lymphocytes. A variety of other mechanisms can contribute to generate modifications in the HIV genomes by restabilizing the viral information under new forms, among them recombination phenomena now thought to be mainly responsible for HIV genomic flexibility throughout an infection process [1], [2], [3], [4]. This raised the notion of \u2018mosaic viruses\u2019 composed of parts inherited from divergent entire or partial viral genomes that could be present in the cells when the replication steps occur [5], [6], [7].",

The sequence conservation can be considered as the maintenance of either the general function of a protein or a potential precise function associated with a nucleotide segment (e.g., restriction or binding site). The extended nucleotide variability allowed by natural selection could lead to the evolution or to the disappearance of a function. In view of this analysis, the short conserved sequences may play crucial roles both in viral ontology and viral divergence independently of gene products functions (e.g., regulatory or enzymatic processes) as some of these sequences overlap genes. They could correspond to recombinogenic sequences important to understand lentiviral genomic flexibility.",

A Recombinant Identification Program was applied to the HIV-1 gag and env coding regions and allowed to determine putative large recombination segments \u2013 thus delimiting \u2018recombination cassettes\u2019 \u2013 and to create phylogenetic trees [12]. However, theses trees highly differed when the currently used computation methods were applied to either the gag, pol, or env genes, and when reference genome in the same population was changed [6], [7], [12], [13], [14]. The situation was made more complex when fragment analysis of a single gene showed divergent phylogenetic trees for each studied fragment [5], [6], [7], [14], [15], [16], this being due to the independent evolution of each gene. In lentiviral genomes, the programs have rarely revealed precise recombinogenic segments, but rather computerized plots or large domains possibly implied in the recombination process [10], [11], [17].",

In our global approach concerning complete genomes in all situations, we carried out the detection of Conserved Lentiviral Sequences (CLSs), their precise location being harmonized thanks to the use of a single MMy 1\u00ae sequence starting reference (see Section 2). The analysis was made on genomes belonging to mammal lentiviruses, negative control viruses and random-generated genome-like sequences. This scan of the DNA lentiviral sequences for conserved stretches allowed to identify 28 CLSs mainly situated in gag, pol and, in a minor proportion, env structural genes. A few of them were also noticed in the LTRs and the regulatory genes. A large part (82%) of CLSs located in HIV-1s is situated in currently described recombination segments where they might form recombinogenic hot spots [6], [7], [13], [14], [15], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. The similar position of each sequence in the different viral families led to establish the notion of \u2018lentiviral\u2019 and \u2018retroviral self\u2019 that was defined by the specificity of the sequences for restricted viral families.",

To test CLS specificity, three kinds of negative controls were examined. First, non lentiviral yet retroviral genomes were screened (5 spumaviruses, 25 oncornaviruses and 4 D-particle-forming simian viruses). Then, a set of human, animal and vegetal viruses was tested: 4 herpes viruses, 47 human and animal viruses (1 adenovirus, 6 coronaviruses, 2 filoviruses, 12 flaviviruses, 13 parvoviruses, 10 picornaviruses and 3 rhabdoviruses) and 18 vegetal viruses (5 geminiviruses, 2 potyviruses, 5 tobamoviruses, 1 tombusvirus, 3 tymoviruses and 2 necroviruses). Finally, 50 10-kilobase-DNA-like structures were randomly generated with a computer in order to eliminate any bias due to the possible subsequent biological role.",

We first established the length of sub-sequences with the following trial/error method selecting parts of genomes. When the length was inferior to 10 nucleotides, numerous sub-sequences were found in every genome, including the control ones. When it was superior to 50 nucleotides, very few sub-sequences were found. The correct length was determined when it corresponded to that of sub-sequences common to most of the immunodeficiency viral genomes in either all or certain viral families. A similar approach was used for the determination of the number of accepted transitions. The relationship between both parameters led to an optimized choice of a 15-nucleotide-long sequence with a maximum of three admitted transitions. All the sequences showing such a determined length were tested and positioned in genomes thanks to the Expasy program available on Internet. Some of them overlapped and created longer conserved domains. Sequences present in most lentiviral genomes and checked not to be found in negative controls were selected. The number of accepted transitions was retained according to their lentiviral specificity to allow a variability of 15 to 20%. In some cases the limit of 25% was retained, which is thought to delimit the generally admitted jump from one family to another and might fit with a possible biological significance.",

Thus, as the first considered nucleotides at the 5\u2032 extremity vary from one genome to another, the rough detection of the sub-sequences gave heterogeneous localizations. Another approach could use the real starting ATG (as given in the databases) of the coding sequences as the initial nucleotide, but this was too complex because of the frequent presence of several other ATGs. To sharpen and to harmonize the location of CLSs, we calculated their relative positions as compared to that of one of them chosen as the reference sequence (position +1). This sequence \u2013 MMy 1\u00ae \u2013 was previously described for PCR purpose [38], [39] and corresponds to the beginning of the PBS (reverse transcription primer binding site) at the 5\u2032 extremity of the genomes. It is situated, for example, between nucleotides 182 and 199 on the HIV-1 BRU/LAI genome reported in Genbank. MMy 1\u00ae was found in HIV-1, HIV-2, AGM, macaque, CPZ, sooty mangabey, mandrill, equine and feline lentiviruses. When two LTRs were present in the genomic banks (HIV-1, HIV-2 and equine viruses), a second MMy 1\u00ae sequence detected at the 3\u2032 extremity of the genomes was not considered in the analysis. In the Sykes' monkey, bovine, caprine, ovine and ovine/caprine viruses lacking MMy 1\u00ae, the indicated numbers corresponding to CLS locations were determined as crude positions directly detected on the genomes.",

Particularly, the sequence detection evidenced the p17 and p24 proteins for gag gene and the p31 and p51 proteins for pol gene, while CLS 11 and 13 were found in the gp120 protein of env gene (see Table 2, Table 3). Moreover, it was noticeable that CLS 7 was at the hinge of the two LTRs. In HIV-2 genome, CLSs were also mainly related to gag, pol and env genes. HIV-2 and SIV genomes presented similar organizations, but some differences led us to differentiate the SIVs in several categories (Fig. 2, Fig. 3; Supplementary data). For example, CPZ viruses exhibited a striking analogy with HIV-1s, while AGM, macaque and sooty mangabey genomes showed a CLS organization rather similar to that found in HIV-2s, confirming molecular data. CPZ viruses also presented such a similarity with HIV-1s at the molecular level, yet they belonged to the simian viruses concerning the immunological characterization (e.g., [1], [8], [43]). Besides, the Sykes' monkey virus appeared to be particular since it presented only six CLSs, four of them being at the hinge of the pol/vif genes. The D-particle-forming viruses showed the simplest organization with only CLS 3 and 4 that framed the beginning of pol gene. For the non-primate mammal viruses, the data must be cautiously interpreted, because the low number of studied genomes was not representative for some of these families. However, it is noteworthy that their detected sequences were mainly situated in the gag-pol region. The CLSs of these viruses whose number increased from bovine, equine, ovine/caprine, ovine, feline and finally up to caprine genomes showed a similar pattern (Fig. 3; Supplementary data).",

About one third of CLSs were common to almost all primate lentiviral genomes. As to CLSs specific to HIVs, their detection fitted with the known immunological families. Maps of the viruses that can be reconstructed from building blocks delimited by CLSs were specific to each viral type, though they presented a similar high density in the gag-pol region. The revealed homology in gene location of CLSs between HIVs and simian viruses confirmed the separation into two categories (HIV-1/CPZ viruses, HIV-2s/other SIVs). A clear barrier between primate and other mammal viruses appeared, due to shifting locations for some CLSs in the non-primate ones.",

The correlation between wide recombination segments (whose list is not exhaustive) and CLSs acutely localized in the same regions is shown in Table 4\n. Most of CLSs located in HIV-1s (82%) corresponded to such reported sequences, an underestimated value since multiple recombinogenic segments lacking of precise location (e.g., [35], [36]) are not mentioned. CLS 2 and 4 as well as MMy 28 were situated in the HIV-1 recombination sequence shown in the gag-pol region [21]. Other domains contained CLS 2 and CLS 7 in the nef-LTR region [19], MMy 1 (LTR), MMy 3 (gag gene) and MMy 31, as well as CLS 9 (pol gene) in a study using HIV-1 strains deleted in the env gene [22]. In complete HIV-1 genomes, recombinogenic segments have been reported in the pol gene at RT level (p51 protein), to which corresponded CLS 8, 9, 10 and 12, and in the env/nef common part, containing CLS 2 [20]. They concerned also the gag (p17 protein), env (gp 41 and 120 proteins) and nef genes that carried MMy 3 as well as CLS 10 and 14, CLS 11 and 13, and CLS 2 and 7, respectively [6]. Recombinogenic segments corresponded to CLSs 11 and 13 in env gene (gp120 protein) and CLS 14 in the tat/rev overlapping region [34]. Among the 22 CLSs present in HIV-1s, 82% belonged to the large recombination domains cited above. MMy 4\u2032 and CLS 5 that corresponded to gag p24 protein (core protein) and CLSs 6 and 15 that corresponded to pol p31 protein (integrase) have not been correlated until now to recombinogenic segments.",

It allowed us to postulate that if one recombination induced the formation of one variant, the association of series of related variants formed one subtype. The latter was produced by recombinations between distinct variants that could cause or not the emergence of a new subtype. The genomic flexibility is associated with the viral-derived DNA sequences that can recombine [1], [19], [30] and/or produce complementing and/or recombining RNAs [4], [44], [45]. Once several elements of the viral genome have penetrated into a cell \u2013 and sometimes together with HIV DNA pieces carried by virions [46] \u2013 they may be rearranged to possibly elicit productive infection in a new target tissue. For example, CLS 11 and CLS 13 (HIV-1 env gene) were located at the level of the V3 and V4 variable loops of the gp120 cell-binding protein, respectively corresponding to the recombinogenic segments previously described [6], [20], [26], [27], [33], [34]. This CLS 11/CLS 13 tandem seems to correspond to an important building block for the creation of a new cellular tropism. The V3 domain is critical for chemokine-mediated blockade of infection [47] and the V3 and V4 regions that are separated by the C3 constant domain represent the targets of many trials for the establishment of a candidate vaccine.",

It is worth mentioning that CLSs 16 and 2 have a very close function. CLS 16 was a part of the cPPT involved in the initiation of lentivirus reverse transcription [53] where DNA synthesis enhances DNA/DNA recombination [54]. CLS 2 represented the well-conserved part of the distal PPT, and perhaps the action site, while the neighbouring sequences which varied highly from a virus to another one might constitute a specific recognition site for the reverse transcriptase associated with a given virus. HIV-1s displayed two CLS 2 at positions shown to be the cPPT (pol gene) [44] and the distal PPT (nef gene) [53]. Also, HIV-2s revealed a slightly different organization, since CLS 16 was part of the cPPT (pol gene) and CLS 2 part of the distal PPT when the nef gene overlaps the 3\u2032 LTR. The role in recombination of CLSs situated in the conserved PPT was emphasized by the determination in the pol gene (protein p31, integrase) of a recombinogenic segment that could affect the viral productive cycle [14].",

CLS 15 presented the noticeable triplicate AATT structure (AAACTAAAGAATTACAAAAACAAATTACAAAAATT) neighbouring CLS 6 to form a termination structure. In view of the structure of the CTS (pol gene, p31 protein) [56], CLS 15 together with CLS 6 showed the AAAAATT and AAATTTT motives corresponding respectively to 1 and 2, strong and weak, stop signals [57], [58].

CLSs specificity revealed that two kinds of recombinations seemed to coexist. One involved sequences mostly common to all the lentiviral genomes separated by large domains, which could allow interspecific recombinations. The other type of recombination involved sequences that within a same family were separated by short distances or even overlapped as shown in HIV-1s for CLS 10 and 14 (gag gene). These findings led us to discriminate between restricted or expanded specificity. In a gene-to-gene study on gag and env genes, wide segments have been described where recombinations could be present, which implied that one recombinant virus characterizes one subtype [12]. The multiplicity of viral subspecies present in the same infected host may be a cause and/or a consequence of the recombination phenomena [1], [3], [4], [30], the generation of recombining strains increasing this process.",

Such a process involves two adjacent or distant CLSs that can be situated in the same gene or in two different genes. Considering all the possibilities of recombination that happen during an infection, the viability of the newly recombinant genome is the single criterion of selection. The cascade of slow genomic divergences is an integral part of the viral ontogeny to ensure long-term survival. Such genetic approaches could benefit from the defined CLSs, whose characteristic is to be well-conserved and to keep functional the viral genome. Thus the mechanism that maintains the genomic flexibility would be an excellent tool to impede viral growth, particularly when sequences implied in recombination and genetic expression are modified or blocked. As an ad absurdum argument, D-particle-forming viruses that do not cause immunodeficiency presented a single sequence CLS 3 (pol gene), and occasionally CLS 4 (gag gene), a situation leading to the suppression of some necessary specificity steps. These two CLSs were the only sequences detected in HTLV-1s showing a genetic stability like that in HTLV-2s yet without CLS, which suggests that they could play a role in gene exchange between oncorna- and/or retroviruses.",

The high degree of divergence is a vital part of the viral ontogeny, and recombinations induce sustained viral multiplication allowing the environment to select the most efficient genomic alternative. This emphasizes the importance of the number, the position and the specificity of CLSs on the viral genome, especially since most of them fitted with recombinogenic segments already described. The biological role validity of some CLSs not associated until now with a known function had to be checked in vitro, for example by reverse genetic experiments that could reveal the importance of the different sequences.
