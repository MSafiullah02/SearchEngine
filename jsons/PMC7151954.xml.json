PIV 2 may account for many sporadic cases, and PIV 3 is a less common cause of viral LTB, usually targeting the epithelium of the smaller airways and leading to bronchiolitic illness. The PIVs belong to the Paramyxoviridae family, along with respiratory syncytial virus, measles, mumps, and the recently identified human metapneumovirus.6 Together the PIVs account for more than 75% of viral LTB cases, although other respiratory viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and enteroviruses) can produce a similar clinical syndrome. Herpesviruses tend to cause a more severe and protracted form of the disease. LTB can also occur with some systemic infections, such as measles, and less commonly, Mycoplasma. In general, however, it is not usually possible to identify the cause of infection from the child's symptoms because severity does not correlate with any particular etiologic agent.",

Affected children are usually of preschool age, with a peak incidence between 18 and 24 months of age.7 Reported incidence rates vary from 1.5% to 6%, but less than 5% of these require hospital admission, and only 1% to 2% of those admitted require endotracheal intubation and intensive care.8 This proportion has fallen dramatically since the use of corticosteroids has become routine. There is a male preponderance in children younger than 6 years of age (1.4:1), although both sexes appear to be affected equally at an older age. Cases may occur in epidemics, with those caused by PIV 1 particularly presenting in fall and winter months and infection with other organisms (including PIV 2) occurring more commonly as isolated infections. Infection is via droplet spread or direct inoculation from the hands. Viruses can survive for long periods on dry surfaces, such as clothes and toys, emphasizing the importance of infection-control practices.",

            "text": "Infection affects the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, although swelling and inflammation in the subglottic area leads to the characteristic clinical features of viral LTB. In addition to relative differences in airway size (discussed earlier in the chapter), it is suggested that poor cell-mediated immunity in younger age groups also accounts for differences observed between adults and children.9 The epithelium of the subglottis possesses abundant mucous glands, secretions from which can further narrow the airway lumen in response to infection. The PIVs are trophic for the respiratory epithelium, binding in particular to ciliated cells via an interaction between the viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein and its receptor, sialic acid. Other viral proteins (the F protein in particular) are important in membrane fusion and the passage of viral particles between cells. Many strains of PIV are cytopathic, with infection leading to the formation of giant cells and cell death. As with many infective processes, the ensuing inflammatory response is involved in the evolution of symptoms. Both polymorphonuclear and monocytic leukocytes infiltrate the sub-epithelium, which leads to vascular congestion and airway wall edema. In addition, the symptoms of viral LTB are believed to be caused by the release of spasmogenic mediators, leading to decreased airway diameter. This may result from a type I hypersensitivity response to PIV, and some authors have postulated a role for anti-PIV-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the development of airway narrowing.10 These factors may play a relatively greater role in patients with recurrent (spasmodic) croup, and these patients may have hyperreactivity of the extrathoracic and intrathoracic airways.11 The etiology of recurrent, spasmodic croup remains unclear, with authors expressing differing views on whether it is usually virus-related12 or is a separate disease entity; suggested triggers include gastroesophageal reflux and anatomical abnormalities in addition to an allergic predisposition.13\n",

Worrisome signs include those of increasing respiratory distress, with the child appearing anxious or preoccupied and tired. Drooling may occur, and the child will often refuse liquids or be unable to coordinate swallowing and breathing. However, the child with viral LTB will not appear toxic, with high fever and flushed face, as do those with the classic signs of bacterial epiglottitis (Table 25-1\n). Another difference is in the nature of the cough; a harsh, barking cough is not commonly associated with epiglottitis (in which there is often a muffled cough and cry). Restlessness and agitation are late signs of airway obstruction of any cause, as is cyanosis, pallor, or decreased level of consciousness. Pulse oximetry should be performed, but limitations must be recognized. Oxygen saturation may be well preserved until the late stages of severe viral LTB, and it can lead to significant underestimation of respiratory compromise in a patient who is receiving supplementary oxygen. Conversely, desaturation may be seen in children with relatively mild airway obstruction (presumably reflecting lower airway involvement and ventilation-perfusion mismatch).14 Pulsus paradoxus is present in this group with severe disease, but in clinical practice, it is difficult to assess, and attempts to do so could worsen symptoms by causing distress.",

            "text": "There are a number of non-infective causes of upper airway obstruction, and these must be considered in the differential diagnosis of infective causes (Box 25-1\n). Foreign body inhalation is the most common non-infective cause in children. Symptoms may partly mimic those of viral LTB and will depend on the location of the foreign body, the degree of resultant airway obstruction, and (to a lesser extent) the nature of the foreign body. Onset of symptoms may be either acute or insidious; a large foreign body may cause severe obstruction, whereas a smaller one may simply lead to laryngeal and tracheal irritation and airway edema. In cases of severe airway obstruction, the voice may be lost and breath sounds quiet. This condition is an emergency and requires immediate visualization of the larynx and trachea and removal of the foreign body by a physician or surgeon experienced in this procedure. Occasionally, an unrecognized inhaled foreign body leads to chronic stridor. Acute upper airway obstruction may also result from the ingestion of caustic substances, with resulting pharyngeal burns, edema, and inflammation of the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, larynx, and trachea. This diagnosis is usually clear from the history. Rarely, angioneurotic edema may cause acute laryngeal swelling and airway obstruction. Patients appear nontoxic and may exhibit other signs of allergic disease, such as urticaria and abdominal pain. In hereditary angioneurotic edema due to C1 esterase deficiency, the family history may be positive, although the first presentation is more common in adults than in children.Box 25-1Infectious and Noninfectious Causes of Acute Upper Airway ObstructionInfectious\nViral laryngotracheobronchitisEpiglottitisBacterial tracheitisDiphtheriaRetropharyngeal abscessPeritonsillar abscessInfectious mononucleosis\nNoninfectious\nForeign bodyTraumaCaustic burnsSpasmodic croupAngioneurotic edema\n",

Confusion may arise when an upper respiratory tract infection unmasks a previously asymptomatic congenital abnormality. For example, mild subglottic stenosis may cause symptoms only with the additional burden of airway edema due to a simple viral upper respiratory infection. It is important to ensure that there is no history of intubation (which may have been brief, as in resuscitation of a newborn in the maternity unit) or of any coexisting signs (e.g., a cutaneous hemangioma) that may increase the index of suspicion for a congenital airway abnormality.",

The lack of complete immunity and the variety of agents that can cause viral LTB mean that more than one episode is not uncommon, particularly in separate seasons. However, some children have symptoms that should lead to further clinical evaluation. These include multiple episodes, particularly if they are severe or frequent, symptoms that are particularly slow to resolve, and symptoms that occur between or in the absence of obvious infections. Evaluation of patients in this group is aimed at identifying an underlying airway abnormality that would predispose the child to more severe airway narrowing with viral infections, or that could cause problems independently of such infection. Investigation is usually centered on airway endoscopy. This must be performed in a unit and by an operator who is experienced in the technique because there is a risk in many of these conditions of exacerbating the airway obstruction. Spontaneous breathing is necessary to identify vocal cord problems or airway malacia, and anesthetic techniques must be carefully considered. If an inhaled foreign body is considered likely, rigid bronchoscopy is the study of choice. Additional studies that might be considered once the acute episode has resolved include plain lateral neck and chest radiographs, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan, contrast assessment of the upper airway (e.g., videofluoroscopy, barium swallow), and a pH study. Polysomnography may help to determine the severity of chronic symptoms. Rarer causes of recurrent stridor (e.g., hypocalcaemia or angioneurotic edema) are diagnosed by blood testing.",

            "text": "The role of corticosteroids in the management of croup in children has been the subject of several Cochrane reviews, with the most recent update in November 2004.22 In this review, the authors identified 31 studies that fulfilled their criteria for inclusion, namely, randomized controlled trials in children measuring the effectiveness of corticosteroids (any route of administration) against either a placebo or another treatment. A total of 3736 children were included, the majority from placebo-controlled trials. Outcome measures included the croup score (most commonly the Westley scale), the requirement for admission or return visit, the length of stay, and the requirement for additional therapeutic interventions. Overall, treatment led to an improvement in the croup score at 6 and 12 hours, but the improvement was no longer apparent at 24 hours. The length of time spent in either the emergency department or the hospital was also significantly decreased, as was the requirement for nebulized epinephrine. Importantly, and in contrast to the previous version of the Cochrane review, the authors concluded with funnel plots and other statistical methods that these results were not influenced by publication bias.22 Since this publication, one further large randomized controlled trial (n  =  720) studied mild croup (Westley score  \u2264  2), and showed benefit of a single dose of dexamethasone, 0.6 mg/kg, in terms of return to medical care, resolution of symptoms, decreased loss of sleep by the child, and reduced parental stress.23 In conclusion, the case for corticosteroids is now clear. In severe disease, rates of intubation are significantly decreased and the duration of intubation is reduced, and in moderate disease admission, the need for additional treatment and return visits are reduced.8 More recent studies have focused attention on the optimal formulation, dose, and treatment regimen.",

It has a rapid onset of action (within 30 minutes), and the effect lasts for 2 to 3 hours. The recommended dose is 0.4 to 0.5 mL/kg (to a maximum of 5 mL) of the 1:1000 preparation that is put undiluted into the nebulizer pot. According to these studies, nebulized epinephrine has been shown to improve the croup score and reduce the likelihood of hospital admission, but it is less clear whether, when given with corticosteroids, it reduces the need for intubation. It should be used in any child who has severe signs and symptoms, and it should be considered for those with moderate signs and symptoms, depending on the signs of respiratory distress and possible response to corticosteroid administration. It can be administered in the home setting while awaiting an ambulance, but, clearly, any child requiring this treatment at home must be transferred promptly to the hospital for monitoring. Multiple doses may be administered, although the requirement for this must lead to consideration of the need for intensive care management. Although rebound worsening of symptoms after administration of nebulized epinephrine is often alluded to, in practice, this phenomenon does not appear to be a real risk. Traditionally, children treated with epinephrine have been admitted to the hospital, but recent studies have confirmed that discharge home is safe after 3 to 4 hours of observation if the child has made significant improvement.31\n",

As mentioned earlier, a child with severe respiratory distress and obstruction may have relatively normal pulse oximetry readings when breathing oxygen, which can be dangerous if misinterpreted by staff who are unaware of this limitation. Heliox (70% to 80% helium with 20% to 30% oxygen) has been used in both upper airway obstruction32 and severe asthma, and it is the focus of a recent Cochrane review.33 Only two small randomized controlled trials were identified, totaling 44 patients with severe croup. Heliox was compared with either 30% humidified oxygen or with 100% oxygen plus epinephrine. There was no additional benefit of Heliox, although further well-designed controlled trials were recommended. Some children with severe croup either do not respond to the usual therapies or are too severely compromised at presentation to permit their use. These children require urgent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to avoid potentially catastrophic complete airway obstruction and the serious sequelae of hypoxia and hypercapnia (e.g., hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy). Intubation should be performed by the most experienced person available, and it should be attempted with an uncuffed endotracheal tube one size smaller than the usual size for the child.34 Facilities for immediate tracheostomy must be available at the time of intubation. Children may have coexisting lower airway and parenchymal involvement that impairs gas exchange and may lead to slower than expected clinical improvement after intubation. Rarely, pulmonary edema may develop after relief of airway obstruction, particularly if the disease course has been prolonged. Most children without severe parenchymal involvement require respiratory support for 3 to 5 days.34 This is one context in which multiple rather than single doses of corticosteroids are often administered. The timing of extubation will depend on the development of an air leak, indicating resolution of airway narrowing.34 Re-intubation rates of approximately 10% have been reported.35\n",

Viral co-infection may have a role in the transition from colonization to invasion.45 Colonies of HiB organisms reside in the nasal mucosal epithelium and submucosa. Invasive disease occurs when organisms disseminate from the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract via the bloodstream; bacteremia increases over a period of hours, and metastatic seeding can occur.44 Thus, although situated in close proximity to the nose, the supraglottic area is likely to be affected via the bloodstream; direct spread along mucosal surfaces may also play a part. This may account for the relatively high yield of positive blood cultures in epiglottitis and the relatively low incidence of epiglottitis among carriers of HiB.",

It is a medical emergency that can be alarming for the medical staff and devastating for the family. Epiglottitis clearly has not been eliminated, but due to its rarity there are concerns about a potential lack of familiarity with its management among emergency physicians, pediatricians, anesthesiologists, and otolaryngologists.46 Up to 20% of infants with epiglottitis are misdiagnosed initially, usually with viral LTB.4 Typically, there is a short history of fever, severe throat pain, stridor, and respiratory distress, but the symptoms progress rapidly. Children become toxic and tend to sit anxiously in the classic tripod position (sitting upright, with the chin up, mouth open, bracing themselves on their hands) as air hunger develops (Fig. 25-3\n). They often drool because they cannot swallow their secretions, and the voice is muffled due to pain and soft tissue swelling. Stridor may progress, and when marked, signals almost complete obstruction of the airways. Complete, fatal airway obstruction may occur suddenly and without warning. The most serious complication of this disease process (and any infective upper airway obstruction) is hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy resulting from respiratory arrest. This tragic complication is almost always preventable with clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and correct management. However, a recent 13-year case series demonstrated that cardiac arrest occurred in 3 of 40 cases (7.5%), although there were no long-term sequelae.40 Secondary sites of HiB infection may be present in approximately half of cases, and include meningitis, otitis media, pneumonia, and cellulitis; therefore, repeated physical examination during the admission is critical.2 The pneumonia may contribute to poor gas exchange.",

In a recent series, 57% of patients required intubation, which is lower than the rate previously reported.50 The decision to extubate is based on clinical improvement, with reduction of fever, decreased airway secretions, and development of an air leak around the endotracheal tube. Corticosteroids may be given before extubation. Tracheostomy is required less often than in the past.

Large outbreaks occurred in the 1990s throughout Russia and the independent countries of the former Soviet Union (nearly 50,000 cases were reported). In 2005, 36 countries reported almost 13,000 cases to the World Health Organization, and 80% were from India.57 The last childhood deaths reported in the UK were 1 in 1994 and 1 in 2008.58 Most life-threatening cases occurred in unvaccinated or inadequately immunized persons, and it is important for children traveling to these countries, particularly for extended periods, to be vaccinated. A list of endemic countries is available on the Centers for Disease Control website (\nwwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/diphtheria.htm\n). Adults are particularly at risk because protective levels of diphtheria antibodies decrease progressively with time from immunization, so re-immunization is recommended before travel. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of U.S. residents (1988 to 1994) indicated that fully protective levels (\u2265 0.1 IU/mL) were found in 91% of children 6 to 11 years of age, but only in 30% of adults 60 to 69 years of age.59\n",

Intravenous dexamethasone has been given to children with laryngeal diphtheria and airway obstruction, and a small case series suggested that it was beneficial.63 Because the disease may not confer immunity, patients should be given a diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine during convalescence.

Children then have high fever, sore throat, dysphagia, poor feeding, neck pain, and stiffness. Limitation of neck extension and torticollis are more common than limited neck flexion.66 Although the occurrence of neck signs with fever may suggest meningitis, children tend not to be as toxic as those with meningitis. Further deterioration may lead to extrathoracic airway compromise, with drooling, stridor, and respiratory distress. The classical picture of stridor and airway obstruction seems to be less common now, and in a series of cases reported by pediatricians from 1993 to 1998, only 3% of 64 children in Salt Lake City had stridor or wheezing.66 However in a series of cases from 2002 to 2007 from the same center, but published by the otolaryngologists, 14/130 (11%) presented with airways obstruction, and 50% required intubation, with an average age of 1.4 years.70 Older series have reported a higher incidence of stridor. Reported rates include 71% in patients younger than 1 year of age, 43% in patients older than 1 year of age, and no stridor in those older than 3 years of age in a series of 31 children in Sydney, Australia71; a rate of 56% in 17 patients in Denver72; and a rate of 23% in 65 children in Los Angeles.73 It is possible that the spectrum of disease is changing, but it is more likely that the diagnosis is being made earlier, before the airways are compromised.66 Sometimes a retropharyngeal mass is visible in the mouth, seen as an asymmetrical bulge of the posterior pharyngeal wall (Fig. 25-5\n), or a neck mass (marked lymphadenopathy or parapharyngeal abscess) is visible and palpable. Complications include rupture of the abscess with aspiration, asphyxiation or pneumonia, extension to a mediastinal abscess, Lemierre's syndrome, and vascular complications (e.g., thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and erosion through the carotid artery sheath).64\n,\n69\n",

Corticosteroids are not uncommonly used but are of no obvious benefit (or harm).78 Treatment often involves needle aspiration or incision and drainage; a meta-analysis of 10 studies with 496 patients revealed an average 94% success rate with simple needle aspiration.80 Nevertheless, an initial period of medical treatment is appropriate in the absence of airway compromise and systemic toxicity, especially in younger children.81 There is some debate among otolaryngologists about the role and timing of tonsillectomy, and peritonsillar abscess is no longer considered an absolute indication for tonsillectomy, although a history of recurrent tonsillitis prior to developing the peritonsillar abscess leads to a higher recurrence rate.82\n",

During inspiration, negative intratracheal pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure) leads to dynamic collapse of the extrathoracic airway, thus worsening the effects of an extrathoracic obstructive lesion. In contrast, intrathoracic obstruction improves during inspiration because the elastic recoil of the lung parenchyma opens the intrathoracic airways. During expiration, intratracheal pressure is positive relative to atmospheric pressure, opening the extrathoracic trachea and lessening the obstructive effect of lesions. In contrast, intrathoracic obstruction worsens because of lower pressure in the airways relative to the surrounding parenchyma, collapsing the airways.",
