There is a constant need for information as new organisms emerge, existing ones develop resistance to current drugs or vaccines, and there are changes in epidemiology and prevalence. In the twenty-first century, obtaining this information has never been more important. Population migration, and the relatively low cost of flying, means that unfamiliar infectious diseases may be brought into industrialized countries. An example of this was an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was first recognized in 2003. Despite modern technology and a huge input of money, it took months for the agent to be identified, a diagnostic test to be produced, and a strategy for disease reporting and isolation to be established.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A further example of how population migration can result in the spreading of disease was with the appearance of swine influenza A (H1N1).

Challenges ensued with decisions about treatment and then the distribution and administration of specific vaccine.

The earliest case was believed to have originated in the Guandong province of China on 16 November 2002. The causative agent was identified as a new Corona virus-SARS-CoV[77,78]. By the end of June 2003, 8422 cases had been reported from 31 different countries with a total of 916 deaths. Approximately 92% of cases occurred in China (including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao). The case fatality rate varied from <1% in people less than 24 years old, to over 50% in persons 65 or older. On 5 July 2003, the WHO reported that the last human chain of transmission of SARS had been broken and lifted the ban from all countries. However, they warned that everyone should remain vigilant, as resurgence of SARS was still a possibility and this indeed proved the case with reports ongoing until May 2004. Since then, there have been no further reported cases. Knowledge about the epidemiology and ecology of SARS-CoV and the disease remains limited; however, the experience gained from the previous outbreak enabled the disease to be contained rapidly-reflected in the few cases reported since December. There is still no specific treatment or preventative vaccine that has been developed to date.Another coronavirus, MERS-CoV was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 which causes a similar clinical picture to SARS. This zoonotic disease is acquired by humans through direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. Since 2012 27 countries have reported cases of MERS including Algeria, Austria, Bahrain, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, Jordan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey the UK, the USA and Yemen. Over 90% of all reported cases have been from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Cases outside the Middle East have originated in travellers to that area. There was one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea with 186 cases reported Approximately 35% of patients with MERS have died but this may be an overestimate as milder cases that are not being reported are not included.
