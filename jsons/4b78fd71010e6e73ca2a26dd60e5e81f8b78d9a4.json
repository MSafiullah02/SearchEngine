Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu's arteritis (TA) are characterized by infl ammation directed against the vessel wall. GCA and TA display stringent tissue tropism and affect defi ned vascular territories in a preferential manner. GCA predominantly affects the second-to fi fth-order aortic branches, often in the extracranial arteries of the head. The aorta itself may also be affected in GCA, albeit less often than other regions. In contrast, in TA, the aorta and its major branches are the prime disease targets.",

Macrophages in the adventitia, intermingling with activated T cells, produce interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta. Macrophages in the medial layer are specialized in the production of metalloproteinases, and also contribute to oxidative damage. End products of lipid peroxidation, a cell injury mechanism driven by oxygen radicals, are typically found on medial smooth muscle cells (5) . Macrophages recruited to the intimal layer are committed to the production of nitric oxide synthase-2. Nitric oxide is suspected to be involved in tissue injury, cellular activation, and vascular remodeling. Multinucleated giant cells, once assumed to function in the removal of indigestible debris, are actually active secretory cells, producing molecular mediators relevant in structurally changing the arterial wall.

The major vascular abnormality leading to clinical disease is a nonthrombotic luminal occlusion, caused by rapid and concentric growth of the intima. These structural alterations result from the response to injury elicited in arterial cells ( Figure 21A -2). Intimal hyperplasia is generated by the mobilization of smooth muscle cells, their directed migration towards the lumen, and their proliferation and matrix deposition. This process is under the control of growth factors. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a factor with the capability of supporting the outgrowth of the hyperplastic intima, is present in infl amed arteries. PDGF derives from macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Patients with low PDGF production have no or minimal lumen-occlusive intimal proliferation. In contrast, those with excessive PDGF production are at a risk for ischemic complications (8) .",

The arterial response pattern initiated by the production of PDGF and VEGF leads to profound structural arterial abnormalities with subsequent stenosis and tissue ischemia, emphasizing that the immune system coerces the artery toward a counterproductive pattern of reaction.

Further evidence for this systemic component is the activation in GCA patients of circulating monocytes, which produce IL-1 and IL-6.

Several noninvasive imaging techniques are informative for assessing progression of occlusive disease, but currently lack standardization and are subject to investigator bias and experience. Far more problematic than assessing the degree of stenosis within a given blood vessel is the reliable assessment of infl ammatory activity by imaging. MRI/A has largely replaced conventional angiography for serial assessments of the distribution and degree of vessel involvement, and also permits evaluations of the vessel wall as well as the lumen. MRI/A is particularly important in the longitudinal monitoring of TA although, as noted, the correct interpretation of all MRI/A fi ndings is not always clear. MRI/A has clear utility in monitoring the progress or stability of vascular stenoses, provided that serial studies are compared carefully for changes. Doppler ultrasound provides a good assessment of cervical vessels. Computed tomography angiography can be used to survey the aorta and proximal vessels, but rigorous serial studies of its use in TA remain to be performed.

The patient described by Kussmaul and Maier was a 27-year-old male with fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, and a polyneuropathy that progressed over the period of 1 month to paralysis.

According to current convention, and as described in this text, PAN is a vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries. PAN is also not associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), at least not those directed against proteinase-3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO) that are such a distinctive feature of the majority of cases of Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and, to a lesser extent, the Churg-Strauss syndrome. Although patients may be P-ANCA-positive on immunofl uorescence testing, enzyme immunoassays for PR3-and MPO-ANCA are negative in PAN. Further, in contrast to the ANCA-associated vasculitides (see Chapter 21C), PAN does not involve either the lungs or blood vessels as small as the renal glomeruli (which are essentially capillaries).",

After treatment with 6 months of cyclophosphamide, patients in remission-the great majority-should be switched to another immunosuppressive agent for remission maintenance. As with the ANCA-associated vasculitides, azathioprine or methotrexate is often used. After a total treatment length of approximately 18 months, the remission maintenance agent can often be stopped, with a low relapse rate.

Conversely, poor outcomes also result from undertreatment, for example, failure to employ cyclophosphamide in a patient clearly failing highdose glucocorticoids. An important aspect of treatment is avoiding known side effects of agents used. This includes the use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in all patients on glucocorticoids, along with use of a bisphosphonate in those at high risk for bone loss and monitoring of bone density. Patients on cyclophosphamide should have routine monitoring for cytopenias and hematuria and receive trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole for prevention of Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii) pneumonia. Patients receiving pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide are also candidates for MESNA (sodium-2-sulfanyl ethanesulfonate) for prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis. Premenopausal females on cyclophosphamide are candidates for leuprolide to suppress the GnRH axis and prevent premature ovarian failure; males may opt to bank sperm. Finally, as a teratogen, patients should not become pregnant or father children on cyclophosphamide. Multiple antibodies may lead to positive immunofl uorescence testing for ANCA in either perinuclear (P-ANCA) or cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) patterns. However, only antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase-3 (PR3) are associated with the AAV. Wegener's granulomatosis may be associated with destructive upper respiratory tract disease, including saddle-nose deformity, erosive sinusitis, and subglottic stenosis. The CSS is often associated with allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis, or sinusitis, but is rarely associated with destructive lesions. A host of ocular lesions may occur in the AAV, including episcleritis, scleritis, peripheral ulcerative keratitis, and orbital pseudotumor. Lung disease is common in the AAV and ranges from asthma (in CSS) to nodular lesions with a tendency to cavitate (in WG) to interstitial lung disease (MPA) to alveolar hemorrhage (all forms of AAV). Segmental, necrotizing glomerulonephritis commonly accompanies the AAV, particularly WG and MPA. Eosinophilia is the sine qua non of CSS.",

Curiously, at the time the vasculitic phase begins, patients' asthma often improves signifi cantly. The histopathological fi ndings in CSS in the lung include eosinophilic infi ltrates; extensive areas of necrosis (reminiscent of the geographic necrosis in WG); a granulomatous vasculitis of small arteries and veins, associated with striking eosinophilic infi ltration. In contrast to WG and MPA, lymphadenopathy (with overwhelming eosinophilic infi ltration into the lymph nodes), is frequently found in CSS.",

ANCAs produce tissue damage via interactions with primed neutrophils and endothelial cells. The hypothesis, supported strongly by in vitro evidence, is that the antibodies induce a necrotizing vasculitis by inciting a respiratory burst and degranulation of leukocytes (neutrophils and monocytes), leading to endothelial injury. The initial events in the process require the priming of leukocytes by cytokines and perhaps other stimuli, leading to the expression of PR3 and MPO on the cell surface. The effects of ANCAs are determined by the state of neutrophil activation.

Moreover, most patients with AAVs produce isotype-switched IgG ANCA, implying a secondary immune response driven by T cells. Growing evidence, particularly data from clinical studies (18) , now also implicates B cells as important participants in the infl ammation of AAV. As the precursors of plasma cells (which produce ANCA), B cells now seem a logical therapeutic target in AAV. In addition to disrupting ANCA production, however, interference with B-cell function may also ameliorate AAV by disabling critical B cell/T cell interactions, by removing the antigen presenting function of B cells, and perhaps other mechanisms.

The treatment of MPA parallels very closely that of severe WG. Because of the propensity of MPA to involve major organs (lungs, kidneys, peripheral nerves) in a severe fashion, limited forms of the disease are recognized less often.

First, a strong clue to the presence of mixed cryoglobulinemia is an extremely low (to almost undetectable) level of C4. For reasons that are not entirely clear, C4 levels are lowered out of proportion to the decrease observed in C3. Second, the monoclonal component of type II cryoglobulins almost invariably has rheumatoid factor activity (i.e., binds to the Fc portion of IgG). Thus, essentially all patients with type II cryoglobulinemia are rheumatoid factor-positive-usually strikingly so. In many cases, rheumatoid factor tests are a more reliable screening test for type II cryoglobulinemia than are assays for cryoglobulins themselves. Although rheumatoid factor titers correlate with immunoglobulin burden in such patients and can be used in longitudinal follow-up in a manner similar to the cryocrit, the level of clinical symptomatology often correlates poorly with both rheumatoid factor level and cryocrit. Once patients have achieved a state of disease quiescence following treatment, both rheumatoid factor levels and cryocrit often remain elevated. Neither should be used as a gauge of therapy for most patients. Finally, acute-phase reactants such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein are elevated in many patients with cryoglobulinemia. In patients with type I cryoglobulinemia, for example, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be even higher than anticipated because of the excess circulating immunoglobulin.",

The ocular fi nding in Beh\u00e7et's original patients was anterior uveitis associated with a hypopyon [the accumulation of an infl ammatory cell infi ltrate-essentially pus-in the anterior chamber ( Figure 21E-3) ]. Anterior uveitis that is not treated promptly with a mydriatic agent may result in synechiae formation between the iris and the lens and permanent papillary distortion. The ocular manifestations of Beh\u00e7et's disease may also include a panuveitis, however, with posterior chamber involvement and retinal vasculitis, the complications of which may extend to visual loss. Retinal vasculitis, which leads to episodes of retinal occlusion and areas of ischemia, may be followed by neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage and contraction, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. The earliest fi ndings of retinal vasculitis may be detected with fl uorescein angiography. Isolated optic disk edema in BD suggests cerebral venous thrombosis rather than ocular disease, but papillitis may occur with ocular infl ammation and central nervous system disease. Cranial nerve palsies may result from brain stem lesions, and visual fi eld defects may also be caused by intracranial disease involving the optic pathways.",

Presenting manifestations include sudden hearing loss, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's-like vertigo and tinnitus, and ocular infl ammation, alone or in any combination (22) . Other features of the disease, if not present initially, usually follow within several months. Hearing loss is bilateral, shows a downsloping pattern on audiograms, and is often progressive and profound. Vestibular testing shows bilateral cochlear dysfunction, helping to distinguish this disorder from M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's syndrome. In comparison to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's syndrome, the damage to hearing from Cogan's syndrome is typically more unremitting. Scleritis, uveitis, or other infl ammatory conditions of the eye ( Figure 21E -7) may be present initially but often patients will subsequently develop interstitial keratitis if not present initially. Systemic manifestations include headache, fever, arthralgia, and vasculitis, with or without aortitis.

To date, however, no infectious etiology has been proven. There has been no culture or serologic evidence for conventional viral agents, Mycoplasmae, Rickettsiae, or bacterial agents (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus). Molecular biologic techniques have provided support, however, for a Propionibacterium acnes variant, retroviruses, Rickettsiae, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, and coronavirus, as well as for the participation of the S. aureus toxin TSST-1 and other superantigens (e.g., Yersinia pseudotuberulosis). Support exists for a superantigen-mediated process both from clinical studies (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) and from a murine model for coronary arteritis stimulated by Lactobacillus casei cell wall extracts (23) . This hypothesis proposes that the etiologic agents-which may differ across geographic sites throughout the world-are capable of evoking immunologic responses via T-cell receptor V beta restriction. An oligoclonal response is supported by the discovery of IgA-secreting plasma cells within gia and arthritis, aseptic meningitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pericardial effusion, obstructive jaundice, and hydrops of the gallbladder. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), a critical medication in the treatment of KD, is a limited resource in many parts of the world because of its expense. The American Heart Association (AHA), concerned about both the potential for overuse of IVIG as well as the failure to employ this medication in a timely manner in appropriate patients, issued guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of KD (Tables 21F-2 through 21F-4) (12, 13) . In these guidelines, the epidemiologic case defi nition of KD included fever of at least 4 days and four or more principal criteria (Table  21F -1) without other explanation; or fever and less than four principal criteria if coronary artery abnormalities are detected by echocardiogram or coronary angiography.",

If aspirin doses are too high (e.g., 100-150 mg/kg/day), improvement of intestinal absorption with therapy may lead to symptoms of toxicity. In Japan, doses of 30 to 50 mg/kg/day have been employed because of the high incidence of the slowacetylator gene in the Japanese population.

A regimen of 20 mg/kg/day of pentoxifylline in three divided doses demonstrated an improvement in clinical features and the rate of aneurysm formation in KD (40) . Further pharmacokinetic studies of a commercial liquid preparation of pentoxifylline demonstrated safety and a reduction in TNF levels in KD patients of 28% with doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (41) . Anecdotal reports indicate tolerability of doses of 40 to 60 mg/kg/day in infants with KD. A multicenter trial of infl iximab in KD is currently under way (42, 43) .",
