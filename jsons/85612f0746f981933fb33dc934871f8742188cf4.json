One group was vaccinated with two doses of feline leukemia virus vaccine according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All 20 cats were challenge exposed oronasally (4 times over a 1-week period), beginning 3 weeks after immunization, with a virulent subgroup A strain of FeLV (CT600-FeLV). The severity of the FeLV infection was enhanced by treating the cats with methylprednisolone acetate at the time of the last FeLV exposure. Ten of 10 nonvaccinated cats became persistently viremic compared with 0/10 of the vaccinates. ELISA antibodies to whole FeLV were present at high concentrations after immunization in all of the vaccinated cats, and there was no observable anamnestic antibody response after challenge exposure. ELISA antibodies to whole FeLV appeared at low concentrations in the serum of nonvaccinated cats after infection but disappeared as the viremia became permanently established. Virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in 3/10 vaccinates and 0/10 nonvaccinates immediately before FeLV challenge exposure, and in 8/10 vaccinates and 1/10 nonvaccinates 5 weeks later. Although vaccination did not consistently evoke virus neutralizing antibodies, it appeared to immunologically prime cats for a virus-neutralizing antibody response after infection. Active AT LEAST three new feline leukemia virus (FeLV) vaccines have appeared on the market during 199 1, Two of these vaccines are conventional inactivated and adjuvanted whole virus whereas the third is a true viral subunit vaccine containing FeLV envelope protein expressed in ba~teria.~ Reports from each manufacturer indicate that their respective vaccine provides a high degree of protection against artificial challenge-exposure with virulent virus. 1-3 The manufacturers' efficacy data has been confirmed in semi-independent studies for two of these",

The average absorbance values of the triplicate test wells were calculated.

A strong positive reaction (+) was equal to a 75-100% reduction in FeLV-p27 antigen production. a weak positive reaction (f) correlated with a 50-75? reduction, and a negative reaction (-) correlated with a 0-50% reduction.
