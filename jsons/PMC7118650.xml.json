In the study by Yang and colleagues,1 who compared clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19, five (83%) of six patients receiving ECMO died. Although this sample was small, and specific baseline characteristics and disease courses were almost unknown, it raises concerns about potential harms of ECMO therapy for COVID-19.",

During ECMO, substantial decreases in the number and function of some populations of lymphocytes is commonplace.3 As it might be hypothesised that repletion of lymphocytes could be key to recovery from COVID-19, lymphocyte count should be closely monitored in these patients receiving ECMO.",

During ECMO, IL-6 concentrations are consistently elevated and inversely correlated with survival in children and adults.4 Those that survived ECMO were able to normalise their IL-6 concentrations, whereas those that died had persistently elevated values. Moreover, elevated IL-6 concentrations in lung induced by initiation of ECMO have been convincingly shown to be associated with parenchymal damage in animal models of venovenous ECMO.5\n",
