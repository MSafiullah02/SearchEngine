            "text": "In a recent study, Marton and Pang (2012) investigated how 10-year-old children learned to see price as a function of demand and supply by using a computerized auction game with which the students interacted individually. To achieve this understanding, children had to learn to discern demand, to discern supply, and to be able to focus on both simultaneously. The conjecture implies that a necessary condition for this understanding is first the experience of variation in demand (a focused aspect, or what the children are supposed to learn to discern) and invariance in supply (also a focused aspect), then the experience of variation in supply and invariance in demand, and finally the experience of variation in both simultaneously. Such variation must occur against a background of invariance in the unfocused aspect of the item in question. Accordingly, variation in demand and invariance in supply, and then invariance in demand and variation in supply, followed by variation in both, is consistent with the conjecture if the item is the same throughout. There are, however, many ways in which a pattern of variation and invariance may be inconsistent with the conjecture. In Marton and Pang\u2019s (2012) study, the unfocused aspect, the good for auction, varied under the condition compared with the pattern consistent with the conjecture. This seemingly minor difference had a highly significant effect on learning. This was the second experimental study in which the conjecture was put to the test and supported by the findings. (The two patterns of variation and invariance compared in this study are shown in Fig. 2).\n",

This time, the comparison was made with a pattern in which the unfocused aspect was consistent with the conjecture, but the focused aspects were not. We had carried out a similar comparison (Pang and Marton 2007) previously in a follow-up study on the effects of changes in the relative magnitude of demand and supply on changes in price (Marton and Pang 2006). Two groups of economics students of the same level were taught by two teachers judged to be equally skillful. The introduction to the topic was framed in terms of the same single example for both groups (in the original study, it was used by the more successful group). The example was changes in the demand, supply, and price of face masks during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. The lesson design in Marton and Pang\u2019s (2006) original study using the same item was dramatically superior to the design in which different products were used. In the follow-up study, both groups used the same example, and hence the same product. However, in the experimental group the teacher used learning tasks that concerned change in demand and the magnitude of change in demand, with supply kept invariant, and learning tasks involving change in supply and the magnitude of change in supply, with demand kept invariant. In contrast, the teacher of the comparison group used learning tasks concerning concurrent changes in demand and supply and the magnitude of changes in both. For both groups, the lesson culminated with a fusion component in which all aspects were varied at the same time. After this introduction, both groups received the same formal instruction explaining what happens to prices when there are simultaneous changes in both demand and supply and in the magnitude of those changes. The experimental group convincingly outperformed the comparison group. The teacher\u2019s effort in the experimental group to make it possible for the students to discern the two critical aspects of demand and supply and changes in their magnitudes separately was obviously useful (see Fig. 3). The students in the comparison group dealt with the same issues (but encountering changes in demand, supply and in the magnitude of those changes simultaneously) when working in groups. Under that condition, the students did not seem to be equally successful in discerning the critical factors of changes in price (differences in the relative magnitude of changes in demand and supply. The price went up, for instance, when both demand and supply increased, but the increase in demand was greater).\n",

However, surprisingly, after this move the price of live chickens in the market did not increase but fell. Why? Please explain.\nSome years ago, VCDs were rather expensive, and many people turned to buying pirated VCDs. Many shops sold these pirated VCDs. Over the past few years, however, Hong Kong customs has put great effort into stopping the illegal trade in pirated VCDs, and there are now fewer shops that sell them. Interestingly, the price of pirated VCDs has not gone up, but has remained more or less the same as in the past. Why? Can you explain this?\n",

We were then able to show that the former pattern (consistent) was more conducive to learning than the latter (not consistent). However, it is questionable whether we can say that, in general, one particular pattern is consistent with the conjecture and another is not. The kind of learning that we are interested in is the appropriation of new meanings. If the meanings are new for all involved, then we can assume that it is more likely that learning will occur if the pattern of variation and invariance is consistent with the basic conjecture of the theory. However, it is very difficult to find a meaning that is within the reach of a group of learners, but have not been discerned by any of them previously.

In the tone learning study, it was critical for learners to learn to discern the tone aspect and relate it to the meaning aspect. Hence, the learner needed to encounter words that differed in tone but not in segments (vowel and consonant sounds). These words also differed in meaning. Thus, learning to discern was the first task. In the case of the Chinese words, however, the learners were native speakers of Chinese. They could already pronounce the words, or at least easily imitate their pronunciation. They could probably write some of them and understand the meaning\u2014at least partially\u2014of most of them. They had no doubt already discerned the three aspects of the words and in all likelihood knew one or several features of the words to be learned. They did not need to learn to discern the aspects, but rather needed to learn how to bring the aspects together and thus draw on the linguistic resources that they already possessed to appropriate new meanings. Accordingly, fusion was a more powerful pattern of variation and invariance in the case of the Chinese words. In the case of the Cantonese tones, the reverse was true.",

It is not the case that once someone has achieved a certain level, he or she can attain that level in all scenarios. Rather, we argue that to master any problem the learner must be able to discern the critical features and to focus on them simultaneously, which involves being able to separate the critical and non-critical features from the object of learning and bring the former together. Variation Theory cannot tell us which pattern of variation and invariance to try to bring about. It only holds that this pattern is what matters, because experiencing it is what it takes to learn something. Anyone trying to help another person to learn has to determine the object of learning in each specific case.

As we have argued, it is very likely that the pattern of variation and invariance that learners need depends on what they have already mastered. In this case, the students who had already discerned demand and supply, that is, those who expressed Conception C or D in the pre-test, did not need support to discern demand and supply. Most of those expressing Conception C needed support to bring the critical aspects that were discerned together. In other words, they needed to encounter fusion, whereby both critical features vary simultaneously, which is exactly what Text B accomplished. Accordingly, students expressing Conception C or D in the pre-test who learned using Text B should have achieved better results than those who learned with Text A (which was in part redundant for what the students had to learn).",

In accordance with our expectations, the two texts had a markedly different effect on the two groups of students. In the group with better results in the pre-test, 33.3 % more of the students working with Text A and 68.8 % more of those working with Text B expressed the target understanding (Conception D) in the post-test relative to the pre-test. The corresponding figures for the group with poorer pre-test results were 68.8 and 36.1 %, respectively. Text A seemed to be better aligned for the group with poorer results in the pre-test, and Text B for the group with better results in the pre-test. Helping the students to discern demand or supply when they can already do it without any help seems to have a negative effect on learning. The percentage increase in students reaching the target understanding was exactly the same in both groups when they worked with the texts that were best aligned for them. When working with texts that were not so aligned, however, the initially weaker group performed slightly better despite a lack of overlap between the two groups in the pre-test. This finding indicates a remarkably strong interaction between the pre-test results and the different patterns of variation and invariance in the texts. This interaction is illustrated in Tables 3, 4 and Fig. 7. The results are again consistent with the theory, in this fourth experimental study in which it was put to the test.\n\n\n",

The concept was not successful, but we nevertheless argue that it is reasonable to expect that efforts to help students to learn should build upon what they have learned previously. The educational objectives that are formulated for specific levels, curricular units, or even single lessons are the same for all students. However, every educational objective is a complex of component parts, some of which some students will already have learned, and others not. Educational objectives do not tell us what the students need to learn; they tell us what the students are expected to become able to do. However, powerful teaching must take as its point of departure that which students need to learn. Where it does so, it contributes to powerful learning, as we have tried to demonstrate with this study. The object of learning for the students who had not discerned demand and supply before the lessons was to learn to make such discernments, but also to bring the critical aspects together and arrive at an understanding of the role of the relative magnitude of changes in demand and supply. The object of learning for the students who had discerned demand and supply before the lesson was simply to bring the two critical aspects together and to arrive at an understanding of the effect of relative magnitude of change in demand and supply on changes in price. The educational objective, or learning target, was the same for both groups, but the object of learning in terms of critical features differed. The conclusion is that we should try to differentiate instructional approaches in accordance with differences among students. The differences that should be considered, however, should be differences that are specific to the particular objects of learning rather than differences in basic psychological abilities.",

The implication of this conjecture is that experienced patterns of difference and sameness play a key role in learning, especially in learning that entails appropriating novel meanings, which is also referred to as conceptual learning. Meaning is defined here as the various features of a phenomenon that are discerned by the learner and focused on simultaneously. Discerning a feature amounts to separating it from that which it is a feature of, as well as from other features. According to the conjecture, such separation presupposes the experience of variation in that which is to be separated and the experience of sameness in that from which the feature in question has to be separated. Our previous study reported on the role of the experience of sameness as a background against which variation is experienced. In the two studies in this paper, we demonstrated that the pattern of variation and invariance that learners need to experience is a function both of differences in the object of learning and differences among learners. This finding makes it obvious that unless the new meaning to be appropriated is new to all learners, there are no generalized \u201cbest patterns of variation and invariance,\u201d but rather more and less powerful patterns for a certain object of learning and for certain learners.",
