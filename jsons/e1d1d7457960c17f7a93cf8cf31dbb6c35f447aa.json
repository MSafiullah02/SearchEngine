CoV genomes encode four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), matrix (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Two betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), caused serious epidemics over the past two decades. 8 Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV. 9 Although the viral pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, recent studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensinconverting enzyme II (ACE2) as a cellular entry receptor; ACE2 is also a well-known host cell receptor for SARS-CoV. 10 SARS-CoV-2 colocalizes with ACE2 in animal cells, 11 and its spike (S) protein binds ACE2 with high affinity. 12, 13 For emerging pathogens, real-time reverse transcription\u2212 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the primary means of diagnosis. Currently, real-time RT-PCR is used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on previously published laboratory protocols. 14 SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and is currently spreading rapidly around the world; the rate of COVID-19 transmission is much faster than those of SARS and MERS. Moreover, cases of asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission have been reported. 15, 16 Molecular diagnosis using real-time RT-PCR takes at least 3 h, including preparation of viral RNA. In addition, the RNA preparation step can affect diagnostic accuracy. Hence, highly sensitive immunological diagnostic methods that directly detect viral antigens in clinical samples without sample preparation steps are necessary for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.",

Graphene is a two-dimensional sheet of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms, all of which are exposed on its surface. 19 It has proven to be a useful material for various sensing platforms due to its extraordinary properties, including high electronic conductivity, high carrier mobility, and large specific area. 20 Graphene-based FET biosensors can detect surrounding changes on their surface and provide an optimal sensing environment for ultrasensitive and low-noise detection. From this standpoint, graphene-based FET technology is very attractive for applications related to sensitive immunological diagnosis. 21, 22 In this study, we developed a graphene-based biosensing device functionalized with SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody (COVID-19 FET sensor) for use as a SARS-CoV-2 virus detection platform. SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody was immobilized onto the fabricated device through 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (PBASE), an efficient interface coupling agent used as a probe linker ( Figure 1 ). Our COVID-19 FET sensor detects target SARS-CoV-2 antigen protein with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 fg/mL. Most critical of all, we confirmed the potential for clinical application by detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen protein in transport medium used for nasopharyngeal swabs and cultured SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as SARS-CoV-2 virus from clinical samples. Furthermore, our sensor could distinguish the SARS-CoV-2 antigen protein from those of MERS-CoV. These results demonstrate the successful fabrication of a COVID-19 FET sensor based on integration of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody with graphene, enabling highly sensitive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical samples.",

            "text": "Fabrication and Characterization of Biosensing Device. Figure 2A depicts the optical image of the COVID-19 FET sensor. The dimensions of the sensing area were 100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm 2 (L \u00d7 W). To reduce interference during electrical measurements, the device was passivated with SU8-2010. Details of the fabrication of the COVID-19 FET sensor is provided in Materials and Methods. To confirm that the graphene surface was chemically functionalized using PBASE, we obtained Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data ( Figure 2B \u2212H). Figure 2B shows the Raman spectra of the pristine and PBASE-modified graphene surfaces. In the spectrum for the surface of pristine graphene, two major peaks (the G and 2D peaks) were observed. The G peak corresponds to the lattice vibration mode, and the 2D peak stems from second-order Raman scattering. However, the D and D\u2032 peaks obviously appeared due to the relative resonance of sp 3 bonding, orbital hybridization, and a pyrene group in the binding of PABSE to the graphene surface. To provide a visual comparison of the qualities of graphene after modification with PBASE, we converted the measured data to histograms and mapping images ( Figure 2C \u2212E). After PBASE was applied to the graphene surface, the statistical data of the 2D peak position were shifted to a higher frequency (\u223c3.27 cm \u22121 ), indicating p-doping by the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 interaction between PBASE and graphene ( Figure 2C ). 23, 24 The mapping images also show that the average I 2D /I G ratio of PBASE-treated graphene (I 2D /I G = \u223c1.87) is significantly lower than that of pristine graphene (I 2D /I G = \u223c3.61) due to existence of some disorder on the graphene ( Figure 2D ,E).",

To this end, we collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients and normal subjects and stored them in UTM. Prior to addition of patient samples to the device, we evaluated nasopharyngeal swab samples from normal subjects to determine the basal signal. The COVID-19 FET sensor clearly discriminated between patient and normal samples ( Figure 6B,C) . In addition, the FET sensor responded to patient samples diluted as much as 1:1 \u00d7 10 5 (242 copies/mL) ( Figure 6D) , and the normalized response curve of the FET sensor was linear ( Figure 6E ). Given that UTM includes various reagents and generates noise signals, we consider the LOD of the COVID-19 FET sensor to be low enough for practical use Table S2 . Nevertheless, development of novel materials of the FET sensor for UTM should be necessary for more accurate detection by reducing the noise signals. For reference, the detection limit of current molecular diagnostic tests of COVID-19 is \u223c50\u2212100 copies. 28 Taken together, our findings show that our COVID-19 FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 virus from clinical samples without any preprocessing and with a large dynamic range.",

Furthermore, the device exhibited no measurable cross-reactivity with MERS-CoV antigen.
