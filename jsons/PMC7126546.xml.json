The Medical Council of Canada administers national licensing exams, similar to the National Board of Medical Examiners in the U.S. The MCCQE1 is normally taken at the end of the fourth year of medical school and has six major components, one of which is the PHELO component. Prior to 2001, the PHELO component was known as Population Health (PH; in 2000) and as Preventive Medicine and Community Health (PMCH) before 2000. In order to compare the different curricular methods (didactic portion in the second year; Health, Illness, and the Community/Determinants of Health; and DOCH), the changes in ranking of the U of T (relative to the other 16 medical schools) in the PHELO/Public Health/Preventive Medicine and Community Health scores were compared over time. In this approach, a lower ranking is better. In order to compare the trend over time, Mann\u2013Whitney/Wilcoxon 2 Sample Rank Sum (Kruskal\u2013Wallis) test12 was analyzed in Epiinfo.13 This method compared the time periods of 1996\u20132002 and 2003\u20132009.",

On the other hand, similar sessions on public health where students visit a school and assess the health of a population of school children are slightly lower (Table 3). Overall, lectures delivered by patients or members of the community (e.g., a drug addict presenting on the heroin replacement program) had the highest ratings, followed by community visits.

The total number of educational hours offered in the Health, Illness, and the Community/Determinants of Health curriculum was the same as that of the DOCH curriculum. The essential difference was the organization of the material into a longitudinal curriculum and a change in the timing of the course (moving 1 week from the third year to the fourth year of the curriculum). The other comparison is between U of T and the other medical schools. During this time, no other Canadian medical school used a longitudinal curriculum.

There was one overall course planning committee and one course director who was responsible for the curriculum planning and delivery of all 4 years. The course planning committee had student representatives from all 4 years. Since many curricular topics have a community health component, there has been a strong pressure to keep adding more and more topics to the DOCH course, particularly those that did not fit well with the other courses being offered. The spiral curriculum provided a framework for assessing these potential new components relative to the student learning objectives. In many instances, the new components were rejected or moved to another time due to this incompatibility. For example, the suggestion of teaching how to interview patients with disabilities living in the community was felt to fit with the clinical skills course. The inclusion of such material would have lead to potential confusion among the students about the core content of public health.",

The examples shown in Table 3 were chosen as they were typical of the student evaluations over the years. As can be seen, the first-year community field visits ranked extremely high. On the other hand, the values for the second year were lower. The latter were interpreted to be due to the fact that the lectures on research methodology were general in nature and the students had to apply material to their individual project. Based on these evaluation scores, more relevant speakers were identified and other educational resources were developed, such as web-based modules to help students with specific educational needs (e.g., many students conduct surveys, so a module on survey research was added). A second reason for the lower scores is that second-year students have to take an active role in engaging with the sponsoring agencies to complete their projects.",
