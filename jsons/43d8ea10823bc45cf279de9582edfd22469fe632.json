            "text": "Using the persecution of Muslims in India that is currently taking place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 global pandemic as an illustrative case, this essay identifies the dynamics of the organization of ideological discourse by populist leaders in times of unexpected crisis. The organization of ideological discourse represents strategic, discursive acts committed by populist leaders aimed at foregrounding social conditions that would function in the advancement of various political ends-whether those ends may be the consolidation of power, the undermining of institutional systems of checks and balances, the implementation of exclusionary or injurious policies against disenfranchised constituents, the suspension of civil liberties, or a combination thereof. It is engendered through a three-stage process. In the first stage, surface-level validation by legitimate institutional actors confirms preconceived ideas about a constructed enemy. In the second stage, inflammatory rhetoric is deployed by populist leaders, which scapegoat that constructed enemy. These two stages culminate to create widespread moral panic in society. With moral panic firmly established, in the third stage an environment of fear and paranoia becomes susceptible to the enactment of symbolic and physical violence against the constructed enemy. The essay concludes with some words on the pressing need to deconstruct ideologically motivated discourses related to COVID-19.",

The effective appropriation of COVID-19 for political purposes generated a moral panic so intense that merely being Muslim qualified someone to being subjected to communal violence. What is perhaps most alarming, and poignant, is the fact that in all of the cases the Hindu assailants were not strangers to the Muslim victims. The beating experienced by Ali, the stigmatization felt by Muhamud, and the physical and sexual assault encountered by Khan, were committed by their respective neighbors-people whom the victims lived alongside for years. This speaks to the insidiousness with which the organization of ideological discourse functions. The ideological discourse is crafted in such a way that it casts the constructed enemy to be a ubiquitous and an existential threat. The perceived ubiquitous nature of the constructed enemy ensures that fear and paranoia dictate the actions of otherwise peaceful neighbors. Fear and paranoia are evident in hearing demands from ordinary citizens who have turned violent to know the enemy's \"plan to spread corona\" or xenophobic calls to \"go back to Pakistan.\" In sum, once the constructed enemy becomes reified in the minds of citizens, ideologues step back and watch their ideology come to fruition; all too often without having to engage in its direct execution.",

The organization of ideological discourse is engendered through a three-stage process. In the first stage, surface-level validation by legitimate institutional actors confirms preconceived ideas about a constructed enemy. In the second stage, inflammatory rhetoric is deployed by populist leaders, which scapegoat that constructed enemy. These two stages culminate to create widespread moral panic in society. With moral panic firmly established, in the third stage an environment of fear and paranoia becomes susceptible to the enactment of symbolic and physical violence against the constructed enemy.",

Indeed, much akin to how Kristallnacht was not the source of antisemitism in the Nazi ideology, so too did COVID-19 not cause Islamophobia in the BJP's Hindutva ideology. On the contrary, each of these unexpected crises were exploited by populist leaders to justify, as well as to expedite, the very religious persecution that their ideologies always desired. COVID-19, in the case of the BJP, gave its leaders the license to continue to chart the course, though now only quicker, towards the ideological project that it always possessed-a motherland based on Hindu culture and values (and without Muslims).",

At present, much energy has been preoccupied with reorganizing personal and professional lives in the era of social distancing. Most individuals' social realities have been fundamentally changed; and time and attention, understandably so, have been directed towards acclimating to the changes. Because of COVID-19, we are in the process of creating new ways of living and alternative ways of relating. Even those branches of society that are charged with tackling COVID-19 directly-involving certain members in media, healthcare, academia, industry, state bureaucracy, nongovernmental organizations-have mainly attended to the more technical aspects of the virus, answering important questions like how best to contain it or how to cope with its medical or economic effects. While undoubtedly these were (and remain) important questions, preoccupation with such issues has engendered an inadvertent consequence. It has caused a dangerous form of societal tunnel vision, preventing critical examination on how the very discourses over COVID-19 are being discretely packaged to accomplish problematic ideological aims. COVID-19 has proffered populist leaders around the world with the necessary cover to advance hateful ideologies that often call for violence against constructed enemies. Because this phenomenon has materialized in the shadows of the politically neutral reality of COVID-19, such ideologies have neither encountered meaningful critique nor objection.",

The anti-Muslim tenor that clandestinely foregrounds Hindutva, when it is cloaked in the concerns over the management of COVID-19, is obfuscated. Of course, it is not only countries in the Global South that are using COVID-19 to achieve political ends; as, for instance, the unsettling crackdown by Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, on basic democratic principles such as a free press and free and open elections has shown. Indeed, populist leaders in the Global South and the Global North adopt a very similar playbook to ascertain and maintain power (Masood and Nisar, 2020) . For this reason, it would not take too great a leap of faith to imagine scenarios in which, for example, Donald Trump invokes COVID-19 in attempts to suspend the presidential election slated for later this year or, otherwise, has members of his republican party use the pandemic to further engage in acts of voter suppression in efforts to guarantee his second term in office.",

Citizens have the responsibility to decipher between truth and false, real and imagined, and fact and fiction (Prasad, 2019) . As the effects of COVID-19 unfolds, it is crucial for citizens to be wary of the discourses about the disease coming from political leaders. Leaders who make truth-claims that are not substantiated by evidence-based science ought to be received with suspicion-repudiated when necessary. While the effects of COVID-19 are very much real-at the time of writing, 3.6 million individuals have been infected with the virus and more than 250,000 lives have succumbed to it-some of what political leaders have had to say about the disease is questionable, distorted, or purposefully deceptive. If we are to take seriously George Santayana's words that I quoted to introduce this essay, we ought to keep remembrance of the lessons from the Night of the Broken Glass as we try to navigate this truly global pandemic.",

This assertion is not to suggest the Hindutva has not previously been associated with violent acts.Indeed, Hindutva has a long history of both directly and indirectly engendering violence against non-Hindus, and especially Muslims. A case in point was the 2002 communal riots in the state of Gujarat, which claimed the lives of over 1000 people. The communal riots occurred during a time when Modi was the Chief Minister of the state. Given Modi's-and the BJP's-adherence to Hindutva, it is not surprising that he, at the very least, tacitly sanctioned the communal violence against Muslims (Masood and Nisar, 2020) . So, while the ideology of Hindutva is ontologically violent, the point being offered here is that COVID-19 has allowed for ideologues to issue incendiary statements that have only intensified violence against Muslims in terms of degree and frequency.",
