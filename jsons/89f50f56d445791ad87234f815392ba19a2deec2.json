It was first described in 2019, developed into an epidemic in January 2020 and has spread the global to the present COVID-19 pandemic. It spreads mainly through droplet infection. On surfaces, virus particles remain infectious for hours to days, so that they can reach the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose from keyboards, tables, door handles and handles via the hands(lubricating infection). Infection via the conjunctiva of the eye is also possible [1, 2] .",

Damage to the lung results in activation of the immune system, which not only leads to the release of several proinflammatory proteins and neutrophilic influx into the alveolar space but also leads to the local biosynthesis of pro-resolution lipids mediators, such as lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins. [13] . Along these lines, Cilloniz et al. [14] If the beneficial actions of these mediators translate from pre-clinical studies into human clinical trials, they represent promising new strategies in the management of infectious disease. The proresolution, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial-enhancing actions of SPM such as the resolvins, protectin and potentially maresins make these appealing candidates for further study in humans and specifically in COVID19 patients. From a therapeutic perspective it is important to note that these pro-resolution mediators have a substantial advantage over steroids for use in the treatment of infectious inflammation, or other systemic inflammatory states, as they are not immunosuppressive agents. Acetylsalicylic acid-triggered lipoxins and resolvins epimers share these pro-resolution actions and act by the same intracellular pathways. [15, 16] . This effect is unique to aspirin, and is not shared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which do not trigger the endogenous biosynthesis of these mediators.",

They found that extra-pulmonary dissemination was associated with down-regulation of genes involved in mediating the pro-resolution impact of lipoxin on leucocyte recruitment and counter-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine induction and that loss of lipoxin's pro-resolution actions may be associated with greater influenza A virus virulence. These findings suggest a protective role for SPM in this infection, possibly related to the reduction and counter-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are up-regulated during viral infections.",
