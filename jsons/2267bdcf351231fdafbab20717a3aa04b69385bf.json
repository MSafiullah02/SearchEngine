We also made a large scale meta-analysis of 1646 cases combined with 4 related literatures, and further confirmed the relationship between the COVID-19 severity and these risk factors. Moreover, we tracked dynamic changes during the process of COVID-19, and found CRP, D-dimer, LDH, PCT kept in high levels in severe patient. Among all these markers, D-dimer increased remarkably in severe patients and mostly related with the case-fatality rate (CFR). We found adjuvant antithrombotic treatment in some severe patients achieved good therapeutic effect in the cohort.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection broke out in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China. As of April 18th, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) reported 2,160,207 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in most countries or areas, and 146,088 people died from COVID-19(1). The overall COVID-19 case-fatality rate (CFR) has approached about 4%. Human to human transmission has accounted for most if not all of the COVID-19 infections, including the medical personnel in hospital (2, 3) . The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included fever, cough, diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue and pneumonia (4) (5) (6) . Most patients with COVID-19 were considered as non-severe patients and the symptoms generally mild. However, the symptoms in about 10% of COVID-19 patients are severe and some progress rapidly to critical conditions, including organ dysfunction, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury and even death (7, 8) . So far, there is no specific medicine or effective vaccines for COVID-19, and the diagnosis methods for the severity of COVID-19 patients were limited. Thus, our objective of this cohort is to explore the risk factors which related with the severity of COVID-19 and put it into practice. In addition, we used meta-analysis to verify these risk factors. Our study would be helpful for setting up different treatment and personal therapy route for COVID-19 patients.",

The age differed significantly between the two subgroups, and 44.8% of severe patients were aged above 60 years. Men are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 than women (66.3% vs. 33.7%). Fever (78.9%), cough (67.7%) and fatigue (56.5) were the most common symptoms, whereas diarrhea (6.7%) was rare. Notably, fever occurred more frequently in the patients in the severe group than the non-severe group (85.7% vs.73.6%). We also found the comorbidities were risk factors associated withe the severity of COVID-19 in our cohort. More severe patients had common chronic diseases than non-severe patients, such as hypertension (38.8% vs. 9.6%) and diabetes (12.2% vs. 5.6%).",

Of the risk factors evaluated, we found the levels of D-dimer, CRP, LDH, and PCT are significantly higher in severe patients than in non-severe patients (Figure3) . Moreover, we found that, while levels of CRP, LDH, and PCT were consistently high in severe patient, D-dimer level still increased in some severe patients, which means it was most likely related to severity (Figure3). Strikingly, when further stratified the severe patient into two subgroups: Recovered (R-severe, 31 cases) and Death (D-severe, 67 cases), we found D-dimer kept increasing in D-severe group but dropped in the R-severe group after 10 days from the admission onset, and the levels of D-Dimer in these two subgroups were significantly different (14.33 vs. 1.65, P<0.001) after 15 days from the admission onset. These results suggested D-dimer might be more related with the CFR compared with other markers. In addition, we checked the case reports of COVID-19 patients and found that D-dimer was also related with the status of patients, and preventive and adjuvant antithrombotic treatment in some severe patients achieved good therapeutic effect (the representative chest X ray images were shown as Figure 4 ).",

For the diagnosis markers, we found the D-dimer, CRP, LDH, PCT were increased quickly in severe group compared with the non-severe group (CRP, 65.1% vs. 13 , while ASP, ALP, CK and creatinine were mildly increased. This means more inflammation, thrombus, myocardial injury or liver and kidney damage existed in severe patients. In addition, we made a meta-analysis of 1646 cases with additional 4 related studies to further confirm the risk factors. Moreover, we studied the dynamic changes during the process of COVID-19 by timeline tracking. We found CRP, D-dimer, LDH, PCT kept in higher levels in severe patients. Notably, D-dimer still increased quickly in some severe patients and most likely related with the CFR than other markers. It is noticed that another recent cohort study also showed that D-dimer is a critical risk factors for the CFR of COVID-19 (15) .We checked the case reports of severe patients in our cohort retrospectively, and found that prophylactic antithrombotic therapy effectively improved the prognosis in some patients. Thus, we propose that severe patients of COVID-19 can be given preventive anticoagulants or physical therapy. Indeed, when there is serious hypoxemia and hypotension, the possibility of embolism should be considered, and thrombolysis should be timely in the absence of thrombolysis contraindication.",

Laboratory assessments consisted of complete blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Radiologic assessments included chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT). The severity of COVID-19 was defined based on the international guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (14) .
