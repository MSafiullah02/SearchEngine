However, disruption of M pro cleavage during any stage of the infection cycle blocks replication, suggesting that constitutive proteolytic processing of the nonstructural polyprotein is a requirement for efficient transcription. 5 In this report, we describe preliminary data defining the requirement for the proteolytic processing of the nsp7-nsp10 proteins in MHV-A59 replication. Through use of an efficient MHV-A59 reverse genetics system, 6 we ablated each of the M pro cleavage sites associated with the nsp7-nsp10 cassette, and evaluated whether the mutated genome was capable of supporting a viable virus, and if so, characterized the M pro processing of the mutated protein, transcription function, and in vitro growth fitness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 190, "end": 193, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 194, "end": 197, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 202, "end": 205, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 527, "end": 528, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 742, "end": 743, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The M pro targets amino acid sequences Q-S/N/A, cleaving after the essential Glu at position 1 (P1). 7 To evaluate the importance of cleavage on virus replication, the cleavage sites flanking nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, and nsp10 were individually disrupted by mutating the P1 Glu to an Ala (Table 1) . However, there are two potential M pro cleavage sites at the nsp7/8 interface, an LQA (present at positions P5-P3) and LQS (P2-P1').

Bands corresponding to nsp10 (15-kDa protein) were absent in lysates of MHV-nsp9*10 and MHV-nsp9*10p15. However, a band of approximately 37 kDa, which is the predicted size for uncleaved nsp9-nsp10, was present in the mutants, but absent in the wild-type control cells. Analysis of the i.p.-Western blot suggested that MHV-A59 was able to use either of the two potential M pro cleavage sites located at the nsp7/nsp8 site, likely accounting for the wild-type growth kinetics. Bands of approximately 22 kDa were precipitated with anti-nsp8 antibody for the wild-type control, MHV-nsp7*8.A, and MHV-nsp7*8.B.

Cells infected with either MHV-A59, mock, or mutant virus were dual-stained for either nsp8 or nsp10 (depending on the mutant, as above) and nucleocapsid (N), which co-localizes with sites of active viral replication, or membrane (M), which is targeted to regions of virus assembly.

Lethality could be due to disruption of nsp7-10 proteolytic processing causing a failure of precursor, intermediate, or mature protein function within the replication complex. However, not all of the M pro cleavage site mutants were nonviable. Based on the genetic analysis, MHV-A59 has two functional nsp7-nsp8 M pro cleavage sites, LQA and LQS, and disruption of either of these potential sites fails to affect replication competence, M pro cleavage pattern, or cellular localization in vitro. Possible in vivo effects need to be studied. In contrast, simultaneous mutation of both sites was lethal. The only other M pro cleavage site harboring a viable mutation was that shared by the nsp9 and nsp10 proteins. In this case, the mutant virus was highly attenuated in its replication efficiency and was unable to proteolytically process the fused nsp9-nsp10 protein. Serial passage of this virus restored wild-type replication but did so without reverting the mutated cleavage site or the ability to process the nsp9-nsp10 protein.
