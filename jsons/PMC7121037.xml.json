Reminiscent of roles played by their evolutionary counterparts in primitive organisms (Delvaeye and Conway 2009), it is now well-established that platelets directly modulate cells of the immune system through receptor-mediated cell contact with leukocytes and pathogens. In combination with these interactions, external stimuli induce secretion of cytokines and other cell modulators from platelet \u03b1-granules and dense granules to produce additional indirect effects on the cellular immune response. Moreover, in contrast to the bygone paradigms, the platelet proteome is not static. Platelets inherit from antecedent megakaryocytes a repertoire of mRNAs and the necessary post-transcriptional machinery to alter their protein composition (Schubert et al. 2014). Platelets survey their local environment, reacting dynamically to change, and are thus pivotally positioned during the defense against pathogens (Semple et al. 2011). Here, we focus on their complex interactions with viruses.",

In some cases, these highlight the effects of specific virus types (Chabert et al. 2015; Hottz et al. 2011), whereas others are more general (Assinger et al. 2014; Zapata et al. 2014). The ultimate message is that viruses trigger a complexity of biochemical and cellular events, often resulting in diminished platelet count, altered vascular permeability, and consequent bleeding diathesis. In this review, we revisit these ideas and add a temporal aspect to the emerging model. We speculate that platelets are more than immune modulators and \u201cinnocent\u201d bystanders in the host response to viral infection and that, in the case of viruses with an RNA genome, platelets initially participate as a viral ally.",

            "text": "When a foreign particle, such as a virus, binds directly to the platelet surface, it is reasonable to speculate that consequent immune recognition leads to a reduction in platelet count. Thus, virus-induced thrombocytopenia has been the rationale for investigating interactions between viruses and platelets. Table 1 lists viruses that correlate with thrombocytopenia without HF. Representing at least six virus families, these viruses range broadly in structure and genome organization and, with the exception of adenoviruses, are surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope that contains both host cell- and virus-derived elements. Therefore, an adaptive immune response as a result of viral infection of platelets may involve both virus antigens and co-epitopes originating from virus and host factors, resulting in a reduced platelet count. Receptors on the platelet that associate with viruses have been identified and include integrins \u03b15\u03b21, \u03b1IIb\u03b23, and \u03b15\u03b23; the lectin, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grapping non-integrin (DC-SIGN); Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4; coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR); complement receptor 2 (CR2); C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4); C-type lectin domain family 2 (CLEC-2); chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL); and glycoprotein (GP) VI. Co-receptor systems involving more than one virus\u2013platelet interaction may also exist, as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In some cases, the platelet receptor is unknown (e.g., SARS-CoV).\n",

Early inhibition studies involving adenovirus used purified matrix proteins, adenovirus penton base proteins, and synthetic peptides. Results suggested the importance of the \u03b15 and \u03b21/\u03b23 integrins for infection of several cell lines (Stevenson et al. 1997; Wickham et al. 1993). Immuno- and electron microscopy studies have shown that platelet \u03b1IIb\u03b23 is also important for the binding of adenovirus (Gupalo et al. 2013). Further cellular studies implicated CAR (Bergelson et al. 1997) in the virus\u2013platelet association and identified this receptor on platelets by flow cytometry and RNA isolation (Othman et al. 2007). Additional studies using immuno-inhibition and arginyl\u2013glycyl\u2013aspartyl (RGD) motif peptide mimics confirmed the importance of \u03b15 integrins in adenovirus binding to platelets; however, they failed to detect CAR expression (Shimony et al. 2009).",

Making vaccine development difficult, some secondary viral infection mechanisms exploit antibody-dependent enhancement; examples are dengue virus (DENV) and HIV (Guzman et al. 2013). Although antibody-bridged binding to platelets has not been specifically documented for many viruses, it is reasonable to speculate that such viral immune complexes commonly form interactions with platelets. Similar to engagement of other receptors on the platelet surface, these multivalent adducts could crosslink the Fc\u03b3RIIA, causing platelet activation.",

HF is characterized by the loss of blood homeostasis, leading to increased vascular permeability and bleeding, which can progress to shock. The causative agents of viral HF are enveloped RNA viruses from four families: Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Arenaviridae, and Filoviridae (Table 2). These families contain well-known species such as Ebola and DENV that are featured as \u201cheadline news\u201d because of the devastating and graphic illnesses these epidemic pathogens can cause. Some of the viruses are especially difficult to experimentally manipulate because of their biohazard classification level and, consequently, relatively little is known about their biochemistry. Nevertheless, receptors for viruses known to cause viral HF have been identified. Interestingly, these are similar to those receptors characterized for viruses as predominantly thrombocytopenic: \u03b21/\u03b23 integrins, lectins, and TLRs. Therefore, it is not surprising that HF viruses can also result in thrombocytopenia.\n",

Whether these are the same type of receptor is unknown. Employing a transduced cell model of infection, DC-SIGN has also been shown to be involved as a receptor in Ebola virus infection (Alvarez et al. 2002). Mutagenesis, binding, and RNA interference experiments have implicated Axl (Shimojima et al. 2007) and Tyro3 (Hunt et al. 2011) in Ebola\u2019s complex cell engagement mechanism. These observations suggest that multiple receptors are occupied in the Ebola\u2013platelet interaction. Interestingly, similar platelet surface molecules may bind Lassa virus, as indicated by the identification of DC-SIGN, Axl, and Tyro3 as receptors using cell binding and infection assays (Shimojima et al. 2012). In addition, the results of immunoblot and competition assays involving purified virus suggested that \u03b1-dystroglycan is a Lassa virus receptor (Cao et al. 1998). Neutralizing antibody experiments have implicated \u03b23 integrins in the interaction between cells infected with hantavirus and platelets (Gavrilovskaya et al. 1999; Gavrilovskaya et al. 2010). Although cell and platelet receptors remain elusive for some HF viruses, it is possible that a particular receptor may function across an individual virus family.",

Predominately from the Picornaviridae family, these non-enveloped RNA viruses cause enteric, throat, and nasal infections. Although not directly confirmed as analogous functional receptors for picornavirus on platelets, \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrins are known to facilitate interactions with receptors on other cell types. Studies following surface expression of mutated proteins in CHO cells and antibody inhibition studies have identified integrin \u03b12\u03b21 as a binding partner for both rotavirus and echovirus (Coulson et al. 1997; Fleming et al. 2011). Utilizing an antigenic inhibition model and CHO transfection, members of the \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrin families were shown to mediate parechovirus infection (Triantafilou et al. 2000). This suggests the potential for binding recognition with the integrin known to be expressed on the platelet surface. It is somewhat puzzling that thrombocytopenia is not induced because engagement of these receptors by other viruses is consistent with this outcome. Consequently, integrins may not be the only common denominator resulting in this virus-mediated hemostatic disorder.",

It is clear that protein and carbohydrate receptors on the surface of platelets bind viruses from many distinct families (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Indeed, it is not surprising that the interactions known to exist between viruses and platelet receptors can facilitate platelet activation. Interactions with DENV grown in culture have been shown to induce platelet shape changes, as monitored by atomic force and electron microscopy (Ghosh et al. 2008). DENV has also been demonstrated to cause the exposure of P-selectin and procoagulant phospholipid on the platelet surface (Hottz et al. 2013b; Simon et al. 2015), and to initiate apoptosis-like markers, including caspase activation and mitochondrial permeability changes (Hottz et al. 2013b), Similarly, HIV can induce microparticle release and other hallmarks of platelet activation (Wang et al. 2011) that are related to plasma virus levels (Mayne et al. 2012). Differential response to platelet agonists in HIV-infected individuals points to functional changes in platelets, with implications for thrombosis (Satchell et al. 2010). Interestingly, additional studies further implicated HIV treatment strategies in the development of hyper-responsive platelets (Falcinelli et al. 2013; Gresele et al. 2012). Although the direct effect of virus binding on platelet activation has not been studied extensively, outside-in signal-induced platelet changes are probably a general characteristic, regardless of the type of virus.\n",

The second step in the virus lifecycle is cell entry. Two general mechanisms of cell entry can be initiated upon contact between an animal virus and a target host cell. Most viruses traverse the plasma membrane using the endocytic machinery intrinsic to the cell, whereby the virus is engulfed by a vesicular structure for intracellular transport (Ghigo 2010). Within these endosomal compartments, low pH typically induces the release of genetic contents from the viral nucleocapsid. Based on microscopic morphology and biochemistry, nearly a dozen viral endocytosis mechanisms have been discerned (Cossart and Helenius 2014; Mercer et al. 2010). A second entry mechanism is used exclusively by enveloped viruses. After receptor-mediated cell surface binding, both virus- and host-encoded (Derry et al. 2007) proteins on the virus envelope can engage to form a conformational fusion complex that merges the envelope and plasma membrane.",

Another entry mechanism was suggested by colocalization of purified adenovirus with the surface-connected channels of the platelet open canalicular system (Stone et al. 2007). Purified IAV and platelets enabled observation by electron microscopy of the surface association and uptake of virus-like particles into vacuolar structures (Danon et al. 1959). Furthermore, virus-like particles have been reported in the platelets of DENV-infected patients, although these difficult experiments lacked confirmation of virus (Noisakran et al. 2009). Electron microscopy has also been used to demonstrate encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) uptake by platelets in a murine model of infection (Koupenova et al. 2014). To confirm their endocytic capabilities, purified platelets have been shown to engulf Staphylococcus aureus (Youssefian et al. 2002) and liposomes that were engineered for drug delivery (Chan et al. 2015). Although viral entry mechanisms are not known, molecular details following the transfer of synthetic particles into platelets suggests that several simultaneous endocytotic pathways are involved (Chan et al. 2015). These pathways may have dynamin dependence as a common aspect and involve caveolae- or clathrin-mediated uptake (Mercer et al. 2010). Thus, observations of virus uptake by platelets are supported by the availability of entry mechanisms for other particle types.",

Assuming successful entry and release of genetic material into the platelet, only RNA viruses replicate because platelets are DNA transcription incompetent. The list of RNA viruses with known or suspected platelet interactions is extensive and highlighted in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Platelets contain all of the post-transcriptional apparatus necessary for potential assembly of an infectious RNA virus. To demonstrate that platelets can translate viral RNA, purified platelets inoculated with purified DENV have been shown to produce viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), as detected by Western blot analysis (Simon et al. 2015). Because the DENV single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) must first be translated as a polyprotein, the finding that NS1 had the predicted molecular weight of the mature protein implied that the functional DENV protease complex (NS2B/NS3) was also properly translated and processed by the platelets (Simon et al. 2015). Thus, platelets not only facilitate the initial step in the virus lifecycle, specific surface engagement (Tables 1, 2, and 3), but also have the means to allow penetration of the virus into the cytoplasm and occupation of the platelet translational mechanism.",

In these studies, the mRNAs of all four serotypes of purified DENV in combination with purified platelets were enhanced (Simon et al. 2015), which substantiated an earlier preliminary report (Onlamoon et al. 2010). These studies were extended using virus plaque formation assays in combination with a translation inhibitor and demonstrated that the virus is properly assembled, resulting in production of infectious progeny by platelets (Simon et al. 2015). Interestingly, platelet units stored under blood bank operating conditions also produced new DENV (Sutherland et al. 2016). A generalized model is presented in Fig. 1, highlighting the emerging concept that platelets could be a reservoir for permissive RNA viruses. The concept is based on (1) significant literature demonstrating that many types of virus bind directly to platelets; (2) several studies showing platelet entry; and (3) generation of infectious DENV progeny by platelets.\n",

Furthermore, TLR2 is found on a subset of ~14 % of platelets and is involved in at least the CMV interaction (Boehme et al. 2006). Some platelet-interacting viruses are known to use co-receptor systems, of which candidate receptors are found on platelets.

Known to recognize ssRNA, typical of many platelet-interacting viruses (Tables 1, 2, and 3), platelet TLR7 was identified as vital for EMCV clearance by platelets (Koupenova et al. 2014). Interestingly, this receptor is expressed within endosomes and its functional involvement implies endocytosis of the virus by the platelet. Penetrance of EMCV was TLR7 dependent, with activation of TLR7 resulting in the release of the \u03b1-granules that house proinflammatory cytokines, leading to neutrophil aggregation, endothelial cell adhesion, and inflammation. The TLR7 platelet response was shown to contribute to host survival, as EMCV levels decreased and there were no observable prothrombotic events as a consequence of potential platelet activation (Koupenova et al. 2014).",

Vascular endothelial-derived growth factor (VEGF) is a proangiogenic cytokine that is released by TLR2-induced platelet activation and involved in endothelial migration, proliferation, and increased vascular permeability (Assinger et al. 2014). To add further to the many links reported between CMV and vascular disease (Al-Ghamdi 2012; Bruggeman 2000), this TLR2-mediated VEGF release can allow leukocyte recruitment to an atherosclerotic plaque, promoting growth (Holm et al. 2009).",

In addition to the role of integrins in facilitating numerous direct platelet\u2013virus interactions (Tables 1, 2, and 3), they are also important in processes leading to immune clearance of blood-borne viruses. One example is through the recruitment of dendritic cells by the interaction of platelet surface junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C) and dendritic cell integrin \u03b1M\u03b22 (Langer et al. 2007). Trafficking of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to sites of infection can be mediated by platelet activation (Iannacone et al. 2005). In the case of hepatitis B virus (HBV), CTLs enter the liver parenchyma and accumulate where HBV may reside and replicate. CTL activity lowers the virus count, but unfortunately contributes to progression of liver damage (Iannacone et al. 2005).",

This involvement of integrins was unambiguously demonstrated using a \u03b23 knockout mouse model (Wang et al. 2011). Virus-induced platelet degranulation involves the release of proinflammatory CD40 ligand, which promotes platelet\u2013monocyte complex formation via platelet P-selectin and monocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (Singh et al. 2014). This was demonstrated by injecting wild-type mice with recombinant soluble CD40 ligand and analyzing cell associations by flow cytometry.

In response to stimulus-induced activation, P-selectin is transported to the platelet surface where it mediates tethering to numerous cell types. Important to the role of platelets in orchestrating the immune response, platelet surface P-selectin mediates adhesion through association with PSGL-1 found on the neutrophil surface. P-selectin on platelets also interacts with PSGL-1 on a subset of Th1 leukocytes. Thus, when binding of viruses to the platelet surface triggers platelet activation and P-selectin expression on the surface, innate immune clearance of the pathogen is facilitated.",

HIV-1 induced hBD-2 and hBD-3 expression in human oral epithelial cells, which associated directly with HIV-1 and neutralized infection in vitro (Quinones-Mateu et al. 2003). IAV hemagglutinin and hBD-3 binding also resulted in inhibition of epithelial cell infection (Leikina et al. 2005). hBD-3 was shown to alter fusion between IAV, sindbis virus, baculovirus, and synthetic target membrane by crosslinking virus surface proteins (Leikina et al. 2005).

However, dense granule constituents such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (Packham and Rand 2011), polyphosphates (polyP) (Smith and Morrissey 2014), and serotonin (Jedlitschky et al. 2012) also have immune-modulating properties (Morrell et al. 2014). These have not been as well characterized for a role in viral innate immunity as those contained in \u03b1-granules. Nevertheless, the release of platelet dense granule contents by viruses has been investigated in CMV infection. This was mediated by platelet surface TLR2 occupation. Furthermore, inhibition of the ADP receptor, P2Y12, identified ADP release as an important trigger for secondary platelet activation (Assinger et al. 2014). Dendritic cells also express P2Y12 and their stimulation increases antigen endocytosis and processing (Vanderstocken et al. 2010), which could involve localized platelet response to pathogen interactions. PolyP induces proinflammatory responses by acting on the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway in vascular endothelial cells (Bae et al. 2012). PolyP can also interact with chromatin-associated nuclear proteins such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) to amplify proinflammatory responses (Dinarvand et al. 2014). Because HMGB1 is also secreted by platelets (Maugeri et al. 2012), polyP warrants continued study as a bridge between platelets and innate immunity, especially in the context of complement, which is suppressed by polyP (Wat et al. 2014) and could be a viral survival mechanism.",

An increase in cell death via apoptosis and decreased megakaryocyte differentiation are probable reasons for reduced platelet production. For example, HIV infection of megakaryocytes resulted in downregulation of the TPO receptor c-Mpl (Gibellini et al. 2013), causing reduced sensitivity to thrombopoeisis induction. To further investigate this mechanism, umbilical cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells that were induced by TPO toward a megakaryocytic lineage in vitro have been used as a model for HIV infection. The virus surface glycoprotein gp120 interacts with CD4 on these cells (Gibellini et al. 2007), resulting in specific protein and mRNA changes that elevate TGF-\u03b21 levels and decrease tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 13 (TNFSF13) levels. Both of these effects contribute to inhibition of megakaryocytic proliferation and promote apoptosis (Gibellini et al. 2007). Further evidence supporting the concept that viral thrombocytopenia involves attenuated thrombopoiesis comes from an elegant humanized mouse model showing that DENV infection reduces platelet production (Sridharan et al. 2013). Thus, viral infection has the capacity to reduce thrombopoeisis by direct effects on the megakaryocyte, conceivably involving the same surface receptors for specific viruses that have been identified on platelets and other cells (Tables 1, 2, and 3).",

The interaction of hantavirus with platelets also contributed to viral dissemination and activation of endothelial cell functions, thereby increasing vascular permeability (Feldmann and Geisbert 2011; Gavrilovskaya et al. 2010).",

In addition to PAR-1 activation by thrombin, IAV can activate platelets through low-affinity Fc\u03b3RIIA signaling (Boilard et al. 2014). For this to occur, IAV must be decorated with anti-IAV IgG. Crossreactive antibodies resulting from immune recognition of different IAV strains (H1N1 versus H3N2) was sufficient to produce this effect. When wild-type mice (which do not express Fc\u03b3RIIA) and transgenic mice expressing human Fc\u03b3RIIA were challenged intravenously with a sublethal dose of H1N1, there was a drop in circulating platelet count in only the transgenic mice.

Adenovirus induced thrombocytopenia in wild-type animals but, in sharp contrast, vWF knockout mice were protected from a reduced platelet count (Gupalo et al. 2011). Thus, endothelial vWF could contribute in an indirect manner to virus-induced thrombocytopenia by supporting platelet aggregation through interactions with platelet surface GP1b, (the vWF receptor).

Other HF viruses such as Lassa virus, Junin virus, and Ebola virus have inhibitors of platelet aggregation, but these have not been identified (Cummins et al. 1989; Cummins et al. 1990, Feldmann and Klenk 1996). Additionally, vaccinia virus causes impairment of platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, or thrombin (Bik et al. 1982).

Affinity purification of circulating serum immune complexes in HIV patients identified an anti-HIV IgG1 antibody that recognizes amino acid residues 49\u201366 of the integrin \u03b23 subunit that induces platelet vessiculation (Nardi et al. 2001). The complement pathway was ruled out in this reaction because neither the F(ab\u2032)2 fragment of the antibody raised against integrin \u03b23 residues 49\u201366 in wild-type mice nor treatment with full-length antibody in C3-deficient mice could affect platelet microparticle formation (Nardi et al. 2001). Peroxide generation was monitored through the use of an intracellular fluorescent probe and revealed a novel mechanism by which the autoantibody induced damage in platelets through a NADPH oxidase peroxide-generating pathway (Nardi et al. 2001). Similar outside-in signaling events could be generated by other virus-induced platelet autoantibodies.",

The crossreactivity was found by using the antibody specific for integrin \u03b23 residues 49\u201366 to screen a phage-display peptide library (Zhang et al. 2009). The recognized peptides were then aligned with the viral genome to define similarities. The matched peptides were rationally designed as tools to inhibit the binding of autoantibodies to platelets or to produce platelet antibodies with functional effects (Li et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2009). This approach was similarly used to discover molecular mimics in the HIV-1-encoded negative regulatory factor (nef) protein (Li et al. 2005), both leading toward therapeutic design in virus-induced thrombocytopenia.",

            "text": "Antibody crossreactivity between antiviral antigens and platelet antigens has been demonstrated during DENV infection (Cheng et al. 2009). Pairwise sequence alignment analysis programs were used to annotate homologous peptide sequences between DENV NS1 and platelet protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Cheng et al. 2009). This tool identified several sequence homologies, of which amino acid residues 311\u2013330 (P311\u2013330) was the most dominant epitope recognized by both anti-NS1 and anti-PDI, as determined by ELISA (Cheng et al. 2009). The P311\u2013330 antibodies generated from hyperimmunized mice bound platelet PDI and inhibited both thiol isomerase activity and platelet aggregation induced by ADP (Cheng et al. 2009). The presence of anti-platelet autoantibodies with anti-DENV activity in DENV patient sera is associated with thrombocytopenia and the severity of the disease during the acute phase of secondary DENV infection (Saito et al. 2004). However, the direct implication of these crossreactive antibodies in DENV pathogenesis has not yet been elucidated. The discovery that platelets can translate and express NS1 (Simon et al. 2015) suggests that viral antibodies might not be crossreactive with platelets, but actually recognize the virus-encoded gene product expressed on the platelet, further complicating vaccine development.",

This receptor engagement triggers mechanisms that can involve dynamin-dependent engulfment processes, leading to entry into the platelet as an endosomal inclusion. At least for DENV, which has an RNA genome unlike adenoviruses, evidence is accumulating that suggests viral genomic material is released from the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm, where it is translated by platelet ribosomal complexes or used as a template for replication by the virus-encoded polymerase. Other virus-encoded genes contribute to controlling the function of the cell or post-translational modification of the viral proteins, including proteolytic maturation if the viral genome is organized to produce a polyprotein. The viral structural proteins and genome copies are then transported to the platelet Golgi apparatus, where they are assembled and delivered to the exterior by exosomal transport or possibly by cell disruption (not shown).

Platelet microparticles may be released. The proPL surface can propagate the hypercoagulable state often induced by some of these viruses by enabling assembly of clotting enzyme complexes, where neighboring platelet surface PARs can be activated by thrombin (FIIa) in a feedback-amplified manner to further promote platelet modulation. Virus\u2013platelet engagement has been shown to induce caspase activation and mitochondrial membrane potential changes indicative of an apoptotic state, which similarly occurs for megakaryocytes (not shown) with consequent reduction in thrombopoeisis.
