Secondly, many synthetic members of this class of compounds, the so-called``arotinoids'' [9] or``retinoidal benzoic acid derivatives'' [10] as well as others, are not chemically retinoids.

In view of such dif\u00aeculties, the panel has recommended that all indications of charges be removed from biochemical equations and that the full chemical equations, which are written in terms of individual species which may be charged (e.g. H , Mg 2 , RCOO \u00c0 , etc.) should be used for those speci\u00aec cases where thermodynamic behaviour is to be considered.",

Since both chemical equations and biochemical equations are needed in biochemistry it is important that the reader should be able to distinguish between these two types of equations at a glance. Failure to make such a clear distinction can lead to hybrid equations that do not have corresponding equilibrium constant expressions and have incorrect stoichiometry. For example, the hydrolysis of 1 mol of ATP to ADP at approximately pH 7 does not produce 1 mol of H , as suggested by the equation: e r P y eh phosphte r but about 0.6 mol. Thus it is recommended that hybrid equations, in which some charges but not others are given, should be avoided as misleading.",

Biochemical equations do not balance hydrogen atoms, atoms of the bound metal or charge, but they do balance other kinds of atoms. The expression for the apparent equilibrium constant K H for any reaction can be written by looking at the biochemical equation. Chemical equations that do balance hydrogen ions, bound metal ions and charges can be written for these reactions and their equilibrium-constant expressions yield the equilibrium constant K, which is independent of pH and concentrations of free metal ions. Chemical equations have their uses in understanding how biochemical equations work and in analyzing the effects of pH and concentrations of free metal ions on the apparent equilibrium constants.

Like enzyme nomenclature, it is proposed that the nomenclature of catalytic antibodies should be based on the reaction catalysed, rather than on structural features. As more than one different``abzyme'' catalysing the same general reaction may be produced, there is clearly a possibility for confusion. However, the catalytic behaviour and speci\u00aecities may not be identical. Several possibilities are under discussion: they may be included in the Comments section for existing enzymes where they catalyse similar reactions, they might be given EC numbers or they might be given an``AB'' numbering system in a separate list based on the enzyme nomenclature classes. Examples of a possible classi\u00aecation of catalytic antibodies are given below. Comments on these possibilities and on the general value of such a listing would be most welcome.",
