As many of the clinical manifestations of KD (such as redness of eyes, redness of lips, tongue and oral cavity, rash and edema of the hands and feet) are commonly seen in childhood infectious diseases as well, the diagnosis of KD is often delayed or missed altogether. Parents often seek multiple consultations from different healthcare facilities. Many of these clinical signs are often not documented and might have disappeared by the time the child is seen by another doctor. Although KD is now being diagnosed frequently in several developing countries, there is no dearth of skeptics who question this diagnosis.19 In our experience there have been several instances when KD was diagnosed in time by a pediatrician but parents sought multiple consultations and several doctors questioned the diagnosis and this resulted in avoidable delays in initiation of specific treatment.20\n",

Experienced physicians who have treated many patients with KD may be able to arrive at a diagnosis within 3 days of fever.Presence of one or more principal clinical manifestations of disease that can be revealed on history but have disappeared by the time of presentation to the hospital, have been considered important for diagnosis. This has been a major change in the present guidelines as many physicians, especially in developing countries, have faced this problem due to late referrals. Because of multiple consultations in a febrile child, the acute stage clinical manifestations are often missed and not documented. By the time the diagnosis of KD is considered, many of the salient clinical manifestations would have already disappeared.Shock has been mentioned as an important cardiovascular manifestation of KD. KD shock syndrome (KDSS) has been given special consideration in the 2017 revised guidelines because in the presence of shock the diagnosis is often considered as bacterial sepsis. These patients are also at higher risk of developing coronary artery abnormalities, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) resistance and myocardial dysfunction.KD in infants has been given special consideration. It has been suggested that clinicians should have a lower threshold for diagnosis of KD in this age group. As per the recent guidelines, the diagnosis of KD in infants may be considered in the following situations:\ninfants < 6 months old with prolonged fever and irritabilityinfants with prolonged fever and unexplained aseptic meningitisinfants or children with prolonged fever and unexplained or culture\u2010negative shockinfants or children with prolonged fever and cervical lymphadenitis unresponsive to antibiotic therapyinfants or children with prolonged fever and retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal phlegmon unresponsive to antibiotic therapy.The issue of infections and KD has been detailed at length. It has been emphasized that the diagnosis of KD must not be excluded even in the presence of a documented infection when typical clinical features of KD are present. In the presence of some features of KD and when bacterial cultures are sterile or if there is response to antimicrobials, a possibility of KD must be considered.Bacterial lymphadenitis is often confused with the lymphadenitis of KD. The recent guidelines have emphasized the important ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) findings in differentiating the two conditions: bacterial lymphadenitis is often single and has a hypoechoic core on ultrasonography, while lymphadenopathy in KD is usually multiple and is associated with retropharyngeal edema or phlegmon.\n",

Furthermore, levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1 continued to remain elevated in patients with IVIg resistance or with coronary artery abnormalities. Th17 cytokine (IL\u201017) has also been found to be elevated in the acute phase of KD.

Similarly, a normal baseline echocardiogram in the first 7 days does not exclude the possibility of later development of coronary artery aneurysms.4 Experienced clinicians now recommend frequent echocardiography examinations during the first few days of the disease. This should be repeated at time of discharge and at 2 weeks.62 In developing countries, where trained pediatric cardiologists may not be easily accessible, echocardiography is often performed by cardiologists who deal with adults and may not have the expertise, experience and patience to perform detailed echocardiography examination of coronary artery abnormalities in small children.14, 63 As a result, the echocardiographic examination in these circumstances may not pick up these abnormalities that are often very subtle.
