The development of rapid and efficient automated platforms for the synthesis of nucleic acids and peptides from their monomeric building blocks (Figure 1 (a) and (b) ) has led to a better understanding of the fundamental interactions these biomolecules play in important biological processes. As a result, the fields of genomics and proteomics have grown exponentially with the development of new therapeutic strategies for disease prevention and treatment. Until recently, the lack of a general and accessible approach for the construction of oligosaccharides meant that only specialized research laboratories were capable of accessing defined glycoconjugates. This has slowed the pace of research in this area and in turn, our understanding of the diverse roles of these compounds in nature.",

The linear phosphodiester and amide bond linkages required for nucleic acid and peptide synthesis are easier to generate because the individual building blocks lack significant steric hindrance and the newly formed bonds are nonstereogenic. In contrast, the synthesis of oligosaccharides, which can be linear or branched, often involves more sterically encumbered building blocks and the newly formed bond is part of a stereogenic center. In order to be useful the reaction must generate the desired linkage with high selectivity.",

The synthesis of these glycoconjugates, which play important roles in the immune response to pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans, 2 began what would become a new chapter in the preparation of glycoconjugates for biological evaluation. Since then, automation has proven to be vastly beneficial. Additional bacterial antigens, cancer antigens, vaccine candidates, and N-linked core oligosaccharides are just a few of the glycoconjugates that have been rapidly synthesized using automation. Moreover, these glycoconjugates have been synthesized on scales that would have been impossible using standard solution-phase synthetic techniques. The goal of this chapter is to review the historical aspects of solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis as well as recent developments including engineering advancements that have recently led to the design of a fully automated platform, and new and improved chemistries that have broadened the scope of the reactions that can be used in automation. The automated solid-phase synthesis of several carbohydrate constructs including bacterial and viral antigens, cancer antigens, vaccine candidates, and N-linked core oligosaccharides is also presented.",

The general process is illustrated in Figure 3 . Selectively functionalized monosaccharide building blocks containing temporary and permanent protecting groups (commonly referred to as donors) serve as electrophiles and are added sequentially to a growing oligosaccharide chain, which serves as a nucleophile (or acceptor). The acceptor is connected via an inert linker to a solid support that is generally insoluble in organic solvents. Each glycosidic linkage is made by activating the appropriately functionalized monosaccharide building block (donor) in the presence of the growing nucleophilic oligosaccharide (acceptor) to couple to the two molecules. After each glycosylation reaction, the growing oligosaccharide is washed, the appropriate temporary protecting groups are removed to expose the next functional group for coupling, and the process is repeated until the desired oligosaccharide has been synthesized. The oligosaccharide is then removed from the solid support, purified if necessary, and the remaining temporary and permanent protecting groups are removed. The oligosaccharide can then be functionalized for further study.",

Developments in each of these areas have had a significant impact on the evolution of automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis. The first automated synthetic platform for automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis was developed by Seeberger and coworkers 1 and based on a modified Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer, the ABI 433. This system was chosen as a prototype because it was affordable and commercially available, it could accommodate up to nine different reagents/building blocks at one time, and required minimal modifications, namely a custom made jacketed reaction vessel connected to a variable cryostat to allow for controlled cooling of the reaction mixture. As a prototype, the ABI synthesizer played a critical role in the development of automated oligosaccharide synthesis. The synthesizer was reliable, and solvent delivery and waste removal were relatively efficient. In addition, reaction mixing, which was achieved by agitation of the reaction vessel, was effective in producing a uniform heterogeneous solution. However, the instrument, which was designed for peptide synthesis, had several shortcomings. Reagent delivery, which was achieved via solenoid valves, was imprecise. Therefore, the delivery of small reagent volumes or the delivery of reagents at a controlled delivery rate was difficult to achieve. In addition, the system could not be modified to accommodate additional reagents limiting the number of different glycosylation reactions that could be performed in a single run. Finally, temperature control required manual adjustment of the cryostat therefore, necessitating the continuous presence of an operator. For these reasons, the Seeberger group focused their efforts on the development of a new fully automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesizer.",

These resins generally exhibit high loading, are chemically inert to most of the reaction conditions required for glycosylation, and can be easily filtered from the reaction solution. The only disadvantage is that they require swelling to expose the reactive sites of the resin. Incomplete swelling can lead to incomplete reactions and deletion sequences. Controlled pore glass (CPG), which is a rigid, mechanically robust material that does not shrink or swell in the presence of solvents, has been used with high success for the synthesis of oligonucleotides; however, it has not attracted much attention for automated oligosaccharides synthesis for two major reasons. First, CPG loading, which is approximately 0.02-0.03 mmol g \u00c01 , is generally lower than Merrifield and Tentagel (0.30-0.40 mmol g \u00c01 ). Second, the growing oligosaccharide has been shown to eventually block the glass pores reducing diffusion of the reagents to the reactive sites. CPG with larger pore sizes has been used with some success, although the resin tends to be significantly more fragile.",

In contrast, electronwithdrawing groups destabilize acyloxonium/oxocarbenium ion intermediates by withdrawing electron density from the reactive site. This can have the affect of decreasing the reaction rate, and in extreme cases can impede reactivity altogether.

Mannosyl imidate 4 was glycosylated on to the linker using a catalytic amount of TMSOTf. Removal of the Lev group using hydrazine, followed by glycosylation with galactosyl phosphate 5 using a stoichiometric amount of TMSOTf gave the desired disaccharide. Hydrolysis of the C2 Ac under Zempl\u00e9n conditions, followed by glycosylation with mannosyl imidate 6 gave the desired trisaccharide. A second hydrolysis and glycosylation with 6, followed by cleavage with Grubbs' catalyst under an ethylene atmosphere gave the desired tetrasaccharide in 50% yield with approximately 85% coupling efficiency at each step.",

In 2010, approximately 216 million cases of malaria were recorded worldwide with more than 655 000 deaths reported (Data obtained from the World Health Organization). In 2002, a GPI toxin responsible for the pathogenesis of the parasite was identified and targeted for vaccine development. 37 Shortly thereafter, the first automated solid-phase synthesis was reported. 38 Four selectively functionalized imidate building blocks, 7, 1, 8, and 9, were required for this synthesis (Scheme 9). The use of acetates as temporary protecting groups and the need to install a second mannose residue at the C6 position of the reducing sugar required that imidate 7, with a nonparticipating group at C2, be employed for this synthesis. Glycosylation of mannosyl imidate 7 on to the octenediol-functionalized Merrifield resin using the 'double coupling' strategy and stoichiometric amount of TMSOTf led to a mixture of a and b anomers. This mixture was inconsequential since later steps in the synthesis of the vaccine candidate required hydrolysis of the pentenyl tether and refunctionalization of the reducing sugar. Methanolysis of the C6 Ac to the corresponding hydroxyl group using Zempl\u00e9n conditions provided the corresponding nucleophile required for extension. Subsequent glycosylation/hydrolysis cycles with imidates 1, 8, and 9 gave the final tetrasaccharide in 44% yield after cleavage from the resin (approximately 82% coupling efficiency at each step). It is worth noting that the employment of building block 8 represented the first use of a silyl-protecting group in automated oligosaccharide synthesis. ",

The synthesis of Le y is shown in Scheme 17. Successive 'double coupling' of building blocks 16, 27, 28, 23, 29 , and 29 gave the desired hexasaccharide in 10% yield after cleavage from the resin using Zempl\u00e9n conditions.

Hyaluronic acids function as molecular lubricants and have also been shown to play important roles in the inflammatory response, cell proliferation, recognition, migration, and adhesion. 53 The first automated solid-phase synthesis of well-defined hyaluronic acids employed the second-generation automated synthesizer. Butenediol-functionalized Merrifield resin and a 'triple coupling' strategy using 3 equivalents of two di-tert-butylsilylidene-protected imidate building blocks 34 and 35 (Scheme 21) incorporating C2 participating groups (TCA for building block 34 and Bz for building block 35) and Lev groups as temporary protecting groups. 7 Activation of glucosylamine imidate 34 using TfOH, which was demonstrated to be more efficient than TMSOTf, followed by hydrolysis of the Lev protecting group with hydrazine and iterative glycosylation reactions with disaccharide 35 gave the desired glycans in 18-26% yield (n \u00bc 3, 5, or 7) after cross-metathesis from the resin. Interestingly, the authors demonstrated that direct glycosylation of disaccharide 35 to the linker was unsuccessful, necessitating the synthesis of building block 34. In addition, removal of the glycan from the resin using cross-metathesis using Grubbs' catalyst proved challenging due to the partial dechlorination of the TCA group. The use of a decoy substrate, trichloracetamide, was used to circumvent this unwanted reaction.",

They are also major constituents of the exopolysaccharides of Pseudomonas aerigunosa, 54 an opportunistic, nonsocomial gram-negative bacterium. The automated synthesis of tetra-, octa-, and dodeca-b-mannuronic acid alginates via automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis was recently reported using the second-generation automated oligosaccharide synthesizer, butenediol-functionalized Merrified resin, and a mannuronic imidate building block 36 functionalized with a nonparticipating Bn at C2 and a temporary Lev protecting group at C4 (Scheme 22). 55 The major challenge with this synthesis was the selective installation of each b-mannosidic residue. TfOH was found to be the most effective promoter and the reaction was found to be completely selective at temperatures near the decomposition of the donor ( \u00c0 40 1C). Each glycosylation cycle required hydrolysis of the Lev group using hydrazine. The first oligosaccharide synthesized, a tetrasaccharide, was prepared using four glycosylation/deprotection cycles in 90% yield with approximately 98% coupling efficiency. The octasaccharide and dodecasaccharides were synthesized with 90% coupling efficiency at each step providing the final products in 55% and 40%, respectively. 9.05.7.10.1 Oligoarabinofuranosides",

[57] [58] [59] The versatility of the second-generation synthesizer combined with the use of the bifunctional linker provided for the synthesis of a series of linear and branched oliogarabinofuranosides from the sequential 'double coupling' of two thiofuranosides 37 and 38, both of which contained a Bz participating group at C2 and temporary F-moc protecting groups at C5 (37) or C4 and C5 (38) . The use of NIS/TfOH as a promoter system was shown to provide the best yields and selectivites. Piperdine was used to remove the Fmoc protecting groups in between coupling cycles. Overall, this process was shown to be efficient and rapid -the hexasaccharide in Scheme 23 was prepared with 63% yield and 92% coupling efficiency in 14 h.",

Current research is directed at identifying monosaccharide building blocks that can be used to access the major glycoconjugate classes including N-linked, O-linked, glycolipids, and glycosylaminoglycans. These oligosaccharides will be used to study important carbohydrate-protein, carbohydrate-nucleic acid, and carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions involved in normal and abnormal cellular processes. The development of rapid and efficient synthetic protocols for commercialization of these building blocks is the next critical step for expanding the automated solid-phase platform for oligosaccharide synthesis.",

Participating groups such as esters, which form an intermediate acyloxonium ion intermediate, create steric hindrance on one face of the donor permitting attack at the opposite face favoring 1,2-trans linkages. Nonparticipating groups, such as ethers, are unable to participate and therefore, the intermediate oxocarbenium ion can be attacked from either side of the carbohydrate residue. However, formation of the 1,2-cis linkage is often favored due to the anomeric affect.",
