Antibiotic treatment is of limited benefit both overall and in subgroups at higher risk of an adverse course. Nevertheless, antibiotics are prescribed for most patients with LRTI [2], [3], [4], [5]. Primary analysis of the largest trial to date, the Genomics to combat Resistance against Antibiotics in Community-acquired LRTI (GRACE; http://www.grace-lrti.org) randomized placebo controlled trial (RCT), found no clear evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit from treatment with amoxicillin [2]. A follow-up analysis that examined the benefit of amoxicillin in clinically defined subgroups of patients with LRTI who are most likely to be prescribed antibiotics (i.e. patients with green sputum or those with significant comorbidities) found no clear evidence of meaningful benefit from amoxicillin even in these subgroups [3]. Only those patients with evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray benefited from amoxicillin treatment [6].",

In summary, non-pregnant adults presenting to primary care with acute cough, in whom pneumonia was not suspected, were recruited between November 2007 and April 2010 by primary care physicians in 16 networks across 12 European countries (Belgium, England, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Wales). Patients who did not consume antibiotics in the month before consultation were randomized to receive either an antibiotic (amoxicillin 1 g) or a placebo three times daily for 7 consecutive days. All patients were asked to complete a symptom diary daily until their symptoms had settled (up to a maximum of 28 days). The diary recorded the severity of cough, phlegm, shortness of breath, wheezing, runny nose, chest pain, muscle ache, headache, disturbed sleep, feeling unwell, fever, and interference with daily activities. Symptoms were scored on a 7-point scale (0: normal/not affected, 1: very little problem, 2: slight problem, 3: moderately bad, 4: bad, 5: very bad, 6: as bad as it could be) [10]. For each patient, a nasopharyngeal swab was taken on the day of presentation. This sample was then analysed using bacterial and viral polymerase chain reaction analysis. We tested for both bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumoniae) and viral pathogens (rhinovirus, influenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, polyomavirus, bocavirus) [11]. Samples with a pathogen present, either bacterial or viral, were referred to as confirmed infections. Samples in which a bacterial pathogen was detected were referred to as bacterial infections. If no viral pathogens were present in these samples, they were referred to as purely bacterial infections. Samples in which a viral pathogen was detected were referred to as viral infections. If no bacterial pathogens were present in these samples, they were referred to as purely viral infections. Samples in which both a bacterial and a viral pathogen were detected were referred to as combined infections. Note that these categorizations are not mutually exclusive. Within 24 hours of presentation to the GP, a venous blood sample was obtained. CRP and BUN were measured using the conventional immunoturbidimetric method. PCT was measured using a rapid sensitive assay [11]. We defined an elevated CRP, PCT, and BUN as the top 25% of measurements in our patient population (referred to as high CRP, high PCT, and high BUN, respectively).",
