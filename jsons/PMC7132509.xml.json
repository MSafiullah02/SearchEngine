As new struggles emerged on a daily basis, responses and implementation were immediately necessitated. Policy considerations that affected day-to-day patient care comprised infection control and patient care protocols as well as integrated change and in some cases a sense of systematic chaos. Virus spread was ultimately contained in hospitals through restricted entry as well as limited movement within and between health care facilities. Screening processes elicited information about individual exposures, symptoms, and epidemiologic links to SARS [5], and hospital entry was restricted on the basis of this reported information. Visitors to hospitals were largely eliminated except for immediate family members of critically ill, dying, birthing or pediatric patients [5]. Even in these critical situations, pediatric patients were limited to only one parent visitor at a time, although in some cases, children had no visitors.",

Negative pressure isolation rooms with antechambers were used for patients thought to have SARS, and staff were required to remain outside negative pressure isolation rooms as much as possible [10]. Clearly, SARS resulted in substantial changes to health care practice and frequent shifts in infection control requirements, with health care providers reporting substantial frustration and anxiety [6].",

As the pediatric crisis of SARS in Canada was relatively localized, we attempted to include all eligible pediatric SARS patients and their parents, as well as the respective health care provider. All participants were interviewed 2 months after hospitalization to provide time for experiential reflection and patient recovery. Interview questions invited participants to systematically document and identify their experiences; perceived policy and practice implications of SARS; and lessons learned in the event of a future outbreak. Patient participants were recruited from a database of all children in Toronto admitted to hospital for suspected or probable SARS (a classification clinically determined by fever and/or radiographic evidence of chest pathology). While children under 6 years of age were also admitted with probable or suspected SARS, they were not interviewed due to their young age; however, parents of these young patients (n =\n 5 parents of young children) were included in the sample of interviewed parents. Sampled children and parents represented a range of cultural backgrounds, and all children ultimately recovered from SARS. Health outcomes for parent participants ranged from full recovery to death.",

They described vicarious strain when implementing and justifying restrictions and then, in some cases, enacting policy changes. A health care provider explained:It was hard in terms of the families.

This resulted in children being more informed and understanding, and also expressing fewer fears over the changes in health care. However, explanations directed to children could have occurred much earlier which, participants suggest, would have fostered adherence. This finding is consistent with earlier SARS literature which suggests that greater explanation of reasons for protocols such as quarantine, is linked to increased compliance [21], [22], and highlights the significance of ensuring that children, as major stakeholders, receive the information they need in developmentally appropriate ways. These findings suggest that the flow of information in pediatric settings presents unique challenges for health care providers, particularly in ensuring that information is as comprehensible as possible, yet also as simple and clear as possible even for the very young child.",
