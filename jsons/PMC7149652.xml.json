The earliest known attempts to intentionally transfer immunity to an infectious disease occurred in China in the tenth century. It involved exposing uninfected people to material from lesions caused by smallpox. This not always successful practice was introduced in the seventeenth century to the Ottoman Empire and subsequently to England and its colonies in North America.",

Further studies fully supported the clonal selection theory (Burnet, Jerne, and Talmage).

This has provided evolutionary advantages allowing the recognition of potentially lethal pathogens, including viruses, and the initiation of protective responses against them (Figure 1\n), and represented an add-on to a preexisting innate immune system. For immunoglobulins, somatic variation was further expanded through class switching, gene conversion, and somatic hypermutation. Jawless vertebrates (agnathans) were shown to also have an adaptive immune system based on recombinatorial assembly of genetic units different from those of gnasthostomes, to generate a diverse repertoire of lymphocytes, each with distinct receptors (Figure 2\n).

Two of these, relevant to passive immunotherapy and development of diagnostics using the corresponding immunoglobulins, are mentioned here. (1) Only three classes of H-chain genes, corresponding to IgM, IgY, and IgA, exist in chicken. Class switching occurs from IgM to either IgY or IgA. IgY is considered to be the ancestor of \u2018present-day\u2019 IgG and IgE. Unlike human IgG, IgY does not bind to cellular Fc receptors and to proteins A and G, respectively, and does not activate the complement system. (2) H-chain antibodies devoid of light chains occur in the Camelidae species (camels, dromedaries, and llamas). Single-domain fragments from such antibodies react with specific antigens with high affinity constants (nanomolar range). The binding involves longer than average third variable loops of the antibody molecules. These unique antibodies and their antigen-specific fragments are expected to become important for biotechnological and medical applications, including intrabodies (intracellular antibodies).",

The innate system predates evolutionarily the adaptive system and relies on antimicrobial peptides and on germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). Antimicrobial peptides can damage enveloped viruses and interfere with processes involved in fusion of viruses with target cell membranes. PRRs recognize microbial (viral) components defined as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Different PRRs are specific for distinct PAMPs, have distinct expression patterns, activate different signaling pathways, thereby eliciting distinct responses against invading pathogens.

            "text": "\nToll was originally identified as a differentiation protein in Drosophila, and later (1996) shown to play a role in defense against fungal infection. Searching the entire DNA sequence database for similarities with the coding sequence for Toll resulted in identification of Toll-like sequences, and ultimately in discovery of at least 10 functional TLRs in humans. TLRs are type 1 integral membrane glycoproteins the extracellular domain of which contains several LRR motifs and a cytoplasmic signaling domain homologous to that of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R). TLRs 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 recognize PAMPs characteristic for viruses. Viral DNAs rich in CpG motifs are recognized by TLR9, leading to activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion. TLR7 and TLR8, expressed within the endosomal membrane, are specific for viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), generated during viral infection as an intermediate for ssRNA viruses or during transcription of viral DNA, is recognized by TLR3. TLR3 is expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) and in a variety of epithelial cells, including airway, uterine, corneal, vaginal, cervical, biliary, and intestinal cells. Cervical mucosal epithelial cells also express functional TLR9, suggesting that TLR3 and TLR9 provide an antiviral environment for the lower female reproductive tract. Some viral envelope glycoproteins are recognized by TLR2 and TLR4, each expressed at the cell surface, leading to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In general, the engagement of TLRs by microbial PAMPs triggers signaling cascades leading to the induction of genes involved in antimicrobial host defenses. This includes the maturation and migration of DCs from sites where infection occurs to lymphoid organs where DCs can initiate antigen-specific immune responses. Triggering distinct TLRs elicits different cytokine profiles and different immune responses. Engagement of TL3 and TRL 4, respectively, upregulates polymeric immunoglobulin receptor expression on cells. Thus, bridges between innate and adaptive immune responses are established.",

A nonstructural protein of hepatitis C virus blocks signaling by RIG-1 and MDA5. Marburg and Ebola viruses, members of the family Filoviridae, elicit direct activation of TREM-1 on neutrophils.

            "text": "Differentiation of B-cells into antibody-generating plasma cells occurs through distinct pathways. Two pathways lead to rapid IgM and IgA antibody production by B-1 cells against T-cell-independent antigens. These antibodies have low antigen-binding constants, and immunological memory does not evolve. The third pathway involves clonal selection. The B-cells synthesize IgM and IgD low affinity antibodies which are expressed as antigen receptors on the surface of cells. Each B-cell produces a different receptor recognizing a distinct epitope. Encounter with the appropriate epitope on an antigen elicits cell division, and generation of selected clones with identical receptor specificities. The clones further differentiate into specific antibody-secreting cells. The remarkable diversity of antibodies is attributable to the fact that genes coding for Ig variable regions are inherited as sets of gene fragments, each encoding a portion of the variable region of a particular Ig polypeptide chain. The fragments are joined together to form a complete gene in individual lymphocytes. The joining process involves addition of DNA sequences to the ends of fragments to be joined, thus increasing diversity. Further diversity arises from the assembly of each Ig protein from pairs of H- and L-chains, each B-cell producing only one kind of either chain (Figure 4\n). In addition, the assembled genes for Ig's mutate rapidly when B-cells are activated by binding an antigen. These hypermutations lead to new receptor variants representing the process of affinity maturation of an immune response. Moreover, B-cells and their progeny can produce an additional variation by altering the constant part of the H chain due to gene rearrangements (=Ig isotype and subclass switching) (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7\n). These antibodies have identical paratopes but distinct effector functions (complement activation, phagocytosis, transcytosis, etc.). As a consequence of the aforementioned processes, there are B-lymphocytes of at least 100 million distinct specificities in every human individual at any given time.",

There are two subclasses of IgA, IgA1 and IgA2, which occur in monomeric, dimeric, tetrameric, and polymeric (pIgA) forms. A distinguishing feature of secretory IgA is its association with another glycoprotein, the secretory component (SC) (Figure 8\n).

Direct occupancy by VNAb of cell receptor binding sites on the virus surface might not be obligatory for neutralization. Steric hindrance or induction of deleterious conformational changes may be sufficiently effective. A unique feature of several anti-HIV-1 human monoclonal VNAb, having distinct specificities, is a very long finger-like third complementarity determining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain allowing access to a recessed critical site on HIV-1 gp120. Such feature is rare in the human immunoglobulin repertoire but is common in the Ig's of Camelidae.",

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been demonstrated to occur in vitro with members of the families Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Retroviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Togaviridae. A link between in vitro ADE and clinical manifestations cannot be always established. A relationship between ADE and disease exacerbation has been observed for dengue, measles, yellow fever, and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs). ADE may occur in children infected at a time when the level of transferred maternal antiviral antibodies declines to insufficient levels. ADE could represent an obstacle for development of vaccines, as has been the case for anti-RSV vaccines.
