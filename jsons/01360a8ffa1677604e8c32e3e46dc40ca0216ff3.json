What is a contact case investigation? \"Epidemic\" refers to an increase in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in a given population and geographic area (any activity above baseline). Typically, this implies a rapid increase above baseline; however, \"epidemic\" has also been used to describe a slower but consistent increase in baseline, such as the changes seen in prevalence of obesity or type 2 diabetes over the past several decades. If an epidemic spans several countries or continents and impacts a large number of people, it is often referred to as a \"pandemic\" [1] . \"Outbreak\" is also defined as an increase in disease activity but is usually reserved to describe infectious disease activity that occurs over a limited geographic area and over a shorter timeframe [1] .",

            "text": "All individuals with active TB should receive case management services because adherence to treatment for active TB can be challenging for many reasons, including the number of medications needed (multiple drugs are needed to improve cure rates and decrease likelihood of drug resistance), the side effects of these multiple drugs, the length of required treatment (minimum 6 months), and the fact that symptoms often resolve within a few weeks which can decrease motivation to continue medications. According to the CDC: \"Directly observed therapy (DOT) may be defined as a course of treatment, or preventive treatment, for TB in which the prescribed course of medication is administered to the person or taken by the person under direct observation by a trained healthcare worker. DOT increases cure rates among patients with TB and is also effective in decreasing drug resistance, treatment failure, relapse, and mortality\" [4] . The trained healthcare worker should then ideally record all of the treatment data into the health information system to optimize management of the case. The CDC recommends that DOT be used for all patients with active TB [5] . In addition to recommending DOT as part of the treatment protocol for patients with active TB, DOT may be recommended as part of the treatment protocol for latent TB depending on the person being treated (e.g., children) or the treatment plan (e.g., once/twice weekly regimens) [6] . Most people who are exposed to infectious TB disease do not develop active TB disease. The most important risk factor for someone to have latent TB is to be exposed to someone with infectious TB disease. The following list of risk factors for exposure is from the CDC [7]: 5 Close contacts of a person with infectious TB disease 5 Persons who have lived in an area of the world with high rates of TB 5 Persons who work or reside with people who are at high risk for TB in facilities or institutions such as hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes, and residential homes for those with HIV Some people develop active TB disease soon after becoming infected (within weeks) before their immune system can fight the TB bacteria. Other people may get sick years later, when their immune system becomes weak for another reason.",

The discussion becomes more controversial when the key concern is about communicable disease transmission. There is an inherent risk of exposure to communicable diseases in health care. Do healthcare professionals assume that risk when they choose to enter the field? Primacy of patient welfare is a core principle for healthcare officials; however, it must be balanced with personal risk to the healthcare professional. The risk can and should be mitigated by strong infection control policies and procedure to minimize the risks. However, in situations of uncertainty, particularly with emerging infectious diseases, a common-sense risk reduction approach should be taken into account. For example, during the severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) epidemic in Toronto, Canada, 90% of the reported cases of SARS were associated with exposure at a single hospital. Healthcare workers, including students, comprised almost 40% of the cases. In a situation in which students have very little to offer with respect to patient welfare but are at significant personal risk, it is reasonable to question whether it is ethical to expose them to the risk [17] .",

In the early 1980s, when HIV and AIDS were first becoming recognized, it took more than 2 years for scientists to understand that a virus was the source of the disease. Many physicians refused to treat patients suspected of having the disease. One example taken from a New York Times article from 1987 is from the chief heart surgeon at Milwaukee hospital: \"I've got to be selfish. I've got to think about myself; I've got to think about my family. That responsibility is greater than to the patient\" [19] . v 6. When can physicians-ethically and legally-refuse to treat a patient? When are they obligated to treat patients? In general, federal laws have protections to prevent discrimination, which prohibit physicians from refusing to treat patients for racial or religious reason. Furthermore, \"[m]any states prohibit places of \"public accommodation, \" including doctors' offices and hospitals, from discriminating on the basis of characteristics such as race, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, religion, creed, age, marital status, familial status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, medical condition, disability, or other personal features -although, beyond the baseline federal protections, the grounds that are included vary by jurisdiction. Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance, including Medicaid and Medicare. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 adds disability to that list\" [20] . Outside of the aforementioned parameters, it may not be illegal for a physician to refuse to treat a patient, but there are significant ethical concerns about a physician doing so. There is a complex balance between the physician's autonomy and the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. For example, if another provider is not available to see the patient, a physician refusing to treat a patient for fear of contracting a communicable disease seems to be violating both non-maleficence and justice. The refusing physician may cause direct harm (by neglect) to the patient as well as to the community in which they live (by eroding trust). With respect to justice, consider justice both in relation to the patient who is not receiving timely care and the community to which the patient belongs. That community is now at risk if the case patient does not receive medical attention because there could be ongoing transmission of disease. In another scenario, in which a different provider is able and willing to see the patient, the patient is not directly harmed by a physician who refuses to treat. However, again, the physician's behavior may cause distrust (harm) in the healthcare system. Furthermore, is the physician who refuses to see the patient acting unjustly to the other physician present? Not only might this impact the patient load of the physician who picks up the extra case but now that individual is exposed to the communicable disease.",

Every case of infectious TB should prompt a contact case investigation to identify other cases of latent or infectious TB. Rarely, a source case investigation is done to identify where the newly diagnosed person became infected. Since, in the United States, most cases of active TB are due to reactivation, years after initial infection, it is almost impossible to identify the source.

In it, the health department details the results of an investigation of recent cases of tuberculosis. The investigation revealed that all of the men who had tuberculosis had been in homeless shelters over that past couple of months; two of them were known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The advisory provided recommendations for healthcare facilities to help manage cases of tuberculosis, including a reminder for healthcare facilities to ensure that they have the capacity to rapidly identify and isolate any cases of suspected TB, as was accomplished in this case. v 10. What is the difference between isolation and quarantine? Is either of these strategies useful in this case? When referring to the control of communicable diseases, the term \"isolation\" refers to the separation of ill persons from those who are not ill. In a hospital setting, this typically refers to placing a patient with a communicable disease, such as tuberculosis, in an appropriately equipped room. In the community setting, for an individual who is not ill enough to require hospitalization, this may refer to mandating restrictions of movement for the person with a communicable disease, often requiring that the individual stay in one place, removed from all others. For active infectious TB disease, the health department may consider random home visits or landline phone calls to ensure adherence to these requirements [22] . The term \"quarantine\" refers to the separation and/or movement restrictions of well persons who are thought to have been exposed to a communicable disease but who are not yet ill. The timing and the duration of quarantine are directly related to the incubation period of the particular communicable disease [22] . v 11. Would quarantine be an ethical tool in the case of tuberculosis, given what you know about its transmission? A patient with latent TB does not have infectious TB disease and is not able to spread the disease and therefore poses no threat to others. In this case, it would not be an ethical tool.",

            "text": "-month followup TST for those with an initial negative TST, chest X-ray, and clinical assessment. Any individual identified with active TB was isolated and treated under directly observed therapy (DOT). v 15. Why do you think directly observed therapy (DOT) is recommended for active TB? Treatment for active TB requires a lot of medications over a long period of time. Typically, treatment for infectious TB includes four-drug therapy for at least 2 months followed by an additional 4 months of two-drug treatment. Adherence is a significant challenge, and poor adherence is associated with development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Significant barriers for patients to adhere to the treatment regimen include the number and duration of medications, particularly once the individual is asymptomatic, as well as side effects. Having a person facilitate scheduling and delivery of medications may increase adherence and decrease the risk of drug resistance. v 16. If a patient with infectious tuberculosis refuses DOT, legal action may be pursued under some circumstances. What are the potential risks and benefits of legal action, such as a court order, to mandate treatment? Historically, court orders have been issued for involuntary detention/hospitalization if an individual with infectious tuberculosis does not comply with treatment recommendations. In many states, laws allow patients to be confined if they can be shown to be infectious (i.e., if they can be shown to be a present threat).In most states, this does not allow for future threat; in other words, a person cannot be forced to complete therapy once the sputa are negative. The key benefit for such legal action is increased adherence to the TB treatment protocol.In addition, such action may increase the public's trust of their local health authority. The key risk is that because there are typically limits on how long an individual can be detained or hospitalized, it is unlikely that treatment will be completed under these circumstances, and it is possible that the individual stops treatment and inadvertently contributes to drug resistance. Furthermore, on the part of the individual and the individual's family and friends, such aggressive tactics may increase distrust in the system and deter others from seeking care if they become ill.v 17. Do you think court orders are an ethical tool? Why or why not? Yes. It has been well established that there are reasonable limits to a person's autonomy, but there are several caveats important to consider when ensuring that a court order is implemented appropriately. Is the person whose rights are being infringed upon a threat to the public? (Does the person have infectious TB disease?) Have all other measures to have that individual comply with isolation been exhausted? Will the individual's needs for food/shelter/medical care be met in a humane manner? v 18. Do you think court orders are an effective tool? In the inpatient setting, adherence to isolation precautions for patients with communicable diseases can decrease nosocomial transmission of disease, but evidence for the impact of court orders is less well established. The effectiveness of court orders for containing the risk of tuberculosis is limited by the duration of treatment needed for tuberculosis and the interpretation of \"a public health threat.\" For example, if a judge deems someone to be at risk only if he has positive sputa cultures, once the person is treated for 2 or more weeks, the sputa are likely to be negative, and the judge may deem that the individual no longer poses an imminent public health threat. If the individual is no longer compelled to adhere to the treatment regimen and discontinues treatment, he may develop drug-resistant TB, which in turn may lead to an even greater public threat. Given different laws across different jurisdictions, it is unlikely that the judicial system can address this issue consistently and comprehensively. Furthermore, it is conceivable that issuing a court order for one person with TB could lead other people suspected of having TB disease to go \"underground,\" thereby potentially increasing the threat of transmission of TB within the community. this contact investigation, the health department also recommended DOT for many of the individuals identified with TB infection. v 19. Do you agree with the health department's decision to provide DOT to individuals with latent TB infection? Why or why not? Individuals with risk factors for poor adherence (homelessness, substance use disorders, prior history of poor adherence, etc.) may be considered for DOT for latent TB. In addition, DOT is often recommended for children with latent TB. In some jurisdictions, the local health department works with school nurses to have the medications administered at school in order to increase adherence. Unfortunately, even though DOT was ordered for almost 90 men, very few individuals actually completed therapy. Over the following year, several more homeless men from this community were diagnosed with active TB. DNA fingerprinting demonstrated that the majority of cases were caused by an identical strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, indicating a common source. An isolate from one case was closely related and felt to be a variant of the same strain related. Almost half of the men diagnosed with active TB had a history of a prior positive TST and had initiated therapy at some point in the past, but none was known to have completed a full course of therapy. It was determined that concurrent HIV infections had contributed to the epidemic. Over the ensuing years, the same strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in homeless individuals living in shelters in other states.",

            "text": "As a future physician or other healthcare practitioner practicing in this community, what public health policies would you recommend to address the prevention of tuberculosis in high-risk settings? Examples of potential policies to decrease the risk of TB in high-risk settings include: 5 Policy for homeless shelters to ensure identification of infectious and latent TB, for example, requiring overnight visitors/residents to have a card that documents their TST results (and treatment status if applicable) 5 Improved ventilation, ultraviolet (UV) lights in homeless shelters 5 Improvement in housing policies that decrease the number of people in shelters 5 Incentives for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) (fastfood coupons, transportation tokens, small gifts, drinks, pudding, etc. for the children) v 21. Do you think that physicians or other healthcare practitioners have a responsibility to advocate for such policies? If so, how would they do so and whom would they enlist to help? One aspect of physicians' professional obligations is to society. Physicians and other healthcare practitioners are uniquely situated to understand the individual consequences of certain policies. In this case, they can ask the local health department what they are doing and advocate for them to get involved if they have not enacted all of these types of policies already. In most areas, the local health department will be the subject matter expert in this; physicians can work with the health department to understand barriers to implementation and identify ways that local physicians can better support the department.",
