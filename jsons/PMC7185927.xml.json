            "text": "Early prediction of human toxicity is critical in decreasing the costs of drug development, and in silico testing has recently been promoted as an important, human-based tool for preclinical evaluation (11). In silico, or computational, modeling refers to experiments or elements of experiments that are performed on computer computational models or via computer simulation. An in silico method is not simply a statistical analysis of known experimental data, but rather is a modeling approach using known characteristics of a chemical or chemical similar to it, information about the underlying chemical or biological system in which it will be used, and, when available, known preclinical and clinical data to predict untested system-level behaviors of a given chemical. Mayourian et al. (12) provide a detailed review of various in silico techniques particularly relevant to cardiovascular (CV) research.",

Computational research does not yet provide complete replacement of animal experimentation in drug development but can significantly increase the scale and speed of preclinical drug development, thus reducing expense in animal testing phases, leveraging information from fewer experimental animals to increase drug development, decreasing the timeline for new drugs to enter the market by reducing the time for preclinical testing, reducing overall costs of drug development, and improving access to new and novel therapies for patients in need. Today, practically all toxicological research already includes in silico elements (13).",

            "text": "Another potentially important advantage of in silico testing is its potential to identify areas for rescue or repurposing of existing drugs (14). Rescue refers to redirecting drugs that have already failed efficacy trials for one application, but then can be successfully reintroduced into clinical trials for another indication. Repurposing of a drug (also called \u201crepositioning\u201d or \u201creprofiling\u201d) involves reapplying drugs that are either in clinical use already, or might have been retired from further development or marketing\u2014because of production of a more efficacious drug, risks of adverse effects, or commercialization considerations\u2014to new indications. In both cases, preclinical phases and animal testing can often be bypassed altogether, and if human clinical phase trials are needed, they may be abbreviated to late-phase studies for the new indication, saving years of clinical testing (15). Costs of drug approval for repurposing or rescue are estimated by some authors to be around $40 to $80 million, compared with $1 to $2 billion for the development of an entirely new entity (16). Repurposing of approved drugs may even be accomplished without going through reapproval at all, as once the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a marketing approval for any purpose, off-label use for other purposes is at the discretion of the physician, so long as the physician feels it is \u201cmedically appropriate for their patient\u201d (17). A contemporary example of repurposing an established drug is the proposed use of chloroquine\u2014an approved treatment for malaria, long used to treat some autoimmune diseases such as lupus\u2014for treatment of coronavirus infection. Chloroquine has the advantage of already being approved (which means that animal toxicity studies do not need to be repeated) and it has a human side effect profile that is largely understood, at least in its current usages. It is an FDA-approved drug that could therefore be used off label without FDA-approved human clinical trials, and is immediately available. However, it is critical to point out that, as of this writing, it is not known to be efficacious against coronaviruses, and it has significant potential human toxicity. It is vital that reasonable human data be generated before it can be determined whether or not it should be recommended for coronavirus patients\u2014to avoid unknown toxicities and to avoid creating a shortage of drug that would not only be of minimal benefit to pandemic victims, but also prevent patients who are known to benefit from it from being treated.",

            "text": "While computer models alone would seem to be an unlikely predictor of drug behavior within complex physiologic systems or human beings, such modeling is nevertheless proving to be both effective and clinically relevant. In 2012, University of California, San Francisco researchers were able to successfully \u201cpredict\u201d side effects (i.e., not merely the adverse side effects) of 656 drugs on the market, based on a computer model that compared the similarity of the drugs\u2019 chemical structures to other molecules known to cause the same side effects (18), showing that such models could potentially be used early in drug development to prioritize which agents to pursue or repurpose. Of note, 26% of the side-effect targets identified by the computer model were entirely unrelated to the previously known targets of the drugs (39 of 151), suggesting that previously unrecognized therapeutic effects might be found for existing drugs, allowing them to be repurposed for new diseases and conditions. Despite these exciting findings, however, the model suffered from similar problems of poor specificity to that of animal studies: almost one-half (46%) of its predictions of adverse drug activity proved to be false. Luechtefeld et al. (19) demonstrated that a computer comparison algorithm predicted toxicity for thousands of chemicals across 9 types of tests\u2014from inhalational injury to hazards to aquatic environments\u2014with accuracy similar to that of animal models, and with better reproducibility.",

As a result, guidelines for new drug development include clinical testing for electrophysiologic changes that might predict QT changes specifically (21). In vitro assays relevant to this change are relatively easy to perform but demonstrate marginal likelihood ratios for predicting toxicity (22). When combined with computational simulations, Lancaster and Sobie (23) were able to use solely in vitro preclinical data to correctly classify 86 drugs as torsadogenic or nontorsadogenic approximately 90% of the time. In 2017, Passini et al. (24) found that a computer simulation of human heart cells was better able to predict risk of arrhythmogenicity of 62 drugs\u2014including analgesics, antihistamines, and antibiotics\u2014than animal testing (accuracy of 89% to 96% vs. 75% to 85%, respectively).

More than 300 companies now supply antibodies for such research and development, with an estimated market value in 2011 of $1.6 billion (32). However, antibodies produced from immunized animals exhibit variability in DNA sequencing and variability in target binding. The lack of reproducibility in research using animal-based antibodies has been deemed a \u201ccrisis,\u201d with some scientists claiming that over one-half of all commercially available antibodies are unreliable in binding their intended targets (32). One proposed way to tackle the problems of variability in animal-produced antibody structure and targeting is the use of antibodies manufactured in engineered \u201crecombinant\u201d cells, and the use of antibodies from \u201chuman antibody libraries\u201d (33).

The models are easy manipulated genetically, and they behave quantitatively much like native muscle, making them reasonable platforms for disease modeling and toxicity testing. In 2018, for example, Truitt et al.

In tissue culture, for example, it is difficult to maintain cellular functions for sustained periods of time. Tissue culture cells receive nutrients, oxygen and other substances almost solely by diffusion. However, in vivo, cells obtain oxygen, nutrients, and other substances that regulate their function via blood flow, and they experience and respond to physical stimulation such as stretching and sheer forces within their complex environments. Such differences may account for rapid deactivation, senescence, and cellular loss in many in vitro cultures. In addition, interactions between organs cannot be directly tested in tissue culture.",

In one case, a proprietary test compound from Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Raritan, New Jersey), which had shown liver inflammation in rats and was subsequently discontinued from further development, showed replication of the rat findings but demonstrated a lack of toxicity in human cells. With a second proprietary compound, the canine portion of the canine chip was able to replicate the liver inflammation that had been found in dogs, and also suggested changes in human cells, suggesting a high likelihood of human toxicity. In addition, the authors tested their chip against drugs that had survived preclinical animal tests, only to be discontinued during human trials due to liver toxicity, and found that the chip accurately predicted human toxicity (Table 1). This is particularly intriguing news, as liver injury is the most frequent reason for post market withdrawal of drugs (69). Cross-species chips may be able to hone animal testing to only those species whose toxicity has been shown by chip analysis to be relevant to humans, sparing animals, time, and expense while preserving human safety.",

Although the FDA has emphasized support for alternative research methods, to date most therapeutics require animal testing in the preclinical phases, and do not allow substitution of alternative methods. Under the 21st Century Cures Act (72), certain therapeutics wholly or partially including human cells, tissues, and \u201ctherapeutic tissue engineering products\u201d may achieve status as \u201cregenerative medicine advanced therapies\u201d and be eligible for certain expedited pathways at the FDA for approval, including focused and expedited FDA review, acceptance of retrospective data in lieu of some clinical study requirements, and other measures (48).

Reducing pursuit of drugs that prove in late phase of development to have intolerable human toxicity is an important step in meeting those goals. In addition, accurately identifying agents that are human safe but currently fail animal testing will likely increase potential effective therapeutics in human disease. Although alternatives to animal research, such as cell and tissue platforms, computational in silico modeling, 3D tissue platforms and OC research have shown great promise in facilitating drug development while decreasing time and expense, they have yet to make significant inroads as replacements for preclinical animal testing. Although both the United States and European Union have recognized the value of pursuing alternative methods of research, such methods still await wider regulatory acceptance to replace animal testing in drug approval processes.",
