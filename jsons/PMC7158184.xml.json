Thorough control of the whole-plant operations, including regular and sufficient cleaning and precise control of the delays in the use of easily spoiled materials, is of great importance (Blanco, 2003). Some conceptual tools to make running practices systematic and more controllable include for example good manufacturing practice and hazard analysis critical control points analysis. Basically these systems were developed for other purposes, but their principles and those of other quality-system-based approaches, can contribute to better process hygiene. This is because control of microorganisms is connected to the overall operational practices in the mill. One should also remember that the design of the equipment in mill will have important consequences in terms of microbiology (Blanco et al., 1996). Good housekeeping includes:\u2022Controlling the contaminants entering the process\u2022Performing regular boilouts of pipelines and tanks\n",

Even the best biocide program will be stressed to maintain microbial control of the process without the execution of good housekeeping practices. According to Woodward (2009), basic housekeeping starts with the standard \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d rule. To avoid long storage times, this should be basic rule for all the containers, particularly for the chemicals because they might be stored by the machine for weeks. The hoses should also be washed when filling the tanks and containers. Other good housekeeping practices include: cleaning tanks on a routine basis, sufficient agitation and recirculation, and at least annual system-wide boilouts. If the time and temperature in boilouts are limited, using some special chemicals or enzymes could be taken into consideration (Woodward, 2009). To some extent, good housekeeping can also be automated (Kiuru, 2011). On-line cleaning can be applied to essentially any position in the papermaking process. An electric-driven water pump can be used that uses the cleanest return water available from the process. The commodity items are the spray nozzles and the joint piping connections permitting ease of piping travel through elevation and direction changes to continuously clean, for example, the entire wire channel with a single flow. Parks (2007) has reported that this type of automated mechanical cleaning\u2022Reduces manual cleaning\u2022Reduces paper quality issues like spots and tears\u2022Reduces need for unexplained, unplanned refeed and restart exercises\u2022Reduces waste amount\u2022Improves paper quality\u2022Reduces biocide usage\n",

            "text": "Boilouts are widely used in the paper industry, particularly in fine paper mills (Lindvall, 2000, Kiuru, 2011). They are very effective at cleaning the internals, piping and headbox of the short whitewater circuit. Boilout emphasizes the use of high temperatures to clean papermaking equipment. Steam is mostly used for the heating of solutions used for washups of the short loop of paper machine systems, but temperatures are normally in the range of 60\u201371 \u00b0C (Guillory, 1998, Guillory and Towery, 1998). Boilout involves treatment with an alkaline detergent solution, having a pH in the range of 10\u201313. But acidic solutions may also be used depending on the nature of the deposited materials. By using enzymes capable of breaking down the binder materials in a variety of deposits, the use of high or low pH solutions can be avoided (Anstey et al., 1998a, Anstey et al., 1998b). Paper mills periodically shut down operations and clean the wetted surfaces of a paper machine, usually with an emphasis on the short-loop recirculation system and wet-press section (Glazer, 1991, Guillory, 1998, Guillory and Towery, 1998). Papermaking efficiency and product quality often suffer if too much time elapses between such cleanups (Stitt, 1997). Schwamberger and Wormsbaker (2006) report the importance of well-planned boilouts and the advantages they offer. The boilout should include careful washing of the whole system and removal of any deposits or biofilms. The chemistry should be optimized during the boilout for optimal washing and successful startup. Careful washing without considering the chemical interactions might cause many serious problems, such as excessive foaming in startup and wrong pH levels. Boilouts can significantly increase the runnability and also improve the product quality (Schwamberger and Wormsbaker, 2006).",

For effective microbiological control, bromine is always fed with chlorine, either as two separate products or synthesized as a bromo-chloro compound. Hypochlorous acid is required to oxidize the NaBr component and form the biocidal species HOBr. The biocidal efficiency of bromine is similar to that of chlorine (Kiuru, 2011). Bromine is added as a bromide salt and produced by the reaction with chlorine. NaBr must be used together with an activating agent such as chlorine gas, hypochlorite, or ozone because it is not a biocide itself.

HOBr dissociates to form H+ and OBr\u2212, but the reaction takes place at a higher pH than chlorine. A bromine solution with a pH of 8.5 will contain close to 60% HOBr, whereas a chlorine solution at the same pH would yield 10% HOCl. In many cases, a smaller dose of bromine will obtain the same microbiological control as using chlorine in a cooling tower system. Another advantage of bromine is that it reacts with ammonia and other nitrogen compounds to form bromamines that, unlike chloramines, are effective biocides. Bromine is also less corrosive than chlorine to copper alloys. Bromine reacts with iron, manganese, sulfur, and organic matter. Heat and sunlight contribute to bromine demand, but there is less stripping because of lower volatility than chlorine. Its toxicity to aquatic life and possible formation of carcinogens is similar to chlorine and has therefore led to USEPA discharge regulations. Bromine residual can be analyzed using the same N,N\u2032-diethyl-p- phenylene-diamine colorimetric method and reagents as chlorine testing as long as other oxidants are absent. Like chlorine, bromine testing should be done at the time of sampling. If a spectrophotometer does not have a bromine program, the result given on the chlorine program can be multiplied by 2.25 to obtain a bromine concentration. It is usually unnecessary to test for free bromine residuals because most combined forms of bromine, such as bromamines, are just as effective as free bromine. If testing for free bromine is required, it should be noted that full color development by the N,N\u2032-diethyl-p- phenylene-diamine method will take 2\u20133 min for stabilized bromine products instead of the directed 30 s.",

            "text": "Hercules Pulp and Paper Division has launched Spectrum\u00ae Ammonium Bromide Technology that efficiently controls microorganisms in alkaline systems without the adverse side effects associated with strong oxidizing biocides (Davis and Casni, 2003). This biocide degrades into inert compounds before effluent discharge. It is produced on the site by mixing an ammonium bromide solution with sodium hypochlorite and mill fresh water. Dedicated blending and dosing effluent ensures safe, consistent production of the biocide. Table 8.3\nshows the benefits of the new ammonium bromide-based biocide. This biocide is produced onsite using designated dosing equipment. The dosing equipment blends the ammonium bromide solution with sodium hypochlorite and mill freshwater under required reaction conditions to assure 100% conversion of the components. The dosing equipment also strictly controls the reaction to ensure that only the new biocide is produced. The major features and benefits of the dosing system are presented in Table 8.4\n. Commercial applications have verified the effectiveness of the new biocide at controlling microbial populations. The following case histories highlight some of the key benefits of this technology, which include reduced wet-end deposition, reduced breaks, and reduced papermaking additive usage. A mill producing printing and writing grades from 100% deinked pulp suffered from severe wet-end breaks because of microbiological deposition. To control this deposition, various biocides were dosed to multiple points as follows: sodium hypochlorite in the pulp chest and clear filtrate; HOBr in the short-loop whitewater; several organic biocides in thick-stock feed points; and a biodispersant in the silo. Even with extensive biocide usage, the machine experienced one to two costly breaks per day. An evaluation of the new biocide was recommended to alleviate this problem. Originally, biocide treatments were to be replaced by the new biocide in a stepwise fashion during the first 2 months of the evaluation. Within the first week of startup, the following benefits were observed with the new biocide:\u2022Total aerobic counts and bioactivity, as measured by ATP, were reduced by more than 99%.\u2022Alkyl ketene dimer sizing usage was reduced >15%.\u2022The number of breaks declined from one to two breaks per day to only one break in the entire first week of treatment.\n",

Its original program used an organic biocide to the silo (headbox loop) and broke chest of the machine. The amount of deposition on the machine was measured by an automatic online system based on weight of deposition on a stainless steel coupon. The new biocide replaced the organic biocide program at a similar cost. Shortly after startup of the new program, the total bacterial counts dropped from 10,000,000 to 1000 colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL). Furthermore, the amount of deposition, as measured by the on-line system, was reduced dramatically between boilouts (Figure 8.1\n).

Over the past several years, a number of oxidant products have become available in the market (Bruce, 2003, Thomas, 1999). These products consist of halogens, bromine and/or chlorine, combined with an organic or inorganic carrier. One major advantage to combining the halogen is that it can often reduce the negative effect of the oxidant while maintaining its biocidal properties. The objective of combining a halogen with another molecule is to make halogen less aggressive but still biocidal. Bleach or chlorine gas with ammonia was mixed in the 1930s and 1940s to make chlorammonia for microbiological control in papermaking. Even though chloramine treatment was found to be more effective than chlorine, the chemistry was abandoned. The reasons for abandoning chloramine treatment were increased corrosion and increased microbiological activity resulting from the ammonia, which is a good source of nitrogen for bacteria. Later, bleach in combination with sulfamic acid (chlorosulfamate), was recommended as a biocide with low reactivity to process equipment and chemistries but the product was not successful because of the weak biocidal activity of chlorosulfamate.

This combination includes 1-bromo-3-chlor-5,5-dimethyhydantoin, 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, and 1,3-dichloro-5-ethyl-5-methylhydantoin. This combination of hydantoins is referred as BrMEH, for bromine methylethylhydantoin. Knapick et al. (2003) found that BrMEH increases whitewater efficacy in comparison to other oxidizing alternatives. BrMEH is rapidly converted to residual nonhalogenated hydantoin and a halide ion salt. Testing has also indicated that BrMEH hydrolyzes completely in water. Other halohydantoins follow similar pathways, and their degradation products are of a similar low toxicity. BrMEH is easier to handle than liquid oxidative biocides and does not require as much labor. An extensive study of a mid-Atlantic tissue mill resulted in several process recommendations, including an extended BrMEH trial. These trials showed that BrMEH effectively controlled aerobic and sulfate-reducing bacteria and maintained machine cleanliness and product quality. The improved effectiveness of the hydantoins can be explained by the formation of a moderately bound chlorohydantoin species in equilibrium with biocidally active hypochlorite. This equilibrium stabilizes active chlorine in a relatively unreacted combined form, thus releasing biocidally active hypochlorite on demand. So, active halogen lifetime is increased and biocidal efficacy is enhanced. This phenomenon accounts for the superior field results of the product where other inorganic and organic oxidants have not performed well. When the binding affinity of halogen is increased, halogen activity and release is further reduced, but biocide efficacy is also reduced because the release of the active hypochlorite is greatly inhibited. Thus, hydantoins provide an optimum balance of reactivity reduction and hypochlorite release, resulting in a very effective water system biocide for the paper industry. Also, the potential for total organic halogens to find their way into the effluent is reduced because the requirement for applied halogen is reduced. The possibility that the finished paper product will be affected is greatly reduced because less oxidant is used and there is less potential for system metals to corrode. The reduction in corrosion potential decreases any potential effect on the Yankee dryer coating and allows the biocide to be used closer to the wet-end of the machine. The environmental fate of any biocide is a main consideration of any biocide program. A study of papermaking biocides gave halohydantoins a favorable environmental profile. This conclusion was based on the rapid detoxification of active halogen species and the low toxicity of the unhalogenated residuals.",

The optimal pH is between pH 6.0 and pH 10.0 and is generally more effective against microorganisms at pH above 8.0 than chlorine (Knapp and Bettisti, 2001). Chlorine dioxide is converted to chlorite, the predominant end-product (50\u201370%), and to chlorate and chloride in water (Baribeau et al., 2002). The major advantage of using chlorine dioxide is that it reacts less with ammonia as compared with chlorine. Though chlorine dioxide is the strong oxidizing agent, it is not very effective against established biofilms. For example, Jang et al. (2006) reported that when chlorine dioxide used at a concentration of 25 ppm, it failed to remove a biofilm thicker than 100 \u03bcm. Chlorine dioxide is used as a cellulose bleaching agent, for water disinfection at paper manufacturing plants public, and in water treatment facilities. Production of chlorine dioxide onsite can be carried out with Eka chlorine dioxide PurateR technology by Eka Chemicals Systems. Chlorine dioxide is produced from sodium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide, and sulfuric acid in Eka\u2019s SVP-PureR generator (Koepenick, 2010). Chlorine dioxide provides broad-spectrum kill of microorganisms. Processing equipment can be kept free of slime buildups by the fast killing rates of chlorine dioxide. Slime control program using chlorine dioxide improves the quality of paper products by reducing defects such as specks, spots, and holes in the sheet. This reduces sheet breaks and avoids the subsequent production losses. Chlorine dioxide can be used for controlling odors. Chemical spot testing for chlorine dioxide at various points in the system is easily done and can be used to make adjustments in the treatment program to make up for demand changes. This allows slime control by chemical control. Most mills alternately apply several types of biocides to avoid developing resistance by certain troublesome microorganisms to a single product. This possibility is avoided with oxidizing type of chemical. It functions well over a broad pH range. This is important for the mills that operate paper machine at different pH levels, because of the different paper grades produced or because sizing changes have raised the pH in the papermaking processes. The performance of chlorine and some nonoxidizing biocides drop off in alkaline pH environment, but chlorine dioxide does not. The effective dosages of chlorine dioxide are usually low, making chlorine dioxide programs cost competitive with other biocides. Low dosage rates can result in cost reduction for effective slime control and significantly reduce the potential harmful effects to the environment from the mill effluent water. The MD Pap\u00e9is\u2019 Santista mill, located in Cubat\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, decided to switch from a monochloramine-based system. The mill produces 60,000 tons per year of printing and writing grades and flexible packaging. Because monochloramine is a persistent chemical and can be harmful to waste treatment, MD Pap\u00e9is Santista began looking for a way to reduce the toxicity of their effluent. Purate provided the level of treatment efficiency desired without the persistency problems in the effluent, and also helped with paper machine runnability.",

This is because it is difficult to inactivate bacterial spores, particularly the genus Bacillus, which survives the extreme temperatures of the dryers in the papermaking process. Chlorine dioxide has been found to be a very effective sporicide in food-grade paper applications (Bendt, 1985, Conkey, 1981) in potable water applications (Ridenour et al., 1949; Sokolova et al., 1969), and in some food processing applications (Foegeding et al., 1986, Ito and Seeger, 1980). Unlike chlorine, chlorine dioxide is relatively nonreactive with most of the organics found in alkaline whitewater. As a result, a large portion of the chlorine dioxide fed will be available for disinfection. Thus the bacterial activity can be effectively reduced to almost any desired level by controlling the chlorine dioxide feed rate. A summary of the important benefits of chlorine dioxide is presented in Table 8.10\n.",

            "text": "Hydrogen peroxide is much less effective biocide than, for example, hypochlorite. Its chemical formula is H2O2 and its structure is shown in Figure 8.7\n. The bactericidal action of hydrogen peroxide is due to generation of hydroxyl radicals that oxidize thiol groups in proteins (Russell, 1998, Denyer and Stewart, 1998). Hydrogen peroxide produces oxygen from solution when reacted with organic matter. It reacts with most materials including metals and so it is quickly consumed by organics and nonorganics. Some commercial products have additives that increase bactericidal action of the biocides. At low temperatures or low concentrations, hydrogen peroxide is not a powerful biocide but it exhibits a strong biostatic effect inhibiting growth of many microbiological species (Chiari et al., 1990, Rantakokko et al., 1994, Schirch et al., 1993). The biocidal preparation is found to increase with both temperature and concentration. It has been used to control anaerobic bacteria in the paper industry, as a sterilant for aseptic packaging for milk and also fruit juice containers. Hydrogen peroxide is often used in conjunction with peroxyacetic acid (PAA), existing in an equilibrium mixture designed to specific formulations to achieve the greatest effectiveness for paper industry applications. Hydrogen peroxide generates hydroxyl radicals (HO\u2022), which is highly reactive and responsible for the antimicrobial action. It can attack membrane lipids, DNA, and other cell components. Catalase and peroxidase are enzymes produced in respiring cells to protect the cells from damage by steady-state levels of metabolically generated hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is effective between pH 2 and 10 and active against spores.",

It has a strong pungent acetic acid odor (acetic acid [AA] is the principal component of vinegar) and has an acidic pH of less than 2. It is soluble in water in all proportions and in polar organic solvents. However, it is slightly soluble in aromatic solvents. Peracetic acid or PAA is the peroxide of AA. Figure 8.8\nshows the structure of PAA. It has long been used in sewage treatment and in the sugar, dairy, and brewery industries as well as for medical sterilization for renal dialysis machines. PAA is used widely for cold sterilization and disinfection. It is also effective for both drinking and wastewater treatment (Kitis, 2004, Rossi et al., 2007). PAA-based biocides are found to be effective for controlling microbial populations in papermaking process waters (Bjorklund, 2000, Maunuksela, 1995). Because PAA is used rather fast and does not leave any toxic residue, it can be an attractive biocide for mills that produce food-grade paperboard. Peracetic acid is rapidly tidal at low concentrations against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, molds, and algae under a wide variety of conditions. It is also effective against anaerobic and spore-forming bacteria. Peracetic acid is affective at killing biofilm microorganisms at low concentrations and short contact times. Unlike a number of other biocides, the biocidal activity of peracetic acid is not affected by pH or water hardness and biocidal activity is retained even in the presence of organic matter. For these reasons, peracetic acid is well-suited as a biocide in industrial cooling water and papermaking systems. Peracetic acid is compatible with additives commonly used in these systems. Although peracetic acid is a potent biocide, it is unique in that it does not produce toxic byproducts and its decomposition products, AA, water and oxygen, are innocuous and environmentally acceptable. PAA has a broad spectrum of activity over a wide temperature range. Once reacted, it breaks down to nontoxic end-products\u2014water, oxygen, and AA\u2014which itself breaks down to carbon dioxide and water.",

There is also no known immunity to PAA, provided sufficiently high active levels are maintained. It is nonfoaming and can reduce chemical and biological oxygen demand in effluent. The active ingredients can be easily monitored using proprietary electro-optical measuring equipment, giving parts per million concentrations within seconds. The chemistry does have some limitations. It is found to be not much effective on organisms with thicker cell walls such as filamentous bacteria and molds. Certain system chemistries\u2014for instance, high levels of carbonate filler\u2014can mean that higher dosage rates are required to effect control. The control program has been used successfully in UK\u2019s Paper New Thames Mill, Kent (Bhattacharjee and Farr, 1977). There are several different commercially available PAA-based biocides. It has rapid bactericidal activity against different vegetative organisms and spores (Baldry, 1983). The bactericidal effectiveness of PAA is affected by temperature and pH (Cords and Dychdala, 1993). The presence of organic compounds adversely affects the biocidal activity of PAA. PAA is effective over a broad pH range (pH 1.0\u20138.0); however, the optimum antimicrobial activity occurs in acidic environment. The activity of PAA is found to decrease at pH higher than 8 (Cords and Dychdala, 1993, Sanchez-Ruiz et al., 1995). AA present in high amount in PAA-based biocides may have a negative effect on the pH stability of a papermaking process. Another disadvantage associated with PAA disinfection is the increase of organic content and the potential microbial regrowth because of remaining AA (Kitis, 2004).",

            "text": "Ozone (O3) trioxygen, is a triatomic molecule, consisting of three oxygen atoms (Figure 8.9\n) It acts as an oxidizer, much like chlorine or bromine, improving system turbidity and removing bioslime (Table 8.12\n). The biocide action of ozone is a result of its reaction with the double bonds of fatty acids of the bacterial cell wall and membrane. The application of ozone results in a change in bacterial cell permeability and a leakage of cells contents into solution. The action of ozone in water is immediate and after performing its action it reverts back to oxygen. It decomposes in solution producing hydroperoxyl, hydroxyl, and superoxide radicals. The reactivity of ozone is due to strong oxidizing power of these free radicals (Kim et al., 1999). The main advantage of ozone use consists of its superiority compared to chlorine for the main reasons that it has been reported to be 1.5 times stronger than chlorine and it is acting 3000 times faster than chlorine without producing harmful decomposition products. In 1995, ozone was declared as generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bottled drinking water. Moreover, its generally recognized as safe status was extended to food processing by experts some years later (Voidarou et al., 2007). Because of its high reactivity, it is required only in low concentrations. Similarly to all oxidizing biocides, ozone has some disadvantages like instability and high corrosion potential. Some factors such as temperature and pH affect solubility, stability, and reactivity of ozone. The pH significantly affects the stability of ozone in aqueous solutions. Stability of ozone in solution is the greatest at pH 5.0 and decreases as pH is increased (Kim et al., 1999). In the paper industry, ozone is mainly used for pulp bleaching, water disinfection, and as a final treatment of effluents. Korhonen and Tuhkanen (2000) found ozone to be very effective for controlling bacteria in recycled whitewater. Ozone was studied as a biocide to control microbial growth in a printing paper machine whitewater system from Stora Enso newsprint Varkaus Mills in Finland. Two samples (a cloudy discharge from a disc-filter save-all and a clear filtrate from the same save-all) were treated by ozone dose; about 80% of the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in the disc save-all cloudy discharge and 90% removal of the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in the clear filtrate were destroyed (Voidarou et al., 2007). The use of ultrasound with ozone is found to be of great interest because the use of ultrasound in conjunction with biocides offers a greener alternative. Ultrasound is presently employed in several industries such as surface cleaning, medical scanning ultrasonic therapy, food and beverage technology, materials science nanosynthesis (nanotechnology), mineral processing, industrial welding, nondestructive testing, and environmental. Though the energies required for ultrasonic disinfection alone are high there is now commercial equipment available using lower powers that is often combined with ozone (Eadaoin and Timothy, 2008). The ozonation costs are US$ 1\u20132/kg O3 produced, depending on if the ozone equipment already exists. Then, a 99% destruction of the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria will cost from US$ 0.04\u20130.15 per m3 whitewater treated. Ozone also functions as a micro flocculating agent to \u201cpolish\u201d the water and improve clarity.",

Ozone cannot be stored or transported like other industrial gases because it rapidly decays into diatomic oxygen and should be produced onsite. Because ozone is a short-lived gas molecule that is formed when oxygen reacts with other oxygen molecules to form three parts oxygen (O3). This reaction requires energy. Ozone generators form ozone by passing dry, clean air through a high-voltage electric discharge (i.e., corona discharge), creating ozone at a concentration of approximately 1%. The corona discharge method is the most common type of ozone generation; these units usually work by means of a corona discharge tube. They are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone. Temperature and humidity plays a large role in how much ozone is being produced. The important parameter affecting ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The ozone synthesis is better when the water is cooler. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration, but the lower the net ozone produced. In typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is released as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.\n",

It is extensively used as an antimicrobial agent in a variety of applications such as in cooling water systems, paper-pulp industry, oil field operation, leather tanning industry, poultry industry, cosmetic field, microbiological field, food industry, and the medical area. The extensive use of this biocide is due to being noncorrosive to stainless steel, soft metals, rubber, and glass (Banner, 1995, Herbert, 1995, Lutey, 1995, Walsh et al., 1999). Glutaraldehyde is useful in preventing the formation of slime in Lutey, 1980 all the areas of the papermaking process (Purvis and Tomlin, 1991). Glutaraldehyde is an amber-colored liquid usually supplied in solutions of acidic pH. As with other aldehydes, the two aldehyde groups react readily under suitable conditions, particularly with proteins. It is miscible with water and having melting and boiling points \u221214 \u00b0C and 187 \u00b0C, respectively. It is found to be readily biodegradable and is effective against the aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms including sulfate-reducing bacteria. It is found to be fully compatible with commonly used wet-end additives and significantly reduces the level of microorganisms in both acidic and alkaline systems. It shows more than 90% reduction at 25 ppm and essentially complete kill at 50 ppm in ASTM (American Society for Microbiology) paper slimicide test. It considerably reduces the amount of sulfate-reducing bacteria present in the solutions at any time point Figure 8.10\nshows structure of glutaraldehyde. It achieves its biocidal activity by cross-linking the outer proteinaceous layers of the cell in such a way that cellular permeability is changed. The bacterial cell is unable to undertake most, if not all, of its essential functions. The ability of the outer covering of the cell to transport nutrients to the cell and to remove waste products from the cell is hampered and cell death results (Russell and Chopra, 1996, Simons et al., 2000). The cell walls of all living organisms contain free amine groups (lysine and arginine) that serve as the reactive site for glutaraldehyde attack. Complex cross-links are formed on the cell surface, and as essential cellular functions are disrupted, the cell dies. With increasing pH, more reactive sites for glutaraldehyde attack are formed, and the cidal reaction accelerates. Although glutaraldehyde kills most quickly at alkaline pH levels, it is still effective under acidic conditions. It is also effective against anaerobic bacteria, notably sulfate-reducing bacteria, because it is not inactivated by sulfide.",

            "text": "Glutaraldehyde was first synthesized by Harries and Tank in 1908 (Gorman and Scott, 1980). As with other aldehydes, the two aldehyde groups react readily under suitable conditions, particularly with proteins (Richards and Knowles, 1968). The ratio of monomer to polymer and type of polymer present has been the subjects of numerous publications. The dialdehyde existed as a monomer (25%) in equilibrium with the cyclic hemiacetal. It has been reported that the presence of free aldehyde groups is essential for biocidal activity. From an H-NMR study on commercial (aqueous) acid glutaraldehyde, it has been suggested that the protein cross-linking reactions are possible because of \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes (Richards and Knowles, 1968). The pure acid glutaraldehyde underwent very rapid hydration on dissolution in water to give three hydrates in equilibrium. An acetal-like polymer similar to that suggested by Aso and Aito was also shown to exist in acid solution (Aso and Aito, 1962). A scheme depicting glutaraldehyde polymerization in acid and alkaline solutions has been suggested by Gorman and Scott (1980). An increase in temperature produces more free aldehyde in acid solution, whereas in alkaline solution loss of reactive aldehyde groups is possible. Progression to the higher polymeric form could occur with increased time and pH because it has been shown that there is an extensive loss of aldehyde groups from polymerization in alkaline solution (Bowes and Cater, 1966). Therefore loss of reactive aldehyde groups could be responsible for the rapid loss of biocidal activity of alkaline solutions in storage. Increased biocidal activity in heated acid solutions can also be explained by displacement of equilibrium toward the monomer. Glutaraldehyde is an agent that acts as a protein cross-linker and is used as a biocide. It is able to bridge amino acids or H- bonds, thereby modifying the folding of the proteins and stopping its activity (Gorman and Scott, 1980). It is thus likely to react and be consumed by wet-end additives that carry an amine function (Wolf and Sterner, 1972). The dialdehyde reacted with 30\u201350% of the E-NH2 groups in the isolated peptidoglycan and it was proposed that two tripeptide side chains could be joined when free and amino groups are available (Hughes and Thurman, 1970). Cell wall peptidoglycan (murein, glycopeptide, mucopeptide) contains many chemical groupings capable of reaction with glutaraldehyde. The effect of lysozyme on the isolated wall peptidoglycan of Bacillus subtilis, was examined and it was found that although splitting of the lysozyme-sensitive bond occurred, glutaraldehyde-treated peptidoglycan was less sensitive than the untreated polymer to lysis by lysozyme (Hughes and Thurman, 1970). The effect of glutaraldehyde on different microorganisms is presented in Table 8.13\n. The stability of glutaraldehyde is affected basically by pH and temperature as shown:\u2022Glutaraldehyde can be used very effectively up to pH 10. At very high pH (>10.5) glutaraldehyde is still effective, but a shortened half-life may necessitate more frequent dosing.\u2022Glutaraldehyde is efficacious through a broad temperature range; at higher temperatures glutaraldehyde works faster, although its half-life can be shortened.\u2022The optimum pH for glutaraldehyde, in terms of rate of efficacy and half-life, is in the range of 7\u20139, which encompasses most use conditions.\u2022Adverse storage conditions may impact product quality in a nonhazardous way.\n",

            "text": "Glutaraldehyde-based formulations are extremely effective in controlling the growth of unwanted organisms. However, the minimal impact of glutaraldehyde on the natural environment is just as important as its biocidal efficacy. Several studies have been conducted to determine the acute toxicity of glutaraldehyde to aquatic organisms, both fresh water and marine/estuarine. In acute toxicity studies of glutaraldehyde in three aquatic species, the no observable effect concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 0.029 mg/L (algae) to 9\u201324 mg/L (Daphnia magna) in freshwater and marine studies, respectively. In chronic studies, the no observable effect concentrations ranged from 0.31 mg/L (algae) to 4.25 mg/L (Daphnia magna). This suggests that the environmental toxicity of glutaraldehyde does not increase significantly with repeated exposure. Glutaraldehyde belongs to the aldehydes chemical class whose properties clearly differ. Unlike formaldehyde, all available long-term animal data clearly reveal that glutaraldehyde is not carcinogenic. Several regulatory and advisory agencies have set occupational exposure limits for glutaraldehyde. Users should ensure that any exposure does not exceed the limit applicable. However, a limit as such does not prevent the use of glutaraldehyde-based products in any application. Use as a high-level disinfectant on medical devices has led to cases of eye, nasal, respiratory, and skin irritation and dermal sensitization basically because of poor control of exposure following spills. In some cases, occupational asthma has been reported, although the available data do not suggest that exposure up to the limit value induces such effects. Products based on glutaraldehyde are effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and a variety of viruses (including infectious bursal disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, hog cholera virus, human corona virus, Newcastle disease virus, avian reovirus, avian rotavirus, and strains of avian influenza virus). This wide spectrum of biocidal activity supports the many diverse applications. Table 8.15, Table 8.16\nshow features and limitation of glutaraldehyde, respectively.",

The compound in the solid state can be stored for 3 years and longer, and it is not affected by factors such as daylight, air humidity (up to relative humidity of 90%), and temperature (up to 45 \u00b0C) (Legin, 1996, Bryce et al., 1978). However, aqueous solutions of Bronopol are stable only in the cold, provided that the acidity is sufficiently high. An increase in the pH and temperature leads to decomposition of the compound. This is due to the splitting of formaldehyde. The initial process in the decomposition of Bronopol appears to be a retro-aldol reaction with the liberation of formaldehyde and the formation of bromo nitroethanol (Bryce et al., 1978). Bromonitro ethanol itself is significantly less stable than Bronopol and in the range of conditions investigated its maximal concentration did not exceed 0.5% of the initial Bronopol concentrations. Simultaneously a second-order reaction involving Bronopol and formaldehyde occurs to give 2-hydroxymethyl-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol. The antimicrobial activity of Bronopol is mostly because of the presence of electron deficient bromine atoms in the molecules, which shows oxidation properties rather than the ability to liberate formaldehyde (Legin, 1996). The mechanism of the antimicrobial effect of Bronopol consists of the cross-linking of sulfohydride groups of dehydrogenase enzymes occurring on the surface of microbial cells. The disulfide bridges block microbial metabolism.",

The main benefits of Myacide AS in the paper industry are its established performance as a slimicide active ingredient in mill process water and as an effective preservative for mill additives. The ideal physical and microbiological properties of Bronopol place it in a new generation of products, which can be seen replacing older chemistries.

It is a high-performance paper mill slimicide with a broad spectrum of activity that can cope with the rapid changes in microbial flora that occur in different papermaking systems. It penetrates and kills microorganisms in the biofilm and is not inactivated by the high level of suspended organic solids found in paper mill water. It also provides cost-effective microbial control. Kathon WT has amber-gold color, is completely soluble in water, and has a mild odor and specific gravity of 1.32 at 20 \u00b0C. Kathon is stable over a wide range of conditions found in cooling water and paper mill applications. It is an extremely effective, broad-spectrum microbiocide that causes an immediate inhibition of growth on coming in contact with a microorganism. It is effective over a wide pH range and is therefore ideal for use in the alkaline conditions that exist in multicycle cooling towers and modern papermaking (Divkovic et al., 2005). It is found to be compatible with chlorine, corrosion, and scale inhibitors and most anionic, cationic, and nonionic formulations at normal-use levels. It causes immediate inhibition of growth on coming in contact with a microorganism. The growth inhibition rapidly becomes irreversible and results in cell death. Even before death occurs, the Kathon-treated organism is unable to synthesize degradative enzymes or the exopolymers that facilitate adhesion and biofilm formation. Growth inhibition rapidly becomes irreversible and results in cell death when essential proteins are progressively oxidized. It controls the wide variety of algae, bacteria, and fungi found in industrial water systems. Such a broad-spectrum product reduces inventory and handling costs, lowers operator training expenses, and reduces the risk of dosing error. Effective control of such a wide variety of microorganisms at levels as low as 1 ppm active ingredient provides an unrivalled and cost-effective treatment. It readily penetrates the surface of adhering biofilm to give effective control of sessile microorganisms. When diluted below use concentrations, it is readily biodegradable. Their decomposition does not lead to the presence of chlorinated organics in the environment. Table 8.19, Table 8.20\nshow features and benefits of CMIT/MIT.",

It can also be added to finished products as a preservative enhancer. It controls algae, bacteria, and fungal growth. DBNPA has low vapor pressure and high water solubility that makes the compound be retained mainly in the water phase. But, DBNPA has a short half-life and is rapidly degraded in water by hydrolysis. DBNPA is not an oxidizing biocide and is bromine releasing. DBNPA does act similarly to the typical halogen biocides. The liquid formulated DBNPA is an oxidizer, and the solid formulated DBNPA as a tablet is not an oxidizer. The liquid formulation is oxidizing because of the HOBr in the formulation. DBNPA readily degrades under alkaline conditions. It is sensitive to ultraviolet light and nucleophilic substances. It is uncharged and non\u2013surface-active and it seems unlikely to interact with wet-end additives (Huber et al., 2010). DBNPA dissolves in water, forming a relatively stable solution in an acid pH range. Its unusual solubility and stability in polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight, 200 Da) make this glycol a preferred solvent. Aqueous solutions hydrolyze under alkaline conditions with the rate of decomposition increasing with the alkalinity. However, the rate of hydrolysis is not fast enough to interfere with the antimicrobial activity of fresh, alkaline (pH 7\u20139.5) solutions (Wolf and Sterner, 1972).",

            "text": "Although DBNPA is compatible with many chemical classes, including oxidizing agents, it will react readily with nucleophilic agents and sulfur-containing reducing agents. The facile reaction of DBNPA with sulfur-containing nucleophiles common to microorganisms, such as glutathione or cysteine, is the basis of its mode of antimicrobial action. DBNPA is therefore not a typical oxidizing or halogen-releasing biocide. Unlike other thiol-reactive biocides, its action is such that thiol-based amino acids, like cysteine, are oxidized beyond the formation of disulfide species. This reaction irreversibly disrupts the function of cell-surface components, interrupting transport across cell membranes and inhibiting key biological functions. DBNPA degrades rapidly by both nucleophilic and hydrolytic pathways to relatively nontoxic products. The rate of hydrolysis of DBNPA is strongly pH-dependent: at pH 6.0 and 25 \u00b0C, the DBNPA molecule has a half-life of 155 h (about 6.5 days), but at pH 8.0 and 25 \u00b0C, its half-life is about 2 h. The ultimate degradation products of DBNPA are ammonia, carbon dioxide, and bromide ion. The mechanism for the environmental degradation of a DBNPA has been described by Exner et al. (1973). There are two competing pathways:1.DBNPA \u223c DBAM (dibromoacetamide)2.DBNPA \u223c CAM (cyanoacetamide).\n",

OIT exhibits excellent fungistatic and fungicidal activity against fungi, including yeasts, mold, and gram-positive bacteria, and limited activity against gram-negative bacteria. OIT also belongs to the isothiazolinone group which in general all are electrophilic molecules containing an activated N-S bond that enables them to react with nucleophilic cell entities thus exerting an antimicrobial action (Alaxender, 2002). Figure 8.17\nshows the structure of OIT. This biocide makes use of a two-step mechanism that involves rapid growth inhibition leading to a loss of cell viability. Growth inhibition is the result of rapid disruption of the central metabolic pathways of the cell by inhibition of several specific enzymes, including dehydrogenases. The essential enzymes that are affected are associated with the nutrient metabolism, Krebs cycle, and energy generation. The main physiological activities that are rapidly inhibited in microbial cells are respiration (oxygen consumption), energy generation (ATP synthesis), and growth (assimilation). Most of these major enzymes are present in both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms, which shows the broad spectrum nature of this biocide. Inhibition of cellular activity and growth is rapid within minutes. However, cell death (cidal activity) is observed after several hours of contact. Generally, the higher the concentration of biocide, the shorter the contact time needed for more complete kill. Cell death results from the progressive loss of protein thiols in the cell from one of the multiple pathways. As cell metabolism is disturbed, free radicals are produced, which also results in cell death. This exceptional mechanism results in its broad spectrum activity.\n",

This is based on the biocidal molecule tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate (THPS) (Hack et al., 1997). THPS biocides are classified by Department of Transportation as nonhazardous because they have very low acute toxicity in the environment. THPS is fully water soluble and a clear colorless liquid. It is found to be highly effective against sulfate-reducing bacteria having an odor that resembles aldehyde and is stable for 14 days at temperatures 21\u201354 \u00b0C (WHO, 2002). THPS is a quaternary phosphonium salt having the structure shown in Figure 8.18\n(Haack and Downward, 1997). Aqueous solutions of THPS are acidic (pH 3.2) because of the small dissociation of THPS to tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine, P(CH2OH)3, formaldehyde, and sulfuric acid (Thomas et al., 2007). THPS is also readily biodegradable and has no potential to bioaccumulate. Another environmental benefit is that THPS is rapidly oxidized in the environment to trishydroxymethylphosphine oxide (THPO), which has a very low aquatic toxicity and is not considered to present an environmental hazard (Haack and Downward, 1997). The following data show the low toxicity of THPO.\u2022Rainbow trout, 96 h LC50: >5000 mg/L\u2022Daphnia magna, 48 h EC50: >1000 mg/L\u2022Skeletonema costatum EC50: 2090 mg/L\n",

Its common name is 2-bromo-4\u2032-hydroxyacetophenone and its chemical name is ethanone 2-bromo-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl). There are three products\u2014Busan 90, 93, and 1130\u2014containing the active ingredient bromohydroxyacetophenone. Buckman Laboratories, Inc., manufactures these three products. They are used in the control of slime-forming bacteria, deterioration/spoilage bacteria, fungi, and slime-forming fungi in paper mills and water systems. They have also been used to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi that cause the microbiological degradation of papermaking chemicals. It is a reddish brown, viscous, odorless liquid, having a boiling point of 139.1 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b0C at 737.9 mm Hg and solubility 0.248 \u00b1 0.07 g/100 mL water. It is found to be stable under all storage conditions. At a pH 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0, BHAP has a hydrolytic half-life of 272, 250, and 173 h, respectively. Figure 8.21\nshows the structure of BHAP. It is useful for situations requiring continuous or semicontinuous dosing at low levels, such as once-through cooling systems, where the dose rate is only 1\u20133 mg/L. It is supplied as a 30% active biocide. The dose rate for recirculating cooling systems is typically 10\u201320 mg/L, but could possibly reach up to 80 mg/L in fouled systems. Considerably higher dose rates are required for algal and fungal slimes. Because BHAP is not pH-dependent, it is effective at high pH levels. However, BHAP has a relatively long half-life, typically 175\u2013250 h, which may affect its potential for cooling system bleed discharge. Other organobromine group products with similar biocidal mechanisms include: bisbromo acetyl butene and \u03b2-bromo-\u03b2-nitrostyrene. An example of BHAP is BRM10 from Buckman Laboratories, Inc. (Frayne, 2001). BHAP photodegrades in water with a half-life of less than 2 days. Also, BHAP\u2019s half-life in aerobic aquatic environments is 2.5 days.",

MBT is a yellow to light orange solid that melts at 105\u2013107 \u00b0C. It has limited solubility in water (<1 mg/mL) but is soluble in organic solvents and therefore it is usually formulated with dispersants or supplied as a water slurry. Its molecular formula is CH2(SCN)2 and molecular weight is 130. Figure 8.22\nshows the structure of MBT. It maintains long-term effects and is applicable to broad pH value and temperature ranges. MBT is pH-sensitive and rapidly hydrolyzes in the pH range above 8.0. For this reason, it is not recommended for use in systems where the recirculating water pH generally exceeds 8.0 (Mass-Diepeveen and Van Leeuwen, 1988). Not much is known about the mechanism of MBT responsible for biocidal activity. It has been suggested that it inhibits cell respiration. Because it is a competitive microbiocide, it inactivates the electron transfer cytochromes of the microorganisms. The thiocyanate fragment of the methylene ester of the thiocyanic acid reacts to blocking the transfer of electrons in the microorganism, which results in cell death.",

About 75% of the cells were retained by the fibers. The effect of glutaraldehyde, another traditional biocide in pulp mills, was also tested and it was concluded that this biocide did not modify the surface charge of the bacteria. Contrary to the glutaraldehyde, the carbamate-based biocide modifies the surface electrical charge of the microbial cells, making them more positive. Therefore, this biocide may promote cell aggregation when the electrostatic repulsion becomes low or nonexistent (i.e., when the zeta potential is close to zero). This happens for carbamate concentrations of 100 mg/L and 200 mg/L, when the pH is 5.9, and for concentrations of 200 mg/L, when the pH is 6.7.",

It is produced by the reaction of two chemicals\u2014an inorganic compound with no inherent antimicrobial activity and sodium hypochlorite. Among organic slime control agents commonly used in paper mills, current methods require raising dosing concentrations to enhance antimicrobial activity, bringing to the fore the issue of proportionate increases in environmental loads. Comparatively, newly released Fuzzicide is an innovative slime control agent with high resistance to bacteria, fungi, and yeast, assuring eco-friendliness and safety. This agent has been verified to have no effect on papermaking chemicals such as dyes. Kurita Water Industries has taken the initiative in incorporating Fuzzicide into approximately 40 machines centering on fine paper for 5 years since receiving its dealership in Japan from AY Labs, an Israeli venture firm. The benefits of Fuzzicide have since been substantiated. The company further aims to expand the use of Fuzzicide in neutral-pH paper machines\u2014such as paperboard and newsprint machines that require slime control because of changes in paper types\u2014in addition to fine paper machines. Fuzzicide features include availability in intended water systems with high organic matter content, low metal corrosivity, and no generation of toxic waste such as trihalomethane. Fuzzicide is not supplied in containers because of easy degradation and a lack of long-term stability. It requires the installation of dedicated dosing equipment near the intended system, and the agent can be added while being constantly generated in the equipment. The dosing equipment is outfitted with a computer to control the proportions and reactions of the above two chemicals when forming Fuzzicide and to add it in appropriate quantities. Sodium hypochlorite is commonly used for sterilizing tap water. However, it tends to assign priority to dissolved organic matter rather than reacting to bacteria. Thus it is seldom used in papermaking, a process with significant dissolved organic matter that decreases antimicrobial activity. Table 8.29\nshows key features of Fuzzicide.",

Some of the more common industrial enzymes are alpha amylases, cellulases, lipases, proteases, and xylanases. Enzymes contain polypeptide chains consisting of amino acids. The structure and function of enzymes are determined by the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chains. The molecular weights of enzymes range from around 10,000 to a million or more. The most important property of enzymes is their specificity. Enzymes can catalyze one particular reaction on a particular substrate without affecting other elements. The enzyme specificity can be pictured like a lock and key where polypeptide chains fold and arrange in such a way as to form a unique binding active site for the substrate. The chemical reaction occurs at this active site.",

The cells are directly exposed to the biocides once the slime gets dissolved. Biocides are now effective at lower concentration. The slime is a fructan polymer and is broken down to monomers by carbohydrase type of enzymes. Enzymes involved in the degradations of fructans are hydrolases and transferases:Hydrolases: These are hydrolytic enzymes. According to their mode of action, they are either endo- or exo-enzymes. These enzymes produce oligofructans or only fructose.Transferases: These enzymes split off fructose dimers and give rise to difructose anhydride by simultaneous transfructosylation.\n",

This creates a protective niche that completely covers the cells. It eventually grows into the large, complex slime deposits by trapping fines, fibers, mat-forming organisms, and general debris that create productivity problems for paper mills.

The first approach involves directly identifying the polysaccharides present in the slime and looking for specific enzymes able to degrade them. An example of this case is levan, which is produced by several species of Bacillus and Pseudomonas bacteria that can grow in paper machines, especially those manufacturing fine paper, where the level of inhibiting compounds is low. The enzyme levan hydrolase hydrolyzes levan to low-molecular-weight polymers that are water-soluble and therefore clean the slime out of the system. Another case where it was applied is a family of products called Darazyme, developed by Grace Dearborn\u2019s group; this work was based on the preliminary identification of slime components and the subsequent application of specific enzymes or combination of enzymes depending on the polysaccharides found (Bajpai, 1999). The other approach is indirectly testing to identify enzymes that show activity on the biofilm by studying their effects on slime development. The specificity in the way enzymes interact with the biofilm makes this a complex technique, being somewhat difficult to identify enzymes that are effective against different types of slimes. According to Simoes et al. (2010), formulations containing several types of enzymes seem to be fundamental when it comes to applying this slime control approach successfully.",

Personal safety is greatly enhanced through the use of an enzyme product rather than conventional toxic biocides. The enzyme is nontoxic, does not release dangerous fumes and is not corrosive and also does not require any special handling. Spills can be flushed away with water.

Eight hydrolytic enzymes were screened on a 24-h multispecies biofilm. The enzymes were tested at various concentrations and contact durations. Glycosidases and lipases were inefficient or only slightly efficient for biofilm reduction, whereas proteases were more efficient: after treatment for 24 h with pepsin, Alcalase1, or Savinase1, the removal exceeded 80%.

Further, it was shown that on application of enzyme (0.10 kg/metric ton) on machines producing printing grade paper, the biocide concentration could be reduced from 0.15 to 0.02 kg/metric ton (Ferris et al., 1989). The amount of biocide was reduced to \u223c15% of what had been used before using the enzyme. Hatcher (1983) also achieved a similar level of reduction in biocide concentration in the whitewater system of a paper mill when an enzyme preparation was used. Patterson (1986) has reported that with the use of enzyme, the concentration of biocide may be reduced by 50% and slime breaks are reduced from three per day to three per month. Colasurdo and Wilton (1988) reported that with the use of an enzyme preparation at Sonoco Products Co., Hartsville, Georgia, the slime breaks were almost eliminated which resulted in increased productivity. The Levanase enzyme produced by Rhodotorula sp. has been found to reduce the required biocide concentration by 25% without negatively affecting the paper properties (Chaudhary, 1992, Chaudhary et al., 1998).

In addition to these, many microorganisms have capsules, slime layers, or other surface components, which are polysaccharides or proteins attached to the outside of the rigid layer conferring additional rigidity and/or protection. There are enzymes which will attack all of these polymers. The use of lytic enzymes with gluconase and protease activity in paper machine process water to kill microorganisms causing precipitates and/or forming slime and/or adversely affecting product quality, has been promoted. Enzymatic dispersion of biological slimes has been studied with pentosanase-hexosanase enzyme, Rhodozyme HP-150. This enzyme is especially effective in treating industrial waters used in the operation of cooling towers to disperse slimes and slime-forming masses within such waters to prevent the deposit of such slimes on the heat exchange surfaces of cooling towers and surface associated with such units.

This helped the mill to substantially reduce breaks and increase efficiency (Daignault and Jones, 2003). A coordinated chemical deposit-control program was supplemented by cleaning programs focused on difficult to reach areas that were suspected as possible contributors to breaks. The big breakthrough in starch system cleaning has been the introduction of enzyme-cleaning products. The enzyme used is amylase, an enzyme that breaks down the starch deposits and thus allowing them to be easily washed away. The enzyme is so powerful and persistent that it is necessary to deactivate the enzyme with hypochlorite or peroxide after the cleaning. The Dryden mill has used the starch enzymatic cleaner for the past few years with very good success. In the early enzymatic starch cleanings, the system was found to have leaks after the enzyme boilout. Starch deposits that had plugged the leaks were completely cleaned away. In addition to the enzymatic cleaning, regular caustic cleanings of the system were done. These were found to be effective but do not match the enzyme cleaning. The size press area itself is cleaned with hot water.",

Many microbial EPS have different substituent groups as ketal-linked pyruvate or ester-linked acetyl groups. The removal of acyl groups, especially the acetate, can significantly affect the physical properties of polysaccharides. The removal of one of the substituents such as the acetyl group, in particular the acetate, influences the physical properties of EPS (Sutherland, 1999). Several fungi can degrade complex plant cell-wall material, by secreting a large variety of enzymes. This versatility makes commercial polysaccharide-degrading enzyme mixtures have a widespread use in multiple fields, such as fruit processing (McKay, 1993) or wastewater treatment (Wesenberg et al., 2003). They could also be used to degrade bacterial biofilm matrices or prevent and control the formation of biofilm in the piping system of the paper mill wastewater. Because of the EPS heterogeneity, a mixture of enzymes might be necessary for efficient biofilm degradation.",

The use of biodispersants offers an ecologically attractive method of controlling slime in the pulp and paper industry. They eliminate or reduce the needs for biocides (Anstey et al., 1998a, Blankenburg and Schulte, 1997, Blankenburg and Schulte, 1999, Gould, 1998, Gould, 2001, Pauly, 2001, Robertson and Taylor, 1994, Saner, 1998, Stenqvist, 1992, Van Haute, 1997a, Van Haute, 1997b, Van Haute, 1999; Weisshuhn et al., 2000, Wright, 1997, Schenker, 1996). These are nonbiocidal surface-active agents that penetrate and loosen the biopolymer matrix. This not only aids in sloughing the biofilm, but will also expose the microorganisms to the microbicides. They can be continuously applied or periodically slug-dosed. Because these products effectively mobilize solids, they can cause clogging in downstream and down-gradient locations, and this potential must be taken into account when designing proper application. Biodispersants are particularly effective when dealing with systems that have a high total organic carbon loading and a tendency to foul. These products are typically fed in slug additions before microbicide feed. Low-level continuous feed may also be effective. However, in some cases, this may not be as effective because it may not reach a certain threshold amount required to produce the desired effect. Developments in biodispersant technology are making this approach more effective and popular than ever before. This technology is based on nonionic polymers, which are nontoxic, nonfoaming, colorless, and free of organic solvents. Because of their nonionic character, they will not increase the system anionicity and also not interfere with other papermaking chemicals. Table 8.38\nshows biodispersants used in the paper industry.",

The increased negative charge of the particle surfaces increases the electrostatic potential energy barrier and reduces contact with the surfaces because the bacteria are negatively charged. To be effective, the amount of dispersant must be sufficient to overpower any coagulants that may be present (e.g., aluminum sulfate, high-density cationic polymers). There are some problems with the use of dispersants. These products effectively mobilize solids but they can cause clogging in downstream and down-gradient locations; therefore, this potential must be considered when designing an appropriate application that will not lead to an uncontrolled accumulation of dispersed materials in a paper production system. Particularly cationic retention aids tend to be deactivated by dispersants. However, in some cases, dispersants have helped papermakers overcome specific deposit problems (Hubbe et al., 2006). Under some circumstances, slime deposits may be responsible for up to 70% of all breakages, blockages, and pump failures in pulp and papers mills (Safade, 1988).",

The recommended program involved the continuous application of a biodispersant while reducing feeding frequency of the same nonoxidizing biocides used previously by the mill. After optimization, the mill reported reduced nonoxidizing biocide use by 60%, fewer deposits on the paper machine, sheet breaks reduced from an average of 5.8\u20132.6 breaks per day, and deposit control program costs reduced by 20%. This demonstrates that selected dispersants can significantly reduce the amount of nonoxidizing biocides needed to obtain good slime control in a cost-effective manner. Poor microbial deposit control is the main cause of poor paper machine runnability and loss of efficiency. The use of new monitoring tools allows mills to optimize slime control programs to achieve the best performance in a cost-effective way. The use of traditional toxic nonoxidizing biocides can be significantly reduced by the use of new nonhalogenated oxidants in combination with new nontoxic deposit control agents. An optimized microbial deposit control program can give papermakers a high return on investment, because program costs can be offset by improved runnability, decreased rejects, and reduced biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the final effluent.",

Buckman researchers, microbiologists, and application engineers have developed the Neoteric Product Line for deposit control. Neoteric biodispersants are new, specially designed Buckman products for use in preventing and slowing biofilm development in paper machine systems without sacrificing papermaking operations. These products can penetrate existing biofilms, loosening and dispensing them, which allows biocides to penetrate and reach the organisms, and were developed with safety and the environment in mind (Van Haute, 1999, Hart, 2001, Koopmans and de Vreese, 2002). The programs have been successfully used in acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions and in the manufacture of all types of paper, paperboard, tissue, and toweling (Van Haute, 1999, Van Haute, 2000). Buckman reports that several paper machines in Europe use Neoterics in their short circulation loop, with Busperse and Buzyme. Neoteric programs are designed to increase the effectiveness of traditional biocides, reducing and in some cases eliminating the use of biocides in wet-end. Neoteric programs consist of dispersants, enzymes, and potentiators added to the wet-end of the paper machine:\u2022Neoteric dispersants are a select group of chemicals that prevent agglomeration and deposition on machine surfaces of common deposit causing components in the paper machine furnish.\u2022Neoteric enzymes are biodegradable and nonbiocidal, have relatively low level of toxicity to test animals, and are Food and Drug Administration\u2013allowed. These enzymes include amylase enzymes and protease enzymes in a formulation that attacks starches and proteins.\u2022Potentiators are nonbiocidal products that increase the performance of biocide. These products allow the use of less organic biocide while still achieving the same effect as the original dosage of biocide. The potentiators simply lower the effective concentration of biocide required for a given application. These products, when used alone, do not reduce or slow microbial growth or metabolism.\n",

The question arises about how this is possible given the specific mode of action of enzymes. This appears logical, if the majority of the machine system deposits are microbiological slime. A protease breaks down these deposits. But in a system that has deposits containing various fiber, fillers, and hydrolyzed additives, how does the protease enzyme work? Actually, most deposits in the paper machine system have microbiological growth in, on, and around the deposit. When the enzyme breaks down this matrix, the deposit sloughs off and is carried away in the boilout solution. This is based on the ability of bioengineered enzymatics to attack specific deposits by eating the organisms that compose them, making them easy to rinse away. There are certain pH-neutral additives that can be added to help in penetrating, breaking down, and removing deposits that are nonmicrobiological in nature. These additives in fact help the protease-based enzyme product enter into the deposit where microbiological growth is helping to anchor and hold a deposit together.

This is based on the introduction of a consortium of bacteria commercially available in freeze-dried or liquid form. The bacteria are pregrown before inoculation of the circuit water, and the amount added is calculated on the basis of total organic carbon present. The additives may be introduced along with the bacteria, thus favoring their growth. These additives include tensides to avoid the adhesion of bacteria, lignosulfonate to increase the nutrients, and enzymes to catalyze the breakdown of organic substances. It has been also suggested aeration of the circulating water with oxygen or air or the addition of oxygen releasing compounds such as hydrogen peroxide. The invention is not limited to bacteria, but the fungi alone or the mixture of fungi and bacteria can also be used. The patent describes an indiscriminate use of bacteria and fungi, of which the mixed culture of freeze-dried bacteria used contains genera associated with slime formation in pulp and paper mills but also contains such genera undesirable for paper and board intended to come into contact with food stuffs. Plant-scale trials showed that the addition of the selected microbes to the circulating water reduced the buildup of slime on solid surfaces and in the liquid phase.",

Sulfosuccinates, a family of molecules, are very effective in inhibiting deposit formation (Davis et al., 1999, Scharpf, 1998, Schenker et al., 1998). An exclusively designed sulfosuccinate molecule is found to act at an earlier stage than biodispersants and enzymes in the inhibition of biofilm deposit formation. The mechanism of biofilm inhibitors differs from that of biodispersants and enzymes in that bacterial attachment and biofilm formation is prevented by hindering the formation of a concentrated extracellular EPS layer around a bacterial cell. Bacteria lacking EPS have less capability to permanently attach to surfaces, cannot easily protect themselves from the harmful effects of microbicides, and do not provide \u201cglue\u201d to hold wet-end deposits together. Thus, in the idealized model of biofilm formation, sulfosuccinate works in stage 2, actually preventing the bacteria from forming an intact EPS matrix. The cells are then only loosely associated with the surface. Because of the absence of the concentrated EPS layer around the bacterial cell, sulfosuccinates are described as biofilm inhibitors to distinguish them from microbicides, biodispersants, and enzyme.",

Before running any of the field trials, lithium tracer studies were conducted from which the system cycle-up was determined and the product application rates were accordingly determined. The control data from a European trial location reflect deposition on a machine with a conventional proprietary microbicide (dodecylguanidine hydrochloride and methylene bis (thiocyanate) and biodispersant in the short loop whitewater and a conventional proprietary microbicide (Bronopol and quaternary ammonium chloride) in the save-all. The control consisted of the paper machine running with a commercial biocide program. The treated system received a program consisting of the biofilm inhibitor. This conventional program was found to be effective at keeping the machine clean and providing the mill with a desired 4-week interval between boilouts. The microbicide and biodispersant feeding the short loop were completely replaced with a biofilm inhibitor program on an equal cost per ton basis. A side-stream monitoring device was used to measure visual appearance of the biofilm and the growth of certain biofilm constituents over a 2-week period. Both measurements showed a significant decrease in biofilm growth with the biofilm inhibitor program. Over an 11-month period, testing on this fine paper machine trial indicated that the biofilm inhibitor program reduced the number of breaks by 40%. This provided the mill with a 103% return on investment. Also, the mill totally removed microbicides from the short loop of the machine, thus providing a much safer program. Results showed that, for the specific paper machine, continuous feed is preferential over semicontinuous. The trial consisted of various production runs with boilouts in between runs.",

(2003) reported that N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) may be an interesting candidate for use as an agent to reduce and prevent biofilm formation on stainless steel surfaces in environments typical of paper mill plants. Using 10 different bacterial strains isolated from a paper mill, the researchers found that the mode of action of NAC is chemical as well as biological in the case of bacterial adhesion to stainless steel surfaces. The initial adhesion of bacteria is dependent on the wettability of the substratum. NAC was shown to bind to stainless steel, increasing the wettability of the surface. Moreover, NAC decreased bacterial adhesion and even detached bacteria that were adhering to stainless steel surfaces. Growth of various bacteria, as monocultures or in a multispecies community, was inhibited at different concentrations of NAC. No detectable degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) by NAC was found, showing that NAC reduced the production of EPS, in most bacteria tested, even at concentrations at which growth was not affected. Altogether, the presence of NAC changes the texture of the biofilm formed and makes NAC an interesting candidate for use as a general inhibitor of formation of bacterial biofilms on stainless steel surfaces.",

The microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements.

            "text": "Phages are ubiquitous in nature. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and may provide a natural, highly specific, nontoxic, feasible approach for controlling several microorganisms involved in biofilm formation (Kudva et al., 1999, Duckworth, 1976). Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages (phages) are hypothesized to be the predominant lifeform in the biosphere, clearly outnumbering their host bacterium. Bacterial viruses were discovered about 100 years ago (d\u2019H\u00e9relle, 1922; Hauduroy, 1925) and their discovery is attributed to F\u00e9lix d\u2019H\u00e9relle, a French-Canadian microbiologist and Frederick Twort, an English bacteriologist (Twort, 1915, d'H\u00e9relle, 1917). d\u2019H\u00e9relle named these viruses as \u201cbacteriophages\u201d from the words \u201cbacteria\u201d and \u201cphagein,\u201d which in Greek means to eat or devour. d\u2019H\u00e9relle performed extensive trials in humans and animals (Barrow and Soothill, 1997) and tried to shed a light on their nature and ability to function as therapeutic agents (d'H\u00e9relle, 1917, d'H\u00e9relle, 1922). He isolated bacteriophages for a number of bacterial hosts causing diseases. The phage products were produced in large scale at d\u2019H\u00e9relle\u2019s laboratory in Paris (today known as L\u2019Or\u00e9al), and by several pharmaceutical companies (Eli Lilly & Co., Parke-Davis, Squibb & Sons, and Swan-Myers division of Abbott Laboratories, etc.) (Straub and Applebaum, 1993, Sulakvelidze et al., 2001, Summers, 1999). Twenty years after the official finding of phages, the first antibiotic, penicillin, was discovered. This fact, allied with some early clinical failures (Eaton and Bayne-Jones, 1934) and theoretical concerns did not continue with the phage therapy in the United States and most of the Western Europe. However, research and therapeutic use of phages continued in the Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union (Alisky et al., 1998, Chanishvili et al., 2002, Slopek et al., 1987, Weber-Dabrowska et al., 2000). In these countries, phages continued to be regarded as a good treatment method against a wide range of bacterial infectious diseases (Sulakvelidze et al., 2001, Ho, 2001).",

The infection of biofilm cells by phages is extremely conditioned by their chemical composition and the environmental factors, such as temperature, growth stage, media, and phage concentration (Chaignon et al., 2007, Sillankorva et al., 2004). The major advantage of using phages in combating bacteria is their bactericidal (killing) nature, selectivity, and nontoxicity to man and the environment. The main drawback is that the phages have to be isolated for each harmful bacterium, the type of which may vary between paper mills. When phages make contact with biofilms, further interactions take place, depending on the susceptibility of the biofilm cells to the phage and to the accessibility of the receptor sites. The integrity of the biofilm may be quickly destroyed if the phage also contains polysaccharide-degrading enzymes or if significant cell lysis is affected by the phage. These microbes are noted for their high activity in the presence of host cells and selective lytic action. But, the industrial application of this technique has been slow. Viruses lack an independent metabolism and multiply only inside the living cells, using the metabolic machinery of the host cells. A bacteriophage can propagate only by coming into contact with its specific host bacterium. When this happens, the phage lyses the bacterium completely. Some of the bacteriophages that attack E. coli (\u03c8, \u03bb, and T-4 phage) are very well known for their extensive contribution to development in molecular biology. The bacteriophage contains an icosahedral head of 50\u2013100 nm in diameter, a long tail of about 100 nm in length with or without a sheath around it and six tail fibers at the end of its tail. The bacteriophage contains only protein with nucleic acid as gene. The bacteriophage selectively attacks its particular host bacterium. The gene of the bacteriophage is placed into the host bacterium, where it multiplies. The host cells also begin to produce the specific protein which constitutes the bacteriophage. A large number of bacteriophages are formed in the host cell, when the phages are released from the host, the cycle begins once again. The bacteriophage formed in the host cell has the same properties and morphology as the original. The reproduced phages thus can constantly lyse the same host bacteria. The number of bacteriophages formed after one lytic cycle is called \u201cburst size\u201d and the time required for the cycle is called latent period. These values are reported for evaluating the activity of bacteriophage.",

Phages and bacteria can coexist symbiotically within biofilms, suggesting that they would make poor tools for the control of biofilm formation. Combinations of phage enzymes and disinfectants have been recommended as possible control strategies under certain conditions (Tait et al., 2002) with the phage added before addition of disinfectant being more effective than either of these alone.

When K. pneumoniae was dosed with phage at 3-h intervals, bacterial growth was no more restricted than when the culture was injected only at the beginning of the test.

This enzymatic phage was found to have the ability to attack the bacterial cells in the biofilm and the biofilm matrix, considerably reducing the biofilm cell counts; more than 99.9% of removal was achieved. Hughes et al. (1998a) working on the control of E. agglomerans biofilms by the use of phages observed that the cells were killed and the biofilms were degraded by the bacteriophage. The phage then lysed the biofilm cells and the polysaccharide polymerase enzyme degraded the EPS and caused biofilm to slough off. Sillankorva et al. (2004) used bacteriophages to remove P. fluorescens cells, showing that phages were effective in the removal of biofilms in the early stage of development and 5-day-old biofilms under optimal conditions; up to 80% biofilm removal was obtained. Hanlon et al. (2001) have reported that in P. aeruginosa biofilms the bacteriophage migration through the biofilms is facilitated by the reduction in alginate viscosity. This phenomenon is related to the exopolysaccharide degradation by enzymes produced by the bacterial host. Hibma et al. (1997) reported that a bacteriophage (L. monocytogenes phage ATCC 23074-B1) was used successfully in L. monocytogenes biofilm inactivation.

The redox potential of these solution is between +800 and +1200 mV; pH ranges from 2 to 5 (Cloete et al., 2009, Thorn et al., 2012). Electrochemically produced biocides can be obtained using other salts, such as potassium chloride and magnesium chloride. These solutions have been extensively used in many industries. The primary oxidant is chlorine, produced from electrolysis of the salts in the aqueous media (Thorn et al., 2012, Buck et al., 2002). The next candidate used to make ECAS in the halogen series is bromine. It is an effective biological control agent. It rapidly degrades to harmless bromide. Therefore, it is not a persistent pollutant. Bromine is produced by electrolysis of a nonhazardous aqueous solution of NaBr and chloride. The electrolytic bromine can completely replace hazardous/toxic chemical biocides for the control of microorganisms in cooling towers (Timothy, 2007). Anaerobic bacteria are more sensitive to oxidizing compounds in comparison to aerobic bacteria, and therefore electrochemically generated biocides are powerful antianaerobes. Bacterial spores are highly resistant to many traditional organic biocides, whereas these ECAS have been effective against a number of pathogens, including Bacillus atrophaeus, B. cereus, Bacillus anthracis, human norovirus, hepatitis B virus, HIV, Aspergillus flavus, C. albicans, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile, Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, and staphylococcal enterotoxin (Venczel et al., 1997, Shetty et al., 1999, Kim et al., 2000, Rogers et al., 2006, Park et al., 2007, Tagawa et al., 2000, Xiong et al., 2010, Morita et al., 2000, Zeng et al., 2011, Buck et al., 2002, Holcomb et al., 2005, Robinson et al., 2010, Raad and Sherertz, 2001).",

The results showed a faster degradation at the higher temperature than at the lower temperature, with a concomitant decline in bactericidal capacity, whereas the pH did not change. The use of high concentrations of biocides can be avoided by adding greener biocide enhancers, such as ethylenediamine disuccinate (EDDS); its usage in the laboratory allowed the application of less glutaraldehyde to the test biofilms formed by sulfate-reducing bacteria. EDDS, which is a biodegradable chelator, increases the effectiveness of glutaraldehyde in its treatment of sulfate-reducing bacteria biofilms. This concept was initially used by Raad and Sherertz (2001) to treat biofilms on catheters (Raad et al., 2003, Raad et al., 2007) but with the new concept of green materials, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was a noncompatible molecule because of its slow biodegradability, and it was replaced with environmentally compatible chelating agents. The activity of biocides such as THPS can be increased by the use of EDDS.",

This composite strategy allowed the production of a tunable system to control the release rate and extend its effectiveness to 45 days during an artificially generated rain test. This approach appears promising for the prolonged protection of different construction materials and waterborne paints. Routine coatings last for an average of half a year or a maximum of 2 years, whereas the desired service life in buildings is at least 10 years. The effect of a controlled-release system on biocide concentrations over time was studied. Increasing the dose of a biocide was found to result in a minor prolongation of protection, but increased in-house environmental pollution. To meet the challenges to material performance and environmental safety, such durable composite materials are a beam of hope for safer green applications (BPD, Directive 98/8/EC, 2012).",

When biofilms on photocatalytic TiO2 surfaces, submerged in water, were exposed to 20 W h m\u22122 of 360 nm light, both kinds of adhesion threads were completely destroyed and the D. geothermalis cells were extensively removed (from >107 down to below 106 cells cm\u22122).

When D. geothermalis biofilms grown for 24 h in simulated paper machine water were exposed to cathodic or cathodically weighted pulsed polarization at least 60% (P\n < 0.05) of the biofilms were removed from stainless steel (AISI 316L). Biofilm removal by 25 ppm (effective substances 5\u201325 ppm) of oxidizing biocides (bromochloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, 2,2-dibromo-2-cyanoacetamide, peracetic acid) increased to 70% when combined with cathodically weighted pulsed polarization. Using a novel instrument that allows real-time detection of reactive oxygen species, these researchers showed that the polarization program is effective in antifouling generated reactive oxygen species in a pulsed manner on the steel surface. They suggested that the observed added value of oxidative biocides combined with polarization depended on reactive oxygen species. This suggestion was supported by the finding that a reductive biocide, methylene bisthiocyanate, counteracted the antifouling effect of polarization (Table 8.39\n).\n",
