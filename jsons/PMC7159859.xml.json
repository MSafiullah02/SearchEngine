            "text": "\n1.Training of medical and paramedical staffs regarding early recognition of COVID-19 infection, disinfection measures for facilities and medical equipment and training for PPE are essential.2.Myocardial injury and acute myocarditis due to COVID19 infection can mimic ACS. Raised troponin results are very common specially with high sensitivity cardiac troponin assays. So routinely ordered increased troponin values may not be helpful in diagnosis of ACS during COVID 19 infection.8\n3.Rapid antibody detection test can reduce the time delay, and may be helpful for quick triage of COVID-19 positivity in ACS.4.Patients may be diagnosed as having this infection during the course of hospital stay. Hence collaboration with ID Department on regular basis is important. Regular assessment of risk benefit ratio for intervention and ongoing medical treatment is mandatory.5.In every city, at least a few CCUs (coronary care units) and CCLs should be developed in hospitals caring for COVID-19 positive cases, where patients from other hospitals may be transferred.6.Delayed presenters of STEMI will significantly increase due to lack of proper transport, lack of routine medical services, reluctance to attend hospital in present conditions and fear of getting infection from healthcare systems. Even in a hospital equipped with CCL, stipulated \u2018door-to-balloon time\u2019 for primary PCI may not be maintained due to delay in ruling out the COVID-19 diagnosis. So thrombolysis is preferred even in hospitals with CCL facilities.7.Coagulation parameters are deranged during severe COVID infection, which need to kept in mind before giving thrombolysis or antiplatelets.5 Close monitoring of bleeding parameters should be done in such situations.8.Anti-viral drugs: Ribavirin has no direct toxicity over CV system. Lopinavir/ritonavir may result in QT and PR interval prolongation, mainly in those having baseline abnormality (long QT) or those who are at risk for conduction abnormalities including those taking other QT prolonging drugs.9\n9.Anticoagulant dosing: Ribavirin has variable effects on warfarin dosing.10 Lopinavir/ritonavir may need dose reductions or avoidance of CYP3A4 mediated drugs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban.11\n10.Lopinavir/ritonavir, through CYP3A4 inhibition, causes increased serum concentrations of ticagrelor.12 Hence, concomitant use of ticagrelor should be discouraged due to excess bleeding risk as has been done in USA and Canada.3 Conversely, clopidogrel may not provide sufficient platelet inhibition during concomitant administration of lopinavir/ritonavir but this was not the case with prasugrel.13\n,\n14 In case prasugrel cannot be used, testing guided approach with platelet function assays is strongly recommended.11.Co-administration of lopinavir/ritonavir with statins can result in myopathy due to elevated statin levels. Lovastatin and simvastatin are contraindicated for co-administration with lopinavir/ritonavir for the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, should be administered at the lowest possible dose.3\n12.Being a QT prolonger, cautious use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)15 is needed in ACS patients. Same is true for azithromycin and its combination with HCQ. Careful use with more frequent assessment of QT interval is needed for anti-arrhythmic drugs known to cause QT prolongation, especially amiodarone.13.Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI)/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) are usually used in post ACS setting. It is recommended to continue use of ACEI/ARB in the treatment of HTN, HF, post MI and other scenarios during COVID-19 pandemic16 although there is a debate regarding their use during this pandemic, as they increase the ACE-2 levels.14.\nFollow up with telephonic or telehealth care systems should be extended for all stable patients to minimize hospital visits and if possible avoid them. As per new Indian guidelines,17 medical practitioners are entitled to provide telemedicine consultation to patients while upholding the same professional and ethical norms and standards as applicable to traditional in-person care. All practitioners are also encouraged to get familiar with these guidelines by online programs developed and made available by the Board of Governors of MCI.\n",

This has overwhelmed the medical infrastructure worldwide and compelled to make modifications in the management of some commonly occurring diseases. A more conservative approach in the management of ACS is mandated by certain compulsions. Setting up of a few dedicated CCUs and CCLs in hospitals taking care of COVID-19 positive cases in every city is the need of the hour to combat the pandemic if it propagates in our country. This pandemic has asked for several modifications like modification in our lifestyle, modification in our social behavior, modification in our clinical practice. We have to live with these modifications till we can get rid of this menace.",
