Then the individual can begin with symptoms in 3 days or he can continue asymptomatic, but probably infectious during two weeks. It is not known actually the number of asymptomatic people, but it will be probably bigger that the number of people with symptoms. About 75% of persons with symptoms have just light symptoms that last for two weeks and after that they became recovered. The other 25% get sever symptoms after a first period of 7-9 days with light symptoms. A 15% of these patients with severe symptoms die in 4-6 days, while the other 85% will recover after a period of 18-24 days. This disease can be described by the SEIAHRCD model defined before.
