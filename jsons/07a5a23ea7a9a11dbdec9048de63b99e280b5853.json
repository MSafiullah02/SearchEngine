In addition, we need to develop tools that can measure/monitor T-cell and B-cell responses to know how our immune system is responding to this deleterious virus. However, little information is currently available about the immune target epitopes of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to induce host immune responses. Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity (<0.5%-and 2%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identified 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8% of the Japanese population. The findings in the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available vaccine epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide the useful information for monitoring T-cell responses.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of several severe pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was found in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province of China. Shortly thereafter, a novel Betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as a causative microbial agent to cause severe acute respiratory disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID- 19) as public health emergency of international concern and put in place a series of temporary recommendations on January 30. The current outbreak of COVID-19 has nearly 3 million confirmed cases worldwide with more than 200,000 deaths, as of April 27, 2020, according to the WHO. The genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 were reported to consist of~30,000 nucleotides with high sequence similarities to Betacoronavirus, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; 79%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; 50%) [1] [2] [3] . The SARS-CoV-2 genome, like other coronaviruses, encodes for multiple structural and nonstructural proteins. The structural proteins include spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), and the nonstructural proteins include open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, and ORF10. The previous studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has putatively a similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage [4, 5] .",

Two epitopes in S protein, S268-277, and S448-457, covered more than 70% of Japanese. HLAoligomers with these peptides are also useful for monitoring the CD8 + T-cell responses in the patients and silentlyinfected individuals. All replicating viruses, including coronavirus, accumulate some mutations that persist due to natural selection, and these mutations contribute to an escape from immune responses. Thus, we finally investigated mutation rates in 6421 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from patients/individuals in four different regions, including Asia, North America, Europe, and Oceania, and identified a total of 156 amino acid mutations, which were observed at more than 0.5% frequencies (Fig. 2 , Table 4 and Supplementary Table 7 ). ORF1ab P4715L and S D614G, which were previously reported [15, 16] , were commonly found in all the four regions, although the frequencies of ORF1ab 4715L and S 614G types were significantly lower in Asian countries than other countries (15.4% vs. 52.6-73.7%; P = 3.81 \u00d7 10 \u2212125 ).

            "text": "To control the current COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the second pandemic in the near future, the development of new drugs and vaccines, and the establishment of tools investigating the immune responses in patients or silently-infected individuals are urgent issues. Especially, effective vaccination or immunotherapy could play a significant role in suppressing the spread of the virus. Since antibodies recognize cell surface proteins, the targets of antibody-based vaccine were limited. Upon viral infection, the viral proteins express in the infected cells and are processed into small peptides by proteasomes. These peptides are then presented by HLA molecules on the surface of the infected cells and recognized by T cells through their T cell receptors. Thus, the potential T cell epitopes can be derived from any of the viral structural and nonstructural Table 1) proteins. In this study, using the bioinformatics tools, we comprehensively screened potential SARS-CoV-2-derived, HLA-class I-and II-presented epitopes for 43 HLA alleles that are common in the Japanese population, and identified 2013 and 1399 epitopes, respectively. 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes are considered to be common between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Table 2 ). We found that four epitopes, S1060-1068, S1220-1229, N222-230, and N315-324 of SARS-CoV-2, have exactly same sequences reported as immunogenic SARS-CoV-derived epitopes for HLA-A*02:01, that correspond to S1042-1050, S1203-1211, N223-231, and N317-325 of SARS-CoV, respectively [17, 18] . Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-derived S1060-1068 epitope is also predicted as high affinity epitopes for HLA-A*02:06 (belonging to the same HLA-A*02 family), HLA-B*52:01, and HLA-C*12:02. In the Japanese population, HLA-A*24:02 is the most common HLA-A molecule with the allelic frequency of 37.8% (implying that 61.3% of the Japanese have at least one HLA-A*24:02 allele), followed by 12.3% and 9.6% of HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*02:06, respectively. Two epitopes in ORF1ab, ORF1ab2168-2176, and ORF1ab4089-4098, latter of which is conserved in SARS-CoV, were predicted to have the strong affinity to HLA-A*24:02 as well as HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-A*02:06. Based on their allele frequency, these epitopes could cover 83.8% of the Japanese individuals. Since no mutation was identified in these epitope sequences we identified, these potential candidate epitopes could lead to the contribution to development of rationally designed epitope-based peptide vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. If these epitopes are immunogenic, we are able to use HLA-oligomer with each of these peptides for monitoring T-cell responses in patients and were compared with the reference protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2_Wuhan-Hu-1 [1] . 156 amino acid mutations, which were observed at more than 0.5% frequencies in at least one region, were plotted silently-infected individuals. In addition, several reports have suggested that a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine release syndrome [19, 20] . These HLA-oligomers might be useful to predict and monitor acute T-cell responses in COVID-19 patients who cause these lifethreatning symptoms.",
