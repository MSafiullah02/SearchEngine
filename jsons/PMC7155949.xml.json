As of 15 March 2020, 22,512 cases have been reported in Italy, 2,026 (9%) of which are healthcare workers.1 Unfortunately, rates for intensive care unit admission with the need for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are approximately 5% in patients with COVID-19.2 Given the rapid growth of this outbreak and the need to minimize morbidity in healthcare workers, it is paramount that healthcare professionals be familiar with both the definition of a high-risk exposure and the correct donning and doffing procedures for the protective personal equipment (PPE) needed during the care of these patients.",

Ensuring that the most distal part of the gown\u2019s sleeve is covered snugly by the glove is paramount to preventing hand and forearm contamination (Figure A).Time management: PPE should be donned properly; this should be done carefully and never be rushed.

Removal of the first glove is usually easier than the second one. When removing the second glove, ensure that there is as minimal contact as possible between the sleeve of the gloved hand and the un-gloved hand/ fingers (Figure B). Avoid snapping of gloves.5.Removing gown: The gown is the second most contaminated PPE element. Ensure that bare hands do not touch the front of the gown when removing (e.g., reaching back to untie a reusable gown). A surgical gown that can be pulled off without having to untie it may confer additional safety.6.Removing mask: Always avoid touching the front of the mask (and/or face shield) with the hands when removing. Maintaining tension on the inferior strap is useful for preventing snapping while removing (Figure C).7.We recommend hand hygiene with alcohol-based sanitizers be performed for 15\u201320 sec after each article of PPE is doffed to ensure complete removal of virus contamination from hands.\n",
