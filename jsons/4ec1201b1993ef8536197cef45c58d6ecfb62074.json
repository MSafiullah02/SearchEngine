Here we tested whether tree shrew, an emerging experimental animal domesticated from wild animal, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical signs were observed in SARS-CoV-2 inoculated tree shrews during this experiment except the increasing body temperature (above 39 ) particular in female animals during infection. Low levels of virus shedding and replication in tissues occurred in all three age groups, each of which showed his own characteristics. Histopathological examine revealed that pulmonary abnormalities were mild but the main changes although slight lesions were also observed in other tissues. In summary, tree shrew is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may not be a suitable animal for COVID-19 related researches.",

It causes a pandemic with more than three million confirmed cases and nearly 230 thousand deaths in addition to huge economic losses to the world 1 . Nevertheless, it is widely considered to be controllable according to the experiences from China and other countries. However, there are still some critical aspects that need to be further investigated in patients, such as cytokine storm, immunopathogenic damages, tropism of SARS-CoV-2, and other sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection besides bat and pangolin that are regarded as the origin of SARS-CoV-2 [2] [3] [4] . From these points of view, studies of animals become essentially important. In fact, several animal models of COVID-19 have been recently reported in murine 5 , hamster 6 , ferret 7 , and non-human primate [8] [9] [10] [11] , which recapitulate COVID-19 from different aspects. In terms of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, in addition to these experimental animals, domestic animals and pets are also investigated 12 . Cats, as a popular pet, could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their close relationship with human beings.",

Therefore, it is being developed to be an experimental animal that could be an alternative to primates in biomedical research due to its unique characteristics 16 . In fact, tree shrew has been used for several animal models of virus infections, including hepatitis B 17 , influenza virus [18] [19] [20] , and Zika virus 21 . However, Tupaia model of high pathogenic viruses has not been reported yet, including SARS-CoV-2. Several reports show that SARS-CoV-2 may originate from wild animals [2] [3] [4] . Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in tree shrews is still unknown. In this study, in order to determine the possibility of tree shrew as a COVID-19 model, we tested the susceptibility of tree shrew to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that SARS-CoV-2 had limited replication and shedding in tree shrew, and cause mild histopathology, but no typical symptom is observed in infected tree shrew as reported in COVID-19 patients.",

The lung of tree shrews in all age groups showed widened pulmonary septum, hyperemia of interstitium, airway obstruction, consolidation of lung margin, local hemorrhagic necrosis, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Inflammatory cells infiltrated into the submucosa of the trachea in the aged group. Some spleen corpuscles are in active state, and the structure of spleen corpuscles is disordered. Hyperplasia of intestinal gland was observed in the small intestine. The other tissues had certain inflammatory infiltration and massive lymphocyte aggregation (Figure 2).Overall evaluation of histopathology in tissues from all 24 tree shrews revealed that all tissues, except lung, showed only mild histological abnormality. Lung was the major organs affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild pulmonary abnormality was observed in 62.5%, intermediate abnormality in 12.5% and severe in 4.2% of 24 tree shrews. Unexpectedly, we also found some mild histopathological changes in brain, heart, liver and pancreas(Table 2).DISCUSSIONSThe announcement of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 reveals the unique relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with 2003 SARS-CoV and 2012 MERS-CoV 22 , which not only attracts great attentions but also leads to many conjectures. The main concerns are the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the natural reservoir, intermediate host, factors affecting infection and prognosis, and so on. These are actually about the sensitivity or susceptibility of host to SARS-CoV-2 infection 12 . Although the retrospective studies of COVID-19 have given us some answers 23 , further investigation also needs to be performed in various animals. So far, several animal models of COVID-19 have been reported tosuccessfully recapitulate some aspects of this disease[5][6][7][8][9][10][11] and also indicate that these experimental animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.Rhinolophus sinicus is mostly recognized as the natural host for SARS-CoV-224 .However, the intermediate host is still controversial. Nevertheless, some domestic animals and pets, including cat, can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 12 .Our previous study revealed the variable susceptibility among three species of non-human primates to SARS-CoV-2 infection 8 . Here we experimentally infected tree shrew, an emerging experimental animal genetically close to NHP14 . No typical clinical sign except the increasing body temperature was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected tree shrews, although viruses were detectable in swabs, serum samples and some of tissues. These results indicate that tree shrew may be a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been demonstrated as an essential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vertebrate animals 29 . The interaction between ACE2 and RBD domain of viral spike protein determines the susceptibility and range of host to SARS-CoV-2 infection 30 . Furthermore, distribution of ACE2 in vivo may be associated with viral pathogenesis 31 . However, no profile of ACE2 in various tissues of animal models has been reported so far. Amino acid alignment of critical domain of ACE2 binding spike protein RBD showed that there were 10 amino acid different between tree shrew and human, whereas no difference exists between rhesus monkey and human 8 . This may be one of the reasons that tree shrews are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 distribution of tissues in tree shrew is different from that reported in autopsied COVID-19 patients. For example, high copy number of viral genomic RNA was unexpectedly detected in kidney, pancreas, and spinal cord in SARS-CoV-2 infected tree shrew",
