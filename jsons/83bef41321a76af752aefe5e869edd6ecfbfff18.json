As these contacts may already self-isolate, this 415 lowers the benefits of contact tracing. 416 417 Our finding of the crucial importance of the first step of CTS, establishing a diagnosis in 418 subjects with symptoms, has important consequences. It requires an infrastructure for 419 testing, that allows subjects with symptoms to be tested, preferably, within one day of 420 symptom onset. Studies have demonstrated that viral shedding in the respiratory tract is 421 highest at the start of symptoms 25 , so early testing will also increase the sensitivity of this 422 approach. To further enhance effectiveness, as many infectious subjects need to be tested, 423 which requires a low threshold for testing. As the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are mostly 424 mild and heterogeneous, many subjects should be eligible for testing, resulting in a large 425 proportion of subjects with negative test results. Future work should determine the optimal 426 balance between the proportion of test-negatives and the effectiveness of CTS. In our 427 country, testing of ambulatory subjects is coordinated by the public health services and general practitioners. That infrastructure may introduce a considerable delay in testing.

Latent infection, infectivity during the infectious period, and daily 193 contact rates are quantified using distributions taken from published data.[20][21][22][23][24] We 194 distinguish between close contacts (e.g. household contacts, but also other high-risk 195 contacts) and casual contacts, which differ in the risk of acquiring infection from the index 196 case. Also, the time required for tracing and quarantining contacts and the coverage of 197 tracing may differ between these types of contacts and between different CTS (i.e., 198 conventional contact tracing versus mobile app supported contact tracing). Intervention 199 effectiveness is determined by the daily probability of an index case being diagnosed by 200 testing during the infectious period, and depends on various delays in the process of tracing 201 household and non-household contacts, respectively, and on the proportions of contacts 202 that can be traced and isolated (seeFigure 1). We assume that isolation is perfect, i.e. that 203 isolated persons do not transmit any longer. The model is described by a set of difference 204 equations, and allows for explicit computation of the basic reproduction number R0, the 205 effective reproduction number under social-distancing interventions Re and the effective 206 reproduction number with CTS (Rcts).

Reducing the tracing delay, i.e. shortening the time of contact tracing, may 388 further enhance the effectiveness of CTS.
