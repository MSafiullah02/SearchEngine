It is estimated that 170 million people worldwide are infected with HCV [3]. The ultimate goal of both clinical and basic HCV studies is the suppression of liver-related death caused by HCV infection. With respect to clinical studies, interferon (IFN) has played a major role in the treatment of patients with CH\u2013C. IFN therapy started with IFN monotherapy in the early 1990s, and a sustained virologic response (SVR) was obtained in about 10% of patients [4]. IFN therapy was developed by the hepatologists, and the current therapy of pegylated IFN (PEG-IFN) with ribavirin has improved the SVR to about 50% [4]. Therefore, the next stage of the therapy for CH\u2013C is to develop new anti-HCV reagents to improve the SVR.",

In 1999, Lohmann et al. [5] achieved subgenomic HCV RNA replication in a human hepatoma cell line, HuH-7. The advantages of this novel system (known as the replicon system) were that it provided not only a way to screen for anti-HCV reagents but also information about the mechanism of HCV RNA replication. This cell culture system has been further improved, and recently the complete life cycle of HCV was achieved using a genotype 2a HCV strain, JFH1 [6], [7], [8]. This newest system has extended the targets of the anti-HCV therapy to the virus infection and release.",

Chimpanzees were the only animal model in the early HCV studies [9]. However, the use of chimpanzees is limited for ethical and financial reasons. In addition to chimpanzees, a study using tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) has been reported [10]. A different approach to the study of HCV using animal models was achieved using the related GB virus B (GBV-B). GBV-B belongs to the Flaviviridae family and can be transmitted to tamarins and marmosets [11], [12]. These animal models may be valuable surrogate models for HCV study. Another approach was demonstrated in a study using urokinase plasminogen activator-severe combined immunodeficiency (uPA-SCID) mice transplanted with human hepatocytes [13]. This chimeric mouse model can support chronic HCV viremia under the circumstance without immune system. Mass screening for anti-HCV reagents using cell culture systems will become a more powerful tool when combined with small animal model systems to evaluate the antiviral effects of selected reagents before clinical trial.",

With respect to the HCV proteins, two of these, nonstructural (NS) 3-4A and NS5B, have been well-characterized as protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively [14], [15]. Several reagents have been reported to be inhibitors of NS3-4A serine protease, including SCH6 [16], [17], SCH503034 [18], VX-950 [19], [20], and BILN-2061 [21]. Valopicitabine (NM283) was reported to inhibit NS5B RdRp [22]. HCV RNA itself is also a target of antivirals, and recent RNA interference technologies using siRNA or shRNA have targeted HCV RNA [23], [24], [25]. As RdRp lacks proofreading activity, the high mutation rate of RdRp allows the virus to escape from the reagents targeting HCV proteins and HCV RNA. These anti-HCV reagent-targeting viral proteins and genome will be reviewed in another section.",

            "text": "Other targets are the cellular proteins essential for HCV RNA replication and infection. The expression of HCV proteins is thought to affect the host cells' gene expression profiles and vise versa [26]. The interaction of the specific cellular proteins with HCV proteins is essential for HCV replication (Table 1\n). Cyclosporine A (CsA) is one of the best characterized inhibitors targeting the cellular proteins required for HCV replication [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. The interaction of cyclophilin B (CyPB) with NS5B is required for HCV RNA replication [28]. CsA inhibits HCV RNA replication by interrupting the interaction between NS5B and CyPB. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has also been reported to be an essential cellular protein for HCV RNA replication [37], [38], [39]. Knockdown or inhibition of HSP90 has been shown to result in the anti-HCV activity in cell culture and in uPA-SCID mouse systems [37]. FKBP8, a member of the FK506-binding protein family, specifically interacts with NS5A and forms a complex with HSP90 [38]. The La autoantigen (La) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) are also candidate cellular proteins for the inhibition of HCV RNA replication [40], although no inhibitors for these proteins have been reported to date. Thus, inhibition of the metabolism has recently been reported as a target of the new antivirals. Here, we survey the recent progress on enzyme inhibitors of the cholesterol, sphingolipid, and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) synthesis pathways, as well as other metabolic pathways.",

            "text": "HCV was discovered to be the causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis by the Chiron Corporation in 1989 [1]. However, a treatment for patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis was established before the discovery of HCV. In 1986, Hoofnagle et al. reported that IFN-\u03b1 treatment normalized the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis [41]. Since the initial discovery of its anti-HCV activity, IFN-\u03b1 has become the major reagent for CH\u2013C treatment [4]. The replication of HCV RNA itself seems to stimulate IFN production signaling, and our recent results have suggested that core and/or NS5B induce IFN-stimulated genes [42], [43], [44]. However, viral NS3-4A protease inhibits the IFN production, although it does not completely shut it off. Therefore, exogenous IFN administration is needed for patients with CH\u2013C. The SVR is affected by multiple factors, such as genotype, viral load and duration of therapy. IFN-\u03b1 monotherapy was begun in the early 1990s, but an SVR was achieved in only about 10% of patients. In the early 2000s, IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin combination therapy was developed and the SVR was improved to about 30-40%. Furthermore, IFN itself has been modified by the attachment of PEG, thereby enhancing its stability in the blood. The SVR of the current standard therapy by PEG-IFN and ribavirin is as high as 50% [4]. In the current PEG-IFN and ribavirin combination therapy, the genotype of HCV is one of the major determinants of the SVR. HCV genotypes are classified into 6 groups, and genotype 1 is currently considered a problem due to its IFN resistance [45]. For example, in genotype 1 HCV, 12 months of treatment resulted in an SVR in 50% of patients, while in genotype 2, 6 months of treatment achieved an SVR of 80-90% [46]. The precise mechanisms of the IFN resistance remain unclear. However, the recently developed IFN-resistant HCV replicon-harboring cells will be useful for studies examining ways to improve the SVR [47], [48], [49]. Therefore, the focus in the treatment of patients with CH\u2013C has shifted to increasing the SVR in genotype 1 HCV.",

To facilitate the monitoring of the replication level of HCV RNA, the reporter gene (Renilla luciferase) was fused to the Neo gene. In this system, anti-HCV activity was evaluated by the value of the reporter instead of the quantification of HCV RNA or HCV proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, ORN/C-5B/KE contains the fused Renilla luciferase and Neo genes in the first cistron [51]. One of the cloned cell lines, OR6, was established by the G418 selection after introduction of ORN/C-5B/KE RNA into HuH-7 cells. HCV RNA and HCV proteins were stably expressed in the OR6 cells, and the Renilla luciferase activity was correlated well with the level of HCV RNA [51]. Therefore, the antiviral effect of the reagents on HCV RNA replication could be monitored by the activity of Renilla luciferase. The OR6 assay system facilitates the mass screening for anti-HCV reagents. HCV RNA replicating in OR6 cells contained an adaptive mutation, K1609E, in the NS3 region. Adaptive mutations have been reported to enhance the replication level of HCV RNA in cell culture [59], [60], [61]. In the case of HCV-O, two adaptive mutations were required for robust replication of the genome-length HCV RNA replication [60]. For example, authentic HCV-O RNA with the adaptive mutations of E1202G and K1609E can robustly replicate in HuH-7 cells for 9 months or more (Ikeda et al., unpublished data).",

These reports showed that the life cycle of HCV could be reconstructed in HuH-7 cells, and thus became landmarks in the search for an ideal HCV cell culture system. The unique features of these systems were the origin of this strain and the cell lines. JFH1 was a genotype 2a strain derived from a patient with fulminant hepatitis and did not require any adaptive mutations for robust replication, unlike other HCV strains. The unique feature of this system was that it employed HuH-7 cells such as Huh-7.5 or Huh-lunet cells, since the parental HuH-7 cells could not support robust production of infectious HCV [6], [7], [8], [62]. Recently, the genotype 1a H77-S strain was reported to produce infectious HCV in cell culture, although the production level of infectious H77-S was lower compared with that by JFH1 [63]. Interestingly, five adaptive mutations were introduced into the H77-S genome in order to enhance the efficiency of infectious virus production. The presence of these adaptive mutations is the most striking and controversial characteristic regarding the production of infectious HCV described above. Further study will be needed to understand the role of adaptive mutations on infectious virus production.",

The life cycle of HCV includes the (1) receptor binding and cell entry, (2) cytoplasmic release and uncoating, (3) IRES-mediated translation, (4) processing, (5) RNA replication, (6) packaging and assembly, (7) virion maturation, and (8) virion release. Although some of the mechanisms are still unclear, each of these steps is a target for antivirals. Among the proteins involved in these steps, the protease in step (4) and polymerase in step (5) have been especially well characterized.

As HCV is a parasite, it utilizes the cellular proteins for its replication machinery. Therefore, cellular proteins essential for HCV RNA replication are the targets for antivirals. Using cell culture systems, several cellular proteins have been identified as effective molecules for HCV RNA replication (Table 1). La and PTB were representative molecules reported as essential host factors for HCV RNA replication [40]. Recently, an immunosuppressant, CsA, has been reported to inhibit HCV RNA replication by blocking the binding of CyPB to NS5B [28]. HSP90 and the FK-506-binding protein 8 (FKBP8) form a complex with NS5A and geldanamycin, an inhibitor of HSP90, suppressed HCV RNA replication by blocking the formation of these complex [38]. The advantage of the inhibitors targeting cellular factor is that these reagents do not affect the viral escape achieved through mutations. The high mutation rate caused by RdRp frequently produced escape mutants toward the antiviral reagents for HCV proteins. A disadvantage of the inhibitors targeting cellular factors may be that they induce side effects by inhibiting the primary roles of the cellular factors.",

Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) are mevalonate-derived isoprenoids and are attached to the target proteins by farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyl transferase type I (GGTase-I), respectively. FTase and GGTase-I recognize protein substrates with a C-terminal tetrapeptide recognition motif called the CaaX box: in the case of GGTase-I, C is cysteine, a is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is leucine, isoleucine, valine, or phenylalanine. Production of mevalonate by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG\u2013CoA) reductase is the rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins are potent HMG\u2013CoA reductase inhibitors and are beneficial in the prevention of coronary heart disease. Statins also inhibit the prenylation of the proteins.",

For example, inhibition of small GTP-binding proteins, Ras and Rho, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on prenylation, may play a significant role in the pleiotropic effect of statins. Ras and Rho are major substrates for prenylation with FPP and GGPP, respectively. GDP-bound Ras and Rho are localized in the cytoplasm. When FPP or GGPP is bound to the inactive Ras or Rho, they are translocated to the cell membrane and converted to GTP-bound active forms. Recently, Wang et al. [68] identified FBL2 as one of the geranylgeranylated cellular proteins required for HCV RNA replication. FBL2 belongs to the FBL family of proteins, all of which contains an F box and a multiple leucine-rich repeat, with the F box binding to a multicomponent ubiquitin ligase complex. Geranylgeranylated FBL2 binds to NS5A, and the resulting complex seems to be required for HCV RNA replication. In HCV replicon-harboring cells, knockdown of FBL2 by siRNA has been shown to reduce HCV RNA by 65% [68]. Depletion of the GGPP by statins may inhibit the geranylgeranylation of cellular proteins such as FBL2 and cause the anti-HCV effect in the cells.",

One of the statins used clinically, LOV, has been well characterized and shown anti-HCV activity in cell culture. [66], [69], [70]. However, the anti-HCV activities of other statins remain to be clarified. Recently the anti-HCV activities of several statins were characterized using an OR6 assay system [71]. The anti-HCV activities were tested for five statins: atorvastatin (ATV), fluvastatin (FLV), pravastatin (PRV), simvastatin (SMV), and LOV. FLV exhibited the strongest anti-HCV activity (50% effective concentration to inhibit HCV RNA replication (EC50): 0. 9 \u03bcM), while ATV and SMV showed moderate inhibitory effects (EC50: 1.39 and 1.57 \u03bcM, respectively). However, LOV, which has been reported to inhibit HCV replication, was shown to possess the weakest anti-HCV activity (EC50: 2.16 \u03bcM). More recently, we found that PTV possessed stronger anti-HCV activity than FLV (Fig. 2B). The EC50 of PTV was calculated as 0.45 \u03bcM. The anti-HCV activities of statins were reversed by supplying mevalonate or geranylgeraniol. However, surprisingly, PRV exhibited no anti-HCV activity, although it worked as an inhibitor for HMG\u2013CoA reductase. Although PRV is a water-soluble reagent (the others are lipophilic), PRV induced the expression of HMG\u2013CoA reductase by a positive feedback mechanism. There may be another mechanism underlying the depletion of GGPP by the statins. Interestingly, it has been reported that only PRV has a different effect on the induction of P450 compared with the other statins [72].",

Since FLV exhibited strong anti-HCV activity, FLV was examined for its anti-HCV activity in combination with IFN-\u03b1 in OR6 cells [71]. Co-treatment of IFN-\u03b1 and FLV exhibited synergistic inhibitory effects on HCV RNA replication.

Furthermore, specific inhibition of the proteins modified by GGTase-I may be more effective. FBL2 may be one of the target proteins, because its formation of a complex with NS5A is required for HCV RNA replication. Therefore, the reagents blocking the association of FBL2 with NS5A will be able to inhibit the HCV RNA replication with fewer side effects. Prenyltransferase recognizes a broad range of protein substrates with a CaaX motif. Reid et al. [77] reported a list of hypothetical prenyltransferase substrates within the human genome.

RhoA is activated by geranylgeranylation, and activated RhoA interacts with the F glycoprotein of RSV. FLV inhibited cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication by abolishing CMV-induced NF-\u03baB activity, which is involved in a pathway that is crucial for CMV replication [79]. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), LOV and SIV reduced HIV replication via suppression of the binding between the integrin intercellular adhesion molecule 1(ICAM1) and lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) [80]. Statins were recently shown to bind to LFA-1, and ICAM1-bearing viruses were reduced by statins in a dose-dependent manner. It is noteworthy that the inhibition of LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 by statins is independent of the inhibition of HMG CoA reductase. Statins inhibited the cholesterol-biosynthesis pathway and branched prenylation pathways by depletion of mevalonate. The latter caused pleiotropic effects in growth, differentiation, and antivirals. However, an unknown function of statins may exist\u2014for example, the binding of LFA-1 is likely independent of the cholesterol-lowering and the inhibition of prenylation. Furthermore, the finding that PRV has a different effect on the induction of P450 than the other statins has not been clearly explained by the characterization of these mechanisms of statins. A better understanding of this finding may lead to the discovery of statin-related anti-HCV reagents that do not have exhibit any cholesterol-lowering activity or inhibition of prenylation.",

In mammalian cells, ceramide is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and translocates to the Golgi compartment for conversion to sphingomyelin. HPA-12, an inhibitor of ceramide trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, also inhibited the replication of HCV replicon. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are also a component of lipid rafts, and PPMP, an inhibitor of GSL biosynthesis, also suppressed the replication of HCV replicon. Furthermore, they demonstrated that after treatment with NA255, the NS5B ratio in the DRM was markedly decreased. Interestingly, however, the DRM fraction of NS3 and NS5A were not affected. Inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis by NA255 disrupted the association of lipid rafts with NS5B, but not with NS3 or NS5A.

Four possible mechanisms have been proposed [73], [84]: (1) direct inhibition of RNA replication; (2) inhibition of IMPDH; (3) immunomodulation; (4) mutagenesis. Ribavirin is phosphorylated to mono-, di-, and triphosphate (RMP, RDP, and RTP, respectively). (1) RTP, an analog of GTP, is incorporated into replicating RNA by RdRp and caused termination of the RNA synthesis. (2) RMP competitively inhibits the host enzyme IMPDH, which is essential for the synthesis of GTP, and causes a depletion of the GTP pool. (3) Rivavirin has been suggested to cause immunomodulatory effects, such as the shift of Th2 to Th1 in immune response, and to induce an HCV-specific T cell response. (4) Ribavirin acts as an RNA mutagen and causes error catastrophe. In poliovirus replication, 100 \u03bcM of ribavirin increased the mutation rate from about 1.5 mutations/genome (wild type) to about 1.9 mutations/genome and resulted in a decrease of infectivity of 70% [85]. The mutation rate increased in a ribavirin dose-dependent manner: 6.9 mutations/genome and 15.5 mutations/genome at 400 \u03bcM and 1000 \u03bcM, respectively [85].",

Therefore, the N-glycosylation pathway may be a novel molecular target for antivirals. Chapel et al.

Unmethylated STAT1 is less active because it can be bound and inactivated by its inhibitor, the protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1). Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is the enzyme responsible for the methylation of STAT1. HCV proteins induced the expression of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac), and overexpression of PP2Ac induced STAT1 hypomethylation via the inhibition of PRMT1. Finally, PIAS1 interacted with and inhibited hypomethylated STAT1 and resulted in the suppression of IFN signaling [102].",

Currently IFN has been modified by PEG and accompanied by the powerful partner, ribavirin, which boosts the anti-HCV activity of IFN. During the development of IFN therapy for patients with CH\u2013C, the lack of a robust method of HCV RNA replication in cell culture has hampered research into the HCV life cycle and the discovery of potent new anti-HCV reagents. It is difficult to attack the Achilles' heel of HCV without information on the replication machinery of the virus. However, the development of a subgenomic replicon system by Lohmann et al. [5] partially revealed the HCV life cycle. The information about HCV RNA replication in the virus life cycle provided clues to the development of antivirals both from the standpoint of the virus and the host. A representative example is the discovery that NS3-4A inhibits innate immunity [105]. HCV runs through the cellular first defenses of the IFN-production system. NS3-4A, a serine protease, cleaved the unexpected cellular target Cardif and disrupted RIG-I signaling [106]. HCV replicon contributed to the discovery of the viral serine protease inhibitor. Surprisingly, a serine protease inhibitor, SCH6, inhibited HCV RNA replication not only by the inhibition of NS3-4A activity but also by the inhibition of the RIG-I signaling [105]. This serine protease inhibitor possesses dual functions, inhibiting both viral (NS3-4A) and cellular (Cardif) proteins involved in IFN production.",

The high mutation rate enhances the viral evolution. As for the reagents targeting viral proteins, such as NS3-4A or NS5B, resistance to the therapy happens by the frequent mutations caused by RdRp. In fact, in the clinical trial of the NS3-4A protease inhibitor, VX-950, HCV RNA rapidly decreased within 3 days after treatment [20]. However, HCV RNA increased again at around 14 days after treatment [20]. HCV mutants may not be the problem in the anti-HCV reagent against cellular proteins, although the inhibition of the primary functions of the cellular proteins may cause side effects. In this review, host metabolic pathways are overviewed. One of the advantages of targeting host metabolism as antivirals is that multiple enzymes involved in the metabolism could become candidates for antivirals. In the strategy targeting host metabolism, we should be careful in regard to the side effects caused by inhibition of the primary function of the metabolite. To minimize these undesirable effects, pinpoint inhibition of the enzyme should be done.",

This system provides information regarding the complete life cycle of HCV and will extend our understanding of the antivirals to virus entry, assembly and release. The discovery of anti-HCV reagents targeting host metabolism in the HCV life cycle will improve the SVR in combination with IFN. Or, the development of new anti-HCV reagents could lead to the retirement of IFN in the near future.",

The adaptive mutation from lysine (K) to glutamine (E) at amino acids position 1609 was previously reported [51] and introduced into the genome-length HCV RNA. (B) Inhibition of HCV RNA by PTV. OR6 cells were cloned cell line selected by G418 [51]. OR6 cells were treated with PTV at a concentration of 0, 0.156, 0.31, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, or 5 \u03bcM. After 72 hours of treatment the RL activities were determined. Shown here is the relative RL activity (%) calculated when the RL activity of untreated cells was assigned as 100%.
