            "text": "All orthopaedic surgery programs participating in the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) were identified. One hundred seventy-five (175) participant orthopaedic programs were directly contacted via telephone on March 23, 2020, through March 26, 2020, to ascertain their current utilization of telehealth services (Tables 1 and 2). The seven-item questionnaire addressed whether each program is currently using telehealth services and if such offerings have only recently been implemented as a direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For those programs not offering telehealth services at present, we further inquired as to whether they were in the process of actively setting it up. We further attempted to ascertain which level of provider would perform the telehealth visits, which were categorized as physician (MD), advanced practice provider (APP), or trainee (fellow or resident physician). Each program was additionally asked if preappointment imaging would be available and if a co-payment and referral are requirements for a telehealth visit. Finally, we inquired as to which electronic medical/health record (EMR/EHR) is being used at each institution. In addition, geographic region was determined for the comparison of regional differences between the Northeast, South, Midwest, and West regions (Tables 1 and 3). These geographic data were further used to create a heat map of orthopaedic departments providing telehealth services (Figure 2) with direct comparison with a heat map produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) depicting the COVID-19 disease burden in the United States (Figure 1). In addition, select \u201chot spots\u201d of disease burden from differing regions of the United States were identified by the number of COVID-19 positive patients, per CDC reporting, and evaluated regarding the number of institutions providing telehealth services before the pandemic and those providing new telehealth services in direct response to the pandemic (Table 4).",

The authors reported no difference in patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person clinic visits; however, no one in the telemedicine group took time off from work and spent markedly less time on their visits compared with the clinic follow-up group with most patients (75%) agreeing to future follow-up visits with telemedicine. In addition, Sharareh and Schwarzkopf17 found that patients receiving telemedicine visits after total joint arthroplasty reported higher satisfaction with less calls to the clinic staff. Similarly, in a systematic review by Gilbert et al,18 patients readily accepted the idea of using real time video conferencing for their visits with orthopaedic surgery providers.",
