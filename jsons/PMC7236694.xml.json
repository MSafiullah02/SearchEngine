            "text": "Many juvenile justice systems have started using standardized risk and/or needs assessment tools in an attempt to predict recidivism. Risk and need assessments in criminal and juvenile justice refer to actuarial assessments that identify various factors that promote or inhibit involvement in crime (Slobogin, 2013). Dynamic risk and protective factors may change due to maturation and learned skills while static factors do not (Slobogin, 2013). Typical static factors include age of first arrest, number of arrests, number of detentions, and other characteristics of justice involvement. Dynamic factors include community/family support, substance use behaviors, values, attitudes, and educational achievements. Risk and need assessments identify services and interventions that can minimize the static risk factors and bolster the dynamic protective factors (Jones, Brown, Robinson, & Frey, 2016).",

            "text": "Historically, four generations of design have shaped criminal risk and assessment tools. The first generation of risk assessments relied on the subjective judgments of professionals who would gauge the safety risks a person poses to others (Bonta, Harman, Hann, & Cormier, 1996). Second generation risk assessments relied heavily on criminal history to determine risk of recidivism (Baird et al., 2013). These assessments used around a dozen different mostly static empirical attributes (Andrews, Bonta, & Wormith, 2006) to predict recidivism and classify by severity of risk (Schwalbe, 2008). These assessments aimed to identify restriction and supervision levels for each category of risk (Schwalbe, 2008). Third generation risk assessments survey both static and dynamic risk factors and use them to predict recidivism (Andrews et al., 2006). Fourth generation risk assessments include additional protective factors and reference responsivity, differentiate static and dynamic factors, and give recommendations for case management (Baird et al., 2013). The fourth generation assessment tool the Youth Assessment Screening Instrument (YASI) originated in Washington State (Baglivio, 2009). The Washington State Institute of Public Policy and the Washington State Association of Juvenile Court Administrators designed YASI with the goal of both enhancing the effectiveness of treatment systems by targeting youth to services based on their area of need and to protect the public from future crimes through appropriate clinical supervision (Jones et al., 2016).",

Many risk assessment tools provide overall scores and categories (e.g., high, medium, low), but do not differentiate between domains. However, some domains predict recidivism more strongly than others. For example, one study found stronger associations between environmental and personal characteristics and outcomes than legal history (Baglivio, 2009). Another found that substance dependence and criminal cognitions predict outcomes better than family support, peer associations, or other factors (Taxman & Caudy, 2015). Also, individual level risk factors may cluster, such as in environmental situations in more disordered neighborhoods. Thus exclusionary discipline incidents may seem like individual factors but be far more common in under-resourced schools (Rodriguez, 2013). Few studies have systematically examined multi-needs to determine which single factor or patters of clusters predict different outcomes, and thus agencies often lack the capacity to offer services to facilitate more positive youth development expecially among youth with complex needs.",

In light of such clustering researchers can use the statistical procedure latent class analysis (LCA) to identify patterns of risk profiles based on a person-centered approach using a \u201cholistic-interactionistic framework\u201d (Bergman & Magnusson, 1997, p. 293). Such an approach views \u201cindividual development as a process characterized by states that change in continuous time,\u201d which \u201cis partly specific to individuals\u201d (Bergman & Magnusson, 1997, p. 293). Although a vast number of possibilities may exist, common patterns will likely emerge (Bergman & Magnusson, 1997), distinguishing subgroups. LCA is well-suited to test, for example, an interactional theory of delinquency. Such an approach is consistent with the concept of equifinality \u2013 delinquency has multiple possible causes and combinations of causes rather than a single cause (Thornberry & Krohn, 2005). Identifying the state of pattern of youth risk and need factors as they enter probation can provide insight into possible categories of youth needs that could drive service \u201cpackages\u201d to address the unmet youth needs. That is, the system can use this information to ensure that youth have opportunities to participate in programs that are likely to yield more positive outcomes.",

Cluster analysis is a descriptive approach to identifying patterns (Bergman & Magnusson, 1997). Schwalbe et al. (2008) used LCA to analyze a sample of 542 court-involved youth from North Carolina. They also identified five risk profiles: a low-need group, serious school problems, hostility-inattention, high risk and family history, and substance abuse and peer delinquency. Schwalbe et al. used a relatively small sample size that could not support models with more than five classes. The lack of convergence in their models with more than five classes suggests their sample may have had insufficient power to detect additional classes due to low prevalence of some of the need factors (Nylund-Gibson & Choi, 2018).",

Youth are classified as having none/low, moderate, or high levels of risk or protective factors on each of the subscales. Table 2 presents the 25 subscales and the prevalence of youth in each category.",

LCA identifies groupings of individuals based on a set of indicators. Cluster analysis is a descriptive approach to identifying patterns while LCA is model-based approach that generates fit statistics that allow for comparisons between models (Bergman & Magnusson, 1997). Thus, researchers estimate models iteratively, with each subsequent model specifying one additional class. No clear agreement as to which statistics researchers should use to identify the preferred model has emerged in the literature (Nylund-Gibson & Choi, 2018). In this study we used LCA\u2019s information criteria to identify the most desirable fit: the Bayesian Information Criterion, sample-size adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion, Akaike Information Criterion, where the lowest value indicates the preferred model. However, these information criteria often continue to decrease without reaching a minimum (Nylund-Gibson & Choi, 2018). In these cases, researchers can plot the values to identify the point of diminishing return (Nylund-Gibson & Choi, 2018). Another type of statistic researchers use to identify the preferred model are the likelihood-based tests, and we used the Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin test, which compares nested models and uses a significance test to determine whether the additional class provides improved model fit (Nylund-Gibson & Choi, 2018). We used a random sample of half the cases (n=8,201) to assess whether the results are robust and produce comparable results, and they were.",

These include the fact that all participants came from a single U.S. state, and similar analyses with data from other locations may reveal different groups. For example, in comparison to previous studies, these findings revealed three new groups including two gender-specific groups. Specific artifacts in the data, as well as the indicators researchers use to create the groups, may affect LCA analyses. Moreover, LCA is a descriptive technique, and thus, multiple studies should be considered in tandem with this one. Thus, future research should undertake the same and similar analyses as those we conducted. Still, these findings provide useful insight and have implications for practitioners.",

It showed that youth on probation differ from one another in significant ways, and tailoring of services to their needs will make them more effective. Juvenile justice system intervention should move away from singular interventions focused on a single need and toward multidimensional interventions that recognize the unique needs of individuals. Expanding services offered to youth in this manner may foster positive development among youth preparing to transition to adulthood. Maschi et al. (2008) refer to the juvenile justice system as a \u201csystem of last resort,\u201d which, to some, may justify emphasizing punishment and narrowly defined opportunities for reform. However, given the size of the juvenile justice system and the overuse of the system for minority youth, it must support positive growth and provide opportunities that will benefit young people. The current research bolsters the claim that using the concepts of systemic responsivity can facilitate changes in the juvenile justice system.",
