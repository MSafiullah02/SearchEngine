This approach was first implemented for the generation and genetic manipulation of positive strand RNA viruses, whose deproteinized genomes are able to act as mRNA and initiate the virus life cycle once delivered into appropriate susceptible cells. In contrast, the template of the polymerases of negative strand (NS) RNA viruses is exclusively a nucleocapsid consisting of the genomic RNA tightly encapsidated by the virus nucleoprotein (N), which associated with the virus polymerase proteins forms a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. This RNP is active in transcription and replication and is the minimum unit of infectivity. Consequently, deproteinized genomes of NS RNA viruses cannot function as mRNAs and are not infectious. Thus, generation of biologically active synthetic NS viruses from cDNA will require trans complementation by all of the viral proteins involved in virus replication and transcription.",

However, during the last 15 years, following the pioneering work of Palese's group (Luytjes et al., 1989), significant progress has been made in this area and reverse genetics systems have been now developed for all ribovirus families. These developments have revolutionized the analysis of cis-acting sequences and trans-acting proteins required for virus replication, transcription, assembly and cell egress. In addition, these developments have paved the way for engineering these viruses for vaccine and gene therapy purposes. Moreover, using reverse genetics approaches it has been possible to develop cell-based minireplicon or minigenome (MG) assays to conduct studies under BSL2 conditions to dissect many aspects of the molecular and cell biology associated with the life cycle of BSL4 viruses. MG-based assays have also provided the foundations for the development of novel screening strategies to identify and validate compounds that could potentially be developed into effective antiviral drugs.",

In recent years, increased air travel between Africa and other areas has led to the importation of cases into the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada (Holmes et al., 1990, Freedman and Woodall, 1999, Isaacson, 2001). JUNV, which is endemic to the humid pampas of Argentine, causes Argentine HF (AHF) that if left untreated has a high (15\u201330%) case-fatality rate (Enria et al., 2008). Moreover, it is worth noting that compelling evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed prototypic arenavirus LCMV is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance, especially in cases of congenital infection leading to hydrocephalus, mental retardation and chorioretinitis in infants (Jahrling and Peters, 1992, Barton and Mets, 1999, Barton and Mets, 2001, Mets et al., 2000, Barton et al., 2002). In addition, LCMV poses a special threat to immunocompromised individuals, as tragically illustrated by recent cases of transplant-associated infections by LCMV with a fatal outcome in the USA (Fischer et al., 2006, Peters, 2006).",

Sequence comparison between the Candid 1 and virulent strains of JUNV have shown multiple mutations within NP, GP and L are associated with the vaccine strain, but their relative contributions to attenuation have not been determined.",

Therefore, the development of an effective and safe vaccine would represent a major accomplishment, not only in West Africa but also in other geographic regions due to the risk of imported cases of LF posed by increased international travel. Contrary to the situation found with JUNV and AHF, the neutralizing antibody response is not predictive of survival of LF (McCormick and Fisher-Hoch, 2002). Therefore, it is likely that the mechanisms responsible for the success of the JUNV Candid 1 strain vaccine for AHF may not serve the same purpose in the case of LF.",

However, the high prevalence of HIV in West Africa and the safety profile of vaccinia virus raise serious doubts about the potential implementation of this approach. Alphavirus-based vectors have been used to induce protective immunity in guinea pigs (Pushko et al., 2001), and more recently a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the LASV GP replaced the VSV G, was shown to provide protection against lethal challenge (Geisbert et al., 2005).

The power of reverse genetics as a tool for arenavirus vaccine development is illustrated by recent findings obtained with a recombinant LCMV expressing the surface GP of VSV serotype Indiana instead of its own GP (rLCMV/INDG) (Pinschewer et al., 2003b). In mice, rLCMV/INDG exhibited a highly attenuated phenotype that remained stable upon long-term propagation in immunocompromised mice (Bergthaler et al., 2006), but it was able to elicit very strong, long-term T cell-mediated immunity against lethal challenge with wild-type LCMV (Bergthaler et al., 2006).",

Moreover, Rib has been shown to reduce significantly both morbidity and mortality in humans associated with LASV (McCormick et al., 1986, Andrei and De Clercq, 1993, Damonte and Coto, 2002), and experimentally in Machupo (Kilgore et al., 1997) and JUNV infections (McKee et al., 1988), if given early in the course of clinical disease. The mechanisms by which Rib exerts its anti-arenaviral action remain poorly understood, but likely involve targeting different steps of the virus life cycle (Parker, 2005, Leyssen et al., 2008). Recent evidence indicates that Rib can be used as substrate by the RdRp of some riboviruses leading to C to U and G to A transitions (Crotty et al., 2000, Cameron and Castro, 2001, Parker, 2005). This mutagenic activity of Rib has been linked to its antiviral activity via lethal mutagenesis (Cameron and Castro, 2001). However, Rib inhibited very strongly LCMV replication without exerting any noticeable mutagenic effect on the virus genome RNA (Ruiz-Jarabo et al., 2003). In humans, treatment causes a reversible anemia, and the drug has also caused birth defects in laboratory animals, so that it may not be prescribed to pregnant women. In addition, oral Rib is significantly less effective than the one administered intravenously, which poses logistic complications in regions with limited clinical infrastructure.",

Likewise, cell-based HTS based on the use of pseudotyped virion particles bearing the GP of highly pathogenic arenaviruses identified several small-molecule inhibitors of virus cell entry mediated by LASV GP (Lee et al., 2008). These findings illustrate how complex chemical libraries used in the context of appropriate screening assays can be harnessed into a powerful tool to identify candidate antiviral drugs with highly specific activities. To this goal, recent progress in the molecular and cell biology of arenaviruses, including the development of reverse genetics systems, have opened new avenues for the identification of steps in the arenavirus life cycle that are amenable to drug targeting and the development of appropriate screening strategies to identify such drugs.",

Likewise, the reassortment approach cannot be used to generate viruses with predetermined mutations in their genomes. This inability to genetically manipulate the arenavirus genome has hampered studies aimed at understanding its molecular and cell biology, as well as the role played by each viral gene product in virus\u2013host interactions during both acute and persistent infections and associated diseases. Reverse genetics systems that support RNA replication and expression of arenavirus minigenomes have been developed for LCMV, as well as for LASV (Hass et al., 2004) and the NW arenavirus Tacaribe (TCV) (Lopez et al., 2001), and have provided investigators with a novel and powerful approach for the investigation of the trans-acting factors and cis-acting sequences that control arenavirus replication and gene expression, as well as assembly and budding (Fig. 3\n). The LCMV MG system is based on intracellular synthesis, via either plasmid-supplied T7 RNA polymerase or RNA polymerase I (pol-I), of RNA analogues (MG) that contains the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR and IGR cis-acting sequences required for the control of RNA synthesis mediated by the LCMV polymerase, and the ORF of a reporter gene in lieu of the NP ORF. Encapsidation of the pol-I or T7-derived LCMV MG RNA by plasmid-supplied NP generates a template that is recognized by the intracellularly reconstituted LCMV polymerase to direct synthesis of full-length anti-minigenome (aMG) RNA (replicate) and a subgenomic mRNA (transcript) that codes for the reporter gene of choice (Lee et al., 2000). Incorporation into the transfection mix of GPC and Z-expressing plasmids allows for assembly and budding of infectious VLPs (Lee et al., 2002, Perez et al., 2003).",

Similar findings have been now documented for LASV (Hass et al., 2004) and TCV (Lopez et al., 2001). Notably, both genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that oligomerization of L is required for polymerase function (Sanchez and de la Torre, 2005). The activity of the LCMV genomic promoter recognized by the virus polymerase requires both sequence specificity within the highly conserved 3\u2032-terminal 19 nt of arenavirus genomes, and the integrity of the predicted panhandle structure formed via sequence complementarity between the 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-termini of viral genome RNAs (Perez and de la Torre, 2002). Detailed structure-function studies using the LASV MG system (Hass et al., 2006) revealed that the LASV promoter, and likely that of all arenaviruses, regulates transcription and replication in a coordinated manner. It is composed of two functional elements: a sequence-specific region from residue 1\u201312 and a variable complementary region from residue 13\u201319. The first region appears to interact with the replication complex mainly via base-specific interactions, while in the second region, base pairing between 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-termini of the promoter determines its activity.",

This inhibitory effect of Z has been also reported for TAV (Lopez et al., 2001) and LASV (Hass et al., 2004). Z has been postulated to participate in virion morphogenesis (Salvato et al., 1992, Salvato, 1993). For most enveloped viruses, a matrix (M) protein is involved in organizing the virion components prior to assembly, but arenaviruses do not have an obvious counterpart of M. However, we (Perez et al., 2003) and others (Strecker et al., 2003, Urata et al., 2006) have shown that Z is the main driving force of arenavirus budding and that this process is mediated by the Z proline-rich late domain motifs (LDM) PTAP and PPPY, similar to those known to control budding of several other viruses including HIV and Ebola, via interaction with specific host cell proteins (Freed, 2002). Consistent with this observation, Z exhibits features characteristic of bona fide budding proteins: the ability to bud from cells by itself and to efficiently substitute for other LDM (Perez et al., 2003). Targeting of Z to the plasma membrane, the location of arenavirus budding, strictly required its myristoylation (Perez et al., 2004). These data support a role of Z as the arenavirus counterpart of the M proteins found in many other NS RNA viruses, a notion that is consistent with recent ultrastructural data on arenavirus virions determined by cryo-electron microscopy (Neuman et al., 2005).",

During recent years there has been great progress in developing aminoglycoside-based analogues (mimetics) to circumvent these issues (Sears and Wong, 1999, Sears and Wong, 2001, Ye and Zhang, 2002). These advances have permitted the generation of complex combinatorial libraries of aminoglycosides that can be subjected to robust novel screening procedures (Hermann, 2000, Hermann and Westhof, 2000, Sucheck et al., 2000, Sucheck and Wong, 2000, Wilson and Li, 2000, Sears and Wong, 2001, Sucheck and Shue, 2001, Ye and Zhang, 2002). These developments are facilitating the identification of drugs that bind specifically to a variety of RNA folds, thus opening new ways to expand the existing repertoire of protein-targeted therapeutics. The potential of aminoglycosides as antiviral molecules by acting on RNA has been illustrated by their ability to disrupt selectively the HIV-1 Rev-RRE (Zapp et al., 1993) and Tat-TAR (Wang et al., 1998) interactions. Similar approaches could be used to select aminoglycosides that interact with the arenavirus promoter and disrupt its activity. The sequence conservation of the arenavirus promoter predicts that aminoglycoside-based small molecules selected based on their activity against the promoter of the prototypic arenavirus LCMV would be also active against LASV and other HF arenaviruses.",

            "text": "Early studies documented that the 3\u2032 ends of the non-polyadenylated LCMV mRNAs were heterogeneous and mapped within the IGR (Meyer et al., 2002). All arenavirus IGR sequences are predicted to fold into single or double stem-loop structures (Meyer et al., 2002, Buchmeier et al., 2007), suggesting a structure-dependent transcription termination mechanism reminiscent of rho-independent termination in prokaryotes (Yarnell and Roberts, 1999, Tortorici et al., 2001). This prediction has received direct experimental support from results obtained using arenavirus MG systems (Pinschewer et al., 2005, Lopez and Franze-Fernandez, 2007). Unexpectedly, LCMV MGs without IGR were dramatically impaired in their ability to passage reporter gene activity via infectious VLP (Pinschewer et al., 2005), suggesting that in addition to its role in the control of RNA synthesis, the IGR plays a role in virus assembly or budding, or both, required for the efficient propagation of LCMV infectivity. In this regard, it is worth noting that LCMV genome and antigenome RNA species present in arenavirus RNPs were found to be sensitive to cleavage by very low concentrations of Rnases, suggesting that the arenavirus genome and antigenome are not tightly encapsidated, and are thereby potentially vulnerable to targeting. There is significant sequence heterogeneity between the IGR of the L and S segments of the each arenavirus species and between the L and S segments of different species. However, as with the virus genome promoter, IGRs are predicted to have a conserved folding that could provide a suitable target.",

Targeting these highly \u201clocalized\u201d surfaces may be sufficient for inhibiting protein\u2013protein interactions. Notably, combinatorial libraries of small molecules generated via solution-phase methodology have been uniquely successful in the identification of small molecules that inhibit protein\u2013protein interactions for a series of significant biological targets (Boger et al., 1998, Boger et al., 2003, Boger, 2003). Similar approaches should be applicable to screens to identify small-molecule inhibitors of arenavirus polymerases.",

S1P cleaves within the motif R-X-(hydrophobic)-XI. Despite its broad consensus sequence, S1P exhibits exquisite substrate specificity and is involved in proteolytic processing of a defined set of cellular proteins including brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) precursor protein (Seidah et al., 1999) and the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1 and SREBP-2), which are membrane-associated transcription factors that regulate genes involved in lipid metabolism and cholesterol synthesis (Brown and Goldstein, 1997, Goldstein et al., 2002, Rawson, 2003a, Rawson, 2003b). S1P contributes also to the regulation of ATF6 and other transcription factors controlling the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the cell to bring the folding capacity of the ER in line with the folding demand (Ye et al., 2000, Schroder and Kaufman, 2005, Zhang and Kaufman, 2006, Zhang et al., 2006).",

Notably, studies on LCMV and JUNV infection in cells deficient in S1P have indicated that the emergence of variants capable of growing independent of S1P-mediated processing of GPC appears to be highly unlikely (Kunz and de la Torre, unpublished). These findings strongly support the view that inhibitors of S1P protease represent promising drug candidates. It is worth noting that S1P also mediates processing of the major GP precursor of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a member of the Nairovirus genus with the family Bunyaviridae (Sanchez et al., 2002, Vincent et al., 2003). Therefore, compounds exerting anti-arenaviral activity by inhibiting the processing of the virus GPC precursor would be likely to be effective also against CCHFV, a tick-borne pathogen that causes HF in humans throughout regions of Africa, Asia and Europe.",

These inhibitors also blocked the activity of the furin in vitro, but showed specificity towards S1P when used in cells at <100 \u03bcM. Because they cause irreversible inhibition of the catalytic activity of S1P against all targets, whether host cell or pathogen-derived, their use would pose difficulties for a therapeutic approach that aims at specific inhibition of S1P-mediated processing of viral GPs without affecting S1P's activity towards its cellular substrates.

Expression of the viral envelope GP in the ER is often a major trigger for the UPR, due to an overwhelming of the folding capacities of the ER resulting in the accumulation of unfolded viral GP. Some aspects of the UPR, such as an increase in the ER's folding capacity and metabolic adaptations, are likely favorable for viral infection, while others, such as the suppression of protein translation and increased ER protein degradation, appear to be disadvantageous. Non-cytolyic viruses, such as arenaviruses, that readily persist may have evolved mechanisms to differentially modulate the different branches of the UPR to favor viral replication and gene expression maintaining aspects of the UPR that are beneficial for the host cell. Arenaviruses may have evolved to use S1P instead of other proteases of the proprotein convertase family commonly used for processing of viral GPs, e.g. furin, because the interaction of GP with S1P allows the virus to manipulate the host cell's UPR. This feature could pose additional barriers to the emergence of viral variants capable of using an alternative protease for the processing of GPC, which would enhance the antiviral power of inhibitors of S1P.",

The identification and characterization of LFV Z-host protein interactions involved in virus budding may uncover novel antiviral targets and facilitate the development of screening strategies to identify drugs capable of disrupting budding and preventing virus propagation. In this regard, we have already identified TSG101 and CHMP3, members respectively of the ESCRT-I and ESCRT-III complexes, as Z-interacting cellular proteins required for budding. Notably, down-regulation of TSG101 via siRNA (Perez et al., 2003) or the use of dominant-negative forms of CHMP3 (Perez and de la Torre, unpublished) resulted in dramatically reduced levels of Z-mediated budding.",

This assay, however, had some significant limitations: it measured the incorporation of firefly luciferase (FFL) into VP40 VLPs, and thereby did not directly measure the budding capability of VP40, and it required ultracentrifugation of the VLPs for detection of budding. These results, however, raised the possibility of using chimeric proteins consisting of the bona fide viral budding protein fused to an appropriate reporter gene such as FFL as tools to develop assays in which budding could be rapidly and quantitatively assessed by measuring levels of gene reporter activity. In this regard, recent findings have shown that the fusion of the smaller (185 amino acids) luciferase from Gaussia princeps (GLuc) (Tannous et al., 2005) to Z resulted in a chimeric protein (Z-GLuc) that retain wild-type Z budding activity that could be monitored by direct measuring of GLuc activity in TCS of Z-GLuc transfected cells (A.A. Capul and J.C. de la Torre, manuscript submitted). Initial studies have shown that this Z-GLuc based budding assay consistently exhibits a high (average 10-fold) signal-to-noise ratio, as described (Ghosh et al., 2005), suggesting that it should be amenable for the development of HTS to identify small-molecule inhibitors of Z-mediated budding.",

In contrast, the rescue of rLCMV expressing additional heterologous gene products posed unexpected difficulties. Several strategies successfully employed with other NS RNA viruses to express additional gene products did not work in the case of LCMV (S. Emonet and J.C. de la Torre, unpublished). These included: (1) incorporation into the virus genome of an additional transcription unit containing the ORF of interest; (2) use of a viral or cellular internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to direct cap-independent synthesis of a protein coded by an ORF located downstream within a polycistronic mRNA; and (3) use of the self-cleaving 2A protease of picornaviruses for efficient processing of an initially synthesized polypeptide to generate independently the proteins coded by the ORFs located up- and downstream of the 2 A. Recent findings, however, have supported the feasibility of rescuing a rLCMV containing three genome segments: 1 L and 2 S (S. Emonet and J.C. de la Torre, unpublished). This has opened the possibility of rescuing a three-segment rLCMV, in which each of the two S segments contains a gene of interest (GOI) instead of one of either GPC or NP. The rationale behind this approach is that the physical separation of GP and NP into two different S segments would represent a strong selective pressure to select and maintain a virus capable of packaging 1 L and 2 S segments (Fig. 5\n). This strategy has been used to generate a variety of tri-segmented (2 S + 1 L) rLCMV, where in each of the S segments one of the two virus genes (GPC or NP) was replaced by a gene of interest, including reporter genes such as CAT or luciferase. Notably, the genotype, growth properties and reporter gene expression of these rLCMV were stably maintained during serial passage. This new development provides investigators with a fantastic tool for the development of HTS assays to globally identify inhibitors of arenavirus multiplication.",

MG cell-based assays offer a number of benefits in the discovery and analysis of antiviral compounds. They permit the effect of an antiviral compound to be observed in the context of living cells, so that any compounds that show antiviral activity necessarily are able to enter and act within living cells. They also allow the immediate identification of compounds with undesirable cytotoxicity, using well-established assays. Because viral functions related to infectivity are not required for MG RNA replication and expression, these systems are safer and easier to work with than infectious pathogenic arenaviruses. It is worth noting that the implementation of siRNA-based screens in the context of cell-based MG rescue assays can identify host cell proteins that play key roles in arenavirus RNA replication and gene expression and thereby open potential novel targets that could be used in the development of effective anti-arenaviral drugs. The ability to generate rLCMV with predetermined genetic modifications would also facilitate studies aimed at identifying mechanisms of antiviral drug action and the possible generation and selection of drug-resistant viral variants.",
