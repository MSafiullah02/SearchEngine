            "text": "Humanity could not survive without a reliably clean, safe, and steady flow of drinking water. Since the early 1900s when typhoid fever and cholera were frequently causes of waterborne illness in developed countries, drinking water supplies have been protected and treated to ensure water safety, quality, and quantity. Having access to safe drinking water has always been one of the cornerstones of good public health. Safe water is not limited to drinking water, since recreational water and aerosolized water can also be sources for waterborne illness, from treated waters such as in swimming pools, whirlpools, or splash pads and from non-treated surface waters such as lakes, rivers, streams and ponds. Recreational waters may cause illness not only from ingestion of pathogens, but also when in contact with eyes, ears, or skin. Some pathogens in water can be acquired by inhalation of aerosols from water that is agitated or sprayed such as in humidifiers, fountains, or misting of produce. This poses a potential risk to those exposed, particularly if they are immunocompromised.",

To be most effective, have this number monitored 24/7 by staff or an answering service. If possible, the utilization of social media such as Facebook or Twitter should be considered and monitored as many large municipalities (including drinking water utilities) and recreational facilities have an Internet presence. If your agency has social media accounts, consider using this vehicle to further disseminate information regarding waterborne illness clusters or outbreaks. Identify medical care facilities and practitioners and seek their participation. Direct educational activities, such as newsletters and talks at meetings, to stimulate participation in the program. Encourage water treatment utilities and operators of recreational water sites to report suspected complaints of waterborne illness to the appropriate local agencies. Also, encourage private and hospital laboratories to report isolations of parasitic agents (e.g., Giardia, Cryptosporidium), viruses (e.g., norovirus and hepatitis A virus), bacteria (e.g., E. coli (pathogenic), Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae), and other agents that may be waterborne.

It is easy for agencies to miscommunicate before and during a water crisis (See Box 1, False Alarm; Box 2, The Walkerton Outbreak; Box 3, The Flint Water Crisis). It is often preferable to have one spokesperson for all agencies. Do not release preliminary information that has not been confirmed. The person giving information about an outbreak should be well informed about the etiologic agent being investigated and prepared to deal with questions. If the health hazard warrants a public warning at the hypothesis stage, tell the public why emergency measures are being invoked and that subsequent information may be cause to modify the action. As the investigation proceeds and the etiologic agent is confirmed and contributory factors are identified, consider terminating emergency measures, and give advice on specific control and preventive measures. Attempt to reach all segments of the population at risk; this may require communication in multiple languages. Route all news releases or statements to all persons involved in the investigation. In situations involving large outbreaks or highly virulent or toxigenic etiologic agents, set up an emergency hotline for the public to call to ask questions. This is likely to occur if there is an intentional contamination event where there is high publicity and public concern. Train staff to handle these calls in a consistent manner so that the advice is the same who gives it. Faulty information derived from poorly tested hypotheses can lead to severe political, legal or economic consequences. An example of this occurred in Sydney, Australia, in 1998 when an apparent water contamination event was publicized for the public to take precautionary actions. The false alarm was costly because of rebates to water customers, additional water testing, and for hiring extra staff, as well as a loss of confidence in the facility (see Box 1, False Alarm). They may then be disseminated by the mass media with inappropriate interpretations of the public health significance. Furthermore, this information may be used as an unrealistic base for water programs or water regulations because of either misinterpretations or pressure from misinformed consumer-advocate groups. All involved parties should follow a written protocol for cross-agency communication and release of information to the public. Unreasonable delays are unacceptable.",

            "text": "Sydney Water (a New South Wales state-owned corporation) supplies 1600 million liters of water each day to 1.5 million properties in Sydney and its outlying areas. The city has a large and complex catchment with nine major dams and several storage reservoirs. About 21,000 km of water main, almost 200 pumping stations and many tunnels deliver water from four main river systems. The water is filtered through eleven treatment plants. Seven are owned by Sydney Water and four are privately owned. These plants provide 90% of Sydney's drinking water and one plant, Prospect, provides up to 80%. In 1998, the quality of Sydney's drinking water came under acute review when Giardia and Cryptosporidium were found in the city's main water supply at the Warragamba Dam. Initially, low levels of these parasites were first detected in the water supply on 21 July, but these were within the acceptable health limits. In days following, much higher levels were recorded, and on July 27 the first \"boil water\" alert (in which residents were instructed to boil their tap water before use) was declared for the eastern Central Business District of Sydney. However, by late on July 29 high readings were found in samples at the Prospect Filtration Plant, in a reservoir and at a location further down the system, and a \"boil water\" alert was issued for the south of Sydney Harbour, and on July 30 a Sydney-wide \"boil water\" alert was issued affecting most of Sydney's residents. On August 4 the warning was discontinued. However, high levels were again found on August 13 (the second event), although it was believed that most organisms would likely be dead. More positive readings were found on August 14, although at lower levels. Further contamination was identified on August 24 and an extended boil water alert was again declared. This was progressively lifted suburb by suburb until further contamination was reported on September 5 (the third event). A 2-week alert was then instituted, which was finally lifted on September 19. It was determined that the parasitic contamination was caused by low-quality surface water entering the dam. This contaminated source was attributed to moderate rainfall in July, followed by heavy rainfall in August and September which caused intermittent supplies of the raw water to enter the dam. Despite high levels of Cryptosporidium (up to >12,000 oocysts) and Giardia (up to >7600 cysts) being recorded in July and August, 1998, no increase in human cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis was detected in the exposed population.",

The economic and political repercussions were extensive. The cost of the crisis to Sydney Water was estimated at A$33 million which included $20 million paid in rebates to customers, $13 million in lost revenue, water testing and staff costs and at least $2.5 million for damages claims. These costs exclude those relating to improvements to the system and infrastructure. The lack of cases of cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis or other water-related health problems led to suggestions that the parasites were either not an infectious type, or not as extensively distributed. An inquiry after the event revealed the publicity as an exaggeration of fact, with Australian Water Technologies, part of Sydney Water, severely overestimating levels of Cryptosporidium and Giardia present in the water, with the recorded levels exposed to consumers as not harmful to human health. The handling of the crisis by State-owned Sydney Water was heavily criticized, causing the resignation of both the chairman and the managing director, and bringing up issues of private vs. public ownership and scientific uncertainty. The eventual consequence of the State Inquiry was the establishment of the Sydney Catchment Authority in 1999 to assume control of Sydney's catchments and dams, while Sydney Water maintained responsibility for water treatment and distribution and for sewage collection, treatment and disposal.",

On May 8-12, torrential rain had unknowingly contaminated the town's water system, but operators failed to check residual levels for a period of several days, allowing unchlorinated water to enter the distribution system. However, the privatelyowned Walkerton Public Utilities Commission insisted there was no problem with the water despite other laboratory tests showing evidence of E. coli contamination. Illnesses began about May 18, with the first death occurring on May 22 and the seventh and last on May 30. By May 21, however, many more cases had been diagnosed, the infectious agent determined to be E. coli O157:H7, and contaminated well water was confirmed as the source of the E. coli; all this allowed the region's Medical Officer of Health to issue a boil water advisory, warning residents not to drink the tap water. Two days later, laboratory results identified the presence of Campylobacter and E. coli O151:H7 and DNA testing showed that the contaminating source was a cattle farm a short distance from a well used for the water supply. By the time the outbreak was over, >2300 were ill and 7 had died. The people who died directly from drinking the E. coli-contaminated water might have been saved if the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission had admitted to contaminated water sooner. Those in charge of the water utilities at the Commission had no formal training in their positions, retaining their jobs through three decades of on-the-job experience. They were later found to fail to use adequate doses of chlorine, fail to monitor chlorine residuals daily, make false entries about residuals in daily operating records, and misstate the locations at which microbiological samples were taken. Regulations state that water suppliers are required to treat groundwater with chlorine to sufficiently neutralize contaminants and sustain a chlorine residual of 0.5 mg/L of water after 15 min of contact. Had utility operators adhered to the protocol, the disaster most likely would have been averted. The operators knew that these practices were unacceptable and contrary to Ministry of Environment guidelines and directives; they eventually admitted falsifying reports and were sentenced to short jail terms. The Ontario government was also blamed for not regulating water quality and not enforcing the guidelines that had been in place. The water testing had been privatized in October 1996. An enquiry found that the water supply, drawn from groundwater, became contaminated with the E. coli O157:H7 strain from manure from cattle on a farm washing into a shallow water supply well after heavy rainfall. The risk of contamination from farm runoff into the adjacent water well had been known since 1978. Key recommendations from the enquiry included source water protection as part of a comprehensive multibarrier approach, the training and certification of operators, a quality management system for water suppliers, and more competent enforcement, which were incorporated into Ontario new legislation. The bottom line of the enquiry was that officials and municipal water facilities operators and managers across North America need to recognize public waters are a most valued but vulnerable public resource. Investment in keeping them safe and secure needs to be a community top priority. from dams that could have resulted in flooding within the duration of the incubation period of the disease under investigation.",

On April 24, 2014, Flint, Genesee County, Michigan, switched its water supply from Detroit's system to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure for the struggling, majority-black city on the recommendation of the state-appointed emergency manager. Flint agreed to separate from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and go with the Karegnondi Water Authority, including the decision to pump Flint River water. This was to be an interim measure until a new pipeline from Lake Huron was constructed in 2016 to serve the region. Soon after the switch, residents begin to complain about the water's color, taste and odor, and to report rashes and concerns about bacteria. In August and September 2014 city officials issued boil-water advisories after coliform bacteria were detected in tap water. In October 2014, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) blamed the cold weather, aging pipes and a population decline.

Look for failures in the barriers, which could include (a) lack of disinfection, (b) inadequate concentration of disinfectant or contact time, (c) interruption of disinfection, (d) inadequate filtration, (e) lack of corrosion inhibitors, which may follow inadequate pre-filtration treatments. In 2015 in Flint, Michigan excessive levels of lead were found in drinking water from corrosion of water distribution pipes (see Box 3, The Flint Water Crisis). Corrosion inhibitor had not been added. Also, look for possible introduction of contaminants within the treatment process, such as in treatment chemicals. stopped using municipal water, saying it was rusting car parts. On January 4, 2015, the city announced that Flint's water contained a high level of trihalomethanes, a byproduct from increased disinfection by the city. Though this is in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act, officials told residents with normal immune systems that they have nothing to worry about. In January 2015, Detroit's water system offered to reconnect to Flint, waiving a $4 million connection fee but the offer was declined by the emergency manager. By February, State officials continued to play down any water problems saying that the water was not an imminent \"threat to public health.\" On February 18, 104 parts per billion (ppb) of lead were detected in drinking water at a Flint home and the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was notified. The EPA does not require action until levels reach 15 parts per billion, but science indicates that there is no safe level for lead in potable water. Officials from EPA and MDEQ discussed the lead level in the sample, and EPA found that the State was testing the water in a way that could profoundly understate the lead levels. On March 3, 2015, a second testing detected 397 ppb of lead in Flint drinking water. A consultant group hired by Flint, reported that the city's water met state and federal standards, and it did not specifically report on any lead levels. In May, tests revealed high lead levels in two more homes in Flint. In July, an EPA administrator told Flint's mayor that \"it would be premature to draw any conclusions\" based on a leaked internal EPA memo regarding lead. However, in September, Flint was asked to stop using the Flint water supply or consider corrosion control for it, because it was causing lead to leach from the water pipes and children had high levels in their blood. State regulators insisted the water was safe. Nevertheless, on October 1, the Governor of Michigan ordered the distribution of filters, the testing of water in schools, and the expansion of water and blood testing after a briefing on the lead problems with the MDEQ and federal officials. At the same time, Flint city officials urged residents to stop drinking water. On October 16, Flint reconnected to Detroit's water system, and residents were advised not to use unfiltered tap water for drinking, cooking or bathing. On October 19, the Director of MDEQ reported that his staff had used inappropriate federal protocol for corrosion control, and soon after, the Governor announced that an independent advisory task force would review water use and testing in Flint. On December 9 Flint added additional corrosion controls, and soon after an emergency was declared. At the end of December, the task force found that the MDEQ was accountable for its lack of appropriate action, and the Director resigned. On January 16, 2016, the Governor asked the National Guard to distribute bottled water and filters in Flint, and President Obama declared a state of emergency in the city and surrounding county, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide up to $5 million in aid.",

The source of Legionella is not known but it was likely in the Flint River, and possibly extensive flushing of Flint's colored water, which had undesirable odors and tastes, by residents may have caused chlorine residual in the pipes to be washed away, leaving the pipes susceptible to growth of the Legionella; in addition, aerosols from the extensive flushing from turned-on faucets might have led to close contact between the residents and the pathogen.

These are conventional, direct (both conventional and direct are referred to as \"rapid\" filtration), slow sand filtration, and diatomaceous earth filtration. Conventional filtration consists of a series of processes including coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. Direct filtration consists of a series of processes including coagulation and filtration but excluding sedimentation. Slow sand filtration is a process involving passage of raw water through a bed of sand at low velocity (usually less than 0.4 m/h), utilizing both physical and biological means to remove particles and microorganisms.

Adjust the flow of water so that the thiosulfate will not wash out of the bottle or bag (do not overfill-most laboratory bottles indicate a maximum fill line). Keep sample containers closed until the moment they are to be filled. Hold the bottle near the base, fill to the \"fill line\" or within an inch of the top without rinsing, and immediately replace the stopper or cap and secure the hood, if attached. If a Whirl-pak\u2122-type plastic bag is used instead of a bottle, hold the base, rip off the perforated top, open the bag by pulling the side tabs apart, grasp the end wires, and place the bag under the flowing water. Remove the bag before it is completely filled and squeeze most of the air out; fold over the top of the bag several times and secure by twisting the end wires. Take a source or a distribution line sample by opening the tap fully and letting the water run to waste for sufficient time to empty the service line (or if in doubt, for 5 min) and proceed as above.",

Although aerosol drift can carry Legionella up to 6 mi (10 km), the risk of infection is usually highest within 1600 ft (500 m) of the source. There are also air dispersion models that can be used to determine drift zone and the use of Human Activity Mapping in the identification of potential sources.",

There have been many outbreaks from produce traced to pathogens being introduced by contaminated irrigation water. Although harvested products are sometimes washed with chlorine solution, pathogens may still survive the process through internalization. E. coli O157:H7 may migrate to internal locations in plant tissue and be protected from the action of sanitizing agents by virtue of its inaccessibility. Experiments have also demonstrated that E. coli O157:H7 can enter the lettuce plant through the root system and migrate throughout the edible portion of the plant. However, this claim has been refuted by others. Salmonella and E. coli can also adhere to the surface of plants, and enter through stomata, stem and bud scars and breaks in the plant surface caused by harvesting and processing. Water containing bacteria can be drawn into the produce if it is immersed in or sprayed with water that is colder than the produce itself. E. coli O157:H7 may also use its flagella to penetrate the plant cell walls and attached to the inside of the plant. Once attached, it may be able to grow and colonize the surface of the plant.

If several people have left and their state of wellness is not known, their impact should be expressed in the form of the possible range of values around the known incidence rate within the two extremes whereby they may all be well or they may all be ill. Thus, where six children who were at the camp had departed around the time of the outbreak and their health is unknown, the range could be from a possible (14/146) \u00d7 100 (or 9.6%) if all of the six had been well, up to (20/146) \u00d7 100 (or 13.7%) if all had been ill. Note that the \"missing\" six are added to the denominator only when we speculate that none were ill, whereas they are added to the numerator AND denominator if we speculate that they might all have been ill.

This should not be interpreted automatically as implying that a given exposure would be associated with the outcome in any situation. By hypothesizing that gender was linked to the risk of illness, for example, does not imply that males are more vulnerable to the illness (the outcome) than females, but it can indicate that gender may have been related to the exposure, which in turn increased the risk. As an illustration, suppose that boys at the camp had been swimming, while the girls had gone on a nature walk. The boys may subsequently show increased incidence rate for E. coli O157 infection, not because they are more susceptible, but because of their activity. Every proportion or percentage statement should be made with clear reference to the appropriate denominator used. Incidence rates of waterborne illnesses are usually similar for both sexes at any given age group in the population, but differences in activities or dietary habits or susceptibility due to age or underlying health status can change the risk. The very young, the elderly and the immunocompromised can be at more susceptible, while in some instances, previously exposed populations may have developed a measure of immunity to an infection that may still cause more serious illness among visitors.",

This precautionary principle is a vital component of risk management in modern public health. Waiting for absolute confirmation before releasing warnings and advisories should not be an option in the twentyfirst century. The principle holds that while false alarms can be quickly forgiven, further illness should be avoided at the highest priority. Failure to heed this step has contributed to needless suffering and severe damage to reputation, trust and credibility. 1 A case-control approach is necessary because unlike the data in Table 5B , we rarely have full information about all the attendees, and therefore the true incidence/attack rate is not available.

If the ill people were found to be five times more likely to have consumed type A (odds ratio = 5.0) then the not-ill would have five times the rate of consuming water B, and only one-fifth of the rate of choosing water A (OR = 0.20 or 20%).

Two methods of testing are presented: the chi-square test (written \u03c7 2 and pronounced \"ky\"-square) for most 2 \u00d7 2 (or larger) tables, and the Fisher's Exact Test (only for 2 \u00d7 2 tables) when chi-square is not valid due to the numbers in the cells being too small (the following sections give advice about this decision).",

The chi-square test measures the difference between the O and E values. If they are close, we have to accept that there may be no real relationship; if far apart, we can reject the null hypothesis and cautiously declare that exposure and illness were probably related. Numerous online statistical calculators can be used to yield ORs, RRs, and chisquare values. 2 If you prefer to do the calculation by hand, construct a 2 \u00d7 2 table as shown, with \"observed\" data, marginal totals, and the grand total. The expected \"E\" values are found from: To make sure the chi-square analysis is appropriate for your table, you must be sure that all \"E\" numbers 3 are more than 5. The quickest way is to first calculate for the cell with the smallest E value; (this will be the cell with the smaller column total and the smaller row total.) In Table 8 , the smallest E value will be cell \"d,\" and this is calculated as (19 \u00d7 29)/89 = 6.2. As this is >5, all other E values will be greater than this, so chi-sq. is valid.

Investigators are discouraged from using it as it may produce misleading results. The exposurerate table for cases and controls is preferred in all case-control studies, and compares the rates of exposure to each factor between both the ill and non-ill people. Table 13 displays six exposure factors from a hypothetical outbreak involving water contamination. Exposure rates are calculated from both cases and controls. The \"spring-water\" data that we used for the odds ratio calculation example in Table 8 appears as the first exposure in Table 11 . The column headed \"Differences in exposure rates\" subtracts the exposure rate among the non-ill from the exposure rate among the ill. [Use: Exp. rate (cases) minus Exp. rate (controls), keeping the signs correct]. You are looking for a large positive difference to indicate the most likely culprit. The spring water shows the largest positive difference at +45%. The odds ratio of 15.0 supports this, again the largest value, indicating that ill persons were 15 times more likely to have drunk the spring water compared to non-ill persons in this group. Hence both the large positive difference in exposure rates and the large odds ratio point to the spring water being the likely source of the illness, and it is certainly the strongest association between illness and any of the exposures shown.

First, tests for pathogens are pathogen-specific, expensive, and often difficult to perform because they may require specialized trained personnel. Secondly, the etiologic agent of the outbreak is often unknown at the time of analysis; hence, many analyses would have to be done blindly. Thirdly, pathogens are not always recovered because they are heterogeneously dispersed and diluted in the environment, and their numbers decline in water over time. As a result, they may be absent or present in low densities by the time samples are collected following an outbreak. Fourthly, recovery efficiencies are often poor because microorganisms are stressed by disinfectants or the method is sensitive to interferences from the source waters environment, hence not easily recovered by routine methods. Additionally, recovery efficiencies for viruses and protozoa may be poor because of the interferences of substances within the sample matrix with method reagents (concentrating 1800 L of water down to 200 \u03bcL will also concentrate inhibitory chemicals and substances). Finally, the time required for isolation and identification is often long, and the number of samples is usually too small to allow the investigator to have much statistical confidence in the results when pathogens are not found.",

Procedures used for many bacterial pathogens are qualitative because enrichment procedures are used. Quantitative procedures (e.g., MPN) require considerable work and are less reliable than those used for coliforms because small populations may be present, and these may be unevenly distributed. Despite these difficulties, pathogens that cause a syndrome similar to the one being investigated should be sought. See Tables B, C, and D, for descriptions of the disease syndrome associated with the pathogens described in the following material.
