During a long period starting from Jan, 2020, shortage of hospital beds for COVID-19 was a serious public concern in Wuhan. It has been reported that the Fangcang shelter hospitals could be a powerful component of national responses to the pandemic, because these instant facilitates could rapidly increase the bed capacity of whole city (Chen et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, at the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, the number of COVID-19 patients dramatically increased so that six batches of designated hospitals were forced to operate continuously in order to take care of the patients. From Jan 21 st to Mar 6 th , 2020, a total of 86 hospitals were transformed to accept fever/COVID-19 patients only. Wuhan Red Cross Hospital (WRCH), a general hospital and a trusteeship hospital of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, happened to be the first one in these designated hospitals that turned into a healthcare system specialized in treating COVID-19 patients.",

Five passageways including patient channel, employee channel, administrative personnel channel, cleaning personnel channel and sewage channel were established to meet the requirements of hospital infection protection. Second, search for all kinds of personal protective equipment actively such as fit-tested N95 respirator and protective clothing from local and government resources. Moreover, to minimize transmission, a surgical mask was given to each patient. Third, urgently purchasing medical rescue equipment such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, mechanical ventilators, liquid oxygen tanks providing ample oxygen, and negative-pressure isolation system to support the treatment. Fourth, training all medical staff with infectious disease hospital instructions for self-protection and COVID-19 treatment with a standard protocol of Chinese Guideline. Fifth, to increase the bed capacity and reduce cross infection, patients without fever were all discharged within 24 hours, allowing hundreds of fever patients admitted the next day. Sixth, recruiting more doctors and nurses specialized in infectious and respiratory disease. Fortunately, expert teams from Wuhan Union Hospital and Sichuan province came to strengthen the treatment forces. Seventh, rebuiding two intensive care units as there were abundant critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring advance therapies such as mechanical ventilation and ECMO (MacLaren et al., 2020b) . Eighth, we explored building regional coalition, a network of tertiary care centers and community hospitals, to coordinate other hospitals and health systems for transferring the COVID-19 patients. Ninth, establishing a telehealth network to perform multidisciplinary team consultation for COVID-19 patients both in our hospital system and between different hospitals. Tenth, a rear service team formed, including both our administrative staff and social volunteers, working together with greatest efforts to fully ensure the clothing, food, housing, travel and safety of key frontline personnel and steady operation of the hospital (Montemurro, 2020) . With Steps 1 and 3 recently endorsed (Chopra et al., 2020) , we now summarize all emergency management strategies in Figure 1 .",
