Viral loads peaked in the BAL and infected right lung 3 DPI and in the uninfected left lung and blood 7 DPI, followed by cessation of viral replication 14 DPI (Fig. 1a). In line with viral replication kinetics, the lungs showed severe focal hemorrhaging and firm nodules 7 DPI, which resolved 14 DPI (Fig. 1b). Similarly, H&E staining revealed damage to the alveolar walls and perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages that peaked 7\u201310 DPI, indicative of viral pneumonia, which also resolved 14 DPI (Fig. 1c). To determine the association between viral replication and viral antigen, lung tissue slides were stained with anti-VZVgB (which shares 71% amino acid identity with SVVgB). As described for viral DNA loads, VZVgB staining peaked 7 DPI (Fig. 1d).",

The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) correlated tightly with viral loads, with the highest number of DEGs detected 7 DPI (Fig. 5a and Supplemental Datasets S1\u20134). Changes in gene expression were validated for a subset of genes using qRT-PCR (Supplemental Fig. S1). The 54 DEGs that were differentially expressed 3, 7 and 10 DPI (Fig. 5b) segregated into 3 clusters. Cluster 1 contained 30 DEGs whose expression gradually increased until it peaked 10 DPI (Fig. 5c). Several of these genes are involved in cell cycle such as cyclin kinase subunit 2 (CKS2), Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2 (RRM2), and topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A). Cluster 2 contained 7 DEGs whose expression was substantially increased as early as 3 DPI and remained high until 10 DPI before decreasing back to baseline 14 DPI (Fig. 5d). Several of these DEGs play a role in antiviral defense such as granzyme A (GZMA), GZMB, 2\u2032-5\u2032-Oligoadenylate Synthetase-Like (OASL), and CXCL9. Cluster 3 contained 15 genes that remained down-regulated throughout acute infection (Fig. 5e). These genes are involved in several cellular processes such as migration (fascin actin-bundling protein 1, FSCN1), division (Glypican 1, GPC1), and tight junction organization (nectin-1, PVRL1, an alpha herpesvirus entry mediator8). To gain a better understanding of the biological implications of the gene expression changes we detected, functional enrichment of DEGs that have human homologs was carried out using Metacore software.",

This analysis showed that a group of genes that play a role in the cell cycle progression (e.g. Top2a, BUB1, CEP55, SPC25 and CENPF) were highly expressed by B cells, dendritic cells and T cells (Supplemental Fig. S2, cluster 1). We also identified 2 additional clusters of genes that were mainly expressed by MACs (e.g. ADAMDEC1, IgJ, SIGLEC1, CXCL9 and CXCL10) (Supplemental Fig. S2, cluster 2a,b). Two small clusters are expressed by NK cells (e.g. GZMB, GZMA and SAMD3) (Supplemental Fig. S2 cluster 3a,b), and an additional cluster of antiviral genes was seen in the neutrophils (e.g. DDX60, OAS2, and RASD2) (Supplemental Fig. S2, cluster 4).

In this study, we leveraged a robust model of VZV infection wherein rhesus macaques are intrabronchially infected with the homologue SVV to carry out the first in depth analysis of the host-pathogen interactions during acute varicella infection in the lungs using a combination of immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, multiplex ELISA, and RNA sequencing. Our analyses show for the first time that SVV spreads rapidly through the lungs replicating both within the lung parenchyma as well as BAL immune cells. We also report the down-regulation of genes important for lung function, indicative of lung injury during the acute phase of infection. Immune responses and changes in gene expression tightly correlate with viral loads with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ISGs, chemokines and granzyme genes at peak viral loads. In contrast, genes associated with cell cycle and lung repair were up-regulated after cessation of viral replication.",

Bioinformatic analysis of DEGs detected 3\u201310 DPI using ImmGen also indicate that transcriptional changes are mediated by T cells, B cells, DCs, MACs, neutrophils and NK cells 3 and 7 DPI, with a bigger contribution of DCs, MACs, and neutrophils 7 DPI.

Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 also significantly increased in the BAL. These factors have been reported during other lung infections suggesting a common defense response to respiratory pathogens. For instance, IL-18 has been shown to activate NK cells and stimulate IFN\u03b3 production during influenza infection in the lungs46. Increases in IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 have also been observed in nasopharyngeal lavage samples taken from influenza patients, BAL samples taken from flu infected rhesus macaques, and BAL samples from rhesus macaques infected with pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria474849. The sources of these factors could be alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells as previously reported during influenza infection and lung injury5051. Indeed, ImmGen analysis also shows IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 to be highly expressed by MACs. Interestingly, no chemokines or cytokines were increased in the lung homogenate, suggesting that immune mediators are quickly secreted into the alveolar space and do not remain within the lung parenchyma. In support of this hypothesis, mRNA transcripts of CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10, CXCL11 (ITAC), IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 within lung homogenates were significantly increased.

Another source of IFN\u03b1 could be epithelial cells, which, like pDCs, express the double stranded DNA sensor TLR952, and could secrete type 1 interferons in a RIG-I dependent manner as described for RSV infection53. Alternatively, IFN\u03b1 could also be secreted by alveolar macrophages, which were the primary producers of IFN\u03b1 in mice infected with Newcastle disease virus54. Concomitant with the increased IFN\u03b1 levels in the BAL, we detected a significant up-regulation of the transcription factor STAT1, induced by type 1 and 2 interferons 3 DPI11. STAT-1 in turn regulates the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which play a critical role in inhibiting viral replication. Indeed, ISGs were among the most highly up-regulated genes in our data set (average FC = 18). The increased expression of ISGs persists until 10 DPI and correlates with decreased viral loads 10 and 14 DPI. Our observations are similar to those described for influenza and RSV where increased expression of ISG15, RIGI, IRF1, CXCL10, CXCL11, IFIT1 and STAT1 have been shown to play a role in disease resolution555657.

Increased expression of GRMZ genes correlated with increased frequency of EM CD8 T cells and was confirmed by IHC staining. Bioinformatic analysis using ImmGen also confirmed that GZMA and GZMB was highest in NK and T cells 3\u201310 DPI. We previously reported increased GRMZB levels within BAL-resident CD4 and CD8 T cells during SVV infection7. Elevated GRZMA and GRZMB expression have also been reported during RSV and influenza A infection6162. Moreover, increased expression of GRZMK during acute lung inflammation can in turn induce IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2 production63. Both mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were increased during acute varicella 3 DPI. Together with previous reports, data reported in this study suggest that the lung generates a similar response to respiratory viral pathogens lead by ISGs, granzymes, similar chemokines and cytokines followed by an infiltration of B and T cells.",

This damage is likely caused by both the anti-viral immune response as well as viral replication as previously described for influenza64. Indeed, the damage was most severe at the peak of viral loads and immune response (7 DPI). For instance, expression of IRX3 (3 DPI), important for lung development and airspace maintenance12 and SEC14-like 3 (7 DPI), which plays a critical role in preventing lung collapse28, were significantly down-regulated by SVV infection. Similarly, down-regulation of TNNT1 (10 DPI) has been proposed as a cause of acute respiratory distress65. Moreover, genes that play a role in controlling lung inflammation were down-regulated such as SCGB3A1 (10 DPI), which regulates airway inflammation and tissue repair66. Interestingly, type 1 and 2 interferons, which were increased 3 and 7 DPI, have been shown to decrease SCGB3A1 expression67. Similarly, IRS2, which interacts with IL-4 and acts as an anti-inflammatory agent in the lungs27, was also down-regulated (7 DPI).",

Indeed, analysis using ImmGen indicates that these genes are most highly expressed by T cells. Significant increase in expression of cell cycle genes was also observed in mice recovering from MRSA-induced pneumonia68. The up-regulated cell cycle genes could also indicate the beginning of the repair process in the lungs since young immune competent rhesus macaques resolve primary varicella infection without complication. In line with that hypothesis, we detected an increase in growth factors VEGF and PDGF-BB, and angiogenic factor VEGF-A 10 and 14 DPI, which have been shown to play a critical role in alveolarization in the lungs and repairing damaged alveolar walls6970. Interestingly, several genes involved with lung function remained down-regulated 10 DPI and 14 DPI, suggesting that repair continues after cessation of viral replication.

            "text": "In summary, data from this study provides the first kinetic analysis of host-pathogen interactions within the lungs during acute varicella infection. A robust immune response led by interferon-stimulated genes, granzymes, cytokines and chemokines is critical for the resolution of infection. These data also show that although SVV infection in young macaques is self-limiting, significant lung injury occurs during the acute phase as a result of the immune response and viral replication, a phenomenon that has not previously been described. Our results provide potential insights to both what happens in a self \u2013resolving infection, and by extension, what may be happening when infection results in severe complications. Specifically, our RNA sequencing data show reduced expression of genes important for lung function during peak viral replication. In immune deficient individuals who lack the vigorous immune response, uncontrolled viral replication could lead to sustained reduction in the expression of these critical genes, which in turn results in severe lung damage and viral pneumonia. Furthermore, immune genes that are significantly up-regulated likely play a critical role in resolving infection; therefore, lack of increased expression of these genes may explain why the immunocompromised develop severe disease. On the other hand, adults may generate too vigorous of an immune response that results in severe inflammation and viral pneumonia. These data help design interventions to mitigate complications associated with VZV pneumonia and other infectious respiratory diseases.",
