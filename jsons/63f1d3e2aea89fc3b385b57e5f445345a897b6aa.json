On a commercial farrow-to-finish farm, five experimental groups were formed, each of 54 weaned piglets. The pigs of the first group (double controls) received normal feed with no probiotic and the pigs of the second group (untreated controls) received BioPlus 2B only during the weaning stage. The pigs of the third, the fourth and the fifth group received the same as the second group feed but, at the growing and at a part of the finishing stages, supplemented with three different doses of Bioplus 2B, a low, medium and high dose, respectively. The results have shown that, compared with the double controls, BioPlus 2B-treated pigs had a lower morbidity and mortality during the whole trial period, compared with the double controls (range from 9.26 to 14.81% versus 25.93% and from 0.00 to 3.70% versus 11.1%, respectively), as a result of the lower incidence of post-weaning diarrhoea due mainly to Escherichia coli. Weight gain, feed conversion ratio and carcass quality of the BioPlus 2B-treated pigs were significantly improved compared with the double controls, whilst the beneficial effects of the probiotic were more pronounced when the medium and high doses were used.",

Microorganisms such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains, Salmonella spp., clostridia, spirochaetes (including Brachyspira hyodysenteriae), Lawsonia intracellularis, Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus and coronaviruses are agents potentially causing scours from weaning up to the end of fattening period (Taylor, 1995) . To prevent or control post-weaning diarrhoea, antibiotics in the weaners and growers ration have been used as growth promoters with good results (Kyriakis et al., 1995 (Kyriakis et al., , 1996 (Kyriakis et al., , 1997 . The antibiotics as growth promoters appear to act by reducing the pathogenic bacteria and modifying the microflora in the gut of the animal (Radostits et al., 1994) . However, concern for the presence of drug residues in edible animal products and the potential transfer of antibiotic resistance to human pathogens has increased by such administration (Meng, 2003) . For these reasons, alternative solutions, aiming at both the safety of the consumer and the profitability of the farmer, are always welcomed.",

They are live cultures of harmless bacteria or yeast species (e.g. Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Saccharomyces, etc.) that equilibrate intestinal microflora to the benefit of the animal (Fuller, 1989 (Fuller, , 1992 Ferencik et al., 2000) . They may have a growth promoting activity by competing with harmful gut flora, and by stimulating the immune system of the animal and therefore increasing the body resistance to infectious agents (Tannock, 1988; Khajarern and Khajarern, 1994; Perdigon et al., 2002; Benyacoub et al., 2003) . The positive effect of probiotics on the control of certain pathogens in animals has been shown in only few studies, where they appear to control enteric diseases associated with E. coli or other enteric pathogens, one of which is post-weaning diarrhoea syndrome (PWDS) in pigs (Kozasa, 1983; Khajarern and Khajarern, 1994; Kyriakis et al., 1999) . Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that, because of their property to modulate gut microflora in favour of the animal, probiotics may also exhibit a growth-enhancing activity (Lyons, 1987) .",

Additional support of this diagnosis was provided by microbiology. From the results of the present study it was shown that in-feed B. licheniformis and B. subtilis, strongly tended to reduce the morbidity, as well as the mortality of pigs associated with E. coli diarrhoea in weaners. This finding is in agreement with previous reports shown that probiotics have a positive effect on PWDS (Kyriakis et al., 1999) , as well as on other diarrhoeas (Breton and Munoz, 1998; Candy et al., 2000; Marcin et al., 2000) . The beneficial effect of the probiotic used in the present study can be explained by the decrease of pathogens locally in the gut, brought about by the ingestion of the probiotics, which did not allow increased proliferation of harmful bacteria (Vandevoorde et al., 1992; Alvarez et al., 1996) . However, the exact mechanism by which B. licheniformis and B. subtilis acted in the gut still remains unclear, e.g. whether this was due to competition for receptors on gut mucosa, competition for nutrients, production of antibacterial substances, stimulation of immunity or/and other mechanisms (Fuller, 1989; Perdigon et al., 1990; Rodriguez-Ropon et al., 1998) .",

An important index for evaluating a product, and one, which is of utmost importance for the farmer, is the animal performance. In the present study, several efficacy parameters of treated animals (ADG and FCR), particularly those of the groups that received the medium and the high dose of the probiotic, were superior to those seen in double controls. For example, during the growing stage, ADG in the medium and the high dose groups was 6.4% and 7.2% higher than that of the double controls and for the total fattening period they both were 3.6% higher. Additionally, during the growing stage, FCR in the medium and the high dose groups was 8.8% and 9.2% lower than that of the double controls and for the total fattening period they were 5.4% and 5.0%, lower, respectively. These figures are of particular significance for the farmer considering that, the continuous use of growth promoters during weaning-to-slaughter period is not expected to confer improvement in efficacy parameters higher than 5% (Buttery, 1993) . Furthermore, the significantly higher proportions of carcasses classified in the top two categories of the SEUROP scale (S and E) that were obtained in pigs receiving the medium and high dose of the probiotic, gives an additional benefit to the farmer. A possible explanation for the benefit after the administration of the probiotic during the growing stage and a short-time at the beginning of the finishing period could be that microflora balance in the gut of these animals is optimized -as is the case in weaners -and a better utilization of nutrients is taking place, thereby leading to faster metabolism and transformation of feed into body mass (ADG, FCR) and transformation into lean meat. However, such an explanation is just a hypothesis, as there is no data available from the current literature to correlate necessarily the high growth rates of pigs during the nursery and growing periods with high lean yield at the end of finishing period.",

Licheniformis and B. subtilis per g of feed from weaning up to the age of 120 days, can (a) prophylactically reduce the morbidity and the mortality in recently weaned piglets, (b) improve the performance parameters of the fattening pigs and (c) improve the carcass quality, to the economic benefit of the farmer. Finally, as probiotics are generally considered to be harmless, the findings of this study further support the view that the use of antimicrobials both for competing scours problems in pigs and for promoting growth of the animals can be reduced, in this way minimizing the risks for public health (drug residues and antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria).",

            "text": "However, the results from the use of probiotics are not always consistent (Stavric et al., 1995; Kritas and Morrison, 2003) . Personal experience and mainly unpublished communication with scientists and farmers shows that probiotic preparates do not always provide benefits in pigs. It is true that systematic knowledge on these immunomodulators is rather shallow. Therefore, wide variations in protocol designs, in tested commensal microorganisms and pathogens, in target animal species, and in health status of farms may account for significant variability in results. However, inconsistency of results is a characteristic of every new development. Our opinion is that probiotics are not a panacea and should be used after critical thinking. They can be introduced in cases similar to that described as successful in literature. If novel applications are sought, limited number of pigs should be used and the product should be tested. Failure does not necessarily mean that probiotics do not work. Their effect is dependent on several factors as previously mentioned. A trial-and-error thinking should be practiced at least in the first years of investigating their effect. Their potential to substitute for antibiotics in simple illnesses and to produce \u00d4ecological\u00d5 pork may also guide practitioners\u00d5 decisions. ",
