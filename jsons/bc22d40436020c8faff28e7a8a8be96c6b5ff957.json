            "text": "Human LSECtin (liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin, CLEC4G) is a C-type lectin encoded within the L-SIGN/DC-SIGN/CD23 gene cluster. LSECtin acts as a pathogen attachment factor for Ebolavirus and the SARS coronavirus, and its expression can be induced by interleukin-4 on monocytes and macrophages. Although reported as a liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell-specific molecule, LSECtin could be detected in the MUTZ-3 dendritic-like cell line at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level, and immunohistochemistry analysis on human liver revealed its presence in Kupffer cells coexpressing the myeloid marker CD68. The expression of LSECtin in myeloid cells was further corroborated through the analysis of the proximal regulatory region of the human LSECtin gene, whose activity was maximal in LSECtin\u0609 myeloid cells, and which contains a highly conserved PU.1binding site. PU.1 transactivated the LSECtin regulatory region in collaboration with hematopoietic-restricted transcription factors (Myb, RUNX3), and was found to bind constitutively to the LSECtin proximal promoter. Moreover, knockdown of PU.1 through the use of small interfering RNA led to a decrease in LSECtin mRNA levels in THP-1 and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, thus confirming the involvement of PU.1 in the myeloid expression of the lectin. Conclusion: LSECtin is expressed by liver myeloid cells, and its expression is dependent on the PU.1 transcription factor. (HEPATOLOGY 2009;49:287-296.)",

DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, and LSECtin function as endocytic receptors and mediate binding and internalization of clinically relevant viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. 5, 6 CD23 is expressed on myeloid cells and activated B lymphocytes, where it functions as a low affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E and plays a role in limiting the extent of immunoglobulin E-mediated pathologies. 7, 8 DC-SIGN is expressed on myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), 1, 9 alternatively activated in vitro macrophages, 10 interstitial DCs, 11 a subset of CD14\u03e9 peripheral blood DCs, 12 and macrophages from various tissues, [13] [14] [15] whereas L-SIGN is exclusively expressed on endothelial cells of the liver, lymph nodes, and placenta. 16, 17 Although reported to be exclusively expressed on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells, 4 LSECtin has been later found to be expressed in ex vivo isolated human peripheral blood and thymic DCs, as well as in DCs and alternatively activated macrophages generated in vitro. 5 The carbohydrate specificity of LSECtin has been recently determined, 18 and a scavenging function has been proposed because of its ability to recognize glycoproteins with truncated complex and hybrid N-linked glycans terminating in GlcNAcMan.",

Kupffer cells exhibit a strong endocytic activity and actively scavenge plasma proteins and potentially hazardous microorganisms from the blood to maintain tissue homeostasis, 20 a function dependent on the large array of scavenger receptors exposed on their cell surface. 21 In fact, Kupffer cells mediate the removal of particulate material from the portal circulation. 22 The presence of LSECtin in myeloid cell subsets 5 prompted us to clarify its cell distribution in liver cells. We report that LSECtin is expressed in human Kupffer cells, where its expression correlates with the presence of the myeloid-restricted CD68 molecule. Moreover, PU.1 binds in vivo to the human LSECtin proximal promoter, and PU.1 protein levels determine the extent of LSECtin messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Therefore, PU.1 contributes to the myeloid expression of LSECtin, which constitutes a novel addition to the arsenal of scavenging molecules expressed by liver Kupffer cells.",

Each transfection experiment was performed at least three times with different DNA preparations. Transfection efficiencies were normalized via cotransfection with the pCMV-\u2424gal plasmid, and \u2424-galactosidase levels were determined using the Galacto-Light kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The LSECtin-based reporter gene constructs pCLEC4G-591, pCLEC4G-296, and pCLEC4G-247 were generated via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the -591/\u03e916, \u03ea296/\u03e916 and \u03ea247/\u03e916 fragments of the LSECtin promoter with oligonucleotides 5\u0408-CCAAGCTTGGAAAACTAAGGCTTCTAGAA-GC-3\u0408, 5\u0408-CCAAGCTTGGTGACTAA GCTC-CAAAGAGAAG-3\u0408, and 5\u0408-GGGGTACCCGA-TGCAGGCACCCAGTCC-3\u0408, and the resulting fragments cloned into HindIII and KpnI-digested pXP2 plasmid. 27 Positions within the LSECtin regulatory regions were numbered from the predicted transcriptional start site. The PU.1 expression plasmids for human PU.1, RUNX3, and Myb have been described. 26 THP-1 cells or MDDCs (2 \u03eb 10 6 cells) were nucleofected with 3 g of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for PU.1 (sc-36330 PU.1 siRNA gene silencer; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a control siRNA (sc-37007 Control siRNA-A, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using the Cell Line Nucleofector kit V for THP-1 and the Human Dendritic Cell Nucleofector kit for MDDCs (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). After nucleofection, cells were kept in culture for 24 hours, and one-fifth of the cells were lysed and underwent western blotting for PU.1 detection. Total RNA was isolated from the remaining nucleofected cells and subjected to real-time PCR for the detection of LSECtin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the LSECtin promoter construct pCLEC4G-296Luc using the QuikChange System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

The LSECtin-specific ADS1 and ADS4 antisera stained cells with a dendritic-like appearance within liver sinusoids, a morphology consistent with Kupffer cells (Fig. 2 ). Parallel analysis with myeloid cellspecific and endothelial cell-specific markers revealed that anti-CD31 exclusively stained sinusoidal endothelial cells, whereas anti-CD68 and anti-PU.1 antibodies only marked intrasinusoidal Kupffer cells (Fig. 2) . Comparison of the staining patterns revealed that LSECtin-specific antisera recognized Kupffer cells as well as other cells lining the hepatic sinusoids (Fig. 2) , suggesting that LSECtin can be found in both Kupffer cells and other cells in the sinusoid wall. The presence of LSECtin on CD68\u03e9 macrophages was also suggested upon analysis of human lymph node sections, where LSECtin staining differed from that of anti-CD31 and anti-factor VIII (endotheli-um-specific) and resembled the tissue staining pattern yielded by a factor XIII-specific antibody (macrophage/ DC-specific) (Fig. 3A) . Moreover, LSECtin-positive cells were preferentially observed in lymph node areas enriched in CD68\u03e9 macrophages ( Fig. 3B-C) . Double-labeling experiments confirmed the presence of LSECtin in CD68\u03e9 cells (Fig. 4) , indicating the presence of LSECtin in Kupffer cells. Further support for the presence of LSECtin in Kupffer cells was obtained via RT-PCR on RNA isolated from human hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, Ito cells, and Kupffer cells. LSECtin mRNA could be exclusively amplified from Kupffer RNA, which showed considerably higher levels of both CD68 and PU.1 transcripts than the other cell types (Fig. 4B) . Therefore, immunohistochemistry on human liver sections and RT-PCR on isolated hepatic cell types revealed that LSECtin is preferentially expressed by myeloid CD68\u03e9 PU.1\u03e9 Kupffer cells in the human liver.",

The expression of LSECtin in myeloid cells 5 and the similar pattern of staining yielded by anti-LSECtin and anti-PU.1 antibodies on human liver tissue (Fig. 2) suggest that PU.1 could participate in the restricted expression of LSECtin. This hypothesis was supported by the presence of three potential Ets-binding sequences (TTCCTTC-CTTCC) at position \u03ea66 within the LSECtin gene proximal regulatory region (Fig. 5A) . In fact, alignment of the corresponding proximal regulatory regions of the human, murine, and rat LSECtin genes evidenced that this putative Ets-binding sequence is highly conserved (Fig. 5A) . Evaluation of the activity of the LSECtin gene proximal regulatory region revealed that three distinct constructs exhibit promoter activity well above the promoterless pXP2 plamid (Fig. 5B ). More importantly, the activity of the three constructs was significantly higher in cells of myeloid origin and with the ability to express LSECtin (THP-1) than in erythroleukemic (K562) and T lymphoid cells (Jurkat), which do not express LSECtin (Fig.  5B) . Therefore, the proximal regulatory region of the LSECtin promoter preferentially functions within a myeloid context, providing a molecular explanation for the presence of the lectin in normal and leukemic myeloid cells. The relevance of the \u03ea66 putative Ets-binding element in LSECtin promoter activity was evaluated after mutation of the three putative Ets cognate sequences in the context of the pCLEC4G \u03ea296Luc construct. As shown in Fig. 5C , pCLEC4G-296/-66MUTLuc construct exhibited significantly lower activity in the THP-1 myeloid cell line than the wild-type pCLEC4G \u03ea296Luc construct (P \u03fd 10 \u03ea4 ), while mutation of the putative Ets-binding site at \u03ea99 did not affect LSECtin proximal promoter activity (Fig. 5C) . These results indicate that the preferential activity of the LSECtin gene regulatory region in myeloid cells is partly dependent on the integrity of the sequence around \u03ea66, which includes three potential binding sites for Ets family members.",

In agreement with its preferential activity in myeloid cells, both Myb and RUNX3 transactivated the LSECtin regulatory region in a nonhematopoietic cellular context (Fig. 6A ). More importantly, PU.1 overexpression enhanced the LSECtin promoter activity in the presence of RUNX3 (Fig. 6A) , although it reduced the transactivation ability of c-Myb (Fig. 6A) . Therefore, PU.1 positively modulates the LSECtin promoter activity in the presence of transcription factors which, like RUNX3, are preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells. The positive regulatory action of PU.1 on the LSECtin promoter was mainly exerted via the \u03ea66 Ets element, because its mutation reduced RUNX3/PU.1 transactivation by more than 50% (Fig. 6B ). Considering the above results, we decided to determine whether the LSECtin regulatory region was actually occupied by PU.1 in vivo. To that end, genomic DNA from LSECtin\u03e9 MDDCs was subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation with an anti-PU.1 polyclonal antiserum. The LSECtin promoter was readily amplified in the anti-PU.1-precipitated DNA, whereas no amplification was detected in the DNA brought down by a control antibody or in the absence of antibody (Fig.  6C) . The presence of two distinct bands derived from the LSECtin promoter (Fig. 6C) is explained by the presence and Jurkat cells were transfected with the indicated reporter plasmids, and luciferase activity was determined after 24 hours. Promoter activity is expressed relative to the activity produced by the promoterless pXP2 plasmid in each cell type and after normalization for transfection efficiency. Data represent the mean \u03ee SD of four independent experiments using two different DNA preparations. (C) THP-1 cells were transfected with the indicated reporter plasmids, and luciferase activity was determined after 24 hours. Promoter activity is expressed relative to the activity produced by the wild-type pCLEC4G \u03ea296Luc construct after normalization for transfection efficiency. Data represent the mean \u03ee SD of four independent experiments. of a direct repeat within the LSECtin proximal regulatory region (Fig. 5A) . Therefore, LSECtin expression correlates with that of the PU.1 transcription factor, which binds to and enhances the activity of the LSECtin proximal regulatory region in LSECtin-expressing cells of myeloid origin.",

On the other hand, the pattern of expression of DC-SIGN and LSECtin, together with the presence of DC-SIGNR on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, 3,17 provides support for a role of this family of C-type lectins in the scavenging function of the liver. Such a function can be inferred from a large list of pathogenic and endogenous ligands of DC-SIGN 33 and by the restricted sugar specificity of LSECtin. 18 Kupffer cells constitute more than 80% of the tissue macrophages present in the body and are the first macrophage population exposed to material derived from the gastrointestinal tract. 19 The removal of bacteria-derived products and microbial debris by Kupffer cells is mediated through a large array of scavenging molecules on their cell surface, and LSECtin could be an additional molecule engaged in their clearance function. The ability of LSECtin to interact with virally encoded molecules and glycoproteins with truncated complex and hybrid N-linked glycans 18 suggests its role as a scavenging molecule. Moreover, biochemical studies using recombinant LSECtin indicates its ability to specifically interact with serum proteins (data not shown). On the other hand, and by analogy with DC-SIGN, 34 LSECtin could be also implicated in cell-cell adhesion. If so, LSECtin might participate in either attachment of Kupffer cells to liver sinusoidal cells or in Kupffer cell interactions with Ito cells, a process that has proven relevant during liver tissue injury and repair. 35, 36 The data in the present manuscript may help resolving the issue of the cellular distribution of LSECtin in liver tissue. The immunochemical colocalization of CD68 and LSECtin in Kupffer cells is compatible with the PU.1 dependency of the LSECtin expression, since PU.1 is ex-pressed by Kupffer cells, 37 which are characterized by the expression of the PU.1-dependent CD68 gene. 38, 39 However, immunohistochemistry also revealed the existence of LSECtin-expressing cells that were devoid of CD68. Therefore, and based on data from previous reports, it is possible that LSECtin can be expressed by myeloid (Kupffer) and nonmyeloid (sinusoidal endothelial) cells. A similar conclusion has been reached for a number of scavenger and lectin receptors expressed on human lymph node sinuses. 40 Along this line, the mannose receptor, whose expression in myeloid cells is PU.1-dependent, 41 is expressed on both liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, 42 and its absence from myeloid cells appears to trigger a compensatory enhancement of its expression on liver sinusoidal cells. 43 Therefore, the expression of LSECtin on two distinct liver cell types might be indicative that its sugar-binding specificity and internalization capability contributes to both arms of the innate response: scavenging and antigen-presentation.",

It is therefore possible that a threshold level of PU.1 is required for both lectins to be expressed, and that IL-4 might induce their expression primarily through an increase in PU.1 expression. Alternatively, IL-4 might activate a signaling pathway/transcription factor that ultimately synergizes with PU.1 for the induction of both lectins. An obvious potential candidate would be STAT6, which functionally collaborates with PU.1, appears to bind to the CD23 gene regulatory region, and whose transcriptional activity is induced by IL-4. 44 However, no obvious STAT6-binding sequences are located within the LSECtin proximal regulatory region, and STAT6 does not influence the activity of the DC-SIGN promoter in spite of the presence of three elements with STAT6-binding ability in vitro (data not shown). A second potential factor that might participate in the IL-4 inducibility of LSECtin expression is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u2425), whose activity and expression is controlled by IL-4. 45 In fact, PPAR\u2425 expression is currently considered as a hallmark for the alternative activation of macrophages, 46, 47 which results in the induction of both LSECtin 5 and DC-SIGN. 10 However, the synthetic PPAR\u2425 ligand GW7845, or the PPAR antagonist inhibitor GW9662, did not modify the basal or inducible expression of either LSECtin or DC-SIGN (data not shown), thus arguing against a role for PPAR\u2425 in the control of the expression of both lectins.",

Unlike DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR, an obvious murine orthologue of LSECtin gene (Clec4g) has been mapped between the DC-SIGN-related cd209a and cd23 murine genes. Given its recognition specificity and internalization capability, LSECtin constitutes an additional scavenger molecule present on liver myeloid cells whose specific range of endogenous and pathogenic ligands needs to be determined. The conservation of the LSECtin gene in other mammals suggests that it might play a relevant and nonredundant function and will allow the generation of animal models in which both issues can be addressed.",
