During the first two decades of the procedure\u2019s history, liver transplantation led by Starzl and Sir Roy Calne of Cambridge encountered almost insurmountable challenges, including complexity of surgical technique, primitive anesthesia and intensive care, less-than-adequate immunosuppression and organ preservation, and devastating infection. The number of procedures performed was relatively few, and the success rate was low. However, their keen observations on these early clinical experiences laid the foundation of modern liver transplantation (Starzl and Putnam 1969; Calne 1983).",

In the 1980s, venovenous bypass was introduced to maintain better hemodynamic stability (Shaw et al. 1984), cyclosporine was found to be a superior immunosuppressant to azathioprine, and anesthesiologists answered important clinical questions, including those relating to the monitoring and treatment of coagulopathy, hemodynamic changes, and the role of the electrolyte imbalance. In the 1990s, FK506 (tacrolimus) became the immunosuppressant of choice (Starzl et al. 1989), University of Wisconsin solution was introduced to extend the safe cold ischemia time to 24 h (Kalayoglu et al. 1988), and the piggyback technique simplified surgery in select patients (Tzakis et al. 1989). In the past 15 years, liver transplantation has been performed in most major medical centers with a 1-year survival rate of greater than 85 %, and living donor liver transplantation has become a valuable alternative.",

            "text": "The liver has a unique dual blood supply: arterial supply from the hepatic artery, a branch of the celiac axis, and venous supply from the portal vein formed by the union of the splenic and superior mesenteric vein. Despite liver mass constituting only 2.5 % of the total body weight, the total hepatic blood flow is approximately 100 mL/100 g/min, or 25 % of cardiac output. The hepatic artery supplies approximately 25\u201330 % of hepatic blood flow and 45\u201350 % of the oxygen requirement, while the portal vein supplies 70\u201375 % of hepatic blood flow and 50\u201355 % of oxygen. The venous drainage is through the right, middle, and left hepatic veins, which merge into the IVC. The valveless portal vein is a low pressure/low resistance circuit, while the hepatic artery is a high pressure/high resistance system. Hepatic blood flow is primarily regulated by local metabolic demand with an inverse relationship between portal venous and hepatic arterial flow: an increase in the hepatic adenosine level triggered by a reduced portal venous flow increases hepatic arterial blood flow (Gelman and Ernst 1977; Lautt et al. 1985). The hepatic artery buffer response appears to be functional even after liver transplantation (Payen et al. 1990), and this response may be responsible for the development of the small-for-size syndrome after living donor or split liver transplantation (Kiuchi et al. 1999). Small-for-size syndrome develops in a patient who received a donor graft that was less than 1 % of the recipient\u2019s body weight and is caused by decreased hepatic arterial flow in response to increased portal venous flow and pressure. Subsequently, a prolonged postoperative reduction in hepatic arterial flow can lead to centrilobular tissue necrosis, biliary ischemia, and hepatic arterial thrombosis (Smyrniotis et al. 2002). There is no buffer response in the portal system because the portal vein cannot regulate its blood flow. Therefore, alterations in the hepatic arterial blood flow do not induce compensatory changes in the portal blood flow (Lautt 1983).",

Both afferent systems merge at the sinusoidal bed, where the pressure is estimated to be 2\u20134 mmHg higher than that in the IVC. The liver serves as a blood reservoir, and it replenishes blood volume of up to 25 % rapidly in the case of an acute bleeding episode (Lautt 2007).

Hepatocytes make up 60\u201380 % of liver cells and carry out hepatic metabolic, synthetic, and detoxification functions. Polyhedral hepatocytes are arranged in one-cell thick plates with endothelium-lined sinusoids on both sides. Each hepatocyte cell membrane has three distinct membrane domains. The sinusoidal membrane is adjacent to the sinusoidal endothelium and has numerous microvilli abutting into the space of Disse. Fenestrae within the sinusoidal endothelium without the basement membrane permit intimate contact between sinusoidal blood and the hepatocytes to allow the passage of big molecules, including lipoproteins. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells make up 15\u201320 % of liver cells and release nitric oxide to regulate vascular resistance. They are, along with dendritic cells and lymphocytes, part of the innate immune system. The space of Disse contains phagocytic Kupffer cells that participate in the hepatic inflammatory process. The Ito cells, also known as stellate cells, are the major site of vitamin A storage, and their activation results in hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Reticulin fibers in the space of Disse support the sinusoidal framework, and weakening of these supporting fibers results in rupture of sinusoidal walls and formation of blood-filled cysts known as peliosis hepatis, a forerunner of cirrhosis. The apical membrane circumscribes the canaliculus, the earliest component of the biliary system. The lateral hepatic membrane is found between adjacent hepatocytes.",

Each sinus contains three zones with equal blood pressure and oxygen content. The periportal zone (Zone 1) receives blood highest in oxygen content and the pericentral or perivenular zone (Zone 3) receives blood lowest in oxygen content. As a result, the hepatocytes in the perivenular zone (Zone 3) are more vulnerable to ischemic damage and nutrient depletion. Oxidative and reductive functions are predominantly performed by hepatocytes at the periportal zone and glucuronidation is performed by those at the perivenular zone, although hepatocytes of the two different zones are functionally integrated (Lamers et al. 1989). The unique structure of the liver acinus is well-suited for bidirectional transfer of nutrients. The low pressure in the portal venous system allows blood to flow slowly through the sinusoids. Hepatic arterial blood flows mainly to the terminal bile canaliculi, although it augments sinusoidal flow to give a gentle pulsatility. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the sinusoids acquire features of systemic capillaries: the space of Disse widens with collagen deposits at the basement membrane, endothelial fenestrations become smaller and fewer, and hepatic microvilli efface. All of these changes reduce transport across the sinusoidal walls and result in hepatic dysfunction. Furthermore, widespread fibrosis and scarring reduce the number and size of the small portal and hepatic veins and increase intrahepatic vascular resistance to the development of portal hypertension (Popper 1977). The sluggish blood flow in the altered vascular architecture promotes thrombosis, causing further cell necrosis and fibrosis (Wanless et al. 1995).\n",

For example, the newly transplanted hemiliver from a living related donor regenerates to about 85 % of its original whole liver size in 7\u201314 days. The major hepatic growth factors are epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor (Michalopoulos 1990). Administration of the epidermal or hepatocyte growth factor to normal rats, however, does not cause hepatocyte replication. This negative response suggests that liver regeneration involves a two-step process: the initial signal generated by an acute increase in metabolic demand associated with the loss of hepatocytes triggers a set of early response genes that prime hepatocytes to respond to various growth factors. In apoptosis or programmed cell death, aging hepatocytes are removed and new cells are produced in a continuous manner (Ellis et al. 1991).",

Caramelo et al. noted a 50 % decrease in cardiac output with volume expansion in a CCl4-induced cirrhotic rat model (Caramelo et al. 1986). In another rat model, the chronotropic response to isoproterenol was attenuated compared with that in control animals (Lee et al. 1990). Cardiac response to physical exercise is blunted in patients with cirrhosis, indicated by alterations in the pre-ejection period, isometric contraction time, and ratio of the pre-ejection period to left ventricular ejection time. In addition, abnormalities in myocardial diastolic indices suggest non-compliant ventricles. Histologically, myocardial fibrosis, mild subendocardial edema, and vacuolation of myocyte nucleus and cytoplasms are observed. The development of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is multifactorial. It appears that the \u03b2-receptor system, the main stimulant of the ventricle, is dysfunctional. In humans, lymphocyte \u03b2-receptor density, which reflects cardiac \u03b2-receptor status, is reduced in patients with severe ascites (Gerbes et al. 1986), and \u03b2-receptor density of the cardiomyocyte sarcolemmal plasma membrane is reduced in cirrhotic rats (Liu and Lee 1999). Further, the \u03b2-receptor signal transduction pathway is impaired at several levels (Ma et al. 1996). Although cardiac contractile impairment may result from overactivity of the muscarinic M2 receptor, the receptor density and binding affinity are unchanged, suggesting normal parasympathetic function (Jaue et al. 1997). High serum catecholamine levels, a result of desensitization and down-regulation of \u03b2-receptors, may lead to myocardial dysfunction in the presence of \u03b1-mediated coronary vasoconstriction. Additionally, overproduction of nitric oxide inhibits \u03b2-receptor-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) release, causing myocardial dysfunction and vasodilation (Hare and Colucci 1995).",

Other concomitant clinical signs are a markedly increased alveolar\u2013arterial oxygen gradient, portal hypertension, and vascular abnormality such as spider angioma and pulmonary vasodilation. The pulmonary vascular dilation (from 8\u201315 \u03bc to 15\u2013100 \u03bc) at the precapillary level is believed to be the main pathology of the hepatopulmonary syndrome, which is caused by decreasing erythrocyte transit time and impairing diffusion of oxygen to the erythrocytes at the center of the bloodstream (Genovesi et al. 1976). In contrast with other pulmonary diseases, oxygenation improves dramatically with a high inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2), because a high alveolar concentration of oxygen overcomes the diffusion barrier and oxygenates the erythrocytes in the center of the bloodstream.

The primary contributing factor for the hepatorenal syndrome is nitric oxide-induced vasodilation of the splanchnic vascular bed causing systemic arterial underfilling and relative hypovolemia (Arroyo et al. 1996). This relative hypovolemia activates baroreceptor-mediated sympathetic and the renin\u2013angiotensin system to constrict all vascular beds including the renal vasculature (Guevara et al. 1998). The initial prostaglandin-mediated compensatory renal vasodilation is followed by renal arterial vasoconstriction and renal hypoperfusion. A striking feature of the hepatorenal syndrome is the lack of any histologic change and its reversibility: the affected kidneys resume their function after successful liver transplantation. The renal failure may be rapid (Type 1) or insidious (Type 2) and results in sodium and water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. Since the hepatorenal syndrome is a functional renal failure, the urine is similar to that found in pre-renal azotemia: oliguria, low urinary sodium, and an increased urine osmolality and urine to plasma osmolality ratio.",

Other contributing factors are increased destruction of platelets by immune mechanisms, excessive activation of coagulation, and direct bone marrow suppression by toxins such as ethanol and folate deficiency.

A reduction in the fibrinogen level may indicate either a greatly reduced hepatic reserve or significant extravascular loss to ascites.

A suggested strategy for cardiac assessment is shown in Fig. 3 (Raval et al. 2011). Overall cardiac performance is evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography to assess myocardial contractility, abnormality in cardiac anatomy, intracardiac or intrapulmonary shunting, and pulmonary artery pressure. Most patients over age 50 years undergo non-invasive stress testing because they may have multiple CAD risk factors (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pre-existing cardiovascular disease), and limited physical activity masks underlying ischemic heart disease. An exercise stress test may not be feasible in many patients with advanced liver disease, and dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is commonly used, although adenosine or dipyridamole may be used when dobutamine-induced tachycardia is not desirable. DSE, with its high sensitivity and specificity, appears to be the most reliable screening test (Plotkin et al. 1998), and dobutamine-induced tachycardia may mimic intraoperative stress on the cardiovascular system. On the contrary, DSE has been reported to have poor sensitivity (as low as 13 %) and negative predictive value (as low as 75 %) (Harinstein et al. 2008), and its results may not correlate with adverse cardiac events within 30 days after transplantation (Safadi et al. 2009).\n",

Once the hepatic hilum is dissected, cannulas are inserted into the left superficial femoral vein (7 mm) and portal vein (9 mm) for outflow from the patient and into the left axillary vein (7 mm) for venous inflow. The cannula site and size may vary depending on the preference of the surgical team or anatomic variations. The cannulas and heparin-bonded tubings are flushed with heparin solution (2000 U/L) to avoid thrombosis during preparation. Systemic heparinization is not used because of the presence of pre-existing coagulopathy and the use of heparin-bonded tubings. The bypass run begins by unclamping all cannulas while the pump speed is gradually increased to achieve the maximal flow rate. Hepatectomy and anastomoses of the suprahepatic and infrahepatic IVC are performed once full bypass is achieved. The removal of the portal cannula for portal venous anastomosis leads to a partial bypass, which reduces venous return. Bypass is terminated after the engrafted liver is reperfused, and cannulas are removed.",

Non-invasive monitoring is similar to that for patients undergoing any major surgery. For invasive monitoring, two intra-arterial catheters (20 gauge in the left radial artery and 16\u201318 gauge in the right femoral artery) are used at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Femoral arterial pressure monitoring is preferred because it reflects central arterial blood pressure more accurately in the presence of low systemic vascular resistance, particularly after reperfusion (Lee et al. 2015). Radial arterial pressure monitoring is useful for blood sampling and backup pressure monitoring when the aorta is partially or completely clamped during aorta-to-hepatic artery anastomosis. A pulmonary artery catheter (PA catheter) is inserted via the right internal jugular vein to monitor cardiac output, intracardiac pressures, and core temperature. Carotid artery puncture should be assiduously avoided because of the presence of coagulopathy. An oximetric-type PA catheter provides additional information on mixed venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SvO2). The right ventricular ejection fraction-type PA catheter monitors the right ventricular ejection fraction and right ventricular end-diastolic volume. It has been shown that central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) are not as sensitive as right ventricular end-diastolic volume in estimating preload, particularly during the anhepatic stage (DeWolf et al. 1993b). Recently, non-invasive, continuous cardiac output monitoring was introduced; however, the technique is not reliable in monitoring cardiac output in hyperdynamic patients. In some centers, a CVP catheter is used instead of a PA catheter. This, of course, is justified if hemodynamic derangement is kept minimal during the entire surgical procedure. However, most centers use a PA catheter for three reasons: (1) hemodynamic instability can be unpredictable during liver transplantation; (2) determination of cardiac output and preload is more clinically significant than CVP monitoring; and (3) it is an important educational tool for trainees. TEE is used in all patients at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital to monitor myocardial contractility, ventricular end-diastolic volume, wall motion abnormality, air or thromboembolism, intrapulmonary shunting, and patency of the reconstructed major veins. A TEE probe may cause esophageal variceal bleeding (Burger-Klepp et al. 2012) and it should therefore be placed gently.",

The fibrinogen level is frequently maintained within the acceptable range, although severe hypofibrinogenemia may indicate either active fibrinolysis or excessive activation of coagulation.

Continuous administration of FFP is necessary to compensate for the loss of coagulation elements (procoagulants, prolysins, and their inhibitors) by surgical bleeding and excessive activation of coagulation. In patients with minimal blood loss, colloids (albumin or FFP) and crystalloids may be required to compensate for the third-space fluid loss and continuous production of ascites.

Additionally, the pulmonary vascular response to various vasodilators (i.e., diltiazem, nitroglycerin, epoprostenol, and nitric oxide) may be evaluated. Liver transplantation may continue when pulmonary hypertension is mild to moderate with normal right ventricular function. In such cases, right ventricular function is supported by maintaining optimal preload and improving myocardial contractility by inotropes.",

In the simple cross-clamping technique, clamping of the IVC and portal vein reduces venous return by up to 40 %, leading to low cardiac output, hypotension, and compensatory tachycardia (Pappas et al. 1971). Calculated systemic vascular resistance is frequently elevated, although this is a reflection of the exclusion of the vascular tree of the lower extremities and splanchnic bed. It is noteworthy that cross-clamping of the IVC and the portal vein decreases the central blood volume and pressure (CVP and PCWP) but progressively increases total intravascular blood volume as blood is sequestered in the vascular bed of the gastrointestinal and pelvic organs, kidneys, and lower extremities. A prolonged low output state, portal hypertension, and renal venous congestion may lead to acidosis, intestinal swelling, and hematuria. We, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, prefer to treat the low output state by administration of fluid and/or inotropes (dopamine or dobutamine 2\u20135 \u03bcg/kg/min).",

            "text": "Venovenous bypass is more physiologic technique than a simple cross-clamping technique as it returns venous blood from the portal and IVC system (Shaw et al. 1984). Hence, hemodynamic changes that occur during the anhepatic stage with venovenous bypass are minimal when the bypass flow rate is greater than 25 % of the baseline cardiac output and, therefore, the bypass flow should be monitored and adjusted as needed. Improper positioning of the cannula tip in the femoral or portal vein, or a kinked bypass circuit, may not drain blood adequately and the surgical team should correct their positions. A low pump speed reduces venous return, while a high pump speed collapses the outflow venous wall and decreases the bypass flow. The perfusionist, therefore, should adjust the pump speed to maximize the bypass flow. In addition, hypovolemia decreases the bypass flow, and it should be corrected by the anesthesia team. The anesthesia and surgical teams should be prepared for potential acute complications of venovenous bypass. Bleeding or air entry may result from venous laceration during cannulation or improperly secured cannulas. Entry of a small volume of air (up to 50 mL) into the bypass pump may not cause immediate systemic air embolism because it is trapped in the cone-shaped pump head by centripetal force. Thromboembolism may be caused by the migration of pre-existing thrombi or those developed during a low bypass flow rate (<1000 mL/min), particularly in hypercoagulable conditions (i.e., Budd-Chiari syndrome, neoplasms, and congenital protein C deficiency). Most importantly, the bypass may have to be terminated unexpectedly when serious complications occur. Therefore, the anesthesia team should be prepared for unexpected cross-clamping of the IVC and portal vein at all times. After completion of the IVC anastomosis, the portal cannula is removed to facilitate the portal venous anastomosis, resulting in partial bypass. Low bypass flow and low cardiac output during this period can be improved by the administration of fluids or dopamine, but full correction of central hypovolemia, as reflected on CVP, PCWP, or TEE, is avoided to prevent fluid overload on reperfusion.",

Hepatectomy in the presence of portal hypertension can be difficult, and hypovolemia is not uncommon as a consequence of inadvertent compression of the IVC and portal vein, partial side-clamping of the IVC, and cross-clamping of the portal vein during portal anastomosis. Hence, temporary portacaval shunt or portal-axillary venovenous bypass may be instituted in surgically challenging patients to maintain preload.",

Unclamping of the infrahepatic IVC and portal vein results in transient hypovolemia and hypotension due to acute sequestration of the blood in the engrafted liver. Unclamping of the suprahepatic IVC increases preload by mobilizing blood from the low extremities and splanchnic circulation. This is followed by severe hemodynamic changes, the so-called postreperfusion syndrome (Aggarwal et al. 1993). The postreperfusion syndrome, which occurs in approximately 30 % of patients, is defined by abrupt hypotension (below 70 % of the baseline value) that develops within 5 min of reperfusion and lasts for more than 1 min. Other associated hemodynamic changes are bradycardia, high CVP and PCWP, low systemic vascular resistance, and conduction defects. Acute reduction in myocardial contractility is observed in TEE. The postreperfusion syndrome appears to be caused by a combination of several factors. For example, an acute increase in preload may result in right ventricular strain and an acute decrease in blood temperature (2\u20133 \u00b0C) by the systemic entry of the cold preservation solution may decrease cardiac conduction and contractility. Other physical factors are air embolism and thromboembolism, which may cause right ventricular strain or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (Ellis et al. 1989; Suriani et al. 1996). Chemical factors involved are acute hyperkalemia and acidosis. Systemic entry of hyperkalemic preservation solution increases serum potassium level to a very high level (up to 12 mmol/L), causing severe bradycardia and conduction defects (Martin 1986). Return of the acidic blood from the viscera and lower extremities increases the base deficit by 5\u201310 mmol/L. In addition, unknown endogenous vasodilators or myocardial depressants (i.e., vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, nitric oxide, and eicosanoid) released from the allograft or congested viscera may decrease systemic vascular resistance and impair myocardial function.\n",

Fibrinolysis may develop, particularly in patients with hepatocellular disease, as a result of a low level of inhibitors of fibrinolysis and impaired hepatic clearance of tPA (Lewis et al. 1989a). Excessive activation of coagulation, evidenced by a gradual increase in thrombin\u2013antithrombin complex, develops at the end of the dissection stage (Kratzer et al. 1991). Management of coagulation begins with normalization of physiologic variables, such as ionic hypocalcemia, hypothermia, and acidosis impair coagulation (Rohrer and Natale 1992). This is followed by continuous infusion of coagulation factor-rich blood (RBC:FFP:PlasmaLyte-A\u00ae or normal saline = 1 unit:1 unit:250 mL) to maintain coagulation factor levels above the critical level (30\u201350 % of normal). Specific blood components may be administered based on TEG/ROTEM. In general, platelets (5\u201310 units) are administered for a small maximum amplitude (MA) (<40 mm). Platelet administration, in addition to increasing MA, improves reaction time (r) and clot formation rate (\u03b1), because the coagulation cascade leading to fibrin formation occurs on the surface of platelets. Its administration, however, is withheld during the anhepatic stage to avoid potential thrombosis and during massive blood transfusion (>150 mL/min) to minimize wastage. Two units of FFP may be administered when the reaction time is prolonged (r> 12 min) even after platelet administration Cryoprecipitate (6 units) containing factors I and VIII are rarely required unless severe fibrinolysis is left untreated because plasmin selectively destroys factors I, V, and VIII. However, cryoprecipitate may be used for patients with severe hypofibrinogenemia (<100 mg/dL).\n",

            "text": "The postreperfusion syndrome occurs in coagulation at the onset of the neohepatic stage. A typical coagulation profile shows prolonged PT, aPTT, reptilase time, and thrombin time. A generalized decrease in coagulation factors (I, V, VII, and VIII) and platelets is accompanied by a sharp increase in the tPA level, a shortened euglobulin lysis time, and a moderate increase in fibrin(ogen) degradation products and thrombin\u2013antithrombin complex. Fibrinolysis is observed in up to 80 % of patients and is severe in about 40 % (Kang et al. 1987). Fibrinolysis is caused by a 20-fold increase in tPA being released from the allograft and congested viscera, which overwhelms the activity of the plasminogen activator inhibitor (Virji et al. 1989; Porte et al. 1989). There are ample data to support the finding that fibrinolysis is primary in origin: a relatively steady antithrombin level, only moderate levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products and d-dimers, selective decreases in factors I, V, and VIII, and no known microthrombi formation (Lewis et al. 1989a, b). Fibrinolysis resolves over the 120 min following reperfusion. The heparin effect occurs in approximately 30 % of patients, as heparin is released from the allograft and dissipates over the next 60\u201390 min.",

When fibrinolysis is present, early treatment using a single, small dose of EACA (250\u2013500 mg) is recommended in order to reduce delayed oozing and to minimize the loss of factors I, V, and VIII (Kang et al. 1997). Prophylactic administration of EACA or tranexamic acid (AMCA) is a common practice in many centers, but has not shown scientific efficacy. Fibrinolysis prophylaxis is not recommended by the authors, because the presence of fibrinolysis can easily be detected by TEG/ROTEM and can be treated effectively with a small dose of EACA in most patients. When the heparin effect is present, a small dose of protamine sulfate (25\u201350 mg) may be given in severe cases. In addition, blood coagulability can be impaired by reperfusion hypothermia, acidosis, and ionic hypocalcemia.",

Aprotinin (2,000,000 KIU followed by 500,000 KIU/h), a non-specific inhibitor of plasminogen and serine protease, may reduce blood loss by inhibiting fibrinolysis and excessive activation of coagulation (Neuhaus et al. 1989; Cottam et al. 1991). However, clinical use of aprotinin declined even before the drug was withdrawn by the manufacturer: clinical reports did not show a significant reduction in blood loss (Ickx et al. 1993; Groh et al. 1993), and fibrinolysis can be treated with EACA or AMCA more efficiently with negligible side effects (Kang et al. 1987; Boylan et al. 1996). Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been suggested to improve coagulation and reduces bleeding by actively enhancing coagulation and stimulating fibrin formation in the presence of tissue factor. Its beneficial effects have been shown in patients with fulminant hepatic failure, \u201ccritical bleeding,\u201d and a ruptured liver (Meadows et al. 2011; Merchant et al. 2004; Yamaguchi et al. 2015). However, results of clinical trials are controversial (Planinsic et al. 2005; Gasperi and Baudo 2006; Niemann et al. 2006) and a European consensus concluded that a paucity of data from clinical trials with rFVIIa limits both the strength and the scope of clinical recommendations (Vincent et al. 2006). Recently, the use of prothrombin complex concentrate has been assessed in a limited number of centers. Prothrombin complex concentrate is prepared from FFP and contains clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, protein C, and protein S, and its use may improve coagulation without increasing preload (Arshad et al. 2013). However, it has limited components of coagulation and its clinical advantage requires further investigation. Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), a synthetic analog of 8-arginine vasopressin, increases the endothelial release of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen. Its beneficial effects have been demonstrated in vitro and in patients with liver disease, and it may be used to improve coagulation (0.3 \u03bcg/kg) (Kang et al. 1993). Conjugated estrogen has been reported to improve coagulation and reduce blood loss (Frenette et al. 1998), although its use has not been accepted widely.\n",

Ionic hypocalcemia begins to appear during the dissection stage (Marquez et al. 1986) and becomes severe during the anhepatic stage. The serum-ionized calcium level is inversely related to the serum citrate level, as the absence of hepatic metabolism of citrate increases the serum citrate level close to that in the banked blood (Fig. 8). Significant hypocalcemia (Ca2+ <0.55 mmol/L) is associated with a prolonged Q\u2013T interval and decreases in the cardiac index, stroke\u2013work index, and blood pressure. Therefore, the ionized calcium concentration is monitored hourly or more frequently, and CaC12 (15 mg/kg) or calcium gluconate (30 mg/kg) is administered to maintain a normal level (Martin et al. 1990). Ionic hypocalcemia improves gradually as the engrafted liver begins to metabolize citrate, unless the speed of the transfusion exceeds the metabolic function of the liver.\n",

Severe hypokalemia (<2.5 mmol/L) is treated with potassium chloride to increase its level to 3.0\u20134.0 mmol/L. Moderate hypokalemia (<3.5 mmol/L) is not treated because it is well-tolerated by patients and self-corrected by blood transfusion. Hyperkalemia is a serious concern because it interferes with myocardial conduction and contractility, particularly in the presence of acidosis and hypocalcemia. Progressive hyperkalemia (up to 6\u20137 mmol/L) may occur in patients with renal dysfunction or those requiring massive blood transfusion. Mild hyperkalemia (up to 5.5 mmol/L) is treated with insulin (10 units) and glucose (12.5 g). It has been shown that glucose and insulin therapy is effective in lowering the serum potassium level even in the absence of hepatic function (Dewolf et al. 1993a). For moderate-to-severe hyperkalemia (>5.5 mmol/L), in addition to insulin therapy, PRBC or phlebotomized blood can be washed to remove potassium using an autotransfusion system before transfusion (Ellis et al. 1987).",

A rapid rise in the serum sodium level (>10 mmol/L) is a clinical concern because it may contribute to the development of central pontine myelinolysis, a serious neurological injury caused by the destruction of the myelin sheath in the pons (Videira et al. 1991). Therefore, the preoperative serum sodium level should be raised to >130 mmol/L, if possible, and a rapid increase in sodium should be prevented by administration of low sodium-containing crystalloids during surgery. In addition, tromethamine (THAM) is the preferred drug for treatment of metabolic acidosis as it does not contain sodium. Hypernatremia may be seen in some patients who receive a large dose of NaHCO3 preoperatively. This hypernatremia is gradually normalized by administration of blood products and a balanced electrolyte solution.",

This goal is frequently achieved by ventilating with a tidal volume of 10\u201315 mL/kg, FiO2 of 30\u201340 %, respiratory rate of <20/min, and a low level of PEEP (<5 cmH2O). However, in donors with pulmonary complications, adjustments are made in tidal volume (up to 20 mL/kg), respiratory rate (up to 20/min), and PEEP (up to 10 cmH2O).",

            "text": "Aggressive circulatory care is essential because hemodynamic instability may impair organ perfusion. Specifically, hypotension (systolic blood pressure <80 mmHg or mean arterial pressure <40 mmHg) is associated with a high incidence of acute tubular necrosis, non-function of the graft kidneys, and poor hepatic function. It is generally agreed that systolic blood pressure should be within the normal range (100\u2013120 mmHg) and CVP should be <10 cmH2O with minimal vasopressor support. Maintaining circulatory homeostasis, however, can be challenging. Preload is frequently decreased because of blood loss, vasomotor paralysis, diuretic therapy, and diabetes inspidus, although fluid resuscitation may result in overload. The heart rate may vary depending on the degree of brain injury, ranging from tachycardia to bradycardia. Arrhythmia is not uncommon, and myocardial contractility is frequently impaired by myocytolysis, myocardial necrosis, coronary spasm, and reduction of myocardial energy storage (Novitzky et al. 1988). Afterload may be high, from excessive sympathetic tone, or low, from vasomotor paralysis. Volume deficit is usually corrected with lactated Ringer\u2019s or colloid solution, and transfusion of PRBCs (1\u20133 units) may be necessary to maintain hematocrit between 25 and 35 % (Hardesty and Griffith 1986). Once the fluid deficit is corrected, a glucose-containing hypotonic solution (5 % dextrose in 0.45 % NaCl 1 mL/kg/h) is administered to replace urine output and insensible loss, guided by CVP and urine output. Excessive urine output (>200\u2013250 mL/h) is replaced using a hypotonic electrolyte solution with supplementation of KCl (20 mEq/L). Tachycardia with hypertension should be avoided as it may cause pulmonary edema, decrease organ perfusion, and increase myocardial oxygen consumption. A \u03b2-antagonist (i.e., labetalol hydrochloride or esmolol hydrochloride) or a calcium channel blocker (verapamil hydrochloride) is used to treat tachycardia and arrhythmia (Novitzky et al. 1984). For bradycardia, isoproterenol or epinephrine is used for positive chronotropic effects because donors are unresponsive to centrally acting chronotropic drugs (i.e., atropine). Supraventricular or ventricular arrythmia is treated using antiarrhythmic drugs. Low afterload is compensated for by increasing preload because \u03b1-vasopressors increase the myocardial work load and decrease splanchnic and coronary blood flow. In severely hypertensive donors, an \u03b1-blocker (hydralazine or sodium nitroprusside) may be given to reduce the afterload. When cardiac output and organ perfusion are impaired, inotropes (dopamine hydrochloride, dobutamine hydrochloride, and isoproterenol hydrochloride) are recommended to improve cardiac contractility. In brain-dead animal models, serum levels of triiodothyronine, insulin, and cortisol have been found to be low, and the administration of triiodothyronine may improve hemodynamic stability by maintaining myocardial high-energy stores and glycogen (James et al. 2010). Circulatory arrest, which occurs in 10 % of potential donors (Emery et al. 1986), is managed in the standard fashion, except atropine is not effective.",

Commonly seen electrolyte imbalances are hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, and they are treated in a standard fashion.
