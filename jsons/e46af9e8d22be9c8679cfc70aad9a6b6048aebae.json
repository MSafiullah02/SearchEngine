After the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS in China, another epidemiologically relevant coronavirus infection rose in Middle East countries represented by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); finally, by the end of 2019, an increase in pneumonias of unknow origin was revealed in Wuhan, a city in the province of Hubei in China, which were later revealed to be etiologically related by a novel coronavirus, say 2019-nCoV.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are members of the Nidovirales order according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (de Groot, et al., 2018) belonging to the Cornidovirineae suborder, being themselves a family of viruses, the Coronaviridae in which we may encounter two subfamilies: Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae; it is within the latter subfamily of viruses that we find the genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus. SARS-2003-related coronavirus is found in the subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronaviruses; while MERS-CoV is found in the subgenus Merbecovirus of Betacoronaviruses. An alternative classification was proposed in which coronaviruses are grouped in tetramers: Group 1 (TGEV, FCoV, CECoV, PEDV, HCoV-229E), Group 2 (HEV, BCoV, CRCoV, MHV, RtCoV, PuCoV, HCoV-OC43), Group 3 (IBV, TCoV, PhCoV) and Group 4 (SARS-CoV) (Cavanagh, 2005) . Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses and display the largest genome sizes amongst all RNA viruses (from 26.2 to 31.7 kb (McBride, van Zyl, & Fielding, 2014) . The virions have diameters that range from 80 to 120 nm, however smallest as 50 nm and largest as 200 nm diameters have been noted. From the envelope some proteins project from 15 to 20 nm, these are spike (S) proteins and all coronaviruses have genes to code these proteins (S gene) which internalize in the virion and are mechanically bound by means of a \"foot\" like extension of 10 nm long. Along with these spike proteins, there exist shorter proteins which protrude the virion surface from 5 to 10 nm, these being the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins (Masters, 2006) . The nucleocapsid protein (CoVN) shows conserved regions: N terminal domain (NTD), C-terminal domain (CTD) and an intrinsically disordered central region (RNAbinding domain); however the name of the domains, all three of them have been shown to interact with viral RNA. The NTD has shown a grade of divergence amongst coronaviruses both in amino acid content and length, this domain associated with the 3' end of the viral RNA genome by means of Gaussian electrostatic interactions; the NTD shows convergence in some structural aspects: secondary structures, such as the beta sheet flanked by alpha helices, a basic RNA binding groove, enrichment in aromatic and basic residues. The NTD resembles \"hand\"-like structure: an acidic wrist, a hydrophobic palm and basic fingers. The CTD domain is hydrophobic and promotes homodimerization of the nucleoprotein (sometimes, not only homodimerization but also oligomerization). This protein promotes the formation of the viral capsid protecting the virus from degradation by extracellular agents; the self-association of the N protein has been seen as a target in coronavirus infection treatment (McBride, van Zyl, & Fielding, 2014) . Within the coronavirus genome we may find the polyproteins, which show replicase activity; this protein uses the genome as the template for the synthesis producing mRNAs, these are then translated into structural proteins and others; the structural proteins transit then hatch to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transiting then towards the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) . The nucleocapsids are formed when the progeny genomes interact with the N protein; these newly formed nucleocapsids bud into the ERGIC, forming then virions ready to exit the cell (Masters, 2006) . Coronaviruses' spike proteins have been shown to interact with cellular receptors for their internalization into the cell, such as the human aminopeptidase N protein (ANPEP, membrane alanyl aminopeptidase) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Masters, 2006) .",

            "text": "This protein contains three segments: a large ectodomain (which consists of a subunit S1 with receptor-binding activity and an S2 subunit with membrane-fusion activity), a transmembrane anchor and an intracellular tail. Trimerization of the protein is in order when seen at the microscope having S1 subunits in one extracellular extreme and S2 subunits in the other extreme. Various domains of the spike protein bind to different proteins/receptors in the host: S1-N-terminal domain binds to sugars (in Alphacoronavirus), to CEACAM1 (in MHV Betacoronavirus), and sugars in BCoV and IBV (a Gammacoronavirus). Whereas the S1-C-terminal domain binds to ACE2 (in Alphacoronaviruses and SARS-CoV), aminopeptidase N (TGEV-PEDV, PRCV), and DPP4 (in MERS-CoV). The S1 subunits display divergence in their sequences across genera, however convergence is seen in those of the same genus. The S1 C-terminal domain subunit contains itself two subdomains (as it has been seen in that S protein corresponding to SARS-CoV) these subdomains are: a core structure and a receptorbinding motif, this latter subdomain binds to ACE2 by means of a concave outer surface, this concavity is formed by a beta-sheet with two ridges (loops). Two virus-binding residues in ACE2 have been shown to highly contribute to the binding of the virus by promoting a regional hydrophobic environment: Lys31 and Lys353; this specificity can tell us about how a couple of mutations in both ACE2 or the S1 subunit in the spike protein may promote either resistance (or increased susceptibility) or species tropism in regards to the infection. This S1-C-terminal subunit in MERS-CoV binds to DPP4, this subunit contains as well, in itself, two subdomains: a core structure and a receptor binding motif, however this motif is not concave but flat, and DPP4 forms a homodimer, each monomer with a hydrolase domain and a beta-propeller domain (Li, 2016) , said structure (beta propellers) have been seen in various species, and several classes are known, depending on the symmetry axis, for instance, the neuraminidase protein of the influenza virus has six four-stranded beta sheets; this beta propeller structure is a highly symmetrical structure with four to eight-fold repeats of a four-stranded antiparallel betasheet motif, this beta sheets are arranged around a central tunnel, and a hydrophobic character of the interactions provides the stability (Pons, G\u00f3mez, Chinea, & Valencia, 2003) , in the case of DPP4, the viral binding motifs are seen in the other surface of the beta propeller domain (Li, 2016) . It has been noted that the COVID19 S2 subunit displays a high degree of conservation, contrary to the S1 subunit with 40% of identity with other SARS-CoVs (Cascella, Rajnik, Dulebohn, & Di Napoli, 2020) . The spike protein has been considered a member of the class I viral membrane fusion proteins, including those from: influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus and Ebola virus; in which we may see: hemagglutinin glycoprotein corresponding to the influenza virus, Env protein in HIV (trimer of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers (Wilen, Tilton, & Doms, 2012) ), and GP (glycoprotein) in Ebola virus (which is a triplet of heterodimers, composed of a receptor binding subunit GP1, and a fusion subunit GP2) (Salata, et al., 2019) . Analogies can be made from the fusion process corresponding to influenza virus and hemagglutinin, for which there exist both a prefusion and a postfusion state, in the latter one there exists a dramatic conformational change, fusion peptides are exposed and insert into the target membrane, there is an energy barrier for such a conformational change which may be overcome by means of receptor binding (as seen in HIV fusion), low pH (influenza virus) or both (avian leucosis virus); this energy barrier in coronavirus is thought to be worked out by means of proteolysis of the spike proteins: proprotein convertases, during virus packaging, extracellular proteases, cell surface proteases, lysosomal proteases; low pH and receptor binding (as seen in other class I fusion proteins) may as well promote the reaction and overcome the energy barrier (Li, 2016) .",

This enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin I into angiotensin (1-9) and angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7); it is as well a receptor for the novel COVID19-virus. The gene encoding for this protein is found in Xp22.2 and has 21 exons. This protein is expressed in the following tissues: colon, duodenum, fat, gall bladder, heart, kidney, liver, testis, thyroid and lung amongst others (NIH, 2020), the tissue expression of ACE2 is augmented in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and those who are under treatment with thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen (Fang, Karakiulakis, & Roth, 2020 ) however those who have not yet received treatment show lower expression levels, this mechanism is thought to be mediated by angiotensin II via ERK/p38 MAP or ERK1/2 and JNK, furthermore, should we block AT1R, ACE2 levels rise, this rise can also be obtained by administering low doses of aldosterone, and decreases are seen when treated with endothelin 1 (Clarke & Turner, 2011) ; as well interethnic differences in expression patterns have been noted which may predispose to different susceptibilities (Cao, et al., 2020) . One of the catalysed products of ACE2 is angiotensin (1-7) which serves to activate MAS1 proto-oncogene, which is a G protein-coupled receptor, its actions include: vasodilation, vascular protection, anti-fibrotic, anti-proliferative and reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines (Clarke & Turner, 2011) . Thus, we may consider ACE2 production pathways-blockage in order to diminish the probability of COVID19-virus to be received and internalized by the cell, by means of JNK (MAPK8), MAPK14 (p38), endothelin-1, AT1R agonists or aldosterone receptors antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone). ACE2 has been shown to interact itself with two small molecules: moexipril and lisinopril, which may induce conformational changes in ACE2 necessary to diminish the hydrophobicity of the region responsible of the interaction with the spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses (TyersLab, 2020), other chemicals have been noted: 2-amino-N,N-diethyl-1,3-benzothiazole-6carboxamide (also displaying anti-HIV reverse transcriptase activity and antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis) (PubChem, 2020), losartan, D-glucose, streptozotocin, captopril, diminazene aceturate (PubChem, 2020).",

It shows two isoforms, the longer is antiapoptotic and the shorter is a proapoptotic (NIH, 2020), and it has been seen that BCLXL interacts with the envelope E protein of coronaviruses, enabling then the apoptosis of T cells, compatible with the clinical features of lymphopoenia seen in coronaviruses infections (Yang, et al., 2005) .",

However it has been seen that the E protein from SARS viruses induce NLRP3 inflammasome response (Chen, Moriyama, Chang, & Ichinohe, 2019) perhaps by means of the interaction there is sustained with BCLXL and pore formation in mitochondria, which may induce a potassium efflux (reducing the amounts of intracellular potassium) leading to NLRP3 activation, this aided by means of NEK7 which has been shown as a driving factor in cellular division, where NEK7 increased levels diminish mitotic rate and inflammasome activation and caspase 1 activation, also leading then to IL1B and IL18 concentration increases (Broz & Dixit, 2016) , the NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been related not only to recruitment of caspase 1 but also of caspase 4 and 5 (PubChem, 2020), moreover, NLRP3 is an upstream activator of NFKB (NIH, 2020); because of these various interactions that NLRP3 shows and the possible clinical signs and symptoms we may encounter due to this activation, it could be advisable in certain cases to induce NLRP3 inactivation in order to diminish respiratory distress by means of small molecules . In regards to IL1B signalling, it has been seen that it interacts with its receptor IL1R, activating IRAK4 (interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase), activating TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6) and some other downstream proteins (TAB2, TAK1, MKK3, p38), finally promoting the activation of IL6, IL8, as well as COX2, NFKB (Weber, Wasiliew, & Kracht, 2010) ; thus we may see as well that the restrictions in oxygenation seen in SARS may be very well induced by means of an overt inflammation by COVID19-virus. In turn, the unfolded protein response pathway that is seen activated by means of the envelope protein promotes the activation of NFKB and MAPK8, XBP1u (unspliced X box-binding protein 1) which promotes UPR target genes transcription, EIF2A (this factor inhibits translation and activates ATF4, augmenting UPR target genes transcription), AT6F (also promotes UPR target genes); the phenotype of the UPR target genes transcription is: autophagy, apoptosis, co-translational degradation, protein secretion, lipid synthesis (Hetz, 2012) .",
