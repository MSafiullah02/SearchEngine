A complete history and thorough physical examination are of utmost importance in the characterization of gastrointestinal disease in small ruminants, with attention made during the physical examination to body condition score (BCS), abdominal contour, manure characteristics, and motility of the reticulorumen. Combined use of auscultation, percussion, and ballottement over the entire abdomen should be carried out, especially given preclusion of rectal palpation in sheep, goats, and most cervids. Even with a complete physical examination, localizing the exact nature of GIT disease can be difficult. The physical examination can be augmented using ancillary tests, including the assessment of clinicopathological parameters including rumen fluid evaluation, as well as the use of imaging modalities. If indicated, an exploratory laparotomy can serve both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "JENNA E. BAYNE AND MISTY A.

These tests, along with diagnostic imaging, help define the differential list generated from the physical examination. Furthermore, they can be helpful in determining the severity of disease, prognosis, and response to therapy with serial evaluation. Rarely, a specific disease is identified based on clinicopathological tests. Usefulness of the CBC includes the evaluation of the erythrogram and leukogram to characterize the severity of anemia, dehydration, and inflammatory response. Interpretation of the packed cell volume (PCV) should be done in conjunction with total protein concentration as well as the estimation of dehydration on physical examination. An anemic or dehydrated hypoproteinemic animal may have a normal PCV and total protein. Both the CBC and serum biochemistry can be helpful in determining the presence and severity of an inflammatory disease process. Changes in the total and differential white blood cell counts indicate acute or chronic inflammation, ranging from neutropenia and a degenerative left shift to a mature neutrophilia. Increases in globulins or fibrinogen suggest a chronic inflammatory disease. Low protein levels, especially albumin, need to be further evaluated for the potential of chronic blood loss due to gastrointestinal parasitism, infiltrative bowel disease, liver dysfunction, thirdspace compartmentalization, or protein loss through the kidneys.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diagnostic Procedures Basic Laboratory Studies"}, {"text": "Liver disease should be suspected if liver enzymes or bilirubin levels are increased. However, liver enzyme concentrations can be normal in the presence of chronic liver disease. Also, albumin levels rarely drop in ruminants with liver disease as they do in other species. Liver function tests may be performed, including measurement of bile acids and blood ammonia concentrations. Point-of-care (POC) meters for the stall-side measurement of blood glucose, L-lactate, and ketone concentrations have been evaluated in cattle and small ruminants. [1] [2] [3] [4] Urine strips for the detection of ketone bodies are also useful in monitoring ewes and does at risk for pregnancy toxemia. Changes in electrolytes are common with gastrointestinal diseases, especially in anorexic animals or those with profound diarrhea. Electrolyte measurements are also useful in the formulation of treatment plans. Although abomasal disease is rare in small ruminants, a metabolic alkalosis with hypochloremia and hypokalemia may be observed. Gastrointestinal stasis can result in hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and a mild hypocalcemia. In the case of surgical intestinal obstructions, small ruminants can develop severe metabolic acidosis due to ischemic necrosis of tissues and shock. The major biochemical changes commonly associated with diarrhea are metabolic acidosis, with the loss of sodium and bicarbonate in diarrheic feces, and the presence of azotemia and hypoproteinemia.

Collection of rumen fluid can be via orogastric or nasogastric intubation or percutaneous rumenocentesis. Regardless of method chosen, proper restraint of the animal and suitable equipment ( Figure 5 .1) should be used to avoid trauma to the esophagus or abdominal viscera and damage of equipment (e.g., chewed tubes). To perform percutaneous rumenocentesis, a 16-to 18-gauge, 3-inch (7.6-cm) needle is inserted into the rumen fluid below the fiber mat. The site for rumenocentesis can be estimated by ballottement or percussion of the left flank (approximately 5-10 cm caudal to the last rib along an imaginary line drawn at the level of the patella) 5 or, alternatively, at a ventral location caudal to the xiphoid and to the left of midline. 6 Use of sedation and/or a local block with 2% lidocaine may be necessary in fractious or patients likely to struggle. The site is clipped and aseptically prepared. The needle is introduced forcefully, in one swift motion. Once the rumen is entered, fluid is aspirated with a syringe. If the needle becomes obstructed with ingesta, a small amount of air or fluid should be forced backed through the needle. Rumenocentesis carries the advantage of avoiding salivary contamination of the sample, which can occur during orogastric intubation, as well as possibly being less stressful to the animal. The procedure does carry a slight risk of peritonitis, which is minimized through proper restraint. Rumenocentesis is contraindicated in pregnant females. 5, 6 Once collected, rumen fluid is analyzed for color, odor, pH, motility and types of protozoal species present, methylene blue reduction (MBR) time, Gram-staining characteristics, and chloride concentration. Normal rumen fluid characteristics are listed in Table 5 .1. The pH of rumen fluid can be measured on pH strips with 0.5 increments or the use of sophisticated handheld meters. The sample pH will be falsely increased with salivary contamination. 7 Microscopic examination of a drop of fresh, warm fluid under a cover slip examined at 403 to 1003 allows visualization of protozoa species, with no special staining required ( Figure 5 .2). Routine Gram staining is performed on a dried, fixed slide. 5 The MBR reflects the activity of bacterial fermentation in the rumen. It is performed by mixing 1 mL of 0.03% methylene blue with 20 mL of rumen fluid at normal body temperature and measuring the time required to return to the appearance of a control tube. 5 Rumen chloride concentrations can be determined from the supernatant of a centrifuged sample. Rumen chloride concentrations are minimally impacted by saliva contamination and a time lag between sample collection and analysis. 5 Normal rumen fluid is aromatic, olive to brownish-green, and has a pH between 6.5 to 7.5 depending on the diet fed. Microorganisms include a mixed population of large and small protozoal species with active motility and a predominance of gram-negative rods. Normal rumen chloride concentration is less than 30 mEq/L and MBR should be less than 6 minutes. 6 Changes observed in anorexic ruminants include thinner, darker fluid, with an increase in pH (7-7.5) , and a reduction in the species and motility of protozoa present. In acute ruminal acidosis, the fluid is fetid, yellow to grey, with a low pH (, 5.2), and dead or no protozoa are present with a predominance of gram-positive rods (Lactobacillus species). 5, 8 The MBR is prolonged with any type of indigestion/digestive disorder in which inactivity of the microflora is present. Increased rumen chloride concentrates indicate an abomasal or proximal small intestinal obstruction, either functional or mechanical, as a result of the internal reflux of hydrochloric acid from the abomasum into the reticulorumen. 9", "cite_spans": [{"start": 950, "end": 951, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1701, "end": 1703, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1705, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2158, "end": 2159, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2410, "end": 2411, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2669, "end": 2670, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2897, "end": 2898, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3254, "end": 3255, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3349, "end": 3356, "text": "(7-7.5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3613, "end": 3615, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3616, "end": 3617, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 396, "end": 404, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1968, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2344, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Rumen Fluid Analysis"}, {"text": "Abdominocentesis is useful in the assessment of abdominal disease in ruminants and aids in the differentiation and diagnosis of ascites, peritonitis, strangulating intestinal lesions, enteritis, uroperitoneum, and abdominal neoplasia. There is normally a small amount of transudative fluid present in the peritoneal space. Characterization of peritoneal fluid as a transudate (low protein concentration and cell count), modified transudate (normal or mild increase in cell count with increased protein concentration), or exudate (increased protein concentration and cell count) is important from a pathophysiological standpoint and allows refinement of possible differentials for the abdominal disease present. Characteristics of peritoneal fluid from healthy sheep and goats are similar to cattle: transparent, colorless to slightly yellow, , 5 g/dL protein, and less than 5000 to 10,000 cells/mL. 10, 11 Peritoneal fluid protein concentration can be measured using a refractometer. Other biochemical analyses may include determination of creatinine (e.g., to diagnose uroperitoneum), L-lactate, D-dimer, and glucose concentrations. 12, 13 Cytologic examination is needed to characterize the types of cells present, the morphology of those cells, and to assess the presence of phagocytized bacteria. Typically, the cell population is made up of large mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, and non-degenerative neutrophils. Lymphocytes comprise , 20% of cells present, and a few mast cells or plasma cells may be seen. 10 Both the absolute number and proportion of cell types present need to be considered. Changes in peritoneal fluid cytology following exploratory laparotomy, rumenotomy, and enterotomy are reported in goats. [14] [15] [16] Two methods can be used. The first technique involves tapping the cranial abdomen at its lowest point cranial to the umbilicus and slightly to the right of midline ( Figure 5 . 3 ). This technique is useful in conditions with a significant amount of free fluid such as uroperitoneum. When using the cranial abdominal site, one needs to avoid the prepuce in males and the mammary veins in females. 6 The second technique is a four-quadrant approach, as ruminants are very proficient at walling off inflammatory and infectious foci (e.g., peritonitis), which can hinder successful fluid collection. The two cranial sites are slightly caudal to the xiphoid and medial to the milk veins on both sides. The two caudal sites are slightly cranial to the mammary gland and to the left and right of midline. 5 For either technique, manual restraint with sedation is recommended; the use of real-time ultrasonography may help locate fluid pockets.

Ultrasonography also can be used to guide fluid and tissue sampling for abdominocentesis and biopsy of organs or masses, respectively. 20 Normal parameters for the forestomach compartments, small and large intestines, liver, and spleen have been described in small ruminants. 21, 22 Imaging is best achieved using a linear or convex transducer with a frequency of 3.5 to 5.0 MHz. The reticulum is imaged in the cranioventral abdomen, bilaterally, as a crescent-shaped structure immediately adjacent to the diaphragm. Goats demonstrate monophasic, biphasic, and triphasic reticular contractions. 23 The rumen is visualized in the 8th through 12th intercostal spaces (ICS) and flank on the left, and from the 12th ICS and flank on the right. The rumen wall appears as a thick echoic line, and the ability to differentiate the gas cap, fiber mat, and fluid layer is variable. Rumen motility is discerned indirectly by changes seen in layering of the ruminal content. The dorsal and ventral rumen sacs are most easily distinguished caudally by the presence of the longitudinal groove. 24 The omasum is found on the right side from the 6th to 11th ICS (mainly in the 8th and 9th ICS), appears as a crescent-shaped echoic line medial to the liver, and moves passively with respiration due to its proximity to the diaphragm. Due to the gaseous nature of omasal content, the omasal leaves and omasal wall furthest from the transducer cannot be visualized. 25 The abomasum is visualized along the ventral midline and to the left and right paramedian areas as a heterogeneous, moderately echoic structure with echogenic stippling. Visualization of abomasal folds as prominent echoic bands is possible in approximately two-thirds of goats. 26 Examination of the small intestine takes place from the 8th to 12th ICS and the flank on the right side, from dorsal to ventral midline. Similarly, the large intestine (i.e., spiral colon and cecum) is visualized in the right flank. The descending duodenum can be differentiated based on proximity to abdominal wall and location between two serosal layers of greater omentum, whereas the jejunum and ileum cannot be differentiated from each other. Normal luminal diameters and wall thickness of the small intestine are described in normal goats. 27 The spiral colon and cecum are visible in the caudal right flank. The spiral colon often located medial to the small intestine, is garland-like in appearance, and visualization of only the wall closest to the transducer is possible due to intraluminal gas, which is also true of the cecum. 27 Ultrasonography of the liver for position, parenchymal and surface appearance, as well as visualization of the caudal vena cava, portal vein, and gall bladder are evaluated on the right side between the seventh and ninth ICS (largest visible extent of liver) and variably between the fifth to sixth and the 10th to 12th ICS. The parenchymal pattern of the normal liver consists of numerous fine, homogeneous echoes ( Figure 5 .4). On cross-section, the caudal vena cava is triangular in shape and is visualized in approximately 75% of goats in the 11th and 12th ICS. The portal vein always has a more ventral position and is closer to the liver surface compared with the caudal vena cava. It is circular to oval in cross section, with stellate ramifications into the liver parenchyma, and typically is visualized in all ICS in which liver is visible. The gall bladder is variable in shape and size, depending on amount of bile present and is visualized in most goats from the 9th to 10th ICS. 28 The spleen is visualized on the left side from the 11th and 12th ICS, situated between the rumen and abdominal wall. The parenchymal pattern consists of numerous, homogeneous, weak echogenic shadows. 29 Description of ultrasonography of the urinary and female and male genital tracts can be found in Chapters 12 and 8, respectively. 30", "cite_spans": [{"start": 495, "end": 497, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 636, "end": 639, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 640, "end": 642, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 955, "end": 957, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1443, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1810, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2091, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2638, "end": 2640, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2931, "end": 2933, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3927, "end": 3929, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4130, "end": 4132, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3351, "end": 3359, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Ultrasonography"}, {"text": "Although limited in its availability to referral centers, characterization of the thorax and abdomen in goats using computed tomography (CT) has been described.

Dramatic increases in intraruminal pressure in sheep results in rapid changes in the frequency and type of ruminal contraction patterns responsible for eructation, promoting evacuation of intraruminal gas. 40 Goats are less commonly affected than sheep, and deer are remarkably resistant to bloat. Bloat results as a failure in eructation of gases produced by microbial fermentation in the rumen. Most commonly, eructation fails because the gas remains trapped as tiny bubbles throughout the rumen ingesta (i.e., frothy bloat). 41 Other variations of this type of bloat include foamy or slime bloat, dependent on the class of animal and diet fed (e.g., high concentrate diets). 42, 43 Another type of bloat is the build-up of free gas in the rumen with concurrent failure to eructate (e.g., free-gas bloat). 44 An example is the presence of an intraesophageal foreign body (e.g., potato, sugar beet) impairing eructation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 547, "end": 549, "text": "40", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 869, "end": 871, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1022, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1025, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1151, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diseases of the Forestomachs Bloat"}, {"text": "Pathogenesis. Acute, frothy bloat commonly occurs in animals grazing pastures of bloat-provoking forages. These include alfalfa, clovers (red, white, alsike, ladino, and sweet clover), and certain cereal grains, in contrast to forages relatively resistant to bloat such as sainfoin, birds-foot trefoil, and crown vetch. 45 Field conditions allowing rapid vegetative growth and ingestion of legumes during the vegetative (i.e., prebud) stage pose particular bloat risk, but bloat can occur on dry forage and at full bloom. Bloat-promoting forages are prone to rapid cell disruption and degradation with the release of soluble proteins and other constituents. The highly soluble plant protein ribulose-1,5-bispho sphate carboxylase/oxygenase is especially important in contributing to the formation of stable foam in the rumen. 46, 47 This entrapment of gas within the rumen contents is the primary cause of frothy bloat. The stable foam prevents the coalescence of gas bubbles as well as the clearance of the cardia, impairing eructation. Frothy bloat can also occur on high-grain diets with limited roughage content. Plant factors that suppress bloat include condensed tannins, higher stem to leaf ratios, and plant lipids.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 322, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 826, "end": 829, "text": "46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 830, "end": 832, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diseases of the Forestomachs Bloat"}, {"text": "Reports of frothy or free-gas bloat are rare in farmed deer. A low incidence of frothy bloat likely reflects differences in forage browsing preferences, feedstuffs, pastures typically utilized on farmed deer operations, and an inherent ability of the rumen flora and physiology to consume and tolerate high tanniferous forages. For example, deer have a high concentration of proline-rich tannin-precipitating protein in their saliva, as well as alterations in rumen microflora that accommodate high tannin-containing diets. By forming insoluble complexes with plant proteins, tannins limit the production of stable foam in the rumen and prevent bloat in cattle, small ruminants, and deer species. 48, 49 The occurrence of slime (frothy) bloat under feedlot conditions (i.e., high grain diets) has a similar pathogenesis with the formation of a stable foam in the rumen, preventing eructation. When large amounts of corn or other cereal grains (e.g., barley) are fed, an excess release of mucopolysaccharides and other constituents from rumen bacteria and protozoa occurs. This alters the rumen fluid viscosity and allows a stable slime (or foam) to form. 42, 43 Compounding the issue is a reduction in the amount of saliva contributing to the rumen liquor due to reduced rumination on diets lacking adequate fiber. Saliva normally acts as a buffer and limits the formation of a stable foam. Also, episodes of ruminal acidosis, commonly encountered on high-grain diets, can contribute to alterations in rumen motility patterns and the development of free-gas bloat. 43 In the case of free-gas bloat, failure to eructate has a variety of causes. Physical obstruction of the esophagus with intraluminal foreign bodies (e.g., feedstuffs, masses) or extraluminal compression of the esophagus (e.g., enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, thymoma) can result in bloat, ranging from mild to severe ruminal tympany, depending in the completeness of obstruction. Diseases of the rumen wall can result in mechanical disruption of normal motility patterns, impairing eructation. Systemic diseases, damage to the nerves innervating the esophagus and forestomach, electrolyte imbalances, endotoxemia, and pain can impair eructation. [50] [51] [52] Use of alpha2-agonists (e.g., xylazine) can impair reticulorumen motility, thereby altering eructation. 53, 54 Clinical Signs. Clinical signs of frothy bloat and free-gas bloat due to physical obstruction of the esophagus can be severe and life-threatening compared with bloat due to rumen wall or systemic diseases. Ruminal tympany is observed in the left paralumbar fossa which can extend above dorsal mid-line. The animal may appear anxious and demonstrate a tense abdominal wall and signs of colic. Changes in abdominal contour may be subtle and difficult to fully appreciate in heavily fleeced animals. The rumen may be either hypomotile or hypermotile. Due to compression of the diaphragm and lungs, respiratory distress with flaring of nostrils, open mouth breathing, and an altered stance are common. Death can be rapid if ruminal tympany is left untreated. 40, 50 Diagnosis and Treatment. Bloat is a medical emergency, necessitating decompression of the rumen and stabilizing the animal before a thorough workup is performed. If the animal is not in immediate danger of dying, an orogastric tube can be passed. Most cases of free-gas bloat are relieved with passage of the tube. A thorough history and complete physical examination are then indicated to find the cause of the free-gas bloat. If the bloat is not relieved with passage of an orogastric tube, the tube should be removed and examined for evidence of froth. Frothy bloat can be treated with poloxalene (44 mg/kg) or dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS) (28 mL [1 oz]) delivered by orogastric tube. If frothy bloat is due to high-concentrate feeding, the pH is less than 5.5 and may be treated with mineral oil (100 mL, PO) and/or poloxalene. In emergency situations, other surfactants and detergents may be attempted, including peanut oil (20 to 50 mg/kg), vegetable oil (100 to 200 mL), and hand soap (10 mL).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 697, "end": 700, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 701, "end": 703, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1158, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1161, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1567, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2219, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2224, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2229, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2334, "end": 2337, "text": "53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2338, "end": 2340, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 3096, "end": 3099, "text": "40,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3100, "end": 3102, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diseases of the Forestomachs Bloat"}, {"text": "If the animal is in severe respiratory distress, the clinician should insert a trocar or large needle into the rumen at the paralumbar fossa.

Under intensive grazing conditions, management of exposure (e.g., creep, swath grazing with 24-48 h of wilting) and use of legume varieties engineered to possess less bloat risk can be utilized (e.g., AC Grazeland). 55, 56 Grazing legumes with high leaf-tannin concentrations (e.g., arrowleaf clover, kudzu) usually are safer because tannins form insoluble complexes with legume proteins, which help break down stable foam in the rumen. 41 Monitoring of pasture conditions and recognizing weather events that impact the incidence of bloat should be viewed with respect to effects on plant growth. Examples are the avoidance of grazing during the presence of heavy dew (morning and evening), recent heavy rains, and frost. Important is the recognition that alfalfa still poses a bloat risk even after a killing frost and the observation of the predominant forage present on pastures in order to assess the bloat risk (e.g., regrowth of alfalfa faster than grasses in the fall or the selective grazing habits of the herd). 45 Limiting access to offending pastures and feedstuffs, with slow introduction over the course of 2 to 3 weeks, should be carried out.

Under normal conditions, a low concentration of lactate is found in the rumen and is rapidly metabolized by lactate utilizers such as Selenomonas ruminantium and Megasphaera elsdenii. The introduction of high-concentrate diets with rapidly fermentable sugars and starches leads to unbalanced ruminal fermentation and the accumulation of lactic acid. 60 Initially, the excess fermentable carbohydrates cause a general increase in the growth rate of all bacteria with a resultant increase in volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, which lowers ruminal pH. Bacterial species tolerant of lower ruminal pH, specifically Streptococcus bovis, outpace other bacterial species, resulting in increased lactate production. An increase in lactate concentration further decreases the rumen pH, and eventually it falls to a level where death of protozoa and gram-negative bacterial spp. occurs. In addition, the growth of S. bovis is inhibited and only very acid tolerant lactate-producing Lactobacillus spp. predominate. The rumen pH can decrease to 5, and in severe cases to less than 4.0. Lactate production (L-and D-isoforms) continues to increase. 61, 62 The osmolality of the rumen fluid increases which pulls fluid from the systemic circulation and interstitium into the rumen. Stasis of reticulorumen motility, mucosal damage, and absorption of lactic acids, inflammatory mediators, as well as bacteria and endotoxins into the peripheral circulation results.

A standing or recumbent left flank celiotomy and rumenotomy is suited for type II vagal indigestion (e.g., hardware disease, perireticular abscess). A right-sided approach (right flank, right paramedian, or right paracostal) for exploratory celiotomy is suitable for type III and IV vagal indigestion (e.g., abomasal impaction, pyloric obstruction). Many small ruminants may become recumbent during a standing flank approach. Recumbency can be facilitated by using a lumbosacral epidural anesthesia and sedation or by inhalant general anesthesia in very fractious animals.

Because the abdominal wall is relatively thin, and the rumen may be very distended, the surgeon should take care not to enter the rumen or bowel. To allow exploration and potential evaluation of the rumen, the body wall incision must be of adequate size to allow the surgeon's hand and forearm to comfortably enter the rumen without undue tension on the rumen wall. Once secured and incised, the rumen incision will be smaller than the body wall incision and should be considered. Thorough exploration of the abdomen should take place before the rumenotomy is performed (and is absolutely contraindicated after the rumenotomy is performed). Attention should be paid as to the presence of adhesions and perireticular abscesses while palpating the diaphragm and reticulum. After abdominal exploration, the rumen is secured to the skin by creating a watertight seal with continuous suture. The watertight seal is critical in preventing abdominal contamination. A monofilament (or coated) type of suture on a cutting needle should be used in a Cushing's pattern. It is important to exteriorize a generous part of the dorsal rumen sac to facilitate the creation of the rumenotomy without disrupting the rumen-to-skin seal. To prevent or minimize leakage, the rumen suture bites should be through the seromuscular layer but should not penetrate the mucosa, which could lead to leakage at closure. The suture line is started dorsally at the 12 o'clock position and continued ventrally until the 6 o'clock position is reached. A similar suture line is started on the other side dorsally and continued ventrally, overlapping with the initial suture line to prevent gapping and abdominal contamination at the 6 o'clock position. Two separate suture lines are used to limit the circumferential decrease in lumen size created by one suture line pulled tightly. Once the rumen is sutured to the skin, the rumen-skin suture line is carefully checked for a good seal ( Figure 5 .8). The rumenotomy incision is then made in the center of the exposed, secured rumen ( Figure 5 .9). The rumenotomy incision should be large enough to allow entry of the surgeon's hand into the rumen, but care must be taken to ensure inadvertent incision of the skin-rumen seal does not take place (e.g., 3-cm ventral to 12 o'clock position and extending to 3-cm dorsal to the 6 o'clock position). Once the rumen has been secured and opened, no other modifications should be made to the rumenotomy. Depending on the character of the rumen contents, the rumen can be evacuated by hand or by creating a siphon with a large-bore stomach tube. The surgeon then explores the reticulum and rumen in its entirety, ensuring palpation of the ruminoreticular fold, esophageal orifice, and omasal orifice. All foreign bodies should be removed, regardless of whether they are penetrating or nonpenetrating. To facilitate finding ferromagnetic foreign bodies, a magnet can be held in the surgeon's hand while sweeping the reticular wall. An ultrasound probe (5-MHz sector) within a rectal sleeve can also be taken into the rumen to help identify adhesions and abscesses. Advancement of a hand through the reticulo-omasal canal is not typically feasible in small ruminants but may cautiously be attempted in large sheep and goats.

All soiled materials (e.g., gloves, gowns, drapes) are then removed and replaced, and sterile instruments used in the second part of closure. The second layer of the rumen closure is with absorbable suture in an inverting pattern (e.g., Cushing, Lembert). Suture of this second layer should start at the 12 o'clock position of the rumen incision, and retention sutures securing the rumen to the skin are removed as needed to free enough rumen for closure. When the second layer closure ( Figure 5 .10) is complete, the rumen is cleaned with moist sponges before being returned to the abdominal cavity. Again, it is emphasized that exploration of the abdominal cavity at this point is associated with an increased incidence of septic peritonitis and is contraindicated. The muscle and skin are inspected for gross contamination and cleansed with moist gauzes as needed. Routine closure of the muscle layers and skin are performed, based on surgeon's preference. Given that some contamination will occur during the procedure, incisional infections should be anticipated. The ventral aspect of the skin closure should include two to three interrupted sutures to allow drainage, if necessary, postoperatively.

Despite improvements in management practices and prevention and treatment strategies, diarrhea is still the most common and costly disease affecting neonatal ruminants. [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] Some general preventive measures (e.g., improved sanitation) will decrease the risk of diarrheal disease from any cause. By contrast, specific control measures such as vaccination require the definition of a specific cause of diarrhea. Table 5 .2 lists the agents most likely to cause diarrhea in lambs and kids, tissues or other samples required for diagnosis, and commonly used test methods. The color and consistency of the feces and any gross lesions can appear similar with numerous diseases. Laboratory identification of infectious agents and tissue histopathologic examination are therefore key to establishing a diagnosis (see Chapters 16 and 20) . Because autolysis and secondary bacterial invasion of the gut begin within minutes of death, necropsy samples taken immediately from euthanized lambs and kids yield the most reliable diagnostic material. Mixed infections with two or more pathogens are common, and clinically important farm-specific pathogens change from year to year.

C. perfringens types A, B, C, and D all can cause diarrhea in lambs and kids, but type D is the most common etiologic agent in the United States. 127, 130, 166, 167 Pathogenesis. Clostridial diarrhea occurs in peracute, acute, and chronic forms and commonly is called enterotoxemia or overeating disease. In type C infection, a beta toxin can cause acute hemorrhagic enteritis. Type C infection is seen mostly in lambs or kids younger than 3 weeks of age. An epsilon toxin is responsible for pathologic findings in type D infections. Enterotoxemia usually is seen in rapidly growing feedlot lambs on high-concentrate rations. It also is associated with other feeding changes, including changes in type of pasture. However, it occasionally has been reported in the absence of any dietary changes, particularly in goats. 127, 130, 168 This disease commonly occurs in the fastestgrowing and most well-conditioned animals. Even vaccinated herds (again, more usually goats) can be affected, so it should not be ruled out despite confirmation of previous vaccination. 127 Clinical Signs. The peracute form of clostridial infection is characterized by the rapid onset of severe depression, abdominal pain, profuse and bloody diarrhea, and neurologic signs. Death occurs within hours of onset of clinical manifestations. Sudden death may occur without diarrhea. Sudden death following the onset of neurologic signs is more common in sheep, whereas goats are more likely to show signs of diarrhea before death. 127 Similar but less severe signs are seen in the acute form of the disease. The chronic form occurs more commonly in goats. 127, 167 Diagnosis. Antemortem diagnosis is based on clinical signs. At necropsy, C. perfringens can be cultured from intestinal tissue samples. The significance of a positive culture can be difficult to interpret, however, because these organisms can be a normal component of the gut flora but subsequently proliferate after death. This is true especially of type A, for which a role in actual disease is controversial. 169 Histopathologic examination of sections of the gut can be helpful. Identification of the toxins (namely, the epsilon toxin) in intestinal contents is required for a definitive diagnosis. 127, 130 Because the toxin degrades within several hours of death, its absence does not preclude enterotoxemia as a diagnosis 166 ( Figure 5.13) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 322, "end": 325, "text": "165", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 497, "end": 501, "text": "127,", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 502, "end": 506, "text": "130,", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 507, "end": 511, "text": "166,", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 512, "end": 515, "text": "167", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1174, "text": "127,", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1179, "text": "130,", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1183, "text": "168", "ref_id": "BIBREF167"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1416, "text": "127", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1856, "text": "127", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1982, "text": "127,", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 1986, "text": "167", "ref_id": "BIBREF166"}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2402, "text": "169", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 2590, "end": 2594, "text": "127,", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 2595, "end": 2598, "text": "130", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 2716, "end": 2719, "text": "166", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2722, "end": 2734, "text": "Figure 5.13)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Causes of Diarrhea in Older Lambs, Kids, and Fawns"}, {"text": "Treatment.

Therefore, fecal culture in sheep and goats appears to be of limited benefit in a clinical setting. 5,6 A relatively inexpensive and easily performed method of identifying approximately 50% of all clinically infected animals is acid-fast staining of fecal smears. 4, 5 A PCR fecal assay also is available, but its sensitivity is lower than that of fecal culture. Good diagnostic results can be obtained with serologic testing for antibodies (e.g., agar gel immunodiffusion [AGID] test, enzyme-linked immunospecific assay [ELISA] , complement fixation test) in animals showing clinical signs.

[199] [200] [201] [202] [203] [204] [205] Apart from atresia anovaginalis (i.e., presence of a rectovaginal fistula), all cases are lethal if not surgically corrected. The clinical presentation of affected lambs and kids is progressive abdominal distention with failure to produce feces, as well as signs of abdominal pain, inappetence, weakness, and dehydration. In the case of atresia ani, lack of an anus is apparent, and bulging of the perineum may be observed when the animal strains or with abdominal palpation. A thorough physical examination is important for the discernment of other congenital abnormalities present. 205, 206 Radiography (including contrast fistulogram) and ultrasonography of the abdomen, pelvis, and perineum may help classify the type of anorectal malformation present. Definitive diagnosis of atresia conditions of the colon and small intestine may require an exploratory celiotomy. The presence of other congenital abnormalities should be thoroughly evaluated on physical examination. Surgical repair techniques are described for atresia ani and atresia coli in ruminants; however, based on economical and prognostic considerations, surgical correction of atresia ani is far more likely to be a viable option compared with atresia coli in small ruminants. A description of the surgical correction of atresia ani is reviewed later, whereas the reader is referred elsewhere for the detailed descriptions of creating a permanent colostomy and endto-end anastomoses for the treatment of other intestinal atresia conditions. [207] [208] [209] Although not necessarily lethal, surgical correction of rectovaginal fistulas (as well as rectourethral and rectovesicular fistulas) should also be advocated, as the condition predisposes to urinary tract infections and can result in dilation of the rectum oral to the fistula, resulting in constipation and abdominal pain. Three basic classifications of intestinal atresia classification are described in animals. Type 1, membrane atresia, is caused by a membranous diaphragm occluding the lumen of the intestine. Type 2, cord atresia, is characterized by a fibrous band or muscular cord-like remnant of the gut connecting the two blind ends of oral and aboral intestinal segments. Type 3, blind end atresia, is caused by an absence of a segment of the intestine with unconnected ends and a corresponding gap in the mesentery. The etiopathogenesis of intestinal atresia conditions is likely multifactorial, including reported heritability in lambs. Affected animals should not be used for breeding purposes, ideally with neutering of the animal concurrently at the time of surgical correction of the atretic condition. 207 Preparation of the animal for surgery should include stabilization including the administration of intravenous fluids where appropriate. Surgical correction of atresia ani is best achieved in animals in which a bulge in the perineal skin where the anus should be is appreciable. The procedure is performed using epidural anesthesia with or without light sedation, depending on the tractability of the animal. General anesthesia may be more appropriate in cases where extensive tissue dissection is anticipated. The animal is positioned in sternal recumbency with the perineal area clipped and aseptically prepared. A 1-to 1.5-cm diameter circular incision is made through the skin and subcutaneous tissues at the location of the bulge (or where the anus would normally be located). Blunt dissection is performed cranially to identify the rectal pouch. The pouch is gently retracted caudally with tissue forceps, and the rectum is sutured to the subcutaneous tissue with four to six interrupted sutures. The rectal pouch is incised, and the rectal mucosa sutured to the skin in a simple interrupted pattern or in a simple continuous pattern performed in quadrants. In females with rectovaginal fistulas, these should be located and transected prior to suturing the rectum to the perineal skin. 207, 210 In most cases, the absence of functional anal sphincter musculature is apparent during surgery and fecal incontinence is commonly encountered postoperatively. Postoperative care should include antibiotics and the use of laxatives (e.g., mineral oil) as indicated.

Type II rectal prolapse is a full thickness prolapse of all or part of the rectal ampulla. Type III rectal prolapse is a continuation of a type II rectal prolapse, with the addition of a variable amount of small colon intussuscepted into the rectum.

Rectal prolapse is more common in sheep than in goats and is often associated with short docked tails in lambs. 224 Producers should be encouraged to dock tails at the level of the attachment of the caudal tail fold rather than close to the body, as the latter is associated with an increased incidence of rectal prolapse. Other causes of rectal prolapse include excessive straining associated with diarrhea (e.g., coccidiosis, salmonellosis), chronic coughing, and tenesmus associated with dystocia or urolithiasis. 225 Over-conditioning (i.e., fat animals), grazing lush pastures or feeding of legumes (e.g., alfalfa, clover), and use of growth implants are also implicated as risk factors for the condition. 226 Regardless of the cause, eversion and exposure of the rectal mucosa results in irritation and inflammation, which causes further straining, which results in a vicious cycle of more and more tissue becoming prolapsed.

The type of rectal prolapse and severity of damage to the exposed tissue plays an important role in the type of treatment method selected. In general, the rectum recovers relatively well from injury and an attempt to salvage the prolapsed tissue should be made whenever possible, albeit within reason, as deep necrosis or extensive trauma to the tissue may necessitate surgical resection. A caudal epidural using 2% lidocaine should be performed to facilitate examination and cleansing of the prolapsed tissue while eliminating straining and providing adequate anesthesia for placement of a purse-string suture and surgical procedures, if necessary. Depending on the tractability of the animal, sedation may be required. In sheep with extremely short-docked tails, a lumbosacral epidural may be easier to perform and more likely successful in providing complete anesthesia of the perineum. In very mild, early type I cases, frequent topical application of hemorrhoidal ointment and replacement of the everted tissue may be successful and preclude the use of a purse-string suture. Another quick and inexpensive treatment option for mild cases is the injection of counterirritants (e.g., Lugol's iodine) in the retroperitoneal, perirectal space, either alone or in conjunction with a purse-string suturing. 227 The solution is injected using an 18-gauge needle, deeply (5 cm) within the soft tissues around the anus at the 12, 3, and 9 o'clock positions. Injection at the 6 o'clock position is avoided to prevent swelling and obstruction of the urethra. 228 Although the earlier suggestions are quick and inexpensive, resolution of a rectal prolapse often requires one of the following treatment options. These include: (1) replacement of the prolapse and placement of a purse-string suture, (2) amputation using a prolapse ring, (3) submucosal resection, or (4) resection and anastomosis. 223, 225, 229 In the case of type IV prolapses, an exploratory celiotomy with resection of affected tissue and an end-toend anastomosis may be indicated. With all treatment options, restricted feeding for 24 to 48 h and the administration of mineral oil (or other appropriate laxatives) is recommended. Elimination of risk factors, such as the feeding of dusty hay, as well as the treatment of diarrhea or pneumonia should be carried out following replacement of the prolapse, as these conditions lead to increased abdominal pressures due to coughing or straining. In animals where correction of the rectal prolapse is costprohibitive, immediate harvest or euthanasia is recommended. Tetanus prophylaxis should be provided.

The reader is referred to Chapter 18 for description of both caudal and lumbosacral epidural procedures. Combining xylazine (0.01-0.03 mg/kg) with 2% lidocaine may provide longer analgesia and reduced straining than that obtained by lidocaine anesthesia alone. In animals with irretractable straining, use of an alcohol epidural with either isopropyl alcohol or ethanol may be required to prevent straining for extended periods. This type of anesthesia is permanent and is not without risk, as its use causes demyelination of both sensory and motor nerves. 228 Potential complications include sciatic nerve damage, injection site necrosis, and the inability to pass feces. Therefore, it should be reserved for salvage purposes in animals intended for harvest. Because of the potential sciatic nerve damage, the clinician should perform a test injection of 2% lidocaine before using alcohol, to ensure the epidural is effective in eliminating straining with no apparent ataxia or muscle weakness in the hindlimbs. Following the test injection, a mixture of equal parts lidocaine and alcohol is used at the site previously injected. 228 Replacement and Purse-String Suture. This technique is indicated for the treatment of salvageable rectal prolapses. Following epidural anesthesia, the prolapsed tissue is thoroughly evaluated, and the perineum and prolapsed tissue cleansed with a mild antiseptic. Edema can be reduced with the temporary topical application of hyperosmolar solution, such as granulated sugar or hypertonic saline. The prolapsed tissue is coated with lubricant (e.g., petroleum jelly) and gently manipulated back into its normal position. Placement of a purse-string suture is accomplished using appropriately sized nonabsorbable suture on a cutting needle, with tissue bites situated at the mucocutaneous junction of the anal sphincter. To minimize fecal contamination and allow easy adjustment, the bow-knot should be situated either dorsal or lateral to the anus. To facilitate tightening of the purse-string suture, an appropriately sized syringe case, tube, or the clinician's finger is placed in the rectum during suture tightening which is subsequently removed once the purse-string suture is secured. The purse-string suture is tightened sufficiently to prevent recurrence of the prolapse while allowing the passage of feces. Removal of the purse-string ideally should be within 1 week of placement to minimize suture-tract infection. If possible, topical application of petroleum jelly and hemorrhoidal gel daily will reduce inflammation and edema, facilitating earlier removal of the purse-string suture. 225, 230 Rectal Amputation Using a Prolapse Ring. Placement of a prolapse ring should be considered a salvage procedure. This procedure is often used under field conditions where surgical procedures are not economically or logistically possible. The prolapse ring is inserted into the rectum and an elastrator band placed. If a ligature is used in place of an elastrator band, it should be tightened sufficiently to allow purchase on the prolapse ring. Both the elastrator band or ligature serve to induce vascular compromise and necrosis of the aboral, prolapsed tissue eventually causing it to slough. A fibrotic band forms cranial to the elastrator band and mucosa subsequently grows across the area. Complications include failure due to premature dislodgement of the prolapse ring, rectal stricture, peritonitis, and abscess formation. 229 Submucosal Resection. Submucosal resection involves the removal of necrotic or traumatized mucosa while salvaging healthy, underlying tissue. Advantages of submucosal resection compared with full-thickness resection (amputation) and anastomosis include: faster healing times, less postoperative straining, minimal constriction of lumen diameter, salvage of healthy tissue, the maintenance of the main blood supply thereby minimizing postoperative hemorrhage, and by not exposing the serosa, a reduction in the likelihood of peritonitis and perirectal abscess formation.

The needles are placed through the external anal sphincter and approximately 2 to 4 mm cranial to the prolapse in healthy tissue in order to maintain the prolapse during dissection. Two complete circumferential incisions are made through the mucosa (of healthy tissue) on either side of the tissue to be removed. A longitudinal incision at the same tissue depth is made to connect these circumferential incisions. Deep dissection of the necrotic mucosa and submucosa is carried out, essentially elevating a strip of tissue to be removed but leaving a deep layer of healthy tissue.

Energy requirements for ewes and does carrying twins or triplets are greatly increased during the final 2 months of gestation, because 70 to 80% of fetal growth occurs during this time. Ewes with twins require 180% more energy, and those with triplets need 200 to 250% more dietary energy. Glucose maintenance in ewes pregnant with twins is significantly more prone to disturbance resulting in hypoglycemia than in ewes bearing singletons. 235 Pregnancy toxemia also occurs in association with anorexia caused by other diseases (e.g., foot rot, OPP, CAE) or sudden stresses (e.g., feed or weather changes, predator attacks, hauling). A period of anorexia or lack of sufficient energy intake will result in a negative energy balance. Affected animals begin to mobilize body stores of fat and transport them to the liver. In the liver, fat is catabolized to glycerol and free fatty acids (FFAs). FFAs can be used in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) as an energy source, but not in the direct formation of glucose. Anorexic animals have less ruminal substrate available for production of the glucose precursor, propionic acid. However, oxaloacetate, which is an integral part of the citric acid cycle, is removed from the cycle and converted into glucose. Depletion of oxaloacetate inhibits the normal function of the citric acid cycle, thereby inhibiting the use of FFAs. As the pool of FFAs increases, they are converted to ketone bodies or repackaged into lipoproteins. Because ruminants are not efficient at transporting lipoproteins out of the liver and back to the adipose stores, the lipoproteins overwhelm the liver's ability to handle fats, leading to a massive buildup, and resulting in a fatty liver. Because less substrate is available for glucose formation, more oxaloacetate is \"cannibalized\" from the citric acid cycle, further inhibiting the body's ability to use FFAs. This impairment in turn results in the continued accumulation of ketones. Hypoglycemia, hyperketonemia, and, potentially, uremia and death can occur.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 124, "end": 128, "text": "234,", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 129, "end": 132, "text": "235", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}, {"start": 233, "end": 237, "text": "235,", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}, {"start": 238, "end": 243, "text": "[234]", "ref_id": "BIBREF233"}, {"start": 244, "end": 249, "text": "[235]", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}, {"start": 250, "end": 255, "text": "[236]", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1109, "text": "235", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pregnancy Toxemia and Fatty Liver Syndrome"}, {"text": "Clinical Signs.

Cobalt is needed by rumen microflora to produce cyanocobalamin, or vitamin B 12 , which is a coenzyme for methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) mutase. This enzyme is in turn needed to convert propionate to glucose through the Krebs cycle. Cobalt deficiency leads to the accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA, or methylmalonic acid, which is converted to branchedchain fatty acids that accumulate in the liver. Diets high in grain, which is fermented to propionate, coupled with deficient or marginal cobalt intake, may predispose to this condition. White liver disease has not been reported in the United States, but ill thrift from cobalt deficiency has been observed. It is therefore possible that the disease goes unrecognized in some cases.

The most common sources of excess copper in sheep and goats are trace mineral mixtures and feeds formulated for cattle or horses.

Umbilical masses can be uncomplicated umbilical hernias or involve infection of the umbilical remnants or subcutaneous tissues, with or without concurrent umbilical herniation. 254 Umbilical hernias are a common congenital defect in ruminants. Infection of the umbilicus is a common morbidity in neonates associated with partial or complete failure of passive transfer of immunity due to inadequate colostrum intake. 255 Infection can also be the result of environmental contamination or inappropriate human handling of the umbilical cord, with excessive tension or torsion. Dipping navels with antiseptic solutions shortly after birth is commonplace and proven to reduce umbilical infections under intensive rearing conditions. 256, 257 However, the overzealous use of these solutions (i.e., not allowing the umbilical stalk to dry) or the use of caustic agents (strong tincture of iodine) can cause severe inflammation and infection of the umbilical structures. Physical examination of an animal with an umbilical mass should aim to distinguish between an uncomplicated umbilical hernia from infection of the umbilical remnants with or without the presence of an umbilical hernia. Visual inspection and palpation of the mass includes evaluation of its size, shape, temperature, discharge, pain on manipulation, reducibility and the presence of a hernial ring. Deep palpation of the abdomen in a calm animal (or under sedation) may allow discernment of the umbilical structures involved.

Pinning techniques using umbilical clamps or elastrator bands may be considered for umbilical hernias which are small, nonpainful, display no evidence of infection, and are completely reducible (e.g., do not contain any abdominal viscera following reduction). Pinning is most useful in females and should be used with caution in males due to anatomical considerations and complications associated with urine scalding. The animal is lightly sedated, placed in dorsal recumbency, the skin infiltrated with local anesthetic (e.g., 2% lidocaine), and then followed by reduction of the hernial sac contents back into the abdomen. The skin is then tented away from the body wall and the clamp or elastrator band applied. Large safety pins can be placed in a crossing fashion distal to the elastrator band to keep the band immediately adjacent to the abdominal wall. The ensuing inflammation will cause the hernial ring to adhere to itself and heal within 7 to 14 days. The tissue distal to the elastrator band will undergo ischemic necrosis and will eventually slough. Tetanus prophylaxis should be provided at the time of pinning. The animal should be closely monitored for signs of colic and wound complications. 7 Umbilical Hernia Surgical Resection. In large (greater than 2 cm), uncomplicated umbilical hernias, surgical resection is the treatment of choice. The procedure can be carried out using sedation and local anesthesia (including the use of a high epidural) or under general anesthesia, with the animal positioned in dorsal recumbency. The surgical site is clipped and aseptically prepared. A fusiform skin incision is made around the umbilicus, with sharp and blunt dissection of the subcutaneous tissues to expose the hernial ring at the external rectus sheath. In males, a semilunar skin incision and reflection of the sheath and prepuce may be required, depending on the hernia size. The abdominal cavity is opened just cranial (or caudal) to the hernial ring on the linea alba to allow digital palpation of intra-abdominal structures, including the presence of adhered viscera or infected umbilical remnants. The hernial sac is then carefully excised at the scarred edge of the hernial ring. Enlarged or infected umbilical remnants and adhesions are excised (see later) before closure of the defect in the abdominal wall. Closure of the hernial ring is performed by simple apposition of the incised edges of the external rectus sheath using an absorbable suture in a simple continuous or simple interrupted pattern. If significant tension on the body wall is present, a tension relieving pattern should be used (e.g., a near-far-far-near suture). The subcutaneous tissue is closed in a simple continuous pattern using an absorbable suture, and the skin is closed based on surgeon preference. 254, 261 Alternatively, a closed herniorrhaphy technique, whereby the peritoneum is not incised, may be elected in uncomplicated umbilical hernias.

If an umbilical hernia is present concurrently, the hernia is typically only partially reducible or nonreducible, and the hernial ring is more difficult to fully discern on palpation compared with uncomplicated hernias. Deep abdominal palpation, effectively facilitated by proper restraint and sedation of the animal, may allow differentiation of the different umbilical structures. For example, the umbilical vein courses craniodorsally towards the liver, whereas the umbilical arteries and urachus course caudodorsally towards the bladder. However, ultrasonography of the ventral abdomen is the ideal method to document which umbilical structures are involved, as well as the presence of cellulitis, abscesses, or free abdominal fluid.
