At the beginning, a series of unknown viral pneumonia cases were found in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, and spread rapidly throughout China and other countries, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam [2] . Further investigation revealed a novel coronavirus, termed 2019-nCoVat first and subsequently SARS-CoV-2 [3] , and COVID-19 was the term agreed internationally for the name of the acute respiratory disease syndrome caused by the pathogen ultimately. As of April 5, 2020, according to data released by the National Health Commission of China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in mainland China has reached 81708, including 77078 cured cases, 3331 death cases, and 88 suspected cases [4] . A recent study by Huang and colleagues [5] focused on the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, treatment and clinical outcomes of nonpregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. However, there are some reports on pregnant women with COVID-19 infection at present [6] [7] [8] [9] . In order to address the clinical features of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19, we retrospectively reviewed clinical records, laboratory findings and chest CT scan of 10 pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (tested positive on maternal throat swab), who were admitted to Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from January 23th to February23th, 2020.",

All eleven live births had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 10 ( Table 3) . 11 newborns (including twins) underwent throat swab test for COVID-19 after birth and the results were negative. From birth to February 25, 2020, which was a 14-day period, no neonatal death or neonatal asphyxia was observed, and no one presented with fever, cough, or diarrhea. (Table 4) The chest CT images [5, 13, 14] , including HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 demonstrate that coronaviruses are a significant public health threat causing significant loss of life [15, 16] . When the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected pregnant women, poor obstetric outcomes can be resulted, including maternal morbidity and death [17] [18] [19] [20] , but there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present COVID-19 epidemic [17] . The COVID-19 has at least 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV [21] . However, the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women remains unknown at present. Due to the normal maternal physiologic changes and immune suppression during the pregnant period, these women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens. During the Asian flu epidemic in 1957-1958, 10% of mortality occurred in pregnant women, and the fatality rate of pregnant women was twice as high as that of infected women who were non-pregnant [22] . A case-control study [18] on the effect of SARS among pregnant women and nonpregnant women revealed that maternal mortality rate, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), the intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f higher in pregnant SARS patients. Huang C et al [5] reported that the COVID-19 infection of non-pregnant people caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to SARS, of which common symptoms were fever (98%), cough (76%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%), less common symptoms were sputum production (28%), headache (8%), haemoptysis (5%), and diarrhoea (3%), and the complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome (29%), RNA anaemia (15%), acute cardiac injury (12%) and secondary infection (10%) . However, in our study, none of the ten pregnant women developed or died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia but only showed similar clinical symptoms to non-pregnant adult patients such as fever and cough, whereas others common symptoms such as myalgia, sore throat and dyspnea were not observed. This is probably due to the fact our hospital is not a designated hospital for COVID-19 and lacks serious patients with typical symptoms, only a small number of cases were enrolled in our observation and the patients' length of stay was short.",

The produce of pleural effusion probably due to postpartum physiological changes in pregnant women. Therefore, non-specific manifestations such as pleural effusion should also be attached with great attention in diagnosis of COVID-19 infection if there is postpartum fever. In Wuhan where the incidence of COVID-19 is exceptionally high, it is necessary to do pulmonary CT screening on admission, which will help to detect asymptomatic infection and latent period patients, thus reducing the transmission of virus between people and nosocomial infection.",
