Several antibodies have also shown good prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in relevant animal models of viral disease. Surprisingly, only one antiviral mAb has been licensed to date; it is used to prevent infection with respiratory syncytial virus in at-risk infants. Certain paradigms of mAbs prevailing in industry and academia are obstacles to the development of further antiviral antibodies for clinical use. There is a perception that mAbs are much more effective in prophylactic than therapeutic use, offer limited breadth of protection against different viral strains, are prone to select neutralization escape variants and need to be given in high doses, which are still comparatively costly to manufacture. Based on a review of the literature and our own data, we propose that by combining two or more noncompeting neutralizing antibodies, viral escape can effectively be controlled and in case of synergistic action of the mAbs it may be possible to significantly reduce the total antibody concentration required for protection. The combination of mAbs with specific antiviral drugs has the potential to expand their use from pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis to therapy of acute and chronic viral infections.",

It also follows that late PEP or early therapy of an acute infection will be possible in certain circumstances, provided that the main mechanism of viral clearance is antibody mediated and that the mAb reaches sufficient concentrations in the target organs of viral replication (e.g. the brain). Chronic infections, however, are very unlikely to respond to therapy with mAbs unless immune escape is prevented by reducing viral replication independently of antibody action (e.g. by an antiviral drug) and the immune response is modulated such that additional effector mechanisms for viral clearance are stimulated.",

            "text": "Murine mAbs against transplant rejection and blood clotting were the first monoclonal antibodies to enter the clinic in the late 1980s, but the induction of immunological side effects was an obstacle to the development of further products. The advent of recombinant antibody technology in the 1990s then allowed the generation of less immunogenic chimeric mouse-human and later \"humanized\" mouse mAbs, which has set off an annual 20% growth of the mAb market to currently 30 billion US$/a (Baker 2005) . At present 152 novel mAbs are undergoing clinical trials, mostly for cancer or immunological disorders and approximately 10% for infectious diseases. Despite these successes, only a handful of antiviral antibodies are currently in clinical trials, mainly against HBV and HCV. Only one mAb is licensed and marketed for prevention of a viral disease (Palivizumab), which is given to at-risk infants for the prevention of infection with respiratory syncytial virus. While economic considerations with respect to the smaller market size of anti-infectives and comparatively high production costs of mAbs may partly explain this discrepancy, we think that certain scientific paradigms prevailing in industry and academia are important obstacles to the development of further antiviral antibodies for clinical use. The following chapter will therefore try to shed light on the generation and preclinical evaluation of antiviral mAbs and discuss possibilities to improve their properties based on our own data and a review of the literature.",

The antigen-binding site of an antibody is composed of six hypervariable or complementarity determining regions (CDRs), of which three are located within the variable domains of the light-chain (V L ) and heavy chain (V H ), respectively. In the immune system a large repertoire of different variable domains determining the antibody specificity is generated through combinatorial assembly of germline gene segments (V, D and J), with each B-cell expressing a different antibody specificity. Antigen exposure leads to clonal expansion of those B-cells producing antigenbinding antibodies and induces somatic mutations in the V genes, which results in further selection of clones with improved affinities of the antibodies (affinity maturation).",

Because fully human mAbs will theoretically not induce any immune response in the patient, several in vivo and in vitro technologies were developed for their generation (reviewed by Hoogenboom 2005) . Historically, in vitro immortalization of peripheral human B-cells isolated from infected or immunized donors was performed with Epstein Barr virus to subsequently isolate and identify antibody secreting clones (Steinitz et al. 1977) . This technique has recently been modified to increase the number of transformed IgG+ B-memory cells by in vitro stimulation with CpG-oligonucleotides and sorting of memory cells using the surface marker CD22, which has resulted in recovery of a high number of specific antibody clones, which have undergone in-vivo affinity maturation (Traggiai et al. 2004) . Transgenic mice with human immunoglobulin genes have been generated to study the maturation of antibody genes. They are immunized with the antigen of interest and monoclonal antibodies are rescued by fusing mouse B-cells with mouse myeloma cells (Lonberg 2005) . The resulting antibodies are in-vivo affinity-matured.",

Cloning of all different antigen binding regions is possible because the hypervariable regions which are responsible for antigen specificity (CDRs) are flanked by constant regions (framework regions, FR) which correspond to families of germline antibody genes for which the genetic sequences are available. Because the heavy and light chains are amplified and cloned by two separate PCR reactions, the library also contains pairings not present in the donor lymphocytes, which further increases its size. The antibody phages are incubated with the antigen of interest and specifically binding phages are rescued together with the genetic information coding for the specific antibody gene.

Finally, three to four antibodies are selected as product leads and stable production clones of a suitable cell line (e.g. PER.C6 \u00ae ) are generated (figure 1). Excellent laboratory manuals are available describing the technical procedures in detail (Kontermann and D\u00fcbel 2001 Figure 1 . Generation of human monoclonal IgG antibodies from phage display libraries. mRNA is isolated from immunized or infected lymphocytes donors, reverse transcribed into cDNA and all V H and V L genes are amplified using a set of approx. 40 consensus primers directed against the conserved framework regions of the variable antibody genes. The antibody genes are cloned in a phagemid vector and infectious phages each expressing a different single-chain antibody molecule (the V H and V L chains being linked by an artificial polypeptide spacer) are rescued from bacteria using a defective helper phage (Kramer et al. 2003) . The resulting \"antibody phage library\" is screened with viral antigen in different formats for specific binders during 2-3 rounds of selection. The rescued antibody genes are then recloned in appropriate vectors and transiently expressed as fully human IgG1 molecules. These are used to determine the potency, affinity and epitopes of the antibodies. A stably transfected production cell line is generated for each lead antibody. The whole process can be performed in approx. 9 months.",

Furthermore, surface proteins of viruses tend to adopt oligomeric configurations in which aminoacids from two molecules may contribute to one epitope (Daffis et al. 2005) . It is therefore very useful to employ different antigen formats for screening of the libraries, including whole purified virions, virus like particles, recombinant proteins and eukaryotic cells expressing viral surface proteins. By performing the second round of selections on a different antigen format than the first, unspecific reactivity can be reduced. Certain combinations of antigen formats, e.g. selection on cells expressing viral surface proteins followed by selection on whole virions, may yield the majority of neutralizing antibodies recovered from a library ).",

            "text": "Potent neutralizing antibodies need to be selected as quickly and efficiently as possible from the large number of antigen binding phage antibodies, which can be in the order of many thousand. In principle, this is possible by characterizing the molecules biochemically by measuring e.g. their affinities to the virus, or functionally by determining their neutralizing potency. While the term \"neutralization\" in its broadest sense denotes the inhibitory effect of an antibody on viral infectivity or replication, it is more often specifically used when referring to the inhibition of viral attachment and early entry functions (endocytosis, fusion, uncoating). There has been some debate as to whether neutralization of viruses is due to binding of an antibody to one critical site on the virion (leading to a single-hit kinetic of neutralization) or to epitopes present in multiple copies on the virus surface (multiple-hit kinetic). In the latter case neutralization can be regarded as a function of antibody affinity and concentration, which determine whether a critical number of antigens have reacted with the antibody (so called relative occupancy model of neutralization). Many experimental data point to the multiple-hit kinetic and occupancy model, with 4-7 IgG molecules required to neutralize picornaviruses, 70 to neutralize influenza and 225 to neutralize rabies virus. Interestingly, for several viruses a linear relationship between the number of antibodies required for neutralization and the particle surface area was found, supporting the idea that coating of the virion surface by any antibody is sufficient for neutralization (high occupancy or coating theory). Exhaustive reviews of the subject have been published by Klasse & Sattentau 2002 . However, other molecular mechanisms of neutralization have also been proposed which may or may not follow the occupancy model, including induction of conformational changes in the capsid or envelope proteins, aggregation of viral particles, complement fixation and signalling to the interior of the virion or the infected cell.",

            "text": "Affinity measurement using plasmon surface resonance is widely used to characterize the binding ability of antibodies to their targets and in many cases a correlation can be observed with their biological activity. For virus neutralization, however, it has repeatedly been reported that no such correlation was found (Wu et al. 2005 . A possible explanation could be that a low affinity to a functionally important neutralizing epitope results in a higher potency of the mAb compared with a higher affinity to a less important epitope. This may be illustrated with the SARS coronavirus neutralizing mAbs CR3014 and CR3022, which we isolated from a na\u00efve and an immune library, respectively (van den Brink et al. 2005, ter Meulen, unpublished) . Both block binding of SARS-CoV to its cellular receptor ACE2 on Vero cells, as shown in FACS-experiments using the recombinant expressed S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD). Both antibodies bind to the RBD in a non-competing fashion, as shown in competitive ELISA. However, CR3014 has a rather low affinity to recombinant S1 (K D = 27 nM) but a reasonable potency (7.6 \u00b5g/ml for 100% neutralization), whereas CR3022 has a high affinity (300 pM) but lower potency (50 \u00b5g/ml). Obviously the mAbs recognize either two different neutralizing epitopes on the RBD, or one binds to another epitope in the S1 subunit thereby inducing a conformational change in the RBD (allosteric effect) or possibly blocks interaction with a putative co-receptor of SARS-CoV. Therefore we find it preferable to characterize all antibodies first in a rapid screening assay for in vitro neutralization, and thereafter define the biochemical characteristics of the most potent ones. However, the neutralizing activity of an antibody may involve factors not present in standard neutralization, i.e. cell culture protection assay, such as complement fixation. Furthermore, if the in vivo neutralizing activity involves antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or perhaps signalling to infected cells, mAbs with these properties will also be missed. It has been observed that in vitro potency may not be predictive of in vivo potency, and even nonneutralizing antibodies may confer in vivo protection (Iacono-Conors et al. 1996 , Griffin et al. 1997 , Mozdzanowska et al. 1997 . Since high-throughput screening of antibodies in animals is not feasible, there is a need for the development of additional in vitro assays for measuring antiviral antibody functions other than blocking of attachment and entry.",

If the epitopes recognized are linear, they can be mapped by pepscan analysis with overlapping peptides corresponding to the amino acid (aa) sequence of the protein and by subsequent alanine scan to identify the aa critical for binding. Conformational domains are mapped by sequencing escape variants of the virus generated with subneutralizing antibody concentrations. If the crystal structure of the target protein is known, the 3D localisation of the amino acids critical for neutralization can be determined and the molecular mechanism of neutralisation may be speculated upon (Daffis et al. 2005) .

These systems are convenient to test pre-or post-exposure prophylaxis with a mAb, especially if there is a clear dose-response of virus challenge and mortality as well as mAb concentration and protection. Unfortunately, for many viral infections no small animal models are available which would generate a clinical and pathological state more closely resembling human disease.

These initially encouraging results led to a recent proof-of-concept study designed to mimick therapeutic vaccination by administering a cocktail of three neutralizing human mAbs (2G12, 2F5, 4E10), interrupting antiretroviral therapy (ART) and measuring the level of viral rebound (Trkola et al. 2005) . Eight chronically and six acutely HIV-1 infected patients, all with undetectable levels of viremia while on ART, received multiple infusions of the mAbs over an 11-week period. ART was discontinued one day after commencing the antibody treatment. The HIV strains harboured by all patients were shown to be highly sensitive to neutralization with at least two mAbs. No side effects of the mAb therapy were observed, despite 2F5 and 4E10 having been shown to be crossreactive with cardiolipin (Haynes et al. 2005) . Viral rebound to pre-ART plasma levels occurred without apparent delay in six chronic and two acute patients. Rebound was delayed in the remaining six patients, but then rose to pre-ART levels in one acute and one chronic subject in the presence of high plasma concentrations of the mAbs. In two acute patients, rebound peaked 2-4 logs below pre-ART levels and remained low after the mAbs were cleared from the circulation. One subject had no detectable viral rebound. Surprisingly, most of the effect of the treatment could be attributed to mAb 2G12 only. Patients with a delay in rebound had very high plasma levels of this mAb with on average 400 times its IC 90 and more than double the highest effective dose for 2F5 and 4E10 in any patient, probably due to the longer plasma half-life of 2G12. Furthermore, 2G12 was the only antibody that rebound viruses escaped, while remaining sensitive to 2F5 and 4E10. It was therefore speculated that the plasma concentrations achieved for 2F5 and 4E10 were below a crucial threshold needed to control the virus. In conclusion, this study showed that control of HIV by neutralizing mAbs may be possible but will require high concentrations of combinations of antibodies capable of preventing immune escape or combinations with other antiviral drugs reducing replication of the virus.",

Immune escape induced by antiviral mAbs is less likely to occur in pre-and postexposure prophylaxis and therapy of acute viral infections, because of the effective polyclonal immune and T-cell response.

Rabies virus infection in man is 100% fatal, unless the vaccine and human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) are administered immediately after exposure. The disease is most frequently caused by transmission of one of several serotypes of Lyssa virus, genotype 1 through the bite of an infected, rabid canine. Several additional animal species, notably bats, harbour other of the 12 currently known genotypes of Lyssa virus (rabies and rabies-like viruses), some of which have caused disease in man. Therefore, any mAb used for replacement of HRIG must provide the same breadth of protection, most importantly against rabies viruses transmitted by rabid animals (\"street viruses\").

Neutralizing antibodies can protect against challenge with HIV-1 in vivo if present at appropriate concentrations at the time of virus challenge, but their role in the control of established infection is unclear. Autologous neutralizing antibodies (Nab) can be detected as early as 52 days after detection of HIV-specific antibodies. The viral inhibitory activity of Nab results in complete replacement of neutralization-sensitive virus by successive populations of resistant virus, involving primarily changes in N-linked glycosylation (Wei et al. 2003) . In a phase I study with a cocktail of two neutralizing mAbs (2F5, 4E10, 2G12), immune escape was observed with one of the mAbs (Trkola et al. 2005) . Experimentally, even high serum concentrations of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, either singly or as a cocktail, have little sustained effect on viral load in established HIV-1 infection in hu-PBL-SCID mice. In some instances, virus replication of neutralization-sensitive virus continues even in the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibody. In most instances, neutralization escape occurs in a few days, even from a cocktail of three antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes (Poignard 1999) . The authors concluded that humoral immunity is unlikely to play a significant role in the control of established HIV-1 infection in humans. Similar observations have been made in hepatitis B and C (Rehermann and Nascimbeni 2005) . It is therefore questionable whether the action of neutralizing mAbs can be improved such that the immune escape problem in chronic infection can be controlled by antibody alone.",

We have observed synergistic neutralization of SARS-CoV. Human mAb CR3014 isolated from a na\u00efve antibody phage library and non-competing mAb CR022 isolated from an immune library were combined in equimolar ratios and the concentration required for 100% and 50% neutralization of SARS-CoV was determined. Applying a mathematical model based on the massaction law principle (Chou and Talalay 1984) revealed that CR3014 and CR3022 neutralize SARS-CoV synergistically in vitro, with dose reduction indices of 3 and 20, respectively. Mechanistically, cooperative binding of mAbs may induce conformational changes in the antigen thereby altering affinities (allosteric effect), lead to intermolecular interaction of bivalent antibodies or result in interaction of the Fc regions of antibodies brought into close contact (Klonisch et al. 1996) . As determined by ELISA, CR3014 and CR3022 bind simultaneously to the RBD of the S1 subunit of the glycoprotein spike of SARS-CoV. However, measuring separate, sequential and simultaneous binding of the mAbs in Biacore did not reveal enhanced affinity of the antibody mixture over the individual affinities, especially for C3022. Neutralization escape variants generated with one anti-SARS-CoV mAb were effectively neutralized by the other. When administered prophylactically to ferrets before intratracheal challenge with SARS-CoV, mAb CR3014 prevented lung pathology due to viral replication and abolished shedding of the virus in pharyngeal secretions at a dose of 10mg/kg (ter Meulen et al. 2004) . The synergistic action of the mAbs may allow for a lower total combined antibody dose to reach the same potency, which increases the economic attractiveness of a potential product for immunoprophylaxis of SARS.",

Long-term immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) dramatically improved post-transplantation survival, but recurrent HBV still occurred in up to 36% of the recipients due to the occurrence of immune escape mutants. More recently, combination HBIG and lamivudine has been shown to effectively prevent HBV recurrence in patients posttransplantation. However, optimum doses and duration for these drugs are not yet clear. The combination of lamivudine 300 mg/day and low-dose HBIG was reported to prevent post-transplantation recurrence of hepatitis B, even in the presence of viral replication in the pre-transplant period (Karasu et al. 2004) . Furthermore, combination therapy resulted in a cost-effective strategy with an average cost-effectiveness ratio of $252,111/recurrence prevented compared with $362,570/recurrence prevented in the monotherapy strategy. It was concluded that combination prophylaxis with HBIG and lamivudine is highly effective in preventing recurrent HBV, may protect against the emergence of resistant mutants, and is significantly more costeffective than HBIG monotherapy with its associated rate of recurrent HBV (Han et al. 2000) . However, in low-risk liver transplant patients who were HBsAg-positive/HBV DNA-negative before transplantation and had received HBIg for at least 6 months without HBV recurrence, lamivudine alone was effective for prevention of HBV recurrence (Naoumov et al. 2001) . Another study also concluded that lamivudine monotherapy after a short course of lamivudine and HBIg was equally as efficacious in preventing HBV recurrence as HBIg plus lamivudine during the first 18 months after liver transplantation (Buti et al. 2003) .",

In a mouse model of lymphocytic choriomeningits (LCMV) infection, monoclonal antibody expression in transgenic mice alone was unable to prevent the establishment of persistent infection due to generation of neutralization escape variants. Daily administration of ribavirin resulted in elimination of the virus after two weeks and virus isolated at earlier time points was shown to remain sensitive to mAb neutralization (Seiler et al. 2000) . It was concluded that the main effect of ribavirin was reduction of viral replication efficiency, which rendered the appearance of antibody escape variants less frequent and lowered viral titers sufficiently so that CTLs were able to control the virus. In agreement with this study, virus-specific immune plasma was shown to enhance the beneficial effect of ribavirin on primate survival and virus replication after infection with another member of the arenavirus family, the Lassa virus (Jahrling et al. 1984) .",

The state of monoclonal antibody technology now makes is possible to replace human sera by custom-tailored human monoclonal antibodies, thereby solving the safety, cost and supply problems inherent in blood products derived from human donors. However, only a few biotech companies have currently taken mAbs for HIV, hepatitis B, C, CMV and RSV infection in preclinical or clinical development. Economically, monoclonal antibodies are seen as less attractive antivirals than small molecule drugs due to the approximately two-fold increase in cost and time required to produce clinical-grade material. Scientifically, the possibly limited breadth of protection, generation of immune escape variants and uncertain clinical efficacy in case of established acute or chronic infection are perceived as major obstacles to the development of mAb products for control of viral infections.",

Based on our own data and published evidence we therefore propose a paradigm shift, predicting that a broad-scale screening for synergistic action of antibody cocktails as stand-alone or in combination with antivirals may solve many of the above outlined problems. Crucial to the discovery process of highly potent antiviral mAbs is a high-throughput screening based on in vitro or ideally in vivo neutralization, which should systematically investigate the possible neutralizing synergy of noncompeting antibodies. Synergy of the mAbs with antivirals could also be included in an early screening step. If the potency of an individual antibody needs to be increased, selection for an improved k on should be performed. Novel antibody formats based on multimerization of antigen-binding fragments may lead to molecules with high avidity and increased neutralizing potency.",
