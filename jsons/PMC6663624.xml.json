To avoid overinterpretation, we only included genes with at least 1 read per million mapped reads in at least 30 samples. LIMMA was used in conjunction with voom, which weighs the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts needed for accurate generalized linear modeling. A candidate list of differentially expressed genes were identified based on an absolute fold change >2.0 and Benjamini\u2013Hochberg adjusted p-value of LIMMA's moderated t-test (p < 0.05). For functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis, the candidate probes were analyzed in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID),15 and processes and pathways were selected based on Benjamini\u2013Hochberg adjusted p-values < 0.05.16 Principal component analysis (PCA)17 was used to visualize the separation of the 2 groups. Further unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed probes was done by applying the Ward's minimum variance criterion linkage method18 with Euclidean distance and presented in a heatmap.",

Characteristics were compared between training and testing sets using Student's t-test, Mann\u2013Whitney, Fisher's exact, or chi-square testing as appropriate. A logistic regression model was fit using recursive feature elimination with 5-fold cross-validation to reduce the number of predictors and thus achieve a parsimonious model.19 In the model fitting process, a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (AUC) was the metric used for selecting the optimal model. Threshold selection was based on model performance metrics in the training set. We then validated the threshold in the testing set. In addition, Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan\u2013Meier curves were fit for CLAD-free survival and compared between groups diagnosed with A-grade ACR on biopsy vs all other clinical conditions, and between predicted ACR vs no predicted ACR using the genomic classifier model.",

This 4-gene model achieved an AUC of 0.72 in the training set (Figure 3\na). We then defined a classification threshold that favored specificity (76%) over sensitivity (54%), which yielded 70% classification accuracy (Figure 3b). In the independent test set of 54 samples, the model exhibited similar performance with an AUC of 0.72 (Figure 3c).

For instance, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes TCR signaling pathway was enriched 21.5-fold during A-grade ACR, including genes for CD8a, CD8b, lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), and CD3e. CD8 acts to stabilize binding of the TCR to the peptide-major histocompatibility complex, while also localizing LCK to the TCR/CD3 complex to facilitate early signaling events during T-cell activation.23 We have also previously shown that BAL CP gene expression of CD8 and LCK is associated with the development of CLAD.24 In addition, the cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction pathway was enriched 6.5-fold and included CXCR3 and interferon gamma. This finding is corroborated by previous work showing that protein concentrations of the interferon gamma\u2013inducible CXCR3-binding chemokines in the BAL fluid are associated with A-grade ACR and other lung injury patterns, as well as with CLAD.25, 26, 27 Finally, enrichment for pathways related to cell adhesion, NK cell\u2013mediated cytotoxicity, and allograft rejection add additional support of the biological relevance of BAL CP gene expression during A-grade ACR.",

We chose a threshold for the model that prioritized specificity over sensitivity. Our rationale was aimed at better identifying clinically significant ACR at high risk of progression to CLAD. Recognizing the well-described shortcomings of TBBX, it is not surprising that our model reclassifies cases of histopathologic A-grade ACR as no ACR and other cases of no histopathologic A-grade ACR as positive for ACR. The performance of this genomic classifier improved with increasing histopathologic A-grade, for which there is reported greater observer agreement and therefore confidence in the ACR diagnosis.6, 7, 8 In addition, our classifier model indicated ACR for all cases of SSAR, which is a strong risk factor for CLAD.11 Given the importance of ACR as a potentially modifiable CLAD risk factor, our most intriguing finding is that classification indicating ACR also discriminated risk of CLAD-free survival, especially in the year following biopsy, whereas a histopathologic diagnosis of A-grade ACR did not. Finally, the highest incidence of CLAD or death in the year after biopsy was seen in the 37 cases where histopathology was negative for A-grade ACR but where the genomic classifier predicted ACR. None of these cases were treated for rejection at the time. We can hypothesize that corticosteroid treatment could have reduced the risk of CLAD in this group, but this hypothesis requires prospective evaluation in a clinical trial.",

Specifically, increased gene expression related to T-cell activation, and cytotoxicity was common to each of these studies.28, 29 These similar conclusions are interesting, especially because our study relied on a different platform to measure gene expression: this study used RNASeq, whereas the prior studies used microarray. In studies of T-cell activation, there has been a high correlation of gene expression profiles between RNASeq and microarray platforms using the same set of samples.30 However, RNASeq was superior in detecting low abundance transcripts and demonstrated a broader dynamic range than microarray, therefore allowing the detection of more differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, performing RNASeq allows for the avoidance of technical issues found using microarray probes (e.g., cross-hybridization, non-specific hybridization, and limited detection range of individual probes). In addition, RNASeq does not rely on pre-designed detection probes; thus, there are no issues associated with probe redundancy and annotation, which simplifies the interpretation of the data.",

IL-32 is expressed by IL-2\u2013activated T cells and NK cells and plays a role in acute graft-versus-host disease after hematopoietic cell transplantation.33 KLRK1 is a receptor expressed by NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes; it mediates activation in NK cells and costimulation in T cells.34 Collectively, this 4-gene model is consistent with the paradigm of ACR and CLAD pathobiology. Specifically, ACR is characterized by activated immune cells including CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, and NK T cells, which drive the cytotoxicity responsible for allograft injury that eventually leads to CLAD. Future prospective studies should test whether this genomic classifier leads to earlier or more appropriate treatment of ACR, an intervention that might reduce CLAD.",

Although our study included independent training and testing cohorts, all patients were from a single center; future studies would benefit from the inclusion of an external validation cohort. We are reassured by the fact that the biological processes and pathways enriched in our gene list are consistent with expectations. We also acknowledge that 9% of samples selected for inclusion were inadequate for RNASeq either because of degraded RNA or low RNA concentrations. This is similar to the 8% rate of inadequate TBBX reported in lung transplant recipients.6 However, the proportion of inadequate BAL samples for RNASeq could probably be reduced to nearly 0% with the use of RNA stabilization solutions and RNASeq library construction kits designed for low input.

Each dot on the graph corresponds to a gene. The fold difference in expression between A-grade ACR and others is graphed on the x axis (logarithm to the base 2-fold changes). The p-values for each gene are graphed on the y axis (negative logarithm to the base 10 of the t-test Benjamini\u2013Hochberg adjusted p-values). The vertical dashed lines correspond to absolute fold difference of -2.0 and 2.0. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to a Benjamini-adjusted p-value of 0.05. Differentially expressed genes (n = 72) are labeled red (selected interesting genes are labeled with official gene symbol as well). Additional black dots in the significance range (n = 5) represent chimera transcripts removed from the gene list. No genes were expressed at significantly lower levels during A-grade ACR.
