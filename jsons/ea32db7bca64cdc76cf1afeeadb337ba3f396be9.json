Our model here is based on our model of this epidemic in [5] , which was focused on the early phase of this epidemic (January 20 through January 29) in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the early outbreak.

Soon after, the epidemic in Wuhan passed beyond the early exponential growth phase, to a phase with slowing growth. In this work, we assume that these major government measures caused the transmission rate to change from a constant rate to a time dependent exponentially decreasing rate. We identify this exponentially decreasing transmission rate based on reported case data after January 29. We then extend our model of the epidemic to the central region of China, where most cases occurred. Within just a few days after January 29, our model can be used to project the time-line of the model forward in time, with increasing accuracy, to a final size.",

We set S(t 0 ) in (2.2) to 1, 400, 050, 000. We set t 0 = 5.0, I(t 0 ) = 3.7, U (t 0 ) = 0.2 and R(t 0 ) = 0. In Figure 4 , we plot the graphs of CR(t) (cumulative reported cases), CU (t) (cumulative unreported cases), R(t), and U (t) from the numerical simulation. In Figure 5 we plot the graphs of the reported cases R(t) and the infectious pre-symptomatic cases I(t). The blue dots are obtained from the reported cases data ( Table 2) for each day beginning on January 26, by subtracting from each day, the value of the reported cases one week earlier. Our model transmission rate \u03c4 (t) can be modified to illustrate the effects of an earlier or later implementation of the major public policy interventions that occurred in this epidemic. The implementation one week earlier (24 is replaced by 17 in (4.1)) is graphed in Figure 6 (top). All other parameters and the initial conditions remain the same. The total reported cases is approximately 4, 500 and the total unreported cases is approximately 1, 100. The implementation one week later (24 is replaced by 31 in (4.1)) is graphed in Figure 6 (bottom). The total reported cases is approximately 820, 000 and the total unreported cases is approximately 200, 000. The timing of the institution of major social restrictions is critically important in mitigating the epidemic. The number of unreported cases is of major importance in understanding the evolution of an epidemic, and involves great difficulty in their estimation. The data from January 20 to February 15 for reported cases in Table 2 , was only for tested cases. Between February 11 and February 15, additional clinically diagnosed case data, based on medical imaging showing signs of pneumonia, was also reported by the Chinese CDC. Since February 16, only tested case data has been reported by the Chinese CDC, because new NHC guidelines removed the clinically diagnosed category. Thus, after February 15, there is a gap in the reported case data that we used up to February 15. The uncertainty of the number of unreported cases for this epidemic includes this gap, but goes even further to include additional unreported cases.",

Our model formulation can be applied with varying values for the fraction f . In Figure 7 , we provide illustrations with the fraction f = 0.4 (top) and f = 0.6 (bottom). The formula for the time dependent transmission rate \u03c4 (t) in (4.1) involves a new value for \u03c4 0 and \u00b5 for each case. The final size of the epidemic when f = 0.4 is approximately 164,700 cases, and the final size of the epidemic when f = 0.6 is approximately 110,700 cases. From these simulations, we see that estimation of the number of unreported cases has major importance in understanding the severity of this epidemic. The number of days an asymptomatic infected individual is infectious is uncertain. We simulate in Figure 8 the model with \u03bd = 1/3, which means that asymptomatic infected individuals are infectious on average 3 days before becoming symptomatic. The result is a small decrease in the final size of the epidemic, as compared to the case that \u03bd = 1/7. We illustrate the importance of the level of government imposed public restrictions by decreasing the value of \u00b5 in formula (4.1) for \u03c4 (t). In Figure 9 we set \u00b5 = 0.09 instead of \u00b5 = 0.12, and the result is a significant increase in the number of cases. ",

In our model formulation, we divide infectious individuals into asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals. The symptomatic infectious phase is also divided into reported and unreported cases. Our model formulation is based on our work [5] , in which we developed a method to estimate epidemic parameters at an early stage of an epidemic, when the number of cumulative cases grows exponentially. The general method in [5] , was applied to the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China, to identify the constant transmission rate corresponding to the early exponential growth phase.",
