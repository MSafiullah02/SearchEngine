In total, 45 proteins from the complete ACE2 network are interacting with 38 from 94 human host proteins for SARS-CoV-2. The strongest connection between networks was associated with INS, which interacted with 12 host proteins from SARS-CoV-2/Human Interactome. Other top interactors were CAT, CCL2, CDK4, CALM1 connected with at least 6 host proteins. Among host proteins directly interacting with virus proteins, the strongest connection with ACE2 network occurs by ALB (31 interactors form ACE2 network) and CAV1 (13 interactors) (Figure 3 ). Enrichment analysis of the signaling within ACE2-tissue specific network. By applying enrichment analysis for analyzing signaling pathways associated with analyzed networks we used KEGG database and Reactome databases. According to the KEGG database, only the RAS and protein digestion and absorption pathways were shared between all six compared networks ( Figure  4B ). Analysis of signaling pathways using the Reactome database showed analogous pathways, for metabolism of angiotensinogen to angiotensin and peptide hormone metabolism. Reactome pathway analysis also showed that intrinsic pathway of fibrin clot formation, neutrophil degranulation, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) Figure 2 .

The external circle depicts the first level ACE2 interactors; the internal circle depicts the second level of interactors, with genes which do not connect directly with ACE2. For clarity, we showed only the edges associated with virus-related proteins (gene id in red). Edges associated with virus-related proteins are shown in red for first-level (direct) and in grey for the second--level (indirect) ACE2 interactors. Inset in the top right depicts the additional information for each gene/protein, as associated processes (blue letters), associated diseases (color-label ring) and expression confidence across key tissues (black bars). Inset in the bottom right depict the same network including all edges. Notice that the closest ACE2 interactors are REN and INS, which play a central role in the pathophysiology of a number of cardiovascular disorders. The following interactor is KNG1, essential for blood coagulation and assembly of the kallikrein-kinin system. In the network are present 11 virus-infection related proteins forming a dense connection with ACE2 and its top interactors which can affect its functionality.

Those pathways included RAS, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, innate immune system, neutrophil degranulation and intrinsic pathway of clot formation. Moreover, signaling pathways identified as specific for the heart-relevant ACE2 interaction network were associated with adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, FOXO2 signaling pathway, relaxin signaling pathway, platelet degranulation and VEGFR2 mediated vascular permeability. In these networks, the closest interactors of ACE2 were REN, INS, KNG1, and AGT. Those results were supported by our subsequent analysis showing that genes from the ACE2 network have strongest connection with rare diseases related to high blood pressure, respiratory diseases (i.e. SARS and Goodpasture syndrome), renal diseases, coagulation disorders and several phenotypes like obesity, hypertension, DM that are known to be a risk factors for severe course of COVID-19.

            "text": "Moreover, in our in silico analysis using ACE2 functional networks, we found that RAS/ACE2, AGE-RAGE, and Apelin signaling pathways play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These pathways have a crucial role in pathogenesis of DM, CVD and blood pressure regulations. Therefore, binding of the SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor leading to disturbances in the pathways of these key regulators might explain the adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients with coexistence of CVD. Abnormalities of ACE2/RAS pathway signaling and deregulation of angiotensin II as a fundamental mediator of this axis are closely related to pathophysiology of hypertension and progression of cardiovascular remodeling. 35 Furthermore, increased ACE2 expression attenuates hypertension-linked pathophysiological changes and protects against elevated blood pressure whereas loss of ACE2 function exacerbates hypertension. 36 Apelin signaling is involved in many physiological processes such as energy metabolism, blood pressure regulation, and cardiac contractility and plays an important role in organ and tissue pathologies including, DM, obesity, HF as well as HIV-1 infection. 37 In vitro analysis showed that apelin is a second catalytic substrate for ACE2 and it can effect as an inotropic and cardioprotective peptide. 38, 39 Thromboembolic complications in COVID-19: the role of KNG1, one of the top ACE2 interactors. In this study we found a strong connection between ACE2 and KNG1 which as a part of Kalikrein-Kinin system (KKS) encoding precursors of kinins. 40 KKS mediators are involved in vessel wall remodeling, intimal hyperplasia 41 and affect nitric oxide and prostacyclin production. 42 Moreover, high molecular weight kininogen (HK) is essential in surface-binding and activity of factor XI, a component of intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. 43 Plasma kininogen may induce the development of arterial thrombosis, especially under pathologic conditions. 44 2-chain HKa was also found to inhibit PAI-1 function, interfere with platelet activation and mediate platelet-leukocyte interaction 45, 46 and therefore, deregulation of KKS may result in thromboembolic complications and lead to sepsis exacerbation in infections. [47] [48] [49] Pro-inflammatory cytokines modulated by ACE2, a putative mechanism for generalized inflammatory response. Several experimental studies indicated that ACE2 is able to modify acute and chronic inflammatory response. 50, 51 In line, we found in our analysis a strong interaction of ACE2 with several genes related with inflammatory response including CCL2 and TGFB1. Loss of function of ACE2 in mutant mice resulted in enhanced production of inflammatory cytokine and collagenase levels, increased ROS, neutrophilic infiltration and MAPK activation. 52 Diminished ACE2 function may deregulate RAS and induce inflammation and vessel permeability and lung edema. 53 It is worth to mention that among SARS-CoV-infected patients the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially CCL2 and TGF-\u03b21 were increased in cells expressing ACE2, while this could not be seen in tissue with undetectable ACE2 expression 54 A comparable pattern of inflammatory cytokines was found in SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. 55 The role of virus-infection related proteins from ACE2 network in COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Additional analysis of ACE2 interaction network identified 11 virus-infection related proteins involved in significantly enriched pathways. Three of them (ACE2, CLEC4M and TMPRSS2) directly interact with virus glycoprotein S. We identified 10 virus-infection related proteins in the heart-specific interaction network, (except for TMPRSS2) suggesting that the heart tissue could be capable of being as strongly affected as the respiratory system. Three of those genes: DPP4, CCL2 and ANPEP showed especially extensive connections with top regulators of the network. Interestingly, higher plasma DPP4 can be found among patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome and DM, who are at risk of a severe course of COVID-19. 56 Moreover, in experimental models of ARDS, DPP4 inhibitors suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production and attenuated LPS-induced lung injury. 57 DPP4 knockin mice were found more susceptible to MERS-CoV infections which resulted in severe inflammatory response and lethal lung disease. 58, 59 Therefore, it should be further investigated whether DPP4 inhibitors, widely used for the treatment of DM, may act as therapeutic drugs for ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. 60 Interestingly, DPP4 inhibitors are able to at least partially reverse the olfactory dysfunction observed in DM, suggesting that DPP4 pathway may be involved in anosmia which occurs commonly among COVID-19 patients. 61, 62 This evidence show that DPP4 could be a crucial factor in regulation of multiple pathological processes associated with COVID-19.",

MiR-1305 and miR-587 were found to regulate the expression of TGF-\u03b2 pathway members, SMAD3 and SMAD4. 70, 71 SMAD3 negatively regulates the inflammatory response and modulates T-cell activation. 72 The TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway has been directly related to viral infections. 73 Moreover, this pathway deregulation has been also implicated to ventricular remodeling, myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy and, as a result, HF progression. 74 The highest expression of miR-587 was found in platelets of patients with acute coronary syndrome and was closely related to the severity of coronary artery stenosis. 75 miR-26b-5p: anti-fibrotic agent and AGTR1-dependent hypertension modulator. In our study we found that miR-26b-5p may play an important role in pathogenesis of HF in COVID-19 patients as showed by an interaction of ACE2 with ENPEP, AGT, CCN2, CALM1, CCL2, and AGTR1. Noteworthy, previous study showed that in the miRNA-differentially expressed genes (DEG) regulatory network, hsa-miR-26b-5p was one of the most important miRNA and AGTR1 was the most outstanding up-regulated DEGs in the PPI network. 76 It has been suggested that AGTR1 can modulate hypertension, via the regulation of miR-26b-5p in arachidonic acid metabolism. The anti-fibrotic effect of miR-26b-5p was shown in the liver, in the diabetic mouse myocardium and in Ang-II-induced mouse cardiac fibroblasts . 77 miR-302c-5p: potential antiviral therapeutic and biomarker of HF. Another regulating miRNA from our network was miR-302c-5p playing an important role in many viral infections. [78] [79] [80] A study reported an association between the miR-302, KPNA2 axis and EV71-related cytokine storm and showed the potential of miR-302 as an antiviral therapeutic. 80 Our bioinformatic analysis for the first time showed the importance of miR-302c-5p in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Apart from the crucial function of miR-302 in viral infections, it may be also associated with CVD, 81,82 as circulating miR-302 was positively correlated with NT-proBNP levels in acute HF patients and showed strong potential as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and the differentiation of disease severity of acute HF. 81 miR-27a-3p: a potential biomarker of acute HF and NF-\u03baB signaling regulator. Also miR-27a-3p was found to be involved in inflammatory response and oxidative stress through several pathways including PPAR-\u03b3, NF-\u03baB and PI3K/ AKT/Nrf2 signaling. [83] [84] [85] In animal model of acute lung injury, expression of miR-27a-3p in alveolar macrophages was significantly decreased, while overexpression of miR-27a-3p suppressed NF-\u03baB activation and alleviated acute lung injury by binding to its target NFKB1. 83 Moreover, it was also found that miR-27a-3p may target pathways related to atherosclerosis, and may act as a potential biomarker of acute HF. 86, 87 ",

(B) depicts the SARS-CoV-2/Human interactome as shown in previously published work 30. Nodes in the network A are sorted by number of connections with virus interactome. Nodes from the network B are sorted by the number of interactions with human proteins. Dark blue edges are showing connections between ACE2 network and virus protein S. Bright blue edges are showing second level interactors of virus glycoprotein S. Virus proteins are shown as orange octagons, while virus-infection related human proteins have red labels. Inset in the bottom right depict the same networks including all SARS-CoV-2/ Human interactome edges. Notice that ACE2 interaction network connects directly with virus protein S through ACE2, CLECAM4 and TMPRSS2. Also, SARS-CoV-2 interactome strongly connects with the ACE2 network through INS, CDK4, CCL2 and ALB, all of them associated with atherosclerosis processes.",
