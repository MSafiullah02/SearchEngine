The value of the ANC in clinical practice will be limited for several reasons. First, no cutoff ANC was identified that was both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of SARS. Second, in clinical practice, it will be necessary to distinguish not only between SARS and CAP but also between SARS and other causes of fever and respiratory symptoms, including influenza, other viral respiratory tract infections, and congestive heart failure.

First, serological confirmation of the diagnosis of SARS was not obtained for all patients. However, serological test results were positive for 97% of patients tested, and the results of the analysis did not differ when patients without serological results were excluded. Second, because the CAP database did not measure laboratory values over time, we were unable to examine trends in laboratory values after hospital admission. Therefore, it remains possible that greater differences between the laboratory values in patients with SARS, compared with patients with CAP, might occur later in the illness. However, laboratory tests performed late in the course of illness would not help in distinguishing cases of SARS from cases of CAP at the time of initial assessment, when decisions regarding hospital admission, isolation, and treatment must be made.

To determine the ability of 6 common hematological and biochemical tests, measured at hospital admission, to differentiate between patients with SARS and patients with CAP due to other causes, we compared the results from a database of SARS patients with those from a database of CAP patients. The SARS database contained information on 144 patients with SARS from the first phase of the Toronto SARS outbreak, which occurred from March through May 2003. A description of this database has been published previously[8]. Cases were identified by clinicians at all Toronto-area hospitals caring for \u044310 patients with SARS and were entered into the database if they met the 4 April 2003 CDC case definition for suspect or probable SARS. The definition for suspected SARS consisted of the presence of fever, respiratory symptoms, and an exposure history; the definition for probable SARS included suspected SARS plus abnormal chest radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia[1]. Ethics approval for this study was obtained through the research ethics boards at all participating hospitals and from the University of Toronto.The CAP database contained information for 8044 patients with CAP who presented to emergency departments at 7 hospitals in Edmonton, Canada, from 1 November 2000 through 31 October 2002.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Number of patients available for analysis before and after agematching.NOTE.
