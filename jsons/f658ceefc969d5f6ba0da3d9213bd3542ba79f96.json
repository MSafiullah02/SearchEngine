A recent study also showed that HRV was the most prevalent agent associated with severe bronchiolitis in a population of preterm infants [Miller et al., 2012] .",

            "text": "HRV is a small non-enveloped single-stranded RNA virus that is now classified within the genus Enterovirus belonging to the family Picornaviridae. Classical HRV consists of more than 100 distinct serotypes. Until recently, on the basis of gene sequence analysis, HRV was classified into three species, HRV-A, HRV-B, and the newly designated HRV-C [Lau et al., 2007; McErlean et al., 2007; Bizzintino et al., 2011] . Recent studies have suggested that the illness severity differs among HRV species [Khetsuriani et al., 2008; Calvo et al., 2010] and that HRV-C could be associated with more severe clinical illnesses, including wheezing, lower respiratory infections and asthmatic exacerbations, than HRV-A and HRV-B [Lau et al., 2007; Khetsuriani et al., 2008; Han et al., 2009; Lau et al., 2009; Linsuwanon et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009; Piralla et al., 2009; Bizzintino et al., 2011] . However, some reports have indicated that HRV-C has been detected in healthy individuals without any acute respiratory symptoms [Calvo et al., 2010] and that there is no difference between the clinical presentations of patients infected with the different HRV species [Iwane et al., 2011] . Therefore, the clinical significance of HRV-C remains controversial and needs to be addressed further.",

A similar detection rate was reported in Lanzhou, China (13.1%) [Jin et al., 2009 ]. However, the study rate is lower than 30% detection rate reported in a study of hospitalized pediatric patients diagnosed with acute lower respiratory illness in Thailand [Linsuwanon et al., 2009] and is also lower than the 29.7% detection rate found in a study of hospitalized children <18 years of age in Hong Kong [Lau et al., 2009] . The present study indicates that HRV-A (50.0%) and HRV-C (39.6%) may be more prevalent than HRV-B (10.4%). Similar results have been reported in Hong Kong, Italy, Thailand, and Jordan, where the percentages of HRV-C were 43.8%, 41.1%, 58%, and 26%, respectively [Lau et al., 2009; Linsuwanon et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009; Piralla et al., 2009] . This shows that HRV-C has been found in patients from various countries and plays an important role in respiratory tract infections worldwide. The HRV-positive ratio was highest (33.3%) in children <12 months of age in the Hong Kong study [Lau et al., 2009] . Similarly, 64% of the infected children were younger than 6 months in a study in Jordan [Miller et al., 2009 ]. In addition, in a study in Thailand, most HRV-positive specimens were from children 6 to 23 months of age [Linsuwanon et al., 2009] . In a 21-year study, HRV was more frequently detected in younger children and infants than in older children [Linder et al., 2013] . A recent case-control study found that both the HRV-A and HRV-C detection rates were significantly higher in young children hospitalized for acute respiratory illnesses than in asymptomatic controls [Iwane et al., 2011] . In the present study, 91.6% (185/202) of the HRV-positive individuals were 36 months old, and the highest infection rate was observed in children 13-36 months old (25.3%). Parents of younger children may take children to the doctor more often than parents of older children. In addition, only children hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection were included in the study. Further studies are necessary to determine why age is associated with HRV infections.",

One study suggested that HRV, including HRV-C, could be found throughout the year but that it predominates during the rainy season in the pediatric population in Thailand [Linsuwanon et al., 2009 ]. In Kenya, there was no clear seasonal pattern of occurrence for any species [Onyango et al., 2012] , while the number of HRV-C infections peaked in early winter (December) and late spring (April) in Lanzhou, China [Jin et al., 2009] .

In this study, HRV was detected throughout the year and peaked in the winter and spring, and the HRV-C prevalence peaked in early winter and late autumn.

In a recent study involving patients from Thailand, other respiratory viruses were co-detected in approximately 38% of the HRV-positive patients; of these patients, 40% were co-infected with HRV-C and 36% were infected with HRV/RSV [Linsuwanon et al., 2009] . RSV and HRV were the viruses identified most frequently in mixed infections in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis [Richard et al., 2008] . Of those with HRV in the present study, 53.0% were codetected with other respiratory viruses and 41.1% with HRV-C. RSV (47.7%) was the most common additional respiratory virus detected in the HRVpositive patients. These findings were in agreement with a report from Thailand. Children with HRV mono-infection versus HRV co-detection with other viruses had similar clinical courses, comparable to those in some US studies [Iwane et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2011] . One study suggested co-infections were not associated with a particular HRV species or with severity [Lauinger et al., 2013] . No significant differences in the clinical severity were found between patients with HRV single infection and those with HRV co-detections. No significant differences in median age, gender, symptomatology (fever, wheezing, cyanosis, and crackles), supplemental oxygen, and time hospitalized were observed between children infected with HRV-C only and those with HRV-C codetections.",

            "text": "Previous studies have suggested that HRV-C might play a role in severe clinical disease. HRV-C was present in the majority of children with acute asthma and was associated with more severe asthma [Bizzintino et al., 2011] . In another study by Miller et al. [2009] , children with HRV-C were more likely to require supplemental oxygen than those with HRV-A. Wheezing episodes were also more common among individuals with HRV-C and HRV-A infection than among those with HRV-B infection [Lau et al., 2009] . It was found that HRV-C was associated with respiratory infections with few symptoms and could trigger apparently life-threatening events in young infants [Calvo et al., 2009] . Another study suggested that HRV-C was associated with more severe disease in children <3 years of age [Lauinger et al., 2013] . However, some reports found no differences in the clinical characteristics among hospitalized enrolled patients positive for HRV-A, HRV-B, or HRV-C, including wheezing [Fry et al., 2011; Iwane et al., 2011] . In the present study, no significant differences were observed in clinical symptoms, signs, and clinical diagnoses including wheezing, supplemental oxygen and acute asthmatic bronchopneumonia among the three HRV genotypes. With the absence of a control group in both the current and previous studies, it is difficult to evaluate the exact role that HRV-C plays in acute lower respiratory tract infection.",
