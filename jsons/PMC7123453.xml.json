It is divided into two compartments by a nasal septum. Short, somewhat stiff, sensitive hairs, located at the nasal entrance, allow for enhanced tactile stimuli which can result in nasal itching and sneezing. The superior, middle, and inferior turbinates extend from the lateral walls of each side of the nose and occupy much of the free space within the nasal cavity. They overlie the superior, middle, and inferior nasal meatus, respectively, and can become edematous with various forms of rhinitis and rhinosinusitis and subsequently obstruct airflow [1, 2]. The middle meatus is important because it contains three convoluted and narrow ostiomeatal pathways which drain the anterior ethmoid, frontal, and maxillary sinuses.",

When aerosolized cat saliva andpelt proteins, sources of cat allergens, are inhaled, these allergens are absorbed onto mucosal surfaces, in this case, in the nose. Two IgE molecules located on a mast cell are bridged by the cat allergen, triggering the mast cell to release stored and newly generated vasoactive amines, such as histamine and proteases. They also generate and secrete products of arachidonic acid, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These mediators cause an inflammatory response, vascular dilation, increased vascular permeability, and the recruitment of eosinophils,neutrophils, and Th2 cells (Fig. 5.2a, b). They also cause smooth muscle contraction in the bronchi, responsible for the bronchial constriction in allergic asthma. This inflammatory cascade triggers the symptoms of allergic rhinitis which includes sneezing, nasal itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion; with asthma, this inflammation causes cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The inflammatoryprocess can ultimately damage the epithelial tissues of the nose, sinuses, and lung.",

Nonsedating second-generation antihistamines, such as cetirizine and loratadine, are considered safe and are first drugs of choice. Montelukast is also considered safe to use during pregnancy, but it is not very effective. For more persistent symptoms, an intranasal corticosteroid can be utilized [19, 21], such as mometasone, beclomethasone, fluticasone, and others. Although the safety of nasal decongestants, such as phenylephrine and oxymetazoline, has not been studied directly, they appear to be safe with short-term use (less than 3 days), particularly after the first trimester. However, oral decongestants have been associated with birth defects, when used in the first trimester [19] (Table 5.3).",

SCIT is more often prescribed when multiple allergens are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, i.e., allergy to tree, grass, and weed pollen, dust mites, cat, dog, and other allergens. SLIT is primarily employed when the number allergens towhich an individual is limited, e.g., only grass pollen, ragweed pollen, and/or dust mites. When given over time, such therapy induces clinical tolerance to the allergens to which an individual is allergic. Such therapy does not usually begin during pregnancy. Allergen immunotherapy, depending on the risk/benefit, can be continued or discontinued during pregnancy [22]. For SCIT, the dose of allergen vaccine and the interval between injections are usually halved to decrease the potential of inducing a systemic allergic reaction which can affect the welfare of the fetus and mother [23]. SLIT is similar to SCIT except that the allergen vaccine or tablet for SLIT is delivered under the tongue and absorbed locally, not by the subcutaneous route. Information about SLIT safety duringpregnancy is insufficient, but animal studies show no risk to the fetus. In general, allergen immunotherapy can be continued if tolerated before but should not be initiated during pregnancy [24].",

When these measures fail, intranasal corticosteroids, such as budesonide, can be administered, although intranasal fluticasone was not effective for pregnancy rhinitis in one study [28].

Symptomatic therapy includes elevating the head of the bed, avoiding irritants, and using intranasal saline. When such measures fail and symptoms persist, pharmacologic intervention can be considered. Intranasal ipratropium bromide is primarily used to treat excessive nasal secretion or rhinorrhea, which can occur both anteriorly and posteriorly, and is especially effective for gustatory rhinitis. Intranasal corticosteroids are the drugs of choice for eosinophilic nonallergic rhinitis (see below) and can be tried in other subjects with nonallergic rhinitis. Oral and topical antihistamines, such as azelastine, can also be considered, although their safety during pregnancy has not been studied. The topical antihistamine azelastine also is efficacious [7, 15, 42, 43], but has not been studied in human pregnancy. These are sometimes used along with the cautious use of nasal decongestants, which preferably should be avoided especially during the first trimester. Oxymetazoline drops or spray, with no more than one or two sprays in each nostril twice daily, ideally for no more than 3 days in a row, may be helpful in subjects with substantial nasal obstruction. Intranasal corticosteroids have been reported to protect against rhinitis medicamentosa [44, 45]; therefore, patientsshould be maintained on intranasal corticosteroids if oxymetazoline or its equivalent is used long term.",

Subjects with chronic sinusitis, particularly when associated with chronic infection, should be evaluated for a primary or secondary immunodeficiency and other predisposing illnesses such as cystic fibrosis, ciliary dysfunction, and anatomical abnormalities [3]. A referral to a competent allergist/immunologist is helpful for this purpose.CRS with Nasal Polyposis (CRS with NP)CRS with NP accounts for 20\u201333% of CRS and ischaracterized by the presence of nasal polyps usually emanating from the middle meatus, gradual worsening nasal congestion, a feeling of fullness and pressure in the face, anterior and posterior pharyngeal purulent drainage, and anosmia. Fever and facial discomfort are usually absent. Translucent, yellow-gray or white, and often glistening polyps are usually visible with anterior rhinoscopy.

Differentiating CRS without NP and RARS may be difficult. The formerhas persistent and the latter intermittent symptoms and signs. Symptoms and signs include facial fullness, discomfort or pain, anterior/posterior purulent change, and fatigue. An elevated temperature is rare. The pathophysiology of this disease is not completely understood [3, 66, 70].\nAllergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis\n Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) accounts for 5\u201310% of all CRS and is usually caused by the colonization of the mucosal membranes of the upper airway and sinuses with a noninvasive fungus, the most common of which is Aspergillus fumigatus, and a subsequent allergic response. Subjects with AFRS often have asthma, NP, and allergic rhinitis, and it occurs in immunocompetent subjects. The signs and symptoms are similar to that of CRS with NP. Subjects with AFRS,however, usually have a pathognomonic \u201cpeanut butter\u201d appearing mucus drainage from the nares or posteriorly into their oral pharynx [3, 66, 70].",

Systemic corticosteroids are sometimes indicated to decrease inflammation but usually only for a short period of time. Evidence-based medicine is lacking for most forms of treatment. Intranasal corticosteroids, such as budesonide, versus systemic corticosteroids are preferred especially during pregnancy. If indicated [65, 66, 70], an antibiotic regimen such as amoxicillin-clavulanate acid is usually the first drug of choice. Others include a macrolide, such as erythromycin, or clindamycin or metronidazole, although the latter medication is contraindicated in the first trimester. Other antibiotics to consider include cefuroxime, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, azithromycin, or TMP-SMX (in penicillin-allergic only) [2, 71]. Antifungals have not been proven to be helpful but are sometimes utilized; however,they have not been shown to be safe to use during pregnancy.",

The allergen is degraded into small amino acid chains and subsequently displayed on the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) for specific T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition. Once the specific TCR recognizes the processed allergen on MHC II, a series of events occur leading to T-cell activation. Activated T cells interact with specific B cells and become activated. Activated B cells, with the help of interleukin 4 (IL-4), undergo immunoglobulin class switching. Class-switched B cells become plasma cells and begin producing immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to the allergen. Secreted IgE coat mast cells. (b) Upon re-exposure to an identical allergen, IgE attaches to mast cells via high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc\u03b5RI) and recognizes the allergen, which cross-links IgE molecules. This cross-linking leads to mast cell degranulation and the secretion of stored and newly formed inflammatory mediators, e.g., histamine, heparin, prostaglandins (PGs), and various cytokines. These mediators are responsible for the early- and late-phase signs and symptoms of IgE-mediated allergic diseases",
