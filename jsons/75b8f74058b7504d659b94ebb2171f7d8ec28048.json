Antibody prevalence was generally high in the age group 0-6 months indicative of maternal antibody. This, however, decreased in the next age group, 7-12 months for all the viruses except adenoviruses. After the first year of life, there was a general increase in prevalence of complement fixing antibodies with increase in age for adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, para-influenza viruses and coronaviruses. This, however, was not the case for influenza A and B viruses where prevalence of complement fixing antibody was approximately the same between 1-12 years of age. The prevalence of complement fixing antibodies to reoviruses in these children was generally low. However, after depletion of maternal antibody there was an increase in prevalence between ages 1-3 years after which it decreased with increase in age up to 12 years. These results are shown in Fig. 1 .",

This might account for the drastic difference in adenovirus infections. Similarly, our result for the prevalence of influenza A and B of 47 and 41 per cent, respectively, is in contrast with the work of Ogunbi 1 ' in Lagos which shows only a prevalence of 6 per cent for these viruses. The results obtained in Zaria 8 a town near Jos in northern Nigeria, showing a prevalence of 23 per cent for influenza viruses also differs from that obtained in Lagos.",

This coroborates most of the work done in developed countries showing that these viruses are the most frequent viral agents associated with respiratory tract infections of children. 10 ' 15 We have also shown for the first time that coronaviruses may also be involved in childhood infections in Nigeria. However, much more long-term studies need to be carried out to fully elucidate the role of all these viruses in ARI of children in Nigeria.",
