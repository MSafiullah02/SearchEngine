A virus species, as defined by van Regenmortel, is \u201ca polythetic class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecologic niche.\u201d19\nPolythetic refers to the fact that viruses grouped within a species share many properties. Species criteria may include genetic structure, sequence homology, host range, tissue tropism, biologic reservoir, route of transmission, immunologic cross-reactivity, epidemiology, and pathogenicity.20 With the advent of rapid nucleic acid sequencing, sequence homology has taken precedence over other species classification criteria.21\n",
