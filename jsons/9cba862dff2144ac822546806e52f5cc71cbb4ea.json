These tests are often performed by non-laboratory trained staff. At the present time there are no external quality assessment (EQA) providers in the UK offering proficiency testing schemes for HIV point of care testing. The aim of this study is to develop such an EQA scheme. Firstly, a selection of the most widely used POCTs was selected and their performance assessed using existing HIV-positive serology EQA specimens. All assays produced the correct results however intensity of results observed for the same specimen differed greatly between POCT devices. In addition the effect of various sub-groups of HIV-1 serum samples on the HIV POCT assays was investigated and no difference between the results on the POCTs was observed. Ultimately four serum specimens, two HIV-1 and one HIV-2 positive, one HIV negative, were chosen and sent to NHS laboratories and sexual health clinics for testing as part of a pilot EQA scheme for HIV POCT. Results were excellent with 97% of participants reporting correct results (n \u00bc 20). The study highlighted a lack of awareness of EQA particularly in nonlaboratory settings, although recommendations (ISO 22870:2006) are in place for the users of such devices.

This obviously has a severe impact on the risk of HIV transmission. It has been shown in several studies such as that by Darnell One of the priority areas for the UNAIDS framework for 2009-2011 is to reduce the transmission of HIV. Testing for HIV at the point of care may increase the number of adults willing to take a test as the results are produced at the same time as testing. This would therefore reduce the risk of transmission and allow anti-viral treatment to start earlier. 3 Point of care tests (POCTs) are investigations carried out near to or at the patient's side. They are rapid immunochromatographic, flow through or particle agglutination assays that provide results immediately or within minutes depending on the test device. Only a small volume of patient sample is required to perform the test, often a drop of blood from a finger prick. 4 The sample formats for use in POCTs vary between devices but can be serum, plasma, whole blood or saliva.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 267, "text": "Darnell", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 624, "end": 625, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 998, "end": 999, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The majority of POCT devices approved for diagnostic use involve HIV-recombinant antigens and/or synthetic peptides bound to the membrane in the POCT device, the sample is applied to the membrane and if antibodies are present they form a complex with the membrane-bound antigen that induces a coloured reaction.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In addition to the detection of HIV antibodies, new fourth-generation POCTs can also detect the presence of HIV p24 antigen; antibodies to p24 antigen are membrane bound and detect p24 antigen in the sample. These tests reduce the time to diagnosis as HIV infection can be detected before seroconversion. 5 Studies show that the use of POCTs for the detection of HIV is increasing rapidly in both laboratory and other clinical settings, especially in developing countries. For example, following the introduction of POCTs in Malawi the number of people receiving an HIV test annually rose from 5000 to 40 000 and the number of those tested who remained to receive results increased from 69% to 99.7%. 4 HIV POCTs are often performed by non-laboratory trained individuals such as nurses. 6 The results of these tests are interpreted by the user, which is very subjective and relies heavily on user expertise and knowledge of the test principle. 4 Adequate training and quality assurance procedures should be in place, as with any other assay, to ensure reliable results. 7 External quality assessment (EQA) has an important role in the quality assurance measures of every laboratory or clinic as participation in an EQA scheme allows the user to monitor their own quality assurance procedures and to readily identify and remedy any problems with internal quality control measures. It demonstrates to patients and other professionals a commitment to quality. 8 Participating in an EQA scheme contributes to a laboratory's accreditation status awarded by the appropriate governing body, for instance the Clinical Pathology Accreditation.

It was anticipated that the use of Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo will increase as at the time of the study it was already employed by 24% of the participants. It was recommended that p24-antigen-positive material is sourced for future investigations. It may prove difficult to source antigen-positive material as blood would need to be donated from recently infected individuals before seroconversion has occurred or from patients who have progressed to late stage AIDS when levels of p24 antigen increase as antibody levels diminish. It may also be possible to spike existing UK NEQAS specimens with p24 antigen as recombinant p24 antigen is commercially available. However, this may also prove to be difficult in practice as antibodies present in the serum sample would form complexes with p24 antigen upon addition rendering it undetectable by the POCTs. Participant performance in this pilot scheme was excellent. Constructive feedback was received from those who participated, although overall there was a lack of awareness of EQA schemes within sexual health clinics and the role the schemes had in this setting. It became apparent that, in most cases, the clinics had never encountered, or even heard of EQA before and were unaware how this type of assessment would benefit them. Upon explaining the purpose and benefits of EQA, more interest was shown and participating clinic numbers rose from 3 to 10. Personally contacting the clinics was a very time-consuming process as it proved difficult to make contact with the appropriate people especially when some clinics were only open once or twice a week. In some cases those contacted were unaware of who would give consent for participation and were unwilling to help any further. Often telephone messages and follow-up emails were left unanswered. It was accepted that a lack of awareness of EQA was the main reason for the low number of participating sexual health clinics however correspondence with those who chose not to participate also highlighted other reasons for not participating. Cost implications were a concern for those clinics operating as charities, even though the pilot was free of charge they had to take into account the costs of kits involved in testing. Some clinics were interested in the scheme but did not participate due to lack of staff and time as certain clinics only operate 1 or 2 days a week they felt EQA was another burden on their heavy workload. In a minority of cases, a general lack of interest in EQA was encountered where the clinics in question felt that their own internal quality assurance measures were sufficient. For future pilot studies, it is recommended that further promotion of the scheme be carried out at the local and management level. It would be important to target higher management levels of primary care trusts, charities and organizations involved in sexual health such as the Terrence Higgins Trust or the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV to further promote the benefits of EQA and make them aware of the recommendations from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and from the International Organization for Standardization.

However, it does have a wider use and so it is important that an EQA provider identifies the users of POCTs and how they are used in all types of settings. For example, it is not necessary to perform these tests in a laboratory and so testing can be encountered in settings such as sexual health clinics, in developing countries where charitable organizations visit remote villages and test the whole population or in hospitals or healthcare settings in cases of accidental exposure. It is possible that these tests are performed due to ease of use rather than as a point of care or rapid test and it is often the case that the patients sample is referred to a laboratory for confirmatory testing, which delays the result for the patient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the UK there are now recommendations for HIV POCTs to be used for screening in many settings.
