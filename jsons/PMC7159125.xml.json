            "text": "Hypertension has an important role in the development and progression of kidney disease. The RAS is key regulator of blood pressure, both in health and disease. For example, Ang II acts to increase systemic blood pressure levels through a number of mechanisms, including direct vasoconstriction, the stimulation of vasopressin release and the enhancement of aldosterone production leading to renal salt and water retention. To the extent that ACE2 reduces the local concentration of Ang II, by hydrolysing this constrictor peptide to Ang 1\u20137, ACE2 is able to indirectly antagonize these pro\u2010hypertensive processes. Furthermore, as noted above, Ang 1\u20137 generated by ACE2 is a vasodilatory peptide, with actions on blood pressure that act as a counterbalance to the effects of Ang II. For example, Ang 1\u20137 also stimulates the production of nitric oxide\n47\n and vasodilator prostaglandins\n48\n, \n49\n and potentiates bradykinin synthesis\n22\n and activity of bradykinin at the B2 receptor.\n50\n, \n51\n However, the importance of Ang 1\u20137 in normal physiology and particularly in blood pressure control, is unclear, as both Ang 1\u20137 and Ang 1\u20137\u2010mimetic compounds fail to lower systemic blood pressure levels in healthy individuals. This contrasts strikingly with disease states, such as diabetes, hypertension or volume overload. In these conditions, where the RAS is activated, Ang 1\u20137 has potent antihypertensive actions.\n52\n The potential importance of Ang 1\u20137 to the management of hypertension is further illustrated by the finding that the vasodilatory effects of both ACE inhibition and blockade of the AT1 receptor in experimental animals are attenuated by depletion of Ang 1\u20137.\n53\n\n",

However, blood pressure levels in ACE2 KO mice are normal or only mildly elevated\n55\n despite increased Ang II plasma and tissue levels. The unaltered blood pressure is not explained by any compensatory changes in ACE, as blood pressures in the ace/ace2 double null mice were similar to that of ace single mutant mice.\n31\n It is possible that other homeostatic mechanisms, such as the apelin system or nitric oxide metabolism, are able to compensate in utero for loss of ACE2, thereby resulting in normal foetal development and basal blood pressure levels in the ACE2 knockout mice. An alternative hypothesis is that ACE2, like Ang 1\u20137 confers an antihypertensive action only when the RAS is activated. For example, ACE2 KO mice demonstrate a heightened hypertensive response to Ang II infusion, above that observed in wild type controls.\n55\n ACE2 expression levels are lower in the kidneys of salt\u2010sensitive Sabra hypertensive rats when compared with normotensive salt\u2010resistant Sabra normotensive rats. Furthermore, the additional increase in blood pressure that follows treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate in salt\u2010sensitive rats was also correlated with a further decrease in ACE2 protein expression.\n31\n In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), where the intrarenal and systemic RAS are also activated, ACE2 also plays an important role in blood pressure regulation.\n40\n For example, ACE2 was significantly reduced in hypertensive SHR, but when ACE2 expression was restored with all\u2010trans retinoic acid\n56\n or a lentiviral vector containing ACE2,\n57\n there was a significant attenuation in hypertension in these animals. It is also interesting to note that in this model at birth, when SHR rats are still normotensive, the renal expression and activity of ACE2 was significantly increased when compared with normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats assessed at the same time point.\n40\n This further supports the notion that renal ACE2 is a compensatory mechanism, which can offset stimuli that promote hypertension, but ultimately the loss of ACE2 expression in the SHR leads to the full manifestation of its phenotype with the development of adult\u2010onset hypertension.",
