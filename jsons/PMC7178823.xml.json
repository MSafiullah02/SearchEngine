Such decisions may have social and political consequences: the former will impact the community directly and the latter will ensure that political attention is focussed on the area. Both may be used to justify the collection of community views with respect to allocation of scarce resources in a pandemic. However, some might argue that allocation of scarce resources in this scenario should be based solely on expert evaluation of evidence. That is, evidence should be used to prioritise the needs of sub-groups in the population and to evaluate the efficacy of specific health resources in addressing those needs. The objectives in resource allocation in a pandemic might include (i) maximising community benefit, (ii) equitable allocation of resources, (iii) protection of vulnerable groups, and (iv) fulfilment of obligations for reciprocity towards those who might put themselves at risk to provide care. Examining these objectives, it appears likely that interpretations of benefit, equity and the bounds of reciprocity will differ across the citizenry and that it will be important to consider community opinion and values in making these decisions.",

However, community views might be elicited for other reasons such as to support democratic or process oriented goals (Abelson et al. 2007). This orientation, which values citizen involvement in decision-making for its own sake, emerges from a number of areas including deliberative democratic theory (Smith and Wales 2000), the rise of literate active citizen groups and the increased demands for public accountability for public funding. In this case the focus is on democratic decision-making, fair and transparent process and participant empowerment. Alternatively capacity building goals (Abelson et al. 2007) may focus attention on improving community health literacy and enhancing the ability for citizens to engage in debate in areas of complex health policy.",

            "text": "Surveys are a widely used method for meeting instrumental goals: to elicit public views to inform policy decision-making or to provide public commentary or response on past decisions. A legitimate concern in gauging community views in this way is that the level of knowledge in the community about some of the more complex areas of healthcare planning and policy may be low. This may be particularly the case with emerging health technologies, new health threats or complex health policy areas. This methodological weakness may also apply to qualitative methods such as focus groups or interviews. The concern is that the community perspective, accessed through any of these methods, prior to a projected health emergency such as a pandemic, or before a new technology is rolled out, may change when the emergency occurs or technology is used and there is more interest in and access to information. In addition, policymakers might question the validity of citizen-driven decisions when the citizens have limited access to information to adequately inform those decisions. For this reason, deliberative process has been proposed as an anticipatory tool which can gauge the views of the community in policy areas that may generate future issues but where there is little current public debate (Warren 2009). Deliberative methods involve prolonged engagement with community members and provision of detailed information which the participants may draw upon in their decision-making. However, these methods also suffer from drawbacks, in particular with respect to how representative the views presented in small forums are of the population at large. These issues may limit the acceptability of deliberative methods to policymakers seeking to use community views to inform policy decisions.",

Very few studies compare different methods for gauging public perspectives on a single issue. This chapter uses a case study to examine the relationship between the choice of goals and methods and the resultant outcomes. We compared community views in South Australia on the allocation of scarce resources in a pandemic using two different methods: first, a cross-sectional survey of nearly 2000 citizens using computer assisted telephone interviews; and second a deliberative inclusive forum which used stratified random sampling to select a small number of citizens. The first method offered a snapshot of community views in a policy area which, at the time before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, was not topical and on which the general public was not well informed. The second method allowed for engagement with citizens in an informed deliberative process, also prior to the 2009 pandemic.",

This causes a rapid spread of the virus to people around the world and has the potential to cause large numbers of deaths and serious illness.\nNo other information was provided.

That is, the data collection in both cases occurred early in the decision-making process at a \u2018stage when value judgments might be important\u2019 (Rowe and Frewer 2000, 14). This may influence the response in that survey participants may perceive the question to be of little interest and not applicable personally to them. Such a response may change if the question was asked during a severe pandemic. In contrast, in the deliberative forum the participants were guided through the events which would unfold in a pandemic and therefore were more immersed in the scenario. It is still possible that they did not perceive that they would be personally affected but it is much less likely and the responses from the participants in the forum suggested that they did see themselves to be at risk. For example, participants in discussing whether scarce antiviral drugs should be reserved for essential services, related their judgment back to their own personal risk in the circumstances.\nParticipant 1: Not so much. I wouldn\u2019t pick the essential services people because they are at risk, I would pick them because without power, water what have you, society wouldn\u2019t function.\nParticipant 2: We would be at more risk.

Thus, if the methods adopted with the forum were used in a publicity campaign aimed at the general population, then public acceptance of the allocation choices would possibly be similar.

The peer review process does permit explicit judgment of independence and validity and in this context both methods could be considered to have high transparency.

Some members of the team approached the project from a constructivist framework with capacity building and/or democratic empowerment goals foremost whereas some worked from a positivist framework and focussed solely on instrumental goals.

Both the survey and the forum fulfil the objective of community consultation but provide different information about community perspectives. This clear difference in outcomes raises concerns about the danger in policy development of \u2018cherry-picking\u2019 preferred results through the selection of methods which will provide those results.",

This may impact on the quality of the decision-making. Similarly some information will be dependent on the nature of the pandemic virus and therefore information can never be complete in a pre-pandemic period and as has been shown with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, uncertainty may persist well into the pandemic period (Roxon 2009).",

Deliberative forums potentially provide higher quality information about decision-making but may struggle for acceptance by policymakers and politicians because of the small number of participants, with concerns about generalisability of the results. Our work would support the contention of Rowe and Frewer (2000) that a combination of several methods with different strengths can provide a more complete picture of community views and therefore a solid base on which to build effective policy.",
