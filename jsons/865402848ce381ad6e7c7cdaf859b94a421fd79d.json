The purpose of these studies was to determine the source of the virus-induced oxidative stress. Inhibition of viral replication with antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 had no effect on virus-induced oxidative stress or interleukin-8 (IL-8) response ( vs. pg/mL in control cells). Treatment of cells with diphenylene iodonium 597 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 88 668 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 78 inhibited virus-induced oxidative stress and IL-8 elaboration, but allopurinol, ibuprofen, and rotenone had no effect. Studies in cell lines produced from a patient with gp91-phox deficiency revealed normal responses. In contrast, the oxidative response was decreased and the IL-8 concentration was pg/mL in cells from a patient with p47-phox deficiency, compared 227 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 36 with pg/mL in control cells. These studies suggest that the stimulation of reactive 664 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 48 oxygen species by viral challenge occurs at the cell surface even in the absence of viral replication and involves a flavoprotein that may act in concert with p47-phox.",

            "text": "The cellular mechanisms involved in the elaboration of IL-8 in response to viral challenge appears to involve oxidative stress-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB [6, 7] . Oxidative stress may occur in a cell either by inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities or by increased production of oxidants. The superoxide dismutases detoxify superoxide (O 2 \u03ea ) to hydrogen peroxide, which in turn is detoxified by catalase and glutathione peroxidase. The activities of superoxide dismutases, catalase, or glutathione peroxidase are not inhibited by rhi-novirus infection, suggesting that oxidative stress is a result of increased production of pro-oxidants [8] . Both reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species are pro-oxidants, and an increase in either of these species would potentially result in cellular oxidative stress. Reactive nitrogen species are generated by the action of nitric oxide synthase on L-arginine to produce reactive nitric oxide (NO). Although there are conflicting reports [9] , studies in our laboratory find no evidence that NO plays a role in rhinovirus infection or rhinovirus-induced IL-8 elaboration either in vitro or in vivo [10] . In contrast, rhinovirus challenge of fibroblasts or respiratory epithelial cells results in increased concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in the supernatant medium. These observations suggest that cellular oxidative stress in response to rhinovirus infection is due to an increased production of reactive oxygen species.",

This variant strain replicated normally, as assessed by cytopathic effect and quantitative viral cultures, compared with the wildtype virus. After 48 h of incubation, virus titers in the supernatant medium from MRC-5 cells infected with wild-type virus were TCID 50 /mL, compared with TCID 50 / 2.8 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 0. 4 2.4 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 0.5 mL in medium from cells infected with the variant strain. The variant strain was neutralized by type-specific antiserum to RV39, and replication was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with anti-ICAM antibody (data not shown). The variant strain of rhinovirus did not induce oxidative stress in MRC-5 cells, as determined by hydrogen peroxide production. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations in supernatant medium from control and rhinovirus-challenged MRC-5 cells were and 1.18 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 0.43 mM, respectively, whereas the supernatant from 5.3 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 1.4 MRC-5 cells challenged with RV39vs contained mM 0.89 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 0.18 H 2 O 2 . Similarly, the RV39vs did not produce oxidative stress in BEAS-2B cells, as determined by NBT dye reduction or by fluorescence staining of carbonyl groups (data not shown). In contrast to wild-type RV39, challenge of cells with this virus in vitro was not associated with activation of NF-kB (data not shown) or with IL-8 elaboration in either MRC-5 cells or BEAS-2B cells (figure 2). Challenge of MRC-5 cells with wildtype RV39 and RV39vs simultaneously resulted in IL-8 levels comparable to those seen after challenge with RV39 alone, suggesting that the RV39vs was not inhibiting cellular elaboration of IL-8. The observations that inhibition of viral replication with anti-ICAM antibody does not affect IL-8 elaboration and that the variant strain replicates normally but does not produce an IL-8 response suggest that virus-induced oxidative stress and IL-8 elaboration are independent of attachment to ICAM-1 or viral replication. In contrast to the effect of pretreatment of cells with DPI, inhibitors of other cellular sources of reactive oxygen species had no effect. Treatment of cells with ibuprofen, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, allopurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, or rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial superoxide generation, had no effect on either IL-8 elaboration or viral replication ( figure 4) .",

Previous studies had suggested that prevention of rhinovirus replication by blockade of attachment to ICAM-1 or UV inactivation of virus prevented virus-associated IL-8 elaboration [14] . These previous studies differed from our studies in that IL-8 elaboration was measured 24 h after challenge of the cell monolayer with a relatively low inoculum of virus. Under these conditions, virus-cell interaction by progeny virus produced as a result of viral replication presumably makes a substantial contribution to the IL-8 detected in the supernatant. Thus, inhibition of viral replication that eliminates this amplification would cause a corresponding reduction in IL-8 concentration. In our study, the effect of this amplification was eliminated by measurement of IL-8 in supernatants collected only 6 h after challenge of the monolayer with a large inoculum of virus. Our observations that a variant strain of RV39 replicates normally in fibroblast and BEAS-2B cells but does not cause oxidative stress or IL-8 elaboration is further evidence that viral attachment to ICAM-1 and subsequent replication events are not required for these processes.",

Treatment of the cells with Mn-TBAP, which mimics the activity of superoxide dismutase, inhibited oxidative stress and IL-8 elaboration in response to viral challenge but had no effect on viral replication. These observations suggest that the inhibition of viral replication by DPI was not a result of the inhibition of oxidative stress. Similar effects of DPI on virus-induced IL-8 elaboration and viral replication were seen after challenge of fibroblasts with either RSV or coronavirus 229E. RSV challenge in the presence of DPI (40 mM) resulted in an IL-8 concentration and virus titer in supernatant medium of pg/mL and 74 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 10 0.85 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 0.09 TCID 50 /mL, respectively, compared with pg/mL 1139 \u202b\u05e2\u202c 118 and TCID 50 /mL in control cells.
