Preferred terms for tracheal infections are (with the usual terms in parentheses): croup, supraglottitis (epiglottitis), and suppurative tracheitis, laryngotracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, or laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis (bacterial tracheitis), depending on the extent of the bacterial superinfection [ 6 ] .",

Of interest, the overall number of hospitalizations has continued to decrease in the last 20 years, given the improvement in diagnosis and treatment. Marx et al. [ 10 ] from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) studied the overall burden of croup and showed that the mean annual number of croup hospitalizations is about 41,000 (range, 27,000-62,000/year) in the U.S. Ninety-one percent of hospitalizations occur among children <5 years of age.

Both bacteria and viruses may be responsible for infections with collateral components, such as laryngotracheobronchitis, and the more general laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. In 1958, the fi rst evidence for association between croup and two newly isolated myxoviruses, parainfl uenza virus types 1 and 2, resulted in separation of two categories of cases-mild, requiring only outpatient follow up, and severe, requiring hospitalization [ 12 ] . Parainfl uenza is a RNA paramyxovirus that actively replicates in respiratory epithelial cells and is comprised of four major serotypes. Parainfl uenza type 3, more commonly associated with bronchiolitis or bronchopneumonia, can also produce severe croup in an endemic pattern, while type 4 is rarely seen. Parainfl uenza 1 and 2, account for >65 % of all causes of croup. A large series studied 6165 instances of lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) wherein approximately 75 % of all isolates were identifi ed as parainfl uenza viruses. Of these, parainfl uenza type 1 accounted for about 60 %. Conversely, the propensity of the various organisms to produce symptoms of croup reached 60 % for both parainfl uenza 1 and 2. For parainfl uenza type 3, the number dropped to about 30 %, whereas all the other microorganisms accounted for about 5-15 %. Thus, parainfl uenza viruses were the most common cause for all age groups; whereas respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) caused croup in infants and the infl uenza viruses and M. pneumoniae were signifi cant causes of croup only in children older than 5 years of age. Summertime croup may be due to enteroviruses, adenovirus, or parainfl uenza type 3.",

Prematurity is associated with an increased risk for mortality, with factors such as a decrease in gestational age, increased perinatal oxygen requirements and discharge within 3 months of the RSV season increasing the likelihood for hospitalization [ 14 ] . Among the rare viral causes, measles, by virtue of immunosuppression, leads to a bacterial superinfection that results in a condition termed measles-associated bacterial tracheitis (MABT) , which carries an increased risk for need of artifi cial airway and intensive care admission [ 15 ] .",

Recent studies have, however, shown that the benefi ts offered by mist treatment may be overemphasized. Three separate studies, that did not include untreated controls, determined that the effi cacy of aerosolized mist may not be proportional to the degree of mist saturation, for e.g. the effects of humidity at three different levels (100 %, 40 % and 33 %) remained the same [ 46 ] .

Early studies showed immediate clinical benefi t with use of 2.25 % racemic epinephrine, and the more recent studies demonstrated the same amount of benefi t for L-epinephrine at a ratio of 1:1000 used with 5 mL saline [ 53 ] . Initial studies represented a major paradigm shift in management of children with severe croup, obviating the need for endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy [ 54 ] . The therapeutic effects of epinephrine are mediated via \u03b1-adrenergic receptors that results in constriction of capillary arterioles and reduced infl ammation. Unfortunately, although the effects are almost immediate, they only last approximately 2 h, and hence the child should be watched for a reasonable period of time prior to discharge. This therapy may be suitable even in the outpatient setting if the observation period is adequate, although lack of improvement at about an hour following treatment may convert an outpatient encounter to hospitalization [ 55 ] . When conditions such as tetralogy of Fallot, tachycardia or ventricular outlet obstruction co-exist, epinephrine should be used cautiously [ 23 ] . With the peak effect occurring between 30 and 60 min, the child should be carefully monitored for the rebound effect-which usually occurs 3 h after treatment. The recommended dose is thus 2.25 % (0.25 mL in 3.75 mL of saline) for children <6 months of age and 0.5 mL for infants and children >6 months. Substituting isotonic with hypertonic saline (3 %) may enhance the effect by absorbing water from the submucosa.",

Empiric therapy with coverage that includes S. aureus , S. pyogenes , S. pneumoniae and H. infl uenzae is indicated. In an era when both hospital-acquired and communityacquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are prevalent, the combination of vancomycin and a third generation cephalosporin (such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) is a reasonable choice until identifi cation and susceptibility of the causative organism is established. In an intubated patient, tracheal aspirates should be obtained. A very useful adjunct to anti-microbial therapy is the use of frequent pulmonary toilet and debridement of tracheal pseudomembranes under bronchoscopic guidance [ 59 ] . In the presence of other co-morbidities such as immunosuppression, mortality increases. Reported complications of bacterial tracheitis include pneumomediastinum, sepsis and multi-organ failure, bronchospasm and impaired gas-exchange due to the burden of pseudomembranes with toxic shock syndrome [ 60 ] .

            "text": "Despite the relative commonality of laryngotracheal infections, there are no clearly defi ned guidelines by national organizations for their treatment. The clinical picture can be often frightening to the parents who bring the child to the emergency room. Fortunately, the vast majority of children show signs of rapid improvement after initiation of treatment using steroids and racemic epinephrine. Only a very small proportion of children require hospitalization and an even smaller proportion require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Complications are rare exceedingly rare. In contrast, bacterial tracheitis may have varied presentations and often requires endotracheal intubation and debridement in the operating room. Mortality is higher but early institution of culture-directed therapy is known to reduce the severity of disease and the incidence of complications. It is important for the astute clinician to recognize the symptoms of croup and maintain a high index of suspicion for conditions that masquerade as croup, such as a foreign body, supraglottitis (epiglottitis), subglottic stenosis and other anatomic abnormalities.",
