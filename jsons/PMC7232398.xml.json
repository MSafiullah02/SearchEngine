Second, we point out that there are trade-offs associated with this ability that actually lead to poor economic outcomes and also to inferior outcomes on other (prosperity-related) health indicators. Third, we point out that some dictators have an incentive to invest in healthcare if it serves to bolster their regime.

In 2015, Cuba had 782 physicians per 100 000 persons.20 This places Cuba close to three times the ratio observed in the USA and more than six times the ratio observed in the rest of Latin America. Also, as can be seen in table 1, the rate has been growing rapidly. In addition, a substantial share of gross domestic product (GDP) is allocated to the production of healthcare. In fact, these proportions are well above those observed for other Latin American countries with similar levels of economic development. The former USSR also did something very similar. The Soviet Union had twice as many physicians per 100 000 persons in 1986 than the USA.21 The Soviet Union also invested heavily in increasing the supply of physicians. The number of physicians relative to the population increased 16\u201318 times their 1917 level by 1970, while that of the USA remained more or less stable.22 Wider econometric assessments of health expenditures in dictatorships in the last decades confirm this ability (and incentives) of some dictators to force resources towards this end.23",

The control of infectious diseases often requires the use of coercive measures (eg, quarantines, mandatory forms of treatment and so on). Democratic regimes are more constrained in their ability to rely on such measures than dictatorships are, especially democratic regimes with strongly entrenched private property rights systems.30 If dictators possess the ability to allocate large shares of national wealth to the production of healthcare, they simultaneously possess the ability to rely more heavily on coercive measures. In addition, such coercive measures may result in the inability of individuals and families to decline the use and uptake of government-mandated healthcare services.",

It must be pointed out that the ability to use coercion in some dictatorial regimes generates both the improvement in health outcomes and the poverty observed in these societies. Consider the most-often lauded case of Cuba, which is both quite healthy and quite poor. Before the 1959 revolution, Cuba was one of the richest and most developed countries in Latin America.33 Its level of income inequality was slightly above the rest of Latin America but only modestly.34 Today, it is one of the poorest countries on the continent even if it is more equal.35 Jales et al36 used novel methods in causal inference econometrics to assess how rich Cuba would have been absent the revolution. They find that the country would be more than 30% richer than it is now. This is a substantial difference that Jales et al36 attribute to the role of the institutional regime established by Fidel Castro. This figure is probably an understatement as John Devereux37 shows the Cuban GDP. Rough estimations based on Devereux\u2019s37 proposed revisions would bring this proportion at more than 70%. It is also worth pointing out that they found no effect of the embargo on development. The coercive tools of the regime, which permit the improvements in health indicators such as infant mortality, are what make the country poor.",

This is an important trade-off because it is implicitly tied to the ability to further improve health in the future. Some causes of mortality are more easily combated through economic prosperity.30 41 42 By depressing economic growth, dictatorial regimes such as Cuba limit the ability to harness the health effects of growth. Moreover, this trade-off also explains why there are important deteriorations in health outcomes once dictatorships collapse. This is the case in former USSR countries. Levels of infant mortality and life expectancy prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union were contingent on the coercive abilities of the dictators that also made these countries relatively poor. When these abilities faltered, these health indicators were bound to deteriorate.",

The most reliable account of this function of the healthcare system comes from the ethnographic work of Katherine Hirschfeld, who conducted interviews with the local population (Hirschfeld, pp1\u221227).3132 45\u201347 Hirschfeld reports that doctors are also enrolled in the army, that they obtain military training and that they are required to report on possible dissent (Hirschfeld,46 pp216\u2013217). Privacy for patients is non-existent as it conflicts with the preservation of the regime. As such, physicians serve to shore up the regime which, it bears repeating, suggests that repression is a key element in the provision of healthcare in Cuba. In the former Soviet Union, a wide body of literature has been dedicated to documenting the political abuse of psychiatry. This is because political dissent was deemed a psychiatric problem, and the expansion of psychiatric care was used to punish dissent.48 During the Derg period in Ethiopia, similar political uses of provision of healthcare were recorded by scholars.49 These political uses in Ethiopia persist in a lesser form to this day, as physicians operating under performance targets set by the regime appear to use heavy-handed methods which are similar to those observed in Cuba.50",
