The source of the infection was a novel coronavirus, which was known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was then named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1\u20133]. At present, COVID-19 has spread throughout the world with an increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases. Thoracic high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), a highly feasible imaging method, plays an important role in the screening and treatment evaluation of COVID-19. We retrospectively reviewed 6 cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in our hospital to better understand the imaging features of early-stage pneumonia and provide radiologists with key diagnostic points.",

All patients underwent HRCT within 2 days after the onset of symptoms. All 6 patients had visited Wuhan or had contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. The clinical manifestations of these patients included fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. All patients were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acid via laboratory testing of respiratory secretions obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, endotracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab, or oropharyngeal swab. HRCT images were acquired using a GE scanner (GE Medical Systems Optima CT540) with slice thickness of 1.25 mm. The images were transmitted to the workstation and viewed in the PACS system.",

Based on their imaging feathers, COVID-19 can also be categorized into early stage, progressive stage, peak stage and absorption stage [4]. Studies show that early-stage COVID-19 usually manifests as localized inflammatory infiltration, with subpleural ground-glass opacity (GGO) in both lungs. Lesions are usually associated with thickened micro-vessels and thick-walled bronchi. If an air bronchogram accompanied with or without thickened interlobular septum can be seen within the lesion, a halo sign may also appear around the lesion. In rare cases, initial CT images are normal, while follow-up scans are positive [5].",

One patient who presented with bronchiolitis showed tree-in-bud (TIB) sign (Figure 1A, 1B), which is a rare imaging sign in viral infections, and this is the first report of this in a COVID-19 patient. The pathological basis of TIB is that mucus or pus blocking alveolar duct, respiratory bronchioles, and terminal bronchioles causes bronchiectasis, thickening of the bronchiole wall, and peribronchial inflammation [6]. Tree-in-bud sign can be seen in viral infection patients with immune dysfunction [7].",
