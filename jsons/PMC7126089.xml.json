The normal body temperature for crias is 37.8 to 38.9\u00b0C(100\u2013102\u00b0F) while normal heart rates vary from 70 to 100 beats per minute and respiratory rates from 20 to 30 breaths per minute. It is important that the initial physical assessment is done as quickly as possible in order to assess the need for immediate intervention and stabilization measures, such as oxygen therapy or fluid therapy, to address severe hypoglycemia. Look for any congenital defects, such as choanal atresia, cleft palate, or umbilical hernia, and ensure that the urinary and anal openings are patent. Make sure that there are no signs of an infected umbilicus. Check the heart carefully for murmurs but remember that hypovolemia, sepsis, and electrolyte abnormalities can be responsible for murmurs, but normally only up to grade III/VI. Pay particular attention to indications of sepsis, such as hyperemia of the mucous membranes and hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber of the eye). If hypopyon is not detected and treated with mydriatics, such as atropine drops, formation of fibrin strands may occur within the anterior chamber resulting in development of synechiae; these may subsequently result in glaucoma and necessitate enucleation. Look for evidence of prematurity and listen carefully to the lungs for any indication of premature-lung syndrome.",

            "text": "By the time most crias present for evaluation, they are often going to require intravenous fluid therapy of some sort. Therefore, it is reasonable to place an IV catheter early in the evaluation so that emergency treatment can be initiated while the examination is under way. Furthermore, blood samples can be collected from the catheter immediately after sterile placement for hematology, biochemistry, and culture, thereby reducing the number of venipuncture sites. Hematoma formation is even more common in crias than in adults and each venipuncture increases the chance of introducing pathogenic bacteria into the bloodstream of the neonate. Rapid evaluation of glucose on a handheld glucometer and packed cell volume (PCV) and total protein assessment can give useful early clues for therapy. If an in-house hematology analyzer is not available, then a fresh blood smear should be examined to guide diagnosis and antibiotic choice. Arterial or venous blood-gas analysis is also ideal. There are some good quality handheld blood-gas analyzers available now, but their accuracy in camelids is so far untested. They may prove to be an excellent tool for practitioners working with camelids in the field because of the rapidity with which results are available. This may greatly enhance diagnostic ability and aid in decision making on the farm.",

            "text": "For crias, an 18-guage, 2-inch Angiocath catheter is ideally placed into the jugular vein for up to 5 days and is easy to place. For crias that may require a catheter for longer periods, then a 16\u2013guage, polyurethane over-the-wire catheter (MILA International, KY) would be more appropriate because they are less thrombogenic and they become dislodged less frequently. The latter are a little more technically demanding to place and require strict attention to sterility during placement. The jugular vein in crias is easier to catheterize than those of adults because the overlying skin is not as thick and the vein can be readily visualized once the skin has been clipped. Peripheral veins, such as the cephalic vein, are hard to visualize in crias and are difficult to maintain because they are highly positional. They are also not suitable for plasma administration. It is important that the handler has proper control of the cria to minimize vascular trauma during placement. Local anesthetic infiltration of the site of venipuncture greatly enhances catheter placement (0.2\u20130.3 mL lidocaine). The author prefers the cria to be positioned in sternal recumbency with the head held so that the neck is straight and immobilized; others prefer the cria to be positioned in lateral recumbency. The drawings in Fig. 1\nillustrate the author's preferred technique. In crias with hypovolemia, the blood pressure may be so poor that it is not able to displace a column of heparinized saline within the catheter. Therefore, in crias it may be advisable to flush the catheter and then let the flush drain through prior to placement.",

Oxygen can be administered by way of a face mask or nasal insufflation tubes; those used for humans work well for crias and they can be secured around the back of the head. They are generally better tolerated than face masks and free up the operator to do other tasks as it is not necessary for them to be constantly present holding a mask in place. If these are not available, a small-diameter flexible catheter can be inserted up one nostril to the level of the medial canthus and secured in position for oxygen supplementation. If intubation is required for a cria that is not breathing by itself, an endotracheal tube (size 4\u20136) can be placed with the aid of a long-bladed laryngoscope and a dog urinary catheter can be used as a stylet to guide placement.",

            "text": "Once the IV catheter has been placed, the blood-glucose concentration should be checked on a handheld glucometer and any hypoglycemia should be addressed. If hypoglycemia is severe, it is recommended to give a slow infusion of about 50 mL of dextrose-containing fluid (ideally about 10% dextrose) over about 5 to 10 minutes. This provides a safe volume of resuscitation fluid and this can be repeated 20 to 30 minutes later if required. Large volumes of fluid can easily induce pulmonary edema in crias. Boluses of hypertonic dextrose solutions (eg, 50% dextrose) may worsen any preexisting CNS problems and should generally be avoided.1 Further fluid-therapy decisions can be made once the results of biochemistry are available. In general, maintenance fluid-therapy requirements are about 50% higher than those of adults. The author uses a guide of 1.5 mL/lb/hr for maintenance in crias (or 3.3 mL/kg/hr) and this can be administered by continuous rate infusion using an infusion pump. When crias are more active and able to get up and nurse for themselves, bolus administration of fluids every 2 to 4 hours can be easier to manage since the cria does not need to be separated from its dam. When administering glucose or dextrose to sick crias, it is important to monitor blood-glucose concentrations serially as crias do appear to be prone to a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (discussed elsewhere in the issue).2 For this reason, checking blood-glucose concentration is warranted from the perspective of assessing and managing hyperglycemic crias.",

            "text": "A plasma transfusion may be warranted in certain situations. In an emergency situation with a neonate less than 7 days of age, provided congenital abnormalities have been ruled out, plasma is almost certainly going to be required since the cria is likely to have some degree of FPT, regardless of the underlying cause. As detailed elsewhere in this issue, there are several ways to assess adequacy of passive transfer. Since the most accurate radial immunodiffusion (RID) test takes 24 hours to run, a more immediate, but crude, assessment can be made using a refractometer reading of total solids as long as the clinician is aware of the limitations of this method. If the refractometer reading is really low (<4.5 g/dL), this is consistent with FPT; if the cria is dehydrated, the actual reading would be even lower. Above this it may be difficult to be sure, so protein and globulin concentration determination on biochemistry results may be more useful. However, Dolente and colleagues3 found that there was no significant difference between the total protein concentrations in septic crias with positive blood cultures regardless of whether the cria was shown to have FPT or not. The authors suggested that there may be many factors relating to sepsis that make total-protein assessment an unreliable indicator of IgG concentration.",

Plasma is much more effective than crystalloid fluids at expanding volume in very ill neonates, since these crias often have increased endothelial permeability caused by inflammatory changes as a result of sepsis and endotoxemia. Clinically, the observed response during a plasma transfusion can be quite rewarding. The safest method of plasma administration is intravenously using an administration set with an in-line filter that filters out any protein clots. The author typically gives 1 mg/kg of flunixin meglumine intravenously as a premedication about 5 to 15 minutes before commencing the infusion. Very rarely, anaphylactic reactions may occur, therefore it is important to start the transfusion slowly in order to minimize the potential effects should anaphylaxis occur. Normally, it is advisable to give the transfusion over 30 to 40 minutes while monitoring the heart for excessive tachycardia or rhythm disturbances and respiratory rate, but larger volumes (40 mL/kg) should be given over an hour. Anecdotally, the author has known 20 mL/kg to be given over 5-10 minutes due to operating within a veterinary teaching hospital without adverse consequences although this rapid an infusion is not recommended!",

            "text": "Newborns are especially susceptible to hypothermia and hypoglycemia.These conditions will often occur together as hypothermic neonates will not stand up to nurse resulting in hypoglycemia. At birth, neonates are subjected to a rapid drop in external temperature and are highly dependent upon nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) to create heat.4 This process takes place in the mitochondria of brown-adipose tissue and results in an uncoupling of fatty acid oxidation such that heat energy is produced instead of ATP. It is highly dependent on adequate oxygenation, therefore, hypoxemic neonates are more susceptible to the development of hypothermia. Additionally, premature neonates are likely to have inadequate reserves of brown-adipose tissue which develops in the fetus under the influence of NST inhibitors, leaving them at increased risk of hypothermia at birth. Shivering may provide an additional source of heat but the likely impact is small in neonates becase of their small size and immature musculature. The presence of brown-adipose tissue has not been specifically documented in camelids to date, so it is uncertain to what extent NST plays a role in averting hypothermia in crias. Thyroid hormones are thought to play a role in enhancing thermogenesis in the newborn: neonatal llama crias have been shown to have very high thyroxine concentrations at birth, which decreased gradually over the first 90 days of life.5\n",

If heating pads or lamps are used, appropriate insulation from direct heat should be used and care must be taken to ensure that a recumbent cria is turned frequently to avoid overheating. Excessive heat may result in cutaneous vasodilation, which may be detrimental to the cria as it will further reduce core temperature and result in further cardiovascular compromise.

FPT was a common finding in septic crias in the study previously mentioned3 and highlights the importance of ensuring adequate colostrum ingestion in newborn crias. Presenting complaints in crias with sepsis include lethargy, depression, failure to nurse or even a failure to gain weight or a loss of weight over a 24-hour period. As previously mentioned, hypothermia, tachycardia, and tachypnea are relatively common clinical findings. Additionally, there may be evidence of dehydration and injected mucous membranes. From personal experience, crias presenting with a history of failure to gain weight or a loss of weight over the preceding 24 hours may have normal physical examination findings, but hematology performed at this time may reveal a significant leukocytosis or leukopenia with a left shift supportive of the onset of sepsis. Blood work may also reveal findings suggestive of FPT, such as hypoproteinemia and hypoglobulinemia. Treatment at this stage may often avert a crisis presentation 12 to 24 hours later and supports the recommendation of being proactive in terms of performing diagnostics in neonatal camelids. Crias will deteriorate rapidly if early signs of sepsis are not recognized and treated. Additional laboratory findings later on in sepsis may include hypo- or hyperglycemia, azotemia as a result of dehydration or kidney failure, and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities.

Plasma transfusions are usually required to treat any underlying FPT, but plasma is also very effective at expanding volume in septic crias as they will often have increased endothelial permeability caused by inflammatory changes as a result of sepsis and endotoxemia. Crias can develop hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and hyperosmolarity in response to dehydration and stress.2 Sepsis can exacerbate the syndrome. Camelids are prone to hyperglycemia as a result of stress as they are known to exhibit poor pancreatic responses resulting in slower glucose clearance than other species.10 Crias appear to be able to clear glucose more rapidly because of stronger insulin responses and they are also better able to respond to exogenous insulin, but this may not be true in sick crias.11 Hypernatremia results from loss of water as a result of glucose diuresis. Even on isotonic fluids, such as lactated Ringer's solution, crias have a tendency to become hypernatremic, therefore the author prefers to use fluids with lower sodium concentrations (eg 0.45% sodium chloride with 2.5% dextrose as long as there is no preexisting hyperglycemia). It is important to monitor glucose concentrations and electrolytes when managing sick crias. Insulin therapy (at a dose of 0.2 IU/kg SQ11) is indicated in hyperglycemic crias to prevent ongoing glucose diuresis, and supplementation of fluids with potassium chloride is often required to prevent or treat hypokalemia.",

Commercialization of alpaca breeding in the developed world especially in the United States, Australia and Europe, for fiber production has led to increased stocking densities inevitably exposing young stock to higher concentrations of potential pathogens. Nutritional factors, such as overfeeding with bottle-fed orphans, may play a role but infectious pathogens are an increasingly important factor in neonatal diarrhea. A knowledge of the types of agents involved and at what age these infectious agents are likely to cause disease is important in deciding which diagnostic tests to perform and in initiating treatment. Additionally, the clinician must realise that failure to reach a diagnosis and treat the cause of diarrhea effectively will often lead to chronic diarrhea, which may ultimately result in chronic renal failure. Failure of passive transfer predisposes the neonate to bacterial, viral and protozoal agents but each tends to have a characteristic clinical presentation and this may help guide the clinician with regard to therapeutic options.",

Cryptosporidium oocysts are extremely resistant to decay in the environment and to most disinfectants. As few as 10 oocysts can induce disease in susceptible individuals, while clinically affected calves can shed massive numbers of oocysts during infections forming a significant source of infection for other animals.27 Additionally, asymptomatic adult cattle are thought to be a major source of environmental contamination. The exact mechanism by which Cryptosporidium attaches and invades enterocytes is poorly understood at the present time. However, it is known that following attachment, Cryptosporidium forms a parasitophorous vacuole within the host cell (intracellular but extracytoplasmic) bounded by a parasitophorous vacuolar membrane derived from the host-cell membrane. This protects the organism from the hostile environment of the gut lumen and the host cell's defenses. An additional feeder organelle membrane in Cryptosporidium, as opposed to other coccidian parasites, is thought to be primarily responsible for nutrient uptake from the host cell. Inclusion of Cryptosporidium within enterocytes reduces gastrointestinal absorption in affected individuals caused by loss of epithelium, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (malabsorptive diarrhea). Maldigestion also occurs as a result of the loss of membrane-bound digestive enzymes, such that weight loss and emaciation in neonates is typical. Autoinfection can occur. The author has diagnosed renal failure in multiple crias with cryptosporidiosis. The mechanism of kidney damage is presumed to be prolonged states of subclinical dehydration leading to reduced renal perfusion and tubular necrosis.",

Coccidiosis is typically associated with overcrowding and poor hygiene. The pathogenesis and severity of the clinical signs observed may be associated with the number of coccidia ingested. Reinfections from a contaminated environment can cause an excessive coccidia burden that may be fatal.36 Coccidia undergo sexual and asexual reproduction stages within the intestinal epithelia to produce oocysts and these cause direct damage to the epithelial mucosa of the small intestine resulting in enteritis and diarrhea. Tenesmus may be observed. Diarrhea may be hemorrhagic and contain shreds of sloughed mucosa. As a result, nutrient malabsorption and subsequent poor growth ensues.

Consideration should be given to application of preventative measures before and during stressful events, such as weaning, shearing, or herd movements. Amprolium may be used prophylactically and is added to water at 5 mg/kg body weight daily over a 21-day period. Correct dosage of amprolium is important since it is a thiamine analogue and overdosing may produce clinical polioencephalomalacia. Alternatively, decoquinate may be used more safely when added to feed at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days.

The right hand is placed over the shoulders to prevent the cria from jumping up and the left hand cradles the cria's jaw ensuring that the cria can breathe easily. It helps to hold the cria's head against the chest to give added control. It is important that the cria's neck is in a straight line with its body and that the head is not pulled across to one side, which is less comfortable for the cria and makes it harder for catheter placement. (B) Local anesthetic placement. Following clipping of a rectangle of hair from over the jugular vein on the right side of the neck, the site is prepared aseptically. A subcutaneous bleb of local anesthetic (about 0.2\u20130.3 mL lidocaine in a cria) is placed over the jugular vein using a 25 g needle. (C, D) Catheter placement. The catheter is placed through the site of local anesthetic infiltration directly into the jugular vein. Once the catheter is in the vein, advance it just slightly so that it is properly seated in the vein. For a right-handed person, the stylet is held between thumb and finger using the right hand and the catheter is advanced over the stylet into the vein using the left finger and thumb placed on the hub of the catheter. It helps to anchor the right hand fingers against the cria's neck in order to help prevent the skin from rucking up as you slide the catheter into the vein. Blood can be collected at this point for diagnostics. (E, F) Attach extension tubing and secure in place. Extension tubing containing heparinized- flush solution is attached to the hub of the catheter. Use the shorter extension sets that have a clamp or valve. It is not necessary to suture the catheter in place; an elasticon bandage wrapped first behind the catheter and over the hub in order to secure it in place works well. Over-the-wire catheters should be sutured. Place a sterile injection port on the end of the extension tubing; this should be changed every 24 hours.",
