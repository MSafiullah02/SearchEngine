After the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea, the KCDC revised and improved its Event-Based Surveillance system and the risk assessment tool, and continued to evaluate the risk of public health events based on the impact of diseases and probability of importation. Risk assessment in the ROK mainly aims to provide basic information to the relevant public health authorities. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the ROK conducted risk assessment exercises on 8 occasions, followed by implementation of response measures. The ROK has reported a total of 5,766 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 35 deaths as of March 5th 2020. This study summarized how KCDC conducted its risk assessments based on the available evidence, with details of measures taken as a result of the risk assessments performed.",

The initial format of the system was established using the overall structure of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) rapid risk assessment procedures, and updated and modified this based on the requirements of the institution. To estimate the overall risk of specific public health events, probability, and impact at the country-level were evaluated using the available information. For the probability of certain public health events, risk of importation and risk of transmission were taken into consideration. KCDC risk assessment was categorized into 5 levels (\u201cvery low,\u201d \u201clow,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201chigh,\u201d and \u201cvery high\u201d), and overall risk was determined [4]. The emergence of COVID-19, which started as clusters of pneumonia with unknown etiology in China at the end of 2019, was unique and thus, a good example for KCDC to conduct a series of risk assessments to evaluate the potential risk of importation, transmission, and the impact at the country-level. The risk of importation and transmission were evaluated separately as COVID-19 was a newly identified pathogen where information about the coronavirus was limited. Predefined criteria triggered the KCDC risk assessment and enabled each risk assessment to be described in detail.",

The overall risk of the situation was considered \u201clow\u201d in the first risk assessment. The risk of importation was estimated \u201cvery low\u201d due to the immediate closure of the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan on January 1st. The risk of importation to Korea was \u201clow,\u201d but could not be excluded given the unknown nature of the respiratory pathogens and unknown human to human transmissibility. The impact of the outbreak was \u201clow,\u201d as no fatal cases had been reported in China.

There was no evidence of human to human transmission until this time and no additional case had been officially reported in China since January 3rd. The overall risk was escalated to \u201cmoderate\u201d due to the increased risk of importation (\u201clow\u201d to \u201chigh\u201d) and transmission (\u201clow\u201d to \u201cmoderate\u201d). The risk of importation was estimated as \u201chigh\u201d because of the imported cases identified in Thailand and Japan, indicating a possibility of under-reporting of cases due to the unknown nature of the virus. The risk of transmission was also escalated due to the report of 1 potential family cluster in Wuhan, and contact history with an unidentified pneumonia patient from Japan. The impact was \u201clow\u201d as there had been only 1 fatal case who had underlying chronic conditions and the rest of the patients were in stable conditions. Additionally, evidence of recovery of patients in Japan and Thailand also influenced the estimation. On January 11th, the WHO confirmed that the pathogen was a novel coronavirus and a validated primer was distributed and diagnostic probe was made available from January 11th.",

It helps to reduce the burden of national health systems, and to increase the number of laboratory testing kits and increase capacity in the healthcare system. Communication of risk at this stage informs the stakeholders of public health measures, including case isolation, contact tracing, and PPE use. ECDC evaluations of the likelihood of importation to Europe were escalated from \u201clow\u201d to \u201cmoderate,\u201d and likelihood of importation to neighboring Asian countries as \u201chigh.\u201d Infection contracted in hospital was considered a \u201clow\u201d risk when appropriate infection prevention and control measures were in place [9].

Firstly, the information in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak was preliminary and very limited, mainly since COVID-19 was a new emerging disease, and data from the Chinese government was the main source of information of this novel coronavirus. Thus, we conducted several risk assessments with the ongoing available evidence, in a very short period of time as the situation evolved rapidly. Therefore, the estimation was very likely to be subjective in nature. Secondly, the risk assessment tool was not strictly applied to this novel pathogen as critical information was missing and had to be estimated with limited confirmed evidence. Thus, initial evaluation of this virus pathogenesis was likely to be subjective, and was the one of major factors that needed to be considered when conducting the risk assessment. Once more scientific evidence and knowledge becomes available after the end of this pandemic, overall review procedures and evaluation mechanisms need to be developed to improve and to minimize the limitations of the existing risk assessments by the Korea CDC.",
