Amongst the five species that can affect humans, Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent, causing most of the malaria-related deaths globally. According to the latest World Malaria Report,1 in 2017, there were still 219 million cases of malaria leading to 435,000 deaths. Beside this high biomedical burden, malaria impedes social and economic development in endemic areas.2 A reduction in the global malaria disease burden has been achieved during the last decade by integrated disease control programs. This gain is at risk by the potential spread of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and drug-resistant parasites.1 Consequently, an effective vaccine would be a complementary tool to reduce the burden of malaria in integrated control programs and could support efforts towards malaria elimination.3 Currently no effective malaria vaccine is commercially available, but numerous vaccine design strategies against malaria infection, disease or transmission are being actively pursued, including development of subunit vaccines and whole sporozoite vaccination approaches.4",

Also effective particle-based antigen delivery platforms have been developed to achieve adequate immunogenicity. Some antigen delivery systems, like virosomes, can co-deliver immunostimodulators to enhance immunogenicity further.18 Preclinical and clinical studies have proven the suitability of influenza derived virosomes as antigen carrier system for malaria-derived peptidomimetics and recombinant proteins.19 These virosomes are non-replicating virus-like particles, prepared from the membrane of solubilised influenza virus mixed with synthetic phospholipids and vaccine antigens with or without adjuvants. The hemagglutinin (HA) membrane glycoprotein of the influenza virus harbours T helper cell epitopes that enhance the immune response particularly for small antigens, like peptides. Virosomes loaded with different antigens can be combined to formulate a multi-component subunit vaccine, making them a versatile and modular antigen delivery system with an excellent tolerance and safety profile in children, adults and elderlies, based on experience with the market approved influenza and hepatitis A virosome-based vaccines.20",

Protein subunit vaccine approaches typically require co-administration of strong adjuvants or effective antigen delivery systems such as virus-like particles to overcome the poor immunogenicity of recombinant proteins. Here we tested a monovalent candidate malaria vaccine based on the recombinant PfCyRPA target protein displayed on the surface of influenza virosomes, representing virus-like particles approved for use in humans. While in this first study unadjuvanted PfCyRPA influenza virosomes were tested, adjuvanted human-compatible formulations are under development that may offer the advantage to have both antigens and adjuvants bound to the same particle with no free-form adjuvant, improving the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine. The concept of using antigen-loaded influenza virosomes for vaccination against malaria in humans has already been clinically validated with a virosomal formulation incorporating optimised peptidomimetics derived from the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1).19 This bivalent virosomal vaccine candidate demonstrated excellent safety, immunogenicity and pilot efficacy in a Phase 1b trial in African children.21 Antigen delivery using influenza virosomes enables the design of multivalent vaccines, as different populations of antigen-loaded virosomes can be combined. This is an important prerequisite, since it is generally assumed that a highly effective malaria subunit vaccine has to target antigens of several developmental stages of the parasite.",

Besides antibody fine-specificity and binding avidity, recently also the kinetic parameters for antibody binding to its target emerged as a key indicator of potency for merozoite neutralising antibodies. The ability of recombinant human anti-PfRH5 mAbs generated after vaccination with viral vectored PfRH5 to inhibit parasite growth in vitro correlated with antibody association-rates. Moreover, one anti-PfRH5 mAb without neutralising activity potentiated the activities of other inhibitory antibodies indirectly, by slowing down the invasion time of merozoites and thereby increasing the time window for inhibitory antibodies to act.23",

After having established that vaccine-induced antibodies bound to the endogenous PfCyRPA protein expressed in the invasive stage of the parasite blood-stage cycle, we conducted in vitro GIAs with blood-stage parasites cultured in human red blood cells. This analysis compares invasion and growth of parasites in the absence and presence of antibodies. Although validation of the antibody-mediated GIA as a correlate of protection in humans has been difficult to establish, this assay has been commonly used to select and prioritise blood-stage vaccine candidates for final preclinical and clinical development. Purified total IgG preparations of all PfCyRPA-immunised rabbits showed substantial and dose\u2010dependent GIA activities. At a concentration of 5 mg/mL total IgG, 50\u201385% growth inhibition was observed with all rabbit IgG samples. While the small number of animals per group limits statistical interpretation of the results, higher mean activities were observed in rabbits that received three doses of antigen-loaded virosomes. The mean total IgG concentration giving 50% GIA for rabbits that received three vaccine doses was 0.94 mg/mL total IgG. This value lies within the broad range of GIA IC50 values (between 0.38 mg/mL17 and 5.07 mg/mL24) that have been reported for total IgG generated by immunising rabbits with adjuvanted recombinant PfCyRPA. All three studies used recombinant PfCyRPA proteins produced in HEK 293 cells but the immunisation strategies were not equivalent. In the study of Bustamante et al.,17 which reported the lowest GIA IC50 value, rabbits were immunised four times with a total amount of 0.3\u20130.6 mg of purified antigen.

The development of an improved murine model of malaria using P. falciparum competent strains and NSG mice engrafted with human erythrocytes,25 which was established and is extensively used for malaria drug development, has opened new possibilities for the preclinical evaluation and prioritisation of candidate vaccines against erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum. We adopted the improved P. falciparum infection mouse model for the assessment of the efficacy of antibodies against blood-stage antigens in passive immunoprotection experiments.7 Antibody transfer experiments in this in vivo model demonstrated dose-dependent and reproducible growth-inhibitory effects of mouse mAbs specific for the blood-stage vaccine candidates PfCyRPA and PfRH5.7,10,16 In the present study, humanised NSG mice were passively immunised with purified total IgG from individual rabbits that received three vaccine doses of antigen-loaded virosomes. One day after the antibody transfer, mice were infected with P. falciparum 3D7 parasites. Passive transfer of vaccine-induced polyclonal anti-PfCyRPA antibodies did not completely prevent establishment of infection but reduced parasite growth in a dose-dependent manner by about 77% (10 mg dose) and 66% (5 mg dose) on day 6 after infection. The concentration of total rabbit IgG in the circulation of the passively immunised mice that received 10 mg of total IgG, was estimated to be 1.23 mg/mL one day after administration (the day of infection) and 0.29 mg/mL at day 7 (the day of the measured final parasitemia). These concentrations were from the beginning of the parasite challenge much lower than the concentration of IgG in normal rabbit serum, which ranges from 5 to 12 mg/mL. Considering in addition the relatively quick in vivo clearance of the rabbit antibodies, while the parasite keeps replicating, the inhibition of parasite growth is remarkable. The PfCyRPA-specific IgG is expected to represent only a small fraction of the total IgG. In previous passive immunoprotection experiments with parasite inhibitory monoclonal antibodies, administration of 2.5 mg inhibitory anti-PfCyRPA or anti-PfRH5 mAbs was required to achieve a maximal parasitemia reduction of about 90%.10,16 An even higher reduction of parasite burden (95% inhibition) was observed in the mouse model when 2.5 mg inhibitory anti-PfCyRPA and 2.5 mg inhibitory anti-PfRH5 mAbs were injected in combination.16",

Plasmids were amplified by transforming chemically competent Escherichia coli bacteria and used for transfection of human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells. The histidine-tagged protein was purified from concentrated cell culture supernatant by immobilised metal ion affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant PfCyRPA protein was lipidated prior to incorporation into the influenza virosomes membrane derived from the flu strain A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1). In short, purified PfCyRPA in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 142.5 mM NaCl buffer was randomly modified on accessible lysine residues by reacting with a five-fold molar excess of 2-Iminothiolane for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, before addition of the maleimide-derivatized phospholipid N-MCC-DPPE (1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[4-(p-maleinimidomethyl)cyclohexane-carboxamide], Corden Pharma LLC, Switzerland) for 1 h at room temperature. Unused maleimide groups were quenched by the addition of cysteine. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the modification of > 95% of the PfCyRPA molecules. Native immunoblot and ELISA analysis confirmed the reactivity of the modified protein with the parasite inhibitory anti-PfCyRPA mAb c12 to the same extend as the unmodified PfCyRPA. The virosomal formulations with the lipidated PfCyRPA were prepared essentially as described.20,26 The lipidated PfCyRPA was mixed with the membrane fraction of the inactivated influenza virus strain A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), solubilized in 100 mM dodecyl octaethylene glycol ether (OEG; Sigma, Switzerland) in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 142.5 mM NaCl buffer, and with synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC; Merck & Cie, Switzerland). The concentrated virosome intermediate mixture with the integrated PfCyRPA protein was obtained after removal of OEG on polystryrene beads (Bio-Beads; Bio-Rad, Switzerland) in a batch chromatography. After determination of the PfCyRPA antigen concentration by ELISA and native immunoblot, the final vaccine was prepared by dilution of the intermediate mixture to the required final antigen concentration in HEPES-NaCl pH 7.4 buffer, followed by a final filtration step on a 0.22 \u00b5m PVDF syringe filter.",
