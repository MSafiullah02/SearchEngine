Several epidemiological features of BN may be explained in this way. The medical geography of BN, its mozaic pattern and the stability of its foci would thus be a reflection of the topographical distribution of the virus reservoir. The absence of interhuman transmission can be explained by the fact that humans do not excrete the agent and the familial pattern of the disease and the similar mortality in both sexes, by common exposure in (or around) the house. Visitors to affected households would not be at risk for contracting BN because of the susceptibility of the viruses, which are likely to be transmitted only early in the morning, shortly after being excreted by the rodents. The increased incidence of BN seen in the mid-fifties could be related to an ecological imbalance caused by DDT poisoning of cats, who act as a natural barrier between humans and rodents.
