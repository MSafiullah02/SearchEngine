Primary lesions in one of the single animals [14] and the group of three involved the elbow joints and legs. Pathology in these animals resembled hypertrophic pulmonary osteopathy seen in dogs. The other single animal had multiple exotoses of the ribs, especially dorsally and near the spine. Several of the affected animals had either concomitant renal disease or eventually succumbed to renal disease. While kidney disease can cause changes in calcium metabolism, the lesions in the red pandas did not resemble renal secondary hyperparathyroidism. An aetiology for these conditions has not been identified but hypervitaminosis A was postulated as a contributing factor in the group of three cases [15].",

Thyroid function is usually normal in most animals showing hair loss or patchy coats, and the cause of these cases remains unclear. Many have observed a seasonal hair loss, especially at the base of the tail, occurring when the temperature rises in spring and loss of winter coats begins. A perineal dermatitis has also been observed in yearling female red pandas during the spring. Increased amounts of oestrogen have been proposed as a cause of this syndrome (D.

Red pandas in regions of the USA where this parasite is endemic are routinely given prophylactic anti-microfilaria treatment. Ivermectin, at a dosage of 0.05 mg/kg p.o. q.30 days, therapy is started at 6 months of age and continued throughout the animal\u2019s life. In regions with severe winters, treatment may be suspended during the winter months. In the southeastern USA, heartworm prophylaxis is given year-round. In most European countries where red pandas are kept in zoos, Dirofilaria immitis is not endemic, although dirofilariasis has been reported in a red panda in southern France (D. White, personal communication).",

Lungworms have been associated with pathology in red pandas and were identified in one survey as a major cause of morbidity in northwestern European countries (D. White, personal communication). Clinical signs of lungworm infections may be subtle and the infection may only be recognized at necropsy. Infections have been variously attributed to Troglostrongulus spp., Angiostrongylus spp., Crenosoma spp., and Metastrongyloides spp. [21].",

This usually occurs during warm weather, when other animals in the collection are infested. Red panda infestations may be quite severe and deaths due to anaemia secondary to flea infestations have been observed, particularly in mother-raised cubs still in the nest boxes. The pattern of hair loss on the lower back and tail resemble those seen in flea-hypersensitivity in domestic animals, although fleas or flea faeces are not always found. It is recommended that keepers caring for red pandas are not in contact with animals which are commonly infected with fleas. Where this is unavoidable, measures should be taken to avoid contamination of red panda nest boxes. It is also advisable to change red panda bedding regularly. When birth is imminent, treatment of the nest boxes with some anti-flea preparation helps to avoid infant infestations. A number of anti-flea treatments have been used and, generally, those products which are safe and approved for use in domestic cats are effective. Domestic feline dosage regimens for imidacloprid, selamectin, nitenpyram, and fipronil have all been used in red pandas at the Knoxville Zoo without adverse side effects. Caution must be used as at least one zoo killed a panda cub by putting it in a flea bath.",

MLV vaccines have been designed to be minimally virulent, while retaining maximal immunogenicity in their domestic counterparts. When used in highly sensitive species or delivered by another route, the residual virulence may cause disease [37]. There are two widely used attenuated CDV vaccine strains: the Onderstepoort strain, attenuated in avian, and now more commonly co-cultivated in Vero cells; and the Rockport strain, attenuated in canine cells. Although the avian-attenuated CDV vaccines are generally safer when used in mammals, neither is safe for use in non-domestic species, as both types have caused fatal disease in a variety of species [38]. Published vaccine-induced distemper in red pandas has been caused by the Rockport strain [34], [35]. While MLV vaccines are not recommended for use in non-domestic species, currently MLV canine distemper vaccines continue to be used in Chinese facilities, despite questionable efficacy and safety [32], and reports indicate that vaccine-induced disease and mortality is common [33].",

The CDV-ISCOM vaccine has since been shown to be safe in several species in European zoos (W. Schaftenaar personal communication) [45], [46]. Red pandas reacted to vaccination with higher antibody titres when the total antigen concentration of the CDV-ISCOM was increased from 5 \u03bcg/ml to 10 \u03bcg/ml, suggesting a positive dose-response [45], although the concentration should not exceed 10 \u03bcg/ml to minimize local reactions to the vaccine. Three vaccinations with a 10 \u03bcg/ml vaccine are recommended with a 3-week interval, e.g. young animals at 8, 11, and 14 weeks of age, with one annual revaccination [45].",

Neonates are usually \u201cmasked down,\u201d by placing a face mask over their face, and having them breathe 5% isoflurane in oxygen. Alternatively, an induction chamber (an opaque plastic box with a tight top) can be used in all age groups. Anaesthesia is induced by flowing 5% isoflurane in oxygen into the box. The animal is removed from the induction chamber when recumbent, and a face mask or endotracheal tube can be applied to maintain anaesthesia. With either induction method, when the animal is recumbent the percentage of isoflurane is reduced to 1.5\u20133% isoflurane in oxygen for maintenance of anaesthesia. The chamber inductions are relatively slow but recoveries are rapid and animals are quickly able to be returned to their exhibit. Other new inhalant agents, such as sevoflurane, should work comparatively well.",

Typically, the animal is transferred from a crate to a small squeeze cage and the drugs are given intramuscularly, via hand injection. The effects of the medetomidine can be reversed with atipamezole (0.4 mg/kg i.m.), and recoveries are usually rapid and smooth.",

More routine veterinary care and better preventive medicine programmes, such as vaccination and parasitology surveillance, have also contributed to red pandas living longer. One can anticipate that more attention will be paid in the future to the treatment of geriatric diseases of red pandas. Poor captive reproduction and infant survival are challenges we still face with this species and must do more to address. Better techniques to evaluate reproductive soundness are something that veterinarians and reproductive physiologists need to develop for this species. Continued efforts are also needed, by managers and health care staff, to improve mothering of cubs, with the aim of reducing the number of cubs that need to be hand-reared.\n",
