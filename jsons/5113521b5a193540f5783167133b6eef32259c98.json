            "text": "Progress in the elucidation of RSV gene function [17] and the use of reverse genetics systems [18] led to the development of rationally designed attenuated RSV strains, including strains attenuated through deletion of the NS2 gene. NS2 is a virally encoded type I and III interferon antagonist that interferes with interferon induction and signaling [19] [20] [21] . Deletion of the NS2 gene diminished RSV replication in chimpanzees [22] . The increased interferon response to infection may enhance the adaptive immune response, as has been demonstrated for bovine RSV with NS1 or NS2 deletion in calves [23] . NS2 also functions as a pathogenicity factor, promoting epithelial cell shedding in vitro and in the hamster model, potentially contributing to small airway obstruction [24] . Thus, deletion of NS2 may be beneficial for vaccine safety. Recently, a candidate vaccine was developed that contains the NS2 deletion and the attenuating deletion of codon 1313 in the polymerase (L) gene, which also confers mild temperature sensitivity (shutoff temperature of 38\u00baC-39\u00baC [24] ;). This deletion was genetically and phenotypically stabilized by substitution of leucine (L) for isoleucine (I) at codon 1314. The resultant virus, RSV/\u0394NS2/ \u03941313/I1314L, was attenuated and immunogenic in nonhuman primates [25] .",

RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L contains 2 independent attenuating elements: (1) a 523 nucleotide deletion of the NS2 gene and (2) a codon deletion in the L gene (\u03941313; deletion of S1313) plus the adjacent missense mutation I1314L that prevents the compensatory deattenuating mutation I1314T [25] . The virus was generated from cDNA on World Health Organization Vero cells by reverse genetics [18] , and clinical trial material (CTM) was prepared at Charles River Laboratories. Sequence analysis confirmed that the seed virus and CTM were free of detectable adventitious mutations. The CTM had a mean infectivity titer of 10 7.3 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. CTM was stored at \u221270\u00b0C and diluted to dose on site using Leibovitz L15 medium. L15 medium was used as placebo.",

Infectivity and replication of this vaccine was significantly improved with an increased dose: at 10 6 PFU, vaccine virus was detected in 16 of 20 vaccinees by culture (P < 0.0001; Fisher exact test) and in 18 of 20 by RT-qPCR (Table 1 and Figure 3A and 3B), and most vaccinees shed vaccine virus over several days ( Figure 3C and 3D). For most vaccinees, the peak of vaccine shedding was detectable by culture and by RT-qPCR between days 5 and 10 ( Figure 3C and 3D; triangles) . At both the 10 5 PFU and 10 6 PFU doses, the magnitude of vaccine virus replication was highly restricted (mean peak titer by culture, 10 0.6 and 10 1.8 PFU; mean peak copy number by RT-qPCR, 10 3.0 and 10 3.5 among those who were infected) ( Table 1 and Figure 3A and 3B), indicative of the substantial attenuation of this vaccine. RT-PCR and partial sequence analysis of NW isolates obtained at the peak of vaccine shedding from 18 of 20 RSV-seronegative vaccinees who received 10 6 PFU confirmed the presence of the NS2 deletion and the \u22061313 and I1314L mutations.",

Rhinorrhea occurred more often in seronegative vaccinees than in placebo recipients, although the differences were not statistically significant when the 10 5 PFU and 10 6 PFU dose cohorts were considered singly or together. Rates of illness did not increase with the higher dose. Other respiratory viruses were detected frequently in vaccinees and placebo recipients, consistent with previous studies [6, 30] , but we also encountered a substantial number of respiratory events without concurrent detection of any pathogen. This high incidence of background respiratory illness, typical for this age group, and the inability to detect potential causative agents in some symptomatic children, indicate that larger studies will be needed to determine whether administration of RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L is associated with an increased risk of mild respiratory illness. Should administration of RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L be associated with transient rhinorrhea, this would probably be acceptable if efficacy against RSV-associated LRI was demonstrated.",

In the current study, we also conducted surveillance for the first time during a second RSV season in a subset of children to assess the durability of the immune response. As previously demonstrated for all live attenuated RSV vaccines evaluated to date, there was no evidence of enhanced RSV disease in any vaccine recipient. Of the children with presumed RSV-MAARI, 50% of vaccines and 33% of placebo recipients had \u22651 additional respiratory virus isolated, so attribution remains unclear. We note that the rates of RSV-MAARI in this study and in our previous studies [10] [11] [12] were low compared with some population-based epidemiologic studies, probably because we purposefully selected children without medical risk factors for serious RSV disease for enrollment in these phase 1 studies.",

The antibody responses in the vaccinees were memory responses, whereas those in the placebo recipients generally were primary responses. These remarkably high memory responses are a consistent and important feature of recently evaluated live attenuated RSV vaccines [10] [11] [12] . Memory responses were also observed during the second season, indicating that priming is durable. During the second RSV surveillance season, mild RSVassociated LRI was observed in 1 vaccinee. Although an isolated event, this information suggests that it may be desirable to offer a booster dose of RSV/\u0394NS2/\u03941313/I1314L to protect during a second RSV season. Alternatively, the boost could consist of a PIV-vectored bivalent RSV/PIV vaccine [31] ; in animal studies, the replication and immunogenicity of PIV-vectored RSV vaccines was unaffected by RSV-specific immunity from a prior immunization. These possibilities could be evaluated in future vaccine trials.",

These desirable vaccine characteristics have also been noted for live attenuated RSV vaccine candidates bearing the M2-2 deletion ( [10] and unpublished data).
