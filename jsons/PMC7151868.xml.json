Some of these infections are latent, whereas others are the result of the occurrence of active infection in the donor at the time of procurement. All known types of infections have been recognized in transplant recipients. Three types of infection merit special attention. First, bacteremic or fungemic infections (staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Candida, Salmonella, Escherichia coli) in donors at the time of donation can selectively adhere to anastomotic sites (vascular, urinary) and may produce leaks or mycotic aneurysms. Second, some viral infections, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are associated with particular syndromes and morbidity in the immunocompromised population (see section on selected infections of importance). The greatest risk of these infections is to seronegative (immunologically naive) recipients who receive infected grafts from seropositive donors (latent viral infection). Third, late, latent infections, such as tuberculosis, may activate many years after the initial exposure. Such infections may be difficult to treat when established because of interactions between the antimicrobial agents used to treat them (e.g., rifampin, streptomycin, isoniazid for mycobacteria) and the agents used in immunosuppressive therapy.",

At present, routine evaluation of donors relies on antibody detection (serological) tests for common infections. As a result, some active infections remain undetected because seroconversion may not occur during acute infection. These limitations suggest that to achieve the benefits of transplantation, some organs are implanted carrying unidentified pathogens. This risk is exhibited by clusters of donor-derived Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas' disease), rabies virus, West Nile virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections in organ transplant recipients.",

Infection caused by common respiratory viruses (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus) and by more atypical pathogens (HSV, VZV) carries risk for viral pneumonia and increased risk for bacterial or fungal superinfection. Community (contact or transfusion associated) exposure to CMV and EBV may produce severe primary infection in the nonimmune host. Recent and remote exposures to endemic, geographically restricted systemic mycoses (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, and Histoplasma capsulatum) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can result in localized pulmonary, systemic, or metastatic infection. Asymptomatic Strongyloides stercoralis infection may activate more than 30 years after initial exposure owing to the effects of immunosuppressive therapy (Fig. 29-1\n). Such reactivation can result in either a diarrheal illness and parasite migration with hyperinfestation syndrome (characterized by hemorrhagic enterocolitis, hemorrhagic pneumonia, or both) or disseminated infection with accompanying (usually) gram-negative bacteremia or meningitis. Gastroenteritis secondary to Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and a variety of enteric viruses can result in persistent infection, with more severe and prolonged diarrheal disease and an increased risk of primary or secondary bloodstream invasion and metastatic infection.",

Universal prophylaxis involves giving antiviral therapy to all at-risk patients beginning at or immediately after transplantation for a defined period. In preemptive therapy, quantitative assays are used to monitor patients at predefined intervals to detect early disease. Positive assays result in therapy. Preemptive therapy incurs extra costs for monitoring and coordination of outpatient care, while reducing the cost of drugs and the inherent toxicities. Prophylaxis has the possible advantage of preventing not only CMV infection during the period of greatest risk but also diminishing infections secondary to HHV-6, HHV-7, and EBV. The indirect effects of CMV (i.e., graft rejection, opportunistic infection) also may be reduced by routine prophylaxis. In practice, neither universal prophylaxis nor preemptive therapy is perfect.

Mucocutaneous candidal infection (e.g., oral thrush, esophageal infection, cutaneous infection at intertriginous sites, candidal vaginitis) is most common in diabetics, with high-dose steroid therapy, and during broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. These infections are usually treatable through correction of the underlying metabolic abnormality and topical therapy with clotrimazole or nystatin. Thrush also may complicate viral (HSV, CMV) or toxic (drugs including mycophenolate mofetil) esophagitis. Optimal management of candidal infection occurring in association with the presence of vascular access catheters, surgical drains, and bladder catheters requires removal of the foreign body and systemic antifungal therapy with fluconazole or echinocandin.",

Initial treatment is probably best with liposomal amphotericin and flucytosine (after obtaining serum levels) followed by high-dose fluconazole until the cryptococcal antigen is cleared from blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

The level of serum lactate dehydrogenase is elevated in most patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia (>300 IU/mL). Many other diffuse pulmonary processes also increase serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, however. No diagnostic pattern exists for Pneumocystis pneumonia on routine chest radiograph. The chest radiograph may be entirely normal or develop the classic pattern of perihilar and interstitial ground-glass infiltrates. Chest CT scans are more sensitive to the diffuse interstitial and nodular pattern than routine radiographs. The clinical and radiological manifestations of P. carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia are virtually identical to the manifestations of CMV. The clinical challenge is to determine whether both pathogens are present. Significant extrapulmonary disease is uncommon in the transplant recipient. Bronchoalveolar lavage may be helpful.",

This reflects the elevation of creatinine owing to trimethoprim (competing for secretion in the kidney), and the toxicity of sulfa agents for the renal allograft. Hydration and the gradual initiation of therapy may help. Alternative therapies are less desirable but have been used with success, including intravenous pentamidine, atovaquone, clindamycin with primaquine or pyrimethamine, and trimetrexate. Although a reduction in the intensity of immunosuppression is generally considered a part of anti-infective therapy in transplantation, the use of short courses of adjunctive steroids with a gradual taper is generally useful.",
