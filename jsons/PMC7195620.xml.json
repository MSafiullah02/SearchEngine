According to the WTO (2018), some 287 RTAs are in force (as of 1 May 2018), corresponding to 459 notifications from World Trade Organisation (WTO) members. Studies of the trade effects of economic integration agreements (EIAs) most commonly include regional integration in Europe, mainly because the European Union (EU) represents the deepest and most durable RTA worldwide and its succession of enlargements provides the basis for continual study (Greenaway and Milner 2002).",

            "text": "Most studies of regional integration in Europe find a small, positive and significant effect of RTAs on trade although a neutral or even a negative effect also feature among the empirical findings. Using the gravity model framework, early studies tend to use cross sectional methods or a series of cross sections to assess the importance of regional integration whereas panel methods dominate more recent studies. Aitken (1973), for example, estimate the gravity model as a cross section for each year over the period 1951\u20131967; the trade effects for the dummy variables denoting the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are found to be consistent with theoretical predictions. In other words, the trade preference coefficients are initially negative and insignificant in the preintegration period, change sign during the integration phase and increase in magnitude with the progression of time, eventually becoming positive and significant. Continuing with the theme of estimating the trade effects of the EEC and EFTA dummies among the industrialised countries, Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1998) analyse successive cross sections for the later period, 1956\u20131992, to identify differences over time in the trade creating and trade diverting effects of European regionalism. The effect of European regional integration has also been examined across a range of panel estimators (Bussi\u00e8re et al. 2005; Stack 2009) while Cheng and Wall (2005) extend the sample size to consider the trade effects of additional regional blocks.",

(2018); Dhingra et al. (2017); Felbermayr et al. (2018). In effect, the data facilitate a quantitative trade model of the global economy, allowing for the channels through which trade affects consumers, firms and workers, thereby providing a map from trade to welfare analysis (Van Reenen 2016).3 In other strands of the literature, Kee and Nicita (2017) construct an overall trade restrictiveness index of the UK\u2019s major trading partners to analyse the short term effects of Brexit on goods trade. For a selection of EU and non EU trading partner countries, Douch et al. (2018) use a synthetic control method to analyse the effects of Brexit on UK bilateral trade. Various post Brexit trade policy scenarios have also been quantified using bilateral trade data that is inherent to the gravity model framework (HM Treasury 2016; Oberhofer and Pfaffermayr 2018).4",

In essence, the sample period includes actual data (1960\u20132016) and forecast data (2017\u20132022). The benefits of forward looking data are twofold. First, it allows for estimation of the trade effects of economic integration associated with recently formed trade agreements, for example, the trade agreement between the EU and Canada that came into effect in September 2017. Second, the trade effects of economic disintegration associated with the planned exit of the UK from the EU can also be estimated. In other words, the potential trade effects of Brexit coincide with the planned date of departure in contrast to the existing literature that conduct counterfactual trade policy scenarios on time scales before Brexit actually occurs.",

Distinct trade effects, however, are obtained when the EU trade related agreements are split according to the type of arrangement: positive, significant and of similar magnitude for EU membership and the FTAs, but negative and significant (and smaller in magnitude) for the regional EPAs. The mixed results for the trade policy effects largely depend on the degree of liberalisation and the concomitant reduction of tariff and non tariff barriers.",

On the other hand, trade with the rest of the world would rise by nearly a half. In aggregate, UK bilateral trade with all countries would decline by 6% and 13% under the hard Brexit and the hard Brexit plus scenarios respectively, but these losses would be partially offset by the global Britain strategy (5%). The global Britain strategy, however, comes with major caveats. From the EU\u2019s perspective, only minor percentage changes in bilateral trade are predicted under all three scenarios, suggesting an asymmetry of effect.",

The inclusion of infrastructure in a model of trade stems from Bougheas et al. (1999), who suggested that the level of infrastructure can affect trade via its influence on transport costs. They argue that transport costs are not only a function of distance, but also depend on the availability of public infrastructure such as roads, ports and telecommunication networks. Therefore, they augment the gravity model with direct measures of transport infrastructure, including the length of the motorway network. As trade depends inversely on transport costs and transport costs depend inversely on infrastructure, a positive relationship between the level of infrastructure and the volume of trade is predicted. Along these lines, Francois and Manchin (2013) assess the trade effect of both physical (air transport and roads) and communications infrastructure while Carr\u00e8re (2006) quantifies the trade effect of infrastructure by constructing an index based on four variables (road density, roads paved, railways and telephone lines). Accordingly, Eq. (2) includes two measures of physical infrastructure, namely the log of the summed value of air freight, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\ln AIR_{ij}^{t}$$\\end{document}lnAIRijt, and similarly for rail lines, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\ln RAIL_{ij}^{t}$$\\end{document}lnRAILijt.

During the third subperiod (1989\u20132016), the late 1980s ushered in an economic downturn affecting much of the western world. During the fourth and most recent subperiod (2007\u20132016), the global financial crisis and the ensuing debt crisis plunged the world economy into its worst recession since the 1930s. This phase also includes a general slowdown in 2014\u20132015 linked to China\u2019s decelerating growth and falling commodity prices. The June 2016 referendum to withdraw the UK from the EU also occurred during this time frame with potentially far reaching consequences into the future. Looking ahead, the final subperiod (2017\u20132022) based on forecast data is helpful towards analysing the trade effects of economic integration associated with recently formed trade agreements as well as economic disintegration associated with the planned exit of the UK from the EU.",

In other words, earlier membership of EIAs came with greater trade benefits, helped by the signing of the 1986 Single European Act that created the Single Market, culminating in the \u2018four freedoms\u2019 relating to goods, services, people and money across EU borders. Indeed, by the fourth subperiod the beneficial effects of EIA membership have dwindled away into insignificance, likely reflecting the fallout of the global financial crisis, its aftermath and the debt crisis in Europe, all of which brought about sharply declining growth of GDP and lower demand for imports. The forecast subperiod, however, suggests a rebound in the trade effect of EU membership, probably linked to the growing importance of intra industry trade and the exchange of similar, but differentiated goods, as suggested by the rising magnitude of the GDP per capita difference coefficient. In contrast, the prospective trade effects of FTAs and the regional EPAs are subdued and even adversarial.",

The downside of land borders decreases into insignificance in contrast to landlocked countries, which face substantial constraints in the forecast subperiod. The gains from colonial linkages have weakened since the 1960s, when many countries gained independence, consistent with the findings of Head et al. (2010). Similarly, the effects of cultural heritage have eroded over time. Finally, the coefficients for infrastructure are broadly stable, except for the fourth subperiod when belt tightening during the financial crisis favoured cheaper transport modes, including railways, over the speedier, but more costly mode of air transport. As the economy recovers from the financial crisis, the logistics industry looks set to return to the more normal mix of transport modes.",

The results for the global Britain strategy also come with major caveats. What is clear is that a clean break with the EU\u2019s single market and customs union is made difficult by more than 45 years of EU membership and intertwined regulatory and institutional practices. In the end, the choice comes down to the degree to which Britain aligns itself with the EU; closer to the EU akin to Norway plus (adding a customs union to membership of the single market); farther away based on the EU\u2019s deal with Canada; or something in between modelled on the EU\u2019s deep and comprehensive FTA with Ukraine, which would allow access to the single market, allow new deals with third countries and end free movement of people. There is a large range of existing trade deals from which a template can be drawn!",

The three more recent rounds of enlargement encompassing 13 new member states (NMS) include 10 countries that joined in 2004 (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia), followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 and Croatia in 2013 bThe ongoing conflict in Syria has led to the suspension of trade in some industries (crude oil, petroleum products, gold, precious metals and diamonds) cThe provisional application of the agreement with Colombia and Peru began on 1 March 2013 and with Ecuador on 1 January 2017. Bolivia, also a member of the Andean Community, has the option to join the agreement in the future dThe Association Agreement entails three pillars, namely trade, cooperation and political dialogue with six Central American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.
