They often encounter patients infected with dangerous communicable diseases, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Neisseria meningitis, hepatitis B and C, HIV, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. To be prepared to safely manage such patients, paramedics and emergency medical technicians are trained, as part of their core curriculum, to implement standard and transmission-based precautions to prevent exposure to themselves or others. Across the United States, EMS transports of such patients occur regularly. However, the transport of the first patient with confirmed Ebola virus disease to the United States (Atlanta, GA), the transport of the first US-diagnosed Ebola virus disease case (Dallas, TX), and the first transmission of Ebola virus disease to health care workers in the United States understandably raised anxiety in the EMS community about the appropriate education and training, policies, and procedures, as well as supervision required, to be best prepared for transporting patients with serious communicable disease in the United States.",

This partnership included Grady EMS for the development of a team with the requisite competencies necessary to transport and manage these patients in the out-of-hospital setting. In 2005, the University of Nebraska developed isolation capability for serious communicable diseases and initiated partnerships with EMS professionals to provide safe transport and management of patients admitted to the facility. The objectives of these hospital and out-of-hospital collaborations were to close education, training, and practice gaps to best facilitate the care for patients with serious communicable disease while ensuring the safety of the medics and the general public through meticulous implementation of infection control practices as recommended by CDC. The description of practices implemented by EMS teams in these communities for the transport of patients with confirmed Ebola virus disease is shared so that others might more readily implement these practices, policies, and procedures as applicable to their mission requirements and system design. A discussion about evaluation and transport of patients with relevant travel history and development of illness is also included.",

For example, a cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome cases among protected health care workers in 2003 raised questions about health care worker familiarity with how best to remove personal protective equipment (PPE) without contaminating themselves.9 Developing and maintaining a high level of competency with the use of PPE is vital for workforce safety.10\n",

They do this by separating the driver compartment from the passenger compartment such that the driver compartment is always considered clean. Medics who have made patient contact do not return to the driver compartment. The ventilation system in the driver compartment is turned on, with the fan set on high and in such a way as to not allow recirculation of air. The intent is to create a positive-pressure environment in the driver compartment to guard against aerosol. Although Ebola is known to be transmitted by direct contact with blood or infectious bodily fluids or droplets and not by aerosol, this simple technique is implemented as an extra measure of caution should an aerosol-producing procedure be required in the patient compartment. CDC has previously recommended this technique for the ground transportation of patients who pose a risk of disease transmission by aerosol.11\n",

The transport team met the CDC\u2019s standard by wearing a footed Tyvek (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) suit, gloves, and a hooded, powered, air-purifying respirator for eye and mucous membrane protection. We recognized that goggles and a surgical mask technically meet the requirement for mucous membrane protection from droplets and that the hooded, powered, air-purifying respirator was not strictly required. During years of operational experience in our work environment, however, the team found the hooded, powered, air-purifying respirator cooler and more comfortable to use, especially on an extended mission. The device also averted any issues with eyewear fogging and protected health care providers from inadvertent touching of the face. The Tyvek suit and hooded, powered, air-purifying respirator also afford excellent splash protection, a very important consideration when managing a patient in an ambulance compartment where vomit, diarrhea, and blood pose a serious risk of exposure. Our patients were all several days into the course of their Ebola virus disease illness, a time when episodic emesis and profound diarrhea are reported.12 And should the patient suddenly require an aerosol-producing procedure, such as open suctioning to prevent aspiration or emergency intubation, the medic is already afforded the appropriate respiratory protection. A properly fitted air-purifying respirator has also been successfully used. Other PPE ensembles that prevent exposure to skin and mucous membranes will also be effective if used properly. Selection of PPE should be in accordance with CDC guidelines and accommodate the condition of the patient, the anticipated mission requirements, and the work environment and be in concert with the requisite competencies to properly use the equipment.",

The team leader and EMS physician support the mission by managing communications and logistics with involved agencies (which may include law enforcement, airport operations, public health, and emergency management), managing safety, and providing clinical decisionmaking and direct medical control when required.

The authors also have experience transporting patients who meet criteria for persons under investigation, and in these cases, a patient evaluation assists in selecting the appropriate procedures and PPE ensemble to provide for the safety of the transport team. With the assistance of public health officials, a history is obtained to determine what risk the patient has for exposure to Ebola virus disease.14 The risk may be high, as in the case of a needle stick from a needle contaminated with the blood of a confirmed Ebola patient, or low, as in the case of a patient who has traveled in a country with widespread Ebola activity, but without a known exposure. This epidemiologic assessment is then complemented by an assessment of the patient\u2019s clinical condition and the risk that the health care worker could be exposed to bodily fluids. If the patient simply has fever, has no evidence of vomiting or diarrhea, and is lucid and conversational (the \u201cdry\u201d patient), the medic is considered to be at less risk for exposure to bodily fluids. In contrast, the patient with active vomiting and diarrhea (the \u201cwet\u201d patient) poses a greater risk of transmission to the medic simply because there is greater risk of exposure to infectious bodily fluid. For patients who pose a limited risk for exposure to bodily fluids, the selected PPE is less onerous. Medics apply 2 pairs of gloves, an impermeable gown, and a face shield or surgical mask and goggles for protection of mucous membranes. For patients posing a greater risk of exposure, a more protective PPE ensemble, as previously described, is recommended.15 The selection of PPE for the transporting EMS team is determined by assessment of patient condition and risk of exposure to bodily fluids.",

It may further reassure medics to know that travelers from Ebola-affected countries who develop generalized signs of illness are still more likely to have malaria, acute diarrheal illness, or other infectious disease than they are to have Ebola virus disease.17 While this indicates a need for timely patient evaluation, it should also put in context the risk posed to EMS by these patients.
