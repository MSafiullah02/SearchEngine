This indicates that HAV infection may play a role in the decline of cognitive function or persons with lower cognitive performance may have increased risk for HAV infection. In our study, we have such strength as using a large national representative sample and comprehensive consideration of covariates. Several reports previously investigated the prevalence of HAV infection among people with intellectual disability. Williamson and colleagues ( 24 ) reported that the prevalence of HAV antibody in residents of institutions for intellectual disability was higher than that in the general population. Poovorawan and colleagues ( 25 ) demonstrated a high prevalence (92%) of HAV antibody among the young residents in the Institute for the Mentally Handicapped. These reports were in line with the negative association between HAV infection and cognitive function; however, they had weakness in terms of small sample size and external validity. Participants of the previous reports were confi ned to small groups of intellectual disabled patients. Moreover, no cognitive test was administered in any of the studies.

Possible explainable factors include lifestyle, environment, infl ammatory, and immunologic effects of HAV infection on brain damage and cooccurred complications of acute HAV infection. With regard to lifestyle and environmental factors, HAV-seropositive participants in our study tended to live in a poorer environment and pay less attention to health on the account of lower education level, lower annual family income, lower level of folate, and less exercise activity. We did not adjust for other factors associated with poor environment and unhealthy behavior, such as lead poisoning or illicit drug use. In aspects of comorbidities, we observed a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus in HAV-seropositive participants, whereas no signifi cant differences in cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Indeed, neither biologic fi ndings in the atheromatous plaque ( 26 ) nor longitudinal reports from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation studies ( 27 ) supported the notion that exposure to HAV might be associated with an excess risk for atherosclerosis or cardiovascular events. In contrast, because the majority of the diabetic participants in our study were affected with type 2 diabetes, a high prevalence of HAV seropositivity among the diabetic elders implies a possible interplay between HAV infection and type 2 diabetes. Wang and colleagues ( 28 ) recently reported a related fi nding that HCV infection was an independent predictor of type 2 diabetes. Although the mechanistic relationship between HAV infection and cognitive dysfunction is still unclear, direct demyelination and disruption in tryptophan metabolism were implicated in HCV-infected patients with neurological or psychological manifestations ( 29 -31 ) .
