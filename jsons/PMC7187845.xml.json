Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While affecting dominantly respiratory system, COVID-19 may also cause acute and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Cardiac conditions can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 or can be complications of any other pathology with higher cardio-metabolic demand. We present a 78-year-old man with acute respiratory distress and ST segment elevation on electrocardiography, who was subsequently diagnosed as COVID-19 related myocarditis.",

Upon developing acute respiratory distress in a short time, he was intubated and connected to the mechanical ventilator. No acute pathology or COVID-19 related findings were detected in the thorax computerized tomography (CT). Upon detecting ST segment elevation on electrocardiography (ECG), the patient was transferred to our emergency department. In our hospital, a 12-lead ECG showed atrial fibrillation with 150 beat/min and concave ST elevation except for aVR lead (Fig. 1A). Troponin T level was 998.1 (0\u201314) ng/L and CRP was 94.6 mg/L (<5). Hemogram analysis revealed leukocytosis and lymphopenia. Coronary angiography was performed after all safety precautions were taken due to COVID-19 Pandemic. No significant pathology was detected on the coronary arteries (Fig. 1B\u2013D). Based on the clinical history and the COVID-19 outbreak, COVID-19 was deemed as likely and thorax CT was taken again. It showed ground glass opacification with consolidation (especially right lower lobe) in the lungs (Fig. 1E, F) associated with COVID-19. Bilateral lower lob subsegmental atelectasis and mild pericardial effusion were also detected (Fig. 1G). Furosemide, beta-blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was added to his COVID specific therapy. After performing coronary angiography and seeing that it was normal, patient was transferred to pandemic hospitalization center where he was hospitalized at first.",

Myocarditis is generally suspected in patients with clinical evidence suggesting an acute coronary syndrome on ECG or laboratory testing and/or evidence of wall motion abnormalities with nonobstructive coronary arteries on coronary angiography. Patient, in our case, presented with sudden onset of cardiorespiratory distress, symptoms of viral infection, ST elevation on ECG, elevation of cardiac biomarkers and normal coronary artery indicating myocardial injury. The pericardial effusion on CT supported the diagnosis of pericarditis component. Not being able to perform echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to precautions taken for COVID-19 is limitation of our case.",
