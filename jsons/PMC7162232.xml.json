Most significantly, it has dramatically expanded the number of proteins that can be investigated both biochemically and structurally. Previously, protein production was the domain of experts, as purification from a natural source (i.e., plants, rabbits, bovine) was often difficult and time consuming. However, the availability of new commercial systems for recombinant protein expression, combined with advanced protein purification techniques, has made protein production prevalent throughout the biological and biomedical sciences. This has enabled the research community to study thousands of low abundance and novel proteins from a large variety of organisms. Notably, 31 recombinant proteins were approved for therapeutic use between 2003 and 2006, highlighting the importance of heterologous protein expression in biopharmaceutical research (Walsh, 2006). As the number of recombinantly produced proteins increases, so too does an appreciation for the difficulties and limitations inherent to this process.",

The rationale is clear: \nE. coli\n is easy to genetically manipulate, it is inexpensive to culture, and expression is fast, with proteins routinely produced in one day. Moreover, protocols for isotope\u2010labeling for NMR spectroscopy and selenomethionine incorporation for X\u2010ray crystallography are well established, making it highly suitable for structural studies.

In contrast to eukaryotic systems, transcription and translation are fast and tightly coupled. Since many eukaryotic proteins require longer times and/or the assistance of folding chaperones to fold into their native state, this rate enhancement often leads to a pool of partially folded, unfolded, or misfolded, insoluble proteins (Oberg et al., 1994). Thus, some targets, especially larger multidomain and membrane proteins, either fail to express in \nE. coli\n or express insolubly as inclusion bodies. Moreover, insolubility is not just restricted to heterologous proteins, as many bacterial proteins also cannot be produced in soluble form when overexpressed in \nE. coli\n (Vincentelli et al., 2003). In addition, the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm makes the efficient production of disulfide\u2010containing proteins challenging (Stewart et al., 1998; Ritz and Beckwith, 2001). Finally, \nE. coli\n lacks the machinery required to perform certain eukaryotic post\u2010translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can be critical for the formation of folded, active protein (Zhang et al., 2004).",

A remarkable number of novel reagents (new vectors, new host strains) and strategies (chaperone co\u2010expression, low temperature induction) have been developed that allow many of these disadvantages to be readily and successfully overcome. It is this topic, how to optimize soluble protein expression in \nE. coli\n, that is the focus of this review. Section I outlines a typical expression protocol for the production of heterologous proteins in \nE. coli\n. While this protocol has proven highly successful for a broad range of targets, every protein has its own unique set of biophysical characteristics that often requires protocol changes in order to successfully express the target. Thus, in the second part of this review, critical parameters that are essential to consider when designing a protein expression strategy are highlighted (Fig. 1). These parameters have the common goal of maximizing the yield of soluble, active protein. Section II describes optimization of the target DNA, section III discusses modifications for the optimization of expression vectors, section IV details bacterial host strains that aid heterologous protein expression, section V outlines optimization of protein expression conditions, and section VI describes how to enhance soluble expression by coexpression with other proteins.",

Does the final product need to be active? Is the native protein conformation important? In some instances, such as antibody production, the production of soluble protein is not necessary, as the protein sequence, rather than the correct 3\u2010dimensional fold, is required for successful antibody production (Yan et al., 2007). For these cases, expression that causes the protein to be incorporated into inclusion bodies is suggested, as the recombinant protein, while misfolded or unfolded, is highly enriched and protected from proteases (Valax and Georgiou, 1993).

With each selection affecting the solubility and activity of the protein product, this task can appear daunting.

The target gene is then subcloned into a bacterial expression vector that utilizes the T7 lacO promoter system (i.e., that used in the pET system) and contains both an N\u2010terminal hexahistadine (his6)\u2010tag and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site (Peti and Page, 2007). The T7 promoter system provides strong, robust expression, the his6\u2010tag facilitates purification, while the protease site allows the (his6)\u2010tag to be proteolytically removed from the purified target protein. In the third step, the expression vector is transformed into a derivative of the BL21 (DE3) strain, such as BL21 (DE3)\u2010RIL cells. These cells, which are compatible with the T7 promoter system, contain plasmids that encode arginine, isoleucine, and leucine tRNAs that are rare in \nE. coli\n, and are deficient in both lon and ompT proteases, which minimizes in vivo degradation of the target protein. After the overnight starter culture is used to inoculate the large\u2010scale culture (step 5), the cells are grown to mid\u2010log phase (OD600 of \u223c0.6 to 0.9) in Luria broth (LB) in baffled shaker flasks (which increases aeration and thus yield) at 37\u00b0C with constant shaking. The cultures are then transferred to a lower temperature (18\u00b0C), and, once cooled, protein expression is induced using isopropyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010thio\u2010galactoside (IPTG). Expression is continued overnight with vigorous shaking (200 to 250 rpm) at 18\u00b0C. The lower expression temperature facilitates the production of folded, soluble protein. Finally, the cells are pelleted by centrifugation and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.",

Many proteins, especially human proteins, have mRNA sequences that include codons that are infrequently used in \nE. coli\n (rare codons) (Sharp and Li, 1987). This includes codons for arginine (AGA, AGG), isoleucine (AUA), leucine (CUA), and proline (CCC). Target genes that contain significant numbers of individual rare codons, or smaller numbers of tandem rare codons, are more likely to experience translational stalling in \nE. coli\n, and thus often either completely fail to express, express at very low levels, or are expressed as truncated proteins (Kane, 1995, Cruz\u2010Vera et al., 2004). Moreover, when they do express, these rare codon\u2013rich genes can also be incorrectly translated, as high level misincorporation of lysine for arginine at AGA codons has been observed for protein targets expressed in \nE. coli\n (Calderone et al., 1996).",

            "text": "Fortunately, the codon bias of \nE. coli\n is straightforward to overcome. Multiple Web sites are now available that quantify the number and the location of rare codons in a gene (e.g., the rare codon calculator, RaCC; http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/RACC/). These programs also often highlight the number of consecutive rare codons. If the target protein contains a significant number of rare codons, especially tandem rare codons, two approaches can be taken. In the first, changes are made to the gene. Specifically, the gene is \u201ccodon optimized,\u201d i.e., the rare codons are replaced with those that are common to the host. This can be achieved using site\u2010directed mutagenesis. However, it is often faster and cheaper to simply have the codon\u2010optimized gene synthesized (this service is offered by multiple companies). Gene synthesis has the added benefit that most gene optimization algorithms optimize not only rare codons, but also mRNA secondary structure, which has also been shown to affect translation efficiency (Hatfield and Roth, 2007). In the second approach, changes are made to the expression host. Namely, genes encoding the rare tRNAs are co\u2010expressed with the wild\u2010type (non\u2010optimized) target gene (Wakagi et al., 1998). \nE. coli\n strains are now available that contain plasmids that encode rare tRNAs [i.e., BL21 (DE3)\u2010RIL/RP/RILP cells from Stratagene or Rosetta cells from Novagen; Schenk et al., 1995; Tegel et al., 2009].",

Critically, recent large\u2010scale, comparative studies have shown that, for most targets, either approach is equally effective (Burgess\u2010Brown et al., 2008). Thus, many research groups, including those of structural genomics consortia, protein production facilities, and the authors (see the standard protocol in Fig. 2), use codon\u2010supplemented cells for all initial expression trials.",

This increase in size is due to an increase in the number of complex, multidomain proteins, in which individual domains have distinct and independent functions. Comparative studies have shown that the probability of soluble expression in \nE. coli\n decreases with increasing molecular weight, especially for proteins >60 kD (Canaves et al., 2004, Goh et al., 2004, Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008a). For example, a large\u2010scale study examining the protein properties of 95 recombinantly expressed mammalian proteins found that smaller proteins (average molecular weight of 22.8 kD) were often expressed solubly alone, while larger proteins (average molecular weight of 40.4 kD) were only solubly expressed when fused to solubility\u2010enhancing tags (Dyson et al., 2004). In a separate study, small proteins (100 amino acids or less) were expressed solubly in \nE. coli\n at levels suitable for purification 47% of the time, while large proteins (600 to 800 amino acids) were expressed solubly only 33% of the time (Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008a).

(2008) showed that deletion of just four residues at either the N\u2010 or C\u2010terminus can convert a solubly expressing protein into one that expresses insolubly. In a separate study, Gr\u00e5slund et al. (2008b) generated 10 constructs of a single target domain of interest: full\u2010length and 9 deletion constructs that differed in length from one another by 2 to 10 residues at either the N\u2010 or C\u2010terminus. Thus, all available functional and structural data should be used to determine optimal boundaries for a protein domain construct. For a protein of unknown domain structure, threading the target protein sequence onto a homologous protein structure (i.e., SWISS\u2010MODEL; Arnold et al., 2006) or using structure\u2010based/fold recognition sequence alignment programs (i.e., FFAS; Jaroszewski et al., 2005) can aid in determining the optimal domain boundaries. When a homologous protein structure is not available, the prediction of secondary structural elements (i.e., PSIPRED; Jones, 1999) should be utilized. The disruption of predicted secondary structural elements must be avoided. Many of the bioinformatics tools needed to carry out these types of analyses are freely available at http://www.expasy.org. In addition, a program has been developed that integrates these bioinformatics tools to aid in protein boundary identification (the SGC Domain Boundary Analyzer; described in more detail in Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008b). Finally, it is typically advantageous to subclone four or more constructs with different N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal boundaries and test, in parallel, which construct results in the highest level of soluble expression (Brown et al., 2008).",

In addition to molecular weight, other biophysical properties of the protein, such as hydrophobicity and sequence complexity, can influence expression yields. In the study by Dyson et al. (2004), 95 mammalian proteins were fused to a variety of N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal expression and purification tags in order to elucidate the properties of the proteins and fusion tags that facilitate soluble expression. They determined that contiguous hydrophobic residues (AILFWV) and low complexity regions (LCRs) negatively correlate with soluble expression. LCRs are regions of biased sequence composition, such as homopolymeric runs, short\u2010period repeats, and overrepresentations of one or a few residues that typically adopt disordered coil conformations (DePristo et al., 2006). This has also been reported by other groups (Canaves et al., 2004; Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008a). Thus, it is common to design protein expression constructs to avoid hydrophobic residues and low complexity segments in the extreme N\u2010 and C\u2010termini (Peti and Page, 2007). However, LCRs do not always inhibit soluble expression. Many intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs; proteins that do not adopt a single folded conformation yet are still biologically active) contain LCRs, yet have been robustly and solubly expressed in \nE. coli\n (Dyson and Wright, 2005; Dancheck et al., 2008). Because LCRs may play an active role in mediating protein function or protein\u2010protein interactions (Karlin et al., 2002), their inclusion in an expression protein construct must be determined on a protein\u2010by\u2010protein basis.",

When refolding conditions cannot be successfully identified, the target protein must be produced solubly in vivo.

This sequence contains the transcription start site, as well as two hexanucleotide sequences approximately 10 and 35 bases upstream of the initiation site that direct the binding of essential elements of the polymerase machinery (Rosenberg and Court, 1979; Hawley and McClure, 1983; Harley and Reynolds, 1987). An effective promoter for expressing heterologous proteins in \nE. coli\n has three characteristic features.

Gene expression is driven by the T7 RNA polymerase (from the T7 bacteriophage), which transcribes DNA five times faster than the bacterial RNA polymerase (Studier et al., 1990). Because \nE. coli\n lacks this enzyme, the polymerase must be delivered to the cell, via an inducible plasmid or, more often, by using an \nE. coli\n strain that contains a chromosomal copy of the T7 polymerase gene (Studier and Moffatt, 1986b). In the absence of an inducer, the polymerase, which itself is under the control of the lacUV5 promoter, is not produced, and correspondingly, the gene of interest is not transcribed (Studier et al., 1990). Upon addition of the nonhydrolyzable lactose analog, IPTG, the T7 RNA polymerase is transcribed and synthesized.

However, such robust transcription can have undesirable effects. First, even minimal basal production of T7 RNA polymerase results in \u201cleaky\u201d expression (expression prior to induction) of the target protein (Moffatt and Studier, 1987). This can be detrimental if the protein is toxic to the host, resulting in cell death or growth arrest. To minimize leaky expression, several host strains [i.e., BL21(DE3)pLysS, Rosetta(DE3)pLysS, Rosetta\u2010gami(DE3)pLysS] have been developed that contain a plasmid encoding T7 lysozyme, an enzyme that binds and inhibits T7 polymerase (Moffatt and Studier, 1987). The concentrations of T7 lysozyme produced in these strains are sufficient to inhibit basal transcription of target genes. However, it continues to inhibit T7 RNA polymerase after expression has been induced, and thus, it is typical for the level of recombinant protein expression to be significantly reduced in pLysS versus non\u2010pLysS strains. For nontoxic proteins, this results in lower yields (Studier, 1991). However, for toxic proteins, this often results in higher yields because the cell growth is not arrested prior to induction by the premature expression of the toxic protein (Yeo et al., 2009). In addition, because T7 is such a strong promoter, some translated proteins aggregate and form inclusion bodies because they fail to fold before encountering another unfolded protein. In these cases, expression parameters can be changed (see section IV) to maximize the yield of soluble, folded protein. Alternatively, a weaker promoter can be used.",

Thus, it is advantageous for the expression of highly toxic proteins. The induction agent for this promoter is l\u2010arabinose (Lee et al., 1987). In the absence of l\u2010arabinose, transcription is exceptionally low and, if needed, can be even further suppressed by the addition of glucose (Miyada et al., 1984). As reported by Guzman et al., protein expression levels increase linearly with increasing concentrations of l\u2010arabinose over two logarithms (Guzman et al., 1995). This allows the expression level to be titrated over a wide range of inducer concentrations, which can be important when trying to either maximize expression yields (higher l\u2010arabinose concentrations) or to increase the yield of soluble protein (lower l\u2010arabinose concentrations). It should be noted that although this system can efficiently repress gene expression, the repression level is not always zero and the efficiency of repression is gene dependent (Guzman et al., 1995). Finally, studies that have directly compared protein yields from the araBAD and the T7 promoters have found that T7 promoters generally result in higher expression yields (Goulding and Perry, 2003). For example, in our hands, we have seen protein expression yields increase by 2\u2010 to as much as 10\u2010fold by switching from the araBAD to the T7 promoter system.",

After 90 min, the major cold\u2010shock protein, CspA, accounts for 13% of total cellular protein (Goldstein et al., 1990). Accordingly, the cspA promoter has been exploited to direct the expression of recombinant proteins at low temperatures. For this system, induction is achieved by simply changing the growth temperature of the bacterial culture from 37\u00b0C to between 10\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C (Vasina and Baneyx, 1996); no chemical inductant is required. Moreover, because expression is carried out at low temperatures, this system has the added benefit that it promotes the soluble expression of aggregation\u2010prone proteins (Vasina and Baneyx, 1996, 1997). One drawback is that the cold shock promoter is not completely repressed at higher temperatures, which can result in basal expression of the target protein (Qing et al., 2004).

In this system, the MBP fusion protein is proteolytically cleaved in vivo by the co\u2010expressed protease (Nallamsetty and Waugh, 2006).

One of the advantages of SUMO is that it is small (11.2 kD).

It cleaves the peptide chain immediately after the C\u2010terminal residue of the SUMO protein.

However, N\u2010terminal fusions are the most common and have the added benefit that they often enhance soluble protein expression more successfully than C\u2010terminal fusions (Sati et al., 2002; Dyson et al., 2004; Busso et al., 2005). One of the reasons N\u2010 versus C\u2010terminally fused tags effectively improve protein expression and solubility is because many of the fusion tags are native \nE. coli\n proteins. Thus, they provide an efficient 5\u2032 sequence for the initiation of transcription (Esposito and Chatterjee, 2006). Correspondingly, the N\u2010terminal mRNA sequence and structure is efficiently recognized by the ribosome and compatible with robust translation (Cebe and Geiser, 2006). In contrast, the transcription and translation initiation sites of target genes and proteins are variable and can impede these processes when tags are fused to the target protein C\u2010terminus. Notably, there are exceptions, as MBP and SET tags have been shown to be equally effective in enhancing solubility regardless of which terminus they are fused to (Dyson et al., 2004; Zhang, Y.B. et al., 2004), although this is still protein dependent. One tag that is often fused to the protein C\u2010terminus is the his6\u2010tag. Typically, it is equally effective at either location, but has the advantage that when fused to the C\u2010terminus, only fully translated proteins are purified as incompletely translated target proteins do not include the purification tag.",

Today, one of the most widely used proteases is tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. It has a number of advantages. First, it is more stringent and thus efficiently cleaves fusion tags without nonspecific secondary cleavage (Phan et al., 2002). Second, it can accommodate a number of different residues on the C\u2010terminal side of the sessile bond, eliminating nonnative residues on the N\u2010terminus of the target protein (Kapust et al., 2002). TEV protease is also active over a diverse set of experimental conditions, such as pH, buffers, and temperatures (Kapust et al., 2001, 2002). A disadvantage is that TEV protease is inhibited by a large number of detergents, making the removal of fusion tags from integral membrane proteins, which require protein\u2010detergent complexes for solubilization, challenging (Mohanty et al., 2003). If detergents are an essential component of the protein buffer, thrombin protease, which retains its activity in a wide range of detergents, can be used to cleave the fusion tag.",

Additionally, decreasing the concentration of IPTG can also enhance the production of soluble protein. For example, the solubility of recombinant cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase) was shown to be highly sensitive to the concentration of the inducer. When the protein was induced using 0.05 mM IPTG, the protein was soluble and active; however, when the inducer concentration was doubled to 0.1 mM the expressed protein was insoluble and inactive (Turner et al., 2005). Thus, although the most common IPTG concentrations for protein induction range from 0.1 to 1.0 mM, a decrease to even lower levels can effect solubility. Finally, a derivative of the BL21 (DE3) expression strain, containing a lacY1 deletion mutation, has been developed that allows the T7 promoter system to be titratable over a range of IPTG concentrations (Turner et al., 2005).

Both groups are folding chaperones that bind to solvent\u2010exposed hydrophobic domains, preventing nascent peptide aggregation, and through iterative rounds of ATP\u2010driven conformational changes, mediate the folding/unfolding of their substrates (for an extensive review of cytosolic molecular chaperones see Hartl and Hayer\u2010Hartl, 2002). While the soluble expression of certain proteins is improved by coexpression with DnaK\u2010DnaJ\u2010GrpE (Chen et al., 2003), other proteins result in higher yields of soluble protein when coexpressed with GroEL\u2010GroES (Ayling and Baneyx, 1996; Park et al., 2004; Sahu et al., 2009). Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict which, if any, molecular chaperone system will improve protein solubility. Due to the reduced metabolic burden, it is recommended to test protein expression with the two chaperone systems separately (for a thorough coexpression protocol see Baneyx and Palumbo, 2003).",

To ensure ample chaperones are available to aid protein folding at the start of recombinant protein production, GroEL and GroES expression, which is under the control of the araBAD promoter (induced with l\u2010arabinose), is induced at a culture optical density of \u03bb600 = 0.5, while PP1\u03b1, which is under the control of the T7 promoter (induced with IPTG), is induced later, at a culture optical density of \u03bb600 = 1.0. After 20 hr (10\u00b0C), the cultivated cells are pelleted and then resuspended in fresh medium that contains 200 \u00b5g/ml chloroamphenical to block all ribosome activity and the cultures are allowed to shake for an additional 2 hr. This last step allows for in vivo refolding and results in a substantial increase in the amount of folded, active PP1\u03b1 (Kelker et al., 2009).",

For example, while GroEL/GroES is most efficient at 30\u00b0C, this system is only 30% active at 12\u00b0C. As discussed throughout the review, there are extensive advantages to expressing recombinant proteins at low temperatures. A second system is available that is maximally functional at low temperatures: the cold\u2010adapted chaperonins Cpn10 and Cpn60 from psychrophilic bacterium, Oleispira antarctica. These chaperonins, which have 74% and 54% amino acid identity with GroEL and GroES, respectively, are effective folding\u2010modulators at low temperatures (4\u00b0C to 12\u00b0C) (Amada et al., 1995). Using this system, a temperature\u2010sensitive esterase expressed at 10\u00b0C with Cpn10 and Cpn60 exhibited a 180\u2010fold increase in activity over expression at 37\u00b0C (Ferrer et al., 2004). A derivative of the BL21 host strain, ArcticExpress (Stratagene), that coexpresses these two chaperonins, has been developed and used to successfully express several proteins, including interleukin\u20102 tyrosine kinase (Joseph and Andreotti, 2008).",

Accordingly, it is often necessary to vary one or many elements in the expression protocol to successfully express soluble protein (Fig. 3). This can mean testing scores of expression protocols, which is time consuming and costly. Thus, it is advantageous to use small\u2010scale expression tests to select an optimal construct and expression conditions prior to scaling up. The microexpression protocol used in our laboratory to determine expression, as well as protein solubility, has been explicitly described (Peti and Page, 2007). It is recommended to use this strategy to determine an optimal protocol for large\u2010scale expression. Be aware that results from small\u2010scale growths do not always translate to large\u2010scale systems. While positive small\u2010scale results can usually be reproduced in large\u2010scale studies, proteins that appear to have low or insoluble expression on a small\u2010scale may be expressed in soluble form when grown on a larger scale (Gr\u00e5slund et al., 2008a).",

For example, five years were devoted to identifying the optimal expression and purification protocol for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1\u03b1) (Kelker et al., 2009). This optimized protocol includes coexpressing PP1\u03b1 with molecular chaperones, supplementing the cultivation medium with metals, growing the culture and inducing protein expression at low temperatures, using low concentrations of inductants, and cleaving the fusion tag after the protein has been stabilized by a PP1\u03b1 ligand (either an inhibitor or a PP1\u03b1 binding protein). While time\u2010consuming, the high yields of soluble, active PP1\u03b1 have been essential for the successful completion of multiple projects (Dancheck et al., 2008, Kelker et al., 2009); thus, the effort devoted to determining the optimal protocol was invaluable.",
