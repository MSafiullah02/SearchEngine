Although most deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, malaria remains a significant health problem throughout most of South-East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the South Pacific region and Latin America. With an effective vaccine still a distant prospect, chemotherapeutic measures are the mainstay of defense against malaria. The combination of a limited choice of effective antimalarials and the relentless development of parasitic drug resistance means that it is crucial that the right choices are made when new drugs are selected and that these drugs are introduced into the field in a way that prolongs their therapeutic life.",

For example, in 1961, the WHO supplied 84,000 tons of CQ to Brazil alone for inclusion in table salt [6]. Shortly afterwards, the first cases of CQ-resistant P. falciparum were reported from the areas where the chloroquinized salt had been made available. CQ resistance has now reached all malaria-endemic regions of the world [7,8]. It retains some efficacy in semi-immune adults but much less in children who have not had enough time to develop immunity. Resistance to CQ is now also becoming a problem in the case of Plasmodium vivax [9,10]. The loss of CQ as an effective antimalarial has contributed to a doubling of malaria-related morbidity and mortality over the last two decades [11]. The effectiveness of CQ has now declined to the point where it is no longer the WHO-recommended treatment and has been officially abandoned in most countries. Nonetheless, newer drugs are too expensive for many and 300\u2013500 million courses of CQ are still used each year [3,4,12,13].",

            "text": "CQ and other 4-aminoquinolines (Figure 1) accumulate in the parasite\u2019s digestive vacuole, bind to hematin (ferriprotoporphyrin IX [FeIII-FP]) and inhibit its sequestration into hemozoin (Figure 2)\n[14\u201317]. Resistant parasites accumulate less CQ and exhibit less hematin binding, enabling them to survive in the presence of much higher concentrations of the drug [18\u201321]. Recent studies on CQ-resistant parasites have implicated specific polymorphisms in a protein referred to as PfCRT, the P. falciparum CQ-resistance transporter (Figure 2)\n[22,23]. PfCRT is a digestive vacuole membrane protein that may normally function as an amino acid transporter [22,24,25]. PfCRT alleles expressed by CQ-resistant parasites have fewer basic residues on the surface facing the digestive vacuole lumen (Figure 2). This may allow the leak of positively charged forms of CQ down an electrochemical gradient [26], and thereby increase the likelihood of parasite survival at plasma concentrations of CQ that would normally be therapeutic. Alternatively, PfCRT may function as an efflux pump [27]. Additive or compensatory mutations in other proteins may be needed for very high levels of CQ resistance [28]. PfCRT mutations appear to confer a fitness cost, as CQ resistance has been found to decline in areas where CQ pressure has been removed [3,29\u201332]. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily mean that acceptable efficacy is reinstated, especially in nonimmune patients [33].",

From these foci, CQ-resistant parasites have gradually spread to all areas, reaching Africa in the late 1970s [35]. The inevitable demise of CQ as a useful therapeutic agent has triggered the development of a number of other quinoline antimalarials and aminoalcohols. These include the 4-aminoquinoline, amodiaquine, the bisquinoline, piperaquine, the quinoline methanol, mefloquine, the 9-phenanthrenemethanol, halofantrine, and the fluorenemethanol, lumefantrine (Figure 1,\nTable 1). Each of these compounds is more active than CQ against CQ-resistant parasites. This may be because they are more lipophilic and/or bulkier than CQ and therefore less effectively extruded by the mutant PfCRT [36]. Indeed, the aminoalcohols are more active against CQ-resistant parasites than against CQ-sensitive parasites, suggesting that they might bind preferentially to mutant PfCRT and block a critical transport function [37]. Resistance to these newer drugs is also increasing, especially for those, such as mefloquine, that have been used extensively [38,39]. Toxicity concerns have also limited the widespread use of halofantrine (a drug that is no longer recommended by the WHO because of cardiac effects), amodiaquine (as chemoprophylaxis rather than acute treatment), and, to a lesser extent, mefloquine [40]. Nonetheless, a number of these drugs are now being considered for use in combination with an artemisinin derivative [41].",

For example, relatively little resistance has developed to quinine, despite its use for over 300 years as a monotherapy [50]. This is likely to reflect the relatively short half-life of quinine (<1 day, compared with at least several weeks for the other quinolines) and consequently a limited opportunity for exposure of parasites to subtherapeutic plasma concentrations. Consistent with this hypothesis, clinically significant resistance to mefloquine (which has a half-life of approximately 2 weeks) developed within 6 years of its introduction in Thailand in 1984 [51,52]. The efficacy of quinine (which shares cross-resistance with mefloquine) has also started to decline in the same area [53]. Polymorphisms in the P. falciparum P-glycoprotein homolog-1 (Pgh1) have been shown to be associated with altered sensitivity to mefloquine, quinine and lumefantrine, as well as artesunate [38,54\u201356]. Resistance to mefloquine [38] and artemether\u2013lumefantrine [57] has also been correlated with an increased copy number of the pfmdr1 gene. Associations between polymorphisms in other ATP-binding cassette transporters (referred to as G7 and G49) and increased resistance to quinine, artesunate and dihydroartemisinin have also been noted [58].",

Recently, the authors\u2019 group has shown that the 8-aminoquinolines, primaquine (PQ) and tafenoquine, are effective synergizers of the activity of CQ against resistant parasites [64]. PQ is already licensed for use in combination with CQ for treating the liver forms of P. vivax malaria. Compared with other suggested combinations, the low cost of a CQ\u2013PQ combination is a major advantage; treatment with PQ costs approximately US$0.15. However, due to the serious toxicity (hemolysis) that can occur in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the patient\u2019s G6PD status would need to be assessed before treatment with a CQ\u2013PQ combination. Thus, PQ cannot be used in unregulated settings and this may limit its widespread application. A simple and inexpensive test is available [67], or alternatively, other similar compounds that are less toxic might be suitable as inexpensive synergizers of CQ action [64].",

However, clinical use of this 4-aminoquinoline has been severely restricted due to reports of hepatotoxicity and agranulocytosis when the drug is used for prophylaxis [68]. The amodiaquine side-chain contains a 4-aminophenol group capable of forming potentially toxic quinoneimine metabolites [69,70]. Structure\u2013activity studies suggest that the presence of a 4-arylamino moiety provides analogs with superior activity against CQ-resistant strains and that the presence of an aromatic hydroxyl function is important for additional levels of antiparasitic activity. Thus, the interchange of the 3\u00b4-Mannich side chain with the 4\u00b4-hydroxyl function should provide a new template for active new drugs that are chemically incapable of forming potentially toxic quinoneimine metabolites. Isoquine, the direct isomer of amodiaquine, has emerged as the lead candidate. This compound has potent activity against CQ-resistant parasites in vitro and oral activity in rodent models of malaria, and should be as cheap to prepare as amodiaquine on an industrial scale [71]. Isoquine is currently in preclinical evaluation in a partnership between the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Pharmaceuticals [71].",

The precise mode of action of artemisinin-related compounds is still a matter of debate and the active endoperoxides are known to accumulate in a variety of parasite compartments, including the cytosol, digestive vacuole and membranes. They interact with ferrous iron (FeII) or with the reduced form of heme (ferroprotoporphyrin IX [FeII-FP]). FeII-FP is thought to activate the endoperoxide moiety to form reactive oxygen species and a carbon-centered radical intermediate that reacts with susceptible groups within parasite enzymes [77\u201382]. Artemisinins also form covalent adducts with hemozoin in the digestive vacuole [77,83,84]. FeIII-FP is formed in the digestive vacuole during hemoglobin digestion. Due to the oxidizing environment there can only be a tiny proportion of FeII-FP in the digestive vacuole [85]. This may be enough to activate endoperoxides by a catalytic mechanism and thereby inhibit targets in this compartment [86,87]. Alternatively, a small proportion of FeIII-FP may leak out of the digestive vacuole into the reducing environment of the parasite cytosol and be converted into FeII-FP [88,89].

Treatment of parasites with artemisinin results in morphological changes to various organelles, including the mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope [93], although these changes can also occur after exposure to other classes of antimalarial drugs. Proteomic studies indicate that exposure of P. falciparum to artemether leads to upregulation of a range of glycolytic enzymes and stress response proteins [94]. Given the remarkable potency of endoperoxide antimalarials, it is likely that the lethal effects of the drugs are due to free radical-induced damage of particular proteins rather than more general damage caused by rapidly diffusing reactive oxygen species. Indeed, recent studies have provided convincing evidence that the P. falciparum homolog of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (also known as PfATPase6) is a major downstream target of activated artemisinin in the parasite cytosol [95,96]. Other targets, such as digestive vacuole enzymes and the translationally controlled tumor protein homolog, have also been implicated [86,87]. Components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain have been shown to be susceptible to artemisinin in yeast [97]; however, it is not clear if these are important targets in plasmodia.",

However, decreased susceptibility to artemisinin is readily observed in laboratory strains [77,98\u2013100]. It can be associated with the same polymorphism in Pgh1 that confers resistance to mefloquine [38,56]. Mutations in a key residue (L263E) in PfATPase6 result in decreased susceptibility to artemisinin in an oocyte expression model [96]. There is no association between this particular polymorphism of PfATPase 6 and artemisinin sensitivity in field isolates [38]; however, a reduced response to the related compound, artemether, shows association with another polymorphism (S769N) of PfATPase6 in some field isolates [101]. Polymorphisms in PfCRT also affect sensitivity to mefloquine, halofantrine and artemisinin [102,103]. Plasmodium berghei can develop stable resistance to artemisinin without mutations in PfATPase6, PfCRT or Pgh1 [99], indicating that other genes may also be involved. It is critical that a better understanding of artemisinin action and resistance is obtained so that strategies can be developed to retard the development of resistance in the field.",

However, artemisinin and its derivatives are not suitable for prophylaxis or for use as monotherapy due to their very short half-lives in vivo (from minutes to hours). Even with a 5-day treatment regimen, recrudescences are frequently observed if these compounds are used alone [106]. To ensure cure and to encourage compliance, patients are usually treated with a 3-day dose regimen comprising an artemisinin-related compound in combination with a second drug with a longer half-life [104]. Since 2001, the WHO has recommended that uncomplicated malaria should be treated with a combination of an artemisinin derivative and a drug with a different mode of action in areas where P. falciparum is predominant. Experience with mefloquine and artesunate in South-East Asia has led some to argue that combinations with complementary pharmacokinetics (i.e., a short half-life artemisinin and a long half-life partner drug) are most effective. This is despite concerns that mismatched pharmacokinetics allow parasites to evolve resistance sequentially as the longer half-life partner persists in a vulnerable time-window, a result that could undermine the benefits of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) [107].",

In Africa, only approximately 50% of children with fever in malarious areas receive any treatment and 84% of these are treated with CQ, which is largely ineffective [113]. In an effort to enable the implementation of ACTs in Africa, there have been calls for international donors to cover the increased cost.

An important consideration in the design of any new peroxide analog is the concern of neurotoxicity. Any analog with a higher logP than artemether is likely to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier [74]. Haynes and coworkers have prepared new analogs with potentially reduced neurotoxicity by applying the ADME paradigm (used for optimizing absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion). This has resulted in analogs with enhanced water solubility, which increases gastrointestinal absorption but reduces passage across the blood\u2013brain barrier [133]. Artemisone (a Bayer product) is one such analog that illustrates the success of the ADME approach to drug design.",

Organic chemists have long known that exposing simple alkenes to ozone creates an endoperoxide bridge in the resulting ozonide that is identical to the critical endoperoxide bridge of artemisinin. However, the resulting ozonides are chemically unstable, making them useless as potential antimalarials. In a key breakthrough, Vennerstrom and colleagues showed that stability could be dramatically improved by substituting a bulky adamantane cage onto the ozonide [134]. Some of these compounds exhibited better activity even than artemisinin itself, but still suffered from poor water solubility. This problem was subsequently solved and MMV is currently supporting the development and testing of one of the second generation compounds, known as OZ277 (Figure 1). This compound has a longer half-life than artemisinin, appears to be well absorbed, has an acceptable toxicity profile and is suitable for industrial level scale-up of synthesis [134,135]. It has been shown to be highly active against field isolates from Gabon [136]. A product is expected to reach the market by 2009, with a target price of US$1 per treatment.",

Delaying the implementation of effective ACTs in regions of high drug resistance will encourage the unregulated use of the artemisinins and partner drugs as monotherapies, which could further exacerbate the problem of drug resistance. However, the choice of which combination to use remains controversial. An ideal drug combination would contain two or more drugs with different modes of action. Each drug would be safe, well tolerated, effective and readily available in fixed dose combination, preferably as a single dose or at most as a 3-day regimen. At least one of the drugs should be fast-acting and exhibit a broad spectrum of action. Most importantly, the drugs must be affordable. Recent reviews provide an overview of the currently available drug combinations, making it clear that the ideal combination does not currently exist [72,98]. Important challenges for the immediate future include the registration of additional artemisinin combinations with suitable inexpensive partner drugs. In the longer term it is imperative that cheap synthetic endoperoxides with longer half-lives are developed and matched with partners with similar pharmacokinetic profiles. It may be necessary to employ triple combinations to ensure that at least two drugs are present in the patient\u2019s system long enough to ensure cure [144]. Alternatively, different effective treatment regimens can be rotated within a country or region to safeguard against resistance, with changes directed by regular in vivo and in vitro monitoring of efficacy. Clearly, any new antimalarial therapies need to be integrated into other strategies aimed at controlling disease, such as mosquito control, impregnated bed nets, improved management of severe malaria and intermittent preventative treatment regimens for pregnant women. It now appears likely that the aim of the Roll Back Malaria campaign, to half malaria deaths by 2010 [4,114,145], will not be achieved. If a malaria disaster is to be averted there are many challenges to be faced in the coming decade.",

Nonetheless, a recent upswing in political will and in public and private funding of efforts to tackle the problem of malaria ensures that any effective (and inexpensive) new antimalarials will progress rapidly through the drug development pipeline and will be translated into the field. The bitter experience of watching the inexorable development of resistance to each of the antimalarials that was developed in the 20th century tells us that it is critical that we make appropriate use of the handful of effective drugs currently in our armory or now under development. A global approach to the coordinated and rapid deployment of ACTs is essential for malarious regions with entrenched resistance to other antimalarial drugs. It is critical that decisions regarding which drug regimen to change to, and how to implement the changes, are made in a way that maximizes the benefit to the patient while minimizing the risk of the development of drug resistance. Finally, it is essential that any policy decisions to implement more expensive antimalarials are funded by substantially increased inputs from donor nations.",
