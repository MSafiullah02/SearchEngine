            "text": "One LOE 1 (quality fair) prospective, randomized, single blind controlled manikin-based trial (Kromann, 2009, 21) favoured the use of testing during a resuscitation course. The study was conducted using seventh semester medical students undertaking a standardized resuscitation course in groups of 6 subjects. The intervention group received 3.5 hours of instruction followed by 30 minutes of skills testing, where each learner was individually tested for 5 minutes, allowing the other members of group to observe the scenarios. The control group received an identical 3.5 hours of instruction followed by a 30 minute time period used to run through 3 or 4 scenarios (identical to those used for testing in the intervention group). The learning outcome was assessed 2 weeks after the course by a single assessor, blinded to the training and 'testing' status of the subject, using a 25-item checklist with each item scored on a scale on of 0-5. Learning outcomes were significantly higher in the intervention group (n = 41; mean score 82.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 79.4-86.2) compared with the control group (n = 40; mean score 73.3%, 95% CI 70.5-76.1) (P < 0.001). These results support the notion that assessment at the conclusion of a standardized resuscitation course can improve learning outcomes compared to increased practice time without testing. Limitations of the study include the relatively short time interval between the course and the assessment of learning outcomes (i.e. demonstrates testing improved short-term retention but no comment can be made on longer term retention) and the significant loss to follow-up of enrolled participants.",
