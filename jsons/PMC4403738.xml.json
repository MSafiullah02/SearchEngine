Total nucleic acids were extracted using a guanidinium lysis/isopropanol precipitation protocol [17] and amplified using the method of Lu et al. which targets the HRV 5\u2032 noncoding region (NCR) [18].

Trimmed sequences of 127 base-pairs were aligned using Geneious R6.1 (Biomatters) and Seaview 4.4 [21], [22]. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the maximum likelihood method with 100 bootstrap replicates using PhyML 3.0 within DIVEIN [23]. Neighbor joining trees were drawn and edited using FigTree v1.4.1 [24]. Sequences were considered to be divergent genotypes if they differed from other study sequences by >2% when compared using BLAST [25]. Study sequences were not submitted to GenBank because they were shorter than the >200 bp requirement and are available upon request.",

We found that HRV-C was associated with LRTI compared to HRV-A. Specific HRV-A and HRV-C genotypes were also associated with LRTI. Patients with sequential HRV illness episodes had new infections with distinct genotypes rather than long-term shedding. Additional studies should further clarify the role of specific HRV genotypes in causing LRTI in the outpatient, acute-care setting.",
