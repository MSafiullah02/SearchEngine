            "text": "Dengue virus, a flavivirus, is an RNA virus that causes dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever. It is a major cause of febrile illness in the tropics, particularly in cities where favourable habitats for Aedes aegypti breeding are abundant (Gubler, 1997, Gubler, 2004). Detection of thrombocytopenia with a clinical picture of fever, rash and bone pain, including orbital pain, provides a presumptive diagnosis of dengue fever (George and Lum, 1997), whilst dengue haemorrhagic fever has other important signs, particularly haemoconcentration due to plasma leakage (WHO, 1997). However, laboratory confirmation is necessary, as clinical case definitions show low positive predictive values, ranging from 22% to 62% for several different combinations of symptoms (Dietz et al., 1990). Many laboratories rely on serology as the primary diagnostic method, but antibodies may take several days to appear so initial serology is often negative (Guzman and Kouri, 2004). Several RT-PCR protocols for dengue have been described (Chow et al., 1993, Deubel et al., 1990, Henchal et al., 1991, Lanciotti et al., 1992, Morita et al., 1991) but these are not widely used in the clinical laboratory (Guzman and Kouri, 2004).",

As SARS and dengue fever had similar initial presenting symptoms (Peiris et al., 2003), RT-PCR was introduced to detect dengue viral RNA as a routine test, with the results reported on the same day. The test proved invaluable because a rapid and early positive diagnosis of dengue made a diagnosis of SARS much less likely, although co-infection with the SARS coronavirus was theoretically possible. This relieved the whole health infrastructure of the need to isolate these patients and to trace their contacts, a strategy used by Singapore to control the SARS outbreak (Gopalakrishna et al., 2004). As isolation rooms were at a premium, a confirmed diagnosis of dengue fever was helpful. Final decisions to remove patients from isolation required interpretation of all clinical and laboratory evidence.",

The Superscript One\u2013Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to perform reverse transcription and PCR in one tube according to the manufacturer's instructions with 1 \u03bcl of each primer. The sequence of the forward primer (CDC10418) was 5\u2032-TTGAGTAAACYRTGCTGCCTGTAGCTC-3\u2032 and the reverse primer (CDC10590) was 5\u2032-GGGTCTCCTCTAACCTCTAGTCCT-3\u2032. These primer sequences targeted the 3\u2032 end of the dengue viral genome. They were developed by G.J. Chang (Division of Vector-borne Diseases, NCID, Fort Collins, CO, USA) and L.J. Chien (Center for Disease Control, Taiwan) and shared with the participants of the Asia Pacific Economic Congress (APEC) Workshop on molecular epidemiology of dengue virus held in Taipei in December 2002, the objective of which was to achieve a standardised method for molecular surveillance of dengue viruses in the Asia Pacific. RT-PCR conditions were: 1 cycle of 60 \u00b0C for 30 min and 95 \u00b0C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 65 \u00b0C for 45 s and 72 \u00b0C for 10 min and finally 1 cycle of 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. Then, 10 \u03bcl of RT-PCR product with 2 \u03bcl of loading dye were run in a 2% agarose gel with 30 \u03bcg/ml ethidium bromide. Bands were visualised with UV light, captured by Polaroid and interpreted visually. Three controls were included on each run: a negative control using water, a positive patient control and a control from heat-inactivated cultured dengue virus serotype-2 that was isolated in Singapore. Test samples were run in duplicate. Inhibition was not assessed.",

The culture was incubated at 32 \u00b0C and observed daily for cytopathic effects (CPE). After 7 days of culture, the culture supernatant was harvested if CPEs were observed in 75% or more of the monolayer. If no CPEs were observed, the supernatant was passaged onto a fresh monolayer of C6/36 cells. This was repeated twice. Upon harvesting the supernatant, the cell monolayer was scraped off with a rubber policeman, washed with PBS solution and spotted onto a Teflon-coated slide. Flavivirus, dengue complex and dengue serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies, derived from the hybridoma (ATCC HB-112, HB-114, HB-46, HB-47, HB-48, HB-49) culture supernatant, were then used to confirm the isolation of dengue virus via indirect immunofluorescence.",

A high proportion of laboratories probably do not offer any nucleic acid tests (Guzman and Kouri, 2004). The clinical and public health need for a fast, sensitive test to help distinguish cases of dengue from SARS provided the impetus for us to introduce RT-PCR to our diagnostic laboratory. Equipment, reagents, primers and protocols were borrowed or obtained to set up this RT-PCR for dengue in concert with RT-PCR for SARS coronavirus. A small group of staff was chosen and taught some basic molecular biology and the principles of the test. Careful pipetting, avoiding contamination and proper storage of materials were emphasised throughout this period. Chemical (e.g. ethidium bromide) and biological hazards were discussed at length and samples were processed at biosafety level 2 with level 3 practices. A low threshold for consultation was encouraged so that staff was well supported.",

Although this may not be completely accurate, as suggested in one patient who was positive for R. typhi, our results show that 17 of 22 clinically defined patients who had negative RT-PCR in the first 6 days of illness did have laboratory-confirmed dengue. The accuracy of the epidemiological data used to calculate the day of illness on which the sample was collected cannot be verified. However, the data were collected and recorded during the SARS epidemic when all staff and the general public were \u2018on alert\u2019 and the timing of onset of fevers was paramount.

The high specificity of 100% reflects the robust nature of the assay and the technical care taken to avoid contamination despite the lack of experience. The performance data assume the clinical discharge diagnosis to be the gold standard. However, this diagnosis itself may have been influenced by the dengue RT-PCR result, so these encouraging specificity results should be interpreted with a little caution. The fall off in the sensitivity from 100% in early disease to 74% by day 6 is disappointing but expected because the viraemia disappears around days 5 to 7 (Innis et al., 1989, Summers et al., 1984, Vaughn et al., 1997). We did, however, find positives in a few samples on the eighth day of illness. More sensitive RNA extraction protocols or a nested RT-PCR would increase the sensitivity of the test and may thus extend this diagnostic window.",

This is probably due to the degradation of limited viable viral particles in the serum samples. This explanation is supported by the finding of a statistically significant difference in mean duration from onset of illness between the virus isolation positive and negative samples. Those RT-PCR positive but virus isolation negative samples were taken, on average, a day later than those that were positive by both methods. This could have resulted in a lower viraemia level in the sera that were negative by virus isolation. Whilst it was intended that samples were separated quickly and refrigerated or frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C while processing was awaited, the realities of a routine diagnostic laboratory dictate that samples may be left lying around pending attention. This was particularly so during the SARS outbreak as microbiological investigation was routine for all patients admitted to our hospital. In addition, the large workload delayed the transfer of samples for virus isolation, some by almost up to a year. Together, these factors could have contributed to the low virus isolation rate.",

It is possible but expensive, so we applied the same standards to this RT-PCR system as we do to other test methods and did not do it.

The product insert claims sensitivities at admission and discharge, respectively, of 88% and 94% for secondary dengue and 76% and 100% for primary dengue, although the day of illness is not given. These data are from studies in Thailand where patients may present later in disease. Two samples yielded false positive results according to the discharge diagnosis: one of them, drawn on day 2 of illness, was still IgM positive when the same sample was re-tested, although it was negative by PCR. The patient had a thrombocytopenia of 97 \u00d7 109/l. Two other patients with positive serology samples were reported negative on second samples, although both patients were RT-PCR positive. Re-testing the second serology sample showed one to be positive and the other negative. There is no definite reason but explanations include pre-analytical errors, technical errors with labelling and aliquoting, and the fact that the test is subject to intraobserver and interobserver variation.
