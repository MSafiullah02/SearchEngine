Citation network is one such example of a complex network, which captures citation relationships between paper sources or documents. A citation network is a directed and acyclic information network, with the documents being the nodes, and directed edges representing citations of one document by another, thereby capturing the flow of information or knowledge in a particular field. An important property of citation networks is the \u201cin-degree distribution\u201d of nodes. Several models have been proposed to illustrate this distribution [15] \u2013 but while these models aim at retaining the power-law degree distribution in synthetic networks, they fail to reproduce other important properties that real-world citation networks might possess. For instance, Ren et al. [16] pointed out that existing models underestimate the number of triangles and thus fail to model the high clustering in citation networks, which is closely related to network transitivity and the formation of communities. In a series of papers [5, 6], Chakraborty et al. showed that the temporal growth of the in-degree of nodes (aka, citation trajectory) in citation networks can be grouped into five major patterns, and such patterns are prevalent across citation networks of different domains, e.g., Computer Science, Physics.",

This immediately calls for the need to investigate more involved growth models. We address this issue by accounting for local and global influences exerted by individual nodes in a network. We introduce the concept of a \u2018location space\u2019 associated with the nodes in the network [3], and propose two new preferential-attachment growth models based on this concept - Location-Based Model (LBM) and Location-Based Model with Gaussian active subspaces (LBM-G). LBM models both the local and global influences, with new nodes connecting preferentially based on the combined influence. LBM-G is an extension of LBM, which models regions of high activity that can be shifted periodically. We evaluate the proposed models on both the Computer Science and Physics citation networks. Experimental results show that LBM and LBM-G are indeed more accurate at realizing the citation trajectories of nodes compared to other network models.1\n",

They observed that contrary to the general consensus that the shape of the citation trajectory of papers are the same [2, 9], there are five different shapes of citation trajectories prevalent across different domains of citation network (see Fig. 1 for the toy examples of trajectories): (i) Early Risers (ER) with a single peak in citation count within the first five years (known as activation period) after publication; (ii) Frequent Risers (FR) with distinct multiple peaks; (iii) Late Risers (LR) with a single peak after five years of publication (but not in the last year); (iv) Steady Risers (SR) with monotonically increasing citation count; and (v) Others (OT) whose average numbers of citations per year are less than 1.\n",

This can be explained by the effect S has on the activation period of a node. A higher S means the node\u2019s location stays activated for a longer period of time, thus giving it more opportunities to achieve a peak.The proportion of Steady Risers has a negative correlation with S, in general. A node belonging to this category should not achieve a peak during the activation period. This means that the factor controlling the proportion of Early Risers can be used to control the proportion of Steady Risers as well. A lower S means the active subspace gets shifted frequently, thus not giving ample opportunity to form a very high peak. A higher S would instead keep the location activated for an extended period of time which may lead to higher peaks early on when the number of nodes in the network is low, and then lower peaks as the number of nodes increases.The proportion of Frequent Risers should depend upon the frequency with which a certain subspace is re-activated.
