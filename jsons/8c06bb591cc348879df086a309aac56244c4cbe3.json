The authors suggest, on an in vitro experiment results basis, an alternative HCQ dose regimen for future clinical trials while several clinical trials on chloroquine (CQ)-and HCQ-based regimens for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still ongoing [1] .",

Unfortunately, CQ did not show efficacy in inhibiting viral replication in a mouse SARS-CoV model [3] . Nevertheless, by considering its anti-inflammatory properties, it has been postulated that CQ/ HCQ may have some effect on SARS [3, 4] -in particular, by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], interleukin [IL] 6) and consequently blocking the subsequent cascade of events which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4] .",

Moreover, CQ showed a paradoxical effect when administered in treating Chikungunya virus infection: in a prophylactic study in a nonhuman primate model the infection was enhanced by CQ treatment; in a curative study in a human cohort, CQ did not affect the acute phase of the disease, in term of symptoms and viral clearance, but the chronic complications of Chikungunya were more frequent in the treated group compared with the control group. This paradoxical effect has been explained by a delay in immune adaptive response to the virus provoked by CQ administration that could nullify the antiviral activity shown in vitro [8] .",
