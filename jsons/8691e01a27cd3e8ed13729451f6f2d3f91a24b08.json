The model consists of a general population in which the R 0 value is slightly below 1, but in which a super-spreading small subgroup with high R 0 , coupled to the general population, is contaminating a significant fraction of the population. The epidemic starts to slow down when herd immunity is reached in this subgroup. The dynamics of this system is quite robust against non-pharmaceutical measures.",

We also diminish the coupling of our super spreaders to the general population to a much lower value by putting \u03b2 C to 0.5. We call this Model 4.",

As we can see, the behaviour is still very similar to the behaviour of the base model. However, this time, the logarithmic derivative remains a very long time slightly above 0. It is remarkable that even with a very slight coupling between the super spreaders and the general population, the initial logarithmic derivative of the general population is still dominated by the influence of the super spreaders.",

Indeed, the dynamics of this epidemic seems paradoxical at first sight, when interpreted in the frame of a simple SIR model: the very high apparent R 0 derived from the extremely fast doubling times of the epidemic would hint at a huge peak, and a necessary herd immunity which would be above 60% of the population. Given the CFR of the order of 1%, that has lead to predictions of large numbers of death. But the epidemic seems to have a quickly diminishing logarithmic derivative of most of its proxies, be it hospital admissions or deceased patients, while at the same time absolutely not reaching anything near herd immunity. Of course, one may think that this is due to the policies put into place. But the differences in policies put in place, and the universality of this observed dynamics may raise questions as to the influence of these policies versus the dynamics of this epidemic.",

If measures diminish the coupling \u03b2 C between the overall population and the super spreader cohort, then the effect will be significant, though.
