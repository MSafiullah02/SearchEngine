These changes have strongly infl uenced both the nature of cabin service and the working conditions of cabin crew members. On the one hand, their jobs have become more demanding. On the other, they have, through service design, maintained a certain distance from their work and continue to enjoy the freedom it offers. They face increasingly stiff demands but remain grateful to the airline for providing the opportunities they enjoy.",

Cheaper travel led expansion of networks as new routes were opened. With the advent of the Boeing 747, nicknamed the \"jumbo jet,\" the era of air travel as mass transportation truly began.
