According to the World Health Organization (WHO) surveillance draft in January 2020, any traveler to Wuhan, Hubei Province in China, two weeks before the onset of the symptoms, is suspected to be a COVID-19 patient [1,3]. Additionally, WHO distributed interim guidance for laboratories that carry out the testing for the newly emerged outbreak and infection prevention and control guidance [4,5]. COVID-19 viral pneumonia is related to the seafood market when an unknown animal is responsible for the emergence of the outbreak [2]. Other countries started their surveillance borders to prevent the spread of the new unknown coronavirus [6]. Until one month ago, 41 cases were confirmed to be COVID-19 positives leaving one dead and seven in critical care in China. This number is grossly increasing daily, and the number of confirmed cases at the date of writing this manuscript exceeded 80,000, with >2700 deaths [[7], [8], [9][63]]. On 20 January 2020, the National Health Commission of China confirmed the human-to-human transmission of the Wuhan outbreak (COVID-19) [9]. The symptoms include fever, malaise, dry cough, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress [2].",

Two groups of protein characterize HCoVs; structural, such as Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N) Matrix (M) and Envelope (E), and non-structural proteins such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (nsp12) [11]. RdRp is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. RdRp is targeted in different RNA viruses, including Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Zika Virus (ZIKV), and coronaviruses (CoVs) [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. The active site of RdRp is highly conserved representing two successive aspartate residues protruding from a beta-turn structure making them surface accessible through the nucleotide channel (free nucleotides can pass through) [25,26].",

Different directly acting antiviral drugs are approved against other viruses, by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), such as Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin against RdRp of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). These drugs are nucleotides derivative competing with physiological nucleotide for RdRp active site [22,27,28]. Additionally, a huge number of attempts to develop anti-RdRp compounds are under clinical testing against different viruses. The half-maximal Effective Concentration (EC50) for Ribavirin against COVID-19 is 109.5 \u03bcM, while its half-maximum Inhibition Concentration (IC50) against Dengue virus is 8 \u03bcM [29,30]. Sofosbuvir show 4 \u03bcM against the Zika virus [31]. Remdesivir shows EC90 of 1.76 \u03bcM against COVID-19 in vitro [30]. We focus here in the present study on nucleotide inhibitors due to its strong evidence of inhibiting emerging viral RdRps [11,16]. We build the COVID-19 RdRp model using homology modeling after sequence comparison to the available structures in the protein data bank [32]. Molecular docking is then performed to test some direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs against COVID-19 RdRp (Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Remidisvir, IDX-184). Additionally, the native nucleotides GTP and UTP, from which IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir are derived, are also tested against COVID-19 RdRp model. The results are promising and suggest possible inhibition for the currently available therapeutics against the newly emerged coronavirus.",

SARS HCoV solved structure (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) is used as a template that shares identical 97.08% of the sequence with COVID-19 RdRp. 6NUR, chain A, is a SARS HCoV non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) solved experimentally using cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) with 3.1 \u00c5 resolution deposited in the protein data bank last year [35]. The Molprobity web server of the Duke University, and the structure analysis and verification server (SAVES) of the University of California Los Angles (UCLA) are used to test the model [36,37]. The program used to judge the validity of the model are PROCHECK [38], Verify 3D [39], PROVE [40], and ERRAT [41] in addition to the Ramachandran plot of the Molprobity. After validation, the computational chemistry workspace SCIGRESS is used to minimize the model and to perform molecular docking experiments [20,22,42,43]. The minimization of the model is performed using the MM3 force field after the addition of missed Hydrogen atoms [44].",

Eight different compounds are tested against Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp, including Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), Uracil triphosphate (UTP), Cinnamaldehyde, and Thymoquinone. Sofosbuvir is an approved drug by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) against Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-structural protein 5 (NS5B) RdRp in the year 2013 [19,[46], [47], [48]]. It gives excellent results against other viruses including the Zika virus [16,17,49,50]. IDX-184 was under clinical trials against HCV and gave better results compared to other drugs against HCV, MERS and SARS HCoVs, and Zika virus RdRps (2017, [11,19,23,[51], [52], [53]]). Ribavirin is a broad-acting antiviral drug used to treat different viruses in combination with immunomodulators or direct-acting antivirals [[54], [55], [56]]. Remdisivir is a nucleotide analog used to treat Ebola virus, Marburg virus, MERS and SARS infections [57]. Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone are negative control compounds that proved its inactivity against RdRp in HCV and Zika virus [26].",

The active site is surface accessible as we can see from the surface representation allowing the interaction with the free nucleotides passing through the nucleotide channel of the RdRp. Although some insertions found in COVID-19 RdRp, these insertions are apart from the active site aspartates and have little effect on the model quality (see the Ramachandran plot). Additionally, the homology built model is minimized using the MM3 force field to ensure its reliability before performing the docking study.",

Optimization is performed using MM3 then PM6 force field after that further optimization is accomplished through B3LYP functional of Density Functional Theory (DFT) quantum mechanics [44,[59], [60], [61]]. The active site aspartates D255 and D256 are treated as flexible during the docking experiment. A grid box size of 30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 30 \u00c5 centered at (x, y, z) of (142.1, 138.7, 150.0) \u00c5 is used in the docking by utilizing the AutoDock tools [62]. AutoDock Vina utilizes its scoring function (Vina) to predict the interaction between the abovementioned ligands and the RdRps' active site. Fig. 2\nshows the docking score values for COVID-19 (blue columns) and SARS HCoVs (orange columns). The SARS solved structure (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) is used to dock the same ligands in order to compare its binding energy to that of COVID-19 RdRp. The grid box (30 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 30 \u00c5) for SARS RdRp is centered at (141.2, 138.5, 149.4) \u00c5. As reflected from the docking scores, the eight compounds, including the physiological GTP and UTP and the four drugs IDX-184, Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir can bind to both COVID-19 and SARS HCoV RdRps with good binding energy (\u22126.5 up to \u22129.0 kcal/mol). Despite SARS HCoV RdRp show slightly higher binding energies (lower in binding) compared to COVID-19 RdRp, the difference is still non-significant for Ribavirin, Remdisivir, Sofosbuvir and its parent nucleotide, UTP. On average, 0.95 kcal/mol is the difference between the SARS and COVID-19 RdRps' binding energies for these compounds. On the other hand, the difference between COVID-19 and SARS HCoV RdRps' binding energies to IDX-184 and its parent nucleotide GTP are 2.3 and 1.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, all the tested compounds show lower (better) binding energies to COVID-19 RdRp compared to SARS RdRp. The negative control compounds Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone both show lower binding affinities to either SARS or COVID-19 (higher than \u22125.6 kcal/mol).",
