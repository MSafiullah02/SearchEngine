Therefore, their contribution to the transmission dynamics of an infection should be incorporated into the associated models.",

            "text": "During a disease outbreak, any intervention strategy aimed at mitigating the disease impact is highly dependent on the ability to identify infected individuals, a task which is greatly impeded in the absence of clinical symptoms [1]. In particular, this becomes a vital task for a newly emergent pathogen (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenza), due to the absence of a vaccine in the early stages of the outbreak. Policy decisions for public health planning rely on early estimates of disease parameters, however, unreported subclinical cases lead to difficulties in accurately estimating the basic reproduction number of the disease [2]. The resultant uncertainty in epidemiological models greatly hinders the decision making process and casts doubt on the effectiveness of proposed interventions. The presence of subclinical infections in a population can significantly influence the outcome of non-pharmaceutical interventions, for example monitoring international borders for symptomatic travellers can be undermined as asymptomatic individuals are impossible to identify using standard methods [3]. Furthermore, isolating and/or treating clinical cases may be inadequate to protect vulnerable populations from the further spread of disease. Prophylaxis of exposed populations can be a useful intervention, in particular, when a vaccine needs time to be developed. However, the possibility of drug resistance as a byproduct of the treatment process is an undesirable, but potential, side effect and its epidemiological impact and the likelihood of transmission of drug-resistant infectious agents need to be studied closer.",

The first separates the infectious population into asymptomatic and symptomatic states immediately following the onset of infectiousness [4], [5], [6]. However, not all diseases follow such a straightforward path and, in particular, the relative durations of the latent and incubation periods should be considered. For certain diseases, a more appropriate model may allow for a preclinical state where an asymptomatic infectious state precedes the onset of clinical symptoms, Fig. 1\n. Such a model has been used in the context of influenza where the incubation period is believed to exceed the duration of the latent state [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].",

In the model there are two classes of infected, and thus infectious, individuals; those who develop symptoms after an asymptomatic period and those who remain asymptomatic but infectious and recover without having passed through the symptomatic state. We provide a comparison with an alternative widely-used model which neglects the existence of a preclinical infectious state. We investigate the same features in a modified version of the model, where treatment is applied as an intervention strategy and the resultant development of drug resistance as a side effect is evaluated. Both models are based on a previously developed model for the emergence of drug resistance during influenza epidemics under explicit consideration of asymptomatic cases [7]. We now generalise that model for any persistent infectious disease with infectious asymptomatic cases and in addition we elaborate on the dynamics when treatment is used as intervention strategy.",

In any case, this condition must be satisfied for Pe to exist. The second inequality can be written asR0>1-MT2(\u03a90+\u03a92)+c\u03b4M(\u03a90+\u03a91+\u03a92)\u03a90\u03a91\u03a92(\u03a92+c\u03b4),which is always satisfied when R0>1. Finally, the third inequality can be written in the formf1f2-f0f3=\u03a90\u03a91\u03a92R0(R0-1)(\u03b1+\u03a91+\u03a92)\u03a92M\u03b2S\u03b4+\u03a90\u03a91\u03a922R0(R0-1)+MR0\u03a922+\u03a90(\u03b1+\u03a92)+\u03bc\u03a91+\u03b1(\u03b3A+\u03bc)+f2M\u03a90\u03a92\u03b2S\u03b4+R0\u03a922>0.Hence, the endemic equilibrium Pe is always locally asymptotically stable. The existence and stability of the equilibria is completely determined by the threshold parameter R0. The disease-free equilibrium exists for all R0, is stable when R0<1 and unstable when R0>1. The endemic equilibrium exists only for R0>1 and is always stable. This is an example of a transcritical bifurcation. As R0 crosses unity from below the disease-free equilibrium loses its stability and a positive asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium appears. The forward bifurcation is shown in Fig. 3\n, where we plot the steady state value of S as a function of R0.",

In addition, this model assumes that all asymptomatically infected individuals recover without ever developing symptoms. We believe this is an oversimplification of the disease pathway for many infections (e.g. influenza). In this section we investigate the impact of neglecting the preclinical state on disease dynamics. For clarity, we will refer to this model as Model II. The alternative system of equations is given by(8)dSdt=\u03bc(1-S)+\u03b1(1-S-IA-IS)-(\u03b2AIA+\u03b2SIS)S,\n(9)dIAdt=(1-p)(\u03b2AIA+\u03b2SIS)S-(\u03b3A+\u03bc)IA,\n(10)dISdt=p(\u03b2AIA+\u03b2SIS)S-(\u03b3S+\u03bc)IS,where all variables and parameters are defined as before and p denotes the proportion of infected individuals who develop symptoms. The two limiting cases of a solely asymptomatic or symptomatic infection occur in the limits p\u21920 and p\u21921 respectively. In fact, the two models are identical when p=\u03b4=0 or in the limit \u03b4\u2192\u221e with p=1. The average residence time in the asymptomatic state differs in both models, with Model II yielding a longer residence time of 1/(\u03b3A+\u03bc).",

The basic reproduction number is a characteristic of the disease and can be estimated from incidence date. In contrast, it is all but impossible to estimate the transmission rate and, accordingly, R0 is fixed and the above expression is used to determine the transmission rate for Model II,(11)\u03b2AII=(\u03b3A+\u03bc)(\u03b3S+\u03bc)(1-p)(\u03b3S+\u03bc)+cp(\u03b3A+\u03bc)R0,where it is assumed that \u03b2SII=c\u03b2AII. On comparison with the transmission rate for the basic model (4) we see that, with all other parameters fixed by the observed disease dynamics, the two models yield unique transmission rates. So that, for a fixed value of R0, the two models will yield different transmission rates.

To compare the two models we write \u03b2AII=F(\u03b4,p)\u03b2A where(12)F(\u03b4;p)=(\u03b3A+\u03bc)(\u03b3S+\u03bc+c\u03b4)(\u03b4+\u03b3A+\u03bc)[(1-p)(\u03b3S+\u03bc)+cp(\u03b3A+\u03bc)],which contains the information about the different distribution of cases between the two models.

However, the presence of silent spreaders, in the form of asymptomatically infected individuals, can severely undermine potential control strategies. In particular, such individuals can have a profound impact on immunologically naive or compromised populations, such as those in schools and health care facilities, where unavoidable close contact encounters can lead to the rapid spread of an infection. Disease transmission by asymptomatic individuals was documented in such settings during the 2009 outbreak [20], [21]. Furthermore, viral shedding during the preclinical stage of infection was confirmed to occur in approximately 1\u20138% of infections [22] and preclinical transmission was also recorded in early H1N1 outbreaks [23]. Mathematical models have demonstrated how preclinical transmission can influence the magnitude of outbreaks in large closed populations, such as schools, workplaces and military facilities, and highlights the importance of such transmission in the decision process [24]. In particular, a greater transmission ability during the preclinical period has been associated with children [25] and this increases the need to understand the effects of this state on the disease pathway. In this section we investigate the behaviour of the two models previously discussed for the specific case of the influenza virus. In particular, we consider the impact of a simple public health intervention applicable to large closed populations, where the easily identifiable clinical cases are isolated from the general population.",

However, while it is widely acknowledged that asymptomatic infection is common, the ability of such individuals to efficiently transmit has been questioned, due to the low levels of viral shedding in such cases [22], [27], [28]. So as not to overestimate the asymptomatic contribution we take the value c=10. For modelling purposes, the proportion of infected individuals developing symptoms is commonly taken as approximately two thirds [4], [5], [29]. Justification for this choice is rarely provided, however, a recent review of experimental studies in which volunteer exposure to wild-type influenza virus was examined determined that the frequency of symptom development was 66.9% [30]. We adopt this assumption and set p=0.67.",

            "text": "The course of infection for influenza is not fully understood. The primary uncertainty surrounds the incubation period and the possibility that it is longer than the latent period resulting in asymptomatic individuals who are infectious [1]. A mean incubation period of 2.05 days was estimated from laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 in the United Kingdom [31]. Viral shedding has been detected on average one day after inoculation with the influenza virus indicating that a latent period of approximately 1 day precedes the onset of infectiousness [30]. Accordingly, the duration of the preclinical infectious state is approximately 1 day and we take \u03b4=1\n day\u22121, in agreement with experimental observations [30]. We neglect the latent period in our analysis as it essentially introduces a delay into the system and rarely results in qualitatively different dynamics [13], [15]. Infected individuals are commonly assumed to recover from clinical illness after an average period of 4 days and we set \u03b3S=0.25\n day\u22121\n[4], [32], [33]. This estimate is predominantly derived from studies that estimate the average duration of viral shedding and represents a rather conservative estimate. One could also use values derived from estimates of the mean serial interval, which in general have been somewhat lower, approximately 3 days, depending on the viral strain [33]. The duration of infectiousness for an asymptomatic case is unknown but previous modelling studies have taken it to be half that of a symptomatic case [34], [35] and we also adopt this assumption, taking \u03b3A=0.5\n day\u22121. The choice of a 2 day duration for the asymptomatic state yields a probability of progressing to a symptomatic state given by \u03b4/(\u03b3a+\u03b4+\u03bc)\u22480.67, in agreement with the corresponding probability in Model II of p=0.67. With the above choice of parameters, the average residence times in the asymptomatic state predicted by the basic model and Model II are approximately 2/3 day and 2 days respectively. It should be noted that, although the basic model yields a significantly shorter residence time, all infected individuals pass through this state and are capable of eluding intervention attempts while preclinical and silently spreading the infection within a susceptible population.",

This initial condition corresponds to one symptomatically infected person in a completely susceptible population of size N-1. A population of N=104 is taken in all simulations. The solutions are qualitatively similar, however, Model II yields a higher peak incidence. Significantly, identical transmission rates does not produce quantitatively identical disease incidence and the partitioning of the population into unique disease states is an important factor in the modelling process. In fact, there will still be differences between the models in the generation time, as well in several other quantities, such as the expected number of cases generated by an asymptotic individual. The delay observed in the basic model is invariably due to the delay introduced by all newly infected individuals being required to first pass through the asymptomatic state prior to symptom onset and the reduced transmission therein. The reverse occurs when the initial infectious seed is asymptomatic. The solution with initial conditions S(0)=1-1/N, IA(0)=1/N and IS(0)=0 is plotted in Fig. 5\n. Under this scenario, the delay in symptomatic cases is observed to occur in Model II. This can be attributed to the relatively small transmission potential of the asymptomatic cases and the resultant time taken for the infection to gain a foothold in the population. Whereas, some of the initially asymptomatic individuals in the basic model quickly transition to the symptomatic cases and can start transmitting the infection more efficiently.",

The reason for this delay was discussed in the previous section. The endemic equilibria as a function of \u03b4 are plotted in Fig. 10\n. The equilibria coincide when \u03b4=\u03b4c=1. When \u03b4<1, and the duration of the preclinical state exceeds 1 day, the basic model predicts a larger endemic value for IA and a smaller value for IS. The opposite is true when the preclinical state is shorter than 1 day, \u03b4>1. This indicates that, in the long term behaviour of influenza, the disease burden could be over or under estimated if the duration of the preclinical state is not accurately known. Better estimates of this parameter could yield more reliable predictions.",

            "text": "Deterministic models with vital dynamics have been shown to exhibit damped oscillations about an endemic disease state for childhood diseases [13], [15]. Influenza has a relatively short infectious period and small reproduction number compared with such infections (measles, rubella, etc.). As a consequence, the disease dynamics of influenza are sufficiently rapid that vital dynamics are typically neglected as they are inadequate to replenish the pool of susceptible individuals quickly enough for the infection to persistent in the population. The classic childhood diseases also confer permanent immunity on those previously infected and consequently such diseases are largely restricted to the immunologically naive child population. Conversely, the waning immunity associated with influenza results in individuals of all ages being susceptible to infection at the beginning of each flu season. This implies that the repopulation of the susceptible class through loss of immunity may be an important contributing mechanism driving damped oscillations in the case of influenza, Fig. 9.",

            "text": "It has been proposed that the long term seasonal variation in influenza incidence is the result of small seasonal variations in an external stimulus which resonates with the intrinsic period of oscillation [38]. This external stimulus was neglected in the previous discussion, where the intent was to highlight the intrinsic oscillations. The endemic equilibria only exist when either \u03b1 or \u03bc are nonzero so that the susceptible compartment can be repopulated following an outbreak. The period of oscillation of the damped oscillations can be approximated by 2\u03c0/q, where q is the complex part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the endemic equilibria. The approximate period is plotted as a function of duration of acquired immunity in Fig. 11\n. For acquired immunity lasting up to 4 years an intrinsic period of less than 2.5 years is observed for the basic model, which can clearly resonate with an annually forced seasonal transmission rate. As immunity becomes permanent (\u03b1\u21920) the system exhibits a period of approximately 10.6 years (Fig. 11 insert) indicating that natural birth/death processes alone are not sufficient to produce a period that will resonate with an annual seasonal stimulus. The differing periods observed between the basic model and Model II explains the out-of-phase oscillation observed in previous simulations (Fig. 9).",

The sole pharmaceutical measure available to public health authorities to alleviate the pandemic impact is the use of antiviral drugs for therapeutic or prophylactic use. It is possible that health systems would have to reply on these drugs for several months while a vaccine is developed and, thus, their timely availability in sufficient quantities to meet international requirements would be crucial. Such a demand could only be met if the drugs were stockpiled in advance of a pandemic [47], [48]. If a highly virulent drug-resistant strain were to emerge the economic impact of losing valuable stockpiles would further devastate already overburdened health systems. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the emergence of drug resistance is an important topic in the preparation for future pandemic outbreaks. It has been shown that widespread use of antiviral drugs should be avoided during a pandemic, except in the case of high reproduction number, to prevent a more virulent drug-resistant strain developing [49]. This theory is supported by our findings. The existence and stability of the two strains are completely determined by the values of the reproduction numbers R1 and R2. The greater the reproduction number of the drug-sensitive strain the greater the reproduction number required by the drug-resistant strain to become endemic in the population. If the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is close to 1 then a lower value of R2 can allow the drug-resistant strain to become endemic.",

It was shown that the dynamics of the simple model without intervention are entirely determined by the basic reproduction number R0, with the disease becoming endemic when R0>1 and dying out when R0<1. In addition, it was demonstrated that the long-term dynamics are characterised by damped oscillations approaching an endemic state, whose period of oscillation is greatly influenced by the rate at which infection acquired immunity is lost. A comparison was provided between this model and another commonly used model in which the preclinical infectious state is absent. It was shown that, for the general model, two unique transmission rates are obtained. For the specific case of influenza the transmission rates are equal, however, the models still predict quantitatively different disease incidence. By considering a simple public health intervention, where the easily identifiable symptomatic cases are isolated from the general population, it was shown that, under certain conditions, neglecting the preclinical state could underestimate the peak incidence and the resultant burden on public health systems during an epidemic. Better estimates for the duration of preclinical viral shedding could help to provide more accurate estimates for the impact of pre-symptomatic influenza transmission. We emphasis that the two models considered here cannot be directly compared and we merely present the two approaches and highlight their similarities and differences.",

In addition to the locally stable disease free equilibrium, two other endemic equilibria were identified. The first corresponds to the presence of the resistant strain when R2>1 and, for influenza parameter values, is locally stable when R2>R1. The second corresponds to the co-circulation of both the drug-sensitive and resistant strains when R1>1 and R2<R1. Elaboration of the second endemic equilibrium is mathematically intractable. However, a graphical analysis of the stability properties, in the case of influenza, indicates that it is always locally stable. We note, however, that the effects of back-mutation from resistant to sensitive strains was neglected. This might possibly occur when the resistant strain carries a cost and is the reason underlying the fact that there is an equilibrium where only the resistant strain is present and no equilibrium with only the sensitive strain.",
