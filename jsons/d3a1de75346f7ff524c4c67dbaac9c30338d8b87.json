Models predict that the number of patients that will require a ventilator ranges between 1.4 and 31 patients per available ventilator [1] . Given this potential, numerous groups have proposed modification of ventilator circuit to enable using a single ventilator to support multiple patients. Previous works demonstrated the feasibility of this method in models of healthy lungs, animals, and healthy volunteers [2] [3] [4] . In the current study, we used lung models with varying compliances, to investigate whether such simultaneous ventilation is feasible.",

These were connected to two test lungs. The same ventilator connected separately to each lung was used to evaluate the compliance of each test lung. The measured compliances were 37 ml/ cmH 2 O and 24 ml/cmH 2 O (Fig. 1) . These correspond to compliance previously described in COVID-19 patients [5] . We used volume control and pressure control modes set to 1000 mL tidal volume (T V ; 500 mL per lung) and 20 cmH 2 O above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respectively. We used the respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min and PEEP of 8 cmH 2 O, and peak pressure alarm was set to 40 cmH 2 O. We monitored the T V and peak pressure of the combined lungs with the ventilator and of each lung separately using a FlowAnalyser PF-300 (Imtmedical\u00a9, Buchs, Switzerland). To evaluate the effects of complications such as tube blockage, we recorded the alarms during one lung obstruction.",

Under such conditions, the standards of care for an individual patient may be reduced to allow caring for more patients. However, we found that simultaneous ventilation of patients with different lung compliance prevents appropriate monitoring of pulmonary mechanics, T V , plateau, and driving pressures. This may preclude safe lung-protective ventilation. As the lung compliance varies greatly in different patients with respiratory failure, simultaneous ventilation of two or more patients with significant differences of their lung physiology may lead to major differences in the delivered T V s. A possible solution would be to assign patients to common ventilators based on lung compliance. However, this seems very complicated and timeconsuming. Furthermore, even if applied, patients may deteriorate or recover at different rates causing previously similar lungs to drift apart.",
