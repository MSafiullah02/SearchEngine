Developing a new entertainment product is often a time-consuming process that can span years. At the point of greenlighting an idea, producers need to have an eye on multiple factors that, at a much later time, will surround the introduction of the product and influence its reception by consumers. Knowing and understanding these factors allows the producer to vary the speed of the innovation process (to accelerate it or to slow it down) to meet the \u201cright\u201d window in time, but also to completely abandon a project if he or she senses that this window is closed and won\u2019t re-open in the foreseeable future.

The script for the western movie Unforgiven was written in 1976. It was purchased by Clint Eastwood in 1983, who then delayed transforming it into a film for almost a decade (Schickel 1996). Mr. Eastwood, an artist, did not offer analytical arguments except that he felt \u201ctoo young\u201d to portray the lead character. But his decision corresponded with the insight that the revisionist nature of the story felt much more timely in the 1990s, when westerns had become a rarity for both for the actor and Hollywood in general. Only in such a modern cultural environment, this film could be appreciated for looking back on the now defunct genre and reflecting on its na\u00efve stereotypes, providing an explanation of its demise, and also as a revision of Mr. Eastwood\u2019s own (now long \u201cretired\u201d) historic western persona known for its violence.

Brewer et al.

Back then, Hollywood studios \u201cviewed the hot weather months as a time when people were too busy traveling or frolicking outdoors and not typically inclined to go to the movies\u201d (Canning 2010, p. 531).7 So why was Jaws, the expensive inaugural \u201cblockbuster\u201d movie,8 released in the summer, if it was considered a low-demand period? Not because of a manager\u2019s vision, but because of an accident: the movie was scheduled to be released in the winter of 1974, but ran over time and budget, and Universal, the producing studio, was too impatient to wait another six months to get reimbursed by moviegoers.",

Figure 13.2 also displays deviations in the box office for the exact same week over the 2010\u20132014 period, and it is probable that these variations, which are quite strong for several weeks, were caused by the products that were released in the respective periods in a given year.

Using a data set of almost 2,000 movies that were released in North American theaters between 1985 and 1999, he estimated a nested logic demand model to separate the part of success that can be attributed to the movie characteristics that determine the commercial appeal of a film (such as the production budget, advertising spending, and genres) from the \u201ctrue\u201d underlying demand effect. His findings, which he corroborates with several robustness analyses, provide evidence of the existence of supply-side effects\u2014and that their size is managerially relevant. Specifically, he estimates that about one-third of the seasonal variation in movie ticket sales in his data is caused by the kinds of movies that managers choose to show at a given point in time.",

Interchannel cannibalization provides an argument for postponing the release of a product in a channel that has a lower margin so as not to hurt the higher margins generated in the other (previous) channel. For books, Clerides (2002) offers evidence of such an effect and insight into its size. When he studies sales patterns for about 500 books by an American publisher that were released in both hardcover and paperback format, he finds that when the paperback release is delayed (which happened in three out of four cases), hardcovers accounted for 38% of total book sales, whereas hardcover sales are only 12% of total book sales when both formats are introduced simultaneously.",

To ensure a high level of realism, the movies from which participants chose were nine actual films that were forthcoming at that time (e.g., X-Men 3, Chronicles of Narnia, The DaVinci Code).40 The consumption options differed with regard to the channel, but also other key characteristics, namely the price, the availability of \u201cextras\u201d (like a \u201cMaking Of\u201d featurette), and the language options.

For the financial forces of costs of waiting and the revenue allocation of each channel, we made assumptions based on real-world observations.41 Using cutting-edge conjoint techniques, for each of the three countries, we examined all 875 alternative channel configurations and determined which channel an individual consumer would have chosen. When we aggregated this information across all 500+ participants, and calculated how these choices, under the assumptions of our study, would have impacted producer revenues, we learned the following:Compared with the standard channel configuration that was in play at the time of our study (a six-month theatrical window followed by a release on DVD retail and rental, and another six-month window until the EST release), producers could increase their revenues substantially via alternative channel configurations. For the three countries we studied, we found configurations that promised between 11.6% and 16.2% higher revenues. In other words, considering alternative distribution models indeed bears the potential for substantial revenue increases for producers of entertainment.Optimal distribution configurations for producers varied strongly between countries\u2014and probably still do. The best scenario for a producer in the U.S. was a simultaneous release in theaters, DVD rental, and EST,42 followed by a DVD sales release just three months later. In Fig. 13.6, we report the resulting effects for producers (as well as the different distributors) and contrast them with the results for Germany\u2014where the ideal model was an exclusive theatrical release, followed by a DVD retail release three months later, with another nine-month wait before a film is released on DVD rental and VOD. Consumer preferences regarding channels vary between countries, and channel solutions need to acknowledge such heterogeneity. But we acknowledge that having different distribution patterns in different parts of the world carries its own challenges, given that in today\u2019s digital age, entertainment travels fast between continents.\nIn all the revenue-maximizing configurations for producers, at least one distributor faced shrinking revenues, and sometimes these losses would be substantial. The figure shows that in the simultaneous release scenario in the U.S., theaters would lose more than 40% of their revenues; in the producer-optimal German scenario, theaters would gain, but DVD rental would have shrunk by almost a third.\u201cWin-win\u201d compromise scenarios, in which producers benefit, but no other channel is hurt, also exist. For the U.S., a three-month window between theaters and DVD retail, followed by another three-month delay before a film becomes available on DVD rental and VOD, would increase the producer revenues by 7% (compared to the baseline constellation) without harming theaters. Studying the development of the market over the last decade, it seems to us that the film industry is moving toward the adoption of this type of compromise model. But compromises, by definition, require some players to forgo an even more profitable constellation for a greater good. This implies that the system will experience instability, because who doesn\u2019t want a greater slice of the pie?\n",

Because music involvement drives both legal and illegal behaviors (which tends to inflate the piracy effect due to endogeneity), scholars have used instrumental variables (which should facilitate file sharing, but not affect legal consumption)47 instead of the raw amount of illegal consumption.

He combined sales data with each area\u2019s Internet penetration, as a measure for the amount of file sharing in the area.48 Liebowitz finds that sales and Internet penetration are strongly linked and estimates that the attractions of the Internet are responsible for an average decline of 1.55 albums sold per consumer in 2003. But how much of that effect can be attributed to illegal activities such as file sharing? Comparing album sales with changes of other non-Internet-based media activities (such as TV consumption), Liebowitz estimates that about 76% of that decline (or 1.19 albums) are caused by file sharing.",

The framework consists of four main categories of piracy determinants:The utility consumers expect to derive from the legal format, including both the gross utility and the costs associated with its consumption. The higher the legal format\u2019s utility, the less a consumer will be inclined to prefer the illegal copy.The costs consumers associate with the acquisition and consumption of the pirated format. The general logic here is that the higher the costs of the illegal format, the lower its utility and the less a consumer will be inclined to prefer the illegal copy. Higher knowledge about file sharing enables consumers to expend less effort to retrieve illegal copies, thereby making them more attractive.The specific utility of the illegal format. The higher such utility, the more a consumer will be inclined to prefer the illegal copy.Finally, the degree to which consumers consider the legal and the pirated format as substitutes.

Apple provided songs and albums (and later movies) for sale via iTunes from 2001 on, Spotify began to offer a legal music flat rate, and Netflix popularized legal streaming of films and series. All these offers were considered valuable by consumers with regard to price and quality, but they also copied the benefits of the illegal offers (e.g., access via the Internet, anytime access to large repertoires in the case of Spotify and Netflix). It was only afterward that the studios embraced such formats, and some still do so only halfheartedly.

This economic logic also applies directly to file sharing networks: an increase in the attractiveness of legal formats reduces the attractiveness of illegal formats by shrinking the illegal network in terms of the people who make content available, limiting the number of available pirated copies of a product.

In this chapter, we have shed light on three fundamental distribution-related issues that entertainment managers are dealing with today, based on insights generated by theoretical and empirical studies: the timing of a new product\u2019s initial release, the orchestration of the plethora of channels that today exist for most entertainment products, and the threat of illegal offerings.",

The current distribution models are based on decade-old logic, with resistance toward change being the main force behind them. The industry has tampered with new models, but in an ad hoc way, and we agree with critical voices from within the industry that such power-driven changes could massively harm entertainment, at least in the longer run. We showed that scholars have taken a much more systematic approach by identifying the macro- and micro-level factors that should be considered when valuing alternative distribution models. Approaches that consider these factors indicate that huge gains are available for the producer at the cost of certain distributors, but that also distribution models exist in which producers win, but no distributor loses. The main learning here is that solutions inspired by Entertainment Science, that account for the hyper-complex channel relations that exist in today\u2019s entertainment world, should be preferred over gut-feeling-based approaches.",

We summarized rich insights into the drivers of consumer piracy, which also should guide managers when developing anti-piracy measures. The evidence is pretty clear that increasing the utility (and/or decreasing the costs) of legal copies is a promising path\u2014one that entertainment firms have neglected for a long time in efforts to protect their traditional channels and which they still seem to be embracing only half-heartedly. These strategies also come with the side benefit of enhancing the entertainment firm\u2019s reputation, which further decreases consumers\u2019 motivations to pirate their content. Strategies that focus on blocking access to pirated content seem to support such efforts, whereas approaches that reduce the value of the legal product by adding restrictions are not recommended.",
