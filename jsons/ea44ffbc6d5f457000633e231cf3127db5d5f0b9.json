Infectious diseases, also known as transmissible diseases or communicable diseases, comprise clinically evident illness (i.e., characteristic medical signs and/or symptoms of disease) resulting from the infection, presence, and growth of pathogenic biological agents in an individual host organism. Infections are caused by infectious agents such as viruses, and prions, microorganisms such as bacteria. Proteins might be involved in causing a disease as well as protecting the host from it. Various membrane proteins of microorganisms (virus, bacteria, parasites, etc.), prions are responsible for causing different diseases. Proteins like heat shock proteins/chaperons aid in causing as well as protecting from diseases. Proteins might also be involved in playing solely protective roles against infections like various cell surface receptor proteins (Toll-like receptors, Nod-like receptors, etc.), which trigger protective immune responses.

Bacterial infections are usually initiated by adherence of the microbe to a specific epithelial surface of the host, otherwise the organism will get removed: (1) Fimbrial adhesions involved in mediating attachment of some bacteria to mammalian cell surfaces, e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae use pilli to adhere to the mucous membrane of urethra and can resist the flushing action of urine [1, 2] . (2) Nonfimbrial adhesion including the filamentous hemagglutinin of Bordetella pertussia helping in attachment to respiratory epithelium, a mannose-resistant hemagglutinin produced by Salmonella typhimurium and a fibrillar hemagglutinin from Helecobacter pylori [3, 4] . Other adhesions like Protein F produced by Streptococcus pyogenes, aiding in attachment to pharyngeal epithelium [5] . Some extracellular bacterial proteins considered invasins like hyaluronidase, produced by Streptococci, Staphylococci, and Clostridia, which degrades hyaluronic acid of connective tissue [6, 7] , collagenase produced by Clostridium sp, which dissolves collagen framework of muscles [8] , neuraminidase produced by Vibrio cholerae and Shigella dysenteriae, which degrades neuraminic acid of intestinal mucosa [9] . Other extracellular proteins like invasive enzymes, e.g., coagulase, contributes to the formation of fibrin walls around staphylococcal lesions [10] ; exotoxins (proteins released extracellularly), like neurotoxin (Tetanus toxin, by Clostridium tetani, Botulinum toxin by Clostridium botulinum) [11] and cytotoxins (Diphtheria toxin produced by Corynebacterium dipthereae) [12, 13] , also known as A-B toxins (consisting of 2 subunits: one binds to cell surface receptor and the other is transferred into the cell to damage the cell) [14] , cytolytic toxins (attacking cell constituents causing lysis) like hemolysins produced by Bordetella pertussis, inducing apoptosis of host cells, super antigen toxins (e.g., superantigen, sized 22KDa produced by 5-25 % of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, causing toxic shock syndrome (TSS) by stimulating the release of large amounts of interleukin-1, interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor, etc.) [15] . Enterotoxins (exotoxins that act on the small intestine, generally causing massive secretion of fluid into the intestinal lumen, leading to vomiting and diarrhea) produced by Vibrio cholerae, E. coli O157:H7. Endotoxins (generally cell-bound toxins released only when cells are lysed) produced by most Gram-negative bacteria are generally nonproteinaceous, lipopolysaccharide in nature [16] (Fig. 8.1 ).",

The addition of sugar chains or glycosylation of the protein surface-components, can happen either at asparagine, and is termed N-glycosylation, or at hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, serine, or threonine, and is termed O-glycosylation. Glycosylation is often present in proteins that are at least in part located in extracellular space. The sugar group can assist in protein folding or improve its stability. Glycoproteins also aid in immune cell recognition. Viral glycoproteins are composed of three parts: External/Ecto-domain, which interacts with host; Transmembrane segment, which spans the viral envelope membrane, typically \u03b1-helix; and Endo-domain, the internal part. Ecto-domain can be of two classes: Class I, found in Orthomyxoviruses, Paramyxoviruses, Retroviruses, Filoviruses and Coronaviruses; Class II, found in Flaviviruses and Alphaviruses. Other types of ecto-domains that do not fit in class I and II are Glycoprotein B (gB) of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Glycoprotein G of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

Viral glycoproteins are oligomers that are associated with each other to form tetramers, etc. There are often the spikes seen on the virus surface. Some glycoproteins such as the influenza hemagglutinin are anchored at both ends, thus forming a loop. In such cases a signal sequence at the amino end has been removed. There are two types of glycoproteins: External glycoprotein anchored in the envelope by a single transmembrane domain, and a short internal tail. These proteins are usually the major antigens of the virus and involved in functions such as hemagglutination, receptor binding, and membrane fusion. The other classes are channel proteins, which are mostly hydrophobic proteins that form a protein lined channel through the envelope. This protein alters permeability of the membrane (e.g., ion channel). Such proteins are important in modifying the internal environment of the virus [21] [22] [23] [24] (Fig. 8.2 ).",

Ten human TLRs have been identified, from TLR 1 through 10, with important roles in host defense against bacteria, viruses, and fungi [25, 26] . They recognize a large array of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including peptidoglycan, lipoproteins, lipopeptides, phenol-soluble modulin, lipoteichoic acid, lipoarabinomannan, atypical lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), porins, flagellin, heat shock proteins (HSP), lycoinositol phospholipids, glycolipids, zymosan, also nucleic acids like double-stranded RNA of viruses, etc. [27, 28] .

This phosphorylation leads to the dissociation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB is a transcription factor involved in upregulation of genes responsible for both the innate and adaptive immune responses, e.g., genes involved in T cell development, maturation, and proliferation, cell apoptosis, etc. Similarly, in the MyD88independent pathway an adaptor molecule named TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP)/MyD88-adaptor-like (Mal) is involved (Fig. 8.3 ).",

NLRX1 contains a CARD-related X effector domain. Among the NLRs, NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP12, NLRC4, and NAIP have been reported to operate via inflammasomes. Other NLRs such as NOD1, NOD2, NLRP10, NLRX1, NLRC5, and CIITA do not directly engage the inflammatory caspases, but instead activate nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) to stimulate innate immunity [32] . NOD-like receptors have been described as master regulators of innate immunity. NLRs are essential in recognition of microbial-and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs and PAMPs), and have the ability to initiate and support robust immune responses through the formation of inflammasomes and the activation of NF-kB, IRF, and MAPK pathways. Functions such as the enhancement of MHC transcription and presentation implicate NLRs in adaptive immunity, and their roles in reproduction indicate a broader responsibility of this gene family than previously suspected. The potency of NLRs in inducing immune defenses is vital for the host, but can also provide serious problems when dysregulation or malfunction occurs (Fig. 8.4 ).",

            "text": "Microorganisms frequently change the pH of their own habitat by producing acidic or basic metabolic waste products. If the external pH decreases to 4.5 or lower, chaperones such as acid shock proteins and heat shock proteins are synthesized. Chaperones were first discovered because they dramatically increased in concentration when cells were exposed to high temperatures, metabolic poisons, and other stressful conditions. Thus many chaperones are often called heat shock proteins or stress proteins. Heat shock proteins influence infectious disease processes in a number of diverse ways: they are involved in the propagation of prions, replication and morphogenesis of viruses, and resistance of parasites to chemotherapy. Several heat shock proteins function as intracellular chaperones for other proteins. They play an important role in protein-protein interactions such as folding and assisting in establishment of proper protein conformation (shape) and prevention of unwanted protein aggregation. By helping to stabilize partially unfolded proteins, HSPs aid in transporting proteins across membranes within the cell [35] . These proteins also appear to be important mediators of bacteria-host interactions and inflammation, the latter via interactions with cell surface molecules and structures such as Toll-like receptors and lipid rafts. Heat shock proteins can be expressed on the surface of infected cells, and this is likely to provide a target for the innate immune response. Elevated levels of circulating HSP are present in infectious diseases and these proteins might therefore regulate inflammatory responses to pathogenic challenge on a systemic basis [36] . For many years it was believed that polypeptides would spontaneously fold into their final native shape, either as they were synthesized by ribosomes or shortly after completion of protein synthesis. Although the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide does determine its final conformation, it is now clear that special helper proteins aid the newly formed or nascent polypeptide in folding to its proper shape [37] . These proteins, called molecular chaperones, recognize only unfolded polypeptides or partly denatured proteins and do not bind to normal, functional proteins. Their role is essential because the cytoplasmic matrix is filled with nascent polypeptide chains and proteins. Under such conditions it is quite likely that new polypeptide chains often will fold improperly and aggregate to form nonfunctional complexes. Molecular chaperones are key players of the homeostasis of the proteome network and suppress incorrect folding and may reverse any incorrect folding that has already taken place [38] . Therefore, their expression and the activity are tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational level at various age-related diseases (e.g., degenerative diseases and cancer) [39] .",

The protein that prions are made of (PrP) is found throughout the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrP C , while the infectious form is called PrP Sc -the C refers to 'cellular' or 'common' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep [46] . A prion in the Scrapie form (PrP Sc ) is an infectious agent composed of protein in a misfolded form [47] . So, they are not considered living organisms but may propagate by transmitting a misfolded protein state. If a prion enters a healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins to convert into the disease-associated, prion form; the prion acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more proteins into prion form. These newly formed prions can then go on to convert more proteins themselves; this triggers a chain reaction that produces large amounts of the prion form [48] . This altered structure is extremely stable and accumulates in infected tissue, causing tissue damage and cell death [49] . All long-term hematopoietic stem cells express PrP on their cell membrane and those hematopoietic tissues with PrP-null stem cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cell depletion [50] .",

Christopher Johnson and his team describe experiments with lichens, symbiotic collections of algae, fungus, and bacteria that casual observers might mistake for moss. Three common species of lichens, the team has found, exude an enzyme that breaks down the prion. They showed that these lichen extracts efficiently degrade disease-associated prion protein (PrPTSE), the probable etiological agent of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), and suggest that some lichens could have potential to inactivate TSE infectivity on the landscape or be a source for agents to degrade prions [51] .",
