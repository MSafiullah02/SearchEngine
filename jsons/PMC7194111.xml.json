            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV), first isolated from a rhesus monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 (Dick, G W et al., 1952; Routhu, N Kim et al., 2018), is a mosquito-borne, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA arbovirus, and a member of the Flavivirus family (Tham et al., 2018). The ZIKV genome encodes three structural proteins (C, prM/M, and E) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (Hamel et al., 2015). ZIKV infection has been associated with several central nervous system diseases, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and meningoencephalitis, which are especially harmful to the immature nervous system, and could cause congenital microcephaly in the offspring of pregnant woman (Perez-Cabezas et al., 2019). Scientists have been working on anti-ZIKV research, and most research on drugs is mainly focused on antibody drugs, small-molecule compounds and peptide drugs. Many vaccine candidates have been identified in clinical research, such as DNA vaccines, mRNA vaccines, inactivated virions and viral vectors (Diamond et al., 2019). However, vaccination may cause important issues, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and recent FDA approved drug screenings have indicated that many drugs can effectively suppress ZIKV, including candesartan cilexetil (Loe et al., 2019), pinocembrin (Lee et al., 2019), aurintricarboxylic acid (Park et al. 2019), ribavirin and sofosbuvir. However, how to protect pregnant women safely and effectively poses a substantial challenge for the development of small-molecule drugs. Although ribavirin can effectively inhibit ZIKV replication (Kim et al., 2018), it is not yet widely available because it could cause haemolytic anaemia when administered orally over a long term (Russmann et al., 2006). Research has reported that sofosbuvir can also inhibit ZIKV infection (Reznik and Ashby, 2017), but it is not suitable for use in developing countries because of its cost (Bausch et al., 2010).",

In addition, lycorine inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication by inhibiting the expression of hsc70 in host cells (Chen et al., 2015). Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is suppressed by treatment with lycorine, which interferes with viral polyproteins during elongation (Liu et al., 2011). Furthermore, lycorine inhibits the translocation of the ribonucleoprotein complex from the nucleus in the early stages of influenza virus H5N1 single-cycle and multicycle replication (He et al., 2013). In the present study, we assessed the anti-ZIKV activity of lycorine in vitro and in vivo. This comprehensive assessment provided new candidate inhibitors to effectively treat ZIKV infections.",

The qRT-PCR results showed that 1 \u03bcM lycorine displayed the strongest ability to decrease the vRNA and viral progeny particle load between -2 and 10 hpi (Fig. 2\nA). Analysis of the infectious viral proteins in the cells revealed that lycorine reduced viral protein synthesis (Fig. 2B), which coincides with postentry events in the ZIKV replication cycle. Therefore, we hypothesized that lycorine interferes with the translation and replication of vRNA, and we performed Time-of-removal assay to test this hypothesis. First, lycorine was added at 6 hpi, prior to any significant vRNA synthesis. Compared to DMSO treatment, lycorine treatment fully abrogated vRNA synthesis (Fig. 2C). Next, we added lycorine at 24 hpi and monitored the kinetics of ZIKV replication for an additional 12 h. At this point, viral replication compartments in infected cells are already established. As shown in Fig. 2D, lycorine had no effect on vRNA under these conditions. We also observed similar results for the viral protein level with vRNA (Fig. 2E\u20132F). Virus E protein was reduced by 52% and NS5 protein was reduced by 89% after 24 h of viral infection (Fig. 2G\u20132H). Lycorine was added at 24 hpi, no significant difference in viral E and NS5 protein reduction (Fig. 2I\u20132J).

Tagg values of NS5 in Vero cell lysates were measured in the absence or presence of lycorine at temperatures ranging from 33 to 53.8 \u00b0C (Fig. 4\nA). The CETSA showed that lycorine treatment increased the thermal stability of NS5, markedly increasing the Tagg of the NS5 protein from 44.6 to 47.8 \u00b0C (Fig. 4B). These results confirmed that lycorine binds directly to NS5 and protects it from thermally induced aggregation. To further explore whether lycorine inhibits RdRp activity, we performed in vitro RNA polymerase assays and found that lycorine directly inhibited RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Molecular modelling and docking studies further showed the structural basis of the lycorine binding interactions with ZIKV RdRp (Fig. 4D). The predicted binding model revealed that lycorine preferably bound to the finger domains of RdRp. Together, these results indicated that lycorine targets NS5 and potently inhibits RdRp activity.",

By 9 dpi, mice in the ZIKV group began to succumb to the infection. In contrast, treatment with lycorine (10 mg/kg) protected against ZIKV infection-induced death by 83%. Lycorine treatment at doses of 5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg enhanced the survival rates of mice to 66% and 33%, respectively. Mice in the lycorine and ZIKV groups began to lose weight by 5 dpi, those in the lycorine group recovered until 9 or 10 dpi, while those in the ZIKV group did not (Fig. 5B). Viral RNA levels in the blood were quantified in all groups at 1,3 and 7 dpi. In our assay, viremia was observed from 1 dpi, with the highest levels being observed at 3 dpi, however the levels of viremia decreased at 7 dpi. Treatment with 1 mg/kg lycorine inhibited viral replication, but did not prolong the survival times of mice to the same extent as treatment with 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg lycorine. The levels of vRNA in the lycorine group were one order of magnitude lower than those in the ZIKV group at 1,3 and 7 dpi. As the concentration of the drug increased, the effect was more pronounced (Fig. 5C\u20135E). The vRNA load in the brain and liver of mice was performed by RT-qPCR. The experiment showed that 10 mg/kg lycorine reduce the vRNA of brain tissue about three orders of magnitude. 5 mg/kg lycorine reduce the vRNA of brain tissue about one order of magnitude, while 1 mg/kg was not significant difference. As for liver tissue, 10 and 5 mg/kg lycorine reduce the vRNA of liver about one and half order of magnitude, respectively. 1 mg/kg was not significant difference. (Fig. 5F\u2013G). Next, we characterized the histopathological lesion changes in the brain and liver by haematoxylin & eosin staining. In the liver tissue, the cells in the ZIKV group were loosely arranged, and not in the form of strips, while cytoplasmic oedema, and hepatic sinus congestion were observed. Mice in the 10 mg/kg lycorine group displayed significantly reduced liver damage compared to those in the 5 mg/kg lycorine group. The inflammatory response of the cells was obvious in the 1 mg/kg lycorine treatment group. In brain tissues in the ZIKV group, the volume of cells was reduced, the nuclei were shrunken, voids were apparent around the cells and a nuclear membrane was present around the gap. In the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups, lycorine significantly reduced the ZIKV-induced inflammatory response. In the 1 mg/kg group, brain tissue lesions were similar to those in the ZIKV group (Fig. 6\n). Overall, these results confirmed the antiviral effect of lycorine treatment against ZIKV in vivo.",

Therefore, the discovery of drugs for ZIKV infection remains a priority. In this study, we demonstrated that lycorine has effective and dose-dependent antiviral activity against ZIKV in ZIKV-permissive cell lines, demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of lycorine is not cell-type-specific. Based on the effectiveness of lycorine against ZIKV infection (SI = 54 in Vero cells, 20 in Huh7 cells and 19.5 in A549 cells) compared to that of other previously described drugs, including suramin (SI ~500 in Vero cells) (Tan et al., 2017), BCX4430 (SI = 11.6 in Vero and 15.7 in Huh7 cells) (Julander et al., 2017), and sofosbuvir (SI > 52.63 in Huh7) (Bullard-Feibelman et al., 2017), lycorine is possibly one of the most reasonable options for the treatment of ZIKV infection.",

Time-of-addition assay can provide a preliminary understanding of the infectious phase upon which lycorine acts, and results indicate that the compound acts on postentry processes of the ZIKV replication cycle.

            "text": "CETSA, which is used to evaluate drug binding to target proteins, is based on the biophysical principle of the ligand-induced thermal stabilization of target proteins (Martinez et al., 2013). One characteristic of the CETSA experiment is the comparison of the melting curve between the control and experimental groups, during which the protein is subjected to a panel of temperatures such that potential thermal stabilization can be assessed (Jafari et al., 2014). The Tagg values of NS5 ranged from 44.6 to 47.8 \u00b0C, which shows that lycorine binds to NS5 and protects its stability. NS5 is the largest nonstructural protein, and contains an N-terminal methyltransferase (MTase) domain and a C-terminal RdRp domain(Lin et al., 2019). The RdRp domain, which interacts with other viral and host factors to form a replicase complex responsible for their replication, is required for RNA synthesis and is essential for flavivirus replication. In a previous experiment, we demonstrated that lycorine inhibits the formation of vRNA. Therefore, we designed in vitro RNA polymerase assays to verify whether lycorine inhibits RdRp activity, and the experiment results showed that lycorine treatment inhibited RdRp activity. RdRp would be an ideal target option for anti-ZIKV infection because human host cells are devoid of RdRp (Lin et al., 2019). Therefore, further studies are required to define the mechanism by which lycorine acts on RdRp. Lycorine inhibits HCV replication by inhibiting HSP70 (Chen et al., 2015) and EV71A by 2A protease (Guo et al., 2016). HSP70 participates in the formation of virus replication complexes (Taguwa et al., 2019). It is possibility that lycorine may inhibit ZIKV replication by inhibiting HSP70 protein. In this assay, we showed that lycorine inhibited ZIKV replication by inhibiting the activity of RdRp by detecting RdRp activity. RdRp also play a role in the replication of ZIKV (Lu et al., 2017). This suggests that there may be multiple targets for lycorine to inhibit ZIKV replication. 2A protease of EV71A is a homologue of dengue NS3 protein. Dengue NS3 protein is similar to ZIKV NS3 protein (Jain et al., 2016). The NS3 protein is activated by the NS2B protein to form NS2B-NS3 proteolytic enzymes, which are involved in the cleavage of ZIKV polyprotein (White et al., 2016). Because there may be multiple targets for the inhibition of ZIKV by lycorine, we performed molecular docking experiments on the possible targets. As shown in the Table 2\n, lycorine has the ability to bind to HSP70 and ZIKV NS3 protein, but the stability is weaker than the positive control. So in order to better clarify the effect of lycorine on HSP70 and ZIKV NS3. More experiments are needed to be.",

Another possibility is that the daily administration of a high concentration of lycorine is required to prolong the survival of ZIKV-infected mice. However, the mechanisms underlying the prolonged survival and mortality outcomes of mice remain unknown. One major issues remain to be addressed for the further development of lycorine. It is a lack of knowledge about the its use of lycorine in pregnant women, and additional safety tests are thus required before lycorine can be used for the treatment of pregnant women. An improved animal model that allows a better estimation of the in vivo potency of lycorine, including non-human primate models, should be established for a preclinical toxicity study that may be beneficial for understanding the antiviral activity of lycorine for its use as a novel antiviral drug.",
