For example, having a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order was a predictor of specialist palliative care in some studies46,59,60 and an outcome in others.54,58 Determining the extent of these limitations was hindered by poor reporting of study methods.",

This was the only study that used a child-reported measure.67 Although three studies suggested that treatment of symptoms increased with specialist involvement,57,74,90 there was little evidence that the extent of symptom control/suffering from physical and emotional symptoms differed between children receiving and not receiving specialist palliative care.

Thus, studies reported fewer children with haematological malignancies receiving specialist palliative care, and involvement more likely where the oncology team were proactively addressing palliative care needs (e.g. evidence of advance care planning). There was no indication from the studies included about why children with certain cancers are less likely to receive specialist palliative care, and a recent review of barriers to access did not explore this.31 Evidence from adult cancer91 indicates that the remitting and relapsing trajectories of haematological malignancies, a more aggressive approach to treatment and greater difficulties predicting prognosis may contribute to the observed inequity of specialist palliative care involvement.92 Evidence from our review regarding clinician uncertainty about when to involve specialist palliative care, combined with the commonly reported practice of referring children with a poor prognosis,27 suggests this might be the case.",

There are, however, limitations in the conclusions which can be drawn from this review due to the heterogeneity of study populations and interventions. This, and the substantial risk of potential bias identified in some of the studies and inconsistency of measurement across studies, meant it was inappropriate to aggregate the results statistically, or to compare results between the different approaches to providing specialist palliative care.

Synthesis of the qualitative studies go some way to explaining these differences, highlighting in particular the central role of clinicians\u2019 emotions, beliefs and attitudes in shaping referral practices, and the ongoing uncertainty about when to initiate palliative care and whether this should be provided by a specialist service or the oncology team. It also reveals that, in practice, decisions and discussions about no longer pursuing curative treatments and introducing specialist palliative care go hand in hand, and that families who are comfortable discussing an uncertain future or families cared for by clinicians who have this confidence may be more likely to receive specialist palliative care.75,77,83",

This conclusion is supported by the recent priority setting partnership results for teenagers and young adults with cancer,103 which includes how best to support young people who have incurable cancer and their families. In order to undertake this research, we must first determine what outcomes are the most important to measure and develop appropriate tools to measure them.104\u2013107 Development of a core outcome set would meet this requirement.108 This too will need to include the views of children and young people and their families, particularly if we are to address the methodological challenges that continue to affect the quality of research in this area, and the lack of evidence about whether specialist paediatric palliative care improves quality of life for children and their families.",
