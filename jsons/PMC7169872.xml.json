The genus Kobuvirus was first established in 1999 and currently contains six officially recognized species, Aichivirus A (formerly Aichi virus), Aichivirus B (formerly Bovine kobuvirus), Aichivirus C (porcine kobuvirus), Aichivirus D (kagovirus 1), Aichivirus E (rabbit picornavirus) and Aichivirus F (bat kobuvirus) (Adams, King, & Carstens, 2013; Adams et al., 2017; Pringle, 1999). Other members of the Kobuvirus genus have been detected in sheep, goats, rodents and wild boar (Lee et al., 2012; Phan et al., 2011; Reuter, Boros, Pankovics, & Egyed, 2010; Reuter et al., 2013). The species Aichivirus A includes six types: Aichi virus, canine kobuvirus, murine kobuvirus, Kathmandu sewage kobuvirus, roller kobuvirus and feline kobuvirus (FeKoV) (Adams et al., 2017).",

Their genome is composed of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a large open reading frame (ORF), and a 3\u2032 UTR.

Carmona\u2010Vicente et al. in 2013 (Carmona\u2010Vicente et al., 2013). Using the Aichi virus as an antigen, IgG antibody to this organism was detected in 67 of 97 cat serum samples, indicating an Aichi virus crossreactive kobuviral infection is common in cats. The first FeKoV molecular evidence was reported in Korea by Joon\u2010Yee Chung et al. in 2013 (Chung et al., 2013). Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR), six of 39 collected faecal samples from Korean cats were confirmed positive for kobuvirus RNA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that FeKoV (12D240, FK\u201013) is most closely related to the canine kobuvirus (Choi et al., 2015). In 2015, Barbara Di Martino et al. screened faecal samples obtained from asymptomatic and diarrhoeic cats for FeKoV RNA in Italy (Di Martino, Profio, Melegari, Marsilio, & Martella, 2015). FeKoV RNA was found in five of 37 diarrhoeic cats but was undetected in asymptomatic cats. The full\u2010length genome sequence of one Italian FeKoV strain (FeKoV/TE/52/IT/13) was sequenced, and it displayed a high nucleotide identity (96.0%) to the Korean strain, FK\u201013.",

Therefore, it is important to investigate and genetically characterize FeKoV infections in other countries to assess the global epidemiology of this emerging virus.

All FeKoV\u2010positive faecal samples were collected from diarrhoeic cats, with a prevalence rate of 8/52, similar to those identified in Korea (6/39) and Italy (5/37) (Chung et al., 2013; Di Martino et al., 2015). No FeKoV was found in asymptomatic cats in this study, nor in another study in Italy. However, a study conducted by Yoon\u2010Young Cho et al. detected FeKoV RNA in healthy cats (two of 19) in Korea in 2015, although a higher prevalence rate of 15/52 was found in diarrhoeic cats (Cho et al., 2015). FeKoV prevalence studies in China, Korea and Italy indicate FeKoV is commonly detected in diarrhoeic cats (Di Martino et al., 2015). In addition, our field study in China indicated FeKoV was positively associated with feline diarrhoea. However, the relationship between FeKoV infection and diarrhoea in cats requires further epidemiological and experimental studies.",

To obtain the FeKoV genome in China, PCR primers with degenerate bases targeting the consensus region of three FeKoV genome sequences were designed using high\u2010fidelity DNA polymerase. Based on these, two long PCR fragments of \u22483,000 and 4,400 bp and a short PCR fragment of \u2248900 bp were acquired to assemble the near\u2010complete genome of the first Chinese FeKoV strain, WHJ\u20101. Our viral sequencing strategy may help to determine the genomic sequences of other FeKoV strains. Moreover, considering the highly genetically variable kobuvirus characteristics, the WHJ\u20101 genomic information may also contribute to the primer design applied to the FeKoV viral detection method.",

The polyprotein gene for the field FeKoV strain, WHJ\u20101, has a nucleotide identity of 93.0%\u201393.2% with that of the Italian and Korean strains, indicating FeKoV's genetic variation during 2013 and 2017. In addition, analysing the WHJ\u20101 polyprotein showed 13 unique amino acid variant sites. Cats are important companion animals who maintain close contact with humans. Previous studies have demonstrated the zoonotic potential of carnivore enteric viruses (Di Martino et al., 2015).
