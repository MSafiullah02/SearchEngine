Because of this, Venkatesh and Memish [4] mentioned that what a country most needed to do is to check its preparation for bioterrorism attacks, especially the perfect extent of the emergency logistics network which includes the reserve and distribution of emergency rescue materials, and the emergency response ability to bioterrorism attacks. Other anti-bioterrorism response relative researches can be found in Kaplan et al. [5].",

Besides, each route wouldn\u2019t repeat, which made any demand point get the emergency materials as fast as possible. To the best of our knowledge, this is a very common experience in China. Under the assumption that any demand point would be satisfied after once replenishment, the question researched would be turn into a multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP) with an immovable origin. In the work of Bektas [14], the author gave a detailed literature review on MTSP from both sides of model and algorithm. Malik et al.

First, nature disaster such as earthquake, typhoons, flood and so on was always used as the background or numerical simulation in the past research, such kind of disaster can disrupt the traffic and lifeline systems, obstructing the operation of rescue machines, rescue vehicles and ambulances. But situation in anti-bioterrorism system is different, traffic would be normal and the epidemic situation could be controlled with vaccination or contact isolation. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to combine research on the biological epidemic model and the emergency materials distribution model, and we assume that emergency logistics network is driven by the biological virus diffusion network. Therefore, it has a different structure from the general logistics network. Third, the new hybrid genetic algorithm we designed and applied in this study is different from all the traditional ways, we improved the two-part chromosome which proposed by Carter and Ragsdale [16], and custom special set order function, crossover function and mutation function, which can find the optimal result effectively.",

Ren et al. [19] presented a multi-city resource allocation model to distribute a limited amount of vaccine to minimize the total number of fatalities due to a smallpox outbreak. He and Liu [20] proposed a time-varying forecasting model based on a modified SEIR model and used a linear programming model to facilitate distribution decision-making for quick responses to public health emergencies. Liu and Zhang [21] proposed a time-space network model for studying the dynamic impact of medical resource allocation in controlling the spread of an epidemic. Further, they presented a dynamic decision-making framework, which coupled with a forecasting mechanism based on the SEIR model and a logistics planning system to satisfy the forecasted demand and minimize the total operation costs [22]. Anparasan and Lejeune [23] proposed an integer linear programming model, which determined the number, size, and location of treatment facilities, deployed medical staff, located ambulances to triage points, and organized the transportation of severely ill patients to treatment facilities. B\u00fcy\u00fcktahtak\u0131n et al. [24] proposed a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to determine the optimal amount, timing and location of resources that are allocated for controlling Ebola in West-Africa.

We formulate the problem to be a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model and develop an effective algorithm to solve the model. Moreover, we test our model through a case study and sensitivity analysis. The main contribution of this research is the function of ESL, which considers demand satisfaction and emergency operation cost simultaneously. Our definition of ESL is different from the existing literature and has a significant meaning for guiding the actual operations in emergency response. Future studies could address the limitations of our work in both the disease forecasting and logistics management. For example, the dynamics of epidemic diffusion could be considered and thus our optimization problem can be extended to a dynamic programming model.",
