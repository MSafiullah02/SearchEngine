As for COVID-19, several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, fatigue, and so on. COVID-19 also has characteristic laboratory findings and lung CT abnormalities [7] . However, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurological manifestations.

In addition, severe patients had multiple organ involvement, such as serious liver (increased lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels), kidney (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels) and skeletal muscle damage (increased creatinine kinase levels).

            "text": "The pathological mechanism may be from the CNS invasion of SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS and MERS virus. Like other respiratory viruses, SARS-COV-2 may enter the CNS through the hematogenous or retrograde neuronal route. The latter can be supported by the fact that some patients in this study had hyposmia. We also found that the lymphocyte counts were lower for patients with CNS symptoms than without CNS symptoms. This phenomenon may be indicative of the immunosuppression in COVID-19 patients with CNS symptoms, especially in the severe subgroup. Moreover, we This preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3544840 found severe patients had higher D-dimer levels than that of non-severe patients. This may be the reason why severe patients are more likely to develop cerebrovascular disease.",

We speculate that the symptom was due to skeletal muscle injury, as confirmed by elevated creatine kinase levels. We found that patients with muscle symptoms had higher creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels than those without muscle symptoms. Furthermore, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels in severe patients were much higher than those of none-severe patients. This injure could be related to ACE2 in skeletal muscle [14] . However, SARS-CoV, using the same receptor, was not detected in skeletal muscle by post-mortem examination [15] . Therefore, whether SARS-CoV-2 infects skeletal muscle cells by binding with ACE2 requires to be further studied. One other reason was the infection-mediated harmful immune response that caused the nervous system abnormalities. Significantly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum may cause skeletal muscle damage.",
