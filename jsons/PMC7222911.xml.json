We also found a significantly higher rate of 30-day readmission in the robotic-assisted gastric bypass cohort (p = 0.03). This is consistent with a large (n = 137,455) retrospective propensity-matched cohort analysis of the Bariatric Outcomes Longitudinal Database (BOLD), where Celio et al. found longer operative time, 30-day reoperation, and 30-day readmission in the robotic-assisted RnYGB cohort [18]. However, after the authors controlled for operative time, 30-day readmission was no longer significant, which is inconsistent with our findings. In our study, we have found that 30-day readmission remained significantly higher in the robotic-assisted cohort, even when controlling for operative time and conversion rate as surrogates for surgeon experience (p = 0.02). Post-operative length of stay between the two surgical approaches has also been a point of contention in the literature. In our study, HLOS was similar between the two surgical approaches for gastric bypass before (p = 0.2) and after (p = 0.08) controlling for operative time and conversion rate. Studies have found both shorter HLOS [13, 19] and longer HLOS [16] in robotic-assisted RnYGB cohorts, while others have reported no difference [14, 15]. While our study represents a large 1:3 case\u2013control cohort analysis comparing surgical approaches between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 12,688), and will likely add value to the discussion, the reasons for differences in readmission rates between these two surgical approaches remain unclear and in need of further study.",

            "text": "In our case\u2013control matched analysis of robotic and laparoscopic gastric bypass, we found significantly lower rates of mortality (p = 0.05), transfusion (p = 0.005), superficial SSI (p = 0.0003), aggregate bleeding (p = 0.04), and aggregate wound infection (p = 0.006) in the robotic cohort. After controlling for operative time and conversion rate, however, only superficial SSI (p = 0.0002) and aggregate wound infection (p = 0.003) remained lower in the robotic-assisted cohort. Regarding 30-day mortality, others have reported no significant difference between these surgical approaches [4, 9, 10, 12, 14\u201319], which is consistent with our study once we account for operative length and conversion rate. A lower rate of SSI following robotic-assisted compared to conventional laparoscopic gastric bypass has not been previously reported [9, 10, 12\u201314, 16, 19]. Similar to our findings, Sebastian et al. analyzed the same data set with propensity-score matching and reported higher rates of bleeding following laparoscopic gastric bypass before and after adjusting for operative time and conversion rate [19]. However, once conversion rate and operative length is accounted for in our case\u2013control study, we have shown no difference in transfusion rate between the two surgical approaches (p = 0.1). This trend toward higher transfusion rate with conventional laparoscopic compared to robotic-assisted RnYGB remains unclear. Possible mechanism may include a higher rate of stapled anastomosis with conventional laparoscopic compared to a higher rate of hand-sewn anastomosis with the robotic-assisted approach. Surgeons may also be more aggressive in suture hemostasis with the robotic-assisted approach due to easier ergonomics and improved visualization with the robotic platform. These patient level data points are not available in this database, and are worthy of future studies. However, even with a significantly higher operative duration, overall complications were less with the robotic-assisted approach for gastric bypass. In our second matched analysis, controlling for operation duration and conversion, there was much less outcome differences between robotic-assisted gastric bypass and conventional laparoscopic gastric bypass, with similar mortality and morbidity rates.",

Many of the studies comparing the cost of conventional laparoscopic versus robotic-assisted surgery do not account for the large initial investment, consumables per procedures, annual maintenance, and other reusable equipment that comprise a substantial portion of the total operating costs of robotic platforms [9, 10, 23]. Because of the growing emphasis on healthcare costs, it is imperative that bariatric surgeons continue to find new and innovative ways to reduce costs associated with the utilization of differently surgical platforms for bariatric surgery without effecting patient outcomes. From our matched analysis, it would appear that even though robotic-assisted RnYGB takes longer, it is associated with better outcomes when compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach, including a lower overall mortality rate, less bleeding complications, and similar leak rates. In contrast, robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy is associated with a higher rate of infectious complications (sepsis and organ space SSI). For both gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, the robotic platform seems to be protective of aggregate bleeding complications and transfusion requirements, but more so for gastric bypass cases. These findings remained, though less significant, after controlling for operation length and conversion as surrogate variables for surgeon experience. This suggest that the potential benefits of robotic-assisted metabolic and bariatric surgery noted in this study most likely represents an interplay between the surgical platform and surgeon experience.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to our study. First, this study was limited to peri-operative outcomes data only. Stratified outcomes on weight loss, long-term complications, and surgical impact on comorbid conditions could not be assessed. Second, this dataset does not provide relevant surgeon and surgical technique variables that may impact peri-operative outcomes. Surgeon experience or case volume has been shown to have a considerable effect on outcomes [14, 16] and is a variable that is missing from the data set. We attempted to control for this potential confounder by including operative length and conversion rate as matching covariates. There are limitations to using operation length and conversion as surrogate variables for surgeon experience, as there are other patient variables and intra-operative variables that may impact operative length and the likelihood of conversion. A more accurate representation of surgeon experience is needed in the MBSAQIP database to account for this possible confounder. The data also lack information on surgical technique variables between the two cohorts that could have also impacted outcomes. The portion of anastomosis created with a purely hand-sewn, stapled, or a combination of techniques is unknown. With the introduction of the robotic stapler, it is unclear how surgeon\u2019s anastomotic technique on the robotic platform may have changed and impacted outcomes. It is possible that higher rates of organ space SSI and post-operative sepsis seen in SG using the robotic-assisted surgical approach represent surgeon\u2019s early learning curve or changes in technique as technology evolves. There is likely significant intra-operative variation in technique between the two surgical approaches that is not accounted for in the database, and limits a true assessment on outcomes between laparoscopic and robotic-assisted Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. As robotic platforms become more common, it is important to continue to critically assess these surgeon and surgical technique variables and their impact on outcomes. Lastly, even though this is the largest bariatric clinical database available, this is a retrospective analysis and is therefore vulnerable to biases associated with retrospective analysis of clinical databases. While we had a large volume of clinical data to analyze, there were missing data points. Data entry is limited by the timeliness and completeness of data entry by bariatric Clinical Nurse Reviewers. Given the missing data points, this is currently not a 100% capture of relevant clinical data and limits any analysis utilizing this database.",

Both platforms are overall very safe. The robotic-assisted platform is associated with longer operative duration. In spite of the longer operative time, we conclude that the robotic-assisted approach is safe and may provide some advantage for primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, as it is associated with less complication compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach. In contrast, the benefits of robotic-assisted sleeve gastrectomy remain unclear. Our analysis suggest that it is likely less cost-effective due to longer operative duration, post-operative length stay, and 30-days intervention. It may also be less safe due to higher rates of post-operative sepsis and drains present at 30-days, and a tendency toward a higher leak rate. The robotic platform seems to be protective of bleeding complications for both gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, but may mitigate post-operative bleeding complications more in gastric bypass compared to sleeve gastrectomy cases and subsequently impact peri-operative mortality and morbidity. Further studies are warranted to better understand the cost-effectiveness and safety of these surgical platforms, while addressing some of the limitations of this dataset. Surgeons need to remain safety- and cost-conscious when deciding which platform to use in performing primary metabolic and bariatric surgery.",
