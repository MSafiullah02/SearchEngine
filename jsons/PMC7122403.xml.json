There are two types of protein microarrays: antibody microarrays that are used for protein profiling, and functional protein microarrays that contain sets of proteins or, for the case of yeast, nearly an entire yeast proteome. The functional arrays are used for a wide variety of applications and are presented here.",

These include enzymatic assays and interactions with proteins, lipids, small molecules, and nucleic acids (\n3, 8\n). One advantage of protein microarrays is that an entire proteome can be screened in an unbiased fashion, thereby leading to the discovery of novel activities that were not anticipated. For example, screening of a yeast protein chip using biotinylated liposomes revealed many new lipid-binding proteins including enzymes involved in glycolysis (\n3\n), and screening of a yeast proteome chip with yeast DNA revealed a novel metabolic enzyme, Arg5,6, that is associated with DNA and appears to regulate mitochondrial gene expression (\n9\n).",

This study assigned candidate binding proteins for specific sequences, one of which was confirmed. Protein microarrays have also been used to assess antibody specificity (\n11\n) and for identification of autoreactive antibody in patients with diseases such as autoimmune diseases and cancer and thereby find candidate biomarkers and insights into the disease state (\n5\n). Lastly, protein microarrays can be used to identify substrates of modification enzymes such as kinases and ubiquitation enzymes (\n12, 13\n).",

            "text": "Once proteins are prepared they must be printed onto surfaces, typically microscope slides. A variety of different surfaces exist for preparing protein microarrays. They include nitrocellulose and aldehyde surface chemistries for chemical attachment through lysines and affinity attachment methods such as nickel-chelated slides for attaching His tagged proteins and glutathione for affinity attachment (\n15, 3, 16\n). The different surfaces have advantages and disadvantages; nitrocellulose allows the attachment of large amounts of protein, and it along with chemical attachment methods results in random orientation of proteins away from the surface. It is likely that the activity of the attached molecule is lost for many molecules attached by these methods. Moreover, binding of probes to regions near the surface is likely to be sterically inhibited. Affinity attachment methods are more likely to retain activity and orient proteins away from the surface, although random presentation of protein surfaces from the slide is not attained. Different surfaces yield different backgrounds and it is prudent to test several surfaces whenever a new assay is employed.\nConfigure the contact arrayer and align the microscope slides (FAST, Path, or other types of slides see\nNote\n1) to allow the maximum number of slides to be printed per run. This will vary depending on the arrayer used, but for the Bio-Rad ChipWriter Pro it is approximately 90 arrays/run.Maintain a constant humidity of \u223c40% in the printing chamber, and a constant temperature of 4\u00b0C (this is achieved by placing the printer in a temperature-controlled cold room).Remove two plates at a time from the \u221280\u00b0C storage, and allow them to thaw on ice for 5\u201310 min followed by centrifugation at 1,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 2 min.Remove the foil seal from the top of the plate and place the plate into the chamber in the proper orientation for printing (see manufacturer\u2019s instructions).After the print run, cover the plate with a new aluminum seal and return to the \u221280\u00b0C freezer.Repeat for each plate.After printing, store the arrays in a \u221220\u00b0C non-deicing freezer, which can remain stable for up to 1 year.\n",
