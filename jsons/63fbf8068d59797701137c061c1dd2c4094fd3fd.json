The system uses a C 8 column as the stationary phase, and a mixture of acetonitrile, methanol, water and glacial acetic acid as the mobile phase. Good linearity was found in the concentration ranges 1-50 and 0.05-2.50 \u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5g/mL for 1 and 2, respectively. A simple and rapid sample pre-treatment, based on the extraction of the two analytes with a mixture of water and ethanol, was developed for the examination of liquorice confectionery products and root samples. The HPLC method was shown to be appropriate, in terms of precision and feasibility, for the quality control of the analytes in these matrices. a Solvent A, acetonitrile:water:glacial acetic acid (35:64:1, v/v/v); solvent B, methanol.",

The most readily appreciable characteristic of 1 is its sweet taste, from which it derives its name 'Glycyrrhiza' which means 'sweet root' in ancient Greek. In fact, 1 is 170 times sweeter than sucrose (Mizutani et al., 1994) , and this is the basis of its use in the food industry and in pharmaceutical products.",

Glycyrrhizin is one of the leading natural compounds to be taken to clinical trials with regard to chronic active viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. It has been suggested that the demonstrated anti-viral activity of 2 is due to its antioxidant properties (Baltina, 2003; Fujioka et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2003) . Studies have shown that long-term treatment of 1 prevents the development of hepatic carcinoma from C hepatitis (Van Rossum et al., 1998) , and recently it has been found that 1 has in vitro anti-viral activity against SARS-associated coronavirus (Cinatl et al., 2003) . Compound 1 may also be co-administered with pharmaceutical formulations containing oestrogen derivatives to inhibit unwanted effects such as alterations in blood coagulation and thrombosis (Francischetti et al., 1997) ; on the other hand, a 'similoestrogenic' activity of 2 has been demonstrated and its use in the substitutive treatment of menopausal dysfunctions has been proposed (Sharaf et al., 1975) .",

A mixture of acetonitrile, methanol, water and acetic acid (35:35:29:1) was found to be optimal for this purpose. Quantitative analyses were carried at a wavelength of 254 nm, where both analytes showed a relative absorbance maximum, and PAD analysis allowed unambiguous peak identification (by means of on-line spectra) and analysis of peak purity. Indomethacine was selected as internal standard and was also used for retention time control.

The amounts of 1 were very similar for the four different confectionery materials, and were between 4.5 and 5.4% w/w, while 2 was present in only trace levels. Moreover, the amount of 1 in roots was lower than in the confectionery materials. The precision of the method (extraction and chromatography) was then evaluated: intermediate precision values were obtained by repeating the extraction of the same sample (Sirea Oronero chips containing 5.3% of 1 and 0.13% of 2) six times over different days; the RSD% thus calculated was 3.0% for 1 and 3.5% for 2. Accuracy was assessed using powdered commercial product (Sirea Oronero chips) spiked with three different levels of each analyte. Figure 3 shows the chromatogram of the sample to which 10 \u00b5g/mL of 1 and 2 \u00b5g/mL of 2 had been added. The recovery values were between 95 and 102% for 1 and between 99 and 108% for 2, thus indicating the satisfactory accuracy of the method. The proposed HPLC method with UV detection, coupled to a simple and rapid extraction procedure, seems to be suitable, in terms of selectivity and sensitivity, for the analysis of 1 and 2 in liquorice roots and confectionery products. The method also has the advantage of allowing for the simultaneous analysis of 1 and 2 with a single isocratic system. Compared with other methods presented in the literature that employ gradient systems or column switching (Ichikawa et al., 1984; De Groot et al., 1988; Okamura et al., 2001) , the proposed method is simpler and requires less expensive instrumentation. The sensitivity compared with the method of De Groot et al. (1988) is significantly higher and allows the quantivation of traces of 2 in liquorice roots. Moreover, the extraction procedure developed for roots and confectionery products allows for the quantitative extraction of 1 and 2 in a single step. The described HPLC method may also be applicable for the simultaneous determination of 1 and 2 levels in plasma for toxicological and pharmacokinetic studies: further studies are in progress in order to adapt the method to this type of biological matrix.",

For this reason, the same liquorice extracts and confectionery products analysed by the proposed method were analysed using a gradient method. The representative chromatograms of a standard solution containing 1 and 2, and a liquorice root sample are reported in Fig. 4(a and b) , respectively. As can be seen, the gradient method shows greater resolution than the isocratic method but the quantitative results derived from the gradient and the isocratic method were in very good agreement. For this reason, it can be concluded that none of the compounds separated with the former method interfered with 1 or 2 when employing the latter method. Furthermore, the peak purities of 1 and 2 in confectionery materials and root samples, as evaluated by the Chemstation software, were always well within the prescribed limits with both methods.",
