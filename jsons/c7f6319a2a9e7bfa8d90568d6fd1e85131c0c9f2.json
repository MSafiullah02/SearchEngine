At least 11 blood group systems are found in dogs; only one, the dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA)-l system, is polymorphic. Only DEA-7 has a significant frequency of naturally occurring antibody in nonsensitized animals. Efforts are made during blood typing to assure that donor dogs do not have DEA-1 or DEA-7. DEA-1 is immunogenic and frequently can sensitize a recipient lacking that antigen, and DEA-7 is associated with naturally occurring anti-DEA-7 in approximately 50% of animals negative for that antigen. The RBC antigen system in cats is simple, with only A and B antigens defined. It appears these antigens have reciprocal antibodies; that is, cats with type A blood have anti-B antibodies, and those with type B blood have anti-A antibodies.

The effects of this condition depend on the relative contribution of placental transfer of maternal antibody to the neonate vs colostral transfer. Canine and feline placenta types allow limited transplacental immunoglobulin transfer. Equine and bovine placenta types do not allow immunoglobulin transfer from mother to neonate, and patent neonatal immunity depends totally on successful postpartum suckling in these animals. Intestinal absorption of colostral immunoglobulin is most efficient in the first 6 hours postpartum, and is virtually nonexistent after 24 hours. Lack of colostrum appears to have little effect in puppies, and perhaps slight effect in kittens. Its greatest effect is in cattle and horses, and it is extremely difficult to rear these young animals successfully without colostrum.",

The life cycle of this parasite begins with an infected mosquito that passes larvae to a healthy mammal during a bite. The larvae migrate to muscle or fat, and develop into young adult worms within 90 days. The adult migrates to the right ventricle and pulmonary arteries, where it matures within 4 months. In a patent infection, females become gravid by 5 months, and shed microfilaria 6 to 7 months after the initial infection. Canines are the definitive host for D immitis, but felines and other small mammals can become infected. Noncanine hosts generally mount a vigorous immune response to infection, and the development of a patent infection with adult worms is uncommon and often self-limiting.",

The specificity of the heartworm antigen method is good, and a positive result is an excellent predictor of a patent infection with productive female worms. Although the test is marketed for use in canines, clinical experience has demonstrated the antigen test to be useful in felines and other small mammals. However, several factors create a problem with the sensitivity of this assay. The heartworm antigen method can only detect antigen shed from adult female worms. Therefore this method will produce a negative result if the infection is early in development or includes only male worms. Also, if the worm burden is low, the antigen level may not rise above the lower sensitivity limit of this ELISA method. These limiting conditions are commonly present early in canine infection and in infections in noncanine species. Heartworm antibody testing (IFA method) also is available. The antibody assay has a much higher sensitivity than the antigen assay, demonstrating somatic antibodies (against larval antigens) within 1 to 2 weeks of exposure and cuticular antibody (against adult and filarial antigens) within 2 to 3 months. The assay commonly yields.positive results during the prepatent period, in infection with male-only worms, and in infections with low worm burden. The antibody assay is often the assay of choice in noncanine species, because worm burdens are often low or unisex. However, this assay also yields positive results after any exposure to heartworm, even if the exposure fails to develop into an infection. After an exposure or infection has cleared, the antibody assay generally remains positive for 9 to 12 months. This test is also limited by the availability of species-specific fluorescein-conjugated antiglobulin.",
