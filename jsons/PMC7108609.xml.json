The glycosylation of 13 of these sites has been confirmed (Krokhin et al. 2003; Ying et al. 2004; Chakraborti et al. 2005). Receptor binding domains (RBDs) have been identified in the S1 domain of a number of coronaviruses, and a fragment of the SARS-CoV S1 domain, from residues 318\u2013510, binds human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with high affinity (Xiao et al. 2003; Babcock et al. 2004; Wong et al. 2004). It has additionally been demonstrated that ACE2 constitutes an obligate cellular receptor although other receptors may participate in the infection process (Li et al. 2003; Chen and Subbarao 2007). The structure of SARS-CoV RBD complexed with ACE2 revealed that an extended loop of the RBD, comprising residues 424\u2013494, is in direct contact with ACE2 (Li et al. 2005). This receptor binding motif (RBM) is not glycosylated, but it is surrounded by two clusters of glycosylation sites (Han et al. 2007).",

The ABO gene stands out among the genes involved since O blood group individuals were shown to have very low odds of infection compared to non-O individuals in a hospital outbreak that occurred in March 2003 in Hong Kong (Cheng et al. 2005). Histo-blood group antigens are present not only on erythrocytes but also on many epithelial cells, which are their main site of expression (Marionneau et al. 2001). Since SARS-CoV replicates in epithelial cells of the respiratory and digestive tracts that have the ability to synthesize ABH carbohydrate epitopes, we hypothesized that the S protein of virions produced by either A or B individuals could be decorated with A or B carbohydrate epitopes, respectively. Natural anti-A or -B antibodies from blood group O, B, and A individuals could bind to the S protein and block its interaction with ACE2, thereby preventing infection in accordance with the rules of transfusion.",

            "text": "The interaction between the SARS-CoV spike protein and its cellular receptor ACE2 can be studied using a cell-based assay, as described previously (Chou et al. 2005). In this assay, the viral S protein expressed by transfection into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells mediates adhesion to Vero E6 cells that possess ACE2. CHO cells do not express ABH antigens because of the lack of an \u03b11,2-fucosyltransferase activity and of either the A or B histo-blood group enzymes. In order to obtain cells able to express the A antigen, parental CHO cells were stably transfected successively with the rat Fut2 cDNA and a rat A enzyme cDNA. Unlike mock-transfected cells, these double transfectants strongly express cell surface A antigen as detected by flow cytometry. Transfection of the S protein\u2013EGFP fusion construction (S\u2013EGFP) into these cells allowed the expression of the S protein together with the histo-blood group A antigen (Figure 1A). Observation of the triple transfectants by confocal microscopy revealed that, as expected, the A antigen and the S\u2013EGFP fusion protein partially colocalized at the cell surface (Figure 1B). In addition, western blot analysis revealed that among various A antigen positive glycoproteins, a band at the expected size of the S\u2013EGFP fusion protein, between 210\u2014and 230 kDa (Chou et al. 2005), was present in the extract from the triple transfectant Fut2/A/SP but absent from the double Fut2/A transfectant cell extract. It indicated that the S-protein expressed by A-positive CHO cells carried A histo-blood group epitopes. Specificity of the anti-A labeling was ensured since no band was detected in extracts from CHO Fut2 only transfectants (Figure 1C). A stable A antigen and S-EGFP expressing clone showed significantly higher adhesion to Vero cells than either mock transfectants or the A expressing clone devoid of the S protein (Figure 2A and B). Similar results were obtained after transient transfection of the S-EGFP construct (not shown). The presence of the A and/or H antigens on the S protein expressing cells did not affect adhesion since CHO cells only transfected with the S-EGFP construct, as well as CHO cells transfected with both the S-EGFP and Fut2 cDNAs, adhered to Vero cells at a similar level as the A antigen S protein triple transfectants (Figure 2A). In order to control that the cell adhesion was dependent upon the ACE2/S protein interaction, blocking experiments with either an anti-ACE2 or an anti-S protein were performed. Both antibodies significantly inhibited adhesion, although the anti-ACE2 mAb proved more efficient (Figure 2C).",

A clear-cut inhibition of the cell adhesion was observed using the monoclonal antibody 3-3A at 2 \u03bcg/mL. Specificity of the inhibition was confirmed since a control irrelevant antibody failed to inhibit and the adhesion to Vero cells of S protein-transfected CHO cells lacking the A antigen was not inhibited by the anti-A mAb (Figure 2D). Vero cells do not express the A histo-blood group antigen. Therefore, the inhibition of adhesion mediated by the anti-A mAb can only result from a binding to CHO S protein expressing cells and not to the glycans of ACE2. In order to assay the ability of natural human anti-A to inhibit cell adhesion, plasma samples from two O blood group individuals with high anti-A titers were selected. The samples were first adsorbed on silica beads conjugated to the A type 2 tetrasaccharide in order to specifically remove the anti-A natural plasma antibodies. Efficacy of the adsorption was controlled by ELISA which showed that the reactivity to the A type 2 tetrasaccharide was almost completely abolished following adsorption (Figure 3B). The A type 2 adsorbed and mock adsorbed plasma samples from the two individuals were then added in the cell-based assay. Both mock adsorbed samples, containing the anti-A as shown in Figure 3B, strongly inhibited the adhesion of A antigen-S protein expressing cells to Vero cells. In both cases, this inhibition was almost completely lost after A type 2 adsorption, showing that it was specifically mediated by anti-A plasma antibodies (Figure 3C). Moreover, the inhibition of adhesion by blood group O plasma was dose-dependent and still detected at a plasma dilution as low as 1/32 (Figure 3D).",

A strong or moderate group effect denotes a strong or moderate protection, respectively, whereas no group effect corresponds to an absence of protection. The impact of group effect was assessed on the number of infected individuals over time in four different populations with very different frequencies of ABO phenotypes (Figure 5). A strong group effect delayed the initiation of the epidemic as well as it decreased importantly the total number of infected individuals whatever the population considered as compared to no group effect and, to a lesser extent, a moderate group effect. Moreover, a strong group effect evidenced different starting times of the epidemic according to the different populations (Figure 5B). The impact of group effect was assessed on the number of infected individuals over time according to their blood groups in the Chinese (Hong Kong) population (Figure 6). The number of blood group O-infected individuals was always the most important one, closely followed by blood group B-, A-, and AB-infected individuals whatever the transmission pattern considered. A strong group effect also delayed the initiation of the epidemic as well as it markedly decreased the total number of infected individuals. Furthermore, a strong group effect also postponed the starting time of the epidemic in blood group O individuals as compared with the other blood groups. The blood group type of the index case in the Hong Kong outbreak was not provided (Cheng et al. 2005). The modeling was first performed using a blood group O index case, as described above. In order to assess whether the results could be affected by the blood group type of this first case, further simulations were performed with different index cases of either the A, B, or AB blood group. The main results were not modified since a strong group effect always delayed the initiation of the epidemic as compared to no group effect and to a moderate group effect. Likewise, it markedly decreased the total number of infected individuals irrespective of the index case's blood group (data not shown).",

            "text": "Probably due to mimicry of A or B antigens by flora or infectious bacteria, individuals acquire anti-A or -B blood group antibodies to the antigen that they do not synthesize. These so-called natural anti-histo-blood group antibodies have long been suspected to play a role in anti-viral immunity since viruses may carry ABH structures as terminal carbohydrate motifs of their envelope glycoproteins or possibly as inserted glycolipids (Greenwell 1997). In line with this concept, a monoclonal anti-A was shown to neutralize HIV produced by lymphocytes from blood group A donors only (Arendrup et al. 1991). More recently, anti-A or -B from human serum were shown to sensitize HIV to complement-mediated inactivation (Neil et al. 2005). Likewise, measles virus produced by cells expressing either A or B histo-blood group epitopes was neutralized by natural anti-HBGAs in a complement-dependent manner (Preece et al. 2002). Though these in vitro data suggest that natural anti-HBGAs may provide protection against some viruses, they have not been substantiated by epidemiological observations so far. If natural anti-A or -B serum antibodies provide protection, it is expected that during an outbreak, blood group O individuals should experience a lower risk of infection than non-blood group O individuals. This has not been observed for either HIV or measles virus at present. Yet, it is precisely what was observed in the case of a hospital outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, where O blood group individuals appeared at a much lower risk of being infected by SARS-CoV than subjects of other blood types (Cheng et al. 2005). Interestingly, SARS-CoV infects cells that express ABH antigens according to the individual's ABO phenotype. Indeed, SARS-CoV infection has been documented in pneumocytes, enterocytes of the small intestine as well as in cells of the kidney distal tubular epithelium, all cell types known to be able to synthesize ABH antigens (Chen and Subbarao 2007; Gu and Korteweg 2007). Since the glycosylation of viral glycoproteins necessitates the glycosylation machinery of the infected cell, viral particles synthesized in cells that may express that histo-blood group antigens are expected to be tagged with these antigenic motifs, and therefore natural antibodies directed against these carbohydrate tags may have a protective role (Seymour et al. 2004).",

This has already been observed with mannose-specific lectins which have shown anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV by blocking virus attachment to its receptor (Keyaerts et al. 2007). Our data indicate that natural anticarbohydrate antibodies could have a similar effect. In addition to the blocking of virus attachment to its receptor, natural antibodies could block entry or opsonize viral particles leading to complement-mediated neutralization (Neil et al. 2005). Moreover, it was recently shown that natural antibodies can contribute to help the generation of cytotoxic T cells against the pathogen (St\u00e4ger et al. 2003; D\u00fcrrbach et al. 2007).

            "text": "Since the epidemiology of SARS has been well documented (Anderson et al. 2004; He and Chinese 2004), it was possible to develop a model of the virus transmission that takes into account the effect of the ABO polymorphism. Critical transmission parameters were deduced from those of the global SARS outbreak and from those of the Hong Kong hospital outbreak where the ABO effect was observed. The model considers that no prophylatic measures were taken; although this is clearly unrealistic, it allows us to fully appreciate the impact of the blood group polymorphism itself. Of note, the expression of ABH antigens in epithelial cells where SARS-CoV replicates is also controlled by polymorphisms of the FUT2 gene. Thus, individuals with two FUT2 null alleles, the so-called nonsecretors, are unable to synthesize H antigen and hence A or B antigens in these cells (Marionneau et al. 2001). For simplicity, the model did not consider such individuals since with regard to the virus transmission, they would behave as O blood group donors. Including them in the analysis is therefore similar to slightly increase the pool of O individuals. Since anti-A and anti-B titer interindividual variability is quite high, and since we observed that plasmas from O blood group individuals with low anti-A titers were not inhibitory in the cell adhesion assay (not shown), we considered transmission parameters allowing for a moderate ABO effect only. In this case, virus transmission in incompatible ABO situations remains possible but with a lower probability of occurrence than in compatible situations. That is certainly more realistic than the case of the strong ABO effect where ABO incompatibility completely impairs virus transmission. The latter case was analyzed in order to evaluate the maximal potential of the ABO polymorphism. The model indicated that both in the presence of a moderate or a strong group effect, virus transmission was decreased, supporting the hypothesis that natural anti-A and -B antibodies can contribute to protect against selected viral diseases at the population level. Less intuitively, the model shows that the main effect of the natural anti-histo-blood group antibodies is to delay and slow down the epidemic. In the case of a full protection (strong effect), the delay between the occurrence of the first cases and the full development of the outbreak can be very large. It is linked to the frequency of O individuals in the population, but remains very significant even in a population with an unusually low blood group O frequency such as the A\u00efnous of Japan. This delay, already clearly visible when taking into account a moderate ABO effect only, might have had an adaptative value, in past epidemics of other viruses with transmission characteristics similar to those of SARS, since it allows for modifications of behavior limiting the spread of epidemics. This could have contributed to the maintenance of the ABO polymorphism throughout human evolution and history. Mean natural anti-A or -B titers tend to decrease over the years in developed countries, possibly due to improved hygiene (Dr. A. Blancher, personal communication). It is thus possible that in the past their protective effect was higher than in most contemporary populations. It could thus be of interest to raise the levels of anti-A or -B in all populations so as to slow and limit the spread of some emergent pathogens. This could prove a valuable prevention strategy against SARS but also against other coronaviruses which are responsible for a significant proportion of common colds and can contribute to more severe respiratory tract infections (van der Hoek 2005).",
