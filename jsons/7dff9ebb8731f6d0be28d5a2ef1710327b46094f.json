            "text": "In this paper we study the problem of clustering bacterial isolates into epidemiologically related groups from next-generation sequencing data. Existing methods for this problem mainly use a single genotyping signal, and either use a distance-based method with a pre-specified number of clusters, or a phylogenetic tree-based method with a prespecified threshold. We propose PathOGiST, an algorithmic framework for clustering bacterial isolates by leveraging multiple genotypic signals and calibrated thresholds. PathOGiST uses different genotypic signals, clusters the isolates based on these individual signals with correlation clustering, and combines the clusterings based on the individual signals through consensus clustering. We implemented and tested PathOGiST on three different bacterial pathogens -Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis -and we conclude by discussing further avenues to explore.",

Specifically, such a partitioning, which we will refer to as a clustering, can provide information on particularly transmissible strains (super-spreaders) and identify where an intervention such as active case finding may be particularly beneficial. In combination with additional metadata, such as geography or time of observation, such a clustering can also help identify rapidly growing groups (transmission hotspots), narrow down the potential origins of an outbreak (index case), and distinguish between recent and historical transmissions.",

Historically, fairly coarse genotypes such as VNTR (variable-number of tandem repeats, i.e. the number of copies of a set of pre-specified repeated regions in a strain) [29] , PFGE (pulsed field gel electrophoresis) [15] and MLST (multi-locus sequence type, i.e. the alleles at a small number of pre-specified housekeeping genes) [18] have been the predominant mode of genotyping bacterial pathogens. These lowresolution signals, which we refer to as \"fingerprints\", could lead to incorrectly clustered strains [1] since unrelated bacterial isolates may happen to share identical fingerprints. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) [17] , new genotypic signals have become available. These include SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) profiles [6] , which can be identified at the whole-genome scale, and also wgMLST (whole-genome multi-locus sequence type) [19] , which contains the alleles at all of the known genes in the organism of interest.",

Alternatively, such methods may simply apply a standard clustering method, such as hierarchical clustering, to the pairwise distance matrix; in this case, the number of clusters is typically specified in advance [5] . Other methods -which tend to be more computationally expensiveleverage a phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the data to define clusters [2, 11] .

However, in this paper we argue for the principled combination of both low-resolution as well as high-resolution genotypic signals. The framework we propose here, called PathOGiST, innovates in several key ways. First, it leverages multiple genotypic signals extracted from NGS data. They can be further subdivided according to granularity into coarse and fine signals; the former get penalized only for grouping together isolates with different genotypes, not for splitting isolates with similar genotypes, while the latter get penalized for both of these. Second, it is based on a distance threshold, but does not apply a transitive closure operator to the similarity graph, or require a pre-specified number of clusters. Instead, it makes use of the correlation clustering paradigm, which tries to minimize the number of pairs of distant isolates within clusters while minimizing the number of pairs of close isolates between clusters. Third, it can be calibrated to different bacterial pathogens and genotyping signals, although we also provide an automatic threshold detector based on the distribution of pairwise distances between isolates.",

We first compute a clustering of the isolates for each distance matrix, and then compute a consensus of these separate clusterings. For the first step, we rely on correlation clustering [3] , which we describe in Sect. 2.1. For the second step, we use a modified approach to the consensus clustering problem [4] , also based on a correlation clustering formulation, described in Sect. 2.2.

On the other hand, the C4 heusritic is significantly faster and requires much less memory even on the larger datasets, as shown in Table 2 . However, it is not deterministic, and random restarts may give slightly different, incompatible results. To evaluate the C4 heuristic performance, we compared the objective values of solutions found by C4 and by the exact ILP.

After we inferred phylogenetic trees, we ran Phydelity and TreeCluster with their default settings. In order to pick a single threshold for each genotyping signal-pathogen combination in PathOGiST, we chose the threshold resulting in the best ARI (CP for M. tuberculosis) among all the options. These thresholds are set as the default thresholds for these genotyping signal-pathogen combinations, but can be overridden by the user. Table 5 (Appendix) shows the chosen optimal threshold for each dataset and genotyping signal. Having clustering outputs of the single signal correlation clustering algorithm with chosen default thresholds, we ran consensus clustering for each pathogen with all their available genotyping signals. We considered SNP clustering as the finest because it provides a higher resolution signal comparing to other genotyping signals. The results are described in Table 3 . The main observation is that in all cases, but M. tuberculosis, the consensus clustering ARI is close to the best ARI obtained by a single genotyping signal, showing that our approach indeed removes the need to chose a single signal for clustering.",
