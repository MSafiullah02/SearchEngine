            "text": "SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002\u20132003 and presented primarily as a fulminant atypical pneumonia with a case fatality rate of about 10%. Since its disappearance at the end of the 2003 pandemic, the virus and the associated syndrome have been the focus of intense study. Pathologic studies on the lungs of fatal cases often report the presence of marked diffuse alveolar damage and uniformly report SARS-CoV antigen and/or RNA in the alveolar epithelium and alveolar macrophages (CD68+ cells) (Ding et al., 2004, Franks et al., 2003, Gu et al., 2005, He et al., 2006, Hwang et al., 2005, Nicholls et al., 2006, Shieh et al., 2005, To et al., 2004, Ye et al., 2007). These studies indicate that alveolar epithelial cells are important cells involved with SARS infection and subsequent diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure. When the alveolar epithelium is further differentiated into type I and type II cells, the various studies report infection of one, the other, or both cell types. The primary receptor of SARS-CoV was identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003). ACE2 is distributed among numerous tissues, including abundant expression on the pulmonary and intestinal epithelia accounting for the pulmonary and GI symptoms observed with infection (Hamming et al., 2004, He et al., 2006).",

Type I cells are thin, flat cells that cover over 90% of the alveolar surface and comprise 8% of total lung cells (Stone et al., 1992a). The primary function of the type I cells is to facilitate gas exchange between the lumen of the alveoli and the blood. Alveolar type II cells are cuboidal epithelial cells that comprise 15% of total lung cells and maintain the alveolar microenvironment through production and secretion of pulmonary surfactant, transepithelial sodium transport and alveolar fluid homeostasis, proliferation to maintain the epithelium, and ultimate transdifferentiation into type I cells (Mason, 2006). The alveolar wall and air space also contains alveolar macrophages and other inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts as well as cells within the microvasculature. All of the cells could be theoretic targets for SARS-CoV infections, but ACE2 has been reported to be heavily expressed on alveolar type II cells in the human lung (Ding et al., 2004, Hamming et al., 2004, He et al., 2006).",

A549 cells, a lung carcinoma cell line that has been used as a model of alveolar epithelial cells although it does not express the surfactant proteins, has been refractory to SARS-CoV infection unless provided with exogenous ACE2 despite expressing some endogenous ACE2 (Gillim-Ross et al., 2004, Hamming et al., 2004, Lieber et al., 1976, Mossel et al., 2005). Calu-3 cells, a bronchial epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line, are permissive to SARS-infection and are a useful model for infection (Ren et al., 2006, Tseng et al., 2005). Two groups have reported that differentiated airway ciliated cells can be infected with SARS-CoV and that the infection correlated with ACE2 expression (Jia et al., 2005, Sims et al., 2005). However, infection of primary cultures of alveolar epithelial cells has not been reported.",

As shown in Fig. 1\n, these cells express SP-A and proSP-C as well as fatty acid synthase (FAS) and ACE2 when cultured with keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), 8-Br-cAMP (A), and dexamethasone (Dex, D) collectively referred to as KAID, in the presence of 1% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (CS-FBS). By both Western and RNA analyses, ACE2 expression was highest in the presence of KAID in 1% CS-FBS (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The type I-like cells expressed caveolin-1, receptor for advanced glycated end products (RAGE), and cytokeratin, but expression of ACE2, SP-A, SP-B, and proSP-C was below the limit of detection (Fig. 1 and data not shown) (Wang et al., 2007).",

The small, cuboidal cells stained positive for SP-A, cytokeratin, EP-CAM, and a type II cell-specific antibody obtained from Dr. Leland Dobbs, University of California, San Francisco (Fang et al., 2006) (Figs. 4A\u2013L), and proSP-C (data not shown) confirming their type II phenotype.

Second, pathological specimens have the advantage of examining primary cells in their natural context, but by necessity have focused on the more severe or fatal cases, in which there is excessive tissue injury and cell recognition is difficult. It is not known if the diffuse alveolar damage is due primarily to alveolar epithelial infection, a cytokine storm, or a combination of these and other host factors, and if any special cell\u2013cell interactions or protease exposure is required for alveolar epithelial infections.

            "text": "In this report, we describe a model for the study of SARS-CoV infection of primary human alveolar epithelial cells. In our culture system, type II alveolar epithelial cells from all nine donors supported SARS-CoV replication. Immunofluorescent analysis suggests that viral replication occurs in a limited number of cells within our cultures. Replication of SARS-CoV did not, however, occur in the type I-like cells from any of the six donors examined. However, it should be noted that while these type I-like cells express many of the markers of type I cells in vivo, they were derived from type II cells in vitro and may not express all of the surface proteins of type I cells in the lung. We also observed the occasional infection of pulmonary fibroblasts, which was variable in different cultures. The number of contaminating fibroblasts varied with the donor and cell isolate. Because infected type II cells and fibroblasts were observed within the same cultures, it is not clear whether one or both of the infections is productive. Cultured monocyte derived macrophages are not susceptible to SARS-CoV infection as determined by virus production (Cheung et al., 2005). We extended this observation to human alveolar macrophages in primary culture. These results contrast with the several pathological studies that describe widespread detection of SARS-CoV RNA and/or antigen in the alveolar epithelium, both in type II and type I cells, though not always both cell types in every study (Ding et al., 2004, Franks et al., 2003, Gu et al., 2005, He et al., 2006, Hwang et al., 2005, Lang et al., 2003, Nicholls et al., 2006, Shieh et al., 2005, To et al., 2004, Ye et al., 2007). In addition, in these pathologic studies, alveolar macrophages were shown to be positive for SARS-CoV antigen and/or RNA. Giant multi-nucleated cells or syncytia within the lungs are characteristic of fatal SARS-CoV infection, though these do not always represent infected cells (Ding et al., 2003, Gu et al., 2005, Hwang et al., 2005, Nicholls et al., 2006, To et al., 2004). The SARS-CoV positive multinucleated giant cells can be derived from epithelial cells (cytokeratin positive) or macrophages (CD-68 positive) (Franks et al., 2003, Nicholls et al., 2003).",

However, with our antibodies and immunofluorescent techniques the level of expression of ACE2 is below the limit of detection in most cells in our cultures. ACE2 expression in type II cell cultures was increased by the addition of IL-13 to the basal medium but not to KAID medium in 1%CS-FBS, and the addition of IL-13 did not result in increased infection efficiency (data not shown). Additionally, as Figs. 4M\u2013O demonstrates, numerous cells can be identified that express ACE2 but do not appear to be infected with SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "It is possible that other factors contributed to the inefficiency of SARS-CoV infection. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) might aggregate the virus and inhibit infection. SP-A and SP-D are secreted by type II cells and have a variety of immunoregulatory functions. Recently SP-D has been reported to bind to the spike glycoprotein on SARS-CoV (Leth-Larsen et al., 2007), and this could possibly limit infection. Type II cells also produce numerous cytokines that may have an effect on permissiveness to SARS-CoV infection. Beta-defensin-2 is a protein produced by type II cells shown in some cases to have direct anti-viral activity (Ganz, 2002, Sun et al., 2005). Efforts were made to remove surfactant proteins and other soluble factors from the cultures at the time of infection, but none resulted in increased infection efficiency. There also may be co-stimulating molecules for receptor binding or cathepsins needed for maximal viral infection that are missing from these primary cultures (Huang et al., 2006). Therefore, ACE2 expression alone may not account for the scarcity of infected cells. Another difference between the in vitro situation and the in vivo situation is the low volume of apical fluid such that a very high MOI likely exits in vivo. The alveolar fluid volume in an adult human is thought to be only 35 mL spread over a surface area of about 100 m2 (Stone et al., 1992b).",

In addition, Lang et al. reported SARS RNA in interstitial cells as well as type II cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells (Lang et al., 2003). However, previous data indicated that fibroblast cell lines (MRC-5, HEL) were not permissive to SARS-CoV infection (Gillim-Ross et al., 2004, Kaye, 2006, Mossel et al., 2005). The infection of fibroblasts may have been related to particular characteristics of our cultures. The infection only occurred in one of five low passage cultures of primary lung fibroblasts. The infection that occurred in the one permissive sample was much more apparent in 1% CS-FBS plus KAID than in media with 5% FBS. The cells in our primary cultures of alveolar epithelial cells were considered fibroblasts because they expressed vimentin and collagen III but not CD31 or CD45. It is possible that these particular fibroblasts were derived from epithelial cells by epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), but we believe this possibility is unlikely. EMT in vitro requires exogenous transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), which was not added to these cultures (Willis et al., 2005, Yao et al., 2004).",
