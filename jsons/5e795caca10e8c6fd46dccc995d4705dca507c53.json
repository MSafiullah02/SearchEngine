To achieve this, several key infrastructures need to be in place, including (1) the ability to perform daily massive amounts of tests, (2) a person-centric end-to-end protocol for isolating infected or vulnerable individuals, (3) special measures for individuals in high-risk, high-spread professions, such as healthcare personnel and nursing home workers; and (4) the ability to give tests to the right people to quickly identify new sources of infection.",

Unfortunately, most of these proposals -and even the most privacy-preserving ones, such as the SafePaths project at MIT 1 and the PEPP-PT project in Europe 2 -have several limitations, including:",

In a domestic violence or divorce situation, could someone deliberately misreport, or threaten to misreport, an infection on their partner's phone? Once this app is present on everyone's phone, will governments be tempted to use contact tracing for other purposes?

Accuracy is especially important in apartment buildings where many people are close by measured distance, but not necessarily sharing the same physical space. The result of these inaccuracies could generate a very large set of people to test, creating an immense demand for testing with many false positives.",

This voucher is not connected to the identity of Person X. 2. Person X is told that they can share this code with up to 6 people, which is an upper bound of the estimated reproductive number for COVID-19 11 . This number would be adjusted based on the findings of an initial pilot. Person X would be asked to distribute these vouchers to the people they think they might have infected. 3. The recipients of the code can use it to book an appointment for receiving a COVID-19 test at a web site provided by the government or by a private testing facility. The web site does not require the recipient to identify themselves; it only validates that the code has not been used more than 6 times and gives a confirmation code with a testing location and a date/time. 4. The recipient goes to the testing facility, presents the confirmation code and is given the test. The next day, the recipient can check the results of their test either e.g. online or by phone using only their confirmation code (which would be fully anonymous). Recipients that test positive would again receive a voucher that would allow them to follow the same process as above.",
