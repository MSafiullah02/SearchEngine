Although this prevalence has limited generalizability to geographic regions with lower rates of infection, it underscores the risk of Covid-19 among asymptomatic obstetrical patients. Moreover, the true prevalence of infection may be underreported because of false negative results of tests to detect SARS-CoV-2. 3 The potential benefits of a universal testing approach include the ability to use Covid-19 status to determine hospital isolation practices and ",
