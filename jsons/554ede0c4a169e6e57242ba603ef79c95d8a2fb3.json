We specifically focus on livestock production and regulation. We develop a simple economic framework to demonstrate the effect of location on intensification of industrial activity in farming, and discuss this issue in the context of urbanization and economic growth in developing countries. Policy implications of the model are discussed in light of the experience of developed countries in regulating livestock pollution and other externalities. We argue that environmental problems from agricultural industrialization in developing countries may pose major challenges. In the case of livestock production, these are compounded by production intensity, high population densities in periurban and urban areas, and the generally lower public health standards. As the recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza epidemics in Asia suggest, the new era of globalization and the onset of a free world trade regime points to the urgent need for developing countries to install inspection and enforcement mechanisms that ensure product safety and quality, as well as minimize the adverse effects on the environment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "It is universally known to observers of agricultural development that the structure of agriculture is rapidly changing both in developed and developing countries.

These changes have not only affected the way business has been traditionally conducted on the farm, but are the cause of major environmental and public health impacts that have local and global consequences. The recent outbreaks of SARS and avian influenza in Asia and their worldwide impacts are examples of the global repercussions of local health and environmental problems.

There is a dearth of studies that examine the scope and extent of industrialization, and its effects on the environmental and natural resource base. In particular, because the industrialization of agriculture is taking place mainly in the developing countries, there is also very little systematic empirical evidence available. The past preoccupation with the \"green revolution\" has tended to obfuscate the growing seriousness of the problems generated by the \"livestock revolution.\" Most available information is based on anecdotal evidence and isolated case studies.

Section 2 overviews the nature and extent of agroindustrialization and its effect on the environment. Section 3 highlights the current state of intensive livestock production in the Asia-Pacific region, with a particular focus on beef and dairy cattle. Section 4 develops a theoretical model that explains intensification of input use in urban and periurban areas as well as allocation of land to alternative uses. Section 5 focuses on the environmental externalities from agroindustrialization. Specifically, the regulatory experience in the USA is discussed in light of conditions in the developing countries in Sect. 6. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes the article by outlining possible directions for policy reform in developing countries.

One of the most important aspects of agroindustrialization, often called the \"livestock revolution,\" is the growth of meat and milk production relative to cereal. In the period between 1965 and 2000, consumption of meat in developing countries grew by 105 million metric tons (427%), while consumption in developed countries increased by 43 million tons (88%) (see Table 1 ). In 2000, per capita meat consumption in developed and developing countries was 77.2 and 27.6 kg/year, respectively. On the other hand, per capita consumption of milk and milk products in developed countries was 196.5 kg/year, while that in developing countries was only 45.4 kg/year (see Table 2 ). Given that meat and milk consumption levels in the developed countries are currently several times higher than in developing countries, and that there is likely to be an inevitable convergence in the standards of living and dietary patterns between these two groups of countries, these differential growth rates have given rise to a major increase in livestock production in the developing countries (Delgado et al. 1998) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 785, "end": 800, "text": "Hamilton (1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1160, "text": "Region 1965", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1172, "text": "Region 1975", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1184, "text": "Region 1985", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1196, "text": "Region 1995", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1208, "text": "Region 2000", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1209, "end": 1220, "text": "Region 1965", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1232, "text": "Region 1975", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1244, "text": "Region 1985", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1256, "text": "Region 1995", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1306, "text": "1965 1975 1985 1995 2000 1965 1975 1985 1995 2000", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1319, "text": "FAOSTAT 1997", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1334, "text": "FAOSTAT , 2006", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2547, "text": "(Delgado et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1029, "end": 1036, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1816, "end": 1823, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2122, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This increase in demand for livestock products necessitates a change in the structure of livestock production from being dependent on surplus resources such as underutilized lands, pastures, and grasses with low opportunity costs in alternative uses, to an intensive use of limited resources such as land and vegetation.

The recent epidemic of SARS is attributed to livestock cultivation in high-density population centers in China. The Food and Agriculture Organization (F AO) predicts that \"structural change in food consumption patterns in the developing countries towards more livestock products will continue with significant increases in per capita consumption of meat in all regions except South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, their per capita consumption of such products will still be below those of the highincome countries in 2010\" (F AO 1995) . The two exceptions are South Asia, mainly because of cultural restrictions on meat consumption; and Sub-Saharan Africa, due to economic stagnation and the lack of demand growth.

For example, beef is mainly consumed in Japan and Australia, while pork is the main meat consumed in East Asia, and poultry in the developed countries in the region (see Table 4 ). On the other hand, milk is largely consumed in the developed countries of Asia and in South Asia (see Table 5 ). Annual growth rates for per capita consumption of nearly all livestock products are in the range of 3%-4%. Most animal production in Asia still takes place in grazing and pastoral systems (cattle, sheep, and goats) and in mixed, rain-fed, and irrigated farming systems that integrate crop and livestock production (Steinfeld 1998) . However, industrial production systems, which were almost nonexistent until recently, contribute a small but increasing share of production. Table 5 shows the per capita meat and milk consumption in Asia during 1965-2005. During this period, India increased its consumption of milk and milk products by more than 96%. Moreover, per capita meat consumption in China rose by over 450%. Livestock demand in the region is increasing because of several factors including population, income growth, and urbanization. Asia's population is growing at about 1.7% annually with 2.1 % in South Asia and only about 0.6% in the developed countries of the region. The formation of free trade zones under the Uruguay Round and economic integration within the newly industrializing economies has created opportunities for trade in livestock products. Investments have been made throughout Asia in processing facilities and the transportation of livestock products, especially close to urban areas. This process is in no way complete, and continued increases in supply will create severe pressures on the Asian environment (Steinfeld 1998) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 189, "end": 209, "text": "(Fisher et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 452, "end": 501, "text": "1965 1975 1985 1995 2000 1965 1975 1985 1995 2000", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 502, "end": 514, "text": "FAOSTAT 1997", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 515, "end": 529, "text": "FAOSTAT , 2006", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1211, "text": "(Steinfeld 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2320, "end": 2336, "text": "(Steinfeld 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 327, "end": 334, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 757, "end": 764, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 870, "end": 877, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1362, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Production and consumption in the Asia-Pacific region"}, {"text": "Steinfeld argues that the role of livestock in the continent is changing away from the asset, petty cash, and insurance functions that are being performed by emerging financial institutions in rural areas, while government subsidies are promoting mechanization at the expense of draught animal power.

Livestock production is changing as the value of marginal product of labor declines in traditional systems, leading to the migration of labor to the commercial sector. This has resulted in the substitution of capital for labor as well as a structural reorganization of industry. For example, poultry production often changes from a simple farm operation to a complex vertical operation including grain production for animal feeds, feed mills, slaughterhouses and processing plants, food chain stores, and wholesale enterprises (Chantalakhana 1996) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 59, "end": 69, "text": "(FAO 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 788, "end": 808, "text": "(Chantalakhana 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Production and consumption in the Asia-Pacific region"}, {"text": "The encroachment of cropland into traditional pasture lands is another important factor that has contributed to this shift. This results in the use of marginal lands in grazing, thereby causing declining productivity, in turn triggering a shift of resources from traditional to more efficient industrial systems of production. The developing countries of Asia often run a trade deficit in ruminant meat but a surplus in monogastric meat (Fisher et al. 2004 ). While the region as a whole is self-sufficient, Australia and New Zealand make up the deficit, especially in beef and milk. Other countries are expected to face large deficits in livestock products, such as Indonesia in red meat and Taiwan, which imports 95% of its concentrate feed. Steinfeld (1998) contends that although both modern and traditional systems coexist, it is essentially a disequilibrium situation, with resources continuing to flow from the low-productivity, low-input traditional grazing system to the modern capital-intensive livestock industry. However, the traditional system may still thrive in regions with low population densities, such as in some areas of the Philippines, Indonesia, and China. This trend will be strengthened if government policies are developed to strengthen traditional institutions and increase local access to common resources. Otherwise, any intensification of this system will result in the degradation of the natural resource base. Mixed farming systems such as those prevalent in the Himalayan hills are in danger from growing populations, fragmentation of arable land, poverty, and lack of easy market access. On the other hand, substitution into the intensive model of production in peri-urban areas is fraught with major environmental risks.

For simplicity, let the opportunity cost of land be given by the rent-distance function in dairying, denoted by Rix), which we assume does not create significant externalities relative to pig and poultry production. Let the externality damage be the cost t per unit input use q. This is the environmental cost per unit input use and does not vary across locations. For example, this may be the cost of cleaning up the waste produced per head of livestock used on the farm. The agricultural firm's maximization problem then becomes: where RL(X) and Rix) are the rent-distance functions from pig and poultry production (now with the negative externality) and from dairying, respectively, and X denotes the boundary of the pig and poultry production system. The firstorder condition shows that the value of marginal product from livestock production is now equated to the cost of input plus the cost of the environmental externality. Because the social cost of livestock farming increases with the externality, land rents decline and thus, the negative environmental externality from pig and poultry production leads to a new switch point from pig to dairy production shown by X', which is closer to the city center (Fig. 2) . The function R f denotes rents from land use in forestry. In a market equilibrium where the externality is not regulated, we will have too much land under livestock production with a negative externality and too little in alternative uses. Moreover, there will be higher than optimal input use at each location and too much pig and poultry production. Note that if the rents from forestry are lower than in these alternative land uses, no land will be under forestry, as can be seen by shifting the forestry rent-distance function down in Fig. 2 . Although he does not employ a formal model, Upton (1997) uses this framework to disaggregate livestock production into (1) pigs and poultry, (2) dairying, and (3) ruminant meat production using grazing as the primary feed source (see Fig. 2 ). He concludes that rents per acre are highest for pigs and poultry. Dairying yields lower rents per hectare because of relatively high transport costs. The yield from range lands are the lowest of the three. Productivity may change over time, because of a shift in the value of model parameters. For example, a relatively high rate of productivity growth in industrial livestock systems relative to ruminant production will increase intensity as well as the area under pig and poultry production.
