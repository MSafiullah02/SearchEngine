It continues for a short distance cranially before passing dorsocaudally and to the left by forming a U-bend, the aortic arch. Two great vessels leave the aortic arch to supply the head, neck, and thoracic limbs: the brachiocephalic trunk and the left subclavian artery. The ligamentum arteriosum, the connective tissue remnant of the fetal ductus arteriosus, arises near the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk and passes to the aorta.

The right and left phrenic nerves run across the dorsal third of the pericardium and must be identified and preserved during pericardectomy. Paired pericardiophrenic blood vessels from the internal thoracic arteries run with the phrenic nerves. Pericardial blood vessels, also arising from the internal thoracic arteries, run within the pericardium passing in a caudoventral direction.

Left ventricular systolic function may become impaired. If a left-to-right shunting PDA is identified, Doppler studies can be performed and will show characteristic high velocity turbulent flow from the aorta, through the ductus and into the main pulmonary artery (Fig. 48-3\n). This PDA peak velocity will decrease if pulmonary pressures increase, prior to exceeding systemic pressures. However, note that this decrease may be reactive pulmonary hypertension as a consequence of the pulmonary over-circulation and closure of the PDA may resolve the mild pulmonary hypertension when assessed after surgery. Mild increase of velocity in the left ventricular outflow tract and mild aortic and pulmonic insufficiency may also be recognized. Mitral regurgitation is secondary to the left-sided dilation and may be significant.",

Clinically significant PE is very uncommon in cats, and this species rarely presents with cardiac tamponade. In both species PEs remain asymptomatic if the effusion is small and the pericardium remains slightly compliant, or if a larger effusion accumulates slowly allowing the pericardial sac to accommodate to some extent. Cardiac tamponade results when the amount of fluid (or cyst/mass) reaches a volume such that it exerts a pressure equal to or greater than normal cardiac diastolic pressures. The heart is compressed externally and cannot fill effectively during diastole. Right ventricular filling is reduced first, and may progress to compromise left ventricular filling and cardiac output. Systemic venous pressure and capillary hydrostatic pressure increase whilst cardiac output is reduced.

Cats with significant PE may benefit from subtotal pericardectomy (see Box 48-4).Box 48-2PericardiocentesisPericardiocentesis is performed in the conscious cat if this is tolerated, otherwise sedation is used if required for patient restraint. The cat may be positioned in lateral or sternal recumbency, depending on clinician preference and the tolerance of the patient. Pericardiocentesis can be performed through a right or left lateral approach. ECG monitoring should be performed throughout the procedure. The landmark for pericardiocentesis is found by palpation of the point of maximal intensity of the heart beat; this is typically the ventral 6th-7th intercostal space and is confirmed using ultrasonography. The area is clipped and prepared for surgery and local anesthetic can be instilled into the skin, subcutaneous tissues, intercostal muscles, and pleura at the site of proposed catheter entry through the chest wall. Pericardiocentesis is performed as a sterile procedure using aseptic technique. A tiny stab incision is made in the skin at the point of catheter insertion and a 16\u201318G 2.5 inch over the needle catheter is introduced through the chest wall in a direction aimed towards the opposite scapula. Extra holes can be cut in the catheter near the tip to increase the efficiency of drainage. The catheter is slowly introduced through the chest wall and through the pericardium. If the tip of the catheter can be felt touching the surface of the heart and/or the patient develops arrhythmias, the catheter should be withdrawn several millimeters before being redirected. Once sanguinous fluid is seen in the hub of the catheter, or the catheter is identified within the pericardial sac if performing the entire procedure under ultrasonographic guidance, the needle is removed and the catheter is connected to a piece of extension tubing and a 20\u201350 mL syringe. The catheter is advanced several more millimeters into the pericardial sac and fluid is aspirated. To confirm that the fluid is not being withdrawn from a blood vessel or the heart, the fluid can be observed for one to two minutes for the presence of clotting. PE will not clot, whilst blood collected from the heart or a blood vessel will clot. Once the catheter is within the pericardial sac the pericardial fluid is drained. Ultrasonography should be performed to confirm removal of the effusion. At the completion of pericardiocentesis the catheter can be withdrawn.",

In these circumstances the pericardium is subject to the same environment and is also likely to become thickened and less compliant and there may be a consequential increase in venous pressures. Even a modest increase could cause the formation of extra lymphatics in the cranial thorax; these lymphatics may then leak. Thus a thickened, non-compliant pericardium may contribute to the development of chylo\u00adthorax, and conversely chylothorax may cause pericardial thickening or fibrosing pericarditis. The actual role that the pericardium has in the development of and progression of chylothorax is unknown but pericardectomy, in combination with thoracic duct ligation with or without thoracic omentalization, has been shown in several small case series to achieve a successful resolution of the disease in approximately 75\u201380% cats.18, 19 Subtotal pericardectomy (see Box 48-4) has been successful in some cats as the sole treatment of chylothorax. It has also been suggested that it may be used to treat and/or prevent the serosanguinous effusions that occasionally occur in some patients after thoracic duct ligation.18 Further studies are required to investigate these apparent benefits of pericardectomy.",

Diagnosis can be difficult, and is easier if a small volume of PE is present. Thoracic radiographs may show mild to moderate cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and distension of the caudal vena cava.

If a lateralized heart base mass is confirmed in a patient with a PE, the thoracotomy should be performed on the side of the mass. If a heart base mass is suspected, or has been identified involving both sides of the heart base, a median sternotomy may be the preferred approach.26 A median sternotomy gives good access to both the left and right sides of the heart and allows easier identification of both phrenic nerves at surgery. Thus, pericardectomy may be technically easier via median sternotomy. A median sternotomy also reduces the requirement for manipulation of the heart during surgery, and thus reduces the likelihood of associated intraoperative arrhythmias and it allows exploration of both the right and left sides of the heart base if required.",

There are two described methods of open PDA ligation: the conventional approach and the Jackson\u2013Henderson approach (Box 48-3).Box 48-3Ligation of patent ductus arteriosusA 4th or 5th left intercostal thoracotomy is made (see Box 41-4). The left cranial lung lobe is reflected caudally using a saline soaked swab. The ductus is identified between the aorta positioned dorsally and the pulmonary artery ventrally. If not immediately evident, the ductus should be easily identified by palpation, as obvious fremitus will be present. The vagus nerve is identified as it runs over the ductus, and several stay sutures are placed in the mediastinal pleura above or below the vagus nerve. The mediastinal tissue is carefully incised and the vagus nerve is retracted dorsally or ventrally, respectively. The caudal aspect of the ductus is dissected using roght-angled forceps (Mixter forceps), passed parallel to the transverse plane. Dissection may be entirely external to the pericardium, or extended so that the pericardium is opened, depending on the individual ductus anatomy. The cranial aspect of the ductus is dissected with the tips of the forceps angles approximately 45\u00b0 caudally. Dissection is continued caudally around the medial ductal wall; this must be performed with extreme care and patience to avoid damage to the vessels. A double strand or loop of 3M or 4M silk is soaked in saline and knotted near one end. Once dissection around the medial aspect of the ductus is complete and the tips of the forceps can be seen at the caudal border of the ductus, the knotted suture material is placed between the tips of the forceps and is very carefully passed around the ductus by slowly withdrawing the forceps. The knot is then cut and removed.LigationThe suture on the aortic side is tied first. As the PDA is ligated, in response to the pressure changes there may be a vagally mediated bradycardia (Branham's sign) so an anticholinergic agent such as atropine should be available for administration in this event. It is recommended that the ligature is tied slowly over several minutes to avoid this reflex. The suture on the pulmonic side is then tied and it is confirmed by auscultation using an esophageal stethoscope that the murmur has resolved. There should now be no fremitus on digital palpation. Stay sutures and the swab retracting the left cranial lung lobe are removed and the thorax is lavaged with warm sterile saline. A thoracostomy tube is placed (see Box 41-6) and closure of the thorax is routine.The Jackson\u2013Henderson approach31The Jackson\u2013Henderson approach is an alternate technique of PDA ligation that avoids dissection of the medial aspect of the PDA. The ductus is dissected on the cranial and caudal aspect as described above. The mediastinal pleura is incised between the origin of the left subclavian artery to the origin of the first intercostal artery dorsal to the aorta and the connective tissues on the medial aspect of the aorta at this level are bluntly dissected. A pair of right-angled forceps is passed immediately cranial to the ductus and around the medial aspect of the aorta so their tips can be seen dorsal to the aorta at the site where the mediastinum has been dissected. A knotted loop of 3M or 4M silk is placed in the tips of the forceps and the forceps are gently removed so that the suture material passes from dorsal to ventral around the medial aspect of the aorta immediately cranial to the ductus. This dissection around the medial aspect of the aorta is repeated immediately caudal to the ductus, the free end of the suture material passed into the tips of the forceps, and as they are withdrawn the suture material is taken around the caudal aspect of the ductus. Ligation then proceeds as described above.",

Generally, subtotal pericardectomy (Box 48-4\n) is performed via a right or left 5th intercostal thoracotomy although a median sternotomy can also be used.Box 48-4Subtotal pericardectomyFor subtotal pericardectomy the cat is positioned in lateral recumbency and a right or left 5th intercostal thoracotomy performed (see Box 41-4). A T-shaped incision is made in the pericardium: the base of the T extends from the apex of the heart, and the arms of the T extend around the circumference of the heart just ventral to the phrenic nerves. Stay sutures can be placed in the pericardium just ventral to the phrenic nerve to aid dissection and manipulation. If the pericardium is thickened the pericardial vessels can be hypertrophied and hemorrhage from these vessels can be marked so use of electrocautery applied to individual vessels, or in a cutting/coagulating mode, or use of a vessel sealing device prior to cutting the pericardium is recommended (see Chapter 13). The heart can gently be retracted by an assistant to aid access to the contralateral side of the heart if performing pericardectomy via intercostal thoracotomy. The contralateral phrenic nerve must be identified and preserved. This manipulation can cause arrhythmias and temporary reduction in venous return and cardiac output. The caudoventral mediastinal reflection is ligated, or alternatively a vessel sealing device can be applied to this structure to achieve hemostasis and this tissue is then divided.After subtotal pericardectomy the excised pericardium is submitted for histopathologic analysis, and bacterial and/or fungal culture if considered appropriate. The pleural cavity is lavaged with sterile saline and the remaining pericardium is checked to ensure there is no ongoing hemorrhage. A thoracostomy tube is placed (see Chapter 41) and closure of the thorax is routine. The thoracostomy tube is drained on closure of the thorax, and again once the patient is positioned in sternal recumbency in recovery.",

It is a more challenging surgery with a greater risk of serious complications than subtotal pericardectomy.Box 48-5Total pericardectomyThis surgery for total pericardectomy is performed with the cat in dorsal recumbency via median sternotomy (see Box 41-5). The phrenic nerves are identified as they cross the pericardium. They are preserved by very careful dissection to free them from the pericardium; fine ophthalmic surgical scissors may be helpful to perform this delicate dissection. The apex of the heart is gently shifted to the right side of the thorax to aid access to the left heart base using the surgeon's or surgical assistant's fingers, or a malleable retractor wrapped in a saline-moistened surgical sponge, and likewise the apex is gently shifted to the left to improve access to the right side. The apex of the heart is gently moved in a cranial direction to access the caudal heart base. The anesthetist should be warned prior to these manipulations as they can result in a reduction in cardiac output or arrhythmias. Dissection should be temporarily halted to allow recovery (and adjustment of retraction if necessary) in the event of reduced cardiac output and/or arrhythmias. Saline-moistened umbilical tape is placed around the phrenic nerves once they have been freed from the pericardium, so they can gently be retracted away from the heart. The pericardium is incised/entered towards the apex of the heart and any PE is removed by suction. The pericardium is then incised towards the heart base. Once nearing the base of the heart, stay sutures are placed in the pericardium on either side of the incision to allow retraction and aid exposure so that the great vessels can clearly be identified and avoided. The pericardium is then dissected circumferentially around the heart base, close to the great vessels26 leaving a small remaining \u2018rim\u2019 of pericardium (approximately 5 mm). Great care must be taken to avoid the heart base and great vessels being injured by sharp dissection, or by thermal trauma if using electrocautery or a vessel sealing device to achieve hemostasis of the pericardial vessels.After total pericardectomy the excised pericardium is submitted for histopathologic analysis, and bacterial and/or fungal culture if considered appropriate. The pleural cavity is lavaged with sterile saline and the remaining rim of pericardium is checked to ensure there is no ongoing hemorrhage.

This gives good access whilst avoiding the invasiveness and potential complications of sternotomy or intercostal thoracotomy. If access is inadequate, the celiotomy incision can be extended to a caudal sternotomy.Box 48-6Epicardial pacemaker implantation through a cranial celiotomy and transdiaphragmatic approachAn incision is made from the xiphoid and extending caudally up to the umbilicus. Self-retaining retractors are placed to facilitate access. Neuromuscular blockade may also facilitate surgery. The diaphragm is incised at its midline attachment to the sternum or just to the left of the midline. This incision is extended towards the central tendon. Stay sutures are placed in the diaphragm on either side of the incision to allow retraction and aid exposure (Fig. 48-7). The apex of the heart is readily identified, the pericardium is grasped at its apex using forceps and a 1\u20132 cm incision is made to allow access to the apex of the heart. Stay sutures can be placed in the pericardium on either side of the incision to aid manipulation. An epicardial pacemaker lead is placed in an avascular area at the apex of the left ventricle using either a non-sutured screw-in corkscrew electrode (according to manufacturer directions) or a sutured electrode (Fig. 48-8). If using a sutured technique, the electrode is anchored to the heart with three or four sutures (depending on the actual electrode being used) of 2M polypropylene; pre-placing the sutures before tying is helpful. If the incision in the pericardium is small and herniation of the heart through this defect is impossible it can be left unsutured, otherwise it is repaired using 1.5M monofilament absorbable material placed in a simple continuous pattern. The end of the lead is exited from the thorax through a small stab incision through the diaphragm lateral to the incision made to enter the thorax, leaving a loop of epicardial lead within the pleural cavity to allow for cardiac and respiratory movements, activity, etc., in the conscious patient and thus avoid tension on the lead. The pulse generator is connected to the lead and covered in a saline-soaked swab, or surrounded by abdominal tissues (e.g., omentum) to activate the system (which is unipolar, requiring contact with the body).\n\nAny external pacing is stopped and it is confirmed that the implanted system is achieving pacing as planned, and threshold tests and impedance can be interrogated with an appropriate programmer. The lead can be anchored with a suture to the diaphragm at its entry to the peritoneal cavity but if doing this care must be taken not to damage the insulation layer of the lead. The diaphragmatic incision is closed routinely and the pleural cavity is evacuated via needle or cannula drainage across the diaphragm.Alternatively, a thoracostomy tube can be placed. Some reports describe leaving the pulse generator free within the abdomen, but generally it is recommended that the generator is anchored in a \u2018pocket\u2019 within the abdominal wall. A pocket just large enough to accommodate the transducer is made in the left cranioventral abdominal wall between the transversus abdominis and internal abdominal oblique muscles (Fig. 48-9). A loop of lead is left within the abdomen to avoid tension on the fixation, as above. Any excess lead is loosely coiled around the generator. Usually the generator has a small hole at an edge to allow it to be sutured and anchored to the local tissues. The incision in the internal abdominal oblique is closed using 2M or 3 M polydioxanone placed in a simple continuous pattern. Abdominal closure is routine. A postoperative radiograph of the lateral and/or dorsoventral thorax/abdomen is taken prior to recovery from anesthesia to confirm the electrode, lead, and pacemaker locations and to confirm that the lead is not kinked (Fig. 48-10).\n\n",

Several sites of generator placement have been described including a subcutaneous site overlying the craniolateral abdomen, the caudal thorax, and with and without suture anchorage to local structures such as an adjacent rib. A second incision may be necessary to implant the generator when using an intercostal approach for pacemaker placement. An alternate site for generator placement and anchorage, if the latissimus dorsi was retracted dorsally rather than incised during thoracotomy, is under this muscle adjacent to the thoracotomy site (but not overlying it). The generator can then be sutured to the external thoracic muscles.",

The most serious, potentially fatal intraoperative complication is rupture of the PDA, aorta or pulmonary artery during dissection around the ductus. Small tears to these vessels may be managed by the immediate application of digital pressure, but continued dissection may result in further hemorrhage as the tear in the damaged vessel may enlarge. A decision must be made whether to continue with surgery, or abandon the procedure on this occasion but second surgeries can be difficult due to scarring and fibrosis at the surgical site. If hemorrhage is marked, a vascular occlusion clamp (Satinsky) is applied to the aorta cranial to the ductus and caudal to the brachycephalic and left subclavian arteries. This allows blood flow to continue to the head and heart. Another vascular clamp is placed across the aorta caudal to the ductus to prevent retrograde aortic hemorrhage. Hemorrhage from the ductus will now be from the pulmonary artery, which is a lower pressure system so hemorrhage should not be as severe. Various techniques are suggested for resolving intraoperative hemorrhage including vascular repair using 1M polypropylene if the tear can be identified, ductal closure using polytetrafluoroethylene felt pledget buttressed mattress sutures, or ductal division between clamps and oversewing of the ductal edges.",
