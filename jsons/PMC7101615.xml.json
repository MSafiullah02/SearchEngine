Compared to liver transplantation from a deceased donor, living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) may reduce the waiting time, particularly for patients suffering from hepatic encephalopathy [3]. The survival outcome of LDLT for patients with hepatic encephalopathy is controversial [4, 5]. LDLT using a right-lobe graft was shown to improve the overall survival rates of these patients [6, 7]. However, most of the previously reported causes of death of these patients were neurological damage and infections [8]. In this article, we reviewed the clinical outcomes of emergency LDLT in our institution to clarify the risk factors for postoperative mortality that may lead to improved survival rates for patients with emergency LDLT; namely, for those with hepatic encephalopathy irrespective of the presence of either acute liver failure or acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF).",

Serum (1 \u2192 3)-\u03b2-d-glucan detection is quick and straightforward, with results being obtainable within a day. Moreover, in a previous study, plasma (1 \u2192 3)-\u03b2-d-glucan elevation was detected earlier than a positive fungal culture in half of recorded fungemic episodes [25]. Aging is known to be related to immunodeficiency [26] as a result of dysfunction of T cells. The pathogenesis of low preoperative PaO2/FiO2 ratios could be multifactorial, including atelectasis caused by pleural effusion, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), and these easily lead to pulmonary infection [27].",

Although the perioperative improvement of nutrition is also necessary [29], preoperative ingestion was shown to be fundamentally difficult because emergency LDLT patients often experience a hepatic coma. Therefore, preoperative enteral nutrition using a nasointestinal feeding tube may be effective.
