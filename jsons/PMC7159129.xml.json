Following the colonization of Australia, Aboriginal people embraced the European dog (Canis lupus familiaris) which has resulted in numerous problems that were not previously seen. Dingoes breed once per year (Catling, Corbett, & Newsome, 1992; Corbett, 1995) compared with domestic dogs which will breed twice per year and have a greater number of pups in their litters (Catling et al., 1992). This has resulted in many communities being burdened with canine overpopulation and a poor state of dog health which not only affects animal welfare but human social welfare (Constable, Brown, Dixon, & Dixon, 2008). This is a cause for concern and has resulted in the implementation of numerous dog health programmes since the mid\u20101980s (English, 2000).",

The effect of resultant dog health programmes on Aboriginal health has been the focus of considerable debate. The main concern is that Aboriginal health funding is redirected to dog health under the assumption that improving dog health will improve community health (Currie, 1995). The debate was largely extinguished in the Northern Territory following the research conducted by Walton et al. (1999, 2004), that used microsatellite typing to show that scabies mites from dogs and humans group separately in a phylogenetic dichotomous tree which they suggested demonstrated separate transmission cycles. The ramifications of this have been that many communities are now under the impression that dogs pose no significant public health risks. Several reviews have been published trying to assess this risk, but none have explained their methods, nor critiqued the research using a specified system (Currie, 1995; Gaskin, Bentham, Cromar, & Fallowfield, 2007; Raw, 2001). Zoonotic and public health literature reviews have been scrutinized for their lack of methodological soundness in review techniques, because they are more likely to contain bias or errors (Waddell et al., 2009).",

Although a recent national study found a low prevalence of T. canis in domestic dogs in veterinary clinics and refuges (1.2%) (Palmer, Thompson, Traub, Rees, & Robertson, 2008), a recent wild dog survey, which may better reflect the zoonotic risk from free\u2010ranging community dogs, reported prevalences of 46% (Smout, Thompson, & Skerratt, 2013). Mizgajska (2001) concluded that the prevalence of human toxocariasis is proportional to soil contamination with infective eggs of Toxocara spp. Shield et al. (2015) found 21% of people seropositive for T. canis in their studies in Arnhem Land in the mid 1990s. Toxocariasis is now being heralded as the most common human parasitic worm infection in the United States, and with its high prevalence in developing countries, it is considered that its global importance may be greatly underestimated (Hotez & Wilkins, 2009).",

The highly variable symptoms of giardiasis include persistent diarrhoea, abdominal pain and rapid weight loss (Thompson, Reynoldson et al., 1993). It is now commonly thought that although dogs can carry strains of Giardia which are potentially infective to humans, transmission mainly occurs among humans (Hopkins et al., 1997; Robertson & Thompson, 2002). In support of this Hopkins et al. (1997) found differences in genotypes of Giardia isolated from 13 Aboriginal people from Fitzroy Crossing and nine dogs that had been culled from the same area. They found that the samples separated into four different genetic groups. All of the human and three dog isolates were contained in groups 1 and 2, while groups 3 and 4 consisted entirely of Giardia samples from dogs. In contrast, Traub et al. (2004) studied zoonotic Giardia transmission in a remote community in India and found that Giardia isolates derived from dogs were placed within the human genetic groupings. Furthermore, humans residing in a house that owned dogs and where one dog was infected with Giardia were significantly more likely to be infected, than humans that did not have a dog or a dog infected with Giardia. In addition, genetically identical isolates were found in dogs and humans from the same household in two cases. Together, these are taken as strong evidence in support of the potential for zoonotic transmission.",

Giardia isolates are prone to competitive exclusion, enabling selection of host\u2010specific Giardia assemblages (Thompson, 2000). It is also possible that the source of dog samples within the Aboriginal study is biased and may therefore be masking zoonotic transmission. According to Hopkins et al. (1997), the dog isolates used in the study were retrieved from culled dogs from the same area as the human participants (n = 9). However, there is nothing to suggest that the dogs used in the study were from the same household as human participants or that the dogs were owned by anyone. Generally, dogs that are euthanased by councils are unhealthy, stray dogs. Sampling from the stray/wild dog population might bias the result because the major form of Giardia transmission, dog to dog, would predominately select for dog\u2010specific Giardia assemblages. Further research is required to ascertain the potential and frequency of zoonotic transmission of Giardia from dogs to their owners in Aboriginal communities.",

Molecular techniques have been used to identify R. felis infection in cat fleas from multiple sites in Western Australia (Schloderer, Owen, Clark, Stenos, & Fenwick, 2006). Williams, Izzard, Graves, Stenos, and Kelly (2011) reported R. felis infection in two adults and three children from Victoria. Previously, many infections in Australia may have been misdiagnosed as murine typhus as serological diagnosis was not specific and was typically confounded by cross\u2010reactivity with typhus group rickettsiae (Teoh et al., 2016). Dogs are often infested with cat fleas, and infected dogs can appear physically healthy, which may be characteristic of reservoir hosts of R. felis (Hii et al., 2011). Further study is needed to determine the pathogenicity of this infection in dogs.",

It is outside the scope of this paper to predict future funding decisions and distribution of resources. However, we believe that we have shown that there is insufficient scientific evidence to prove that zoonotic transmission is not important. There is evidence that zoonotic transmission is occurring with S. scabiei being transmitted from dogs to people. A coordinated approach is necessary and dog health should be added to the list of potentially hazardous environmental issues to be addressed within Aboriginal communities. Dog health programmes are still extremely important for animal welfare and providing relevant information to pet owners in Aboriginal Australian communities regardless of zoonotic potential. Furthermore, as there can be no disputing the significant problem of dog bites as a serious canine zoonotic issue (Abreu & D'adonna, 2009); the safety of community members from pack dogs should be motivation enough for the employment of animal control officers in Aboriginal communities.",

The recent findings of A. ceylanicum in dogs (Palmer et al., 2007), dingoes (Smout et al., 2013) and humans (Koehler et al., 2013) in Australia should ensure caution is used when diagnosing infections such as A. duodenale in humans.
