At present, MA typically entails a visit to a clinician or facility that provides abortion where an ultrasound or pelvic examination and often blood tests are performed to evaluate eligibility before pills are dispensed. Many abortion providers require a follow-up ultrasound or blood test after treatment to confirm abortion completion. However, research and experience have demonstrated that these tests, which inherently involve physical contact between patient and health care worker, are usually unnecessary for safe and effective MA [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Indeed, over the past 15 years, international organizations have provided mifepristone and misoprostol by mail to tens of thousands of patients screened only by history [8], [9], [10], [11]. A prospective study conducted in 2015-2016 in the United States, Mexico, and Moldova provided 406 MAs without screening ultrasound or pelvic examination [12]. No serious adverse events were reported that resulted from the omission of the tests, and participants were highly satisfied.",

The protocol is intended to serve as a guidance; abortion providers should use clinical judgment when adapting it for their practice settings and patient populations.

We note, though, that 2014 guidelines issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Family Planning [17] as well as the mifepristone label approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2016 specify a 70-day limit.

Data from studies that compared LMP-based GA estimates to ultrasound-based estimates suggest that this fraction tends to be higher in patient populations that include more patients with advanced GA [19], [20] and that it may be reduced by decreasing the LMP-based GA cutoff [19]. Reassuringly, the largest study, which was conducted in the United States in 2005-2007 [21], found that only 35 (1%) of 4,226 MA patients who were certain that their LMPs had started \u226477 days prior had GAs >77 days by ultrasound examination. Furthermore, international studies that included nearly two thousand patients treated with mifepristone and one or more misoprostol doses at 13-24 weeks of gestation reported efficacy and safety similar to that expected in earlier gestation: >93% of patients aborted without further intervention, 0.7-4% required transfusion, and no patient required hysterectomy or died [22]. Therefore, we expect that serious adverse health consequences of GA underestimation based on LMP will be rare. Nevertheless, clinicians using the no-test approach to MA should have a plan for managing or referring patients who may need a second trimester procedure to complete the abortion.",

The sample protocol does not exclude patients who report menstrual irregularity or recent use of hormonal contraceptives.

            "text": "MA with mifepristone and misoprostol is contraindicated in patients with ectopic pregnancy not because the drugs are dangerous for such patients but because the regimen is not a proven treatment for this condition. The sample no-test protocol excludes patients with significant symptoms of or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy; recent vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain, prior permanent contraception, prior ectopic pregnancy, or intrauterine device in place at conception [23], [24]. We do not exclude patients who report prior pelvic inflammatory disease because unconfirmed diagnoses of this condition are associated with only a mildly increased risk [24]. We recognize that the listed criteria will not identify every patient with ectopic pregnancy; an estimated half of all patients with this condition have no risk factors [25]. However, published and emerging data suggest that the incidence of ectopic pregnancy among patients seeking MA is very low, <1% [26], [27]. Moreover, substantial data [28], [29], [30], [31], [32] and current clinical MA guidelines [16], [33] support treatment of patients in whom ectopic pregnancy has not been definitively excluded because the condition can be detected and managed afterwards. Thus, this aspect of the protocol is consistent with the standard of care.",

The sample protocol is consistent with this conclusion. In addition, it specifies that testing is unnecessary for patients who can report a Rh-positive blood type or who are certain that they want no future children after the planned abortion.

The instruction sheet directs patients to contact the abortion provider if specified symptoms occur or the HSPT result is positive. Research has shown that patients can safely use these tools on their own to recognize when follow-up is needed [48], [49], and indeed patient-controlled follow-up is widely used for MA follow-up by provider organizations in multiple European countries [50], [51], [52]. However, the sample no-test protocol recommends a planned follow-up contact with the provider one week after dispensing the abortifacient medications to confirm absence of symptoms of ongoing or undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy or other potential complications.

Nevertheless, the sample no-test protocol recommends a HSPT 4 weeks after misoprostol use to confirm pregnancy termination. Available data indicate that 5-25% of HSPTs performed about a month after MA treatment produce positive results, nearly all of which are \u201cfalse positives\u201d in patients who no longer have viable pregnancies [44], [45]. Therefore, the sample protocol recommends that two HSPTs be provided initially to each patient. The patient should be instructed to call the provider if the result of the initial 4-week test is positive. If the patient is asymptomatic, a repeat test one week later may be appropriate. If the patient has symptoms of ongoing or ectopic pregnancy or the second HSPT result is positive, further evaluation is indicated. The specific procedures for this evaluation should address the patient's individual clinical situation and may include ultrasound, serial serum HCG levels, additional urine pregnancy testing, or aspiration and tissue examination.",

In addition, each patient should be explicitly informed that LMP-based dating may underestimate GA, in which case efficacy may be lower than expected, bleeding and cramping may be heavier, and, rarely, fetal tissue may be visible. Moreover, patients should understand that without ultrasound, ectopic pregnancy will not be definitively excluded before treatment. To increase the chance of abortion success and reduce the time to diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy or MA complications, patients should be advised to diligently follow all instructions provided. However, patients should also be advised that serious adverse events of no-test abortion are expected to be rare and that side effects of MA can often be managed remotely. To avoid unnecessary infectious exposure during a pandemic as well as excess cost and inconvenience, patients should contact the abortion provider before seeking in-person care.",

Omitting unnecessary use of ultrasound, examination, and laboratory tests before MA can reduce barriers to this essential service by decreasing cost and enhancing convenience and comfort. The no-test approach can enable provision of abortion in new venues and by new categories of providers, and it can facilitate new service delivery models, such as synchronous or asynchronous telehealth, stationary or mobile \u201cmini-clinics\u201d, pill pick-up arrangements, or dispensing via lockboxes or, potentially, by mail [7], [54]. If the no-test strategy results in earlier treatment, it may increase MA success rates [14], [43], [55]. Details of the no-test MA protocol will certainly need to be revised as new evidence emerges, but we anticipate that this approach to providing the service will continue to be beneficial for both patients and abortion providers even after the current epidemic resolves.",
