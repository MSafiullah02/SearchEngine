            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, resulted in millions infected worldwide and an immediate need for antiviral treatments. The main protease (M pro ) in SARS-CoV-2 is a viable drug target because of its essential role in the cleavage of the virus polypeptide and subsequent viral replication. Feline infectious peritonitis, a fatal infection in cats caused by a coronavirus, was successfully treated previously with a dipeptide-based protease inhibitor. Here we show this drug, GC376, and its analog GC373, are effective inhibitors of the M pro from both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with IC 50 values in the nanomolar range. Crystal structures of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 M pro with these inhibitors have a covalent modification of the nucleophilic Cys145. NMR analysis reveals that inhibition proceeds via reversible formation of a hemithioacetal. GC373 and GC376 are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture, with EC 50 values near one micromolar and little to no toxicity. These protease inhibitors are soluble, non-toxic, and bind reversibly. They are strong drug candidates for the treatment of human coronavirus infections because they have already been successful in animals (cats). The work here lays the framework for their use in human trials for the treatment of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak evolved into a pandemic due to the virulent nature of SARS-CoV-2, reaching over 3 million cases worldwide by end of April 2020, with the number of infected growing rapidly worldwide 1 . This current scenario contrasts the less virulent SARS outbreak in 2002-03, which had only 8000 cases and 774 deaths (WHO, 2004) 2 . There is an urgent need for antiviral therapies for acute COVID-19 infections, especially until an efficacious vaccine is developed. The main protease of the coronavirus is a strong drug target due to its essential nature for virus maturation and subsequent infection 3 . Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that hijack the host's translational machinery to generate viral proteins. The viral RNA encodes two overlapping polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab, which are 450 kD and 750 kD, respectively. The polyproteins need to be cleaved in order to release individual functional proteins for viral replication and transcription. Viral encoded proteases include the main protease (M pro ), also called 3CL pro , and a papain-like protease (PL pro ). M pro cleaves the polyproteins at 11 positions primarily at conserved Leu Gln | Ser Ala Gly sequences, which allows for virus assembly. Given its crucial role in virus replication, the SARS-CoV-2 M pro is a prominent drug target for COVID-19 antiviral therapy. The coronavirus M pro is a cysteine protease for which many different inhibitor classes exist 4 . Protease inhibitors are common drug candidates if they meet the requirements of low toxicity, solubility, and reversibility 5 . Several proteases have been identified as molecular targets and used for the development of novel classes of drugs 5 including Tipranavir for the treatment of HIV 6 . However, inhibition of cysteine proteases by thiol reactive species is often untenable for human drugs unless the inhibitor is reversible. Michael acceptor drugs that are irreversible in vivo, such as Rupintrivir, have failed in clinical trials due to low 3 bioavailabilty 3 . Undesired irreversible reaction occurs with numerous mammalian thiols to destroy the inhibitor. Reaction with host protein thiols could also potentially lead to acute toxicity or immune reaction. In this regard, the reversible reaction of thiols with aldehyde inhibitors to make hemithioacetals presents a unique opportunity for effective cysteine protease inhibition, as they can potentially bind more effectively in the active site of their target protein than with other thiols 7 . Water soluble aldehyde bisulphite adducts are readily made, reversibly from the parent aldehyde under physiological conditions, and can be ideal prodrugs for cysteine protease inhibition as described below.",

Peptide aldehydes and their bisulphite derivatives were later used to inhibit the main protease of the Feline Coronavirus FCoV 9 . FCoV generally causes mild symptoms, but it can lead to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is usually fatal in cats. The bisulphite adduct GC376, which converts readily to peptide aldehyde GC373, was well tolerated and able to reverse the infection in cats 10 . This, along with other studies that included ferret and mink coronavirus M pro , demonstrated the broad specificity of this protease inhibitor 11 . A crystal structure of GC376 was solved with the homologous MERS M pro and demonstrated a covalent interaction with the catalytic cysteine of the M pro 12 . Recently, structures of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease were solved with a peptide-based ketoamide inhibitor 13 and various re-purposed drugs such as anti-cancer agents 14 . However, these M pro inhibitors have not been tested in animal models of coronavirus infection nor have they been reported in human or animal trials for SARS.",

This compound consists of a glutamine surrogate in the substrate, P1 position, a Leu in P2 position and benzene ring in the P3 position, which reflects the known specificity for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro . The SARS-CoV-2 M pro was cloned as a SUMO-tag fusion, which allowed for high-yield expression, enhanced stability, and generation of native N-and C-termini (Extended data, Figure S2 and S3) . Similarly, SARS-CoV M pro was expressed and purified to obtain native N-and C-termini according to previous methods 8 . Kinetic parameters for both the SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2-M pro were determined using a synthetic peptide FRETsubstrate with an anthranilate-nitrotyrosine donor-acceptor pair (Abz-SVTLQSG-Tyr NO2 R -Extended data, Figure S4 ) as it displays over 10-fold more sensitivity compared to the equivalent EDANS-Dabcyl system 15 . Both SARS-CoV-2 M pro and SARS-CoV M pro exhibited cooperative substrate binding of the FRET-substrate (Extended data, Figure S5) IC 50 measurements revealed that both GC373 and GC376 inhibit the SARS-CoV M pro and the SARS-CoV-2 M pro in vitro at nanomolar concentrations (Figure 1B and C) . For the SARS-CoV-2 M pro , IC 50 for GC373 and GC376 are 0.40\u00b10.05 \u00b5M and 0.19\u00b10.04 \u00b5M, respectively. This is in agreement with studies of these compounds with M pro from related viruses. For FCoV M pro the IC 50 for GC376 was 0.04 \u00b10.04 \u00b5M and for GC373 was 0.02 \u00b10.01 5 \u00b5M 9 . For SARS-CoV M pro we observed an enhanced IC 50 , demonstrating the broad inhibition by both compounds, with GC373 and GC376 being 0.070 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5M and 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b5M, respectively. The bisulphite adduct GC376 shows slightly higher potency for both enzymes compared to the free aldehyde. Our in vitro IC 50 values for GC373 and GC376 reflect tight binding for the SARS-CoV-2 M pro compared to other inhibitors tested in vitro, e.g. ebselen (IC 50 0.67 \u00b5M) 14 , tideglusib (IC 50 1.55 \u00b5M) 14 , carmofur (IC 50 1.82 \u00b5M) 14 , disulfiram (IC 50 9.35 \u00b5M) 14 , shikonin (IC 50 15.75 \u00b5M) 14 , PX-12 (IC 50 21.39 \u00b5M) 14 . Both GC373 and GC376 are also more potent than recently reported ketoamide inhibitors (IC 50 of the lead compound 0.67 \u00b5M) 13 .",

In both structures the peptidyl inhibitor is covalently attached to Cys-145 as a hemithioacetal, showing that as expected the bisulphite group leaves GC376 (Extended data, Figure S6 ). In contrast to the MERS M pro -GC376 structure, the SARS-CoV-2 M pro electron density indicated the formation of only one enantiomer for this inhibitor 12 . A strong hydrogen bond network is established from side chain of His163 and backbone amide of His164, and Glu166, with backbone contributions from Gly143, Ser144 and Cys145 defining the oxyanion hole (Figure 3) . Together this provides strong binding and a low IC 50 for the inhibitor. The glutamine surrogate in the substrate P1 position interacts with the side chain of His163, while the Leu in P2 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket, representing the S2 subsite of the enzyme. Similar to what was observed in the MERS-M pro -GC376 structure 12 , the benzyl ring and the b-lactam of the Gln surrogate forms a stacked hydrophobic interaction, which stabilizes the inhibitor in the active site of the protease.

All three structures were determined by molecular replacement with the crystal structure of the free enzyme of the SARS-CoV2 M pro (PDB entry 6Y7M as search model, using the Phaser program from Phenix. Ligand Fit from Phenix was employed for the fitting of both inhibitors in the density of pre-calculated map from Phenix refinement, using the ligand code K36. Refinement of the three structures was performed with phenix.refine in Phenix software. Statistics of diffraction, data processing and model refinement are given in (Table S1 ). All spectra were run \"locked\" on the 2 H resonance signal and chemical shifts were referenced using the residual proton 1 HOD signal position 7 (i.e. 4.7 ppm) prior to saturation. One dimensional 1 H data were acquired using presaturation 8, 9 for residual 1 HOD solvent suppression, followed by a 90\u00b0 excitation pulse and data acquisition. The saturation carrier position amplitude were manually optimized using a position sweep array and based on the calibrated high-power pulse, respectively. Saturation was applied directly on the water resonance (i.e. depending on water suppression efficacy and the ability to avoid analog to digital and/or receiver overloads with sufficient gain for data acquisition). The saturation was applied with a gammaB1 induced field strength of ~80 Hz 10 , and a duration of 2 seconds. The 90\u00b0 pulse width was determined after tuning and matching each sample, using one-pulse nutation optimization 11 . Other specific 1D acquisition parameter settings were: sweep width of 14044 Hz, acquisition time 2.5 seconds, with 70224 total (i.e. real plus imaginary) data points.",

Next, Boc2O (48.62 g, 222.3 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added in one portion, and then the reaction mixture was capped with pressure-equalizing Ar and stirred at rt for 3 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure to produce a white solid. The solid was triturated by suspension in Et2O (500 mL), and collected by filtration. The solid was washed with additional volumes of Et2O (3 \u00d7 250 mL), and then concentrated in vacuo to produce a crude oil. The crude product was purified using silica column chromatography (50% EtOAc in hexanes), and yielded aclear, yellow oil (50.44 g, 183.2 mmol, 91%): Rf = 0.61 on SiO2, 50% EtOAc in hexanes; IR (DCM cast film, \u03bdmax / cm -1 ) 3369, 2979, 2956, 1742, 1717, 1518, 1439, compound was synthesized based on a modified literature procedure 1 . (1)(1.00 g, 3.62 mmol, 1.00 equiv) was deposited in a flame-dried RBF under argon, to which 10.34 mL of freshly distilled THF was added. The oily starting material was dissolved at rt before LiHMDS (1.0 M in THF, 7.82 mL, 7.82 mmol, 2.16 equiv) was added over a period of 2 min at -78\u00b0C. The reaction mixture went from clear and nearly colourless to light yellow, and was allowed to stir at -78 \u00b0C for 1 h. Next BrCH2CN (0.270 mL, 3.88 mmol, 1.07 equiv) was slowly added over a period of 1 h (addition rate of ca. 0.02 mL / 5 min), while maintaining reaction temperature at -78 \u00b0C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at -78 \u00b0C over a period of 2 h. After 2 h, some starting material remained but the reaction mixture was quenched by addition of 5.2 mL of HCl at -78 \u00b0C.The reaction mixture was then removed from the cooling bath to allow the ice in the flask to melt, stirring for 50 min. The mixture was then extracted with EtOAc (3x). Thecombined EtOAc layers were washed with H2O (2x) and brine (1x). Drying over MgSO4 and concentration by rotovap furnishes a dark brown oil. This oil was then dissolved in 5.0 mL of DCM, to which activated charcoal (0.35 g) and silica (1.40 g) was added. The slurry was spun on a rotovap without heat or vacuum for 1 h. Afterwards, the charcoal and silica was filtered through a celite pad and the filtride washed with additional volumes of DCM. Concentration of the filtrate furnishes a yellow oil. This oil was then transferred to a flame-dried RBF under argon, to which CoCl2\u20226H2O (0.290 g, 1.22 mmol, 0.67 equiv) was added. The material was then dissolved in 20.0 mL of freshly distilled MeOH. The solution was then cooled to 0 \u00b0C and NaBH4 (0.462 g, 12.20 mmol, 6.74 equiv) was added in multiple portions over a period of 30 min. Upon addition of NaBH4, the reaction mixture immediately turned black and started bubbling. Once addition was finished and bubbling slowed, the reaction mixture was capped under a blanket of pressure-equalizing argon, removed from the ice bath, and allowed to warm to rt, stirring for 24 h. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated on the rotovap to a minimal volume. To the obtained residue was then added 1 M of citric acid at 0 \u00b0C.The mixture was further diluted with EtOAc and extracted with EtOAc (3x). The combined EtOAc layers were then washed with sat. NaHCO3 (2x) and brine (1x). Drying over Na2SO4 and removal of solvent furnishes a very pale yellow oil as crude. This material was then purified via flash column chromatography using an eluent system of EtOAc.

The solution was then concentrated on rotovap and co-evaporated with DCM (5x). In a separate flame-dried RBF under argon was deposited Cbz-Leu-OH (90% purity, 4.12 g, 13.97 mmol, 1.0 equiv), HATU (5.31 g, 13.97 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The material was then dissolved in 70 mL of DMF. Next, HOAT (0.6 M in DMF, 2.33 mL, 1.40 mmol, 0.1 equiv) was added, followed by DIPEA (7.30 mL, 41.91 mmol, 3.0 equiv). The reaction mixture turned bright yellow and was incubated for 5 min. The previously concentrated Boc-deprotected material was then dissolved in 70 mL of DCM and added dropwise to the incubating solution, with the bright yellow colour quickly fading. The reaction mixture was the capped under a blanket of argon and allowed to react at rt for 1.5 h. Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with H2O and EtOAc. The layers were separated and the H2O layer was further extracted with EtOAc (3x). The combined EtOAc layers were then washed with sat. NaHCO3 (2x), 1 M HCl (2x), and brine (1x). Drying over Na2SO4 and concentrating on the rotovap furnishes a crude yellow oil. This material was used without further purification but may be purified by flash column chromatography over silica, using an eluent system of pure EtOAc. Product elution was monitored by TLC and KMnO4 staining (Rf = 0.43, 5/95 MeOH/EtOAc), and concentration of product fractions furnishes a transparent, slightly yellow oil as the desired product (6.056 g, 13.97 mmol, 100%).

This solution was bubbled under Ar for 2.5 h to load the desired amino acid onto the solid support, continually topping up the CH2Cl2 to maintain an approximately 10 mL volume. To end cap any remaining trityl groups, dry MeOH was added to the vessel (0.8 mL per gram of resin) and bubbled under Ar for 15 minutes. After draining, the resin was washed with dry DMF (3 \u00d7 10 mL), dry CH2Cl2 (3 \u00d7 10 mL), and then with dry MeOH (3 \u00d7 10 mL) for one min each.

Cloning, Expression and Purification of SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro DNA encoding the main protease M pro from SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from BioBasic Inc. (Ontario, Canada) and codon optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. The gene was cloned into the pET SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) expression vector (Invitrogen). Clones were sequenced to ensure that the SARS-CoV-2 M pro protein was in frame with the His-tagged SUMO fusion protein. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and the E. coli transformant was grown in Luria Broth, Miller at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (220 rpm) to an OD600 of 0.6-0.7 using kanamycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) as selective pressure. Expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG to the cell culture and the culture was grown for an additional 4-5 h at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C) and suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice and the lysate was centrifuged (17000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C) to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was isolated and, after adding imidazole (5 mM), mixed with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The mixture was loaded on a fritted column and allowed to flow by gravity at 4 \u00b0C. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. The fusion protein was eluted using 2 CV of lysis buffer containing increased concentrations of imidazole (40, 60, 80, 100, 200 and 500 mM). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those that contained the fusion protein were pooled together, dialyzed against lysis buffer containing 1 mM DTT at 4 \u00b0C and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore) with a MWCO of 10 kDa. The fusion protein was digested by His-tagged SUMO protease (McLab, South San Francisco, CA) at 4 \u00b0C for 1-2 h to remove the SUMO tag. The cleavage mixture was added to Ni-NTA resin and loaded on a fritted column. The flow through containing SARS-CoV-2 M pro was collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Immunoglobulin G, 166 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; and lysozyme, 15kDa were used as calibration standards. Fractions containing the SARS-CoV-2 M pro protein were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 filter with a MWCO of 10 kDa. In addition, a sample of the fusion protein SUMO-SARS-CoV-2 M pro was also purified using size exclusion chromatography and concentrated as described above. The plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV M pro with an N-terminal His-tag upstream of an FactorX cleavage site was the kind gift of Dr. Michael James, which was expressed a purified according to previous protocols 3 . Mass Spectrometry of SARS-CoV-2 M pro The mass of the free SARS-CoV-2 M pro was confirmed by HR-MALDI on a MALDI-TOF (Bruker Ultrafelxtreme, Bruker Daltronics, USA) and LC-MS on an ESI-TOF instrument (Agilent Technologies 6220, California, USA) using electrospray ionization. Enzyme Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV M pro A synthesized fluorescent substrate containing the cleavage site (indicated by the arrow, \u2193) of SARS-CoV-2 M pro (2-Abz-SVTLQ\u2193SG-Tyr(NO2)-R-NH2) was used for the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cleavage assay 4 . The protease reactions of both SARS-CoV-2 M pro and SARS-CoV M pro towards fluorescent substrate was performed in activity buffer (20 mM Bis Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mM DTT) at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min. The final concentration of proteases used in the assay was fixed at 80 nM and the concentrations of the substrate were varied from 0.1 to 500 \u03bcM. Reaction was started with the enzyme and the fluorescence signal of the Abz-SVTLQ peptide cleavage product was monitored at an emission wavelength of 420 nm with excitation at 320 nm, using an Flx800 fluorescence spectrophotometer (BioTek). Before kinetic calculations, it was verified that the proportionality between the fluorescence emitted and the amount of the substrate used in the assay was linear. The minimal concentration of the enzyme and time of reaction that gave a linear dependence of amount of generated product with time was chosen. Initial velocities in corresponding relative fluorescence units per unit of time (\u0394RFU/s) were converted to the amount of the cleaved substrate per unit of time (\u03bcM/s) by fitting to the calibration curve of free Aminobenzoyl-SVTLQ. All data are corrected for inner filter effects by an adopted literature protocol. In short, the fluorescence signal (RFU) at each substrate concentration was determined and defined as f(FRET). Then, 5uL free Aminobenzoyl-SVTLQ at final 5uM was added to each concentration and fluorescence was taken f(FRET+ Aminobenzoyl-SVTLQ). Simultaneously, a reference reading was taken with the same free Aminobenzoyl-SVTLQ concentration and defined as f(ref). The inner-filter correction was obtained as:",

Carbonchemical shift referencing and carrier position (100 ppm) was based on indirect IUPAC 1 H referencing 15 . The carbon carrier position was moved (e.g. 80, 90, or 100 ppm) to eliminate the possibility of peaks of interest near the carrier position being artifactual (i.e. quadrature \"glitch\").For processing of NMR data, all dimensions were zero-filled to twice the number of acquired points. A line-broadening apodization function of 0.25 Hz was applied for 1 H-1D spectra while a \u03c0/2 squared sine-bell weighting function was utilized for the 2D-HSQC (both dimensions).

A 50 \u00b5L solution of 2.6 mg/mL enzyme was added to the spin filter and diluted to 300 \u00b5L, then spun at 6600 g for 18 min. This was repeated an additional 2 times, and the sample was then made up to 300\u00b5L in volume and transferred to the NMR tube. Samples of enzyme in the presence of inhibitor were prepared by administering an additional 1.5 \u00b5L of 13 C labelled GC373 solution (20 mM in DMSO) to the aforementioned enzyme sample. Sample data was acquired in 5 mm Varian specific D2O susceptibility matched microcell (i.e. BMS-00V) Shigemi NMR tubes purchased from Wilmad Lab-glass Inc. All NMR solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. NMR tubes were washed between runs using 5 rinses of D2O, and then inverted to air dry overnight. Small volume additions (e.g. inhibitor added to enzyme) to samples in ShigemiNMR tubes were done by adding to the top of the outer NMR tube with the inner plunger removed, and then carefully tapping the sample tube in an almost horizontal position while rotating to break the surface tension and allow sample liquid to flow up the tube. The sample volume was allowed to travel up until making contact with the additional material. The tube was then repeatedly whipped downward to move the material to the bottom. This was repeated several times so that additions were rinsed down into the microcell ensuring proper mixing. NMR experiments were collected at 16.45 T (i.e. 700 MHz) using a 4-channel 'VNMRS' (Varian/Agilent) NMR spectrometer (VNMRJ 4.2 patch110 software) with anAgilent 7620 automatic sample handling system. A 5mm triple resonance cryogenically cooled (20 K) 1 H direct-detection (i.e. with 13 C 15 N on the outer coil) probe was utilized for all experiments. The probe had cooled preamplifiers on the 1H and 13C detection channels. The sample temperature was calibrated to 27\u00b0C using methanol 6 .",
