This was 20 observed by Klok et al., who found that despite thromboprophylaxis, patients developed 21 venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism (PE) being the most common. Incidences of 22 arterial thrombosis including ischaemic strokes were also noted. 1 23 24 A recent study identified that those who were critically ill with SARS-CoV-2 had elevated D-25 dimer levels, fibrinogen, and fibrinogen degradation products compared to healthy controls. 2 26 This may be due to endothelial injury resulting in thrombin generation and fibrinolysis shut 27 down, contributing to a hypercoagulable state. A similar relationship between acute 28 respiratory distress syndrome (which can occur in patients with COVID-19) and deep vein 29 thrombosis (DVT) has been shown with Influenza A (H1N1). 3 The inflammatory disease 30 process, prolonged hospital stay, and pre-existing co-morbidities can contribute to venous 31 thromboembolism (VTE). 4 A summary of these factors can be seen in Figure 1 . 32 33 SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to gain entry to cells by binding to Angiotensin-converting 34 enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, and the spike (S) protein plays a vital role in this. 5 This protein 35 is cleaved by plasmin, which is found to be higher in individuals with cardiovascular disease, 36 thus potentially making them more susceptible to poorer outcomes. 6,7 The interaction of 37 SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 receptor may cause endothelial damage as a five-fold rise of von 38",

However, they showed normal or increased fibrinogen, platelet count, PT, and 79 aPTT, which is consistent with hypercoagulability than DIC. 18 Although both groups of 80 patients were admitted to ICU, these differences may be explained by the stage of the disease. Myocardial injury can also occur through various mechanisms in COVID-19 patients, 95 especially in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Systemic inflammation, as well 96 as shear stress due to increased coronary blood flow, can result in plaque rupture, thus 97 causing myocardial infarction. 22 A study showed that acute cardiac injury is more common 98 with raised troponin-I as well as significant ST elevation, which could mimic acute coronary 99 occlusion.

However, this treatment continues if 147 there is clinical evidence of PE, DVT or other thrombotic events regardless of D-Dimer level. 148The D-Dimer level is done daily to assess the progress of such patients in terms of VTE risk. 149At least twice daily, a full clinical assessment of those patients is done to determine clinical 150 progress and looking for clinical signs of VTE. Among these 35 cases, 20 of them were 151 intubated at the initial presentation, and 6 of them required to be prone at some stage of their 9 stay in the ICU. No incidents of pulmonary embolism have been reported, but one case shown the increased risk of mortality associated with VTE. 10 A meta-analysis 158 that examined 9 studies with over 1,000 COVID-19 patients looked at the mean differences 159 in platelet count between patients with and without severe disease.30  Overall, there was a 160 significantly lower platelet count in patients with more severe COVID-19. Evaluating platelet 161 count may be an affordable and accessible biomarker to assess disease severity and risk of 162 coagulopathies. Similarly, elevated plasmin has been seen in the setting of acute respiratory 163 distress syndrome (ARDS) and may be useful as a biomarker in COVID patients.31  The use 164 of point-of-care ultrasound screening for DVT may also be necessary, and others have 165 suggested this in the context of COVID-19 for lung injury. 32 166 167 Many hospitals have switched their standard thromboprophylaxis dose to higher doses and 168 even treatment dose thromboprophylaxis based on local expertise. In patients where this is 169 contraindicated, it is essential that mechanical thromboprophylaxis, e.g., pneumatic 170 compression devices, are used appropriately. Post-discharge thromboprophylaxis also needs 171 to be considered on an individual basis taking into account the risk of bleeding and packaged 172 with patient education and appropriate follow up. It is paramount that the outcomes of these 173 experiences are disseminated to help guide clinical judgment. 174 Conclusions 178 COVID-19 patients are at increased risk of thrombosis due to many reasons, including 179 inflammation, immobility, and other factors that contribute to a hypercoagulable state. It is 180 vital to ensure early risk stratification is carried out, and adequate thromboprophylaxis or 181 anticoagulation is administered to patients.

For upper limb involvement, the authors proposed continuous 47 positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilators can often be tied in a way that compresses the 48 superficial or deep vessels of the upper limbs leading to increased risk of DVT. Zhou et al. 49 reported a case where concomitant lower limb venous and arterial thrombosis developed in a 50 COVID-19 patient on the third day of admission. 11 This illustrates the aggressive thrombotic 51The padua prediction score (PPS) takes into consideration multiple factors, as seen inTable I54 and can be used to assess patients for VTE. 12 Low risk of VTE is defined as a score of < 4 55 and a score \u2265 4 makes thromboprophylaxis necessary. In a study including 138 patients, Xu et 56 al. found 23 (16.67%) COVID-19 patients to be at high risk for VTE according to PPS. 13 A 57 study by Cui et al. with 81 patients identified 20 (25%) patients to have developed VTE, of 58 whom 8 died. 14 VTE is a risk in COVID-19 patients and may go unnoticed in critical care 59 settings. Early use of scoring systems and risk stratification is paramount in this unique 60 Studies have reported cases of PE in patients with COVID-19. Concomitant PE with COVID-63 19 should be considered as a possibility by clinicians. It requires appropriate management as 64 it may have a profound impact on prognosis. Casey et al. present a case of PE in a low-risk 65 COVID-19 patient with no travel history or co-morbidities, suggesting the disease process 66 itself was responsible for PE. 15 Xie et al. present two cases from Wuhan of patients who 67 developed PE during their hospital stay and showed respiratory deterioration and raised D-dimer levels. 16 From these case studies, it is evident that PE in the context of COVID-19 is 69 complex and can present with no other risk factors. Furthermore, this is complicated due to 70 the overlap with other respiratory symptoms and adds another layer of diagnostic challenge. 71 72 A study evaluating outcomes of 183 patients showed 71.4% of non-survivors met the criteria 73 for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 17 In DIC, there can be a simultaneous 74 derangement of hemostasis and hypercoagulability, resulting in abnormal coagulation 75",

Obi et al. 122observed during the H1N1 pandemic those with ARDS were at increased risk of VTE. They 123 found that those without anticoagulation were 33 times more likely to develop any VTE than 124 those who were treated with empirical systemic IV heparin anticoagulation (aiming for a 125 target partial thromboplastin time of 50-70 seconds). 3 Therefore, a similar approach may be 126 necessary for COVID-19 patients to prevent these complications from occurring. 127Managing thrombosis in the context of COVID-19 has its own set of novel challenges, 129 including patients with other comorbidities such as Atrial Fibrillation (AF).

The University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom has developed a list 131 of drug interactions with experimental COVID-19 therapies and suggest that some should not 132 be co-administered with anti-virals such as Lopinavir and Ritonavir.
