Likewise, the supply chains of companies have wrought disasters on society and the ecosystem. And, more often, problems in one link of the supply chain have caused unmitigated disaster to another link, resulting in large financial and non-financial damage. Indeed, as supply chains have grown globally with companies from the west as well as those from emerging economies seeking new markets and low-cost sources worldwide, natural, man-made or even self-inflicted disasters disrupt these far-flung supply chains of today much more so than they did in the distant past.",

Supply problems caused the delay of the Sony PlayStation 3 (2006) resulting in Sony not only losing revenues but also long-term market share. Dell had to recall 4 million laptop computer batteries made by Sony owing to some problems with the batteries. In 2001, mobile-phone manufacturer Ericsson lost 400 million Euros after their supplier's semiconductor plant caught on fire upon being hit by lightning; eventually, Ericsson ceded the mobile-phone business to a new entity, Sony Ericsson. A supplier's insolvency resulted in UK auto-maker Land Rover having to lay off 1400 workers.

There may be delayed supplier deliveries or delayed product launches. Losses could result from customer dissatisfaction caused by late delivery or otherwise less-than-perfect order fulfilment in an environment increasing supplier lead times. There could be quality problems, whether or not serious enough to require recalls, in the face of shortening product lifecycles and increasing customization. Thus, the supply chain's ability to match supply to demand comes under threat with possibly disastrous consequences for the company as small losses accumulate over time despite the absence of any highly visible disaster.",

In a 2004 study, Computer Sciences Corporation found 60% of the firms in their sample reporting that their supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions. At the same time, according to two independent studies, one by the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (www.cred.be) and the other by the world's largest re-insurer Munich Re (www.munichre.com), historical data indicates that the total number of natural and man-made disasters has risen dramatically in the new millennium. Moreover, Munich Re has reported that the average cost of disasters has increased by a factor of 10 since the 1960s. Based on anecdotal observations, disruptions can also leave supply chains damaged for a long time. For example, out of the 350 businesses operating in the World Trade Center before the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, 150 were out of business a year later (Eskew, 2004). Indeed, these disruptions can have a negative impact in the long-term on a firm's market value and strategic performance measures. Hendricks and Singhal (2005a) found that companies suffering from supply chain disruptions experienced 33-40% lower stock returns relative to their industry benchmarks over a 3-year time period that starts one year before and ends 2 years after the disruption announcement date, based on a sample of 827 disruption announcements made over a 10-year period.",

This motivated Repenning and Sterman (2001) to conduct over a dozen of in-depth case studies in industries including automobiles, chemicals, oil, and semiconductors.

Specifically, HP first manufactures and ships generic printers to the distribution centers in different regions. These generic printers are then customized for different country-specific markets at each distribution center. The generic printers are produced according to a make-to-stock system, while the country-specific printers are customized in a make-to-order manner.

The fourth one applies to actions taken during and after the occurrence of an incident -the focus here is on time, which is also called time-based risk management (Chapter 5); of course, the planning of such actions can and should take place before risk events occur. In addition, we discuss how global companies mitigate risk (Chapter 6) with a focus on Samsung Electronics.",
