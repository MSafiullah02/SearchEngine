Abstract Background: Respiratory viral infection causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. We previously reported increased bronchial mucosa eosinophil and neutrophil inflammation in COPD experiencing naturally occurring exacerbations. But it is unclear whether virus per se induces bronchial mucosal inflammation, nor whether this relates to exacerbation severity. Objectives: To determine the extent and nature of bronchial mucosal inflammation following experimental rhinovirus (RV)-16-induced COPD exacerbations and its relationship to disease severity. Methods: Bronchial mucosal inflammatory cell phenotypes were determined at pre-infection baseline and following experimental RV infection in 17 GOLD stage II COPD subjects and as controls, 20 smokers and 11 non-smokers, with normal lung function. No subject had a history of asthma/allergic rhinitis: all were negative for aero-allergen skin prick tests. Results: RV-infection increased the numbers of bronchial mucosal eosinophils and neutrophils only in COPD and CD8 + T-lymphocytes in COPD and non-smokers. Monocytes/macrophages, CD4 + T-and CD20 + B-lymphocytes were increased in all subjects. At baseline, compared to non-smokers, COPD subjects and smokers had increased numbers of bronchial mucosal monocytes/macrophages and CD8 + T-lymphocytes but fewer numbers of CD4 + T-and CD20 + B-lymphocytes. The virus-induced inflammatory cells in COPD were positively associated with virus load, illness severity and reductions in lung function. Conclusion: Experimental rhinovirus infection induces bronchial mucosal eosinophilia and neutrophilia only in COPD and monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in both COPD and control subjects. The virus-induced inflammatory cell phenotypes observed in COPD positively related to virus load, illness severity. Anti-viral/anti-inflammatory therapies could attenuate bronchial inflammation and ameliorate virus-induced COPD exacerbations. (250 words)",

            "text": "Exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. 1 Respiratory viral infections are the major cause of acute exacerbations, 2 with human rhinoviruses (RV) the most common viruses detected. 3 Our own previously reported studies have shown that experimental RV-infection in subjects with COPD induces lower respiratory tract symptoms, airflow obstruction, and systemic and airway inflammation that are greater and more prolonged compared with smoking control subjects without airway obstruction, indicating a causal relationship between RV-infection and COPD exacerbations. 4 COPD in its stable phase is characterised by airway inflammation that is central to the pathogenesis of the disease 5 with increased numbers of airway mucosal monocytes/macrophages, CD4 + and CD8 + T and B lymphocytes and neutrophils that are associated with the severity of airflow limitation. 6 7-10 Neutrophilic inflammation has been a classical hallmark of both stable COPD 8, 11 and naturally occurring COPD exacerbations. 12, 13 Eosinophilic inflammation, whilst usually considered a characteristic feature of asthma, is also present in a subset of COPD patients both when stable and during exacerbations. [13] [14] [15] Increased numbers of mucosal eosinophils have been detected in bronchial biopsies from chronic bronchitis and COPD subjects experiencing naturally occurring exacerbations. [16] [17] [18] However, the role of eosinophils in COPD exacerbations, particularly in respiratory virus-induced exacerbations remains unclear. It is unknown whether virus infection per se can cause mucosal eosinophilia and neutrophilia during COPD exacerbations. Also there have been a number of confounding factors in some of the aforementioned studies, such as inclusion of mechanically ventilated patients who had received oral corticosteroids prior to sampling, 18 and use of different patient groups for comparison of stable versus exacerbated states. [16] [17] [18] We have developed an experimental model of a COPD exacerbation using human RV-16 infection in non-intubated, treatment-na\u00efve COPD patients. As part of two completed studies using this model 4, 19 bronchial biopsies were collected from COPD patients, non-COPD smokers 4, 19 and non-smokers. 19 at baseline prior to infection and on day 7 during the acute infection. These samples provide a unique opportunity to explore the bronchial mucosal inflammatory response and its physiological and clinical significance in virus-induced experimental COPD exacerbations, and to investigate whether these responses differ between COPD patients and non-COPD subjects.",

            "text": "The presence and role of eosinophils in COPD exacerbations have remained unclear with conflicting results from studies using sputum. Some studies have reported increased numbers of eosinophils at exacerbation but did not include virus detection. 20 14 We reported increased sputum eosinophils restricted to virus-induced severe exacerbations. 13 Other found no significant increase in eosinophil numbers in virus-induced exacerbations. 22 These discrepancies may be due to heterogeneity in the aetiology of COPD exacerbations, 23 timing of sampling, effects of treatment and variation of disease severity. 24 Studies using bronchial biopsies have reported increased eosinophils in the bronchial mucosa of naturally occurring exacerbations 16, 18, 25 but the role of viruses as a cause of such mucosal eosinophilia remains uncertain. Our present study is the first to compare the effects of experimentally administered virus on the bronchial mucosal inflammatory response using bronchial biopsies from the same subjects when stable and during exacerbations in treatment-na\u00efve, non-intubated COPD subjects. A significant increase in mucosal, but not sputum, eosinophils was demonstrated only in the COPD subjects following RV infection. Also, the change in sub-eosinophil counts (not for other cell types) from baseline to day 7 infection in COPD subjects, was significantly greater than those in non-smoker and smoker control subjects. This demonstrated a clear difference in the mucosal inflammatory response between COPD and non-COPD subjects. Moreover, greater numbers of sub-eosinophils were associated with greater virus load, more symptoms, bigger falls in lung function and higher sputum inflammatory markers. The findings of RV-induced eosinophilia are noteworthy given that they were observed in subjects with relatively mild COPD who had no history of asthma or allergic rhinitis and who tested negative to ten aeroallergens on skin prick tests. The data support a pathogenic role for bronchial mucosal eosinophilia in RV infection-induced COPD exacerbations. Therefore, in exacerbations of COPD where eosinophils are identified and steroid 26 or anti-IL-5 eosinophil-targeting 27, 28 therapies are considered, the addition of future novel anti-viral therapies may be of particular benefit. In addition, blood eosinophils have been examined as a marker to guide corticosteroid use in COPD exacerbations, 29, 30 though this approach continues to be debated. 31, 32 Our data suggest that the relationship between blood, sputum and mucosal eosinophils is complex. The lack of a relationship between blood and mucosal eosinophils implies that using blood eosinophils alone as a marker of airway mucosal eosinophilia may result in some patients without blood eosinophilia not receiving corticosteroids when there is, indeed, mucosal eosinophilia.",

We have also reported previously that neutrophils are significantly increased in the sputum of these COPD subjects 4, 19 with strong correlations between sputum neutrophils and sputum neutrophil elastase, IL-1\u03b2, TNF, CXCL8/IL-8, pentraxin-3 and LL-37. 19, 33 Surprisingly, in our present analyses, these sputum markers correlated better with sub-eosinophils than with epi/sub-neutrophils. These data suggest that virus infection induces an innate inflammatory response involving mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF and CXCL8/IL-8 that contribute to recruitment of both neutrophils and eosinophils. It is considered that neutrophils transit rapidly from blood through the bronchial mucosal into the airway lumen and thus their numbers in sputum reflect mucosal tissue neutrophilic inflammation. By contrast, it is likely that eosinophils transit more slowly and are retained in the mucosal compartment. Thus, we speculate that, the contribution of eosinophils may well be underestimated in studies using sputum alone. Moreover, therapies targeting eosinophils have focussed on the Th 2 pathway in both asthma 34, 35 and COPD. 27, 28 In distinction to asthma, our present data in COPD show associations between eosinophils and mediators of innate inflammation suggesting that other pathways may be involved in eosinophil recruitment to the airways, at least in the context of acute viral infection.",

In addition, for the first time, we present data showing that CD8 + T cells are increased in non-smokers and those with COPD from baseline following infection but not in the smokers who had significantly higher baseline CD8 + counts compared to non-smokers at baseline. In contrast, RV-infection induced increases of CD68 + cells in all three groups. The numbers of CD8 + cells were significantly greater in smoker and COPD groups than in the non-smoker group on day 7 post-infection, respectively.

Therefore, the roles of smoking and virus infection in CD4 + and CD20 + cells recruitment into the bronchial mucosa remain unclear. Herein, we report for the first time that both smoker and COPD subjects have lower numbers of baseline sub-CD4 + and CD20 + cells compared with non-smokers at baseline whereas RV-infection recruited CD4 + and CD20 + cells into bronchial mucosa in all three groups. These findings indicate that smoking per se increases CD68 + and CD8 + cells and decreases CD4 + and CD20 + cells, whereas RV infection increases recruitment of all these cell types in the bronchial mucosa of all subjects. Finally, we consider the reduction in the number of sub-mast cells is likely due to infection-induced degranulation, leading to fewer cells containing sufficient tryptase to stain positive for the purpose of their identification. The effects of smoking and virus infection on mast cell biology in COPD exacerbations requires further study.",

Furthermore, this is an exploratory and hypothesis-generating study and as such we did not control for type I errors arising from multiple comparisons. As a result, the observed significant differences and associations may be subject to false positives. Further hypothesis-testing studies are needed to confirm selected of our observations. However, the relative homogeneity of subjects allowed for more reliable interpretation of the data, which is difficult to obtain in naturally occurring exacerbations of COPD.",

The eosinophilic inflammatory response to RV infection in the bronchial mucosa of COPD differs from that seen in the airway lumen and in blood. The increased numbers of inflammatory cells in COPD correlated with virus load and illness severity and eosinophils also associated with sputum innate inflammatory mediators during the infection. In addition, chronic cigarette smoking decreased the numbers of CD4 + and CD20 + cells and increased CD8 + and CD68 + cells. Thus, our findings provide new insights into previously undescribed patterns of inflammatory response that occur during experimental RV-induced exacerbations of COPD and, also smoking per se: these data could impact on the design of future treatment modalities. post-infection; between counts of E, epi-and F, sub-neutrophils on day 7 and pre-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted at day 9 (Spearman rank correlation, n = 17 or 9).

The protocols for the two studies were identical. A total of 31 subjects with COPD, 28 smokers, and 19 non-smokers, were inoculated with low-dose rhinovirus 16 and 77 of 78 subjects completed the study; one subject with COPD withdrew because of ill health believed unconnected to the study. 1 Rhinovirus (RV) infection was confirmed in 20 of 30 subjects with COPD (66.7%); 22 of 28 smokers (78.6%); and 11 of 19 non-smokers (58%). [1] [2] [3] Only infected subjects were included in the present biopsy study. The bronchial biopsies were not obtained from one COPD and one healthy smoker. Two day 7 biopsies obtained from two COPD subjects and one day 7 biopsies from a smoker were of inadequate quality and excluded. Thus, actual 17 COPD, 20 healthy smokers and 11 healthy non-smokers (48 pairs of baseline and day 7 bronchial biopsies) were analysed.",

The spirometry data were collected at baseline and on days 5, 9, 12, 15, 21, 28, 35 and 42 post-infection. Peripheral blood eosinophils were counted at baseline and on day 7 after infection and in the Haematology Laboratories of St. Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. The ELISAs for detection of antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory mediators in sputum were carried out according to the manufacturers' instructions and have been published previously. 1, 2 Briefly, plates were read on a Spectramax Plus 384 plate reader and the results read using SoftMax Pro software. Initial experiments were carried out to determine whether sample dilution was required. Experiments were carried out to determine the recovery of antimicrobial peptides from sputum. A sputum sample and PBS were spiked with the relevant protein at the same concentration and the levels detected compared. For all the proteins measured the recovery in sputum was >80% that of the PBS sample. The sensitivities and sources of the individual ELISAs were as follows: pentraxin 3 (0\u00b7025ng/mL) (R&D Systems, Abingdon UK); HBD-2 (8pg/mL) (PeproTech, London UK); \u03b1-defensins 1-3 (156pg/mL) (Hycult Biotech, Cambridge UK); cathelicidin LL-37 .12ng/mL)(Immunodiagnostik, Benshein, Germany). The mediators eotaxin, eotaxin-3, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5\uff0cCXCL8/IL-8, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF in sputum were measured using the Mesoscale Discovery\u00ae platform. The technique enables quantitative detection of between 1 and 9 mediators per well in a 96 well plate format using a Multi-spot\u00ae technique which has been published previously. 3 Briefly, the protocol requires addition of 25\u03bcL blocking solution before incubation. Following plate washing either sample or standard was added to the plate, followed by incubation and washing and addition of detection antibody. Finally read buffer was added and the plate passed through the Sector imager for reading. The lower limits of detection of the individual analyse were as follows: Eotaxin (10pg/ml) \uff0c Eotaxin 3 (80pg/ml) \uff0c IL-4 (0.1pg/ml) \uff0c IL-5 (0.3pg/ml) \uff0c CXCL8/IL-8 (0.6pg/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (1.17pg/ml) and TNF (0.376pg/ml). 3 Immunohistochemistry (IHC): EnVision-alkaline phosphatase technique (Dako Ltd,Cambridge, UK) was used to label EG2 + eosinophils, neutrophil elastase + neutrophils, tryptase + mast cells and CD68 + monocytes/macrophages. EnVision peroxidase staining method (Dako) was used to identify CD4 + , CD8 + T-and CD20 + B-lymphocytes.The immunostaining procedures for detecting the phenotypes of inflammatory cells were conducted by Techmate 'Horizon' automated immunostainer (LJL Biosystems",
