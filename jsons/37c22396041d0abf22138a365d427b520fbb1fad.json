This geographical outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has had a significant impact on the economic, social, and political conditions in various countries which have changed their interactions. Meanwhile, different countries have adopted various restriction procedures (such as closing land, sea and air borders, restricting of international air traffic, etc.) to reduce the infectious effect of COVID-19. However, the COVID-19 outbreak has been very rapid and widespread. Although countries around the world have taken various precautions against the corona disease, it has been rather evident that travel restrictions such as reduction in the trip volume, transit control in the main routes at different levels (e.g., within the towns, intercities, inter-provincial regions and the entire country) is the most important approach to limit this contagious disease [3] . Experiences from different countries have indicated that intercity travelling management can help reduce corona emissions. An understanding of the COVID-19 spreading status in cities can be used for pattern analysis, crisis management, medical services, supply of pharmaceutical-food materials, and specialised forces transportations, etc. Such actions can significantly lead to cost reduction for countries.",

Clustering can be formulated as a multiobjective optimiser to conduct knowledge discovery of events pattern that is based on an iterative process [8] . As far as GIS mapping [9] is concerned, the main task is to design a visual view based on interactive queries, spatial information analyses and present the results of the operations in the form of a COVID-19 spread pattern map. The partnership of these two approaches enables the utilisation of an effective spatiotemporal distribution tool through provincial-level infection pattern developments in Iran. Fig. 1 , the corona-virus prevalence in Iran for the number 3, 4 and 5 clusters are organised as high-risk, low-risk and moderate risk, respectively, where cluster '0' indicates the low infection risk and cluster '5' indicates high infection risk during February 19 to March 22, 2020. For example in the 3 clustering tables, between February 19 to 26, 2020, the related cluster '0' is low and cluster '3' is high infection risk. Also, in the 5 clustering tables, between February 19 to March 22, 2020, the related cluster '0' is low and cluster '5' is high infection risk in different cities of Iran. Regarding these epidemiological scenarios, it can be inferred that travelling is one of the most effective factors for COVID-19 outbreak in Iran (However, it should be noted that various factors are involved that have caused the complexity of the spread). Fig. 2 presents a Euclidean distance dendrogram after infection clustering and scaling which indicates that there are three widespread infection waves in the country between the cities, and the role of the Tehran city in this prevalence is very significant. Fig. 2 has identified 3 categories for the infection which are shown with as 'blue', 'red' and 'green' colours which shows the cities that might have affected each other after the COVID-19 infection. Fig.  3 illustrates the kernel density estimation (KDE) nonparametric probability density function results that were implemented for the corona disease prevalence in Iran based on spatiotemporal distribution and infection development during the February 19 to March 22, 2020 time period. According to the results of presented by Fig. 3 , the Tehran, Qom and Alborz provinces are located within the crisis areas of the country.",
