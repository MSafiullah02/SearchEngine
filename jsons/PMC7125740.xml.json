            "text": "Overlay networks are recognized as a way of improving Internet services in many fields, most of which only related to one-dimensional data (Hu et al., 2008, Tanin et al., 2007, Jelasity et al., 2009). With the increase in demand for online services of spatial information, the challenges of fast indexing in distributed networks has become a hot research topic in the combined field of Computer Science and Geographic Information Science. The indexing information involves multi-dimensional data, the corresponding online services of which are becoming increasingly more complicated, especially in that they require complex spatial extent data (e.g. BBox, Bounding Box) with a massive number of concurrent users through network browser. For example, there exist a massive number of concurrent queries for spatial extent data about the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in the spring of 2003. The GIS (Geographic Information Systems) based on browser/server (Gogu et al., 2006) cannot efficiently support these large-scale spatial information queries and indexing since the central GIS server unavoidably suffers with hotspot bottleneck and single point of failure (Wu et al., 2010). Here term large-scale means the number of concurrent users is very large, maybe up to thousands or even millions. There exists a contradiction between hotspot bottleneck of GIS server and a massive number of concurrent users for spatial information queries. This scientific problem has not yet been solved completely. Therefore, various new methods have been investigated to address this problem.",

            "text": "Regarding spatial data network processing, Tanin et al., 2006, Tanin et al., 2007 presented their preliminary work, DQTChord, which is the work most closely related to our study. In this paper, we compare our approach with DQTChord, in which the spatial data is first divided based on Distributed Quad-Tree, and then mapped onto a Chord. Our approach differs from theirs in that we use a hybrid structure for the overlay network, which includes two layers and considers semantic information. Peers with similar semantics in our semantic overlay network are organized into same peer clusters, which make sharing information among peers more efficiently. The benefits of our approach include a decreased indexing load and increased indexing efficiency. Other related works include (Hu et al., 2008), which uses the P2P framework FLoD to 3D scene streaming for virtual globe applications, and Kantere et al., 2009, which use SPATIALP2P, a totally decentralized framework for spatial data built on top of a one-dimensional DHT. In (Zhang et al., 2009) a swift tree structure for multidimensional data indexing is proposed, which has a query efficiency of O(logN) in terms of routing hops and an low maintenance cost. Our spatial information indexing is substantially different. It is based on a semantic overlay network with a multi-layer structure.",

An algorithm for the distributed and decentralized construction of hierarchical SONs in unstructured P2P networks is presented by Doulkeridis et al. (2007), which is a distributed method of clustering content in a recursive way. Tirado et al. (2010) proposed an affinity AP2P, which is similar to our approach. It uses a novel affinity-based metric to estimate the distance between clusters of nodes sharing similar content. However, there are two main differences from AP2P. First, we define the different semantic similarity function for spatial information. Second, we introduce the epidemic protocol for overlay construction.",

This network is connected by logical links between peers in a semantic quad-tree topology, which is a small world network with a small average path length and a large clustering coefficient. In our semantic quad-tree, peers with similar semantics are organized into same peer clusters, which can be further adaptively arranged into a small world network. According to this semantic proximity, we can dynamically construct the topology of an overlay network in a robust, dependable manner based on our previous work, i.e., HPSIN and SDI-CDQT (Wu et al., 2010, Zou et al., 2011). In (Wu et al., 2010) a HPSIN was proposed by us, which combines distributed quad-tree with distributed hash table (DHT) to maintain both query efficiency and system load balance. Based on our HPSIN, we further propose a SDI-CDQT extending the quad-tree layer in HPSIN by semantic clustering strategy (Zou et al., 2011), which makes the peers with similar interesting belong to the same cluster. However, there exist insufficiencies under a massive number of concurrent users indexing since both HPSIN and SDI-CDQT did not effectively consider the construction of overlay network for large-scale spatial information indexing. To our best knowledge, there lacks effective fast construction protocol of overlay network and the corresponding theoretical analysis for spatial information indexing.",

First, we place the head peer of the semantic cluster into the Chord ring layer according to the semantics of spatial information that peer holds. And then, in semantic quad-tree, we let each head peer maintain a cluster of four neighboring peers based on a uniform k-element Semantic Vector (SV) where k is some constant. The two main aspects of the semantic space correspond to two sub-SVs, SV\n1 and SV\n2. SV={SV\n1, SV\n2}={{e11,e12,\u2026,e1k1},{e21,e22,\u2026,e2k2}}, k\n1\n+k\n2\n=k. Note that Semantic Vector corresponds to a point in the semantic space while the word \u201csemantic\u201d here means that the element in SV and the point in the semantic space both contain some concrete feature or attribute, which is represented by one element e\nij in the SV with the data object including a weight\nij. SV\n1 and SV\n2 correspond to two aspects, respectively, i.e., the semantic of spatial information that peer holds in overlay network and physical network performances, such as online time and bandwidth. For an example, if there are three peers A,B,C, peer A requests some spatial information that hold by peer B and C, and peer B and C have the same online time, peer A perhaps share data with peer B or peer C. However, if peer B have shorter online time than peer C, peer A would only create one P2P logical link with peer C and share data with peer C. One peer in a semantic overlay network can be regarded as a point in the k-dimensional semantic space. Furthermore, the proximity of two peers can be represented by the Euclidean distance between the two points in the semantic space.",

The spatial object in BBox A comprises one CP O1 at level 1 and four recursive space subdivisions A1, A2, A3, A4, respectively.
