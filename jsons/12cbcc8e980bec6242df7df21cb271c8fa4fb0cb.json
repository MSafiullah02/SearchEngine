Serological analysis was performed using a high-sensitivity ELISA developed in-house. Serological analysis was performed at biological containment level 2. High-binding plates (Greiner Bio-One) were coated with trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein [7, 8] and blocked with Stabilcoat solution (Sigma Aldrich). Serum was pre-diluted 1:40 prior to analysis. A combined secondary layer containing horse-radish peroxidase conjugated polyclonal antibodies against IgG, IgA and IgM followed by 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine development was used to detect the presence of antibodies.

In contrast to these results, we report an overall seroconversion rate of 24.4% across our cohort by 25/4/2020. This would suggest that PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swabs consistently underestimates true infection rates [11] . In light of further evidence of asymptomatic infection and seroconversion, the impact of mandatory screening of health care workers should be thoroughly investigated [12] The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies amongst the UK general population remains unknown and few studies have considered seroprevalence in other populations. In Santa Clara, California, the seroprevalence rate has been estimated at between 1.3 and 4.7%, significantly lower than that found in the health-care worker cohort described herein, but this was assessed using different diagnostic methods [13] . In the SARS-CoV epidemic, the rate of seroconversion in healthcare workers with SARS (88.9%) and in asymptomatic health care workers (1.4%) were both higher than the general population (0.4%) suggesting increased seroprevalence due to occupational risk. This also indicates that, even after exposure to this far more lethal virus, seroconversion can occur without any accompanying symptomatology. In our cohort, the relationship between prior symptomatic illness and seroconversion closely followed the temporal epidemiology of the pandemic across the UK and at UHBFT. We cannot exclude the possibility this study underestimates SARS-CoV-2 infections in health care workers by failing to capture more recent infections that had not led to seroconversion by 25th April. Longitudinal studies involving serial sampling will be necessary to provide up-dated assessments of seroconversion and the longevity of antibody responses.",
