The collection of related data15, 16 includes the variability of activities, associated infection risks, and the importance of clarifying expectations of compliance. A data collection tool was required to provide credible information relating to a range of infection prevention practices, reflecting the operational risks and constraints encountered in different clinical settings and generating data of value for practice improvement. The aim of this work was to develop and implement an infection control performance and quality improvement data collection tool to meet the needs of a large, acute health care provider and to improve the credibility and use of infection control performance monitoring.",

Factors impeding compliance, such as empty soap dispensers or ambiguity of expectations, were not resolved when observed as they should have been. Other issues reported by staff were inconsistent feedback about performance, inadequate facilities, dissatisfaction with products and supplies, lack of appropriate knowledge, ambiguity related to definitions, expectations and standards, and difficulty in observing single rooms without causing disruption. Infection control risks varied across the organization and specialties. Misconceptions such as when to wear disposable gloves were not managed or monitored, and there was a focus on identifying failures in compliance, whereas good practice was unrecognized. Some staff, including medical staff, were largely disengaged from the process of monitoring and improving infection control practice.",
