While the genomes of DNA viruses and bacteria may serve to directly activate cGAS, damage to the mitochondria during infection with RNA viruses can also trigger cGAS activation through exposure of mitochondrial DNA [11] . Therefore, pathogens from divergent groups encode proteins targeting cGAS, 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP, and STING to disrupt signaling. Despite the great diversity of these pathogens and the effectors they employ to restrict cGAS-STING activation, shared strategies can be identified which allow escape from the innate immune response (Figure 1 ).",

In particular, formation of higher-order phase-separated droplets has emerged as a checkpoint for regulating cGAS activation [12 ] , new structures of STING in complex with TBK1 have provided a mechanism for assembly of the STING signalosome and activation of downstream signaling [13 ,14 ] , and extracellular 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP signaling has emerged as an entirely new facet of cGAS-STING biology [15, 16] . While other recent reviews provide in-depth analysis of these new discoveries [17, 18] , here we focus on conserved strategies utilized by different pathogens for evasion of cGAS-STING immunity. Study of these strategies has provided important insight into cellular regulation of cGAS-STING signaling, and likewise these pathogen immune escape factors will continue to serve as useful tools to gain mechanistic insight into pathway function and regulation. In turn, our deepening understanding of the cGAS-STING pathway creates new questions regarding the mechanisms of different groups of viral and bacterial factors which inhibit signaling and indicates new strategies which may be exploited by pathogens for immune evasion.",

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) VP22 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL83 are both tegument proteins which bind cGAS and block downstream signaling [23, 24] . Another member of the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also encodes a tegument protein that inhibits cGAS, ORF52 (also named KicGAS) [25] . ORF52 blocks cGAS activation through a mechanism which requires both cGAS and DNA binding by ORF52. While these proteins from diverse herpesviruses seemingly vary in their requirement for DNA binding activity, they share striking Summary of the cGAS-STING pathway and potential pathogen evasion strategies. Recognition of cytosolic double-stranded DNA triggers assembly of cGAS into DNA ladder structures, and liquid droplets. Oligomerization into a minimal 2:2 cGAS:DNA complex is required for activation to produce the second messenger 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP from ATP and GTP. 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP is subsequently recognized by STING which oligomerizes to form a signalosome complex and traffics to the ERGIC and perinuclear regions. This leads to recruitment of the downstream kinase TBK1 to promote innate immune signaling. Points in the pathway which are known (checked box) or potential (red open box) pathogen targets for restriction of cGAS-STING signaling are summarized on the right in the viral escape checklist.",

Poxin is highly specific for host 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP, and deletion of poxin from the viral genome resulted in attenuation of VACV in a mouse model of infection. Functional poxin enzymes are also found in the genomes of insect viruses in the family Baculoviridae, and moths and butterflies, which serve as hosts to these viruses [33 ] . The emerging role for cGAS-STING signaling in insects is likely to enable discovery of additional insect pathogen inhibitors of pathway activation [40] [41] [42] . In mammals, no cytosolic enzymes have been discovered which degrade 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP, but instead the extracellular enzyme ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 1 (ENPP1) has been shown to be the major source of 2 0 3 0 -cGAMPdegrading activity in mammalian tissue and plasma [43] . Interestingly, avian poxviruses lack a homolog of poxin, but do encode a predicted homolog of ENPP1, indicating these viruses may have obtained alternative means of degrading 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP during infection [44] . Together, these results indicate that 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP degradation is a more widespread mechanism for control of innate immune signaling than previously understood.",

It remains unclear how these different processes may regulate one another, but interestingly, a number of pathogen factors interfere with one or more steps. Two RNA virus factors, Hepatitis C virus NS4B, and the coronavirus HCoV-NL63 papain-like protease (PL-pro) both interfere with STING oligomerization [55, 56] . Interestingly, it is the deubiquitinase activity rather than the protease activity of PL-pro that is required for antagonism of STING oligomer formation [56] . Several other pathogen factors have been discovered which appear to interfere specifically with STING ubiquitination, including the human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 Tax protein [57] , and Yersinia YopJ protein, which also functions as a deubiquitinase [58] . YopJ is additionally reported to block STING ER to ERGIC trafficking, perhaps implying a connection between these processes [58] . Several viral proteins directly target STING trafficking to the ERGIC, which requires the iRhom2/TRAPb complex [54] . The HCMV tegument protein UL82 disrupts the complex between STING, iRhom2 and TRAPb [59] . Similarly, HCMV UL42, along with its role in antagonizing cGAS oligomerization, is reported to stimulate degradation of TRAPb in order to block STING trafficking [27] . Last, the bacterium Shigella flexneri encodes IpaJ which inhibits STING trafficking by an indirect mechanism, targeting ARF GTPases to block traffic out of the ER [60] .",

The KSHV vIRF1 protein blocks this process, preventing association of TBK1 [62] . Mareck's disease virus is an avian oncogenic herpesvirus, and its oncoprotein Meq functions in a similar way, blocking recruitment of TBK1 to STING in chicken cells [63 ] .

Given that virion stability and efficiency of viral DNA packaging may influence cytosolic DNA sensing during infection, further work to establish the exact mechanisms by which these proteins antagonize cGAS-STING signaling will provide important insight to help unite our understanding of their structural and immune antagonist roles.",
