They range from mild upper respiratory tract problems to serious lower respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Viruses are the main pathogens and they account for many emergency hospital admissions [1], [2]. Clinical signs and symptoms overlap between different viruses, but also between viruses and bacteria, making etiological diagnosis based on clinical presentation alone difficult and sometimes leading to overuse of antibiotics.",

The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification technology (MPLA)-RespiFinder\u00ae Respiratory assay [3] recently became commercially available.
