Since its outbreak in December 2019, COVID-19 has posed a great threat to human health and life in China and the world (2) . Nucleic acid testing is the gold standard method for confirming infection (3) . Many real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR kits have been developed and used by the World Health Organization, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and private companies. However, in China, false-negative results have been reported at rates as high as 20 to 40 percent in cases for which both clinical symptoms and imaging evidence raised strong suspicions of disease (4) . False negatives may be caused by various factors, including the specimen source, timing of sampling, personnel operation, and the test kit quality.",

To cope with the COVID-19 epidemic, the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved six RT-PCR kits for SARS-CoV-2, and some of which subsequently received CE marking. However, because the research and development time was short, the approved kits were not verified or optimized with appropriate numbers of clinical samples, which may have affected their LoDs. To examine whether LoD is a factor contributing to the observed false-negative results, we evaluated and compared the LoDs of these six kits using real viral RNA. Viral RNA was extracted from cultured SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/ZJU-01/Human/2020) with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). To verify its applicability, the viral RNA was tested with the six kits provided by Shanghai Liferiver Bio-tech Co., Ltd, Wuhan Huada Bio-tech Co., Ltd, Shanghai GeneoDx Biotech Co., Ltd, DAAN Gene Co., Ltd of Sun Yat-sen University, Sansure Biotech Inc., and Shanghai BioGerm Medical Co., Ltd. The different target genes ( Table   1 ) produced typical S-shaped amplification curves, indicating that the RNA could be used in the six kits to evaluate their LoDs.",

The poor LoD of the latter may be attributable to technical deficiencies in the product's manufacture, including unreasonable primer design, primer or probe impurities, reagent instability, or inappropriate reagent ratios.

The average concentrations of ORF1ab, N gene, and E gene were 4.16 \u00d7 10 5 , 5.33 \u00d7 10 5 , and 5.04 \u00d7 10 5 copies/mL respectively, so the average concentration of viral RNA was 4.84 \u00d7 10 5 copies/mL. The serially two-fold diluted viral RNA was detected 20 times for each concentration.Following guidelines in the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document EP17-A, the lowest concentration level with a detection rate of 95% for positive results was taken as the LoD for each kit. The LoDs of four of the kits were 484 copies/mL, whereas the LoD of BioGerm was 968 copies/mL and the LoD of GeneoDx was only 7744 copies/mL, giving a maximum 16-fold difference (",

Our results show that the LoDs of the six commercial kits approved by NMPA differ substantially, with the poorest LODs likely leading to false-negative results when RT-PCR is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Manufacturers should analyze the existing problems according to the clinical application and further improve their products. Laboratories should verify and 4 compare the performances between kits from different manufacturers and different batches before their routine use. Such measures should reduce the clinical risks associated with false-negative results and more effectively control the spread of COVID-19 throughout the world.",
