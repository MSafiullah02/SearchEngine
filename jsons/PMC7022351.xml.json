            "text": "Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) occurs when antibodies facilitate viral entry into host cells and enhance viral infection in these cells (1, 2). ADE has been observed for a variety of viruses, most notably flaviviruses (e.g., dengue virus) (3\u20136). It has been shown that when patients are infected by one serotype of dengue virus (i.e., primary infection), they produce neutralizing antibodies targeting the same serotype of the virus. However, if they are later infected by another serotype of dengue virus (i.e., secondary infection), the preexisting antibodies cannot fully neutralize the virus. Instead, the antibodies first bind to the virus and then bind to the IgG Fc receptors on immune cells and mediate viral entry into these cells. A similar mechanism has been observed for HIV and Ebola viruses (7\u201310). Thus, subneutralizing antibodies (or nonneutralizing antibodies in some cases) are responsible for ADE of these viruses. Given the critical roles of antibodies in host immunity, ADE causes serious concerns in epidemiology, vaccine design, and antibody-based drug therapy. This study reveals a novel mechanism for ADE in which fully neutralizing antibodies mimic the function of viral receptor in mediating viral entry into Fc receptor-expressing cells.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are a family of large, positive-stranded, and enveloped RNA viruses (11, 12). Two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), cause lethal infections in humans (13\u201316). An envelope-anchored spike protein guides coronavirus entry into host cells (17). As a homotrimer, the spike contains three receptor-binding S1 subunits and a trimeric membrane fusion S2 stalk (18\u201325). This state of the spike on the mature virions is called \u201cprefusion.\u201d SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively, as their viral receptors (26\u201328). Their S1 subunits each contain a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that mediates receptor recognition (29, 30) (Fig. 1A). The RBD is located on the tip of the spike trimer and is present in two different states: standing up and lying down (18, 21) (Fig. 1B). Binding to a viral receptor can stabilize the RBD in the standing-up state (20). Receptor binding also triggers the spike to undergo further conformational changes, allowing host proteases to cleave at two sites sequentially: first at the S1/S2 boundary (i.e., S1/S2 site) and then within S2 (i.e., S2\u2032 site) (31, 32). Proteolysis of the spike can take place during viral maturation (by proprotein convertases), after viral release (by extracellular proteases), after viral attachment (by cell surface proteases), or after viral endocytosis (by lysosomal proteases) (33\u201339). After two protease cleavages, S1 dissociates and S2 undergoes a dramatic structural change to fuse host and viral membranes; this membrane fusion state of the spike is called \u201cpostfusion\u201d (40, 41). Due to the recent progress toward understanding the receptor recognition and membrane fusion mechanisms of coronavirus spikes, coronaviruses represent an excellent model system for investigating ADE of viral entry.",

Further, one study demonstrated that unlike receptor-dependent viral entry, serum-dependent SARS-CoV entry does not go through the endosome pathway (44). Additionally, it has long been known that immunization of cats with feline coronavirus spike leads to worsened future infection due to the induction of infection-enhancing antibodies (45\u201347). However, detailed molecular mechanisms for ADE of coronavirus entry are still unknown. We previously discovered a monoclonal antibody (MAb) (named Mersmab1) which has strong binding affinity for MERS-CoV RBD and efficiently neutralizes MERS-CoV entry by outcompeting DPP4 (48); this discovery allowed us to comparatively study the molecular mechanisms for antibody-dependent and receptor-dependent viral entries.",

First, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed between Mermab1 and MERS-CoV RBD and between Mersmab1 and MERS-CoV spike ectodomain (S-e) (Fig. 2A). To this end, Mersmab1 (which was in excess) was used to coat the ELISA plate, and gradient amounts of recombinant RBD or S-e were added for detection of potential binding to Mersmab1. The results showed that both the RBD and S-e bound to Mersmab1. S-e bound to Mersmab1 more tightly than the RBD did, likely due to the multivalent effects associated with the trimeric state of S-e. Second, we prepared Fab from Mersmab1 using papain digestion and examined the binding between Fab and S-e using ELISA. Recombinant S-e (which was in excess) was used to coat the ELISA plate, and gradient amounts of Fab or Mersmab1 were added for detection of potential binding to S-e. The results showed that both Fab and Mersmab1 bound to S-e (Fig. 2B). Mersmab1 bound to S-e more tightly than Fab did, also likely due to the multivalent effects associated with the dimeric state of Mersmab1. Third, a flow cytometry assay was carried out to detect the binding between S-e and the DPP4 receptor and among S-e, Mersmab1, and CD32A (which is an Fc receptor). To this end, DPP4 or CD32A was expressed on the surface of human HEK293T cells (human kidney cells), and recombinant S-e was added for detection of potential binding to one of the two receptors in the absence or presence of Mersmab1. The results showed that without Mersmab1, S-e bound to DPP4 only; in the presence of Mersmab1, S-e bound to CD32A (Fig. 2C). As a negative control, a SARS-CoV RBD-specific MAb (49) did not mediate the binding of S-e to CD32A. The cell surface expressions of both DPP4 and CD32A were measured and used for calibrating the flow cytometry result (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that the direct binding of S-e to DPP4 is stronger than the indirect binding of S-e to CD32A through Mersmab1. Overall, these biochemical results reveal that Mersmab1 not only directly binds to the RBD region of MERS-CoV S-e but also mediates the indirect binding interactions between MERS-CoV S-e and the Fc receptor.",

To this end, we performed a MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry assay, in which retroviruses pseudotyped with MERS-CoV spike (i.e., MERS-CoV pseudoviruses) were used to enter human cells expressing CD32A on their surface. The main advantage of pseudovirus entry assay is to focus on the viral entry step (which is mediated by MERS-CoV spike) by separating viral entry from the other steps of viral infection cycles (e.g., replication, packaging, and release). We tested three different types of Fc receptors: CD16A, CD32A, and CD64A; each of these Fc receptors was exogenously expressed in HEK293T cells. We also tested macrophages in which mixtures of Fc receptors were endogenously expressed. The absence of Mersmab1 served as a control for Mersmab1 (a nonneutralizing MAb would be appropriate as another control for Mersmab1, but we do not have access to any nonneutralizing MAb). The results showed that in the absence of Mersmab1, MERS-CoV pseudoviruses could not enter Fc receptor-expressing cells; in the presence of Mersmab1, MERS-CoV pseudoviruses demonstrated significant efficiency in entering CD32A-expressing HEK293T cells and macrophages (Fig. 3A). In comparison, in the absence of Mersmab1, MERS-CoV pseudoviruses entered DPP4-expressing HEK293T cells efficiently, but the entry was blocked effectively by Mersmab1 (Fig. 3A). In control experiments, anti-SARS MAb did not mediate MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry into Fc receptor-expressing HEK293T cells or macrophages, nor did it block MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry into DPP4 receptor-expressing HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A). In another set of control experiments, we showed that neither the Fc nor the Fab portion of Mersmab1 could mediate MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry into Fc receptor-expressing HEK293T cells or macrophages (Fig. 3B), suggesting that both the Fc and Fab portions of anti-MERS MAb are required for antibody-mediated viral entry. The above-mentioned DPP4-expressing HEK293T cells were induced to exogenously express high levels of DPP4. To detect background expression levels of DPP4, we performed reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) on HEK293T cells. The result showed that HEK293T cells express very low levels of DPP4 (Fig. 3C). In comparison, MRC5 cells (human lung cells) express high levels of DPP4, whereas HeLa cells (human cervical cells) do not express DPP4 (Fig. 3C). Because of the comprehensive control experiments that we performed, the very low endogenous expression of DPP4 in HEK293T cells should not affect our conclusions. Nevertheless, we confirmed the above results using HeLa cells that do not express DPP4 (Fig. 3D). Overall, our results reveal that Mersmab1 mediates MERS-CoV entry into Fc receptor-expressing cells but blocks MERS-CoV entry into DPP4-expressing cells.",

It was shown previously that DPP4 binds to MERS-CoV spike and stabilizes the RBD in the standing-up position (Fig. 1A and B), resulting in a weakened spike structure and allowing the S2\u2032 site to become exposed to proteases (51). We repeated this experiment: MERS-CoV pseudoviruses were incubated with DPP4 and then subjected to trypsin cleavage (Fig. 4A). The results showed that during the viral packaging process, virus surface-anchored MERS-CoV spike molecules were cleaved at the S1/S2 site by proprotein convertases; in the absence of DPP4, the spike molecules could not be cleaved further at the S2\u2032 site by trypsin. These data suggest that only the S1/S2 site, and not the S2\u2032 site, was accessible to proteases in the free form of the spike trimer. In the presence of DPP4, a significant amount of MERS-CoV spike molecules were cleaved at the S2\u2032 site by trypsin, indicating that DPP4 binding triggered a conformational change of MERS-CoV spike to expose the S2\u2032 site. Interestingly, we found that Mersmab1 binding also allowed MERS-CoV spike to be cleaved at the S2\u2032 site by trypsin. As a negative control, the SARS-CoV RBD-specific MAb did not trigger MERS-CoV spike to be cleaved at the S2\u2032 site by trypsin. Hence, like DPP4, Mersmab1 triggers a conformational change of MERS-CoV spike to expose the S2\u2032 site for proteolysis.",

We previously demonstrated through mutagenesis studies that Mersmab1 binds to the same receptor-binding region on MERS-CoV RBD as DPP4 does (Fig. 1C) (48). Because full-length Mersmab1 (which is a dimer) triggered aggregation of S-e (which is a trimer), we prepared the Fab part (which is a monomer) of Mersmab1, detected the binding between Fab and S-e (Fig. 2B), and used Fab in the negative-stain EM study. The results showed that Fab bound to the tip of the S-e trimer, where the RBD is located (Fig. 4B). Due to the limited resolution of negative-stain EM, we could not clearly see the conformation of the Fab-bound RBD. However, based on previous studies, the receptor-binding site on the RBD in the spike trimer is accessible only when the RBD is in the standing-up position (18, 20, 21). Hence, the fact that the MAb binds to the receptor-binding region of the RBD in the spike trimer suggests that the RBD is in the standing-up state. Thus, the results from negative-stain EM and the proteolysis study are consistent with each other, supporting the idea that like DPP4, Mersmab1 stabilizes the RBD in the standing-up position and triggers a conformational change of the spike.

            "text": "To understand the pathways of Mersmab1-dependent MERS-CoV entry, we evaluated the potential impact of different proteases on MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry; these proteases are distributed along the viral entry pathway. First, proprotein convertase inhibitor (PPCi) was used for examining the role of proprotein convertases in the maturation of MERS-CoV spike and the impact of proprotein convertases on the ensuing Mersmab1-dependent viral entry (Fig. 5A). The results showed that when MERS-CoV pseudoviruses were produced from HEK293T cells in the presence of PPCi, the cleavage of MERS-CoV spike by proprotein convertases was significantly inhibited (Fig. 5B). In the absence of Mersmab1, MERS-CoV pseudoviruses packaged in the presence of PPCi entered DPP4-expressing human cells more efficiently than those packaged in the absence of PPCi (Fig. 5A). In the presence of Mersmab1, MERS-CoV pseudoviruses packaged in the presence of PPCi entered CD32A-expressing cells more efficiently than those packaged in the absence of PPCi (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that proprotein convertases play a role (albeit not as drastic as some other proteases; see below) in both DPP4-dependent and Mersmab1-dependent MERS-CoV entries. Second, cell surface protease TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2) was introduced to human cells for evaluation of its role in Mersmab1-dependent viral entry (Fig. 5C). The results showed that in the absence of Mersmab1, TMPRSS2 enhanced MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry into DPP4-expressing cells, consistent with previous reports (36). In the presence of Mersmab1, TMPRSS2 also enhanced MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry into CD32A-expressing cells, suggesting that TMPRSS2 activates Mersmab1-dependent MERS-CoV entry. Third, lysosomal protease inhibitors were evaluated for the role of lysosomal proteases in Mersmab1-dependent viral entry (Fig. 5D). Two inhibitors were used, lysosomal acidification inhibitor Baf-A1 and cysteine protease inhibitor E64d. The results showed that lysosomal protease inhibitors blocked the DPP4-dependent viral entry pathway, consistent with previous reports (39). Lysosomal protease inhibitors also blocked the Mersmab1-dependent viral entry pathway, suggesting that lysosomal proteases play important roles in Mersmab1-dependent MERS-CoV entry. Taken together, the DPP4-dependent and Mersmab1-dependent MERS-CoV entries can both be activated by proprotein convertases, cell surface proteases, and lysosomal proteases; hence, the same pathways are shared by DPP4-dependent and Mersmab1-dependent MERS-CoV entries.",

            "text": "To determine the range of Mersmab1 dosages in ADE, MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry was performed in the presence of different concentrations of Mersmab1. Three types of human HEK293T cells were used: HEK293T cells exogenously expressing DPP4 only, CD32A only, or both DPP4 and CD32A. Accordingly, three different sets of results were obtained. First, as the amount of Mersmab1 increased, viral entry into DPP4-expressing HEK293T cells continuously dropped (Fig. 6A). This result reveals that Mersmab1 blocks the DPP4-dependent viral entry pathway by outcompeting DPP4 for binding to MERS-CoV spike. Second, as the amount of Mersmab1 increased, viral entry into CD32A-expressing HEK293T cells first increased and then decreased (Fig. 6A). The turning point was about 100 ng/ml of Mersmab1. A likely explanation for this result is as follows: at low concentrations, more MAb molecules enhance the indirect interactions between MERS-CoV spike and the Fc receptor; at high concentrations, MAb molecules saturate the cell surface Fc receptor molecules and then further bind to MERS-CoV spike and block the indirect interactions between MERS-CoV spike and the Fc receptor. Third, as the amount of Mersmab1 increased, viral entry into cells expressing both DPP4 and CD32A first dropped, then increased, and finally dropped again (Fig. 6B). This result is the cumulative effect of the previous two results. It reveals that when both DPP4 and CD32A are present on host cell surface, Mersmab1 inhibits viral entry (by blocking the DPP4-dependent entry pathway) at low concentrations, promotes viral entry (by enhancing the CD32A-dependent entry pathway) at intermediate concentrations, and inhibits viral entry (by blocking both the DPP4- and CD32A-dependent entry pathways) at high concentrations. We further confirmed the above-described results using MRC5 cells, which are human lung cells endogenously expressing DPP4 (Fig. 6C and D). Therefore, ADE of MERS-CoV entry depends on the range of Mersmab1 dosages as well as expressions of the viral and Fc receptors on cell surfaces.",

It has also been observed in HIV and Ebola viruses (7\u201310). For these viruses, it has been proposed that primary viral infections of hosts led to production of antibodies that are subneutralizing or nonneutralizing for secondary viral infections; these antibodies cannot completely neutralize secondary viral infections but instead guide virus particles to enter Fc receptor-expressing cells. ADE can lead to worsened symptoms in secondary viral infections, causing major concerns for epidemiology. ADE is also a major concern for vaccine design and antibody-based drug therapy, since antibodies generated or used in these procedures may lead to ADE. ADE has been observed in coronaviruses for decades, but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Recent advances in understanding of the receptor recognition and cell entry mechanisms of coronaviruses have allowed us to use coronaviruses as a model system for studying ADE.",

MAb binding likely stabilizes the RBD in the standing-up position, triggers a conformational change of MERS-CoV spike, and exposes the previously inaccessible S2\u2032 site to proteases. During the preparation of the manuscript, a newly published study demonstrated that a SARS-CoV RBD-specific MAb (named S230) bound to the ACE2-binding region in SARS-CoV RBD, stabilized the RBD in the standing-up position, and triggered conformational changes of SARS-CoV spike (Fig. 7A) (52). In contrast, a MERS-CoV RBD-specific MAb (named LCA60) bound to the side of MERS-CoV RBD, away from the DPP4-binding region, stabilized the RBD in the lying-down position, and did not trigger conformational changes of MERS-CoV spike (Fig. 7B). These published results are consistent with our results regarding Mersmab1-triggered conformational changes of MERS-CoV spike, together suggesting that in order to trigger conformational changes of coronavirus spikes, MAbs need to bind to the receptor-binding region in their RBD and stabilize the RBD in the standing-up position. Moreover, our study revealed that ADE of MERS-CoV entry follows the same entry pathways as DPP4-dependent MERS-CoV entry. Specifically, proprotein convertases partially activate MERS-CoV spike. If cell surface proteases are present, MERS-CoV spike can be further activated and fuse membranes on the cell surface; otherwise, MERS-CoV enters endosomes and lysosomes, where lysosomal proteases activate MERS-CoV spike for membrane fusion. Taken together, our results show that RBD-specific neutralizing MAbs bind to the same region on coronavirus spikes as viral receptors do, trigger conformational changes of the spikes as viral receptors do, and mediate ADE through the same pathways as viral-receptor-dependent viral entry. In other words, RBD-specific neutralizing MAbs mediate ADE of coronavirus entry by functionally mimicking viral receptors.",

            "text": "Finally, we analyzed ADE of coronavirus entry at different antibody dosages. MERS-CoV entry into cells expressing both viral and Fc receptors demonstrates complex MAb-dosage-dependent patterns. As the concentration of MAb increases, (i) viral entry into DPP4-expressing cells is inhibited more efficiently because MAb binds to the spike and blocks the DPP4-dependent entry pathway, (ii) viral entry into Fc receptor-expressing cells is first enhanced and then inhibited because MAb binds to the Fc receptor to enhance the ADE pathway until the Fc receptor molecules are saturated, and (iii) viral entry into cells expressing both DPP4 and Fc receptor is first inhibited, then enhanced, and finally inhibited again because of the cumulative effects of the previous two patterns. In other words, for viral entry into cells expressing both DPP4 and Fc receptor, there exists a balance between the DPP4-dependent and antibody-dependent entry pathways that can be shifted and determined by MAb dosages. Importantly, ADE occurs only at intermediate MAb dosages. Our study explains an earlier observation that ADE of dengue viruses occurs only at certain concentrations of MAb (5). While many human tissues express either DPP4 or Fc receptor, a few of them, most notably placenta, express both of them (53, 54). For other viruses that use viral receptors different from DPP4, there may also be human tissues where the viral receptor and Fc receptor are both expressed. The expression levels of these two receptors in specific tissue cells likely are determinants of MAb dosages at which ADE would occur in these tissues. Other determinants of ADE-enabling MAb dosages may include the binding affinities of the MAb for the viral and Fc receptors. Overall, our study suggests that ADE of viruses depends on antibody dosages, tissue-specific expressions of viral and Fc receptors, and some intrinsic features of the antibody.",

As we have shown here, RBD-specific neutralizing MAbs may mediate ADE of viruses by mimicking the functions of viral receptors. Neutralizing MAbs targeting other parts of viral spikes would be less likely to mediate ADE if they do not trigger the conformational changes of the spikes. Hence, to reduce the likelihood of ADE, spike-based subunit vaccines lacking the RBD can be designed to prevent viral infections. Based on the same principle, neutralizing MAbs targeting other parts of the spike can be selected to treat viral infections. Moreover, as already discussed, our study stresses on the importance of choosing antibody dosages that do not cause ADE and points out that different tissue cells should be closely monitored for potential ADE at certain antibody dosages.",

            "text": "The in vitro systems used in this study provide a model framework for ADE. Future research using in vivo systems is needed to further confirm these results. Our previous study showed that a humanized version of Mersmab1 efficiently protected human DPP4-transgenic mice from live MERS-CoV challenges (48, 55), suggesting that given the antibody dosages used in this previous study as well as the binding affinity of the MAb for human DPP4, the receptor-dependent pathway of MERS-CoV entry dominated over ADE in vivo. Thus, future in vivo studies may need to screen for a wide range of antibody dosages and also for a variety of tissues with different ratios of DPP4 and Fc receptor expressions. Although ADE has not been observed for MERS-CoV in vivo, our study suggests that ADE occurs under some specific conditions in vivo, depending on the antibody dosages, binding affinity of the MAb for DPP4, and tissue expressions of DPP4 and Fc receptor. Moreover, the mechanism that we have identified for ADE of MERS-CoV in vitro may account for the ADE observed in vivo for other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and feline coronavirus (42\u201347). Overall, our study reveals complex roles of antibodies in viral entry and can guide future vaccine design and antibody-based drug therapy.",

Total RNA was extracted from three different cell lines: HEK293T, MRC5, and HeLa. Then qRT-PCR was performed on the total RNAs from each cell line.
