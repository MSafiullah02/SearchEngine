            "text": "Although cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are known to clear viral infections by killing infected cells, recent studies suggest that they can also suppress the replication of certain viruses by noncytolytic mechanisms. We have examined this area by monitoring the immunopathological and antiviral consequences of antigen recognition by hepatitis B virus (HBV) specific CTL in HBV transgenic mice that express the viral gene products in their hepatocytes. We have shown that intravenously injected CTL rapidly trigger their target hepatocytes to undergo apoptosis, but that the direct cytopathic effect of the CTL is minimal in comparison with the cytopathic effects of the antigen-nonspecific intrahepatic inflammatoly response that they activate. In addition to killing the hepatocyte, the same CTL also downregulate HBV gene expression and completely abolish HBV replication in the hepatocytes that they don't destroy. This noncytolytic antiviral CTL effect is mediated by at least two distinct processes in these animals. First, the CTL cause a quantitative reduction in the steady state content of all HBV mRNA species in the hepatocyte, and this is followed by disappearance of all of the corresponding viral proteins in the liver and serum. The CTL initiate this process by secreting IFNy and TNFa when they are activated by antigen recognition. since the regulatory effect of the CTL can he prevented completely by prior administration of the corresponding antibodies. Nuclear run-on experiments reveal that viral mRNA transcription is unaffected despite the profound reduction in HBV mRNA content in the liver, suggesting that the CTL-derived cytokines accelerate viral mRNA degradation in the hepatocyte. A second noncytolytic antiviral pathway is also activated by the CTL. We have recently shown that HBV nucleocapsid particles, and the replicative HBV DNA intermediates that they contain, disappear from the transgenic mouse liver following either CTL administration or partial hepatectomy. the latter of which triggers hepatocellular regeneration without any change in hepatocellular HBV mRNA content. These results suggest that preformed HBV nucleocapsid particles may be actively degraded during hepatocyte turnover, and they raise the possibility that similar events might also occur in nondividing hepatocytes that are activated by noncytolytic signals delivered by the CTL. We propose that, in addition to their pathogenetic effect, the comhined effects of the CTL response at die HBV mRNA. nucleocapsid and rcplicative DNA levels may represent a curative antiviral stimulus during HBV infection. Since the virus must contain molecular elements that IEspond to these CTL-induced antiviral signals. inactivating mutations at these loci could be very efficiently selected by immune pressure, because a single mutation could abrogate the antiviral effect of a wide spectrum of T cell responses, irrespectrve of epitope specificity. Identification of these viral response elements and the intracellular pathways that interact with them may lead to the development of new strategies for antiviral drug design. Human fibroblasts infected with HSV are resistant to lysis by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), yet human B cell lines can be efficiently lysed by these CTL. The effect on human fibroblasts is rapid (within 2 hr of infection of cells), occurring before synthesis of MHC class I is altered by virus infection. A recombinant HSV, F-USBMHC, which expresses mouse MHC class I proteins does not render human fibroblasts sensitive to lysis by mouse CTL. MHC class I molecules are retained in the ER of HSV-infected fibroblasts i n a misfolded, unstable form and stability of the MHC complex can be restored by addition of exogenous peptides. Using a panel of HSV mutants and Ad expression vectors we demonstrated that the HSV IE protein ICP47 was both necessary and s f i c i e n t to cause retention of class I and ICP47 expression in fibroblasts caused the cells to resist lysis by CD8+ T lymphocytes. ICP47 is a soluble, cytosolic protein and we have found no evidence of membrane association.",

            "text": "Therefore, it appears that ICP47 inhibits cytosolic stages of the antigen presentation pathway so that antigenic peptides do not reach the ER. To date, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed to ICP47 have not specifically precipitated any of the previously described components of the antigen presentation pathway and we have not found ICP47 associated with TAP transporter proteins or proteosomes i n these experiments. The effects of ICP47 are being assessed in proteosome and TAP transporter assays. GST-ICP47 fusion proteins tightly bind a 8.5 kDa cytosolic cellular protein which is found in a number of adherent human cell lines but not lymphocytes. The protein has been purified and sequencing is in progress. In addition, radiolabelled ICP47 binds to a single cellular protein of =55 kDa on ligand blots. These proteins are good candidates as cellular targets of ICP47 and as novel components of the antigen presentation pathway. Preliminary experiments support the hypothesis that ICP47 is very effective i n blocking CD8+ T lymphocyte responses in vivo, perhaps explaining the predominance of CD4+ vs. CD8+ anti-HSV CTL i n vivo. We expect that ICP47 may be very useful, not only to elucidate antigen presentation pathways, but also to prevent immune recognition of gene transfer vectors and a s a immunosuppressive agent.",

Laning2, Martin E. Dorf2, and Thomas L. Benjamin2. IDepartment of Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, and 2Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115. Susceptibility to tumors induced by mouse polyoma virus varies among inbred mouse strains. We have previously shown that polyoma tumor susceptibility is controlled by products of MHC as well as non-MHC genes. In crosses between MHC-nonidentical strains differing in tumor susceptibility, resistance correlates with dominantkodominant inheritance of the resistant H-2 haplotype. We have observed the opposite pattern of inheritance of susceptibility in crosses between MHC-identical strains. In crosses between the highly susceptible C3WBiDa mouse and the highly resistant but MHC-identical (H-2k) C57BWcd.I mouse, polyoma tumor susceptibility is conferred by a single autosomal dominant gene, which we have designated Pyvs. PyJ does not encode cell receptors for the virus, affect viral dissemination or anti-viral antibody responses, or affect intracellular events essential for productive infection or cell transformation by the virus. Whole-body irradiation renders CS7BWcd.I mice fully susceptible to polyoma-induced tumors, indicating an immunological basis for this strain's resistance. We hypothesized that P y J encodes an Mtv superantigen (SAG) that confers susceptibility to C3WBiDa mice by deleting precursors of polyoma-specific T cells. We found that tumor susceptibility in (C3WBiDa x C57BWcd.I) x C57BWcdJ backcross mice cosegregated with Mtv-7. Inheritance of Mtv-7 showed perfect concordance with absence of peripheral Vp6+ T cells. Genotyping of backcrossmice using markers of simple sequence repeat polymorphisms flanking Mtv-7 showed no evidence of recombination between Pyvs and Mtv-7. Strongly biased usage of Vp6 by (a) polyoma-specific CD8+ CTL from virus-infected C57BWcdJ mice and by @) CD8+ T cells infiltrating a polyoma tumor in a virus-immune C57BWcd.I host provide further evidence that T cells bearing this Mtv-7 SAG-reactive Vp domain are critical anti-polyoma tumor effector cells. These results indicate identity between P y J and Mtv-7 sag, and demonstrate a novel mechanism of inherited susceptibility to virus-induced tumors based on effects of an endogenous superantigen on the host's T cell repertoire. Infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) causes a transient to longlasting immunosuppression dependent upon virus-isolate dose of virus and age, H-2, non H-2, level of CD4+ T cells, of CD8+ T cells and kinetics of neutralizing antibodies of the host. The immunohistological analysis suggests that CD8+ T cell dependent disappearence of marginal zone macrophages of follicular dendritic cells and of virus infected cells in general correlates with immunosuppression. The details of mechanisms responsible for these findings are now being analysed. A role of this CD8+ T cell dependent immunosuppression in the establishment of a LCMV carrier state in immunocompetent mice is suggested by the following experiments: The otherwise slow and low neutralizing antibody response agamst LCMV is accelerated and enhanced by CD8+ T cell depletion at the time of infection, suggesting virus-specific immunopathology being responsible at least partially. The ELISA antibody response is not significantly altered under the same conditions but is abrogated if LCMV-specific T cell receptor transgenic mice are infected with high doses of LCMV, indicating, that suppression of the specific antibody response depends upon the relative kinetics of CTL versus antibody responses. Whether exhaustion of specific CTL responses is enhanced by similar mechanisms remains to be tested. The role of interleukins of the relative distribution of virus in the mouse and in the various aspects of immunosuppression are now being studied. Immunosuppression, caused by CD8+ T cell-dependent immunopathology, may also be operational in HIV infection in humans. Such a pathogenesis of HIV-triggered AIDS could explain several aspects of the disease process not readily fitting the (unproven) conventional idea that HIV is causing immunodeficiency via direct viral pathogenicity. The cellular immunity against two DNA tumor viruses (i.e. human adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) and human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16)) was studied with respect to possible immune escape mechanisms and to the development of CTL epitope based peptide vaccines. After identifying an immunorelevant CTL epitope in the Ad 5E1A protein to which CTL clones were directed that could eradicate Ad 5E1 induced tumors in nude mice, an amino acid replacement study of this epitope revealed a point mutation that totally eliminated the possibility to recognize the mutant peptide by the CTL clones directed against the wild-type peptide sequence. New viral constructs were made that contained this point mutation and used to transform mouse embryo cells. However, these mutant tumor cells were still immunogenic and CTL clones specific for these mutant tumor cells were shown to react with a peptide derived from the Ad 5E1B protein. These Ad 5EIB specific CTL clones, however, were as effective as the Ad 5E1A specific CTL clones in the eradication of Ad 5E1 induced tumors in nude animals, indicating that a choice can be made of immunorelevant epitopes to which an immunization strategy could be developed. In addition, we discovered that by supertransfection of Ad 5E1 induced tumor cells with the activated ras oncogen the possibility of Ad 5E1B specific CTL to recognize the Ad 5E1 induced tumors was eliminated whereas the Ad 5E1A specific CTL could still kill these tumor cells. This might indicate a new mechanism of tumors to escape CTL.",

By changing the anchor residues in that peptide an even more immunoprotective peptide could be generated. Combined, these data indicated a successful use of a CTL epitope based peptide vaccine in the prevention of HPV16 induced tumors in mice. Subsequently this led us to identify relevant CTL epitopes of HPV16, that is highly associated with cervical carcinoma in humans, for the major HLA-A alleles (i.e. HLA-A *0101, A *0201, A\"0301, A*1101 and A *2401). Together these alleles cover a majority of all humans. CTL epitopes were identified through peptide-MHC binding assays followed by in v i m peptide immunizations with high affinity binding peptides to induce primary CTL responses and immunogenicity studies in HLA-A transgenic mice. Thereafter, memory CTL responses were measured in cervical cancer patients against selected peptides. Combined, these data led us to develop a CTL epitope based peptide vaccine that could be of use in HPV16 induced cervical cancer patients. A clinical trial for this disease is scheduled to start in the fall of 1994.",

Their RNA genomes encode a large polyprotein which is cleaved proteolytically in co-and post-translational reactions to yield all mature viral proteins necessary to establish an infection. Although originally thought to be exclusively murine in host range, both viruses actually infect a wide range of mammals. EMCV has caused devastating epizootics in captive primates (eg: macaques, chimps and baboons), domestic pigs and exotic zoo collections (elephants, lions and tigers). Death, following ingestion of virus-contaminated material, is rapid, and caused by extensive meningoencephalitis and virus-induced damage to the CNS. Myocarditic lesions are common in older animals. When administered intracerebrally, the LD,, for EMCV strain R is about 1 pfu. We are studying the pathogenesis of EMCV and Mengo with engineered cDNA plasmids containing infectious viral sequences. Many plasmids contain h'uncated versions of the unusual 5' noncoding homopolymeric poly(C) tract that is a hallmark of these cardioviruses. Short poly(C) Mengoviruses grow very well in tissue culture but are 106-10'z fold less pathogenic to mice than the wild-type strains. Animals receiving sublethal doses of short-tract Mengo strains develop high titers of neutralizing antibodies, exhibit potent CTL responses and acquire lifelong protective immunity against challenge with wild-type virus. The genetic stability of the short-tract strains, even upon serial brain passage, mark them as safe, efficacious live vaccines. Currently, we believe the poly(C) phenomenon is due to interference by the wild-type virus sequences (long poly(C) tract) with normal cellular cytokine induction mechanisms (ie: IFa and IFP) during the initial stages of animal infection. The targeted cells are probably macrophages, and their singular ability to correctly respond or not respond to poly(C) tract length during the first few hours of infection determines whether an inoculated animal will live (protectively vaccinated) or die. The short-tract viruses probably induce IF in the macrophages, and are consequently killed then rapidly cleared from the host In related experiments we've found that attenuated Mengo strains can easily carry large heterologous insertions within their genomes, and express these sequences into protein them during replication in animals. The resulting immune response (B cell and CTL) to the chimeras is directed towards the foreign sequences (epitopes) as well as towards the Mengo proteins. A chimeric HIV vaccine, a rabies vaccine and an LCMV vaccine have been developed and tested. The LCMV chimera seems especially effective, as a single pfu of this engineered Mengo strain, administered orally to a mouse, is sufficient for complete immunogenic protection against intracerebral challenge with wild-type LCMV virus. RSV is the most common cause of serious viral lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children. We have recently renewed our efforts to generate a safe and effective live attenuated RSV vaccine for topical administration that will overcome the deficiencies of previously studied live and non-living RSV vaccines. This vaccine will be a bivalent vaccine consisting of subgroup A and B live attenuated virus components. Since the peak incidence of severe disease caused by RSV is in the 2-month old infant, an RSV vaccine will need to be effective when given to 1-month old infants. Based on the success of live poliovirus vaccines given early in infancy, it is anticipated that the intranasally administered live virus vaccine will infect and induce a protective local and systemic immune response even in infants with passively acquired maternal antibodies. The main approach that we have taken in this effort to develop the live RSV vaccine is to introduce one or more ts mutations by chemical mutagenesis into a cold-passaged virus (cpRSV) that had been partially attenuated by the acquisition of host-range mutations selected by passage in cells of a heterologous host species. We have developed a large set of cpRSV subgroup A rs mutants (termed cprs mutants) that contain the host-range mutations selected during cold passage and two or more ts mutations introduced by chemical mutagenesis. These mutants have been evaluated in virro for their level of temperature sensitivity and in vivo in rodents, chimpanzees, and humans. A large set of RSV subgroup B cpts mutants has been similarly produced and evaluated.",

The three candidate vaccine strains were immunogenic and induced significant resistance to RSV challenge in both groups of chimpanzees.

Long-lived polarized memory populations are generated from the polarized effectors and these persist for prolonged period in the absence of apparent Ag stimulation. This supports the idea that factors other than antigenic stimulation, present in situ can support the expansion and maintenance of memory cells. The rabies glycoprotein (G) is the only external protein of the virion and is therefore responsible for any interaction that rabies makes with the host cell during the first steps of the virus cycle. The G protein is also the target of neutralizing antibodies. There are around 450 trimers of G at the virion surface which constitute the spikes visible by electron microscopy. Upon exposure to slightly acidic pH, the glycoprotein undergoes a conformational change which results in Ion er and less regular spikes. Strikingly and quite differently from influenza hemagglutinin, this conformational change is reversible: if the p d is risen back to 7.0, the s ikes re ain their neutral configuration (1). Probably as a consequence, the viral infectivity is totally preserved after an exposure of 2 hours at p 8 6.4 an cf 37T, which induces the conformational change, followed by an incubation at neutral pH. Since the conformational change is reversible, there is a pH-dependant equilibrium between the native and the low-pH conformation: the higher the pH, the more spikes are in their native configuration. Two main antigenic sites and several minor sites have been identified on the native rabies glycoprotein (2). Specific amino acids belonging to each of the two major antigenic sites are important or essential for viral virulence. For instance a lysine in position 198, which is part of antigenic site 11, is important, although not essential, for the viral virulence. Similarly, the arginine 333, which belongs to antigenic site 111, is essential for pathogenicity while dispensable for multiplication in cell culture (reviewed in 3). Viral strains mutated at arginine 333 have lost the capability to penetrate certain categories of neurons, suggesting that this mutation affected the recognition of specific receptors or subsequent interactions necessaly for the penetration of the virus at nerve terminals. Therefore the two main antigenic sites are regions of the glycoprotein which also interact specifically with neurons in the animals. We have found that neutralization requires the fixation of at least one or two IgG for every three spikes, irrelevant of the anti enic site recognized by the antibody (4). Most neutralizing antibodies recognize conformational epitopes which are accessible on the native configuration of the protein. Some epitopes remain accessible also on the acidic configuration while others are not. In addition, a minority of antibodies recognize epitopes which are only accessible on the acidic conformation. This is not unlikely in view that each spike has a certain probability to undergo a conformational change, even at neutral pH. In consequence the surface of the virus probably fluctuates and G epitopes which are not accessible on the native glycoprotein could be transiently exposed. Conformational flexibility at neutral pH and physiological temperatures has also been observed for poliovirus (5). Structural flexibility of external proteins could have important implications in virus-host interactions. Katpus, Norlhwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL 6061 1 Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis viruses (TMEV) are endemic enteric pathogens of wild and colony-reared mice. lntracerebral inoculation of susceptible mouse strains leads to a chronic, progressive inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized clinically by an abnormal gait, progressive spastic hind limb paralysis and urinary incontinence, and histologically by parenchymal and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration and demyelination of CNS white matter tracts. Demyelination is related to persistent CNS viral infection. Due to the similarity in clinical and histological presentation, TMEV-induced demyelination is considered to be a highly relevant model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Our current interests are in determining the phenotype, fine specificity, lymphokine profile and TCR usage of CNS-infiltrating cells involved in the effector stages of TMEV-induced demyelination. Based on a variety of experimental evidence, it is clear that demyelination induced in SJUJ mice by infection with the BeAn strain of TMEV is a Thl-mediated event: (a) disease induction is suppressed in T cell-deprived mice and by in vivo treatment with anti-I-A and anti-CD4 antibodies; (b) disease susceptibility correlates temporally with the development of TMEV-specific, MHC-class Il-restricted DTH responses and with a predominance of anti-viral lgG2a antibody; (c) activated (Le., lL-2RC) T cells infiltrating the CNS are exclusively of the CD4+ phenotype, and (d) proinflammatory cytokines (IFNq and TNF-p) are predominantly produced in the CNS. We have mapped the predominant Thl epitope on the virion to amino acids 74-86 of the VP2 capsid protein. A Thl line specific for VP274-86 exacerbates the onset of demyelination in recipient mice infected with a suboptimal dose of TMEV. TMEV-infected SJUJ mice fail to exhibit peripheral DTH and T cell proliferative responses to the major myelin proteins, MBP and PLP, and pre-tolerization with neuroantigens has no affect on the incidence or severity of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease, whereas neuroantigen-specific tolerance prevents the induction of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast, tolerance induced with intact TMEV virions specifically anergizes virus-specific Thl responses and results in a dramatic reduction of the incidence and severity of clinical disease and CNS dernyelination in SJUJ mice subsequently infected with TMEV. These results have important implications for a possible viral trigger in MS as they indicate that chronic demyelination in TMEV-infected mice is initiated in the absence of demonstrable neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses and are consistent with a model wherein early myelin damage is mediated via primarily by mononuclear phagocytes recruited to the CNS and activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by TMEV-specific Thl cells. The concept that prions m novel pathogens which are different fium both viroids and viruses has received increasing support from many avenues of investigation over the past decade. Enriching fractions from Syrian hamster (SHa) brain for scrap= prion infectivity led to the discovery of the prion protein 0. Prion diseases of animals include scrapie and mad cow disease; those of humans present as inherited, sporadic and W o r n neurodegenemive disorders.

Transgenic v g ) mice expressing both SHa and m o w @lo) PrP genes were used to demonstrate that the \"specie9 bank?' for -pie prions resides in the primary structure of PIP. This concept was strengthened by the results of studies with mice expressing chimeric MdSHa transgenes &om which \"artificial\" prions have been synthesized. Similar chimeric Mdhuman (Hu) RP transgenes were constructed which differ from M O W by 9 amino acids between residues 96 and 167.

CD8' lymphocytes (TCD8+) play an important role in host immunity to viruses and other intracellular parasites. Virus-specific TCDI+ recognize MHC class I molecules in association with peptides of 8 to 10 residues derived from viral proteins. This presentation will focus on how and where antigenic peptides are generated by cells. To begin to characterize the nature of proteases involved in the generation of antigenic peptides from cytosolic proteins, we used a panel of recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing different forms of influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP). We found that the efficiency of generation of two NP peptides is related to the metabolic stability of the source gene product. There has been considerable speculation that such short lived proteins are degraded by proteasomes in a ubiquitin-targeted process. Our observations, however, call into question the importance of ubiquitin targeted-proteolysis in generating antigenic peptides from exogenously provided or endogenously synthesized viral proteins. We also examined the extent to which antigenic peptides can be generated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that antigenic peptides could be produced from short precursors (17 residues) hut not from a number of full length proteins (influenza virus hemagglutinin, NP, ovalbumin) that are targeted to the ER by a NH2-terminal signal sequence. Peptides were generated much more efficiently from the COOH-terminus of the 17 residue precursor than from the NH2-terminus. These findings indicate that the ER has a much more limited capacity than the cytosol to generate antigenic peptides, but that ER proteases (particularly aminopeptidases) could perform the final proteolytic steps in the generation of class I binding peptides from precursors imported from the cytosol by TAP, the MHC encoded peptide transporter.",

            "text": "Potential advantages of synthetic peptide or engineered recombinant vaccines are that they can be limited to contain only the specific antigenic determinants for desired responses without other determinants that elicit unwanted responses, and that the sequences of the determinants themselves can be modified to enhance potency or breadth of crossreactivity. However, they can have the disadvantage that any single determinant may be presented by only a limited selection of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of the species. To overcome the problem of MHC polymorphism, we have identified determinants presented by multiple MHC molecules, and have also located multideterminant regions of the HIV-1 envelope protein that contain overlapping determinants each presented by different class I1 MHC molecules, so that the whole multideterminant region is presented by multiple MHC molecules of both mouse and human. We have made use of \"cluster peptides\" spanning these multideterminant regions of the HIV-1 envelope to provide help for neutralizing antibody (Ab) and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to peptides attached to these helper regions. These synthetic peptide vaccine constructs containing the P18 peptide from the V3 loop of HIV-1 IIIB or MN, elicited both neutralizing Ab and CTL in multiple strains of mice. The cluster peptides inducing helper T cells were essential for elicitation of Ab and CTL to the P18 segment of both IIIB and MN strains of HIV-1 in mice of several MHC haplotypes. Several adjuvants were compared for their ability to elicit both CTL and Ab simultaneously, without one response inhibiting the other. A single formulation in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) could elicit all 3 responses, neutralizing Ab, CTL, and TH1 helper cells. The CTL specific for the MN strain P18 peptide crossreacted with strains SC, SF2,2321, and CDC4. The peptides in F A also elicit high titers of antibodies in rabbits. Boosting was found to enhance CTL responses as well as Ab responses. These constructs are being prepared for a human immunotherapy trial. These vaccine constructs are potent and also avoid sites on gp160 that are known to elicit enhancing antibodies or autoimmune responses that might conmbute to disease pathogenesis. However, we can potentially improve on these by tinkering with the internal structure of the individual epitopes. We have found that replacing a negatively charged glutamic acid residue with an uncharged amino acid in one of the helper determinants makes it 10 to 100-fold more potent in binding to the class I1 MHC molecule and in eliciting murine helper T cells that still recognize the natural HIV-1 sequence. Thus, such a modified peptide should be more potent as a vaccine, while retaining the ability to elicit T cells that will respond to HIV proteins that of course do not have the altered sequence. We are currently mapping the critical residues for presentation of one of these peptides by human HLA-A2, with the intent of developing modified peptides that will be more potent as components of a human vaccine. Thus, by leaming how these peptides bind to MHC molecules and Tcell receptors, we can design internally modified determinants to construct more potent or more crossreactive second generation vaccines. We are testing these vaccine approaches in a mouse model in which mice can be protected against tumor cells expressing HIV proteins as would an HIVinfected cell. DNA vaccines, comprised of non-replicating plasmids encoding viral proteins, are capable of generating protective immunity in animal models of several viral diseases. In preclinical models of influenza infection, reduced viral shedding was observed in DNA-vaccinated ferrets after challenge with the human clinical virus strain, A/Georgia/93. Cross-strain protection was conferred by DNA encoding the major internal proteins (nucleoprotein, NP, and matrix, M1) and the surface protein haemagglutinin (HA) from the antigenically-distinct previous virus strains, A/Beijing/89 and A/Hawaii/91. This protective efficacy was greater than that seen by immunization with the widely-used clinical vaccine composed of killed A/Beijing/89 virus. Thus, compared to a killed virus vaccine, protection seen with the DNA vacane against a drifted virus strain was greater. We previously demonstrated that immunization of mice with NP DNA generated MHC Class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

Whereas neuroectodermal cells, especially neurons, are the target cells of most neurovirulent viruses, the main target cell in the brain for SIV and other lentiviruses is the macrophage. Infection in, expression of viral antigens by and products of SIV replication exported from these cells result in inflammation and degenerative changes in the brain and concomitant loss of neurons. SIV strains that are mainly T-cell tropic cause transient activation of T-cells and during this period, infected T-cells cross the blood brain barrier and localize in the brain causing persistent hut minimally productive infection and minimal neuro pathologic effects. Viral proteins but not virions are produced continuously. By virtue of the tropism of the virus for CD4 T cells, many infected animals eventually become immunosuppressed and develop AIDS, but not classical ueurological disease. Viruses which are macrophage tropic invade the brain presumably also in T lymphocytes and the viruses infect macrophages in the brain. However, productive virus replication is minimized by antiviral CD8 T cells which suppress (kill?) all virus producing cells throughout the body, including the CNS. Productive virus replication in brain macrophages and accompanying inflammatory changes develop only when CD8 cells fail i.e. after profound immunosuppression sets in. The neurological disease that results from productive virus replication in macrophages in the brain therefore depends on presence of an appropriate macrophage-tropic viral phenotype invading the neuropil and development of immunosuppression in the host. The neurological disease could therefore be defined as one of the AIDS syndromes. The adenovirus (Ad) early transcription region (E3) codes for more than 7 polypeptides, four of which have already been shown to alter the immune response to Ad infection. The amount of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the plasma membrane can be reduced by the binding of the Ad E3 gpl9K protein to the MHC heavy chain, which prevents transport of the complex out of the endoplasmic reticulum. This process interferes with presentation of viral peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Cytolysis by tumor necrosis factor-o (TNF) is inhibited by 4 distinct viral polypeptides, 3 of which (the Ad E3 14.7K or the complex of the 10.4K and 14.5K proteins) are coded in the E3 region. The E3 polypeptides are translated from a family of viral mRNAs, that are synthesized from a single viral promoter and processed by alternative splicing. We have studied the functions of the E3 polypeptides in several murine models. The goals of these experiments were to determine the effects of the Ad E3 polypeptides in acute and persistent viral infections as well as in a transplantation model designed to measure whether these viral immunoregulatory proteins would abrogate allogeneic graft rejection. In a vaccinia virus (V.V.) pneumonia model, in which the isolated Ad E3 14.7K or Ad E3 gpl9K genes were inserted into the V.V. pathogen, the Ad anti TNF polypeptide increased viral virulence but the Ad anti MHC had no effects.",

            "text": "In addition to manipulating the Ad E3 genes in viral constructs, several transgenic mouse lines containing the Ad E3 genes have been constructed for these experiments. The E3 genomic DNA behind the rat insulin promoter (RIP) has been used to generate transgenic animals. Islets from RIP-E3 transgenic animals (H-2b'd) have been transplanted allogeneically to H-2d recipients and remained viable, secreting insulin until the end of the experiment at 94 days; in contrast, control nontransgenic islets of the same genotype were rejected by 21-28 days. The E3 genes behind the native E3 promoter have been inserted into mouse embryos to generate transgenic animals, and the expression of the transgene monitored in multiple organs. The E3 promoter of the transgene is responsive to stimulation by the Ad E1A following infection with an E3 minus Ad 7001 and can also be upregulated by administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The effects of this transgene on Ad pathogenesis are currently being studied. Thus, these viral immunoregulatory genes have been shown to alter viral pathogenicity during acute infection and to downregulate the host immune response sufficiently to permit islet cell transplantation. These results on manipulating the Ad E3 genes for the control of the host immune response also have implications for designing adenovirus vectors for gene therapy. \"Emerging\" infections can be defined as infectious diseases that either have newly appeared in the population, or that are rapidly increasing their incidence or expanding their geographic range. Recent viral examples include AIDS, Ebola, and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (fnst identified in a 1993 outbreak in the southwestern U.S.). Emerging viral infections show a number of common features. Most \"new\" viruses derive from existing viruses that move into new areas or acquire new hosts (\"viral traffic\"). Many are zoonotic (originating from animal sources) (even pandemic influenza appears usually to be a reassortant originating in wildfowl). Ecological or environmental changes (either natural, or, often, man-made) may precipitate emergence of new diseases by placing people in contact with a previously unfamiliar zoonotic reservoir or by increasing the density of a MtUd host or vector of a pathogen, increasing the chances of human exposure. Upon introduction into a human population from a zoonotic reservoir, the newly introduced virus may cause localized outbreaks of disease. Some may show rapid variation and evolution upon introduction, and some evidence suggests a role for immune selection in this process. A few viruses (such as HIV) may succeed in establishing themselves and disseminating in the human population, becoming truly \"human\" infections. Human activities can also play an important role in establishment and dissemination. Migrations from rural areas to cities, now an accelerating worldwide phenomenon, or other displacements, can introduce remote viruses to a larger population; the virus may then spread along highways and (globally) by air travel. The development of an effective system of surveillance and rapid response is essential, but resources for this are presently inadequate. Vaccine development, production, and deployment problems also need to be addressed. Immunopathology may be a key feature of many of these infections, a number of which manifest as hemorrhagic fevers. Many of the life threatening complications are due to increased vascular permeability. The resemblances to septic shock suggest that cytokines (such as TNF) are likely to be important in the pathogenesis of these infections. The response of cells, such as the macrophage, that induce or synthesize key cytokines, may be an important element, and the ability to infect these cells may be one common denominator. Why some viruses elicit this response, while other closely related viruses do not, cannot yet be predicted from molecular data. Better understanding of these aspects of the immune response should lead to additional therapeutic strategies. (Supported by NIH grant ROI RR03121.) Genetic approaches have been used to detect and characterize numerous previously unidentified hantaviruses. PuumalaRrospect HilVSin Nombre-like viruses or virus variants are present throughout North and South America, Europe and Russia. Several of the American viruses identified are associated with the newly recognized Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), a severe respiratory illness with high mortality. The genetic relationships of these and previously characterized hantaviruses have been studied by phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence differences located in PCR bgments amplified from the G2 encoding region of the virus M segments. The relationships observed are consistent with a long-term association of viruses with their primary rodent reservoirs and suggestive of coevolution of host and virus. A Sin Nombre virus isolate is now available and its genetic characterization has been completed. Various virus antigens have been expressed and are being used to probe the interaction of the virus with the host immune system.",

Vaccines for hantaviruses are not readily available, although a number of inactivated viral preparations have been made and tested in Asia.

Our vaccine is a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the M segment of Hantaan virus under control of the vaccinia virus 7.5 K promoter and the S segment under control of the 11 K promoter. The M segment, which encodes the G1 and G2 envelope proteins, was included because of our findings that: (1) immunization with vaccinia or baculovirus-expressed G1 and G2 induced a neutralizing and protective immune response in hamsters; and, (2) neutralizing antibodies to G1 or G2 could passively protect hamsters from challenge with virulent virus. The S segment, which encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N), was included because of our finding that hamsters immunized with baculovirus-expressed N also were protected from subsequent infection. Although the protective immune response to N is probably cell-mediated, the importance of such a response is presently not well defined. Assessment of our vaccine in preclinical studies, indicated that immunized hamsters developed neutralizing antibodies and were protected from displaying viral antigen in their lungs after challenge. In a Phase I, dose escalation, clinical study, the vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies in individuals immunized subcutaneously with approximately lo7 PFU of the recombinant virus. In addition to humoral responses, immunized volunteers developed a cell-mediated immune response as indicated in lymphocyte proliferation assays. Larger clinical studies, including alternate routes or booster immunizations, are planned. Based on these studies, we anticipate that the vaccine will be efficacious for preventing HFRS caused by Hantaan and the antigenically closely related Seoul virus. We are studying the cross-protective properties of this vaccine with more distantly related hantaviruses such as Puumala virus. Although we expect this vaccine to be safe as well as effective, we also are investigating the use of more attenuated pox-viruses as vaccine vectors. Infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus (LCMV) results in a profound expansion in the number of spleen CD8 T cells and in the induction of virus-specific CTL activity. Thereafter, the CD8 T cell number declines, and the CTL activity diminishes, though the frequency of LCMVspecific precursor CTL per CD8 cell, as assessed by limiting dilution assays (LDA), is remarkably stable throughout long-term immunity. The decline in T cell and total spleen leukocyte number at the late stages of acute infection is associated with high levels of apoptosis, as detected by the in situ nucleotidyl transferase assay. Apoptosis occurred in both the T cell and B cell populations, with the B cells dying in clusters. This apoptosis was also seen in tfansgenic mice ectopically expressing Bcl-2 in the T and B cells and in C57BL/6 Ipr/@r mice, which have a mutation in the fas gene. T cells from the infected animal underwent apoptosis in vitro when stimulated through the TcR with anti-CD3, thereby explaining some of the immunosuppression seen during acute viral infections. Memory cells persisted for over a year and could be found in blast-size cell populations. Challenge of LCMV-immune mice with either Pichinde virus, vaccinia virus, or murine cytomegalovirus led to the reactivation of the LCMV-specific CTL response. LDA analyses showed unexpectedly that these heterologous viruses crossreacted with subpopulations of LCMV-specific memory T cells. This memory T cell response to virus from an earlier infection was associated with enhanced immunopathology and enhanced clearance of virus during a heterologous virus challenge. Over the course of the acute infection, CTL specific for the second virus were preferentially expanded over the crossreactive CTL, and after the acute infection, when the T cell response had subsided, CTL memory to the first infection had decreased. There is therefore a network of memory T cells which contribute to and are modulated by infections with putatively unrelated viruses, and apoptosis plays a homeostatic role in the course of these T cell responses.",

Development of protective immunity in these vaccinated animals occurs only after several months of infection, with maximal protection observed after one year. The specific immune responses responsible for mediating protection have not been defined, and little is known about the cellular immune responses in animals vaccinated with these live attenuated retroviruses. We have analyzed cellular and humoral immune responses in rhesus macaques and chimpanzees infected with live attenuated retroviruses. SIV-specific neutralizing antibodies were present in vaccinated animals, but did not clearly correlate with protection against challenge. CTL specific for envelope and gag were identified in vaccinated macaques studied 12 or more months after vaccination. Quantitation of SIV-specific CTL activity in one of these animals using limiting dilution analysis revealed a relatively high precursor frequency of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, up to MOO0 for gag and 1/8500 for envelope. CD8+ lymphocytes obtained from vaccinated macaques were also able to suppress SIV replication in autologous CD4+ cells. Suppression mediated by unstimulated CD8 autologous cells was maximal when cells were in direct contact with SIV-infected lymphocytes, but CD8+ cells activated by an anti-CD3-specific monoclonal antibody were able to release. a potent soluble inhibitor of SIV replication. In contraSt to the relatively vigorous CTL response present in vaccinated macaques, we were not able to detect consistent CTL activity in chimpanzees infected with a HIV-1 molecular clone (NL43) or attenuated viruses at periods up to one year after infection, despite the use of a variety of stimulation techniques. Proliferative responses to HIV p24 and gp160 were observed in chimpanzees infected with N U 3 and attenuated variants. Although the relative contribution of these immune responses to protective immunity is not known, the relative vigor of the cellular immune responses observed in vaccinated macaques suggest they may play a role in mediating resistance to challenge. Obiectives: To analyze the magnitude and specificity of the CTL response to HIV-1, and to determine the TCR usage by clonal CTL responses in infected persons, including persons with documented infection of up to 15 years with CD4 cells > 500/mm3. Methods: HIV-l-specific CTL activity was evaluated in PBMC as well as in PBMC stimulated in vitro with HN-1 infected autologous CD4 cells, using target cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing HN-1 proteins. CTL epitopes recognized by these individuals were determined using cloned effector cells. Quantitative cultures were performed by endpoint dilution, and viral quantitation was determined by QC-PCR TCR analysis was performed by PCR, using both family-specific primers and anchored PCR, followed by sequencing. Sequence analysis of CTL epitopes in autologous viruses was determined by PCR amplification and sequencing.

Detailed epitope mapping in a person infected for 15 years, who by QC-PCR had <I67 viral RNA molecules per ml and who tested negative by bDNA assay, revealed CTL clones directed at six different epitopes, with detectable recognition of three of these epitopes using freshly isolated PBMC as effector cells. The CTL clones were broadly reactive against many hown HIV-1 variants, and both the p17 and p24 epitopes were cross reactive with SIV. Sequence analysis of autologous virus within the three dominant CTL epitopes revealed the lack of immune escape variants in PBMC, plasma, and virus obtained from coculhue. supernatant. Analysis of TCR usage by clones to defined epitopes in persons at different disease stages revealed heterogeneity in TCR usage and heterogeneity in recognition of virus variants withii these epitopes. Analysis of clonal frequency using an oligonucleotide probe to the CDR3 region of the TCR in an individual with a vigorous response to gp41 suggested that approximately 6% of circulating T cells were a single HIV-l-specific clone. Conclusions: Our results indicate that cytotoxic T lymphocytes are part of the immune response in persistent non-progressive HIV-1 infection, and that prolonged infection can occur without the development of viral immune escape variation within defined CTL epitopes. In addition, vigorous circulating CTL responses can occur in the setting of an e x m e l y low viral load. Heterogeneity in the ability of clones from different individuals to recognize sequence variation within CTL epitopes may be important in the pathogenesis of infection.

Coxsackievirus 8 3 (CVB3), a member of the Picornavirus family, is a common cause of acute or chronic human myocarditis. However, whether cell damage results primarily from direct virusmediated effects or from immune-mediated destruction of the heart tissue during the infection remains unclear. We used a cardiovirulent variant of CVB3 which is able to infect several strains of mice. The infection results in a disease which strongly implicates immunopathogenetic mechanisms in myofiber necrosis. To characterize the role of the immune system in this disease we used various transgenic knockout (ko) mice with different immune defects. CVB3 is able to infect normal C57BL/6 mice and immunocompromised (CD4 ko and 62M ko) mice and causes a lethal disease after i.p. injection in a viral dose dependent manner. We found elevated LD5Os in immunocompromised mice, which also die slightly later than normal mice. This virus replicates in the hearts of all mice used with maximal titers 3-5 days pi.. Large pathological changes were detectable only in heart tissue of CD4 ko mice, and were maximal at 1-2 weeks after infection.

Coxsackievirus 83 (CVB3) causes severe heart disease in adult mice, and is a useful model for the human cardiac conditions of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. In this study, we have demonstrated that transgenic mice lacking the T-cell signalling molecule p56kk are resistant to CVB3 induced heart disease. The virus replicates in the heart, and is cleared from the myocardium at a rate comparable to \"normal\" littermates, but there is only minimal mortality, or damage to the cardiac tissue. However, in Ick-deficient mice depleted of natural killer (NK) cells prior to viral infection, there is increased CVB3 replication, and some infiltration by mononuclear cells in the myocardium. To further elucidate the role of the immune system in CVB3induced heart disease, cytokine expression in the hearts of CVB3 infected normal, Ick-deficient, and NK-cell depleted mice is under investigation. We conclude that T-cell activation is critical to produce substantive myofiber necrosis after CVB3 infection, that NK-cells play an fundamental role in protecting the mice from severe virus infection, and that Ick transgenic mice serve as an important model for understandina the Dathogenic mechanisms involved. We now show that CD4+ T cells from 62m-/-mice exhibit antigen specific release of serine esterase and interferon-gamma. Further, as quantitated by flow cytometry, the early decrease in CD4+ T cells seen in normal mice 3 days after LCMV infection, previously presumed to be due to the activity of CD8+ CTL, still occurs in 62m-/-mice. However, 621114mice show an earlier rise in percentage and absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells by 7 days after infection. CD4+ T cells from am-/mice rise to above baseline levels with kinetics paralleling the early rise in CD8+ T cells in normal mice after LCMV infection. CD4+ CIZ activity is lower in 62m-/mice and have a later peak than CD8+ CTL from normal mice. These differences may explain the lower mortality and longer time course of immunopathologic meningitis in 621114-mice. mice can assume some of the cytotoxic functions of the CD8+ cell population from normal mice, including immune-mediated pathology. Further, CD4+ T cells from 62m-/-mice have the capacity to release serine esterase, and show kinetics similar to CD8+ T cells from normal mice.",

The interaction between CD40 and its ligand, in the presence of B cell acting cytokines, such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), is sufficient to trigger B cells to proliferate and differentiate and to induce immunoglobulin class switching. A recombinant vaccinia virus encoding both factors, CD40L and IL-4, did not, however, stimulate an enhanced antibody response in mice infected with the construct. Instead, the antibody levels were lower than those of mice infected with a control virus. The reduced antibody response reflected the diminished growth of CD4OL-expressing viruses, to the extent that immunocompromised mice were able to resolve these infections. The kinetics of virus clearance indicate that the anti-viral mechanism of CWOL is rapidly activated and has generalized tissue distribution. The CWOLmediated clearance of virus is independent of the anti-viral cytokines, TNF and IFN-y. The anti-viral activity of C W L may represent a surprising and potent effector mechanism of T cells activated during a virus infection. Mary's Medical School, Norfolk Place, London W2 lPG, U.

Less is known about the effects of IL-3 on T cell development and proliferation and its effect on the host response to infection by common pathogens. The IL-3 gene was disrupted in 129/Sv embryonic stem (ES) cells by homologous recombination after transfection with omega-type constructs flanked with a herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene. These cells were used to produce a mouse strain deficient of IL-3. Mice were infected intranasally with A 2 strain RS virus; pathological changes in the lung were monitored by cytology of bronchial lavage, and virus persistence by nested RT-PCR of lavage fluid and lung homogenate. No differences were found in pathology or virus persistence between knockouts and normal mice. IL-3 deficiency is therefore compatible with apparently normal responses to viral infection. Recombinant adenoviruses are an atuactive vehicle for gene therapy to lung in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). First generation viruses deleted of Ela and Elb transduce genes into airway epithelial cells in vivo, however, expression of the transgene is transient and associated with substantial inflammatory responses, and gene transfer is significantly reduced following a second administration of the virus. In this study, we have used mice deficient in immunological effector functions in combination with adoptive and passive nansfer techniques to define antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses that underlie these important limitations.",

            "text": "Our studies indicate that MHC class I resmcted CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are activated in response to viral antigens leading to destruction of virus infected cells and loss of transgene expression. MHC class II associated presentation of viral antigens activates CD4+T helper (TH) cells of the -1 subset and, to a lesser extent, of the Tm subset. LDV establishes a life long viremic infection in mice which is not controlled by anti-LDV immune responses. Anti-LDV antibodies are rapidly generated but they neutralize LDV infectivity only poorly. Here we show that LDV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs)are generated within 7 days pi. C T L s were detected by H-2 specific lysis of LDV-specific target cells. These target cells were generated by transfection of 3T3-NM cells with a retrovirus vector carrying the gene (OW 7) for the LDV nucleocapsid (N) protein. Spleen cells from LDV-infected mice were incubated in vitro with LDV-infected macrophages or transfected 3T3-NIH cells and cultured for 5 days in the presence of IL-2. The CTLs had largely disappeared in mice by 30 days pi. The following experiments were conducted to further explore the mechanism of immune escape. In situ hybridization was used to localize LDVinfected cells in tissues of infected mice. These were found in persistently infected mice only in the liver. testis, and lymphoidal tissues. In addition large amounts of virion or virion debris accumulated in the germinal centers of the spleen and lymph nodes beginning about 3 days p.i. The accumulation of large amounts of LDV antigen in the germinal centers may be causally related to the suppression of the CTL response as well as to the polyclonal activation of B cells associated with LDV infection. To determine whether immune selection plays a role in LDV immune escape, LDV was reisolated from nude and immunocompetent BALB/c mice at various times pi. The OWs for the Nand the two envelope glycoproteins were R T K R amplified and sequenced. The role of cytokines in initiating the immune response to Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) was investigated. Mice were infected in the left rear foot pad with either cloned virulent VEE (V3000) or an isogenic single-site attenuated VEE mutant (V3032) (single amino acid change at E2 glycoprotein position 209 from glu-lys) and at 1,6,24,48,72, and 96 hours post-infection, the popliteal lymph nodes and spleen were harvested and examined for TNF-a, IL-12, IFN-y, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 gene expression using a quantitative RT-PCR. In both strains elevations of TNF-a, IL-12, IFN-y, IL-10, and IL-6 were detected in the lymph node, with no changes in either IL-2 or IL-4; however, whereas cytokine elevations were detected by 6 hours after injection of V3000, elevations were delayed until 24 hours following infection with V3032. Cytokine mRNA elevations in the spleen were less substantial, but elevated levels of IFN-y, IL-10, and IL-12 were also observed. These findings suggest that VEE infection induces an early highly specific cytokine pattern associated with simultaneous elevations in both IFN-y and IL-10 and that a single amino acid mutation can induce temporal changes in this pattern without alterring either the actual cytokines induced or the degree of their elevation. We are currently performing intervention experiments to investigate the effect of intravenous anti-IL-12 andor anti-IFN-alp antibody administration on this early in vivo cytokine response to examine in particular whether these cytokines may be required for the observed elevations in either IFN-y or IL-10. To confirm the importance of the immune system in clearing rotavirus infection we infected Rag 2 knockout mice with murine rotaviruses.

The previously infected mice, as well as naive nude mice, both shed very low but equal levels of rotavirus in the stools. Interestingly adult naive heterozygous littermates shed more virus than the nudes. The factors responsible for this relative resistance of adult nude mice to rotavirus infection as well as the mechanism for viral clearence in nude mice will be discussed. Symp. 1990, 121:149-160) . The great majority of the poxvirus encoded proteins actively mediating the evasion of host defense are secretory proteins termed \"virokines\". Viruses produce proteins which can either compete with or antagonizz molecules critically involved in generating immune responses. The vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) was the first virokine to be reported that has structural similarity to humadmouse complement control proteins, with the greatest similarity to the human complement 4b binding protein (bC4-BP) and the first protein to have a postulated role in the viral evasion of host defense (Kotwal and Moss, Nature 1988, 355:176-179) . Bioactive VCP, purified from serumfree medium has been shown to be more potent than the hC4bBP ( Kotwal, Am. Biotech. Lab., 1994) and has also been shown to bind to two important complement components, C3 and C4, and block the complement cascade at multiple sites in vitro (Kotwal et al., Science 1990, 2502327-830; Mckenzie, Kotwal et al., J. Inf. Dis. 1992 , 1661245-1250 . The importance of this protein was demonstrated in vivo using recombinant virus lacking an intact DNA coding for VCP (Isaacs, Kotwal and Moss, PNAS 1992, 89:628-672) and further underscored by the Smallpox virus genomic sequence analysis, indicating the presence of a highly conserved homolog of VCP ( Massung et al., Nature 1993,366:748-751) . In order to determine the precise effects of VCP at the site of infection, a mouse model has been developed. Measurement of the specific swelling response and microscopic examination of the histological changes in BALB/c and DBN2 mice has revealed that VCP is capable of regulating inflammatory response in vivo (Jayaraman and Kotwal, 1993 Mol. Immunol. 30:20) . In order to ensure that the possiblity of the unrelated mouse strains sharing identical H-2 haplotypes but differing at numerous other loci was not overlooked, we performed similar experiments in congenic strains. Well characterized C5deficient mice injected with poxviruses in comparison to normal mice, produce a significant inflammatory response, accompanied with severe ulceration that persists for several days. The data suggests that the host complement response is a critical factor in Egulating poxvirus pathogenesis. Previous studies have suggested that immune response was one of the major factors that contributed to the host resistantlsusceptible mechanism to Sendai virus infection (Brownstein, 1981) . Various immune regulatory molecules were investigated in inbred susceptible 129/J (129) mice and resistant C57BL/6J (B6) mice which share the same MHC haplotype. When they were given 200 EID, of Sendai virus intranasally, 129 mice showed histologically diffuse interstitial pneumonia compared to the local moderate inflammation in 86 mice. Virus was eliminated from the infected lung 3 days earlier in B6 mice than in 129 mice. The cytokine levels and cytokine-producing cells were investigated in the acute pneumonic lung. Also the recall cytokine production in the draining mediastinal lymph node (MLN) were studied. The maximal numbers of IL-2, IFN-y, IL-10, and IL-4 producing cells were comparable for each strains of mice, while more IL-6 producing cells were present in the lung of 129 mice. However, the numbers of these cytokine producing cells peaked in 129 mice 3 days later than in B6 mice. Analysis of soluble cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed that at least two-fold higher levels of IFN-y, IL-10, and IL-6 were present in 129 mice than in 86 mice. Recall cytokine production in the draining MLN showed only the presence of IL-2, IFN-y, IL-10, and IL-6, while no IL-4 was detected. Generally, higher levels of these cytokines were detected throughout the whole infection process in 129 mice. Therefore, the susceptibility of 129 mice to Sendai virus is not due to insufficient cytokine production in these two anatomical sites, yet heavier and prolonged virus burden in susceptible mice may drive the more rigorous and protracted induction of immune regulatory molecules. Cytokines play a decisive role in determining the type of immune response elicited by an antigen, both in driving Th cell differentiation along Thl or Th2 pathway and, ultimately, the effector and regulatory activity of these subsets. We have studied the role of cytokines in virus infections by constructing recombinant virus vectors encoding cytokine genes. During replication in mice, these vectors produce the encoded factor which is secreted from the infected cells with profound immunological consequences. Cytokines studied todate fall into two categories; either altering viral pathogenesis or selectively stimulating specific immune responses. The expression of IL-2, IFN-y, TNF-a or IL-7 in recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) dramatically alters pathogenicity, such that immunodeficient mice resolve the normally lethal infection. On the other hand, expression of IL-4 by rVV suppresses the induction of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) inhibiting the clearance of virus which leads to an increase in viral pathogenicity. The expression of IL-4 by rVV was shown to inhibit the host IL-2 response required for the development of CTL's. NO production was also significantly suppressed by IL-4. rVVs expressing IL-5 or IL-6, although not affecting pathogenicity, preferentially stimulates IgA reactivity to coexpressed antigens. Encoding cytokines in recombinant viruses has clearly demonstrated the important role of cytokines as anti-viral effector molecules and in regulating appropriate immune responses. In mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), interleukin-I2 (IL-12) doses of >I00 ngld induce profound immunotoxicities characterized as almost complete inhibition of virus-induced CD8+ T cell expansion and CTL activation, and up to 2 log increases in viral replication [Orange, Wolf, and Biron, J. Immunol. 152:1253, 19941 . Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is also observed under these conditions. The studies reported here further characterize the expression and function of TNF in this context. Northern blot and in sifu hybridization analyses demonstrated that IL-12 induced TNF-cx expression and that LCMV infection synergized with IL-12 for this induction. Administration of antibodies neutralizing TNF reversed the IL-12-induced immunotoxicities in LCMV-infected mice and restored anti-viral defenses. The TNF-mediated immunotoxicities appeared to result from an induced cellular sensitivity to the factor, as splenic leukocytes and CD8+ T cells isolated from LCMV-infected mice were more sensitive to TNFmediated cytotoxicity in culture than were equivalent populations prepared from uninfected mice. Additional physiological changes were observed in IL-12-treated uninfected mice and were dramatically elevated in IL-12-treated virus-infected mice, including: 1) decreases in body weights; 2) elevation of circulating glucocorticoid levels: and 3) decreases in thymic mass. These changes were also reversed by anti-TNF.",

Within a few days following infection with LDV there is a pronounced polyclonal activation of B cells followed by the suppression of primary B cell responses to T-dependent Ag. We investigated the effect of acute and persistent LDV infection on the development of a memory B cell response to the model protein antigen, horse cytochrome c (cyt), by employing a modification of the splenic fragment assay. About a 50% decrease in the frequency of responding Agspecific memory B cells was observed in BALB/c mice infected with LDV, whether the mice were immunized with cyt at the time of LDV infection or three weeks later. This may be due in part to a defect in T cell help, since in cultures of normal memory B cells and T cells derived from LDV acutelyinfected mice the frequency of responding B cells was also decreased two-fold. In situ hybridization using a cDNA probe specific for LDV revealed two patterns of LDV RNA within the spleen. Twenty-four hr p.i. LDV RNA was located within the marginal zone, surrounding each follicle. This pattern is consistent with permissive macrophages. During persistence viral RNA could no longer be detected in the marginal zone, but was located within the follicles. The absence of LDV-permissive cells within the follicular region suggests that the source of LDV RNA is not due to ongoing viral replication. One possibility is that circulating virus is trapped by a specific cell population within the follicle. The effect of virus trapping within the spleen provides a mechanism by which LDV and other viruses can modulate immune cell function during persistent infections. IFN-y can be produced by activated NK cells. This cytokine enhances immune responses by augmenting macrophage antigen presentation. Viral infection induces IFN-dp and NK cell activation. Changes in splenic architecture, cell trafficking, and cytokine expression were examined during viral infections of C57BU6 mice. At times coinciding with IFN-dp production and NK cell activation, there was a redistribution of nucleated cells from red pulp to white pulp regions in spleens isolated from mice infected with either lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Cell transfer experiments with dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate-or PKH26-GL-labeled bone marrow cells isolated from normal mice demonstrated an infection-induced accumulation of non-T/non-B cell populations along recipient splenic marginal zones.",

Treatment with anti-AGMI or anti-NK1 .I antibodies eliminated both endogenous NK cells and the IFN-y mRNA positive cells.

Recently there has been the suggestion that immunity to some retroviruses is associated with the production of ceaain patterns of cytokines. To explore this further we have have used Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) infection of C57BU6 (resistant) and BALB/c (susceptible) mice to elucidate the role of cytokines immunity to retroviruses. Initially the in viho proliferation of spleen and lymph node cells from infected mice was examined. In response to stimulation with immohilised anti-CD3 antibodies the proliferation of spleen hut not lymph node cells from infected mice. was found to he rapidly suppressed. Suceptible BALB/c mice exhibited a much greater suppression than resistant C57BU6 mice. The cause of this suppression is under investigation however, the immunosuppressive molecules nitric oxide and prostaglandins are not involved. In vitro cytokine production by spleen and lymph node cells from R-MuLV infected mice was determined. In response to stimulation with immobilised anti-CD3 antibodies, spleen cells from infected BALB/c mice produced diminishing amounts of IFN-7 and IL-2. In contrast spleen cells from infected C57BU6 mice produced IFN-y and L-2 to levels that were only slightly less than uninfected controls. a-6 production by spleen cells from infected mice of both strains was at levels higher uninfected controls. Anti-CD3 stimulated lymph node cells from infected mice produced elevated IFN-1 suggesting that suppressed cytokine production is spleen specific. Expression of cytokine genes in vivo is currently being investigated using RT-PCR to detect cytokine mRNA in the spleens of infected mice. We have previously shown that primary resting murine B lymphocytes are non-permissive for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), however, a productive infection can be induced when infected B cells are activated with anti-immunoglobulin (a-lg) plus IL-4 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We posit VSV in unactivated primary B cells provides a paradigm of persistently infected lymphocytes and activation dependent recall of an active infection. Analysis of the behavior of virus in unstimulated B cells during long term culture and the requirements for subsequent induction of productive infection has been limited by the poor survival of primary cells in culture. We circumvented this limitation by using highly purified small B cells from mice transgenic for the bcl-2 proto-oncogene, expression markedly extends in vitro survival of unstimulated primary B cells. Overexpression of bcl-2 does not alter B cell infection or induction of a productive infection by activators during acute infection. Infection does not effect B cell survival in culture. Unstimulated virus infected B cells produce primary viral mRNAs but not viral proteins or infectious particles (PFU) during culture. Persistently infected B cells stimulated with a-lg plus IL-4 produced a fully productive VSV infection at all times analyzed, up to 3 weeks post infection. In contrast, VSV production in persistently infected B cells activated with LPS markedly declined relative to acutely infected activated cells (50-1 00 fold by week 1 and 1,000 fold by week 2). Cells were not completely refractory to LPS activation as VSV protein was produced. The selective LPS deficiency is unique to persistently infected cells as uninfected cultured B cells proliferate and differentiate to produce antibody upon LPS activation. These data show that a persistent infection may selectively alter the host cell response to previously productive activators which may as a consequence interfere with immune regulation.",

BALB/C mice were immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing either RSV-fusion glycoprotein ( VAC-F), attachment glycoprotein (VAC-G) or 8-galactosidase (as a control). These mice were given RSV intranasally three weeks after priming and then sacrificed 5 or 14 days later. Spleens and bronchial lymph nodes were harvested for in vitro culture and lungs were harvested for histologic studies . We found that bulk cultures obtained from both VAC-F and VAC-G immunized animals secreted both Thl and Th2 type cytokines when stimulated with RSV infected spleen cells . However, the levels of 11-5 and 1FN-y were higher in bulk cultures derived from VAC-G primed animals while the levels of IL-2 were higher in the bulk culture from VAC-F primed animals. The IL-4 and IL-5 production was relatively short lived since spleen cells and bronchial lymph node cells obtaind form mice sacrificed 14 days after intranasal inoculation produced much lower levels of IL-4 and 11-5 while the levels of IL-2 and IFN-y production were comparable to bulk cultures obtained from mice at the peak of infection. There was little inflammatory response in the lungs obtained from mice immunized with the control vaccinia.",

            "text": "In contrast , lungs from mice immunized with VAC-F or VAC-G showed significant infiltration of inflammatory cells. There was a striking infiltration of eosinophils in the lungs from mice primed with VAC-G. These eosinophils could be detected aroud major bronchi and blood vessels, as well as, in some cases, in lung parenchyma. This study suggests that the immune responses to different viral glycoproteins may be distinct and may play important roles in viral pathogenesis. During infection of normal mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), NK cell responses peak on day 3 and subside as CD8+ T cell responses are activated at day 7 post-infection. In contrast, 02M-/-mice, lacking CD8+ T cells, have dramatically elevated NK cell responses on day 7 postinfection. The 02M-/-response is evidenced by increased NK cell activity, as well as up to 5-fold increases in blast and total NKI.I+CD3-cell numbers. NK cell responses in normal mice are cyclosporin A (CsA)-resistant and interleukin (IL)-2independent, whereas day 7 NK cell responses in 02M-/-mice are CsA-sensitive and IL-2-dependent. To investigate the role of additional cytokines in regulating cellular responses during acute viral infections, production and function of IL-4 and transforming growth factor4 (TGF-0) were examined. Induction of IL-4 mRNA, at late times post-infection of normal mice, was shown by in situ hybridization of T cell-enriched splenic leukocytes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of cDNA from RNA. ELlSAs of media cor.aitioned with cells isolated on days 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 14 post-infection demonstrated delayed induction of IL-4 protein as compared to CTL activation. TGF-0, evaluated in biological and ELISA assays, was induced maximally at days 7 to 9 post-infection. The kinetics of TGF-0 production by cells from infected 82M-/mice was similar to that of normal mice. However, cells from 02M-/-mice produced IL-4 at early but not at late times postinfection. Together, these results suggest that either IL-4 is a critical cytokine for shutting off NK cells during normal responses to viral infection, or that the 02M-l context modulates responsiveness of NK cell subsets to other late cytokines. Studies are in progress to distinguish between these two possible mechanisms. The induction of fever in response to infection is an important host defense mechanism that enhances aspects of the immune response and restricts the replication of some microorganism. Vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family, is a complex cytoplasmic DNA virus that encodes a variety of proteins that interfere with host immune functions, such as complement regulatory factors and soluble receptors for IL-lp, TNF and IFNy.",

            "text": "These results represent the first example of a virus mechanism to inhibit the host febrile response and suggest a central role for soluble IL-lp in the induction of fever in poxvirus infections. Measles virus (MV) infection can depress cell-mediated immune responses for months following clinical disease. MV is known to infect the thymus during human illness and this may contribute to immune suppression. We have used the SCID-hu m o w with co-implants of human fetal thymus and liver to determine the effect of virulent and avirulent strains of MV on the thymus. SCID-hu mice were. infected by direct inoculation of the graft with 103 PFU of either a wild type strain of MV(Chicago-1,Chi-1) or an attenu-ated strain (Moraten, Mor) and sacrificed at intervals over 28 days. Peak viral titers, as judged by plaque assay on Vero cells, were reached by Chi-1 on d4 (105.7 PFU/ third of implant), and Moron d21 (103.2 PFU/ third of implant). Hematoxylideosin stained sections of Chi-1-infected thymuses showed marked distortion of the cortex and medulla by d4 with thymocyte poilolosis and decreased cellularity. By d14, these. implants were mostly devoid of normal thymocytes. Mor-infected thymuses showed relatively preserved architecture and cellularity. Suspensions of the cells from implants stained with mAbs to CD3,CD4 and CD8 were analyzed by flow cytomehy. There were significant decreases in the CD4+CD8+ cell pop-ulation by d10 with complete loss of all such cells by d28 with Chi-1, and only modest reductions with Mor. Immune fluorescence staining of sections with a MV mAb to hemagluttinin(HA) and Abs for either human cytokera-tins(AEl/AE3) or CD15 co-localized MV predominantly to epithelial and monocytic cells. Additionally, MV antigen was present diffusely by d4 in both cortex and medulla in Chi-I infection whereas Mor-infected implants had only patchy distribution by d21. Only rare cells stained both with MV HA and CD2 or CD4. MV HA was not expressed over background on any CD4+ cells judged by FACS. We conclude that MV replicates in the SCID-hu thymic implant primarily in epithelial and monocytic cells, and that the attenuated virus reproduces more slowly and with less cellular disruption. Little MV HA could be demonstrated in thymocytes, therefore the data suggest that significant infection of the thymic epithelial stroma disrupts the thymic microenvironment which normally supports and aids in selection of immature T cells. Part of the long-term immune suppression seen in MV infection may be due to infection of the thymic epithelial stroma with subsequent loss of thymocytes. It is becoming increasingly evident that many poxviruses contain genes that enable the virus to evade the host's immune system. Myxoma virus is a leporipoxvirus and is the causative agent of myxomatosis, a rapidly lethal disease in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). One possible mechanism of immune evasion is virus-induced downregulation of cell-surface receptors important for an immune response. Cell-surface levels of several receptors on a rabbit T cell lymphoma cell line (RL-5) were monitored by flow cytometry. Following infection with Myxoma virus, cellsurface levels of CD4 were found to drop dramatically. Other cell surface antigens such as CD18, CD43, and CD45 were unaffected during infection with myxoma virus. Further more, the downregulation of CD4 by myxoma virus could be inhibited by treating cells for an extended period of time with PMA, suggesting that the downregulation was not simply a masking of the epitope via viral antigens. Analysis of CD4 levels in the presence of cytosine arabinoside indicates that late gene expression is not necessary for the modulation. Since the tyrosine specific protein kinase p56lck associates with the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 we have also examined the association of p56lck with CD4 as well as steady state levels of p56lCk during viral infection. The modulation of surface CD4 has also been described in HIV infected T cells suggesting that the loss of cell-surface CD4 may be a common viral immune evasion tactic by lymphotrophic viruses. I n addition, stably-transfected cell l i n e s expressing e i t h e r U S 1 1 o r US2-6 gene products s i g n i f i c a n t l y reduced l e v e l s of MHC class I heavy chain.

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) may play a significant role in containing the spread of HIV in infected individuals. Although HIV-infection is associated with immune suppression, a vigorous CTL response has been detected in infected adults. HIV can be transmitted from mother to child. One third of vertically infected children has a rapid evolution toward disease, with onset of AIDS before 18 months. The other two thirds remain asymptomatic for years. The bimodal course of disease evolution in HIV-infected children could be related to differences in the host immune control of viral replication.",

We, as well as others. have proposed that Sag function is critical to the ability of milk-borne M M N to infect mice. To determine whether this is the case, we created transgenic mice (HYB PRO/Cla) with a frameshift mutation int the sag gene. Young HYB PRO/Cla mice (c 10 weeks of age) showed no deletion of their cognate Vp14* T cells, unlike transgenic mice carrying a functional sag gene However, a slow, progressive loss was seen in the HYB PROlCla mice as they aged, indicating that it was due to expression of wild type Sag protein. Thus, as the HYB PRO/Cla mice aged, there was production of virus that appeared to lose the Cla mutation. The HYB PRO/Cla mice produced transgene RNA in their lactating mammary gland and shed virus in their milk. Their nontransgenic offspring of showed infection with transgene-encoded MMTV because they had the typical slow deletion of Vp14+ T cells characteristic of C3H MMTV infection and because we detected transgene-derived M M N RNA in their mammary glands. Cloning and sequencing of the viral RNA produced by the nontransgenic offspring of the HYB PRO/Cla mice showed that recombination between the Mtv-1 endogenous viral RNA and the transgene-encoded RNA occurred, such that the frameshift introduced by the Cia mutation was repaired.",

In order to understand the cellular immune response against HBV in chronic HBV infection, T cell proliferation, cytotoxicity and cytokine production were studied. We found that although the majority of asymptomatic HBsAg carriers and patients of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) had no proliferative response to HBsAg, some individuals in both groups showed significant T cell proliferation against HBsAg. In contrast, the proliferative T cell response to HBcAg in asyrnpatomatic HBsAg carriers was significantly stronger than that in patients of CHB with acute exacerbation. In addition, the frequency of HBcAg-reactive T cell precursors measured by limiting dilution assay was much higher in asymptomatic HBsAg carriers than in patients of CHB. Therefore, T cell responses against HBsAg and HBcAg are regulated differently in chronic HBV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated HBsAg-and HBcAg-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in asymptomatic HBsAg carriers, using autologous HBsAg-and HBcAg-expressing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) as target cells, respectively. The cloned CTL were able to produce IFN-y, TNF-a or GM-CSF after stimulation. These findings demonstrate that T cell response to HBV is not completely suppressed in asymptomatic HBsAg carriers.

The promoter contains a TATA box 30 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, binding sites for several pol I1 transcription factors, and long poly A+ RNA is synthesized from the integrated HTLV-I proviral DNA in vivo. Consistent with these characteristics, HTLV-I transcription activity was reconstituted in v i m using TBP, TFIIA, rTFIIB, rTFIIE, rTFIIF, TFIIH and pol 11. In HeLa whole cell extracts, however, the HTLV-I LTR also contains an overlapping transcription unit (OTU). HTLV-I OTU transcription is initiated at the same nucleotide site as the RNA isolated from the HTLV-I-infected cell line, MT-2, but was not inhibited by the presence of a-amanitin at concentrations which inhibited the adenovirus major late pol I1 promoter (6 pglml). HTLV-I transcription was inhibited when higher concentrations of a-amanitin were used (60 pglml), in the range of a typical polymerase In (pol 111) promoter (VA-I). Purified Tax, transactivates this promoter 5-to 10-fold in v i m . Interestingly, basal and Tax,-transactivated transcriptional activity of the HTLV-I LTR could be reconstituted with the 0.5 M phosphocellulose fraction. These observations suggest that the HTLV-I LTR contains overlapping Tax,responsive promoters, a typical pol I1 promoter and a unique pol I11 promoter which requires a distinct set of transcription factors. Tax, further in vifro transactivates a polymerase I1 template containing the 21 base pair repeats cloned upstream of the ovalbumin promoter and G-free cassette. Tax,-transactivated transcription was concentration dependent and inhibited by low concentrations of a-amanitin. Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses whose route of infection is via the skin. They are mostly neurotropic and responsible for significant human morbidity and mortality. The classic cell-mediated immune response to a viral infection may be influenced by the ability of these viruses to modify expression of cell-surface molecules involved in the presentation of antigen to, and activation of, T cells. The skin Langerhans cell is the prototypic nonlymphoid dendritic cell and as such is uniquely placed to participate in a response against epidermally-acquired viral infections. The migratory properties of these cells contribute to their role as initiators of T cell-mediated immune responses within the draining lymph node. We have previously shown infection of epidermal cells in vifro by the flavivirus West Nile (WNV) results in an increase in MHC class I and I1",

Tme-dependent increases in the surface expression of a number of antigens which are involved either directly or in a co-stimulatory capacity in initiating a cell-mediated immune response, were detected on both the majority of epidermal cells and the Langerhans cell population using flow cytometry. These increases were detectable as early as 16 hours after infection. A significant decrease in the percentage of Langerhans cells remaining in the epidermis was observed within 48 hours of infection. The phenotypic changes observed in vivo are analogous to those described following in vifro culture of Langerhans cells. These results, together with the reduction in Langerhans cell numbers, may represent the in situ maturation and concomitant migration of these. cells as a consequence of virus-induced cytokines within the skin microenvironment. which cause a wide variety of illnesses with high morbidity and mortality in humans throughout the world. Their high genomic stability argues for a survival strategy related more to interaction with the vertebrate host immune response, than a dependence on viral genetic mutation. Our previous work has shown that West Nile Virus (WNV) infection of many cell types directly induces functional increases in class I and 11 MHC expression. We report here that WNV infection of human embryonic fibroblasts (HEF) results in the increased expression of CD54 by two distinct mechanisms. An early, direct cytokine-independent mechanism operates within 2 h of virus infection, while an indirect mechanism, regulated by type 1 interferon (IFN), operates within 24 h of virus infection. CD54 expression increased by 4-5 fold within 2h of WNV infection on HEF, and by 6-7-fold within 24h. WNV-inactivated, conditioned supematants removed from infected HEF cultures after 4 h incubation did not alter CD54 expression on unqimulated HEF. whereas conditioned supernatants from 24 h-infected Cultures increased CD54 expression by about 1.5-2-fold after incubation for 24 h, but not after 4 h, similar to CD54 induction by 200Ulml of IFN-p. Increased CD54 expression on HEF by WNV was also cell-cycle dependent. CD54 increased only in quiescent, contact-inhibited infected HEF in Go phase. In contrast, induction of CD54 by types 1 and 2 IFN was not cell-cycle dependent. Other viruses, including double-stranded DNA viruses, vaccinia, and adenovirus 2 and 5, and the single, positive-stranded RNA alphavirus, Semiliki Forest virus, did not induce CD54 expression on HEF after 24 h. Another alphavirus, Ross river, was able to induce CD54 but only by the indirect mechanism of type 1 IFN-dependent release. Poly I.C, also, increased CD54 expression to the same extent as IFN-p after 24 h, making it unlikely that the early increase was due to a nonspecific viral effect. The closely related flavivirus, Kunjin, induced increased CD54 expression in a manner similar to WNV. The ability of flavivhses to induce increased CD54 expression directly within a few hours of infection may be an important virus-host survival strategy promoting cell-cell adhesion and hence possible further viral infectiodreplication. Recognition of viral peptides presented on the cell surface in association with class I MHC molecules leads to lysis by cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and forms an important part of the immune response to HIV infection. HIV virus has a high mutation rate and variation in the region of the viral epitope may allow evasion of this immune response. Variation could theoretically affect processing of the antigen, binding of the epitope to the HLA molecule or recognition of the presented epitope on the cell surface. We have studied proviral sequence variation in gag and CTL responses in a number of HLA B8 patients infected with HIV. Amino acid substitutions, such as a lysine to arginine change at position 3 of the PI7 gag nonamer CCKKKYKLK, lead to loss of recognition of the peptide by CTL from the patient whose provirus contained this sequence. These variant peptides bind to HLA 68 with comparable affinity to the index peptide suggesting that this loss of recognition is likely to be caused by changes in the interaction between the HLA-peptide complex and the T cell receptor. Other changes, such as lysine to arginine or glutamine at position 7, not only cause loss of recognition, but also lead to inhibition of lysis of targets bearing the index peptide. Thus it appears that in addition to loss of recognition by cytotoxic T cells, naturally occurring epitope variants may act as \"antagonists\", as has been demonstrated in MHC class II systems. Antagonism may be an important mechanism allowing immune escape by the HIV virus. genes. Subsequent complex formation between peptide, class I and p2microglobulin in the ER results in stable cell surface expression of the trimeric MHC-1 molecule. In previous studies we showed that in HPV-16 positive cervical carcinomas there was a loss of MHC-1 protein expression, which correlated at the single cell level with loss of TAP protein.",

Western blots showed very low steady state levels of TAP-1 and MHC-1 heavy chains in the cells with pAT16 as well as those containing ES alone, which was marginally increased by y-lFN. In contrast, primary keratinocytes, pAT16ESX and pUC.ET16 lines showed comparable TAP-1 and MHC-1 protein levels, which increased a & y-IFN treatment. Northem blots showed no differences in the amounts of TAP-1 and MHC-1 mRNA between the different cell lines. The data indicate that expression ofHF'V-16 E5 leads to post-transcriptional loss of MHC-1, presumably by interfering with TAP.

At least two regions within the first exon of Ad12 E1A were identified which influenced tumorigenicity. This study further examines the role of these regions in tumorigenicity by analyzing their affect on cell surface MHC class I expression and sensitivity to class I-restricted CD8+ as well as to non-class Irestricted NKS. The BCRFl open reading frame of Epstein-Barr virus exhibits remarkable sequence homology with the coding sequences of interleukin-10 from a variety of organisms.

The inhibitor was produced early in infection and did not inhibit IFNy. The IFNa/p inhibitor was mapped and the gene expressed from recombinant baculovirus. The inhibitor blocked the binding of 125I-IFNa to U937 cells and binding of 125I-IFNa to supernatants from baculovirus and VV-infected cells demonstrated that the inhibitor functioned as a soluble receptor for 1FNc1fp. Direct binding of 1251-IFNa to VV WR supernatants revealed that the soluble IFNa/p receptor had a high affinity for type I IFN. Deletion of the gene from the VV genome and ligand blotting of the soluble receptor demonstrated that IFN binding was encoded by a single protein. Competitive binding curves using IFNa from other species revealed that the poxvirus soluble IFNdp receptor bound human and bovine IFN with high affinity but murine IFN with relatively low affmity. Interestingly, the soluble IFNcrip receptor is highly conserved in variola virus. Given the importance of IFN in antiviral defense it is likely that the soluble IFNdp receptor plays an important role in the virulence of the orthopoxviruses. Endogenous processing of a viral glycoprotein for presentation t o CD4+ T cells has defined a previously under-investigated pathway in antigen processing and presentation. It may be important not only for pathogens, but also for self-proteins, and thus may be involved in self-tolerance. We have been characterizing the processing o f the ER-restricted Gpt glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) biochemically and enzymatically, by cellular localization using confocal immunofluorescence, cellular fractionation, and by T cell recognition assays. By flow cytometry, Gpt is undetected on the plasma membrane; in contrast, the wild type protein (G) is readily found following infection of A20 cells with a vaccinia virus vector, leading t o endogenous synthesis. The Gpt can be found exclusively in the ER compartment using co-localization with markers for ER (signal peptide binding protein, calnexin), and not in the Golgi compartment (a-mannosidase 11, wheat germ agglutinin), endosome, lysosome, or surface plasma membrane. This is consistent with the characteristics o f the localization of the proteases which appear to be responsible for its degradation. Work is in progress to localize the site of peptide binding to MHC heterodimers.",

The E3/19K protein of human adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) is a resident transmembrane glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Its capacity to associate with class I histocompatibility (MHC) antigens abrogates cell surface expression and the antigen presentation function of MHC antigens. At present, it is unclear exactly which structure of the E3/19K protein mediates binding to MHC molecules. Apart from a stretch of approximately 20 conserved amino acids in front of the transmembrane segment, E3/19K molecules from different adenovirus subgroups (B and C) share little homology. Remarkably, the majority of cysteines is conserved. In this report, we examined the importance of cysteine residues (Cys) for structure and function of the Ad2 E3/19K protein. We show that E3/19K contains intramolecular disulfide bonds. By using sitedirected rnutagenesis, individual cysteines were substituted by serines and alanines, and mutant proteins were stably expressed in 293 cells. Based on the differential binding of monoclonal antibody Tw1.3 and cyanogen bromide cleavage experiments, a structural model of E3/19K is proposed, in which Cys 11 and Cys 28 as well as Cys 22 and Cys 83 are linked by disulfide bonds. Both disulfide bonds (all four cysteines) are absolutely critical for the interaction with human MHC antigens. This was demonstrated by three criteria: loss of E3/19K coprecipitation, lack of transport inhibition and normal cell surface expression of MHC molecules in cells expressing mutant E3/19K molecules. Mutation of the three other cysteines at position 101, 109 and 122 had no effect. This indicates that a conformational determinant based on two disulfide bonds is crucial for the function of the E3/19K molecule, namely, to bind and to inhibit transport of MHC antigens. Previous studies have suggested that several abundant CMV proteins are major immunogenic targets in seropositive adults. We are interested in defining the major viral protein targets of a CD8' CTL response, in order to derive a vaccine strategy for individuals who are unable to mount immune responses which are lymphokinedependent because of immunosuppression. HLA-typed and CMV-pgsitive normal volunteers who have HLA-A alleles that represent -75% of the U.S. population are being tested to determine which of 5 abundant CMV proteins they recognize by a CD8' CTL response: p28, p65, p150, IE, and gB. T cell lines will be derived in order to unambiguously determine the HLA restriction of the CD8' CTL response to each of these proteins. Proteins which are recognized by the most HLA diverse population will be further characterized in terms of mapping of Class 1 epitopes through the use of T cell clones derived from the polyclonal cell lines by limiting dilution. The defined epitopes will form the basis of a vaccine strategy to augment the memory responses of seropositive volunteers against CMV. These epitopes will be used to boost the CTL precursor frequency of bone marrow transplant donors as a means to transfer cellular immunity to immunosuppressed hematologic transplant recipients. An alternative strategy is to immunize seropositive individuals with recombinant viral proteins as a means to boost immunologic memory. We are pursuing that strategy in a transgenic murine model of HLA-A2.1 developed by Dr. L. Sherman (Scripps Institute, La Jolla). We are vaccinating the transgenic mice with two well defined CMV proteins, p65 and gB together with either of two lipid-based adjuvants, commercially available D0TAPm (Bcehringer-Mannheim) or MF5gTH (Chiron, Emeryville, CA). Our preliminary studies with HSV-2 gB demonstrate that both adjuvants are effective at eliciting murine Class I restricted responses against the protein. Current studies are evaluating the recognition properties of the adjuvant-CMV protein complexes by HWA2 as a restriction element in the transgenic model.

Preliminary data showed there generally appeared to be dominant recognition of Glyp4 and Asnm. However, individual hybridomas exhibited distinct patterns of fine specificity for residues PheP1 and AlaPs. Thus, individual hybridomas were dependent on one, both, or neither of these residues for recognition of SEV-9. These data are consistent with a critical role for the GI94 and A d 5 in governing TCR-SEV-9Eb recognition and suggest a structural basis for the diversity of the TCR repertoire selected by this @tope. Previous results from this laboratoty demonstrated that the dominant influenza A epitope recognized by HLA42.1 restricted CTL from HLA-A2.1 uansgenic mice was the M1 peptide epitope that is immunodominant in human CTL responses. However, analysis of a large number of CTL lines revealed a subset of influenza A/pR/8/34-specific murine CTL that recognized an HLA-A2.1 restricted epitope distinct from M1. Using recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding Werent influenza gene segments, the epitope recognized by these CTL was shown to be derived from the A/PR/8 NSl protein. Because these CTL did not recognize targets infected with the A/Alaska/6/77 saain of influenza, candidate peptide epitopes were synthesized based on sequences that included an HLA-A2.1 specific binding motif and that differed between A/PW and NAlaska All of these CTL recognized a nonamer and a decamer peptide which contained a common 8 amino acid sequence and two distinct sets of bmding mtif residues. However, the n0name.r peptide was able to sensitize CTL for half maximal lysis at 80-2500 fold lower doses than either the octamer or decamer. The homologous peptide derived from NAlaska NSl contained conservative amino acid changes at positions 4 and 8 and was not recognized at any tested concentration, although it bound with higher &ity to HLA-A2.1 than the peptide from A/PW8. The A/pR/8 NSl nonamer epitope was also recognized by human influenza A specific CTL derived from two individuals.

Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Immunology, The Babraham Institute, Cambs CB2 4AT, UK. Tap transporters from rats can be divided into two allelic groups, depending on their capacity to provide the RT1.Aa molecule with an appropriate level of suitable peptidesl. Recent results suggest that this might correlate with the RT1.Aa molecule requiring arginine-ended peptides (Powis et al., manuscript submitted), which the Tapb allele of the transporter is unable to translocate across the ER membrane efficiently2~3. RT1.A alleles are naturally linked with the Tapa or the Tapb allelic group4. We have set out to characterise various alleles for the RT1.A molecule, and find that, for the majority of TAPaassociated RT1.A molecules, 3 acidic residues line the C/E pocket, dictating Arginine as C-terminal anchor residue for the bound peptides. On the other hand, in Tapb-associated RT1.A molecules, one acidic residue at the most is found in the C/E pocket, which certainly results in a different anchor residue for the bound peptides. The selective pressure of viral infections must have driven this coevolution which affects dramatically the array of peptides presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in HIV infection can be impaired due to variation in the epitope regions of viral proteins such as gag. We show here an analysis of variant epitope peptides in three gag epitopes presented by HLA B8. Seventeen variant peptides were examined for their binding to HLA B8; all but one bind at concentrations comparable to known epitopes. All except two could be seen by CTL clones grown from HLA B8 positive HIV-1 infected patients and were therefore immunogenic. However, in one haemophiliac patient studied in detail, there was a failure to respond to some of the peptides that represented virus present as provirus in his peripheral blood. In one case his CTL had previously responded to the peptide. Thus there was a selective failure of the CTLresponse to variant epitopes. This impaired reaction to new variants and failure to maintain responses to some epitopes late in HIV infection could contribute to the loss of immune control of the infection.",

These clones were CD8+ and class I HLArestricted by the B7 molecule. All three clones recognized lllB and RF but not MN strains of HIV-1. Using vaccinia vectors expressing truncated versions of the HIV-1 envelope, the clones were found to recognize an epitope within amino acids 287-364, but not including 312-328 of gp120. Further mapping of the epitope with synthetic 20-mer peptides overlapping by 10, or 25-mers overlapping by 8, was unsuccessful. The sequence of the region of gp120 recognized by these clones was compared to the predicted HLA-87 peptide binding motif and a possible matching region was found. Using shorter peptides corresponding to this potential epitope recognition site, the minimum epitope recognized by the clones was determined to be the 10 aa sequence RPNNNTRKSI spanning amino acids We have further pursued a strategy to define a minimal cytotoxic epitope for a vaccine against CMV infection using T cell clones derived from individuals who have the MHC 835 gene (kind gifts of Drs. Riddell and Greenberg, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Dr. Robert Siliciano, Johns Hopkins University Medical Center). We tested by chromium release assay (CRA) the recognition of a series of 835 allelic variants of EBV-LCL. by 835 restricted and CMV or HIV-specific T cell clones. Several conclusions quickly became apparent. The previously described 8'3501 peptide epitope from pp65 was not able to prime the autologous 835 EBV-LCL for killing by the pp65-specific CTL, whereas a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing whole pp65 could cause the same cell line to be recognized and killed in the same experiment. In addition, an HIV gp41-specific CD8' CTL which has a defined minimal cytotoxic epitope will only recognize and kill a subset of 835 EBV-LCL. The two T cell clones will not recognize each other's autologous EBV-LCL. The resolution of this interesting phenomena comes from sequence analysis of the HLA Class I B genes from both EBV-LCL. EBV-LCL which contain the B'3502 allele are recognized and killed by the pp65-specific T cell clone, and cell lines carrying 8'3501 alleles are recognized by the HIV gp41-T cell clone. We conclude that the reported CMV pp65 B\"3501 restricted epitope is not correct, since the CTL in question will only recognize 6'3502 alleles in combination with the correct pp65 epitope. fragments with or without a signal sequence sensitize RMA-S/Kd to a similar limited extent. This data i s consistent with an inefficient movement of peptides from the cytoplasm into the ER by a Tap independent mechanism and does not reveal a processing competent compartment within the secretory pathway. Peptide transport by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) was studied using a microsome system as previously reported by Heemels et. al.. In this system, a radiolabeled synthetic peptide which can be N-link glycosylated is used as the indicator peptide for the transport studies. The transport efficiency of synthetic peptides corresponding to antigenic peptides restricted to the murine Kd molecule was measured by inhibition of labeled peptide transported into the microsomes. The transport efficiency of three Kd epitopes in the type A influenza virus \"147-155, HA204-212 and HA210-219 was found to be similar. An 11 amino acid peptide corresponding to HA204-214 which contains the 204-212 epitope was transported at a similar efficiency as the 9 amino acid minimum epitope. However, when the peptide sequence is further extended by one amino acid to residue 215, this peptide is poorly transported. These results suggest that the flanking region of an epitope can dramatically influence the transport of the epitope. When the transport kinetics of TAP was studied using the microsome system, the Vmax for transporting the indicator peptide (a variant of NP epitope that has the sequence TYNRTRALI) was found at 260.8 fmolelminute (+/-30.5). The Km for this peptide was found to be 231.9nM(+/-31.8).",

Thomas Jeferson Universitv. hiladelphia, PA., 19107. Previous work from our laboratory showed that processing of an influenza nucleoprotein (NP) epitope (amino acids 147-155) expressed endogenously from a recombinant vaccinia virus \"minigene\" is severely impaired when a flanking sequence (the dipeptide threonine-glycine) is appended to the Cterminus of the construct (147-158/R-). The inhibition of processing is overcome by placing the unprocessed peptide in the context of the fulllength NP molecule, demonstrating that regions of a protein outside the epitope itself critically affect the ability of the proteolytic machinery to fragment the protein appropriately. To determine the requirements for bypassing the block in antigen processing, we have constructed an array of \"minigene\"-expressing vaccinia recombinants in which the unprocessed epitope is extended by varying lengths toward either the C-terminus or the N-terminus of the NP molecule. Our results show that while an extension of the C-terminus by only one amino acid restores processability, a much longer extension of the N-terminus (75 < n < 100 amino acids) will also allow the substrate to be processed. It is therefore clear that a full-length, properly folded molecule is not required for liberation of the blocked epitope, and that probably more than one mechanism can contribute to enhancement of substrate proteolysis. We hypothesize that the C-terminal extension allows recruitment of an endopeptidase versus exopeptidase (\"trimming\") activity which is capable of cleaving the difficult bond. We considered the possibility that the N-terminal extension rescues processing by recruitment of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation system. To address this possibility we replaced all available ubiquitination sites (lysine residues) in one of the rescued constructs (50-158/R-) to see if the construct would still be processed and presented. The six available lysine residues were changed to arginine using PCR-based mutagenesis. The resulting construct (termed 6R) was recombined into vaccinia virus and tested for presentation to NP-specific CTL. The 6R construct was presented at a level equivalent to that seen with the wild-type 50-158/Rconstruct. This result provides clear evidence that entry into the ubiquitindependent degradation pathway is not responsible for rescue of presentation in this system and more importantly, that ubiquitination is not required for processing of all large substrates.",

Dengue virus (DEN) can cause dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) I dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and DEN-2 was the most common serotype found in DHF outbreaks globally. Current hypotheses suggested that DHF may be associated either with antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) or with viral virulence. DEN can replicate predominantly in monocytedmacrophages (MIM), but whether peripheral blood lymhocytes (PBLs) are the target cells of DEN still remain controversial. In order to compare whether various clinically derived DEN-2 will interact with MIM and lymphocytes in different manners, we used two isolates --PLO46 strain (obtained from a DF patient during Taiwan 1981 outbreaks) and 16681 strain (isolated from a DHF patient in Thailand by CDC, USA) to infect primary MIM and lymphocytes as well as several types of cell lines. Primary lymphocyte culture was nonadherent cells obtained after 24 hr adherence of PBMCs, whereas the primary MIM culture was collected by depletion of lymphocytes using anti-CD3ICDI9 mAb and complement prior to adherence procedure and the purity of MIM culture was checked by CD14 surface marker staining. Supernatants (SN) of virus were harvested at various time points post infection after with several or without treatments. Our prelimanary data showed that DHF-associated DEN-2 strain had higher viral yield in certain age of MIM and a promonocytic cell line (HL-CZ) than Taiwan DF-associated DEN2 strain. In addition, this DHF-DEN2 strain was more likely to infect the promonocytic (HL-CZ) than well differentiated monocytic (CTV-1) and lymphocytic (H9) cell lines and also had higher peak yields than DEN-I virus in HL-CZ cells. Interestingly, DHF-DEN2 strain replicated much more efficiently in primary lymphocytes no matter these cells were activated with PHA or not, whereas Taiwan DF-DEN2 strain virus was hardly detectable in SN of both activated and non-activated lymphocyte cultures. Therefore we conclude that (1) different strains of dengue virus could orchestrate quite differently with immune cells, (2) different stage of MIM differentiation might be an important permissive determinants for dengue virus infection and replication, and (3) DEN virus strain virulence -a more important factor than lymphocyte activation status -seemed to determine whether this strain would infect human PBLs. Further studies should be focused on searching for detaied mechanisms of virus and immune cell interactions. (2) when viral yields were enhanced early than day5 post infection, it provided tremendous opportunity to attack the immune system and finally may lead to severe disease.",

Primary isolates of HIV-1 have been shown to be less sensitive to neutralization by immune sera, monoclonal antibodies and CD4-based molecules than T cell line-adapted strains of HIV-I. We studied two immunoglobulin molecules for ability to neutralize primary isolates of HIV-I. lgG12 is an immunoglobulin molecule created from a combinatorial phage expression library and reacts with the CD4 binding site (CD4-BS) on gp120. CD4-lgG2 is a recombinant molecule in which the variable domains of both heavy and light chains of lgG2 were replaced with the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains of human CD4. Both molecules have been previously shown to effectively neutralize HIV-I in vitro. Ex vivo neutralizations were performed as follows: lgG12 and CD4-lgG2 were added at 25 pg/ml to wells containing serial dilutions of plasma from HIV-I-infected patients and PHAstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seronegative donors. P24 production was measured over 14 days of culture and an end-point titer of HIV-1 in the presence and absence of added antibody was determined. Both IgG12 and CD4-lgG2 were found to reduce the original HIV titer from seven plasma samples with high virus titer (>250 TCID50/ml) by up to 625-fold. This is in comparison to soluble CD4 which only reduced viral infectivity by 55-fold at the same concentration. In vitro binding and neutralization assays on isolates recovered from plasma confirm the potency and breadth of neutralization by these two molecules. These studies suggest that recombinant antibodies directed at the CD4-BS of HIV-1 gp120 are able to effectively neutralize primary isolates of HIV-1 and may be useful in dissecting the mechanisms of resistance to neutralization by other antibodies.",

Previously, we showed that HIV-1 proteins conjugated to 8. abortus (BA) could generate anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies in mice even after depletion of CD4* T cells. In this study a 14-mer peptide from the V3 loop of HIV-1 (MN) was synthesized 013) and coupled to BA and KLH. BALB/c mice were immunized twice i.p. with these conjugates at two week intervals. V3-KLH induced mainly IgG1, whereas V3-BA induced all IgG isotypes but lgG2a predominated. Fecal extracts from mice immunized with V3-BA were shown by ELSA to contain IgA antibodies. Sera from these mice bound gp120, expressed on the surface of infected cells. Sera from mice immunized with V3-BA inhibited syncytia formed between CD4' T cells and chronically infected [HIV-I (MN)] H9 cells. Inhibition of syncytia, formed by other HIV-1 lab. strains correlated with the degree of their homology with the V3 region of HIV-I (MN). To mimic the efffect of HIV-1, mice were depleted of CD4' cells using anti-L3T4 at the time of primary or secondary immunization. Following primary immunization, CD4+ T cell depletion abrogated V3-KLH antibody responses, whereas responses to V3-BA were retained and sera from these mice were able to inhibit gp-120mediated syncytia. In secondary responses, CD4' T cell-depletion prevented boosting to V3-KLH, but V3-BA increased anti43 and syncytia-inhibiting antibodies. These results suggest that: 1. 8. abortus, can provide carrier function for a peptide and induce both serum and mucosal antibody responses, and 2. that infection with HIV-1 with subsequent impairment of CD4' T cell function would not abrogate anti-HIV-1 antibody responses if 8. abortus is used as a carrier to stimulate memory responses. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the VH genes revealed the usage of one particular VH germline element (VH61-1P) in all clones. This finding allowed the determination of somatically mutated positions in the VH regions. Two VSV-IND neutralizing antibodies expressed VH and VL genes in complete germline configuration whereas the rest of the clones showed somatic mutations which obviously were antigen dependently selected for. However, binding affinities of mutated and unmutated antibodies were comparably high. In order to determine the influence of somatic point mutations on one single antibody we generated a monovalent single chain antibody (FV-CK) of a mutated clone and reversed it stepwise to germline configuration by means of site directed mutagenesis. Surprisingly, already the germline configuration of FV-CK could neutralize VSV-IND, even though the binding affinty was lower than that of the mutated FV-CK. Every single somatic point mutation tested improved the binding avidity although some mutations reduced affinity. Thus, during the course of VSV-IND infection some antibodies are subjected to avidity maturation although this is not required for the generation of high affme, efficiently virus neutralizing antibodies,",

The B and T cell responses in C57BL/6J(B6) mice treated with the mAb Mel-14 to L-selectin have been analysed following i.n. infection with Sendai virus. Mel-14 treatment caused a 70-90% decrease in the lymphocyte recruitment to the mediastinal (h4LN) and cervical (CLN) lymph nodes following infection with Sendai virus. The cellularity of the spleen was unchanged. The clonal expansion of CD8+ CTL precursors in the MLN was slightly delayed, but potent CTL effectors were present in the virusinfected lung by day 10 after infection and the overall magnitude of the response was not compromised. The prevalence of IgA antibody forming cells (AFCs) was greatly increased in both the MLN and the CLN of the mice given the Mel-14 antibody. The IgM response was prolonged and the IgG response, particularly IgGl, was delayed compared to controls. The altered pattern of the antibody response may reflect the limited availability in Mel-14-treated mice of Th cells secreting lymphokines which are involved in Ig class switching, by blocking the entry of CD4+ Th precursor cells into lymph nodes. FACS sorting for L-selectin+, 8220+, and L-selectin-, B220+ cell populations from the MLN and the CLN of normal B6 mice 9 days post Sendai virus infection, showed that the AFCs were from the L-selectin-, B220+ cell population, a population which comprised 6-10% ofthe total cell population.",

            "text": "We have distinguished targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies present in HIV-1 infected individuals by imunoselection in vitro and by the use of chimeric virus. One target of neutralizing antibodies, defined by an escape mutant with an ala to thr substitution at position 582 in gp41, is resistant to human monoclonal antibodies that map to a site closely congruent with that for CD4 binding. Substitution of gly, ser, and val fail to confer resistance. A second, defined by an ala to val substitution at position 281, upstream from the V3 loop, does not involve the same site and does not involve V3. Substitution of thr or ile also confers resistance. Replacement of the V3 loop of HIV-l(MN) into a clone of HIV-l(IIIB) allows the detection of two other broadly neutralizing targets. One recognizes the V3 peptide of MN but is affected by regions outside V3. The other appears to be conformational and outside V3, but its functional recognition is influenced by the V3 loop. All of these sites seem to depend on the overall conformation of the envelope protein rather than a single discrete linear epitope. Antibodies against amino acids 579-613 of the HIV transmembrane (TM) glycoprotein have been shown to enhance HIV infection in vitro in the presence of complement. There has been no study demonstrating that enhancing antibodies to this region of HIV, despite increasing levels of infectious virus 10 to 100 fold in vitro, adversely affect disease pathogenesis. In two separate studies reported herein, it is shown that animals which have high levels of antibody against this region of SIV, amino acids 603-622 of the envelope, fair poorly compared to animals with lower antibody levels against this region when subsequently challenged with SIV. When actively immunized with a synthetic peptide from this region of SIV, animals died earlier and failed to clear antigen at two weeks after infection compared to animals that received a control peptide (p<0.05). When animals were passively immunized with antibodies from a longterm survivor of SIV infection, those animals that received higher levels of antibody against the TM peptide died within six months compared to longer intervals for those animals that had lower levels of antibody to this region. When taken together, these data suggest that antibody to the TM region of SIV and HIV in general, and to this highly conserved peptide in particular, are detrimental to the host. Therefore, immunization strategies that minimize the immune response against TM or treatment protocols that decrease antibody levels against TM may lead to prolonged survival following exposure to lentiviruses. We have developed a mouse model to examine the immune response to HPV 16 proteins when these proteins are presented to the immune system via the epithelial route. In this model animals are grafted with keratinocytes expressing HPV E6 a n d E7 genes using a transplantation procedure which permits epithelial reformation. Animals so grafted when challenged intradermally with E7 either as protein or via a recombinant vaccinia virus exhibit a delayed type hypersensitivity response which is E7-specific and CD4+ T cell mediated. Animals grafted with a sub optimal priming inoculum of cells develop immune non-responsiveness and have an abrogated DTH response when challenged subsequently with a priming cell graft. In the present study w e have examined the antibody status in these animals. The E7 protein of HPV 16 was expressed in E. coli as a maltose binding fusion protein using the plasmid vector pMalc. After cleavage and affinity purification this protein was used in a n ELISA assay to measure antibody levels in 4 groups of mice (1) those not challenged with E7 (2) mice not grafted but challenged with E7 protein in the ear (3) mice primed by grafting with 107 HPV E7 expressing cells and challenged with E7 protein (4) mice primed by grafting with 5 x 105 HPV 16 E7 cells on day 7, grafted again with lo7 HPV 16 E7 cells on day 14 and challenged with E7 protein in the ear. Mice optimally grafted and challenged (group 3) exhibited high titres of IgG antibodies, particularly elevated levels of IgGza. Mice sub-optimally grafted (Group 4) exhibited IgG antibody levels comparable to the control group (1). The possible mechanisms of this immune attenuation are discussed. The Hepatitis C virus is a frequent cause of chronic liver disease. A proposed mechanism responsible for virus persistence is evasion of the host immune response through a high mutation rate of crucial regions of the viral genome. The portion of HCV genome coding for the amino-terminal part of the putative envelope protein (gp70) undergoes frequent mutation during the course of infection. We have cloned and sequenced the hypervariable region (HVRI) of the virus isolated from an HCV asymptomatic patient at three time points during 18 months follow up. Sequence analysis has allowed the identification of variants of this region and multiple antigenic peptides (MAP), corresponding to three HVRl variants, sequentially foundin the blood stream of the patient, have been synthesized. MAPS have been used as antigens for detection of specific antibodies in ELISA. Our results show that anti-HVRI antibodies and their cognate viral sequence coexist in the blood stream but a viral sequence becomes undetectable when the specific antibodies reach maximum levels of reactivity. Thus humoral immunity against the HVRl may play a role for virus clearence. The presence of anti-HVR1 antibodies was also investigated in 100 hepatitis C viremic individuals and 25 non-viremic patients. A high frequency of positive reaction (90%) against at least one of the three HVRl variants analysed in this study was detected in the viremic patients. Finally, competition experiments show that antibodies crossreacting with more than one HVRl variant are produced by HCV infected individuals. This results suggest that complex cross-reactivity exist between HCV isolates for antibodies against the HVRl region as described for antibodies against the gp120 V3 loop of HIV. We propose as mechanism for viral escape in HCV chronic infections the one described as the \"original antigenic sin\", observed firstly in influenza, in togavirus, paramixovirus, enterovirus, and recently in HIV infection. Using an adult mouse model to study active immunity against rotavirus infection, it was previously shown that oral immunization with some, but not all, animal rotavirus strains induced protection against subsequent infection following oral challenge witb the murine rotavirus strain EDIM (Ward et al., 1992) . To determine i f a specific rotavirus protein could be associated with protection in this model, mice were immunized with a series of 18 reassortants between the fully protective EDIM strain and a partially protective heterologous rotavirus strain (RRV-G). Reassortants that contained genes for EDIM proteins responsible for protection were anticipated to provide complete protection; however, no EDIM proteins were found to be both necessary and sd3cient for full protection. Instead, protection was found to be highly correlated with viral shedding (P = ,005) and with serum rotavirus IgA titers stimulated by the different reassortants (P < ,001). This indicated that protection was related to the intestinal replication properties of the different reassortants rather than to specific immunogenic properties of EDIM proteins. This conclusion was supported by the finding that the titers of serum rotavirus I& but not IgG, stimulated in mice following oral immunization with a series of animal rotaviruses was directly related to protection against EDIM. If these findings can be extended to humans, they suggest that the efficiency of intestinal replication following oral inoculation with a live rotavirus vaccine candidate may be the primary determinant of successful immunization. H a l l Medical Center, 55 individuals with adequate serum samples were identified as either rapidly progressing (RP) or slowly progressing (SP) by clinical and surrogate marker criteria. Anti-V3 profiles were determined using synthetic proteins derived from the amino acid sequences of the V3 region of 5 laboratory strains of HIV-1 in standard capture ELISA format. Serum obtained from each patient at multiple different time points was screened against these peptides. The majority of individuals in both groups demonstrated broad recognition, with reactivity to peptides corresponding to the V3 regions of MN, SF2, NY5 and HAN/SC. Less than 50% of individual in each group recognized the V3 peptide derived from IIIB, @=NS, between groups). As the RP progressed to AIDS there was significant nonspecific narrowing of response, while the SP remained broadly reactivity (P< .001). In v i m neutralizing activity of the homologous laboratory isolates was determined with cytotoxicity, cytopathic effect and p24 Ag inhibition assays. Although most patient serum was capable of inhibiting p24 Ag production in homologous lab strains while AIDS-free, there was no relationship with the ability to inhibit homologous virus effects on target cells and anti-V3 profiles. model, we show that after resolution of the acute infection, when antiviral plasma cells in the spleen decline, a population of virus-specific plasma cells appear in the bone m w and constitute the major sou~ce of longterm antibody production. Following infection of adult mice, Wspecific antibody secreting cells (ASC) peaked in the spleen at 8 days postinfection, but were at this time undetectable in the bone marmw. The infection was essentially cleared by 15 days and the ASC numbers in the spleen rapidly declined while an increasing population of LCMV-specific ASC appeared in the bone marrow. When compared to the peak response at 8 days post-infection, timepoints from 30 days to more than one year later demonstrated greater than a l@fold reduction in splenic ASC. In contrast, JLTvlV-specific plasma cells in the bone marrow remained at high numbers and correlated with the high levels of antiviral serum antibody.",

The University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL 35294. MHC Class I restricted CD8' CTL activity plays an important role in the control of influenza virus infection as indicated in studies in mice and humans. Cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-y regulate the generation of virus-specific CTL responses. We recently demonstrated a good correlation between the induction of influenza virus-specific CTL activity and the production of IFN-y by the CD8' T cells at the single cell level using an IF?-specific ELISPOT assay, secreted IFN-y by an ELISA, and IFN-y specific mRNA expression by RT-PCR. Several recent studies have characterized CD4+ and CD8' T cells by their expression on the surface of distinct D45R isoforms. CD45RA is expressed on naive or virgin T cells, while CD45RO is expressed on memory T cells.",

The CD8' cells were stained for CD45RO' (PE) and CD45RA' (FITC) cells and sorted. CTL activity against virus-infected autologous target cells was determined in a 4 hour 'lCr release assay while IFN-y production and expression was assessed by ELISPOT and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. CDS+/CD45RO+ (memory) cells exhibited significant MHC class I CTL while CDS+/CD45RA+ cells exhibited no lytic activity. No activity was exhibited by freshly isolated or unstimulated CD8+/CD45RO+ T cells. Similarly, CD8+/CD45ROt T cells contained significantly higher numbers of IFN-y spot forming cells and higher quantity of IFN-y-specific mRNA than CD8+/CD45RAC cells. These data support our previous findings that IFN-y may serve as a useful surrogate marker for influenza virus-specific CTL activity in humans. In studying the kinetics of the CD8+ T cell response in LCMV infection we have observed a profound activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells with a 10-40 fold increase in total number peaking at day 8-9 post infection. In C57BW6 mice, most of the viral antigen is cleared by day seven, and after day 9 the total CD8+ number per spleen drops about 10-fold. However, the relative specificity of the viral peptidespecific precursor CTL frequencies @CTWf) per CD8+ cell remains remarkably stable between day 7-8 of the acute infection and for many months thereafter. Thus, the decline in the CD8' T cell number is not a function of the TcR specificities but is rather an across-the-board event.",

            "text": "In contrast, we found that subsequent to the decline of the CTL response to a second heterologous virus infection such that the mouse was in a \"resting, immune'' state, there often was a reduction in pCTL/f to the first virus. For example, infections with W or MCMV substantially reduced the pCTUf to LCMV or PV in all memory compartments, including spleen, lymph nodes, peritoneal exudate cells. Reinfection with the original virus substantially elevated its pCTUf and restored the pCTUf that had been reduced by a heterologous viral infection. Analyses of the progression of CTL responses during a heterologous virus challenge of a virus-immune mouse indicated a high frequency of crossreactive CTL appearing early during infection, but as the infection progressed there was a higher proportion of CTL specific only for the second virus. Thus, we believe that when the across-the-board apoptosis of T cells occurs late in the infection, CTL specific for the first virus are diluted by those responding to the second virus. This may cause the reduction in memory to the first virus and may be one of the mechanisms contributing to the waning of secondary immune responses to certain viruses over time if there is no re-exposure to the original infectious agent. T-cells which arise after virus infection will aid our understanding of Tcell memory and be useful in the design of vaccines which augment the memory response. To estimate the Sendai virus specific precursor frequency in memory mice, CD4+ cells from C57BL6 female mice which had been infected with Sendai virus intranasally (i.n.) more than two months earlier were subjected to limiting dilution analysis. Responder cell populations were enriched for CD4+ cells either by magnetic bead depletion of non-CD4+ cells, or by FACS after staining with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody These enriched (>90% CD4+) responders were cultured with Sendai virus-infected, irradiated, T-cell depleted splenic antigen presenting cells (APC). Supernatants from these cultures were tested for activity on the cytokine-dependent CTLL cell line. Duplicate cultures of responders on uninfected APC were used to set the level of rejection (mean CPM + 3x std. dev.). Using this type of analysis we were able to demonstrate a frequency of memory Thp at 111600 CD4+ cells, compared to a frequency greater than 1/1OOOOO in naive controls. The memory CD4+ cells were further characterized as CD45RB-low (1/472) , CD44-high (1/294), Lselectin-low (1/364), and CD49d-high (VLA-4-high) (V102).

The immune response of influenza A and Sendai-virusspecific, memory CD8' cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLp) have been analyzed in C57BU6 mice infected intranasally with unrelated or cross-reactive respiratory viruses. The numbers of influenza A-specific memory T cells increased in the regional lymph nodes (LN), spleen and bronchoalveolar lavage through the course of an irrelevant infection (influenza B). Memory T cells showed evidence of enhanced steady-state activation. Profiles of CTLp recruitment were analyzed in association with T cell proliferation and activation to determine whether signaling via the T cell receptor is necessary to induce \"bystander\" stimulation of the memory T cell pool. The extent of T cell proliferation was addressed by treating mice with low doses of cyclophosphamide (Cy). \"Resting\" Sendai virus-specific memory T cells were unaffected by Cy treatment, however upon challenge with influenza and treated 5 or 6 days later, the emergence of influenzaspecific CTLp was severely diminished. Cell cycle analysis showed that Cy eliminated the majority of CD8' T cells from the LN and spleen resulting in DNA fragmentation of 12-18% ofthis lymphocyte subset. A decrease (though smaller) in the numbers of Sendai virus-specific CTLp indicated that some of the cycling cells killed by Cy were memory T cells, presumably activated in a \"bystander\" manner. The decrease in CTLp numbers for both influenza and Sendai virus-specific CTLp was still apparent 9 days after Cy treatment, long after the viral elimination. Thus, immune responses to unrelated antigens may be a mechanism involved in maintaining the pool of memory T cells. Experimentally VSV can result in an acute CNS infection of mice. Data from our in vitro experiments indicate that NO has inhibitory effect on productive VSV infection. VSV infection at Neuroblastoma NB41 A3 cells was significantly inhibited by lOOpM of a NO donor S-Nitro-N-acetylpencillamine (SNAP), while 1OOpM of the control compound N-acetylpencillamine (NAP) had no effect. When VSV infected NB41A3 cells were treated with 500pM of a constitutive NO synthase (cNOS) activator N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA), a significant inhibition of VSV production was observed. Inhibition by 500pM of NMDA was reversed by 300pM of NOS inhibitor N-Methyl-L-Arginine (L-NMA).",

Recently, it was shown that lymphocytes isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) of C57BU6 mice both acutely and persistently infected with MHV-JHM display a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the S protein of MHV-JHM. This response was further characterized by identifying the CTL epitopes that are recognized by a bulk population of CTLs from the CNS of MHV-JHM infected C57BV6 mice. Three epitopes were identified using synthetic peptides and truncated forms of the S protein in primary CIZ assays. The epitopes recognized were amino acids 510-518 (CSLWNGPHL, Db), 598-605 (RCQIFANI, Kb), and 1143-1151 (NFCGNGNHI, Db). Thus, the results indicate that cytotoxic T lymphocytes responsive to the S protein of MHV-JHM in C57BU6 mice recognize both Kb and Db-restricted CIL epitopes. CTL lines and clones specific to these peptides and the entire S protein are being developed to test their biological significance in vivo with respect to the acute encephalitis and chronic demyelinating disease caused by MHV-JHM. A marked change in susceptibility to some neurotropic viruses during the first few postnatal weeks has long been recognised in rodents. Infection of neonatal or suckling mice with the neurotropic alphavirus, Semliii Forest virus results in lethal encephalitis. Infection of weaned animals is not lethal. Earlier investigations focusing on changes in specific immunity have shown this not to be the explanation. Infection of 3-4 week old mice with severe combined immunodeficiency does not result in acute rapidly fatal encephalitis. We have studied mortality, neuroanatomical distribution and spread of infection in mice of different ages and the effect of gold compounds on rendering infection of 3-4 week old mice lethal. Neuroanatomical distribution of infection correlates with synaptogenesis. As this is completed in different systems within the first two weeks postnatal, systems no longer transmit virus and infection switches from disseminated to focal and restricted. Complete productive replication and transmission of infection require smooth membrane synthesis which is present in neurones undergoing synaptogenesis, absent in mature neurones but inducible by administration of gold compounds. Infection of neurones undergoing synaptogenesis is productive and virus is transmitted along neuralpathways, infection spreads rapidly around the brain, destroys cells and animlas die of a fulminant encephalitis. In mice infected after 14 days of age replication in mature neurones is restricted, nonproductive, cannot be transmitted, does not spread, is non-destructive and non-lethal. As a consequence, in the absence of immune responses virus can persist in isolated CNS cells for life and can even be detected by reverse transcriptase PCR in immunocompetent mice months after infection. In the presence of an immune response, CD8+ T-cells recognise and destroy infected glial cells leading to dem yelination. A~k e r m a n n ,~ Virology Swine,' Virology Cattle,' and Avian Diseases3 Research Units, National Animal Disease Center, USOA, Agricultural Research Service, Ames, IA 5001 0 A recombinant pseudorabies virus (PRV) (LLTBAP) was constructed which contains a 3.0 kb deletion spanning the standard recombination junction of the unique long and internal repeat sequences replaced by e lacZ expression cassette. This deletion interrupted the large latency transcript gene (LLT) and truncated one copy of the diploid immediate early IEl80 gene. Replication and viral gene expression of LLTBAZ in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells was similar to that of the parental virus and a virus rescued for the deleted sequences (LLTBres). When inoculated intranasally in 4-week-old or 4-day-old pigs, LLTBA2 replicated efficiently at the site of inoculation yet caused markedly reduced fatality when compared to the parent or LLTBres viruses. In particular, the LLTBA2-infected pigs did not exhibit neurological symptoms characteristic of PRV infection. To further examine the pathogenesis of LLTBA2, 4-day-old pigs were infected intranasally with LLTpA2 or LLTBres and necropsied at various times postinfection. Virus isolation from the nasal turbinate, tonsils, and trigeminal ganglia was comparable between the two viruses. Although both viruses spread to the brain and induced an inflammatory response in CNS tissues, virus isolation from brain tissues was reduced about 20-fold for LLTpA2. Abundant PRV antigen was detected in the cerebrum and cerebellum of LLTpresinfected pigs, but only a few antigen positive neurons were observed in the cerebrum of LLTBA2-infected pigs. While replication of LLTBres in the brain progressed until death at 7 days post-infection, replication of LLTpA2 in the brain ceased by 9 days post-infection and the pigs exhibited only mild clinical signs. Since LLTBA2 is capable of spread to the CNS, reduced neurovirulence of LLTBAZ is likely the result of its decreased ability to replicate in CNS tissues. The CNS is a target for HIV infection, and in individuals with AIDS this can lead to a devastatin dementia. Only certain viral variants appear capable 07 invading the CNS and infecting microglia and brain macrophages. In order to determine whether the virus entering the brain may be particularly pathogenic to the CNS, we isolated microglia from the brains of SIV-infected rhesus monkeys. Transfer of these cells into naive animals indicated that productive SIV infection could indeed be transferred. Furthermore, CNS infection occurred within a relatively short time span, and was associated with viral gene expression in the brain and pathology characteristic of HIV encephalitis. Serial transfer of microglia into additional animals also resulted in successful transfer of infection, neuroinvasion, and neuropathology. Behavioral analysis in a trained group of animals is ongoing.",

IFN-y-induced nitric oxide (NO) in murine macrophages was previously shown to inhibit the replication of poxviruses and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) . We now demonstrate that murine macrophages activated as a consequence of vaccinia virus (VV) infection in viva express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iOS). The VVelicited macrophages were resistant to infection with W and efficiently blocked the replication of W and HSV-1 in infected bystander cells of epithelial and fibroblast origin. This inhibition was arginine dependent, correlated with NO production in cultures and was reversible by the NOS inhibitor NQJmonomethyl-L-arginine. The mechanism of NO mediated inhibition of virus replication was studied by treating VV-infected 293 cells with the NOproducing compound, S-niuoso-N-afetyl-penicillamine. Antibodies specific for temporally expressed viral proteins, a VV-specific DNA probe and transmission electron microscopy were employed to show that NO inhibited late gene protein synthesis, viral DNA replication and virus particle formation, but not expression of the early proteins analyzed. Further, we have also identified putative enzymatic targets of inactivation by NO that results in inhibition VV replication. Although antiviral CTL are important for virus elimination. they can only halt further virus spread, and cannot reduce the number of infectious particles already present. The beneficial effect of CTL-mediated lysis is apparent only if infected cells are lysed before assembly of progeny virus. If infectious virus was released from infected cells in solid tissues before the generation of neutralizing antibody or in sites where antibody did not readily penetrate, then recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes, which phagocytose and destroy infectious material and/or become non-productively infected, would definitely help control virus dissemination. In this context, iNOS induction in macrophages may be an important antiviral strategy. In addition, the inhibition of virus replication in infected contiguous cells by iNOS-expressing macrophages at infectious foci would prevent release of mature viral particles after lysis by NK cells and CTL. Since viral early proteins are expressed in such infected cells, their recognition and subsequent lysis by CTLs will not be hindered.",

We have analyzed SlVenv sequences by PCR amplification directly from microglia DNA preparations from monkeys. Nucleotide sequence analysis results in an enrichment of unique sequences in the V1 region of the SIV env gene. The majority (>95%) of nucleotide changes encoded amino acid changes, indicating that these envelope sequences evolved as a result of selection. Moreover, sequential passage of SIVassociated microglia resulted in an increase in potential N-linked glycosylation sites within the V1 region of the env gene when compared with the parental virus. These data suggest that sequential passage of microgliaassociated SIV may select for neuroinvasive, neurovirulent variants. The adoptive transfer of CTL specific for an Ld-restricted epitope within the nucleocapsid protein of the JHMV strain of mouse hepatitis virus both protect from acute infection and reduce virus replication in the MHC class 1 positive cells within the CNS. The source of these CTL and the route of their delivery is critical in the outcome of this protection. For example, 10 fold less spleen cells activated in vitro with the pN peptide are required for protection via the direct i.c. route than the i.v. route. In addition, CTL clones are unable to protect via the i.v. route and are very efficient via the i.c. route. These data suggested the possibility that the CD4+ T cells within the polyclonal activated spleen cell population derived from in vitro culture on the pN peptide were facilitating access to the CNS. To examine this question, polyclonal pN-specific T cells were either depleted of CD4+ T cells prior to transfer to infected recipients or untreated cells were transferred to recipients depleted of CD4+ T cells with monoclonal antibody GK1.5. Both of these treatments eliminated the ability of the CTL to reduce virus replication within the CNS, suggesting that CD4+ T cells in the peripheral compartment are required for the entry of CTL into the parenchyma of the CNS during acute CNS encephalomyelitis.",

Because of its early expression during the HSV replication cycle, lCP27 represents a prime target for specific T cell responses susceptible of controlling virus replication. We have expressed in E. coli a remmbinant construct coding for a fusion protein consisting of a fragment of influenza virus non-structural protein4 (NSI) and the lCP27 sequence of HSV-2. The NSI-ICP27 protein was purified by preparative eleclmplmresis and formulated in oil-in-water emulsions with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QSZl adjuvants. BalWc mice were immunized by two intrafootpad injections of formulations containing 5 pg of NSI-ICP27.

The induction of ICP27 specific CTL by different formulations was observed and will be discussed. The induction of heterologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) using cassettes of multiple conserved T cell epitopes derived from different proteins and/or virus strains is envisioned as a promising vaccine approach.

This vector also has been used to express the H N W C A protein in a form recognized by patient sera and a specific antibody on Western blots. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using vectors based on attenuated VEE cDNA clones for protective immunization against heterologous human and animal pathogens. Dose/response curves have been used to compare different routes of immunization with plasmid DNA encoding the H1 hemagglutinin glycoprotein of influenza virus. Routes of inoculation included intramuscular, intradermal and gene gun delivery of DNA. From 100 to 0.1 ug of DNA was inoculated by intramuscular and intradermal routes. From 0.4 ug to 0.0004 ug of DNA was inoculated by gene gun. Each route was evaluated for single and boosted immunizations. Antibody titers were followed Over a 20 week period, following which animals were evaluated for protection against a lethal challenge. Each of the routes raised both antibody and protective responses. Gene gun-delivery of DNA required 250 to 2,500 times less DNA to raise responses than the intramuscular and intradermal inoculations. Boosts did not have much of an effect on antibody titer or protection except at low dose inoculations (4 ng and lower for the gene gun). For each of the routes, antibody responses showed good persistence over the 20 weeks of the experiment. Inoculation of mice with plasmid vectors carrying a microbial gene under the control of an appropriate promoter results in a full spectrum of immune responses to the vectorencoded antigen. Using a murine rabies model a plasmid termed pSGSrab.gp expressing the full-length rabies virus glycoprotein regulated by an SV40 promoter was shown to induce upon inmuscular inoculation a rabies virus specific T helper cell response. of the Thl type, cytolytic T cells and virus neutralizing antibodies resulting in protection against a subsequent challenge with live rabies virus given either peripherally or directly into the cenaal nervous system. A response comparable in magnitude was also induce upon inoculation of a vector expressing a secreted form of the rabies virus glycoprotein. The immune response to the DNA vaccine could be modulated by co-injection of the rabies virus glycoprotein-expressing vector with plasmids expressing mouse cytokines. Inoculation of mice with the pSG5rab.gp vector and a vector expressing granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhanced both the T helper and the B cell response to rabies virus thus improving vaccine efficacy. Co-inoculation with vectors expressing interferon-g failed to improve the response. Co-inoculation of the antigen-expressing vector with a plasmid encoding mouse I L 4 caused a reduction of both the T helper cell response and the B cell response to rabies VlNS.",

A mouse transgenic for the E7 protein of HPV16, and expressing E7 protein in the skin, has recently been described (1) and these mice develop spontaneous humoral immunity to E7 protein similar to patients with cervical cancer(2). To determine whether immunisation could induce immunity to E7 sufficient to allow tumour rejection, we firstly demonstrated that immunisation of H-Zb mice with HPV16E7 protein with Quil A as adjuvant could induce cytotoxic T cells able to kill HPV16 E7 expressing tumour cells in nrro. We then used similar immunisation with E7IQuil A to induce E7 specific immunity in FVB (H-29) mice. H-2qskin @s expressing E7 were not rejected by E7 immunised H-Zq mice, though immunisation induced antibody to E7, and similar grafts were rejected, as expected, across an doantigen mismatch in H-Zb mice. We conclude either that HPVl6 E7 lack a Tc epitope in the context of H-Zq, or that expression ofE7 in the skin from the E7 transgenic mice is insufficient for recognition by primed effector cells, and further experiments will address this distinction. Cervical carcinoma Is strongly associated with infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 or 18, and continued expression of the E6 and E7 gene products. This provides an opportunity for an immunotherapeutic approach to the treatment of cervical carcinoma by activation of immune reponses directed against these virally encoded tumour specific antigens. We have constructed a recornbinant vaccinia virus expressing E6 and E7 from HPV16 and 18 with the aim of inducing E6 and E7 specific HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The sequences have been inserted into the Wyeth vaccine strain of vaccinia virus at a single locus in the form of two separate fused E6/E7 reading frames, each under the control of an early v a d n i a promoter, and each modified to inactivate the Rb binding site. The virus has been characterised with respect to its ability to synthesise the expected HPV proteins, its genetic stability, and growth and virulence in a mouse model prior to use in human clinical trials.",

Humans, however, undergo multiple influenza infections as previous infections appear to provide weak or short-lived protection against the continual antigenic change of strains. We have previously shown that immunization of naive mice with DNA encoding the conserved internal antigen nucleoprotein (NP) provides protection against both H1 and H3 strains of A/influenza. Although such mice became infected they were resistant to weight loss and death this differed substantially from A/PR8 and A/HK recovered mice which were resistant to subsequent infection. To produce a more representative model of human infection, we infected the lungs of mice with currently circulating strains of human influenza. Mice that had been given lung infections with A/Beijing/92 were susceptible to subsequent infection with the A/HK/68 strain although they were resistant to weight loss and death. Other strains such as A/Beijing/89 or A/Georgia/93 provided only marginal protection against weight loss and death against A/HK challenge. Mice that were immunized with NP DNA had greater resistance to weight loss and death after A/HK/68 challenge than mice previously infected with A/Bei/89 and A/Ga/93, and were similar to mice that had been previously infected with A/Bei/92. Thus, infection with different virus strains provide various levels of cross strain protection and the level of protection provided by immunization with DNA can exceed that induced by live influenza infection. The development of Sendai virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effectors and precursors (p) has been compared for mice that are homozygous (-/-) for a disruption of the H-21-Ab class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoprotein, and for normal (+I+) controls. The generation of CD8+ CTLp was not diminished in the (-/-) mice, although they failed to make virusspecific IgG class antibodies. While the cellularity of the regional lymph nodes was decreased, the inflammatory process assayed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the infected lung was not modified and potent CTL effectors were present in BAL populations recovered from both groups at day 10 after infection. There was little effect on virus clearance. As found previously with CD4-depleted H-2b mice, the absence of a concurrent class Il-MHC-restricted response does not compromise the development of Sendai virus -specific CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity. The importance of cytoxic T lymphocytes in defense against acute and chronic viral infections is gaining increasing recognition. Our approach to investigating the structure-function relationship between immunogens and their in vivo ability to elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses has been to formulate simple, well-defined structures that vary in their ability to introduce associated antigens directly into the cytoplasm of antigen presenting cells.",

Here we describe for the frst time a rapid method (reverse immunogenetics) for identifing T-cell epitopes, together with a transgenic mouse model as a guide for testing the cellular immune response to a mixture of the lipohexapeptide immunoadjuvant PamgCys-Ser-(Lys)4 and synthetic HTLV-1 peptides which seem suitable for vaccine design. HTLV-1 amino acid sequences were searched for eight to 14mer patterns carrying the anchor residues of the HLA-B*3501 peptide motif at positions two and eight to fourteen. 65 candidate peptides were synthesized according to the matched sequence patterns. Their HLA-B*3501 affinity was quantitatively analyzed in an indirect immunofluorescence peptide binding assay using RMA-S-B*3501 cells. The fourth group (controls) were inoculated with H3N2 (IN) thereby providing heterotypic CTL immunity in the context of a natural infection without the confounding effects of humoral immunity against surface antigens. All four types of inoculations have been shown to protect normal (class I expressing) mice from a lethal challenge with influenza, presumably mediated by class I restricted cytotoxic T cells. The two groups inoculated via the intranasal route may gain additional protection by activating the mucosal immune system (IgA). None of these types of inoculations has been evaluated in the context of class I1 restricted cytotoxic T cells, the only CTLs found in class I deficient mice. For all four types of inoculations, MHC class I deficient mice lost significantly more weight than the class I expressing control groups (seven mice per group) indicating the importance of class I restricted T-cells in protection. Within the class I expressing groups, there was no significant difference between the four types of inoculations; within the class I deficient groups the VAC-NP IM immunized mice lost significantly more weight than the H3N2 group;the other two groups, VAC-NP IN and genetically immunized groups had intermediary results. These data lend support for a protective role for mucosal immunity. Results on both class I and class I1 CTL activity for the four types of inoculations will also be presented.

Reactivity from the end of C1 through early C2 (LAI #I 12-21 1) is particularly prominent and contains previously undescribed Th epitopes (asterisks). Conspicuously missing is reactivity to the V3 loop peptide (LA1 #300). Although the percent reactivity to the entire gp120 molecule is similar between the immunization groups, there is differential recognition of some of the individual peptides, particularly peptides in early C3 (LAI #319-348). The intracytoplasmic lifecycle of Listeriu mmcytogenes (LM) enables it to be a convenient vaccine vehicle for the introduction of foreign proteins into the MHC class I pathway of antigen presentation. Taking advantage of these properties, we have inserted the nucleoprotein (NP) gene from lymphocytic choriorneningitis virus (LCMV) into the LM chromosome by site specific homologous recombination. Infection of mice with recombinant LM expressing LCMV-NP elicited a virus-specific CTL response. We were able to recover LCMV-NP specific CTL precursers from recombinant LM vaccinated mice as shown by vigorous secondary CTL responses after in vitro stimulation. In contrast to mice immunized with wild type LM, mice vaccinated with NP-recombinant LM were protected against challenge with immunosuppressive LCMV variants. Protection was demonstrated by reduced viral titers or complete clearance of LCMV from serum and various organs including, spleen, liver, lung, kidney, and brain. The kinetics of the LCMV challenge indicate that mice vaccinated with recombinant LM were able to arrest viral growth early in the infection due to a strong CTL response and did not exhibit the immunopathology associated with infection of naive mice. Since LM not only delivers antigens into the MHC class I pathway but also induces IL-12 production, it has the potential to function simultaneously as a vehicle for expressing foreign antigens and as an adjuvant promoting cell mediated immunity. , latent membrane protein [LMP] 1 and 2A) in chromium release assays.

The EBV-specific CTL lines expressed CD3/CD8 and mAb blocking experiments demonstrated that the majority of target cell lysis was inhibited by antibody against MHC class-I but not antibody against MHC class-11. These results represent one of the first reports characterizing EBV-specific CTL responses in young children. The striking similarity between EBV-specific CTL responses described here in young children and those reported for adults suggests that the EBNA 3 family of proteins and LMP 2A should be considered for inclusion in candidate EBV vaccines.",

Departments of Virology' and Immunology,2 Genetic Therapy, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878 Replication deficient recombinant adenovirus (Av) vectors are efficient gene delivery vehicles currently being developed for a variety of in vivo gene therapy strategies such a s for the fatal pulmonary component of cystic fibrosis. The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is one of the most widely accepted animal models for studying these Av vectors because wild type human adenovirus replicates in cotton rats and because of the histopathologic similarities of infected respiratory epithelial tissues from humans and cotton rats. Despite this, methods for studying immunologic responses in the cotton rat have not been developed. Importantly, recent studies in the cotton rat (Gene Tber. 1 :192-200; 1994) in our laboratory suggest that a dose-dependent specific immune response to Av vectors can limit expression of the transgene. In this context, w e have established methods to evaluate cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses to Av vectors in the cotton rat. To accomplish this, a CTL target cell line was established consisting of primary cotton rat lung fibroblasts (CRLF). Splenocytes from cotton rats exposed previously to an Av vector were harvested, cultured in virro with irradiated, AddB274nfected CRLF. Cultured (effector) splenocytes were then incubated with S'Cr-labelled CRLF (target) cells a t effectoctarget (E:T) ratios of 100, 50 and 10. In parallel, splenocytes from naive cotton rats served as negative controls. Results demonstrated vector-specific CTL lysis of target cells significantly greater than controls: 80.3 f 1.3% vs 6.2* 0.5%. 49.6*1.6% v s 5.7*0.4%. and 22.8*3.5% vs4.8*0.5% (MeanrtS.E.M., n=3; p<O.Ol, all comparisons) a t E:T ratios of 100, 50 and 10, respectively. Thus, a specific CTL response does develop in cotton rats following in vivo Av vector administration. This observation will be useful in guiding vector modifications in the rational development of improved vectors for clinical use. The identification of CTL epitopes is essential for subunit vaccine design against AIDS. A major portion of the anti-viral CTL responses after infection with HTV in humans or SIV in rhesus macaques is made up by anti-gag specificities. Here, effector cell populations were established from HIV seropositive individuals by specific stimulation of PBL with pfa fixed autologous B-LCL infected with TW gag. Expanded cultures were then tested for CTL activity against autologous B-LCL pulsed with overlapping 20-mer peptides derived from p24. Two individuals (008 and 617) had CTL against p24.14 (a(mino) a(cids) 263-282, KRWIILGLNKNRMYSFTSI), two others (038 and 157) recognized p24.17 (aa293-312, FRDWDRFYKTLRAEQASQD).",

An understanding of such CVB3,-i mmune cell interactions is criitical for gaining insight into the pathogenesis and persistence of enteroviral infection both within and outside of the immune system. Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of virus infections depends upon identification of viral gene products involved in host-virus interactions in vivo. Many viral gene products which affect pathogenesis in vivo are nonessential for virus replication in vitro. Therefore, we constructed insertion or deletion mutants in the Hind I11 J and I regions of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) to assess the importance of these genes in in vivo replication of virus as well as interaction with immune regulatory and effector cells. Three mutants replicated in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts as efficiently as wild-type virus, thus confirming the nonessential nature of the genes. Deletion of 2.8 Kb in Hind I11 J and of 7.7 Kb in Hind I11 J and I resulted in mutants with reduced replication in target organs in vivo. An insertion in Hind I11 J had no significant effect on replication in mouse salivary gland, but curtailed growth of the virus in footpad fibroblasts and subsequent priming of MCMVspecific CPL precursors in the draining lymph node. In addition, the 7.7 Kb deletion mutant was unique in its failure to replicate in a permissive, differentiated macrophage cell line. Current studies aim to further define the role of this gene region in HCMV pathogenesis. that in VV5-4 progression o f V V life cycle is blocked at the the uncoating II or replication stage.

Recent evidence suggests that a subclass of poxvirus-encoded host response modifiers interferes with host defense responses, and thus can be termed immune or inflammatory response modifiers (irms). Several poxvirusencoded irms possess homology to mammalian proteins which are associated with host defenses, while other poxvirus irms have little sequence homology to immune-effector molecules or their receptors. The Ultrecht strain of rabbitpox (RPV) virus induces a large reddish pock on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryo. RPV mutants lacking the SPI-2/crmN38K gene trigger an inflammatory response by 36-48 hr after inoculation, similarly to that found for cowpox virus (Brighton red strain) mutants. RPV mutant viruses with a deletion of the PS/HR gene, a gene which has recently been associated with virus host range and virion maturation, elicited an inflammatory response on the chicken embryo CAM at 48-72 hr after virus inoculation. Thus, another poxvirus-encoded gene product has been identified that has irm functional activity which would not have been predicted by sequence analyses.",

            "text": "Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) follows three stages of infection in the immunowmpetent host. Following the initial acute infection, a persistent infection remains in which lytic virus resides in the acinar cells of the salivary glands. Finally a third stage of infection exists which is characterized by a lack of detectable infectious virus. It is not known whether MCMV remains persistent at some low level during this thiid stage or establishes molecular latency. To test this, spleens, kidneys and Salivary glands from mice 2-8 months post infection were evaluated by two sensitive assays. Sensitivity was tested using virus co-cultured on murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) for 14 days. By this method, 1 pfu MCMV was reproducibly detected in the presence of sonicated spleen, kidney and salivary glands diluted 1:lO. SCID mice were used as a second detection assay for MCMV. Using 46 SCID mice and different doses of virus, the LDs, of MCMV in SCID mice was 2-3 pfu. MCMV infections were detected when 10-25 pfu were added to sonicated spleens, kidneys, and salivary glands prior to injection into SCID mice. Using both co-culture with MEFs and injection of tissue into SCID mice, we have tested a total of 34 spleens, 34 kidneys, and 37 salivary glands and have detected no persistent virus. While no preformed virus existed in these tissues, reactivation from explanted spleen, kidney and peritoneal exudate cells occurs in culture after 10-40 days. In addition, lytic MCMV was detected in SCID mice 28 days after injection with 2(10)' kidney cells from latently infected mice. Following identical transfers of latent spleen cells, MCMV was not detected in SCID mice although explants from the same organs reactivated in vitro. Using FACS sorting, panning, magnetic bead separation, and reactivation assays, individual cell types have been analyzed for the presence of MCMV genome and the ability to reactivate virus. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are expressed in all organisms in response to a variety of stresses, including virus infection. However, since viruses are not known to encode HSP genes, this represents expression of cellular HSPs. We have found a dramatic induction of the 72kDa HSP in the ovaries of W-infected mice, and using primary ovarian fibroblasts, demonstrated HSP72 mRNA within virus-infected cells. The physiological role of HSPs expressed during virus infection is unknown, although HSPs act as molecular chaperones to facilitate protein folding and assembly in unstressed cells, and a number of bacterial HSPs are essential for bacteriophage replication and morphogenesis. In order to determine whether HSP72 expression was beneficial to VV replication, we constructed a recombinant VV which encoded murine HSP72, but found that this virus grew to similar titres as control viruses, both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, kinetic studies of virus growth in an HSP72-negative cell line showed no difference from control viruses, and the presence of HSP72 did not influence the virulence of infection in immunocompromised nude mice. These results are interesting given that HSP70 proteins act as molecular chaperones and that HSP72 can be found in association with VV proteins. We suggest that this association may simply reflect the inherent affinity of HSP70 for non-native proteins, and the close physiological proximity of HSP and nascent viral proteins within the virus infected cell. Our results indicate that the functional significance of these interactions are minimal with respect to the outcome of virus infection. Furthermore, although the expression of HSW2 in VV-infected mice coincides with the peak anti-viral cellular immune response, HSP72 does not appear to be immunologically significant, as we cannot demonstrate any immunological responses to HSP72 during the course of VV infection. The effect of in vivo neutralisation of IFN-y on cytokine production during influenza infection was compared in CS7/BL6 and BALB/c mice. Similar cytokine profiles were obtained on in v i m restimulation of MLN or spleen cells from virus-infected mice of each strain. At days 7 and 10 postinfection, MLN or spleen cells from both strains of mice produced IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-y, but little or no IL-4 or IL-5. However, following in vivo treatment with anti-IFN-y antibody, production of 1L-4 and IL-S was induced in MLN and spleen cells of BALB/c mice whereas those from CS7/BL6 mice showed little change in cytokine profile. An increase in IL-6 and 1L-10 production was also observed on in virro restimulation of splenocytes from BALB/c mice. However, significant amounts of 1L-2 and IFN-y were still secreted in these cultures. In v i m neutralisation of IFN-y in the restimulated cultures had little effect on the production of other cytokines, regardless of whether this cytokine had also been neutralised in vivo .Despite the change in cytokine profile, anti-IFN-y treatment had no effect on the kinetics of viral clearance in BALB/c mice. A similar situation was seen for C57/BL6 mice. Congenic strains of mice are currently being used to determine whether the effect on cytokine profiles is associated with the MHC haplotype.",

Spitalnik, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania and The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104 Rabies virus glycoprotein (RGP) is the only glycoprotein on the viral surface, is the target of viral neutralizing antibodies, and is the viral protein that interacts with the host cell receptor. RGP of the ERA strain is a 505 amino acid Type I membrane glycoprotein with 3 potential N-glycosylation sites at Asn37, Asn247, and Asn319. Due to RGPs central role in the immunology and biology of rabies, it is important to determine its three-dimensional structure. Towards this end we produced a recombinant form of RGP that may be more amenable to analysis by x-ray crystallography. To avoid the use of detergents, we constructed a soluble 434 amino acid form of RGP lacking a transmembrane domain (RGPT434). RGPT434 was secreted by transfected cells and was appropriately glycosylated, assembled, antigenic, and immunogenic. Since N-glycosylation was required for RGPT434 secretion, we minimized the number of N-glycans by site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, RGPT434 was secreted only when Asn3l 9 was N-glycosylated. In contrast, full-length RGP was expressed at the cell surface a any of the three potential sites was N-glycosylated. Soluble inhibitors of N-glycosylation were used to simplify the structures of the N-glycans on RGPT434. Although inhibiting alpha-glucosidases with castanospermine blocked secretion, inhibiting any further processing with deoxymannojirimycin had no effect on secretion. Finally, to simplify the purification process, a tail of 6 His residues was added to the COOH-terminus of RGPT434. This modification did not affect secretion, antigenicity, of assembly of the recombinant glycoprotein, but did allow purification using Ni+2-agarose chromatography. In summary, we constructed a soluble form of RGP with a minimal number of homogeneous N-glycans and an \"epitope\" tag. This form of RGP is structurally similar to the extracellular domain of the full-length protein and may be amenable to analysis by x-ray crystallography. Endogenous retroviral genes (ev) are well characterized in chickens. Our laboratory has established chicken lines with single and multiple ev loci and, compared to ev negative birds, these lines exhibit a delayed and suppressed titer of neutralizing antibody in responses to avian leukosis virus (ALV) challenge. To address the effects of ev genes on the cell mediated immune response we have developed an in-vitro assay to monitor the in-vivo induction of MHC restricted cytotoxic T cells (CTL) induced by ALV. Using this assay, we find the CTL response in birds expressing the ev-21 locus is reduced 85 to 95% compared to ev negative birds having nearly identical (eighth backcross) genetic backgrounds. Other ev loci (1,6,10 and 11 ) also reduce the CTL response to ALV in MHC matched chickens with different genetic backgrounds. ' National Public Health Institute. Helsinki. Finland",

Siblings of the index IDDM cases who progressed to clinical IDDM experienced enterovim infections more frequently than nonprogressing siblings during prospective follow-up period. Enterovim infections were initially demonstrated by detecting significant increases in serum class-specific cross-reactive enteroviral antibodies by using radioimmunoassay (RIA) with the heavy-chain capture principle. Causal association benveen these infections and the pathogenesis of IDDM was suggested by temporal association of sercconvenions of viral antibodies with increases in islet cell antibody levels which are considered to be markers OK ficell damage. The possibility of the existmce of specific diabetogenic s & s of enternviruses was then considered. To identify the serotypzs responsible for the infections, successive sera from subjects exhibiting seroconvenion of autoantibodies coinciding with an increase in enteroviral antibodies were anlyzed by plaque n e u n a t i o n assay using a set of different enterovhes. The results indicate that several enternvirus serotypes may be associated with the progressive prediabetic p~ocess. Not only different coxsackie B but also coxsackievirus A9 -infections were found to coincide with seroconvenions of islet-cell and insulin auwantibodies. It is known that an immunogenic region of GAD 65. one of the major isletcell antigens, shows a high degree of homology with the 2C protein of CBV-4. Studies on potential immunological cross-reactions between enteroviruses and two significant autoantigens, HSP60 and GAD65, are in progress. This is carried out by using immunohistochemistry in infected cell lines and in frown sections of human pancreas with antibodies induced by synthetic peptides and natural and expressed viral proteins, The role of p53 alterations in human malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPM) is unclear. Immunostaining (IPOX) of snap frozen MPM specimens revealed p53 expression in 31 of 52 (60%). p53 detection by IPOX is usually associated with mutated p53. SSCP for exons 5-9 revealed p53 alterations in 2 of 25 specimens, and LOH at exon 4 was seen in only 2 of 12 evaluable specimens. Thus, most of these specimens appeared to contain wild-type (wt) p53. We recently reported that SV40 induces mesotheliomas in rodents, and that SV40-like sequences are present and expressed in MPM. Of note, SV40 large T antigen (Tag) binds and inactivates wt p53 i n ! , abolishing its tumor suppressor function. We theorized that the immunohistochemical persistence of p53 may result from its physicdl binding with Tag. Tag was detected by IPOX in 32 (62%) of these MPM specimens. Expression of Tag was significantly associated with coexpression of wt p53 (p2 = 0.008, Fisher's exact text), and preliminary experiments suggest co-precipitation of p53 and Tag. Finally, we demonstrate that WAF-1 is not detectable in MPM expressing wt p53 suggesting that p53 is inactive. We speculate that Tag expression in MPM binds to and inactivates p53 contributing to the malignant phenotype. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is involved in 90% of cervical carcinomas and possibly 95% of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). At present it is unclear whether patients infected with the transforming HPV types can mount efficient T cell responses. To address this issue we examined the CTL response of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients attending a cervical neoplasia outpatient clinic. All were diagnosed HPV positive with various stages of C M and nine patients were selected for HLA-A2 expression by FACS analysis. PBMC were stimulated with CaSki, a cervical carcinoma cell line demonstrated to be HF' V type 16' and HLA-A2'. Culture media consisted of RPMI-10% human serum supplemented in three cases with 15 U/ml IL-7, in another three cases with 3 U/ml IL-2 and 15 U/ml IL-7, and in the final three cases with 10 U/ml IL-2 and 15 U/ml IL-7. The CTL were screened for reactivity to CaSki and in addition the cervical carcinoma cell line C33A (HPV, HLA-A2') transfected with either the HPV type 16 E6 or E7 genes. One patient's cells maintained with 10 Uiml IL-2 and 15 Ulml IL-7 showed HPV E7 protein specific cytotoxicity in a HLA-A2 restricted fashion. These CTL lysed the CaSki stimulator cell line but not the NK sensitive target K-562. The CTL efFIciently lysed a C33A-E7 clone but in contrast a vector only transfectant was not lysed. The lysis of C33A-E7 was blocked with a-CD3 and a-CD8 antibodies at 66% and 41% respectively. FACS analysis determined that this CTL population was 92.8 % CD3'CDS' and 7.3% CD3'CD4'. Limited E6 recognition was also observed but has not been hlly characterized To our knowledge this report represents the first demonstration of HPV E7 responsive CTL isolated from the peripheral blood of HF' V infected patients. We have previously shown that proviral variants found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HIV-1 infected individuals can interfere with recognition by autologous cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). Abolition of recognition could be caused by interference with t h e processing of viral peptides, by a failure of the variant peptides to bind to MHC class-I molecules or by a failure of the MHC class-Vpeptide complex to efficiently activate the TCR (T-cell receptor). These mechanisms could allow the virus to escape the immune surveillance by CTL.",

Enteroviruses are a large group of positive stranded RNA viruses known to be responsible for a number of distinct disease entities. Recombination is thought to be capable of generating new enterovirus strains that cause significant morbidity. For example, enterovirus 70 which was responsible for a pandemic of haemorrhagic conjunctivitis and poliomyelitis is thought to have originated by recombination between a coxsackie B like virus and another unidentified enterovirus. We are studying a group of echovirus 11 isolates from an outbreak of disease in southem India. Sequence analysis within the 5' untranslated region reveals that these isolates fall into two groups that differ by -20% (equivalent diversity to that seen between between published sequences of poliovirus 1 and coxsackie A 9 virus).",

Isolates of group 2, with one exception, grow only on HT29 cells. Analysis of the structural proteins of these isolates revealed differences in migration that correlated with their cellular tropism. Thus, significant genotypic and biological diversity exists amongst these virus isolates. One virus isolate had the 5' untranslated region sequence of a group 1 virus but the protein profile and cellular tropism of a group 2 virus. The best explanation of these findings is that this anornolous isolate is a natural recombinant between the parented strains. Both the ease with which viable recombinants are generated and the diversity present within this one enterovirus serotype increase the potential for the production of novel pathogenic enterovirus strains.",

Benjamin, Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 021 15 Polyoma virus (F' y) is a mouse DNA tumor virus which, under appropriate conditions, causes tumors in a wide variety of cell types. Generation of tumors is a function of both the viral and host genomes. Lukacher et al. have recently described a dominant gene, Pyv', carried by the C3-i mouse strain, which confers susceptibility to PY-induced tumors Mapping and immunological analyses indicate that Py4 is the mouse mammary tumor virus 7 superantigen (Mtv 7 sad gene, which deletes T cells required for Py tumor immunosurveillance in H-2' mice. To determine the generality of endogenous superantigens as determinants of susceptibility and to reveal potentially novel mechanisms of susceptibility, we have looked for dominant Susceptibility @ S ) gene(s) id newly established and genetically diverse inbred wild mouse strains, Czech I1 and Pedatteck (Peru). Both strains are susceptible to PY as 100% of infected animals develop a full profile of tumors. Crosses between CS7BR, whose resistance is contributed by the major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, and susceptible Peru or Czech 11, yield F1 progeny which are fully susceptible, indicating a dominant inheritance pattern of susceptibility The incidence of tumor-bearing backcross animals [((Peru x CS7BR) x C57BR) and ((Czech I1 x CS7BR) x C57BR)I suggests that DS is due to at least one, but not more than two genes. Amplification of genomic DNA from the Czech I1 and Peru mice by PCR using primers specific for MTV 7 sag indicates that both strains are negative for proviral MTV 7 sag. Furthermore, the mechanism ofDS in these mice may be independent of all MTV sag as PCR using primers specific for the highly conserved region of MTV sag is unable to amplify MTV DNA from Peru or Czech I1 genomic DNA. These results indicate that, like the C3HiBi, the Pedatteck and Czech I1 contain gene(s) which overide the resistance to PY-induced tumors contributed by the MHC of the C57BR parent and which may cause tumors via a novel, MTV sag-independent mechanism. We have initiated efforts to map the DS in Peru and Czech I1 mice using PCR and primer pairs flanking simple sequence length polymorphisms. FIS-2 is a low leukemogenic, but relatively strong immunosuppressive variant of Friend Murine Leukemia Virus (F-MuLV). This variant was originally isolated from T-helper cells of FLC-infected adult NMRl mice. Compared to F-MuLV, FIS-2 suppresses primary antibody response more efficiently in infected mice. Some of the FTS-2 infected adult NMRI mice developed a disease resembling the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome induced by HIV. Restriction mapping and nucleotide sequence analysis of FIS-2 show a high degee of homology between this variant and the prototype F-MuLV clone 57.",

RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUAL VIRAL PROTEINS a) Expression Cloning: Structural and non-structural protein pseudogenes were cloned from cDNA by PCR. expressed in pGEX-3XUC. and purified by SDS-PAGE. b) Humoral: Structural and non-structural proteins were recognised by infected animals. A good anamneetic antinon-structural response was only observed when the boosting serotype differed from the serotype stimulating the primary response. c) Cellular: Both structural and non-structural proteins were recognised and some were cross reactive. Interestingly, VP1 was strain specific, and the polymerase (3D) was the most immunogenic and cross reactive. d) A construct comprising 3D and the immunodominant VP1 epitopes was prepared and tested. In common with other herpesviruses, the envelope glycoproteins of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1; equine abortion virus) are major determinants of the infectious process and pathogenicity, and are inducers of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. As such, they are candidates for components of subunit vaccines against EHV-1. To generate useful amounts of individual EHV-1 glycoproteins, we have constructed recombinant badoviruses capable of expressing glycoproteins C, D, H (gC, gD, gH ) in insect cells, and have evaluated the recombinant products as innnunogens in a murine model of EHV-1 infection. AU three glycoproteins induced serum (ELISA) antihodies to EHV-1, and EHV-1 gC and gD also induced neutralizing antibody responses. Following intranad challenge with infectious EHV-1, protective immunity, as demonstrated by acelerated clearance of virus fiom respiratory tissues to below detectable levels, was evident in mice immunized with either recombinant gC or gD. In contrast, gH-immmkd mice did not develop detectable neutralizing antibody, and did not clear challenge virus more rapidly than controls. Delayed type hypersensitivity and lymphoproliferation responses to EHV-1 antigen were observed for each of the EHV-1 glycoproteins, and in experiments with gDimmunized mice, a role for cell mediated immunity in protection was confirmed by adoptive transfer and T-cell depletion experiments. The data provide support for the potential of glycoproteins C and D as a subunit vaccine against EHV-1.",

Anthony A Nash, Department of Murine herpesvirus (MHV) 68, a gamma-herpesvirus, is a natural pathogen of small rodents. When MHV-68 is administered inuanasally to inbred mice, a productive infection is established in the lung, involving alveolar epithelium and mononuclear cells. Infection resolves in the lung by day 10, but the virus is maintained in B lymphocytes in a latent form. The number of latently infected B lymphocytes in the spleen rises dramatically between the 2nd and 3rd week post infection. Thereafter, the numbers decline, with approximately 1 in 10 5 virus positive lymphocytes detected 1 year later. Recovery from the primary infection is dependent upon CD8+ T cells, since their depletion result in an overwhelming infection of lung with spread of virus to other tissues. In contrast, CD4 T cells do not appear to regulate the infection in the lung, but are the major effector cell in the induction of splenomegaly, seen in MHV-68 infected mice. Another pathological feature of the infection is the induction of lymphomas, characterisxi by monoclonal B lymphocytes. The possibility that this disease arises from infected lymphocytes is strengthened by the ability of B cells taken from infected animals to spontaneously transform in v i m to generate cell lines. Many of the biological properties displayed by MHV-68 are similar to Epstein-Ban virus infection. The ability to genetically manipulate the virus and the host in order to define gene function, makes this a powerful model to study the interaction of a gamma-herpesvirus with its natural host.",

Virgin IV, Center for Immunology and Division of Infectious Diseases, Washington University School o f Medicine, St. Louis, M O 63110. The macrophage (M4) i s thought to play an important role in human and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. We therefore examined M.$ activation during M C M V infection. Intraperitoneal challenge with lo' p f u o f M C M V or lo6 pfu of herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV) resulted in an inflammatory infiltrate consisting largely o f M H C class I1 positive M6 in CB17 SCID mice on day 7 post infection. Increasing doses o f M C M V resulted in decreased M+ class I1 expression, with class I1 expression absent 7 days after infection with 10' p f u of M C M V . Limiting dilution analysis demonstrated that fewer than 1:250 M.$ was productively infected. However, preliminary in situ PCR results suggested that approximately 40% o f the peritoneal exudate cells contained M C M V genome. Infection o f normal CB17 mice with 10' pfu o f M C M V induced M.$ class I1 expression, suggesting that the specific immune response overcomes the lack o f class 11. Consistent with this, M4 from SCID mice reconstituted with M C M V immune spleen cells and challenged with 106 p f u o f M C M V , express high levels o f class 11. The deficiency in class I1 expression was M C M V specific, since several HSV-1 strains induced M.$ class I1 expression. M H C class I and I C A M -1 levels were increased on the class I1 negative M+, making general inhibition o f M q 5 cell surface protein expression unlikely. In vivo administration o f recombinant mouse IFNy induced high levels o f class I1 on M+ from SCID mice challenged with either H S V or u v inactivated M C M V , but not live M C M V . This suggests that M C M V infection inhibits IFNy induced M q 5 class I1 expression in the absence of specific immunity. This inhibition o f one component o f IFNy dependent M.$ activation has implications for the progression o f acute M C M V infection and viral latency. virus (HCV) is an emerging human pathogen. HCV infection in human can result in varied clinical outcomes including the establishment o f persistent infection which may lend to the development o f hepatocellular carcinoma. Persistent viral infections are increasingly being recogninzd as a significant causc of human morbidity and mortality. An important aspect o f viral persistence involves the evasion o f immunological surveillance. T o elucidate a potential mechanism involved i n immune modulation by the HCV. we have studied whether H C V gene product(s) has the inhibition effect on influenza H A antigen presentation to class I M H C restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). C T L is activated early in viral infection and plays a critical role i n the clearance of virus infection hy eliminating infected cells. Two vaccinia recombinant viruses, v H C V l and vHCV2. wcre tcsted for their ability to inhibit the recognition o f H A antigen by H Aspecific CTL. vHCV 1 expresses the structural proteins C, El, E2 as well as the nonstructunl proteins NS2 and a portion of NS3. vHCV2 expresses the nonstruetural proteins, a portion of NS2. NS3, NS4A. NS4B, NSSA, NSSB. When H A transfccted B cell lymphoma line (YG4) was infected with v H C V l or vHCV2 or vSCl I as a negative control, cells infected with v H C V l showed a dramatic reduction o f H A recognition by HA-specific C T L in contrast to vHCV2 or vSCl I infected YG4 cells. Thc level o f inhibition w~s rrproducihly i n a range o f 40% -60% relative to uninfecwd YG4 cells. However. v H C V l did not affect the charging o f peptides at the cell surfacc 01 antigen prcsenting cells. It suggests that HCV gene product(s) may interact with proteins involved in the antigen presentation machinery to inhibit the pnxntation o f endogenous antigen to CTL. It implicates that the protein involved in the presentation of C T L recognition may regulate the immune system leading to the estahlishrnent o f persistent viral infection. J2-130 DOWNREGULATION OF MHC CLASS I MOLECULES BY HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (HCMV): CMOKINES CONTROL THE ANTIGEN PRESENTATION FUNCTION. Hartmut Hengel'. Christine EBlinger', Jos Pool2, Els GoulmJ and Ulrich H. Koszinowski'. 'Department of Virology, University of Heidelberg. Germany, and 2DeparIment of lmmunohematology and Bloodbank, University Hospital, Leiden. The Netherlands. Infection wlth human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) results in a loss of surface expressed MHC class I molecules. The redudion of surface expressed MHC class I molecules is selective since other surface molecules like CD54 (ICAM-l), CD71 (transfenin receptor) or C M 4 (pgpl) are not affected. Steady state levels of MHC class I complexes and unassembled MHC class I heavy chains are found largely decreased, whereas free Dpnicmglobulin remains abundant. To determine the functional conseguences of this viral effect, CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones with specificity for defined minor and major histocompatibility antigens were used to monitor antigen presentation in HCMV-infeded cells. At the immediate early stage of virus replication the antigen presentation function was intact, but at the early and late phase of the viral replication cycle the presentation of all antigens tested was abolished. Remarkably. interferom (IFM) and tumor necrosis factora (TNFa) counteracted the impaired MHC class I complex formation by a strong increase in MHC class I synthesis and assembly. This resulted in a rescue of the peplide and allc4HC class I presentation. The effect of the cytokines required the exposure of cells to the factors before HCMV infedion. Although the cytokines compensated the negative viral effed on the antigen presentation function, the viral interference with MHC class I complex formation was still actiie. Thus the cytokine effect upon antien presentation dd not act through antiviral activities but was associated with the induction of MHC class I genes of the host.",

When both 10.4K and 14.7K are deleted there is a marked incmsc in alveolar pathogenesis that parallels the in v i m protection of v i d y infected cells against TNF cytolysis. The specific immune response is altend by another E3 protein, gpl9K. Gpl9K prevents CIL recognition in v i m and was expected to alter the cellular infilmtion caused by C n s and perhaps even prevent in vivo CIL priming.

UK. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognise peptide antigens presented by class I MHC. However, it remains to be determined whether post-translationally modified peptides also are presented f o r recognition by T cells. In order to address this issue, we studied the immunogenicity and MHC restricted recognition of a synthetic glycopeptide carrying an 0-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) monosaccharide substituted serine. This glycosylation of cellular and viral proteins is catalysed by a recently described cytosolic glycosyltransferase. We have demonstrated that glycosylation did not reduce peptide binding to MHC class I and that glycopeptides elicited a strong CTL response which is MHC restricted and glycopeptide specific. Furthermore, glycopeptide recognition by CTL is dependent on the structure of the glycan as well as its position within the peptide. Our data show that post-translational modifications of peptides may constitute part of the natural T cell repertoire. Furthermore, acquisition or loss of glycosylation might be a novel viral mechanism f o r masking of epitopes or the creation of neo-epitopes. Ongoing work in our laboratories is now aimed at determining whether glycosylated peptides may be presented by MHC in vivo.

CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes detect virally infected cells by recognizing a processed viral peptide associated with class I MHC molecules. The generation of antigenic peptides from cytoplasmic or nuclear antigens for class I presentation is thought to require the cytoplasmic degradation of antigen, possibly by a proteasome complex, and peptide transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a heterodimeric complex of the MHC-encoded Tap-I and Tap-2 genes thereby allowing for peptide-MHC complex assembly within the ER. I t remains unclear for viral glycoproteins if cytoplasmic degradation and Tap transport are required processing events. The cotranslational translocation of viral glycoproteins into the ER and subsequent antigen degradation within the ER would result in a Tap-independent antigen processing pathway. The RMA-S cell line has a mutation in the Tap-2 gene resulting in the functional disruption of peptide transport from the cytoplasm into the ER. Using the RMA-S cell line transfected with the MHC class I Kd gene, we show that processing of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein for presentation to a panel of Kd restricted CTL is dramatically inhibited by the disruption of Tap function. Residual and highly inefficient Kd charging in the RMA-S/Kd cell can be elicited both with influenza virus as well as recombinant Sindbis virus expression vectors canying influenza HA gene fragments encompassing known Kd epitopes.

Haller, Melissa, L. Barkon, and Herbert W. Virgii IV, Center for Immunology and Division of Infections Diseases, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis MO, 63110. We evaluated the clearance of reovirus serotype 3 Clone 9 (T3C9) from the small intestine of normal or immunodeficient adult mice after oral inoculation. CB17, 129, and C57BU6 mice clear reovirus T3C9 completely from the proximal small intestine 11 days after oral inoculation. In contrast, SCID mice on either the C57BU6 or CB17 background fail to clear virus from intestine and ultimately succumb to infection. Adoptive transfer of immune spleen cells allowed SCID mice to control intestinal infection. To evaluate the role of CD8 T cells, immunoglobulin, and B cells in clearance of intestinal infection, we challenged 82microglobulin and immunoglobulin knockout mice (82KO and IgKO respectively) with T3C9. &?KO mice cleared infection with normal kinetics. In contrast, IgKO mice failed to clear intestinal virus efficiently, with signifhut viral titers in intestine 11 days after infection. To investigate the mechanism of inefficient clearance in IgKO mice, we adoptively transferred antibody to IgKO and SCID mice 3 and 5 days after oral infection with T3C9. Intraperitoneal transfer of reovirus-iiune polyclonal rabbit serum, but not pre-immune serum, completely cleared reovirus from intestine of IgKO mice 11 days after infection. The same antibody signiricantly decreased virus titer in intestines of SCID mice 11 days after infection. Adoptive transfer of a mouse monoclonal IgG2a antibody specifii for the reovirus outer capsid protein 03 also cleared IgKO mouse intestinal reovirus infection. We are currently evaluating other knockout mice and performing cell transfer studies to further dissect mechanisms of intestinal virus clearance. Our studies in &KO mice challenge the notion that circulating IgG is unimportant for clearance of virus from mucosal surfaces.

Welsh, Dept.of Pathology, Univ.of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA 01655 In scidhcid (SCID) mice polyomavirus (PyV) induces an acute hematological disease with 100% mortality by day 16 post infection. PyV does not cause a comparable disease in immunocompetent or nude mice, but it induces a wide array of epithelial and mesenchymd tumors in neonatally infected mice, and mainly mammary tumors in adult, nude mice. In order to determine which component of the immune system is playing a major role in the protection of mice from the PyV-induced acute hematological disease, we performed two types of experiments. (i) Mice with different types of immunodeficiencies (SCID, a0 knockout (KO), y6 KO, B cell KO) andlor depleted of certain cell populations (CD4 f ,CD8 + ,asialo-GM, + (AGM,) or NKl . 1 +) in vivo, were infected with PyV. (ii) SCID mice were adoptively transferred with splenocytes from immunocompetent, or from immunodeficient (a0 KO; B cell KO) mice, or with the Same splenocytes in vitro depleted with anti-Thy-1 and/or anti-AGM, antibodies, then infected with PyV. Both types of experiments clearly showed that, in the absence of a0 T cells or of a0 T cells and NK cells, the presence of B cells protected mice from the PyVinduced hematological disease. This was accompanied by a major reduction in the amount of virus in different organs. At day 4 post infection PyV DNA was detected in the spleens but not in other organs of SCID mice, or of SCID mice adoptively transferred with splenocytes with or without Thy-1 depletion. However, at day 14 post infection, while in SCID mice all four major organs tested (spleen, kidney, liver, lung) contained a strong virus-specific band, no viral signal was detected in SCID mice adoptively transferred with B or with T and B cells. Transfer of immune serum raised in PyV-infected a0 KO mice,(but not serum from uninfected mice) delayed the onset of acute disease by 4 weeks. Ig fractions responsible for this protective effect are being analyzed. Our result indicate that B cells can mount an effective response against PyV in the absence of af? T cells and NK cells.",

Such resistance was apparently specific for HSV infection, since a second group of survivors succumbed to a lethal infection of mCMV.

            "text": "NORTH AMERICA. Bruce Anderson, Teny Yates, Norah Torrez-Martinez, Wanmin Song, Brian Hjelle. University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, N.M.We recently identified a new species of hantavirus (HMV) associated with the harvest mouse Reithrodontomys megalotis (Hjelle B et al, J. ViroJ. 1994, in press ). An Arizona woodrat (Neotoma mexicana) was found to he infected with HMV, presumably through \"spillover\". HMV is most closely related to the Four Comers hantavirus (FCV) of deer mice (genus Peromyscus). The nucleocapsid gene and protein of HMV differ from those of FCV by 24% and 15% of residues, and the 1896 nt S genome is shorter by 163 nt. We surveyed 174 Reithrodontomys animals captured in the U.S. and Mexico for hantavirus antibodies; 27 (15.6%) were positive. S segment cDNAs were amplified and sequenced from seropositive animals captured in California (4), Arizona (3), New Mexico (l), and Mexico (2). A monophyletic clade of HMV-like agents was identified at all sites, although an R. megalotis infected with an FCV-like virus was also identified in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. Nucleotide sequence distances among members of the HMV clade were up to 15.5%. but amino acid distances were less than 2%. HMV is enzootic in harvest mice throughout much of North America, and can also infect wood rats. HTLV I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAMnSP) is a slowly pro ressive neurological disease characterized by perivascuaar mononuclear infiltrates in the CNS. HTLV I-specific CD8+ CTL are found in PBL and CSF of infected patients with HTLV I-associated neurological disease but not in HTLV I seropositive individuals without neurological involvement. Previous studies have shown that in HLA-A2+ patients, HTLV I-specific CD8+ CTL restricted by HLA-A2 recognize a peptide derived from the HTLV I Tax protein (Tax 11-19 LLFGYPVW). In the present study, we have analyzed the potential of these Tax-specific CTL to recognize addtional peptides. Our results demonstrate that a subpopulation of high affinity CD8' Tax 11-19 specific CTL clones cross-react on a self peptide derived from the se uence of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG 556-564 VL&SDFRI) presented by HLA-A2. These ObSeNatlOnS suggest that the demyelination process in HAMlTSP may be,due, in part, to virus-specific CTL recognition of a self myelin component that is independent of HTLV I infection. Development of pathology varies widely between different strains of mice after intracerebral inoculation with the so-called 'docile' isolate of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. The C3HeBFeJ and BlO.BR/SgSnJ mouse strains have been of special interest because they display autoimmune hemolytic anaemia with varying degrees of apparent immunological involvement. In this study, we examined the role of CD4+ T helper cells in this autoimmune response by treating mice with the CW-specific GK1.5 monoclonal antibody. We also determined if polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes, induced either by LCM virus or by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, another well known B cell activator, correlated with the development of anaemia in these mice. Our results strengthened the central role of the immune system in the anaemia in C3H mice by showing that depletion of CD4+ cells largely, if not completely, abrogated this anti-erythrocyte autoimmune reaction. As reported by others, we found that the anaemia was more mild in B 1O.BR mice than in C3H mice. However, we could not confirm the difference in the degree of B lymphocyte polyclonal activation between these mice. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus had no apparent effect on erythrocytes, even though this virus also induced a sharp increase in plasma IgG levels. One of the two class I MHC (H-PKd)-restricted immunogenic sites identified on the influenza strain AIJapanl57 (H2N2) hemagglutinin (HA) encompasses two distinct partially overlapping epitopes, mapping to residues 204-212 and 210.219. When we investigated the magnitude of the CTL responses of BALWc mice to the two overlapping epitopes, we found that while the NHrterminal nonamer epitope is immunodominant, eliciting vigorous CTL responses in NJapanl57-immunized BALB/c mice, the CTL responses to the COOH-terminal decamer epitope are weak and variable. The C-terminal epitope subdominance seems to be due to factors other than inefficient processing of the epitope in vivo because CTLs generated by priming mice with recombinant Sindbis viruses expressing only one of the HA 204-219 subsites displayed patterns of responsiveness similar to that of influenza virus primed CTLs. Limiting dilution CTL assays showed that the CTL precursor frequency (pCTL) of the Nterminal epitope is at least ten fold higher than the pCTL of the Cterminal epitope, implying that the low and variable pattern of Cterminal specific responsiveness was due to the limited T cell precursors in the C-terminal specific CTL repertoire. This was further confirmed by the limited heterogeneity in the cross reactivity patterns displayed by the C-terminal specific CTL for an Ig VH fragment and the HA 210-219 epitope of influenza strain A I M 5 7 in short term bulk cultures, and the FACS analysis of TCR Vg chain usage. Taking these together with our previous observation that some JHA 210-219 specific CTLs can also crossrecognize an Ig VH fragment. these studies had provided a strong evidence that Ig gene products may influence T lymphocyte function and repertoire development. We have previously described the identification of homologous regions in the C-terminus of HIV-1 gp41 and in the N-terminus of HLA class I1 beta chains. Forty percent of patients infected with HIV-I virus were shown to have antibodies which bind to the homologous sequences, as well as to native HLA class I1 molecules. Affinity purified crossreactive antibodies (CrAb) were shown to have direct blocking effects on normal T cell responses to recall antigens, and could mediate ADCC of HLA class II+ cell lines.In order to determine the contribution of such antibodies to disease progression, we obtained longitudinal plasma samples from patients in the MACS study. In a first study, it was found that the presence of high titers CrAbs correlated with a more rapid disease progression (P = 0.027 by Fisher two tail analysis)In a second, 7 year-longitudinal study of 12 progre.ssors and 12 stable patients we found: (1) The production of CrAb was seen in 70 -80% of rapid progresson, while the true stables produce only infrequent low-titers CrAb. (2) In rapid pmgressors, production of CrAb preceded by 2-3 years the marked drop in CD4 counts. (3) CrAb production did not correlate with the degree of hyperglobulinemia in these patients. (4) The presence of CrAb during the asymptomatic stage correlated with early loss of T-helper responses to recall antigens.We are currently establishing whether periodic measurements of CrAb in patients sera could be valuable in predicting a drop in CD4 counts and disease progression. The lymphokine IFN-y is I pleiotropic insnunomodulator and possesses intrinsic antiviral activity. We studied its significance in the development of antiviral immune responses using IFN-7 receptor deficient (IFN-yR-'.) mice. After inoculation with live attenuated pseudorabies virus (PRV) the mutant mice showed no infectivity titers in various tissues and transient viral Ag expression only in the spleen similar as in wild-type mice. However, the absence of the IFN-yR resulted in increased proliferative splenocyte responses. The PRV-immune animals showed a normal IFN-1 and 11-2 production, without detectable 11-4, and with decreased 11-10 secretion in response to viral Ag or con A. Immunohistochemically, an increased ratio of IFNy/I1-4 producing spleen cells was found. After immunization with either live attenuated or inactivated PRV, IFN-yR\"' mice produced significantly less antiviral antibody (Ab), and more succumbed to challenge infection than the intact control animals. The reduction in Ah titers in the mutant mice correlated with lower protection by their sera in transfer experiments. Thes? findings are in line with the strong enhancing effect of exogenous IFN-y on rabies virusand PRV-specific IgG responses. Our data demonstrate that a physiological IFN-y system is surprisingly not critical for the generation of antiviral Th-I-type and the suppression of Th-2-type cytokine responses. The lymphokine, however, is an important mediator in the generation of protective antiviral Ab.",
