Furthermore, year 3 NSs had the lowest SPs compliance in the 4-year undergraduate program. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing is a 4-year program in Hong Kong. First- and second-year NSs are supervised by university clinical instructors, whereas second-year specialty and third- and fourth-year students were supervised by nursing staff in the clinical venue. It would be logical for the first year NSs to follow the SPs taught in the school because they were supervised by university clinical instructors. However, it is noteworthy that NSs were particularly affected by the nursing staff in the ward in their second and third year but not fourth year of clinical placement. Perhaps, the qualitative interview study results37 conducted in the UK might provide some explanations. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing is a 3-year program in the UK, but only second- and third-year NSs were involved in the Ward study.37 The study results found that poor practice by nursing staff observed by the NSs could have both negative and positive effects on their infection control practices. Some NSs would lower their infection control standards to fit in with the ward practice, whereas some would reflect on the poor practice observed and strive to maintain a high level of infection control practice. Furthermore, NSs' confidence on their infection control practice accumulated over their course of study, and this also increased their possibility of reporting poor infection control practice.37 This might explain why fourth-year NSs were not as affected by nursing staff as much as those in their second and third years because they have the confidence to practice what they believe as the proper infection control practices.",

The purpose of the HBM is to identify the factors which can improve the likelihood of compliance to SPs among NSs. However, the underlying reasons why NSs might be affected by those factors might not be well explained by the HBM. Theory-in-use38 might shine some light on the explanation of such findings in the present study. To apply the theory in the context of SPs compliance, theory-in-use is the performance of the behaviors related to the SPs compliance, whereas espoused theory is to explain or justify the behaviors related to the SPs compliance. Argyris and Schon38 explained that theory-in-use (ie, actual practice and self-reported practice) of an individual worker is shaped by espoused theory, that is, his/her formal (eg, policies, guidelines) and informal (eg, observation, organizational culture) learning in the workplace. In terms of SPs compliance among NSs, increasing SPs knowledge, providing more SPs training, promoting a safety climate (management support), reducing identified SPs barriers, and improving nursing staff compliance to SPs would enhance NSs' SPs compliance.",

Both qualitative studies in the UK37, 39 found that NSs intended to fit in with the clinical practices even though they knew the clinical staff did not comply with the SPs. In addition, NSs worried that their clinical performance evaluation would be negatively affected if they confronted the clinical staff about their improper infection control practices.39 As a result, a comprehensive supporting program empowering students is recommended. Before clinical placement, assertiveness training39 coupled with communication skills is suggested to empower NSs to handle challenges in the hierarchical clinical placement environment. Simultaneously, workshops for clinical mentors are recommended to inform them of the intended learning outcomes of the clinical placement and the expectations of the programs. The evidence-based effect of role modeling of clinical mentors to NSs would be emphasized in the workshops.",

Further studies using an observational design might be an alternative approach where NSs are observed objectively by an observer to determine their SPs compliance. In addition, further research should be conducted to explore the phenomena of the influence of nursing staff on NSs in the clinical settings. In addition, current studies seem to indicate that NSs have higher SPs compliance than nursing staff. After graduating from their university studies, at what point does compliance of SPs of junior nursing staff start to decline? Are they influenced by the existing senior nursing staff in the unit? What is the influence of the organizational culture? Answering these questions might shine light to establish appropriate strategies to improve the SPs compliance among nursing staff.",
