            "text": "Vaccination is an extremely important public health measure that has demonstrated prophylactic and therapeutic utility against many infectious diseases, [1] [2] [3] and impacted some forms of cancer. [4] In the past decade, advances in material engineering have allowed for the development and study of a new generation of nano particle vaccines. [5] [6] [7] Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are such examples of self-assembling viruslike particles (VLPs) that have impacted millions of people. [8, 9] Nanoparticles may come in several shapes and forms. Inorganic materials, [10, 11] nontoxic phospholipids, [12] VLPs, or self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SAPN) [13] [14] [15] [16] can scaffold and present antigens in repetitive multimeric manners to robustly stimulate immunity in animal models. [16] [17] [18] However, some intrinsic production challenges have impeded broader translation of nanovaccines into the clinical space. [19, 20] VLP vaccines are often produced at low yields in mammalian cell lines and are difficult to purify, requiring Nanotechnologies are considered to be of growing importance to the vaccine field. Through decoration of immunogens on multivalent nanoparticles, designed nanovaccines can elicit improved humoral immunity. However, significant practical and monetary challenges in large-scale production of nanovaccines have impeded their widespread clinical translation. Here, an alternative approach is illustrated integrating computational protein modeling and adaptive electroporation-mediated synthetic DNA delivery, thus enabling direct in vivo production of nanovaccines. DNA-launched nanoparticles are demonstrated displaying an HIV immunogen spontaneously self-assembled in vivo. DNA-launched nanovaccines induce stronger humoral responses than their monomeric counterparts in both mice and guinea pigs, and uniquely elicit CD8+ effector T-cell immunity as compared to recombinant protein nanovaccines. Improvements in vaccine responses recapitulate when DNAlaunched nanovaccines with alternative scaffolds and decorated antigen are designed and evaluated. Finally, evaluation of functional immune responses induced by DLnanovaccines demonstrates that, in comparison to control mice or mice immunized with DNA-encoded hemagglutinin monomer, mice immunized with a DNA-launched hemagglutinin nanoparticle vaccine fully survive a lethal influenza challenge, and have substantially lower viral load, weight loss, and influenza-induced lung pathology. Additional study of these next-generation in vivo-produced nanovaccines may offer advantages for immunization against multiple disease targets.",

[13, 21, 22] Production of HPV VLPs, for example, requires three sequential purification steps of strong cation exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and hydroxyapatite chromatography. [23] Large-scale production of liposome-based nanovaccines is challenging, as slight variations in the methods of production result in heterogeneity of the liposomes produced. [19] Production of nanovaccines for a global market could, therefore, requires specialized pipelines that raise costs. In addition, regulatory approval of drugs for use in humans can be complex for the development of multicomponent nanomedicines. [24] Technologies that would allow de novo nanoparticle assemblies in the hosts from materials that are inexpensive, simple, and stable, which bypass these complex biochemical processes and downstream purifications, may be of interest.",

            "text": "In this regard, computational protein engineering is an extremely powerful tool and has facilitated the design of novel biologics [25] as well as specific potent nanovaccines. [15, 26] One such example is the eOD-GT8-60mer, which is a priming immunogen engineered to activate precursors of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies. [27] [28] [29] When scaffolded with the C-terminus of the lumazine synthase (LS) enzyme from Aquifex aeolicus, eOD-GT8 can assemble into a 60 mer nanoparticle to induce stronger humoral immunity and higher frequencies of antigen-specific IgG + memory B cells. [27] In terms of vaccine delivery, DNA vaccines have been studied for induction of humoral and cellular immunity. [30] [31] [32] Additionally, delivery of optimized DNA plasmids encoding monomeric immunogens via adaptively controlled electroporation (EP) [33] can result in 1000-fold enhancement of in vivo expression and longer-term in vivo production of the encoded antigens. [34] [35] [36] The newer DNA platform is also a robust method of eliciting adaptive immune responses in humans, having demonstrated immune potency in the clinic against such diseases as Zika, Ebola, HIV, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and clinical efficacy against HPV-driven cervical dysplasia. [4, [37] [38] [39] [40] While simple multimerization domains, such as heptamer domain IMX313P, have been employed to improve DNA vaccine responses, [41, 42] we explored and expanded upon this concept focusing on induction of both B-and T-cell responses to large computationally designed nanoparticles (24, 60 , and 180 mers) decorated with a variety of antigens. eOD-GT8-60mer is currently being clinically evaluated as a recombinant protein vaccine, [43] and was examined as a prototype for DNA delivery. We discovered that the DNA-Launched nanoparticle Lumazine Synthase decorated with an anti-HIV-1 immunogen eOD-GT8 (eOD-GT8-60mer in the literature, [29] herein referred as DLnano_LS_GT8) could assemble in vivo into nanoparticles. DLnano_LS_GT8 induced stronger humoral responses than corresponding DNA-launched monomeric GT8 (DLmono_GT8) both in mice and guinea pigs, and also uniquely elicited CD8+ T-cell immunity unlike the corresponding protein nanovaccines. We computationally designed alternative nanoparticle scaffolds and utilized different immunogens to evaluate this approach more broadly. Consistent improvements in the induction of adaptive immune responses were observed across multiple constructs, which was further shown to confer significant benefits in protecting mice from lethal influenza challenge. Synthetic DNA/electroporation (DNA/EP) technology can, therefore, be used to direct in vivo assembly of computationally designed nanovaccines, which elicit more potent functional immunological responses. This combination is likely important for rapid development of vaccines and immunotherapies.",

We engineered the GT8 constructs to incorporate an optimized human IgE-leader sequence [34] and found the in vitro intracellular expression of this construct to be strongly enhanced as compared to GT8 constructs without any leader sequence (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). We therefore used the IgE constructs for subsequent experiments. In addition, reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of transfection supernatants supported that both plasmidencoded GT8-monomer and eOD-GT8-60mer could be secreted ( Figure S1b , Supporting Information). Lectin-purified protein eOD-GT8-60mer eluted as a homogenous fraction by SEC ( Figure S1c , Supporting Information).

MBL is a protein that can form hexamer and preferentially bind to highly repeated glycan structures on a pathogen/antigen surface. [44] A recent study by Tokatilian et al. demonstrated that only highly multimerized glycan structures (eOD-GT8-60mer but not eOD-GT8-monomer) could bind to MBL. [26] In our study, we similarly showed using ELISA that while VRC01 could bind to both protein GT8-60mer and GT8monomer, murine MBL could only bind to protein GT8-60mer but not protein GT8-monomer ( Figure S1d ,e, Supporting Information). Using this assay as multimerization readout, we demonstrated that in vivo-produced DLnano_LS_GT8, but not DLmono_GT8, could bind to MBL ( Figure S1f ,g, Supporting Information). Further, we observed that DLnano_LS_GT8 could be strongly labeled by endogenous murine MBL via an immunohistochemistry experiment ( Figure 1g ).",

Clusters of gold-labeled macromolecules suggestive of in vivo-launched nanoparticles decorated with multiple copies of GT8 were only observed in mice injected with DLnano_LS_GT8 but not with DLmono_GT8 ( Figure 1h ; Figure S1h , Supporting Information). In DLnano_LS_GT8-immunized mice, these clusters often had a valency greater than 10 ( Figure 1i ). We expected some reduction in labeling valency due to both steric hindrance in binding of VRC01 to individual GT8 subunits and limited solvent exposure on nanoparticle surfaces with thin sample sectioning. Quantitative measurements of the orders of clusters in different fields of interests demonstrated that partially formed (orders between 5 and 8) and well-formed (orders no less than 9) nanoparticles were significantly more frequent in mice treated with DLnano_ LS_GT8 than with DLmono_GT8, confirming in vivo assembly of these complex nanovaccines ( Figure S1i , Supporting Information).",

            "text": "Using immunofluorescence staining with VRC01 (green), we determined that DLnano_LS_GT8 trafficked more efficiently to the draining lymph node and colocalized with the CD35+ follicular dendritic cells (in blue) in contrast with the DLmono_ GT8 7 d.p.i. (Figure 2a) . This observation is consistent with recent findings on trafficking of recombinant protein nanoparticle vaccines. [26] To determine whether improved immunogen trafficking correlated with enhanced adaptive immunity, we followed humoral responses in immunized BALB/c mice. After 7 d.p.i., we found that DLnano_LS_GT8 induced more rapid GT8-directed seroconversion than DLmono_GT8 (Figure 2b) . Decoration of the GT8-antigens on the LS nanoparticle core is essential for the observed early response as cotransfection of mice muscles with 1:1 ratio of DLmono_GT8 and DNA-encoded LS core (DLnano_LS_core) did not lead to seroconversion at this timepoint ( Figure S2a , Supporting Information). We next examined whether GT8 scaffolded with a simpler multimerization domain, IMX313P, would perform similarly. Heptameric DNA-encoded GT8-IMX313P (DL_GT8_IMX313P) led to limited seroconversion at 7 d.p.i., but the induced antibody titer was 6.9-fold lower than that of DLnano_LS_GT8 ( Figure S2b , Supporting Information). Antigen-specific circulating IgMs can play a role in protection from challenge. [45] Here, we measured induced IgM responses and found that DLnano_ LS_GT8 induced stronger IgM responses than DLmono_GT8 with two immunizations ( Figure S2c , Supporting Information). Further, the IgG titers were 1.3-log and 1.8-log higher for DLnano_LS_GT8 with single immunization ( Figure S2d , Supporting Information) or two immunizations (Figure 2c ), respectively. Consistent with this observation, we found the frequency of CD19+IgD-IgM-IgG+ GT8 antigen-specific B cells in the spleens of mice immunized with DLnano_LS_GT8 to be 5.3-fold higher relative to mice immunized with DLmono_ GT8 (Figure 2d ), even though relatively few CD19+IgD-IgM-IgG+GT8-24mer+GT8-tetramer+ B cells have been recovered per million splenocytes analyzed ( Figure S2e , Supporting Information). DLnano_LS_GT8 retained folding and presentation of a key conformational epitope in vivo, as elicited murine antibodies could outcompete VRC01 binding to GT8 in competition of ELISA ( Figure S2f , Supporting Information, and Figure 2e ). A striking dose-sparing effect was observed for DLnano_LS_ GT8. While humoral responses were remarkably attenuated for DLmono_GT8 at 2 and 10 \u00b5g doses ( Figure S2g , Supporting Information), DLnano_LS_GT8 given at 2, 10, or 25 \u00b5g doses all induced similar levels of antibody responses ( Figure S2h , Supporting Information). Importantly, differences in antibody responses induced by DLnano_LS_GT8 and DLmono_GT8 were probably not solely due to increased antigen expression for DLnano_LS_GT8 (Figure 1e ), as DLnano_LS_GT8 still outperformed DLmono_GT8 at less than one-tenth of the monomer dose (Figure 2f ).",

BALB/c mice relative to DLmono_GT8. Finally, in guinea pigs, a single 50 \u00b5g intradermal (ID) vaccination of DLnano_LS_GT8 remarkably induced seroconversion 7 d.p.i. and 1.2-log higher antibody titers than DLmono_GT8 over time ( Figure 2h ). We proceeded with studies of ID vaccination in guinea pigs as ID delivery has additional advantages of simplicity, improved tolerability, and being dose sparing. [38, 40] We next compared the antibody responses induced by protein eOD-GT8-60mer and DLnano_LS_GT8. Protein eOD-GT8-60mer was subcutaneously administered in mice to be consistent with prior studies involving administration of this immunogen to mice; [27, 28] further, a relative high protein dose of 10 \u00b5g was used in this study as compared to prior study for protein versus DNA comparison. [26] We observed that two sequential immunizations of protein eOD-GT8-60mer co-formulated with Sigma Adjuvant System or DLnano_LS_GT8 in C57BL/6 mice induced similar humoral responses (Figure 2i ). It has been recently reported that uptake and trafficking of protein-based nanoparticles are dependent on the MBL complement pathway. [26, 46] We explored whether DNA-launched nanoparticles depended on a similar mechanism. Similar to previous reports, [26] humoral responses elicited by proteinbased GT8 nanoparticles in transgenic MBL and CR2 knockout mice were attenuated as compared to the wildtype C57BL/6 mice 7 d.p.i. (Figure 2j ). Strikingly, similar humoral responses were induced in the MBL or CR2 knockout mice as compared to the wildtype C57BL/6 mice by DLnano_LS_GT8 (Figure 2j ), highlighting DLnano immunogens may act independently of MBL-complement pathway, potentially through redundant mechanisms of antigen presentation.",

Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) revealed that the scaffolding LS domain drove predominantly CD4+ responses, since a higher proportion of effector memory CD3+CD4+CD44+CD62L-T-cells produced IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-2 when stimulated by the LS peptides than by GT8 peptides (Figure 3b ; Figure S3a ,b, Supporting Information). In contrast, we found that effector memory CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L-T cells induced by DLnano_LS_GT8 were more reactive to the GT8 domain than to the LS domain. DLnano_LS_GT8 induced more antigen-specific effector memory CD8+ T-cells that expressed activation cytokines IFN\u03b3 and exhibited effector phenotypes (CD107a+) than DLmono_GT8 in BALB/c mice (Figure 3c -e).",

To determine the ability of DLnano_LS_GT8 to elicit T-cell responses to the antigenic domain in a model with more diverse HLA haplotypes, we used the outbred CD1 mice and found that DLnano_LS_GT8 induced stronger CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T-cell responses to the GT8 domain than DLmono_GT8 ( Figure S3f -h, Supporting Information).

Using the crystal structures of ferritin from Helicobacter pylori (3BVE, a 24 mer), and PfV viral cage from Pyrococcus furiosus (2e0z, a 180-mer), we modeled GT8 at various geometries relative to the particle surface and designed appropriate flexible linkers. 3BVE-GT8 homogeneously assembled into spherical nanoparticles by nsEM ( Figure S4a , Supporting Information, and Figure 4a ). For PfV_GT8, we observed mixed species, but the predominant peak at 9.14 mL retention time, which accounted for approximately 60% of overall intensity, corresponded to torusshaped nanoparticle by nsEM ( Figure S4b , Supporting Information, and Figure 4b ). To demonstrate decoration of the designed nanoparticles with GT8, recombinantly produced protein 3BVE_GT8, eOD-GT8-60mer and PfV_GT8 were all tested and observed to bind to VRC01 ( Figure S4c , Supporting Information). Immunofluorescence demonstrated that both DLnano_3BVE_GT8 and DLnano_PfV_GT8 expressed in vivo 4 d.p.i. (Figure 4c ), even though in vivo expression of DLnano_PfV_GT8 was found to be stronger on average than DLnano_3BVE_GT8 by SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 4d ). Functionally, BALB/c mice immunized with DLnano_3BVE_GT8, DLnano_LS_GT8 and DLnano_PfV_GT8 all rapidly seroconverted 7 d.p.i. and mounted stronger antibody responses over the 5 week period than mice immunized with DLmono_GT8 ( Figure 4e ). In addition, BALB/c mice immunized with two doses of DLnano_3BVE_GT8, DLnano_LS_GT8, and DLnano_ PfV_GT8 all developed stronger CD8+ effector memory T-cell responses to the antigenic GT8 domain than those immunized with DLmono_GT8 by IFN\u03b3 ELIspot and ICS assays (Figure 4f ; Figure S4d ,e, Supporting Information).",

A dose-sparing phenomenon was observed for DLnano_LS_HA_NC99, as at a remarkably low plasmid vaccine dose of 1 \u00b5g, DLnano_LS_HA_NC99 induced significantly stronger humoral responses in BALB/c mice than DLmono_HA_NC99 (Figure 5c ). Hemagglutinin inhibition titers (HAI) against the autologous NC99 strain were found to be higher than 1:40 (which correlated with 50% reduction in the risk of infections in humans [47] ) in 100% of mice immunized with two doses of DLnano_LS_GT8 and 0% in mice immunized with two doses of DLmono_HA_NC99 Additionally, in terms of elicited cellular responses, two immunizations of DLnano_LS_HA_NC99 induced 8.4-fold higher effector memory CD8+ T-cell responses than DLmono_ HA_NC99 at 10 \u00b5g dose in terms of CD107a and IFN\u03b3 expression, similar to our prior findings (Figure 5f ; Figure S5c ,d, Supporting Information).",

We constructed a ferritin-scaffolded receptor-binding domain of hemagglutinin from H1/ California/07/09 strain, DLnano_3BVE_HA_CA09, that was leader sequence, codon, and mRNA-optimized as compared to a previously reported construct. [48] We first confirmed its in vitro assembly into nanoparticles by SEC and nsEM ( Figure S6a ,b, Supporting Information). We then immunized three groups of mice twice with minimal doses (1 \u00b5g) of DNA encoding either DLmono_HA_CA09, DLnano_3BVE_HA_CA09, or control backbone pVAX vector 3 weeks apart. We observed improved induction of binding antibody responses in mice immunized with DLnano_3BVE_HA_CA09 than those with DLmono_HA_ CA09 (Figure 6a) . Five weeks after the first immunization, we observed significant eightfold improvement in HAI titers in mice immunized with DLnano_3BVE_HA_CA09 than those with DLmono_HA_CA09 (Figure 6b ). We then set up two lethal influenza challenge experiments in these three groups of mice, 5 weeks after the final immunization. Each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 10LD 50 homologous H1/California/07/09 virus and was followed up for 2 weeks for weight loss. Any mouse losing more than 20% of baseline body weight would have met the humane endpoint for euthanasia. In this experiment, we observed only mice immunized with DLnano_3BVE_ HA_CA09 fully survived the lethal challenge (Figure 6c ), whereas 40% (2/5) of mice immunized with DLmono_HA_ CA09 or 100% (5/5) of mice immunized with control pVAX backbone succumbed to infections. Additionally, among mice that survived the challenge, substantially lower weight loss was observed in mice immunized with DLnano_3BVE_HA_CA09 than DLmono_HA_CA09 (Figure 6d) .",

            "text": "Development of vaccines can be a challenging endeavor due to poor immunogenicity of certain vaccine antigens, which results in the need to increase the number of required vaccinations, dose per vaccination, and the required interval for patients to complete the vaccine regime. Particulate vaccine formulations can help boost immunogenicity but can be slow to develop on a large scale due to manufacturing complexities. Synthetic nucleic-acid-based methods for the delivery of vaccine antigens have shown great promises, as they are often produced at significantly lower costs than their protein counterparts, can be manufactured to scale and bypass complex processes of assembly, [49] offer superior safety profile, [50] and demonstrate remarkable thermostability to allow for extended shelf-lives. [51] In this study, through the use of computational modeling and biophysical characterization, we engineered multimeric forms of HIV and influenza antigens that folded properly in vitro and displayed the desired antigenic profiles. We showed that these designer nanovaccines can assemble in vivo when delivered using synthetic DNA and adaptive EP, through direct evidence from pseudo-native PAGE analysis ( Figure 1f ) and transmission electron microscopy (Figure 1h,i) , and indirect evidence of binding of murine MBL to in vivo produced DLnano_LS_GT8 but not to DLmono_GT8 (Figure 1g ). The in vivo nanoparticle assembly resulted in improved antigen trafficking and induction of potent adaptive immune responses, including rapid seroconversion, higher binding, and functional HAI antibody titers yet with significant dose sparing. Enhanced antibody responses were also induced when DLnanovaccine was administered via ID DNA vaccination, a newer and clinically important route of DNA vaccination. [37, 40] Importantly, enhanced immune responses induced by DLnanovaccines also conferred functional advantages. The DLnanovaccines were more efficient at driving HAI, CD8+ T-cell responses, and ultimately generating protection to animals from intranasal influenza challenge. DNA vaccine approach can effectively synergize with structure-guided protein engineering to quickly produce in vivo designer nanovaccine constructs for rapid evaluation.",

            "text": "When DNA-launched nanovaccines were compared to recombinant protein nanovaccines, widely considered as an extremely potent vaccine formulation in terms of induction of antibody responses, [52] we observed DLnanovaccines induced comparable humoral responses to recombinant protein nanovaccines, but uniquely induced potent CD8+ T-cell responses in an MBL-complement-independent manner. The observation that DLnanovaccines function independently of MBL-complement pathway is likely of interest for clinical translation of such vaccines, as approximately 5-20% of human populations have MBL deficiency (plasma MBL < 100 ng mL -1 ). [53, 54] The role of T cells in immune surveillance to mediate protection provides a strong rationale for exploring this unique property of DLnanovaccine, [55] especially for such diseases as liver-stage malaria, [56] influenza for the elderlies, [57, 58] and cancer. [59] The unique ability for DLnano vaccination to induce CD8+ T-cell responses may be related to its distinct mechanism of antigen uptake and presentation. Antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, are known to migrate into the site of EPto scavenge antigens expressed through DNA cassettes associated with apoptotic cells. [49] Prior studies observed that co-delivery of DNA vaccines with proapoptotic-mutated Caspase 2 or Fas significantly increased both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to the vaccine antigens. [60, 61] Such distinct mechanism of antigen processing might lead to more efficient cross-presentation to the MHC class I pathway. Additionally, APCs including DCs and macrophages may also be directly transfected with the inoculated DNA cassettes in vivo, [62, 63] and the two mechanisms may be synergistic in the induction of CD8+ T-cell immunity. Our findings also demonstrated that DLnanovaccine could improve induced CD8+ T-cell responses by eightfold to tenfold relative to their monomeric counterparts. Given that DNAvaccines can already induce CD8+ T-cell responses in patients to cause histopathological regression of HPV-driven cervical dysplasia, [4] the finding is relevant and whether DLnanovaccines can further improve the clinical response rates should be explored.",

Fewer immunizations of DLnanovaccine could induce the same, if not higher, titers of antibodies. Given recent advances in the EP technology has improved the potency and consistency of immune responses induced by DNA vaccines in patients, [4, [37] [38] [39] 63, 65] it will be important to determine whether DLnanovaccines can also help to reduce doses used in the clinic and lower the number of clinical visits required for vaccination.

Immunogens were then tilted by random rotations around the x and y axes up to 30\u00b0 for the first three-fourth of the simulation and up to 75\u00b0 for the last one-fourth of the simulation, with a 120\u00b0 rotation allowed for the z axis. The immunogens were also translated by 10-200 \u00c5 along an axis projected away from the nanoparticle surface. Clashes were detected at each iterations and the models with the lowest number of clashes at each translation were written out as a potential structural model. The models were manually inspected and utilized to construct linkers as glycine-serine repeats using 30 \u00c5 per 9 linker residues as a guide.
