Under inflammatory conditions, either due to autoimmune responses or infection, the inflamed blood\u2010brain barrier (BBB) endothelium upregulates the expression of adhesion molecules (selectins and cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily). Several surface molecules expressed by CD4 T cells, such as P\u2010selectin glycoprotein ligand\u20101, \u03b1L\u03b22, \u03b14\u03b21, CD6, or \u03b16\u03b21, regulate sequential steps for transmigration that include tethering, rolling, capture, firm adhesion, and finally diapedesis of blood\u2010borne circulating T cells across the endothelial layer 4. Antigen recognition in the subarachnoidal spaces then allow T cells to migrate through the glia limitans superficialis into the CNS parenchyma, leading to clinical disease 5. In this scenario, a pivotal role for the interaction between the \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin heterodimer expressed by activated T helper 1 CD4 cells, and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM\u20101), its main ligand on BBB endothelial cells, has been demonstrated 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. However, as Th17 CD4 cells were shown to infiltrate the brain in the absence of \u03b14\u2010integrin in an \u03b1L\u03b22\u2010dependent manner 10, 11, \u03b14\u2010independent routes to the CNS exist for other crucial T\u2010cell subsets.",

Interaction between P\u2010selectin glycoprotein ligand\u20101 and P\u2010selectin contributes to the recruitment of human CD8 T cells in brain vessels 15.

The conflicting results about neutralization of \u03b14\u2010integrin in EAE and in coronavirus\u2010induced encephalitis, restricting or not CD8 T\u2010cell infiltration of the CNS, suggest that these cells may use alternative and possibly unidentified adhesion molecules to gain access to the CNS, raising the potential for selective control of their trafficking into the brain 10, 17, 18.",

While HA\u2010specific CD8 T cells untreated or treated with a control IgG bind to recombinant ICAM\u20101 and VCAM\u20101, an anti\u2010\u03b14\u2010integrin mAb completely inhibited binding to VCAM\u20101 (one\u2010way ANOVA, p < 0.00001), but did not affect binding to ICAM\u20101 (Fig. 1B).

Therefore, we treated CamK\u2010HA recipients with an anti\u2010\u03b14\u2010integrin or a control IgG at day 0, 4, and 8 after the adoptive transfer of 5 \u00d7 106 cytotoxic HA\u2010specific CD8 T cells. Compared to recipients receiving the control IgG, CamK\u2010HA recipients treated by anti\u2010\u03b14\u2010integrin mAb lost less weight (one\u2010way ANOVA, p < 0.0001) and showed no death (0/10 versus 5/10, Log\u2010rank test, p = 0.006). In addition, survivors experienced less diabetes insipidus (2/10 versus 4/5) (Fig. 1C\u2013E). Since \u03b14\u2010integrin is a subunit shared by both \u03b14\u03b21\u2010 and \u03b14\u03b27\u2010integrin heterodimers, we then investigated which one is involved in CD8 T\u2010cell migration into the CNS. Currently no mAb is available that specifically recognizes the \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin heterodimer, while the DATK32 mAb recognizes and blocks specifically the \u03b14\u03b27\u2010integrin heterodimer 7. We therefore treated CamK\u2010HA recipients with this anti\u2010\u03b14\u03b27\u2010integrin mAb. Recipients underwent the same clinical phenotype as mice receiving the control mAb. Indirectly, this strongly suggests that the \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin is the essential heterodimer for activated CD8 T\u2010cell migration into the CNS in our model. However, \u03b14\u2010integrin blockade did not fully abrogate the neurological signs induced by HA\u2010specific CD8 T\u2010cell transfer in CamK\u2010HA mice as significant weight loss developed when compared to control littermates (Fig. 1C), and central diabetes insipidus was detected in 20% of treated recipients.",

Eight days after the adoptive transfer of 5 \u00d7 106 cytotoxic HA\u2010specific CD8 T cells, CamK\u2010HA recipients treated with an anti\u2010\u03b14\u2010integrin mAb or a control IgG were sacrificed and their CNS\u2010infiltrating cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. A drastic reduction in the number of CD45high Thy1.2+ T cells infiltrating the CNS was observed in recipients treated with the anti\u2010\u03b14\u2010integrin mAb (1333 \u00b1 263 versus 35 452 \u00b1 5748 cells/CNS, respectively, Mann\u2013Whitney test, p < 0.0001; Fig. 2A\u2013B). Ex vivo analysis of splenocytes showed that the anti\u2010\u03b14\u2010integrin mAb did not deplete CD8 T cells in the periphery, and even promoted the accumulation of transferred cells in the secondary lymphoid organs (Supporting Information Fig. 2A\u2013B). Moreover, ex vivo analyses and restimulation with the cognate HA peptide showed that the anti\u2010\u03b14\u2010integrin mAb also did not affect activation of transferred CD8 T cells collected from spleen and lymph nodes (Supporting Information Fig. 2C\u2013F). In the CNS, we observed a decrease in microglial activation, evaluated by MHC class II expression on CD45int CD11b+ cells, in recipients treated by the anti\u2010\u03b14\u2010integrin mAb (MFI for MHC class II 589 \u00b1 127 versus 6825 \u00b1 1172, Mann\u2013Whitney test, p = 0.0002; Fig. 2C\u2013D).

Antagonization of \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin, therefore inhibits CD8 T\u2010cell infiltration and microglial activation in the CNS parenchyma of recipient CamK\u2010HA mice.",

Indeed, CNS microvascular endothelial cells express JAM\u2010B in addition to PECAM\u20101 (Fig. 4). We investigated whether JAM\u2010B could be potential ligand for \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin expressed on CD8 T cells. We treated CamK\u2010HA recipients with an anti\u2010JAM\u2010B mAb at day 0, 4, and 8 after the adoptive transfer of 5 \u00d7 106 cytotoxic HA\u2010specific CD8 T cells. While CamK\u2010HA recipients treated by the anti\u2010JAM\u2010B mAb displayed significantly less weight loss compared to recipients treated by control IgG or anti\u2010VCAM\u20101 mAbs, they displayed the same incidence of diabetes insipidus and death (Fig. 3A\u2013C). Flow cytometry analysis of the CNS of CamK\u2010HA recipients treated by anti\u2010JAM\u2010B mAb showed a significant decrease in the number of infiltrating CD45.1+ CD8 transferred cells compared to mice receiving the control IgG (7016 \u00b1 2029 versus 14 331 \u00b1 1582 cells/CNS, Mann\u2013Whitney test, p = 0.017; Fig. 3E). This decrease was similar to that achieved when blocking VCAM\u20101 (Mann\u2013Whitney test, ns), but clearly inferior to the inhibition achieved by the anti\u2010\u03b14\u2010integrin mAb (Mann\u2013Whitney test, p = 0.0017; Fig. 3E). Increased dose of anti\u2010JAM\u2010B mAb did not improve the reduction of CNS\u2010infiltrating CD45.1+ CD8+ transferred cells, suggesting that saturating concentrations of the antibody were obtained (Supporting Information Fig. 3). Therefore, JAM\u2010B expressed by BBB endothelial cells might represent a ligand for \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin\u2010mediated migration of CD8 T cells into the CNS. In order to test the hypothesis that VCAM\u20101 and JAM\u2010B are complementary ligands for \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin, we treated recipients with both anti\u2010JAM\u2010B and anti\u2010VCAM\u20101 mAbs. Coadministration of both mAbs did not demonstrate a synergistic reduction in the number of CNS\u2010infiltrated CD45.1+ CD8 transferred T cells (Fig. 3E). We finally investigated the phenotype of CD8 T cells that entered the CNS of CamK\u2010HA recipients after blockade of \u03b14\u2010integrin, \u03b14\u03b27\u2010integrin, VCAM\u20101, or JAM\u2010B.

However, because the \u03b14\u2010integrin is common to \u03b14\u03b21\u2010 and \u03b14\u03b27\u2010integrin heterodimers 22, it is unknown which one is implicated. Our model showed that blockade of \u03b14\u2010integrin, but not of the \u03b14\u03b27\u2010integrin heterodimer, prevents encephalomyelitis and tissue damage by interfering with cytotoxic CD8 T\u2010cell entry into the CNS. These results strongly suggest that the \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin is the essential heterodimer for the interaction of activated CD8 T cells with the BBB. Similarly, blocking \u03b14\u2010integrin can abrogate the development of EAE mediated by encephalitogenic CD4 Th1 cells 7, 8, 9, 10. Those cells critically rely on \u03b21\u2010integrin to accumulate in the CNS during EAE 6. Moreover, blocking the \u03b14\u03b27\u2010integrin heterodimer fails to inhibit EAE development in mice and Rhesus monkeys 7, 23, and ectopic expression of the \u03b14\u03b27\u2010integrin ligand MAdCAM\u20101 in CNS endothelial cells fails to trigger CNS recruitment of \u03b14\u03b27\u2010expressing T cells 24. Thus, \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin rather than \u03b14\u03b27\u2010integrin mediates both CD4 and CD8 T\u2010cell interaction with CNS endothelium. However, as \u03b14\u2010integrin blockade did not totally abrogate clinical signs and CNS infiltration of transferred CD8 T cells in our model, an \u03b14\u03b21\u2010independent route, although accessory, remains operative. Its molecular bases are still to be determined.",

VCAM\u20101 is constitutively expressed at low level on the BBB endothelium, and mediates both the initial capture and the subsequent G\u2010protein\u2010dependent arrest of CD4 Th1 cells upon interaction with the \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin 8. Expression of VCAM\u20101 is upregulated in inflammatory conditions on endothelial cells of the BBB and of the blood\u2010leptomeningeal barrier, as well as on choroid plexus epithelium of the blood\u2010cerebrospinal fluid barrier, further increasing \u03b14\u03b21/VCAM\u20101\u2010mediated T\u2010cell adhesion to inflamed CNS endothelium 25, 26. It was previously shown that VCAM\u20101 blockade inhibits clinical or histopathological signs of EAE mediated by encephalitogenic CD4 Th1 cells 7. In a model of OVA\u2010expressing Listeria monocytogenes infection, access of OVA\u2010specific CD8 T cells to the CNS was inhibited by the antibody\u2010mediated blockade of VCAM\u20101 to the same extent as did the \u03b14\u2010integrin blockade 18. Unexpectedly, blockade of VCAM\u20101 in our model only had a partial effect on CD8 T\u2010cell migration to the CNS, as the number of CNS\u2010infiltrated CD8 T cells was reduced by 46% compared to mice treated by the control IgG (Fig. 3D). This decrease was not clinically relevant as recipients treated with different clones of anti\u2010VCAM\u20101 mAb experienced weight loss, death, and diabetes insipidus to the same extent as mice treated by the control IgG. Therefore, VCAM\u20101 blockade was not sufficient in our model to inhibit \u03b14\u03b21\u2010expressing CD8 T\u2010cells migration into the CNS. Several differences between our study and that of Young et al. 18 might explain those discordant results, including the genetic background of the mice, BALB/c or (BALB/c \u00d7 C57BL6) F1 versus C57BL6/J, the localization of the HA and OVA antigens in different cells, neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, and the state of differentiation of the encephalitogenic CD8 T cells (terminally differentiated highly cytotoxic versus shortly activated CD8 T cells). Moreover, the L. monocytogenes infection within the CNS in this model might induce additional triggers including increased expression of VCAM\u20101 at the BBB, allowing for increased VCAM\u20101\u2010dependence of CD8 T\u2010cell migration into the CNS. It was suggested that natalizumab, a humanized mAb against the human \u03b14 subunit of \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin and \u03b14\u03b27, might also affect CD4 and CD8 T\u2010cell expression of \u03b14\u2010integrin\u2010unrelated molecules such as CD62L, CXCR3, and \u03b1L\u03b22 in long\u2010term treated natalizumab patients 27, 28. Here, we have used a very short treatment. In addition, the high specificity of PS/2 for the murine \u03b14\u2010integrin subunit makes this antibody unlikely to cross\u2010react with other integrin subunit or unrelated molecules such as selectins. Indeed, PS/2 recognizes the functional epitope B2 on the \u03b14\u2010integrin subunit and was shown to specifically block \u03b14\u03b21\u2010mediated lymphocyte binding to VCAM\u20101 and fibronectin as well as \u03b14\u03b27\u2010dependent binding to VCAM\u20101 and MAdCAM\u20101 in vitro 29, 30. Another explanation could be that, in our model, VCAM\u20101 is not the sole, or even not the main, ligand for \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin.",

At least two additional vascular ligands have been described, the CS1 domain of a spliced variant of fibronectin 31, 32, and JAM\u2010B 21, 33. Since no reliable blocking antibody against CS1 domain is currently available, the role of fibronectin in the migration process of CD8 T cells could not be explored yet. Because \u03b14\u03b21\u2013JAM\u2010B interaction has only been investigated in vitro or in vivo in skin microvasculature 21, and because JAM\u2010B is expressed by the BBB in our model, we focused on this putative ligand for CD8 T\u2010cell migration to the CNS. Members of the classical JAM family are transmembrane type 1 proteins with two immunoglobulin domains highly expressed in cells that present well organized tight junctions, such as the endothelium of the BBB 34. JAM\u2010A, interacting with \u03b1L\u03b22\u2010integrin, is implicated in cell migration to the CNS. A blocking mAb directed to JAM\u2010A significantly inhibited leukocyte infiltration in the CSF and the brain parenchyma in a model of cytokine\u2010induced meningitis 35. However, those results were not confirmed in infectious meningitis 36. JAM\u2010B plays a central role in the regulation of paracellular permeability 34, but also impacts T\u2010cell rolling and firm adhesion 21. Although a lack of JAM\u2010B expression at steady state on brain endothelial cells was suggested 37, we show that JAM\u2010B is expressed on brain endothelial cells in our murine model of CNS autoimmunity. Because blockade of JAM\u2010B was associated to a partial protection against encephalomyelitis and a significant reduction in the number of infiltrated CD8 T cells, however to a lesser extent than \u03b14\u03b21\u2010integrin blockade, our data suggest that JAM\u2010B participates to the CD8 T\u2010cell migration process to the CNS.",

Unfortunately, natalizumab is associated with an increased risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic disease of the CNS caused by John Cunningham (JC) virus infection of oligodendrocytes 39]. Development of PML following natalizumab therapy likely relies on a multifactorial scenario including permissiveness for active JC virus replication and impaired immune surveillance 40, 41, 42, 43. Compared with untreated MS patients, natalizumab treatment induces a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid CD4 and CD8 T cells 44, 45. Because CD4 and CD8 T cells are crucial in controlling JC virus reactivation and dissemination 46, 47, our results suggest that development of PML is, at least in part, due to natalizumab\u2010mediated inhibition of CNS immunosurveillance by JC virus\u2010specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, natalizumab\u2010associated PML in MS patients is often complicated after natalizumab withdrawal by IRIS, darkening again the prognosis 48. Although CD4 T cells might participate 49, a clear dominance of CD8 T cells in CNS\u2010infiltrates has been observed in natalizumab\u2010associated PML\u2010IRIS occurring in patients with MS 50, reminiscent of the PML\u2010IRIS pathology described in HIV\u2010infected patients 51.
