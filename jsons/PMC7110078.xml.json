The analysis was restricted to patients who survived to 6 months after HCT and for whom PFT results were available both before (baseline PFT) and after that period. Clinical variables were collected prospectively as part of the usual clinical care and were stored in a centralized database. Disease risk for all malignancies at the time of HCT was classified as low, intermediate, or high, on the basis of previously published criteria [4]. Donor type was determined according to donor-recipients ABO compatibility and HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR status. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was graded using standard criteria [5] and was categorized as yes\u2013acute GVHD (grades 3\u20134) or no\u2013acute GVHD (grades 0\u20132). The diagnosis and staging of chronic GVHD were established using previously published criteria [6]. Acute and chronic classes of GVHD were then integrated and categorized as no\u2013acute GVHD or chronic GVHD, acute GVHD alone, de novo chronic GVHD (not preceded by acute GVHD), and chronic GVHD (preceded by acute GVHD that was or was not followed by a period of quiescence)",

All patients with radiographic signs of LRT infection underwent a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Nasopharyngeal-throat wash and swab samples, BAL specimens, and/or tissue-biopsy or autopsy material were tested for community respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133, influenzavirus A and B, adenovirus, and rhinovirus), by direct immunofluorescence (DFA) testing, shell vial centrifugation culture, and conventional culture. Cultures were inoculated into tissue cultures containing rhesus monkey kidney, human foreskin fibroblasts, and A549 cells. Type-specific respiratory DFA smears were performed using commercially available, type-specific antiserum (Bartels VRK; Intracel) [7]. BAL samples were also tested for CMV, by viral culture, shell vial centrifugation culture, and DFA. Probable or proven aspergillus pulmonary infection was confirmed by a positive culture or by histopathological results of BAL or lung biopsies [8]. Community respiratory-virus URT infection was defined as the detection of any community respiratory virus from a nasopharyngeal-throat specimen, by culture, shell vial culture, or DFA, in conjunction with consistent symptoms in the absence of a new infiltrate detected by chest radiography. Community respiratory-virus LRT infection was defined as the isolation of any respiratory virus, by culture or DFA from BAL or lung biopsy or autopsy specimens, in conjunction with symptoms and a radiographically new or changing infiltrate [7, 9]. On the basis of the viruses detected in the clinical specimen, 3 categories of community respiratory-virus infection were defined: parainfluenza infection, RSV infection, and \u201cother\u201d infection, which included rhinovirus, adenovirus, and influenzavirus A or B. Any patient with a parainfluenza infection, regardless of coinfections, was considered as having parainfluenza infection and was analyzed in the parainfluenza category only. The same criterion was applied to patients with RSV infections, unless parainfluenza virus was also detected, in which case patients were analyzed in the parainfluenza category",

Two-sided P values <.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Univariate analyses were conducted using the \u03c72 test. The presence of significant airflow decline by year 1 was analyzed in a multivariable logistic regression model. The outcome, significant airflow decline, was defined as a binary variable. The independent variable included the localization of the infection and the species of community respiratory virus. An additional analysis was performed to determine the risk of severe airflow decline associated with LRT CMV infection and pulmonary aspergillosis. The model was adjusted for age at HCT, baseline FEV1:FVC ratio, and GVHD category. These were covariates that had been found to be significant risk factors for airflow decline in the previous analysis [1]. The Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the median rate of decline in percentage of predicted FEV1, of each viral-infection category, from baseline to day 100 and from day 100 to year 1",

None of these patients were coinfected or developed a superinfection with a bacterial pathogen.

By day 100, the median rates of decline in percentage of predicted FEV1 for patients who had LRT infection with either parainfluenza virus or RSV were 13% and 11%, respectively. All patients with URT viral infection only experienced a rate of decline in percentage of predicted FEV1 that was <5% (figure 1). The median (range) percentage of predicted FEV1 for patients with versus patients without community respiratory-virus infection was 0.97 (range, 0.58\u20131.33) versus 0.96 (range, 0.53\u20131.34) at baseline, 0.88 (range, 0.48\u20131.28) versus 0.90 (range, 0.36\u20132.42) at day 100, and 0.90 (range, 0.49\u20131.32) versus 0.92 (range, 0.27\u20131.31) at year 1. Comparison of the median rate of decline in percentage of predicted FEV1 in the different groups of community respiratory-virus infections demonstrated that patients with LRT parainfluenza-virus infection experienced the most pronounced decline of airflow (figure 1). The difference was statistically significant when LRT parainfluenza-virus infection was compared with each of the community respiratory-tract virus infections (P<.03), except in the case of LRT RSV infection (P=.09). The rate of decline in percentage of predicted FEV1 for patients with LRT RSV infection did not reach statistical significance (when compared with that in the other groups). During the months after infection (day 100 to year 1), there was a slight improvement in the function, with the median rate of percentage of predicted FEV1 increasing from 1.6% to 5%, depending on the type of infection with which patients presented during the initial 100 days (figure 1). The median rate of improvement in percentage of predicted FEV1 was not statistically different between the different categories of infection (P=.74)",

In multivariable analysis, LRT viral infection was found to significantly increase the risk of development of airflow decline \u2a7d1 year after HCT, and this risk was particularly high for patients who developed an LRT parainfluenza-virus infection (table 3). LRT RSV infection probably also increases this risk; however, the number of cases was too small to reach statistical significance. Interestingly, even URT parainfluenza-virus infection was notably associated with airflow decline, suggesting a potential mechanism for the previously reported poor outcomes associated with URT parainfluenza-virus infection [7]. The presence of copathogens has been reported as being a significant risk factor for death in patients with parainfluenza pneumonia [17]. In the present study, none of the patients with LRT viral infection were infected with a copathogen, precluding us from assessing the impact that copathogens might have on airflow decline associated with respiratory-tract virus infection. The absence of copathogens in this study is probably due to the fact that only long-term survivors of respiratory-tract virus infections were included. We did, however, examine the impact that 2 common pulmonary pathogens had on airflow decline. As expected, neither LRT CMV infection nor LRT aspergillus infection increased the risk of severe airflow decline in patients who survived the infection",

The most significant decline of the percentage of predicted FEV1 was observed between the day of HCT and day 100, during which time the respiratory-tract virus infection occurred. The significant decline observed for LRT infections compared with URT infections has to be considered with caution, because of the limitation inherent in performing multiple testing. Although the percentage of predicted FEV1 of patients who experienced a significant FEV1 decline during the first 100 days after HCT improved between day 100 and year 1, none of those patients\u2019 levels of FEV1 returned to their baseline, suggesting that, despite some recovery, LRT infection with community respiratory viruses can result in permanent loss of lung function. There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. Prolonged shedding of parainfluenza is known to occur in immunosuppressed patients [18], and subclinical shedding of respiratory viruses has been documented in HCT recipients [19]. Thus, subclinical persistence of the virus in the respiratory tract after the initial infection might maintain sustained airway inflammation, which may ultimately lead to permanent loss of lung function, even after apparent clinical clearance of the infection. Community respiratory viruses might also activate an inflammatory process in the LRT that, in the patients who survive the acute phase of an LRT virus infection, might lead to irreversible damage to the tissue of the small airways that is independent of viral replication [20]",

Its strengths include the large sample size, a standardized diagnostic approach for URT and LRT infections, and standardized PFTs throughout the study period. One limitation is that the predictor of interest (community respiratory-virus infections) was assessed only during the first 100 days after HCT. It is likely that respiratory-tract virus infections can also occur later, after patients have been discharged from the transplantation center and return to a less protected environment. In addition, other potential contributors, such as bacterial coinfection, were not examined. Another possible limitation is that the conventional detection methods used in this study, because of their lack of sensitivity, may have underestimated the true rate of respiratory infections [21]. These assays were also unable to detect uncultivated pathogens, such as human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses [22\u201324]. However, both undetected pathogens and asymptomatic shedders [25, 26] would be included in the noninfected group and would therefore make the significance of our findings even stronger. A further possible limitation is that the number of cases was not large to provide adequate power to assess the individual role that viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, and influenza virus play in the occurrence of significant airflow decline. Finally, only patients who survived the infection were included in the estimation of the rate of airflow decline, resulting in a potential \u201chealthy survivor effect.\u201d However, this limitation might actually have resulted in an underestimation of the impact that respiratory infection had on the rate of lung decline",
