If misused, this record, together with datasets capturing your e-mail, web-browsing or buying habits collected by various companies could lead to significant intrusions into your privacy. However, these records represent a huge opportunity to science, offering access to patterns of human behaviour at a level and of detail previously unimaginable. Quantifying and understanding such patterns may help us to design better public transport and safer public spaces, or to control a disease outbreak. But how do we balance the inherent tension between the need for information and privacy? One way is to follow the framework developed by Colizza and colleagues1, ignoring the individuals and focusing instead on a coarse-grained description of the system, using block or cell variables.",

In industrial countries, with almost 100% mobile-phone penetration, such information is readily available to phone companies. Indeed, each phone communicates with the closest tower, leading to a natural partition of the country into distinct geographic cells (see Fig. 1). Given that calls are recorded for billing purposes, the movement of each mobile phone user can be reconstructed, as illustrated by the solid lines in Fig. 1. Yet, if we want to predict the spread of a contact-based viral infection, such as influenza or SARS, such detailed individual information is not required. Knowing the number of people moving from one region to the other would be sufficient (Fig. 1). Such real-time monitoring of the aggregated motion of individuals, rather than individual trajectories, may be acceptable for privacy advocates and would be sufficient to develop public monitoring and alert systems3. Yet this approach poses some fundamental scientific challenges: how do we formulate the complex diffusion and spreading problem using such a coarse-grained description?",

Diffusion to nearby regions takes place along the network links. The network can be a regular lattice if it aims, for example, to capture reactions between diffusive reactants. However, if the problem at hand described a virus spreading by airline traffic between cities, it would have a so-called scale-free architecture4 (as found in numerous real-world networks). For the mobile-phone-based system of Fig. 1, the network captures the traffic between regions determined by geographically neighbouring mobile-phone towers.",

If their spreading rate exceeds a critical threshold, however, an outbreak will occur, which could potentially reach a considerable fraction of the population. In 2001, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani5 established a now classic result: the epidemic threshold vanishes if the network on which the virus spreads is scale-free. Given the evidence that both sexual6,7 and e-mail networks8 may have scale-free characteristics, this means that even weakly virulent biological or e-mail viruses have the potential to spread \u2014 a prediction that has not only renewed interest in the interplay between the network structure and spreading processes, but has also initiated a vigorous debate on the subject.",

Attempting to answer this question, Colizza and colleagues hand us a puzzle: when each individual interacts with only a finite number of other individuals within a block (which is a realistic assumption), the threshold remains, even if the network is scale-free. So something is lost in the translation. Indeed, descriptions based on block variables predict that weakly spreading viruses will easily die out and that traditional epidemic control measures aimed at decreasing the spreading rate could succeed in stopping an epidemic. Interestingly, the limit where the threshold does vanish \u2014 when an individual interacts with every other individual within the block \u2014 is not realistic when direct-contact processes, such as e-mail or sexual interaction, are responsible for the spread.",

For example, there is a fine-scale network describing the interactions between individuals found within each cell, ultimately forcing us to address a multiscale problem, describing a network of networks. Money-tracking measurements indicate that individual travel patterns between blocks may be heavy tailed9. Similarly, all measured times between consecutive human-driven events, such as library visits or e-mails, seem to be described by heavy-tailed processes10,11, which challenges the traditional Poisson-process-based modelling framework11. Therefore, the model studied by Colizza et al.1 explores logical extreme cases rather than experiment-based local mixing patterns. Yet, simple models rooted in statistical physics, such as this, go a long way in sharpening our understanding of the key features, difficulties and paradoxes involved in modelling human-driven processes.",
