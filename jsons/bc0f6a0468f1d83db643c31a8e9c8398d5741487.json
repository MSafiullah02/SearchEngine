Of 1688 health-care workers who have become infected with COVID-19, five (0\u00b73%) have died; 5 a sign of the vastly difficult working conditions for health-care workers.",

Considering the above factors, clinicians might not use non-invasive ventilation for critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 until further data from the COVID-19 epidemic are available. ",
