Cattle progress through different stages of production and may experience exposure to novel pathogens, transportation and relocation stress, different management, and commingling with other animals.1, 2 Although there are many potential infectious disease challenges that beef cattle may encounter, bovine respiratory disease (BRD) remains the most prevalent and costly disease affecting cattle production in North America, and the impact is greatest in the stocker and feedlot sectors of the beef industry.3 Stress-induced immune dysfunction, viral infection, and bronchopneumonia caused by bacteria are interwoven within the complicated etiology of BRD. Therefore, vaccination against viral and bacterial agents involved in BRD is a vital instrument in the \u201canimal health tool box\u201d for cow-calf, stocker, and feedlot operators.",

            "text": "Some important considerations regarding vaccination of beef cattle at the cow-calf, preconditioning, stocker, and feedlot phases of beef production include the following:\u2022Cow-calf phase: at birth, branding, and weaning, beef calves could experience acute (short-term) rather than chronic (long-term) stress, which may result in priming of the immune system and contribute to an enhanced vaccine response in calves.4 In general, the timing of vaccination during the cow-calf phase is most favorable because it allows sufficient time for vaccinates to develop immunologic protection before natural challenge with BRD-causative agents during and after transition to a stocker or feedlot facility.\u2022Preconditioning phase: calves that are vaccinated and retained on their ranch of origin after weaning for other preparatory management exhibit less morbidity and health costs at the feedlot and generate greater net return to the cow-calf producer because calf value is increased.5, 6, 7, 8 Despite clear health improvements for preconditioned cattle, the industry-wide adoption of this management practice is low, as only 39% of all beef operations vaccinated calves against respiratory disease before sale.9\n\u2022Stocker phase: most beef calves placed in stocker programs are lightweight, immunologically na\u00efve, and stressed. Veterinary practitioners and stocker producers should consider vaccine safety and the potential for inadvertent antigenic enhancement of modified-live virus (MLV) vaccines administered to newly received stocker calves. Because subsequent disease challenge in the feedlot phase is probable, stocker calves should be administered vaccines with adequate time for immunization to occur before feedlot shipment. However, stocker producers should consider delaying MLV vaccination for 14 to 30 days after arrival, as improved health and performance outcomes have been reported in high-risk stocker calves using this strategy.10, 11\n\u2022Feedlot phase: the adoption rate of respiratory vaccination in the feedlot is nearly 100% due to tradition, practical design, and labor structure of feedlot facilities, and the relatively low cost of vaccines.12 However, further research is needed to understand the efficiency of vaccination against the numerous disease-causing agents that exist in the feedlot. As suggested for the stocker phase, delayed MLV vaccination may improve health outcomes in auction-derived feedlot cattle.13\n\n",

Only 68.9% of cow-calf operations vaccinated cattle for any disease in 2007,17 which is in sharp contrast to a 2016 survey of veterinary practitioners indicating that 93% of cow-calf operations in the United State have a vaccination plan in place for cattle.14 It is possible that recommendations and/or adoption of vaccination protocols changed over the 9-year lapse between surveys; however, it is more likely that a discrepancy between veterinarian recommendations of vaccination and implementation by beef cow-calf operations exists. This is further supported by a survey indicating that only 39% of all beef operations vaccinated calves against respiratory disease before sale,9 despite the overwhelming recommendation of veterinarians to vaccinate calves against BRD pathogens during the cow-calf production phase.",

Several previous reviews have examined respiratory vaccination outcomes in the production setting and convey a general lack of evidence for vaccine efficiency in high-risk, newly received beef cattle.22, 23, 24 Therefore, a need exists to critically examine current vaccination paradigms in the beef industry and consider the safety of vaccination under various conditions (eg, acute vs chronic stress, production phase, commingling), the types of vaccines selected (MLV vs killed virus), and timing of vaccine administration in relation to expected natural pathogen challenge.",

Nevertheless, a different humoral response to killed versus MLV respiratory antigens in immunosuppressed cattle may exist. An inhibited antibody response against killed Salmonella dublin vaccination was observed when calves were concurrently administered cortisol.32 An opposing antibody response was noted when replicating MLV vaccine antigens (bovine herpesvirus-1 [BHV-1] and BVDV) were administered concurrent with increased stress-induced cortisol concentrations; the antibody response to these viruses was enhanced in stress-challenged cattle.32 These findings are likely due to increased cortisol causing immunosuppression that allowed increased antigenicity of MLV vaccine antigens and a subsequently enhanced antibody titer response. Cattle treated with an \u201cacute,\u201d \u201cchronic,\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d stress model, induced by dexamethasone treatment and vaccinated with a multivalent combination respiratory vaccine-bacterin, generated different antibody titer responses depending on the antigen-specific antibody evaluated.33 The leukotoxin-specific antibody response from a M haemolytica toxoid was least in the chronic dexamethasone-challenged steers, intermediate for acute, and greatest for control steers.33 Conversely, both the BHV-1- and BVDV-specific antibody response from the MLV fraction of the combination vaccine was greatest for chronic dexamethasone-challenged steers, intermediate for acute, and least for control steers.33 The greater antibody titer for dexamethasone-treated cattle administered MLV is probably a result of much greater replication of the live-attenuated vaccine agents in the immunosuppressed host. Therefore, MLV vaccination in high-risk cattle that are immunosuppressed may not be safe, which is a primary rationale for delayed vaccination recommendations.",

A large pen study13 with 5179 auction-derived heifers observed a decrease in the number of heifers treated twice for BRD and numerically less morbidity, mortality, and case fatality rate for those receiving their initial MLV at 30 days after feedlot arrival compared with on-arrival. However, other small studies suggest no difference in health or performance for either the on-arrival or delayed procedure35, 36, 37 or vaccine versus control38 in high-risk cattle. It is valuable to mention that in smaller studies it can be problematic to analyze proportional data means while avoiding a statistical type II error; therefore, when interpreting these small pen studies, the practitioner should consider evidence of biological relevance that may exist in the absence of statistical significance. In another study comparing MLV respiratory vaccination or control (no MLV vaccine) during the stocker receiving period, the vaccinated calves had significantly greater odds of BRD morbidity and mortality.11 Ultimately, difficulty arises when assessing the current literature with regard to the benefits, or lack thereof, of vaccinating cattle immediately on feedlot arrival, due to the variation of cattle conditions (eg, immune status, marketing channels used, age, breed) and the complex nature of BRD. Therefore, it is also important to consider the biological implications of vaccine components, such as endotoxins, on the immune system.",

Unlike endotoxins, exotoxins are heat-liable, highly antigenic proteins that are also considered highly toxic. However, similar to endotoxins, exotoxins may be released when bacterial cells are lysed. In 1959, Sambhu Nath De42 discovered the first exotoxin by isolating the toxin that causes cholera. This seminal work led to subsequent research on immunologic responses to toxins and the development of vaccines, or toxoids containing attenuated toxin, and antitoxins.43 Exotoxins are often used for vaccine development via chemical or heat inactivation of the exotoxin to create a toxoid. Although the resulting toxoid antigen maintains immunogenicity, the biological properties associated with exotoxin-related toxicity are disabled. The bacterial exotoxins can be classified threefold according to their mode of action: Type I are membrane-acting toxins that bind surface receptors and stimulate transmembrane signals; type II are membrane-damaging toxins that directly affect cell membranes by forming pores or disrupting the lipid bilayers of the cell membranes; type III toxins modify an intracellular target molecule by translocating an active enzymatic component into the cell.44\n",

The mechanisms by which proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 induce sickness behaviors such as anorexia and depression remain to be fully elucidated; however, it has been suggested that cytokines directly act on the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis region of the brain, perhaps via intermediate messengers such as prostaglandins.

Commonly used vaccines against gram-negative bacteria and the associated diseases in cattle production are indicated in Table 2\n. Use of bacterins began when a physician named William Coley began treating patients with both live- and heat-killed Serratia marcescens and streptococci to treat sarcomas. This practice, known as Coley toxins, was used for more than 30 years with much success, despite occasionally inducing severe adverse effects, such as extreme fever and toxic shock.58 Today, most gram-negative vaccines contain whole cell modified and/or killed bacteria, with relatively small amounts of free endotoxin, thus resulting in less risk for severe adverse effects after use. Endotoxins in each of these vaccines have different antigenicity based on the bacterium used to produce the vaccine and the structure of the endotoxin molecule present. For example, the LPS molecule can vary structurally between Escherichia coli vaccines depending on the strain used to develop the vaccine, and thus the antigenicity of the LPS present in a vaccine can vary. Although free endotoxin concentrations are generally low, mishandling of vaccines can increase free endotoxin released from the cell wall membrane due to killing or lysis of the bacteria, thereby increasing the antigenicity of the vaccine. Therefore, it is critical that vaccines are handled appropriately to reduce the risk of endotoxicity in vaccinated cattle. Factors that may constitute mishandling of gram-negative bacterins include the following:\u2022Improper temperature during storage or use leading to increased endotoxin concentration (for example, exposing bacterins to high heat or freezing temperatures can rupture bacterial cells, thus causing the release of endotoxin from the outer cell wall membrane)\u2022Excessive shaking of bacterins before use, resulting in lysis of the bacterial whole cells or fragments leading to the release of LPS and other endotoxins or exotoxins\u2022Exposure to UV light (direct sunlight) that may result in cellular degradation and release of free endotoxin\n",

Due to the potential for endotoxins in bacterins to produce a synergistic or additive response, endotoxin stacking can lead to toxicity that could be fatal.59 As previously mentioned, the mechanism by which endotoxins such as LPS create an immunologic response is via a cytokine cascade. This cascade is influenced by the amount of endotoxin present, whether the endotoxin is bound or free, and host factors that can make an animal more vulnerable to endotoxin. A report noted that endotoxin from multiple bacterial sources resulted in more drastic physiologic and immunologic responses than that of the same endotoxin concentration from a single source. Estimating the frequency with which endotoxin stacking occurs in beef production and the impact on cattle health and performance is difficult, as cattle vaccination protocols differ depending on the producer, veterinarian, and geographic location. However, 2 or more gram-negative vaccines are often administered simultaneously in production settings, and often these bacterins or toxoids are administered concurrent with MLV vaccines and other biological or pharmaceutical products (ie, antimicrobials, anthelmintics) and negative interactions could occur in some cattle, but the interaction of the various animal health products used in cattle is poorly understood.",

Sick cattle or cattle exposed to stressful conditions for an extended period should not be vaccinated with endotoxin-containing vaccines, as these cattle may have an altered immune system and be more susceptible to the negative effects of endotoxin. Endotoxins are well known for their pyrogenic properties; therefore, endotoxin vaccination during times of heat stress also should be avoided, as this could potentially increase the overall heat load in the animal. It is again noteworthy to mention that vaccine labels stipulate use in healthy animals. In addition, the hydration and nutritional status of the animal may influence the effectiveness of a vaccine. Generating an adequate immune response to a vaccine requires a significant amount of energy and nutrients and undernourished and/or dehydrated cattle may not be physiologically capable of mounting an appropriate response to the vaccine. The conundrum of these scenarios is that most producers and veterinarians vaccinate juxtaposed to other processes, such as weaning, branding, or arrival at a new location. To further complicate vaccination protocols and cattle-processing procedures, with respect to endotoxin overloading, producers often administer metaphylactic antimicrobials at processing in conjunction with vaccination. Many antimicrobials target gram-negative pathogens, resulting in endotoxin release after the targeted action of the antimicrobial results in killing or lysis of bacteria. Different antimicrobial classes, and different antimicrobials within classification, vary with respect to their impact on cell wall morphology and the subsequent amount of endotoxin released.60\n",

Exposure to structurally altered or lesser amounts of endotoxin may initiate a small immunologic response that could enhance the effectiveness of bacterins and result in immunologic memory against gram-negative bacteria. In fact, the low concentrations of endotoxins in a bacterin may indeed exert beneficial actions similar to the proposed immune-priming effects of acute stress and some commercial MLV vaccines contain very small quantities of endotoxin for this very reason. Furthermore, low concentrations of LPS will lead to a mild to moderate febrile response that can aid in controlling bacterial proliferation in the host.40 Endotoxin exposure also stimulates B-cell differentiation and enhances phagocytic activity, thus helping the host animal immune system to recognize and eliminate invading pathogens more rapidly and effectively. For example, genetically altered mice that do not respond to LPS have been reported to be more susceptible to bacterial infections.61 Therefore, exposure to small quantities of LPS typically aids immune function and may be beneficial in eliminating pathogens by increasing effector capacities of macrophages and other leukocytes.",

Interestingly, it has been reported that gram-negative bacterial endotoxins are responsible for almost half of septic cases in humans.64 In addition to the potential for inducing lethal septic shock, endotoxin exposure stimulates the release of the proinflammatory cytokines as previously discussed. Increased cytokine production leads to vasodilation that can inadvertently increase bacterial translocation and dissemination throughout the body65 and may lead to increased proliferation of virulent strains of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli.66 Compounding this problem is the inhibited bacterial clearance invoked by endotoxicity and the impaired function of immune cells, such as monocytes.67 Thus, although the release of proinflammatory cytokines is essential for maintaining homeostasis within the animal, there exists a \u201ccatch-22\u201d scenario in that the permissive effects of these cytokines on bacterial proliferation leads to a perpetuating cycle of increased cytokine production and subsequent increased risk of sepsis.",

However, vaccine efficiency may not be realized if the timing of vaccination is inappropriate, vaccinates are immunosuppressed, and/or if the infectious challenge is greater than the immunologic protection afforded by vaccination. Vaccine recommendations in cattle often rely on anecdotal evidence and tradition, rather than scientific evidence, because there is a dearth of randomized, controlled field studies that evaluate vaccine efficiency, and some vaccination practices disregard vaccine label instructions. Veterinary practitioners should consider emerging research on the efficiency of on-arrival versus delayed vaccination in newly received stocker and feedlot cattle monitored under field conditions. Furthermore, endotoxicity risk is increased when 2 or more gram-negative bacterins are administered concurrently; therefore, veterinarians and producers should avoid endotoxin stacking when designing cattle vaccination protocols.",
