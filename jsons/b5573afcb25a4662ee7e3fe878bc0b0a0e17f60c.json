The American Society of Echocardiography recently developed guidelines for safely performing echocardiography on patients suspected of having or are positive for COVID-19. 2 The guidelines speak on \"who to image,\" \"where to image,\" and \"how to image,\" with the goal of protecting the physician performing the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or transthoracic echocardiogram and the sonographer assisting during these cases.",

During perioperative cardiac cases, with patients already intubated and connected to the ventilator; multiple manipulations of the TEE probe lead to contamination of oral secretions from the probe to the TEE and anesthesia machines as well as other areas where a perioperative physician is providing care. Birnbach et al. demonstrated how rapidly an anesthesia provider's hands could contaminate any surface that he or she touches after endotracheal intubation. 3 To minimize this contamination, I propose the following novel method to safeguard healthcare providers and perform TEE safely. You would need an ultrasound (US) probe cover, bite block, and clear plastic equipment cover.",

Open the US probe cover and insert the TEE probe with the bite block where the US probe typically is inserted. Make sure the tip is positioned in the middle of the US sleeve so that there is no redundant probe cover (Fig 1, B and C). 4. Make a hole at the tip of the sleeve so that only the TEE probe can come out (Fig 1, D) . 5. Cover the whole probe, including the control knobs, with the probe cover and secure with plastic or paper tape around the controls (Fig 2, A and B ). 6. Insert the TEE probe without the plastic sleeve in the patient's esophagus. 7. Remove the soiled outer gloves and insert the bite block, which is inside the US probe cover in between the patient's teeth (Fig 2, C) . 8. Remove the second pair of gloves and sanitize hands.",

Since the TEE probe is being manipulated inside the US sleeve, there is no contamination of the US machine or other anesthesia workstations. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to perform frequent hand hygiene and appropriate use of personal protective equipment as per the nature of exposure. I hope this technique will be helpful not only to many perioperative physicians involved in echocardiography but also to physicians performing TEE elsewhere in the hospital.",
