This approach involves discussions about a particular case; participating doctors are taught how to deal with situations in which they must reach decisions about public health. The disease-oriented system (DOS) has formed the basis of traditional educational systems, adhering to traditional medical teaching methods. Although the DOS seems to be an effective and reasonable method for obtaining results; it is neither perfect nor optimal in terms of practicality. The problem-based learning (PBL) method was developed to overcome these limitations in the DOS method. Medical treatment is incomplete when the individual is considered in isolation. Indeed, we must consider various ambient and interactive environmental factors in order to adequately understand the etiology of, and recovery from, a disease. In other words, although we emphasize treating the patients and not the diseases, we do not provide our medical students with the practical training required to achieve this goal. Figure 1 visually represents the case-method concept, illustrating a more systematic and holistic approach to medicine, in which the scope of learningwhich proceeds through discussion -is wider than that of DOS or PBL. Through such quasi experience-based studies, medical students can not only acquire knowledge and develop the desired professional attitudes and behaviors but can also come to learn about the psychological and social problems actually experienced by patients. Thus, in a way that mimics medical practice, they will be trained to solve problems embedded in actual situations. In addition, the shift from passive to active learning should enhance other abilities, such as communication skills and the practice of continually updating knowledge about state-of-the-art medical technologies. The case-method approach also offers the advantage of using actual cases to learn about the multidimensional issues involved in various aspects of medical practice, such as drawing on knowledge as the basis of actions, understanding the backgrounds of patients, and maintaining awareness of personal motivations and ethical concerns. However, the case method also has its share of problems. Table 1 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the case-method approach.

It has long been acknowledged that patients and physicians tend to have different and sometimes conflicting views on health problems and on reasonable expectations for managing such problems. The perception of being understood by a physician provides emotional support for patients, especially at a time of great stress and vulnerability. Communication is a major component of medical encounters and a fundamental means for the physician and patient to share perspectives. A growing body of evidence has linked effective communication not only to patient satisfaction and treatment adherence but also to health outcomes, including symptom resolution, functional status, physiological measures, and pain control.

Identification and classification of verbal events are coded directly from videotapes or audiotapes, not from transcripts. Coding software to help coders work directly from the audio/video data is also available. Elimination of the resource-intensive effort necessary for an accurate and full transcription represents a practical advantage offered by the RIAS. In addition, because coding proceeds directly from video or audiotapes, it is possible to assess the tonal qualities of the interaction.

Table 3 shows the results of an analysis of patient-physician communication occurring during cancer consultations in Japan. The details of this study have been previously published [7] [8] [9] . This analysis using the RIAS shows that a major part of the interactions involved information giving by both physician and patient. On the other hand, striking differences between physicians and patients emerged with respect to several categories. Physicians asked nearly twice the number of questions, whereas patients produced twice as many positive utterances. The consultation was largely focused on biomedical topics, and the proportion of psychosocial exchanges was minimal. The regression analyses of patient satisfaction with respect to physician and patient communication behaviors, controlling for the identity of the physician and the characteristics of the patient and consultation [7] [8] [9] , showed that a greater proportion of open-ended questions and a lower proportion of direction were associated with higher patient satisfaction. These communication styles have often been recommended to physicians for use in patient-centered consultations. On the other hand, the perceived emotional responsiveness of physicians was negatively associated with patient satisfaction. In this study, most of the utterances classified as physician emotional responsiveness were statements intended to reassure and encourage patients, such as \"there is no need to worry\" or \"you will be all right.\" These data suggest that reassurance and encouragement might differ in essential ways from empathy and acceptance. That is, encouraging statements, especially when offered early in the presentation of patient complaints, may function as interruptions, preventing patients from fully describing their concerns. It is also possible that patients felt that they were expected to respond to reassurance from physicians by concluding their remarks even if they still had something to say. Among the patient communication behaviors, question asking was associated with lower levels of satisfaction, possibly because the information needs of patients increase when the information provided by physicians is not sufficient or comprehensible. This may lead to greater question asking and lower satisfaction with the consultation.
