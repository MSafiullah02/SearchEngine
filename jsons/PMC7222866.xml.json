Furthermore, the impact of TTR values over time on outcomes has not yet been prospectively investigated in this patient population. This is of particular importance, as TTR levels may change over time, depending on the inflammatory response to the trauma and subsequent interventions, as well as the adequacy of nutrition during the hospital course. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to prospectively investigate the association of TTR levels at ICU admission and over time on clinical outcomes in critically ill trauma patients. We hypothesized that higher TTR levels are associated with better clinical outcomes.",

On the other hand, decreasing TTR levels over time may indicate both, an ongoing inflammatory state, e.g., due to multiple surgical procedures or complications, and inadequate nutritional support.

The different results of the current study and the study by Parent et al. may be explained by the different inclusion criteria. In the study by Parent et al., patients who required less than 2 days of mechanical ventilation and less than 7 days of ICU care, as well as patients who were expected to die during the first 2 days after admission, were excluded. Consequently, the ICU and total hospital LOS were much longer in the study by Parent et al. than in the current study (14 vs. 4 and 26 vs. 10, respectively). Thus, more time to correct the initial low TTR levels during the hospital course was available in the study by Parent et al., whereas part of the patients with low initial TTR levels included in the current study were discharged early or died during the hospital course.",

Although TTR levels are affected not only by nutrition, but also by the inflammatory state [27], persistently low TTR levels, especially in the absence of ongoing surgical procedures, may indicate an insufficient nutritional supply and therefore increased infectious complications.

TTR measurements were more frequently ordered in male patients and patients with penetrating injuries, more severe trauma, and a longer hospital LOS.",

As the proportion of patients admitted to the ICU with TTR measurements was relatively small and baseline characteristics of the patients included in the study and all other trauma patients admitted to the ICU during the study period were different, the results may not be valid for critically ill trauma patients in general. The current analysis of TTR levels at ICU admission and over time therefore has to be interpreted with care. Nevertheless, the current study presents the first prospective evaluation of TTR levels at ICU admission and over time as a marker for clinical outcomes in critically ill trauma patients.",

Based on these results, TTR may be considered as a prognostic marker in this patient population. Further research is warranted to confirm the results of this study in larger cohorts of critically ill trauma patients.",
