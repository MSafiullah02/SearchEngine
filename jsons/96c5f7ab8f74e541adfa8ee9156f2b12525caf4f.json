Human blastomycosis was first reported by Gilchrist in 1894 in a case of cutaneous disease first mistakenly attributed to protozoan disease (Gilchrist 1894) . Four years later, Gilchrist and Stokes isolated the causative agent, a fungus they called Blastomyces dermatitidis (Gilchrist and Stokes 1898) . The first case of canine blastomycosis was reported by Meyer in 1912 (Meyer 1912 . Since then, blastomycosis has been recognized as a common and serious disease of people and animals in endemic/enzootic areas.",

Outbreaks have involved both rural and urban exposures (Smith and Gauthier 2015) . Recreational outdoor activities and especially water activities as well as exposure to excavation and construction are frequently implicated in human and canine blastomycosis (Baumgardner et al. 1995; Smith and Gauthier 2015) . Proximity to waterways has been identified as a risk factor for sporadic blastomycosis in people (Baumgardner et al. 1992 ) and in dogs (Archer et al. 1987; Baumgardner et al. 1995; Arceneaux et al. 1998) . For instance, case-control studies of canine blastomycosis in Louisiana and Wisconsin have identified residence within 400 m of a body of water to be a significant risk factor for the disease in dogs (Baumgardner et al. 1995; Arceneaux et al. 1998 ). In Louisiana, Arceneaux et al. found the odds of living near water was tenfold higher for dogs with blastomycosis than controls (Arceneaux et al. 1998 ).",

Persons with immunodeficiencies who develop blastomycosis are reported to have more severe forms of the disease (Pappas et al. 1993 ), but the numbers of cases reported to date have been small. Persons treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 inhibitors may represent a growing cohort at risk of blastomycosis (Smith and Kauffman 2009) . Individuals with diabetes mellitus appear to be at higher risk of blastomycosis (Lemos et al. 2002) and of requiring management in an intensive care unit (Kralt et al. 2009 ). Most animals with blastomycosis were previously healthy, although Davies and Troy reported 10% of infected cats in a small series had feline leukemia virus (Davies and Troy 1996) . Anderson et al. (2016) recently showed that people can become reinfected with Blastomyces spp.; previously, whether a second episode of blastomycosis represented reinfection and not relapse was inconclusive. These authors reported on two persons in whom blastomycosis was diagnosed and treated, only to later develop the disease again (Anderson et al. 2016) . By genotyping isolates from the initial and subsequent episodes in each respective patient using 27 polymorphic microsatellite markers, they demonstrated that relapse occurred in one case (concordance between the two isolates at 27/27 loci) and reinfection occurred in the other (concordance at just 15/27 loci) (Anderson et al. 2016) .",

Most affected dogs are immunocompetent (Sykes and Merkel 2014) . The incidence appears to be highest in young, large sporting dogs and hounds, including coonhounds, pointers, Weimaraners (Rudmann et al. 1992) , golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, and Doberman pinschers (Arceneaux et al. 1998) . Sporting dogs may be more likely to be exposed due to selective use in hunting (Rudmann et al. 1992 ).

The concurrent or sequential infection of a person and his or her dog is common (Baumgardner et al. 1992) and likely due to a common exposure (Sarosi et al. 1979; Armstrong et al. 1987; Baumgardner et al. 1992) . Even so, dogs appear to develop disease earlier (Sarosi et al. 1979) . In experimental murine blastomycosis, larger inocula lead to earlier disease (Williams and Moser 1987) , and it has been inferred that the shorter prepatent period in dogs reflects increased inocula from being closer to the ground (Legendre 2012) . In any case, a history of blastomycosis in one's dog should raise suspicion for the disease in a person with a compatible syndrome (Sarosi et al. 1979 ).",

            "text": "Clinical signs encountered in persons with blastomycosis will depend on the organ systems involved, but clinicians should be aware of the protean nature of the disease (Bradsher 2014a) . Pulmonary infection can be subclinical or can result in an acute or chronic pneumonia (Sarosi et al. 1974) . Acute pulmonary blastomycosis can present with fevers, sepsis, and hypoxia, with clinical examination and radiographs consistent with focal airspace disease (Sarosi et al. 1974; Lemos et al. 2002) . In other words, the disease can be indistinguishable from community-acquired (bacterial) pneumonia (Lemos et al. 2002; Bradsher 2014a; Alpern et al. 2016) , and it is common for patients to receive multiple courses of antibiotics before the correct diagnosis is established (Alpern et al. 2016) . Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in 8-15% of cases of symptomatic blastomycosis (Meyer et al. 1993; Vasquez et al. 1998; Lemos et al. 2001; Azar et al. 2015) and is associated with mortality rates of at least 40% (Meyer et al. 1993; Vasquez et al. 1998; Lemos et al. 2001; Azar et al. 2015; Schwartz et al. 2016) . Patients with chronic pulmonary involvement may present with chronic dyspnea, cough and hemoptysis, often accompanied by constitutional symptoms. The radiographic appearance is like acute disease but with a third of patients having mass-like lesions (Patel et al. 1999) . Not surprisingly, chronic blastomycosis is frequently mistaken for pulmonary malignancies or tuberculosis (Lemos et al. 2002; Bradsher 2014a) . Extrapulmonary disease occurs in~25-40% of cases (Baumgardner et al. 1992; Lemos et al. 2002) . The most common extrapulmonary site of blastomycosis is the skin, usually manifesting as ulcerative or verrucous lesions (Bradsher 2014b) . Osteoarticular disease is the next most common form (Kralt et al. 2009 ). In a series of persons with osteoarticular blastomycosis, disease of the axial skeleton was most common, followed by long bones of the lower limb (Oppenheimer et al. 2007 ). Vertebral disease may rarely present with spinal cord compression syndromes (Saccente et al. 1998) . As with bacterial osteomyelitis, disease of long bones most often localizes to the metaphyses (Oppenheimer et al. 2007 ). Arthritis is less common than osteomyelitis. It is generally monoarticular and mimics pyogenic bacterial septic arthritis (Oppenheimer et al. 2007 ). In males, the third most common site of extrapulmonary blastomycosis is the prostate and genitourinary system (Saccente and Woods 2010). Central nervous system disease is less common, occurring in approximately 5% of cases with extrapulmonary dissemination (Bariola et al. 2010) . Patients may present with meningitis, encephalitis, or signs of a spaceoccupying lesion (Bush et al. 2013) . Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis occurs and can have either lymphocytic or neutrophilic predominance (Bariola et al. 2010) . Ocular involvement has been reported but it is uncommon (Lopez et al. 1994 ).",

Chest radiographs may show focal airspace disease or a \"snowstorm\" pattern of reticulonodular disease (Crews et al. 2008b) (Fig. 8.1 ). Ocular disease is much more common in dogs than in humans, occurring in up to half of all cases (Bloom et al. 1996; Arceneaux et al. 1998 ). Among these, bilateral disease occurs in half (Bloom et al. 1996) . Ocular disease can be localized to anterior segments, posterior segments, or, most commonly, both (i.e., endophthalmitis) (Bloom et al. 1996) . Like in human disease, cutaneous involvement is common in canine blastomycosis, occurring in approximately half of infected dogs (Arceneaux et al. 1998 ). An example of a dog with bilateral ocular and cutaneous disease is shown in Fig. 8 .2. Other common sites of extrapulmonary disease include lymphatic and osteoarticular structures (Arceneaux et al. 1998 ). Central nervous system disease is less common, occurring in 6% of dogs in a series (Arceneaux et al. 1998) . Cardiovascular blastomycosis has been reported in nine dogs (Langlois et al. 2013; Schmiedt et al. 2015) ; it is extraordinarily uncommon in people.",

Blastomyces dermatitidis/gilchristii grow on general fungal media such as Sabouraud's dextrose agar or potato dextrose agar, incubated at 25-30 C (Bradsher 2014b) . Growth of white to buff colonies usually appears within 10-14 days but may require up to 6 weeks incubation (Bradsher 2014b) . Microscopically, B. dermatitidis/gilchristii characteristically have conidiophores of varying lengths that run perpendicular to hyphae and terminate with single conidia that resemble \"lollipops\" (Bradsher 2014b) . In contradistinction, the conidia of B. percursus appear in clusters at the end of conidiophores (Dukik et al. 2017) . Traditionally, conversion of the mold to a yeast phase at 37 C was performed for confirmation of the identification, but this is rarely done today (Saccente and Woods 2010) . Most microbiology laboratories confirm identification of B. dermatitidis/ gilchristii with a DNA probe (AccuProbe; GenProbe Inc., San Diego, CA), but cross-reactions can occur, including with other dimorphic fungi (Saccente and Woods 2010). The diagnostic yield of culture is surmised from a retrospective review of cases of human pulmonary blastomycosis (Martynowicz and Prakash 2002) . Blastomyces dermatitidis was isolated from the first sputum sample in 75% of cases, which increased to 81% after a mean of 2.3 samples (Martynowicz and Prakash 2002) ; the diagnostic yield of bronchial washings was even higher. Nonetheless, the true sensitivities are likely lower since only diagnosed cases (i.e., those with at least one positive test) are included in this type of study.",

Moderately severe to severe pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease should be treated preferably with lipid formulation amphotericin B (3-5 mg/kg) or alternatively amphotericin deoxycholate (0.7-1.0 mg/kg) until clinical improvement, followed by de-escalation to a triazole for 6-12 months (Chapman et al. 2008 ). Central nervous system disease should be treated with a lipid formulation of amphotericin B (3-5 mg/kg) (for 4-6 weeks or until clinical improvement) followed by step-down to a triazole for 12 months (Chapman et al. 2008; Limper et al. 2011) . Recent interest in the use of voriconazole for CNS blastomycosis has been driven by improved CSF and brain tissue penetration (Ta et al. 2009 ); accumulating published clinical experience provides anecdotal support for its use for this indication (Bakleh et al. 2005; Borgia et al. 2006; Bariola et al. 2010; Bush et al. 2013) . Therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended for itraconazole and possibly voriconazole to ensure adequate levels are maintained (Chapman et al. 2008; Limper et al. 2011) . Acute respiratory distress syndrome due to blastomycosis occurs in 8-15% of persons with symptomatic blastomycosis (Meyer et al. 1993; Vasquez et al. 1998; Lemos et al. 2001; Azar et al. 2015) , but it portends a grave prognosis with case fatality rates of at least 40% (Meyer et al. 1993; Vasquez et al. 1998; Lemos et al. 2001; Azar et al. 2015; Schwartz et al. 2016) . Consequently, the roles of adjunctive, rescue therapies for ARDS caused by blastomycosis are an area of great interest, but little data. Some investigators have suggested a role for adjunctive corticosteroids considering the inflammatory cascade involved in the pathogenesis ARDS (Hough 2014) . Anecdotal support has come from case reports and series (Lahm et al. 2008; Plamondon et al. 2010; Azar et al. 2015; Schwartz et al. 2016) , although sufficiently powered prospective or retrospective studies are unlikely to be forthcoming (Schwartz et al. 2016) . Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is another promising adjunctive rescue therapy for ARDS due to blastomycosis (Dalton et al. 1999; Resch et al. 2009; Bednarczyk et al. 2015; Schwartz et al. 2016 ) and should be considered in centers where the capacity exists.",

In vitro susceptibility testing on a small number of human B. dermatitidis isolates suggests fluconazole has less activity than itraconazole (Li et al. 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005) . While no trial has compared these head-to-head, small single-arm trials in humans are informative. In a prospective, open-label trial of 48 persons with non-life-threatening, non-CNS blastomycosis, itraconazole (at a dose of 200-400 mg daily, for a mean of 6 months) resulted in 90% success (response with no relapse by 1 year follow-up) (Dismukes et al. 1992) . In contrast, a trial of fluconazole at a dose of 400-800 mg daily (for a mean of 8.9 months) in 39 patients with non-life-threatening, non-CNS blastomycosis resulted in successful outcome in 87% (Pappas et al. 1997) . Prospective trials are lacking in dogs, but Mazepa et al. (2011) retrospectively compared 36 and 31 dogs treated with fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. The study was not powered to detect a difference in outcomes, but dogs treated with fluconazole required longer courses of therapy than those treated with itraconazole (median 183 vs 138 days, respectively). Nonetheless, costs for fluconazole were much less than for itraconazole, with median costs of $1223 and $3717, respectively (Mazepa et al. 2011) . Taken together, this data suggests that fluconazole at higher doses and for longer courses may be reasonable alternatives to itraconazole for blastomycosis in animals.",

Foy and colleagues prospectively studied 27 dogs with blastomycosis who were monitored clinically, radiographically, and with detection and quantification of Blastomyces antigen in urine and serum following discontinuation of antifungal therapy; among these, 12 dogs were also monitored from time of therapy initiation (Foy et al. 2014 ). The investigators found that urine antigen levels dropped dramatically within several months of initiation of antifungal therapy. Seven of 27 dogs (26%) relapsed at a median of 4 months following treatment discontinuation. Five of these had detectable antigenuria at the time of clinical relapse, but only one had rising levels of antigenuria preceding clinically detectable relapse. Moreover, persistence of positive urinary antigen at treatment discontinuation did not predict relapse: only two of seven dogs that relapsed had detectable antigenuria at that treatment discontinuation. On the other hand, five of eight of dogs with antigenuria at the end of therapy did not relapse (Foy et al. 2014) . In summary, monitoring urine antigen levels during and/or after discontinuation of therapy is unlikely to add significant value to serial clinical and radiographic evaluations for most dogs with blastomycosis.",
