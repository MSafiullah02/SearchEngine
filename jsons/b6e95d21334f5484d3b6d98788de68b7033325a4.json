Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests were chosen for data analysis. We find that average temperature, minimum temperature, and air quality were significantly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study will help World Health Organization and health regulators such as Center for Disease Control (CDC) to combat COVID-19 in New York and the rest of the world.",

Our findings estimate that minimum temperature and average temperature are correlated with the spread of COVID-19 in New York city. Previous studies of Tan et al. (2005) and Vandini et al. (2013) support our findings. Shi et al. (2020) also researched climate indicators and stated that temperature serves as a driver for the COVID-19. As a cultural and financial capital of the world, New York city also oversees high mobility from local as well as constituents from other major places to seek employment and business opportunities. Humidity is another contributor for the spread of COVID-19 as it contributed in the rapid transmission within New York City and empirical estimations of this study will be useful in the outcome of efforts to suppress COVID-19. According to official census data, New York City is resident to 8.54 million people with population increasing at 4.6% per year and 26,403 residents living per square mile. The reason for such a dense population is the average life expectancy of New York residents, which is 80.9 years, this is 2.2 years longer than the national average of life expectancy in America. Such statistics make New York an ideal epicenter for the spread of infectious diseases (Zu et al., 2020) .",

COVID-19 outbreak from Wuhan showed a strong association between disease spread and weather conditions, with predictions that warm weather will play an important role in suppressing the virus. Other meteorological indicators such as wind speed, air quality, and humidity also affect the spread of infectious diseases. Furthermore, air temperature also contributes towards the transmission of the virus . Ma et al. (2020) suggested that humidity and temperature will play an important role in mortality rate from COVID-19 as climate indicators and temperature correlate with the spread of COVID-19 (Poole, 2020) .",

Also, significance of air quality implies that green environment policies should be promoted as it would reduce the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Current study is of exploratory nature and in order to conduct a comprehensive investigation, future research direction should examine daily carbon emission data as current lockdown measures have greatly reduced carbon emissions. Another research direction is to include regional and cross-country investigations for most affected countries to provide better insight for the fight against COVID-19.",
