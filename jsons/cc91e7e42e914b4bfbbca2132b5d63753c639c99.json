In this article, we define the diagnostic serial interval as the time between the diagnosis dates of the infector and infectee.

Table 1 summarizes recent findings on the clinical onset serial interval of COVID-19. In this article, we study the clinical onset serial interval of COVID-19 using a rich data set of infector-infectee pairs observed in South Korea between January 20th and April 7th, 2020. We also introduce and study the diagnostic serial interval, which we define as the time between the infector's diagnosis and the infectee's diagnosis. In the case of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, diagnosis is assumed to be laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
