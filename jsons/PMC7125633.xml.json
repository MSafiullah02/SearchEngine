While evidence suggests that influenza infection is associated with a variety of respiratory [3] and circulatory conditions [4], laboratory diagnosis of influenza is uncommon, and complications resulting from influenza infection are unlikely to be attributed to influenza. Despite a lack of coded cases, a rise in mortality is observed within the influenza season, particularly in years with high influenza incidence [1], [2]. Estimation of the \u201cexcess\u201d disease burden due to influenza can be statistically complex, but is important for assessing the potential benefits and cost-effectiveness of vaccination programs.",

One of the simplest methods involves calculating the excess disease burden which occurs during periods of influenza activity over that occurring in baseline periods (i.e. periods when influenza is not circulating) [3], [9], [10]. However, results derived from this method may be inaccurate if other seasonally variable causes of disease are not considered. More complex statistical techniques are required to account for other seasonal variables and to assess the proportion of the excess disease burden that is attributable only to influenza. Two commonly used methods are Serfling-type models [11], [12], [13], [14] and Poisson regression models [15], [16], [17]. While there is debate around strengths and weakness of the various statistical approaches [18], [19], [20], [21], these two approaches can produce similar estimates when applied to the same time-period and population [19].",

In Australia RSV activity has been known to overlap with influenza activity (Fig. 1\n).

As in previous models estimating influenza disease burden [15], [16], [17] RSV activity was included as a covariate in the model. By including RSV activity in the model, the deaths (or hospitalisations) attributable to RSV are accounted for, and should not be confounded with deaths from influenza.",

We used a generalised linear model (GLM) procedure, assuming Poisson-distributed errors with the response variable (hospitalisations or deaths) assumed to be linear and additive in the covariates [20]. We tested for over-dispersion of errors, and when this was observed (in all models except those for mortality 50\u201364 years), the models were run again with negative-binomial error distributions. A negative-binomial model allows for the variance to be greater than the mean, and is therefore more appropriate in cases of over-dispersion. In the final models (for hospitalisation and mortality), the values of Pearson chi-squared and deviance divided by the degrees of freedom were not significantly larger than one suggesting a good fit to the data.",

However, they could also be the result of methodological differences in the models used, for example, Thompson et al. utilised weekly virological data, whereas this study utilised monthly data [15]. While weekly data may provide a more powerful method of estimating influenza-attributable disease, it also increases issues associated with time delays between influenza activity and influenza mortality.

No significant association between influenza activity and circulatory hospitalisations was found in either age-group.

Unfortunately, denominator data for all tests of respiratory viruses is not available in Australia at present. Secondly, due to small numbers of laboratory reports, all-age influenza activity was used, rather than age-specific laboratory reports. Other causes of respiratory infection (such as rhinovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus or parainfluenza virus) may also peak annually, and by disregarding these agents, the influenza-related disease burden could be overestimated.
