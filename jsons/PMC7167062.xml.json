Since oligopoly firms produce similar outputs and compete with their industry rivals, any action an oligopoly firm takes is noticed by its competitors. Consequently, rivals may react with price\u2010cutting or other attempts to enhance market share. Thus, the firms in an oligopoly are interdependent, and each recognizes that its market power is vulnerable to erosion by competitors or new market entrants.",

For example, in 2004, Northwest Airlines, Delta, and Continental agreed to permit booking on each other's flights.

Blair and Harrison (1999) and Moorman (2000) conclude that antitrust provisions need to be modified and strictly enforced to protect new entrants from unfair competition and anticompetitive acquisitions. Such antitrust activities include prohibiting price undercutting by established carriers or blocking proposed mergers. Kim and Singal (1993) found that mergers between two major carriers serving a single market result in a significant increase in market power and generate higher fares for consumers. However, Brueckner, Dyer, and Spiller (1992) found that markets served by more than the two merging carriers generally did not experience a significant increase in fares.",

When industry sales decline, airlines compete for a shrinking passenger base, and those with the lowest cost structures will be the most likely survivors.

Unprecedented terrorist acts involving commercial aircraft, the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and a global economic downturn had measurable adverse effects on airline load factors (e.g., percentage of seats occupied). The SARS epidemic particularly impacted airlines with a strong presence in Pacific routes (Carey, Stringer, and Trottman 2003). The devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, impacted consumers with added travel time for extensive security checks. Dramatic declines in passenger traffic following each national terrorism alert reveal the continuing impact of terrorism (Bedard, Mazzetti, and Barnes 2003). Rising variable costs for fuel, coupled with high and inflexible fixed costs, further reduce the airlines\u2019 ability to compete on the basis of price (Air Transport Association 2002; U.S. Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2003).",

Even before the devastating terrorist attacks, the airline industry experienced effects of the economic slowdown that began in early 2000; the industry continued to languish, despite receiving $5 billion in government grants following the terrorist attacks (Becker 2001). The recession and slow economic growth reduced the business travel base, on which airlines depend for their most lucrative sales of high\u2010priced seats. Rising unemployment levels increased consumer hesitancy to purchase leisure travel. Consumer discretionary travel was further affected by decreased household asset values, due to substantial stock market declines. The wealth effect that fueled the extended expansion of airline travel during the 1990s operated in reverse as consumer assets diminished. Newman (2003) notes that the market for air travel is changing in unanticipated ways that indicate continuing slow growth in passenger travel even without a new terrorist incident. Sharkey (2003) projects that domestic passenger travel is unlikely to reach the 2000 level of almost 700 million until 2008.",

With the notable exception of Southwest Airlines, low\u2010price carriers were unknown in many U.S. markets. Most other low\u2010fare airlines have been relatively short lived, often becoming victim to aggressive competition from major carriers (Bailey 2002; Blair and Harrison 1999). Prior to 2000, Southwest encompassed 75% of the total passengers flying low\u2010price airlines (Bailey 2002). While Southwest impacted the markets it served by considerably reducing competitive fare prices (known as the \u201cSouthwest Effect\u201d), it generally avoided direct competition with major airlines (Bailey 2002; Das and Reisel 1997; Morrison 2001) and focused on medium\u2010sized markets in the Pacific west and southwest.",

This is shown by a decline in price from P1 (at E1) to P2 (at E2). Such changes in demand would motivate an oligopoly industry to reduce supply, and the airlines have responded by decreasing the supply of passenger seats to reduce costs and maintain prices (from P2 to P3 at E3).\n5\n Further, technological changes in society and within the airline industry have reduced the industry's ability to increase prices in the present milieu.",

An added consequence of hub domination is the ability to engage in predatory pricing to ward off market entrants, especially new low\u2010fare carriers. Another problem at hub airports is that large carriers often control long\u2010term gate leases, making it difficult for new entrants to gain access to gates at an airport dominated by a single carrier (Bailey 2002).",

Profit margins for new entrants will become more attractive as the cost gap widens between low\u2010cost carriers and larger established airlines. New entrants will fill niche markets, serving particular regions of the country or providing point\u2010to\u2010point service to selected markets. Because low\u2010fare carriers serve as an effective curb against noncompetitive oligopolistic airline pricing, antitrust measures may be required to allow vulnerable start\u2010ups to compete with existing oligopolists.",

Features of three alternative industry structures related to each of the market scenarios are listed, with anticipated economic behavior deriving from competitive characteristics and the resulting effects on consumers. The first column presents the current oligopoly market structure, and the second and third columns present potential future alternatives. One future paradigm (column 2) envisions a strongly oligopolistic industry, but with substantial competition from low\u2010fare regional airlines, and the other (column 3) presents a comparable oligopoly without the moderating impact of robust low\u2010fare carriers. Mann (2001) expresses concern that continued consolidation of market power into a \u201cBig Three\u201d or \u201cBig Four\u201d scenario may lead to declines in service and higher prices. We conclude that it is unlikely the airline industry will maintain its current state. Thus, as illustrated in Table 1, consumers will be impacted by major changes in the airline industry.",
