The clinical algorithm proposed by Favre and colleagues has provided us with a clear and understandable way of guiding our clinical practice. Recently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided recommendations for breastfeeding in special circumstances, specifically for COVID-19. The CDC suggests washing hands before touching the baby; wearing a face mask, if possible, while feeding at the breast; washing hands before touching the pump or bottle parts; and cleaning all parts after each use.2 We think women should be permitted to breastfeed, if possible, unless future evidence suggests otherwise. Also, we believe the recommendation to use betamethasone for fetal lung maturation should be updated since many Latin American countries only have the option of using dexamethasone, which has been shown to be as effective as betamethasone.3\n",
