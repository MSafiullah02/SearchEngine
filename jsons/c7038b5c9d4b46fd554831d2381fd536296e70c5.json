One aspect of these pathways is the infl ammatory response, a response that may be generated in reaction to traumatic injury, acute pancreatitis, or severe infectious diseases. Many of the physiologic parameters that are traditionally measured in critically ill patients represent responses induced by the infl ammatory mediators, which are discussed below. Therefore, understanding the nature of the infl ammatory response aids our understanding of the physiologic response. A clear example of this is the altered body temperature, typically fever, which occurs in the setting of severe infections. The body's temperature is regulated by specifi c aspects of the infl ammatory response [1] [2] [3] . Thus, the infection induces an infl ammatory response that initiates the fever.",

There are several reasons for focusing on the cytokine pathways. First, the body actively upregulates and downregulates cytokine production in response to numerous stimuli. Many of the stimuli have physiologic importance. Second, cytokines have been selected for therapeutic intervention in critical illnesses [4] . There was a belief that appropriate modulation of the cytokines would improve outcomes. Finally, the cytokines, and their naturally occurring inhibitors, are easily measured, which allows for correlation between cytokine levels and clinical outcome.",

The CXC chemokines have a total of four cysteine residues, indicated by the C, which are separated by an intervening amino acid, which is designated by the X. The fi rst of these mediators to be well described was IL-8. The chief biologic properties of IL-8 include the recruitment and activation of neutrophils [15] . Interleukin-8 has been shown to recruit neutrophils to the site of an infl ammatory response by generating a chemotactic gradient. The CXC chemokines also activate neutrophils to increase the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and proteases. The CC chemokines act principally on mononuclear cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes. Clues to the specifi city of these molecules may be found in the very names that were assigned to them, such as monocyte chemotactic peptide. The chemokines are a very large family of proinfl ammatory molecules. As such they have undergone a name change, and each of the individual chemokines are now assigned a unique number [16] . The number is based on whether the chemokine belongs to the CC or the CXC family. The chemokine receptors have also been carefully numbered to include a CC or CXC designation. As an example, IL-8 has been renamed CXCL8.",

When the cytokines become increased at either the local or the systemic level, their biologic activity has the potential to alter infl ammatory reactions as well as physiologic responses. At suffi ciently high concentrations, cell, tissue, and organ injury may occur. Because these activities are so powerful, the body has developed regulatory mechanisms in order to appropriately modulate the biologic activities of these potent proteins. There are three broad classes of naturally occurring molecules that inhibit the biologic activity of pre-formed cytokines. The fi rst of these representative molecules, and the fi rst discovered, are soluble receptors that have been cleaved by proteolysis, and another group is the soluble binding proteins that are not receptors.

In many respects, soluble receptors act like specifi c antibodies, as they couple with, and neutralize, a very discrete range of mediators.

Higher levels of TNF that were not matched by increases in the soluble receptors predicted a poor outcome. Such reports changed the perspective among cytokine biologists to view biologic activity as not dictated by a simple measurement of the concentration but rather as a ratio between the proinfl ammatory cytokines and the cytokine inhibitors. If cytokines became elevated, but an associated increase in the cytokine inhibitors also occurred, the net biologic effect would be the same.

The highest ratios were observed in mice that were about to die. The ratio of cytokines to cytokine inhibitors was carefully followed in an experimental animal study to document the progression of disease [61] . The model used was the well-described cecal litigation and puncture (CLP) model [62] , which has been previously demonstrated to closely mimic many of the physiologic and pathologic changes observed in patients with sepsis [63, 64] . In the recent paper, liver levels of cytokines and cytokine inhibitors were documented over the fi rst 24 hours. The data show that, in a lethal model of sepsis, there is early production of proinfl ammatory cytokines followed by later production of antiinfl ammatory cytokines. Modulating the response by prior treatment with IL-1 RA resulted in increased bacterial load and greater mortality.",

The shedding of the soluble receptors of TNF has been demonstrated to control the threshold for activation of the innate immune response during infectious diseases [65] . In this study, a form of the TNF receptor was mutated so that it could not be shed. Mice with this mutant TNF receptor had increased resistance to intracellular infections but augmented autoimmune infl ammatory type processes. In a similar manner, mice that lack the TNF soluble receptor were resistant to the toxic effects of TNF but more sensitive to bacterial infections [66] . Treatment of septic patients with TNF soluble receptors resulted in increasing concentrations of TNF in the plasma but did not alter the antiinfl ammatory response [67] .

The infl ammatory response is multifactorial and complex. A simple, linear A B C probably does not fully refl ect the multifaceted events that typically take place during the acute infl ammatory response. A paradigm has arisen whereby it is believed that critically ill patients move through different phases. Shortly after the initiating event there is an acute phase of increased infl ammation that is typically termed the systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [68] . At the conclusion of this phase an antiinfl ammatory response arises, and the patients actually become immunosuppressed. This phase is typically termed the compensatory antiinfl ammatory response syndrome (CARS). This concept is usually graphed on a straight line [69, 70] , with the x-axis representing time and the y axis the level of infl ammation. This oversimplifi es a complex process. Many patients, and indeed even experimental animals, do not move in a straight line toward resolution of the infl ammatory response or organ injury and death. Despite these caveats, the concept of different states of infl ammation yielding different outcomes is attractive and worthy of pursuit.",

In contrast, normal individuals have substantial plasma levels of cytokine inhibitors, such as the TNF soluble receptors and the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein. In fact, it is diffi cult to calculate a ratio between the proinfl ammatory and antiinfl ammatory cytokines because the proinfl ammatory cytokines are equal to zero. The situation changes dramatically within a few hours of stimulation. For these experiments, the blood is stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. The proinfl ammatory cytokines are quickly induced and achieve high plasma levels within 6 hours. Notably, the antiinfl ammatory molecules do not become induced during this early time frame.
