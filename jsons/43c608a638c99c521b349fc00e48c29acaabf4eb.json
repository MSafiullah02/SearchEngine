Infection of IBDV leads to expression of five mature virus-encoded proteins. Proteolytic processing of the virus-encoded polyprotein generates VP3 which coats the inner surface of the IBDV capsid. In this report, we describe the characterization of the RNAbinding activity of VP3. For these studies, the VP3 coding region was fused to a histidine tag and expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus. The histidine-tagged VP3 was affinity-purified and used to study its ability to bind RNA molecules using three complementary methods: (i) Northwestern blotting; (ii) binding of VP3 protein-RNA complexes to nitrocellulose membranes; and (iii) electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The results demonstrated that VP3 efficiently bound ssRNA and dsRNA. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, the formation ofVP3-RNA complexes did not depend upon the presence of specific RNA sequences. A series of histidine-tagged VP3 deletion mutants spanning the whole VP3 coding region were generated. The use of these mutants revealed that the VP3 RNA-binding domain layed in a highly conserved 69 aa stretch close to the N-terminus of the protein. 724 G. Kochan et al.",

The capsid, with icosaedral symmetry, consists of 780 subunits clustered as 260 outer trimers arranged with a triangulation number T = 13 [6, 9] . IBDV contains a dsRNA genome formed by two segments, segment A, (3.2 kb), and segment B (2.9 kb) [13, 24, 32] . Segment A contains two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF 1 and ORF 2). ORF 1 encodes the nonstructural protein VP5 (17 kDa), important for virus egress [29, 46] . ORF 2 encodes a 110 kDa polyprotein that is autoproteolitically processed into VPX (48 kDa), VP4 (28 kDa) and VP3 (32 kDa). VPX is further processed to render VP2 (41 kDa) [10, 11, 40] . VPX, VP2 and VP3 are the major structural proteins [9], while VP4 is the viral protease responsible for polyprotein processing [4] .",

According to previous experimental data, VP3 might interact with the virus genome [22, 23] . Cryoelectron microscopy images of IBDV virus-like particles (VLPs), generated by polyprotein expression using a recombinant vaccinia virus, strongly suggested the presence of packaged nucleic acid (J.

Both products were recombined by PCR using primers A and B. PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the pFastBac-VP3-His plasmid restricted with the same enzymes. In this way, a series of VP3 mutants containing small deletions (\u2248 75 bp) spanning the whole coding region of the protein was generated ( Table 1 ). The carboxy-terminal deletion mutants VP3 1008-1012 (numbers represent positions of aminoacids in the polyprotein, flanking the deletions) and VP3 971-1012 presenting deletions of 5 and 42 residues, respectively, were obtained by cloning the VP3 fragment resulting from digestion with XbaI and NotI from plasmids pcDNA3-VP3 1008-1012 and pcDNA3-VP3 971-1012 (Maraver et al., submitted), respectively, into the pFastBact-HTc vector.

This virus expressed a N-terminal histidine-tagged version of VP3 under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. The ability of VP3 to bind ssRNA was initially tested by Northwestern blotting using total cell extracts from either WT baculovirus or VP3-Bac-infected cells. The assays were carried out using 32 P-labeled ssRNA probe B. This probe (Fig. 1) , VP3 was expressed at high levels in cells infected with VP3-Bac. A significant binding with ssRNA probe B was observed by the expressed VP3 in VP3-Bac infected cell extracts (Fig. 1) . A weak but significant band of bound probe was observed also in WT-infected cells, at the same position as IBDV VP3. This band accounted for a 5% of total bound RNA probe when compared to the cell lysate containing VP3, as determined by densitometric analysis. Western blot analysis with a VP3specific MAb confirmed that the RNA-binding protein expressed after infection with VP3-Bac was in fact VP3 protein (Fig. 1) . The RNA-binding protein present in cells infected with WT baculovirus did not react with VP3-specific antibodies, suggesting that this protein was either cellular or viral, but not VP3. These results also showed that monomers of VP3 fixed to nitrocellulose filters bound the ssRNA probe B.",

Purified VP3 was used for these studies instead of total cellular extracts due to the existence of an RNA-binding protein in control cell extracts that might interfere with the results (Fig. 1) . A series of shifted bands of RNA-protein complexes were visualized after incubation of purified VP3 with radioactive probe B (Fig. 2) . The intensity of these bands was directly dependent upon the amount of VP3 used in the binding reaction mixtures ( Fig. 2A) , reaching a plateau above a VP3 concentration of 6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 mM. Results were reproducibly observed in all experiments. No shifted bands were observed when relatively high amounts of BSA were used in the binding mixtures, as expected (Fig. 2) . These results further showed that baculovirus-expressed VP3 bound ssRNA probe B. Since pure VP3 was used for the studies, these results also showed that VP3 did not require the presence of other virus or cellular proteins to bind ssRNA.",

In constrast, VP3 alone or in the presence of a non-specific IgG formed at least three ribonucleoprotein complexes of different electrophoretic mobilities (Fig. 2B ).

Interestingly, except for the VP3 971-1012 deletion mutant, the samples contained two VP3 electrophoretic forms, resulting in doublets in SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 6B) . Bands corresponding to higher molecular mass species migrated according to their expected molecular masses. Estimation of the molecular masses of the lower protein bands indicated a consistent reduction of about 1.5 kDa compared to the expected size (Fig. 6B) . Northwestern analyses showed that both wild-type-derived VP3 forms interacted with labeled ssRNA probes (data not shown). The affinity of each mutant protein to ssRNA was determined by membrane filter binding assays, using probe B, as described above. The amounts of the purified deletion mutant proteins used in these assays were normalized according to their respective molecular masses. Identical molar amounts of each mutant protein were used in the assays. The ssRNA-binding activity of WT VP3 was estimated to have an apparent Kd of (2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u22124 mM (n = 3, CV = 10%) (Figs. 3 and 7) . Deletion mutants VP3 756-780 and VP3 781-807 presented a slightly reduced affinity compared to that of WT VP3. Carboxy-terminal deletion mutants showed an affinity similar to that of the complete VP3 protein, indicating that the ssRNA-binding domain was not affected by these deletions (Fig. 7) . In contrast, mutants presenting deletions at the region between residues 808 and 879 showed significantly lower affinities to ssRNA, up to 100-fold reduction in the case of VP3 856-879 deletion mutant. These results indicated that the VP3 ssRNA-binding domain was located within a region comprising from residues 808 to 879 (Fig. 7B) .",

Strikingly, capsids of members of the Birnaviridae family are much simpler. They contain a single protein shell [6, 9] . This unique feature makes especially interesting the study of both the molecular architecture and the morphogenesis of birnaviruses. The inner surface of the IBDV particle is coated by 200Y-shaped VP3 trimers in close contact with the continuous shell formed by VP2 [6, 9] . Although the precise capsid location of the putative RdRp, VP1, has not been established yet, it has been shown that it directly interacts with VP3 [28, 43] . Therefore, VP3 appears to play a crucial structural role. It has been suggested that VP3 might interact with the dsRNA genome segments [9, 22, 23] . Indeed, its presence in ribonucleoprotein complexes isolated from disrupted IPNV virions [22] , makes it a good candidate for playing a role in genome packaging and/or stabilization. It was therefore interesting to analyze the ability of VP3 to interact with RNA. We decided to undertake this analysis using a histidine-tagged version of the protein produced in insect cells infected with rBVs. The protein obtained under these conditions was highly pure and soluble, thus enabling us to carry out a number of highly specific assays.",

Two possibilities could explain the presence of the multiple shifted bands observed: i) VP3 could contain more than one RNA-binding domain; and ii) VP3 could form oligomers that bind RNA. The most abundant complex corresponded to the faster migrating band, even when extremely low concentrations of VP3 were used in the assays. This observation suggested that most likely the faster migrating band was formed by VP3 monomers. Moreover, the binding of VP3 to ssRNA in Northwestern assays showed that VP3 monomers generated under denaturing conditions bound ssRNA. The ability of VP3 to form oligomers has been assessed using a two-hybrid system approach [43] , and the structural analyses of IBDV particles and VLPs have revealed that VP3 molecules form trimers in the internal surface of the capsid [9] . Therefore, it is likely that VP3 might also form trimers under the conditions used for RNA-binding studies, explaining the presence of lower mobility shift bands when VP3 concentration was increased. However, the ability of recombinant VP3 to form trimers has not been tested in this work.",
