To increase awareness of and interest in public health and epidemiology, DAPHT has offered an elective rotation to fourth-year medical and veterinary students since 1975. The elective program is administered from July through June of the following year, and a student's rotation ranges from 6 to 8 weeks. In 1999, American Journal of Preventive Medicine (AJPM) published a description of the elective's progress\u2014from its inception in 1975 through June 1997\u2014including demographics of participants, the types of assignments, and the number who returned to CDC for the 2-year Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) postdoctoral program in applied epidemiology.1 We have since compiled data from July 1997 through June 2002 to update AJPM's readers on the progress of the epidemiology elective.",

With a grant from The Pfizer Foundation and Pfizer Inc. through the CDC Foundation, DAPHT is developing a 10\u201312 month fellowship in applied epidemiology for eight competitively selected medical students, beginning in Fall 2004 (i.e., The CDC Experience at www.thecdcfoundation.org/thecdcexperience). The program offers students a combination of didactic training and interactive seminars, participation in applied epidemiology projects (including Epi-Aids and other field investigations), and opportunities to present their work. The students will benefit from direct mentoring by their specific assignment supervisors and the many opportunities to network with public health professionals working in a variety of areas. Although the fellowship assignments will be based primarily in noninfectious disease programs at CDC, the students will be assured a wide range of experiences and opportunities in all fields.",
