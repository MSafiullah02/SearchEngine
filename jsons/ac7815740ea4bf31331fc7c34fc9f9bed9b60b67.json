The envelope 23 glycoproteins of HCV are heavily glycosylated with a high proportion of high-mannose glycans 24 (HMGs), which serve as a shield against neutralizing antibodies and assist in the interaction with 25 cell-entry receptors. However, currently there is no approved therapeutic targeting this 26 potentially druggable biomarker. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the lectibody 27 Avaren-Fc (AvFc), a HMG-binding lectin-Fc fusion protein. In vitro assays showed AvFc's 28 capacity to neutralize cell culture-derived HCV in a genotype independent manner with IC 50 29 values in the low nanomolar range. A histidine buffer-based AvFc formulation was developed 30 for in vivo studies using the PXB human liver chimeric mouse model. Systemic administration 31",

Gross necropsy and liver pathology further 34 confirmed the lack of discernible toxicity. This treatment regimen successfully prevented 35 genotype 1a HCV infection in all animals, while an AvFc mutant lacking HMG binding activity 36 failed to block the infection. These results suggest that targeting envelope HMGs is a promising 37 therapeutic approach against HCV infection. In particular, AvFc may provide a safe and 38 efficacious means to prevent recurrent infection upon liver transplantation in HCV-related end-39 stage liver disease patients.",

HCV is highly heterogenous and globally distributed, consisting of seven genotypes 45 each further subdivided into multiple subtypes. Genotype 1 is the predominant genotype 46 worldwide and particularly concentrated in high-income and upper-middle income countries, 47 whereas genotype 3 and 4 are more common in lower-middle and low-income countries (2).

            "text": "There is no vaccine currently available for HCV. Prior to 2011, the standard chronic 56 HCV treatment was a non-specific antiviral medication using ribavirin combined with a 57 pegylated interferon-\u03b1, which was associated with significant toxicity and limited treatment 58 efficacy (7). In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first generation of 59 direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV: boceprevir and telaprevir, both of which inhibit the 60 viral protease (NS3/4A) but required cotreatment with ribavirin and peginterferon (8, 9). Further 61 approval of more potent DAAs, such as NS3/4A, NS5B and NS5A inhibitors led to the 62 development of oral ribavirin/peginterferon-free regimens (5). Multi-DAA regimens achieve 63 4 sustained virologic response (defined as a period of time with no viral RNA detection) rates as 64 high as 100%, and are less toxic and more tolerable than their predecessors (10-13). While the 65 cure rates are remarkable, there exist populations of patients who may not benefit from DAA 66 therapy (14), especially patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to chronic HCV infection, for 67 whom liver transplantation may be a last resort (15). Moreover, recurrent infection occurs 68 universally and rapidly post liver transplantation (16, 17), which increases the risk of accelerated 69 cirrhosis, graft failure and death (18). DAAs, by their nature, cannot prevent recurrent infection. 70 Therefore, alternative or complementary therapies to DAAs that can block viral entry to target 71 cells, such as antibodies or other molecules acting alike, may need to be considered in these 72 circumstances (18, 19). However, there is currently no entry inhibitor approved for HCV 73 treatment. 74 The HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2 are heavily glycosylated and, like glycoproteins 75 of other enveloped viruses (HIV and the coronaviruses, for instance), have a high proportion of 76 high-mannose-type N-glycans (HMGs) on their surface (20-22). These glycans are typically 77 processed to hybrid and complex forms on glycoproteins secreted by healthy cells (23). Thus, the 78 HMGs on the surface of HCV may be considered a druggable target. We have previously 79 described the development of an HMG-targeting lectin-Fc fusion protein, or \"lectibody\", called 80 Avaren-Fc (AvFc), which was shown to bind with high affinity to clusters of HMGs on the HIV 81 envelope protein gp120 and effectively neutralize multiple HIV clades and groups including 82 HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (24). Further analysis indicated that AvFc can bind to 83 HCV E2 protein (24). Therefore, in this study, we aim to investigate the anti-HCV therapeutic 84 potential of AvFc in in vitro neutralization assays and an in vivo HCV challenge study using 85 PXB-mice\u00ae, a chimeric uPA/SCID mouse model transplanted with human hepatocytes (25).",

In order to facilitate in vivo studies 195 we screened for an optimal liquid formulation for systemic administration that can impart 196 improved stability and solubility to AvFc at higher concentrations. Initial buffer screening 197 revealed that AvFc is prone to degradation at and below pH 6.5, suggesting that AvFc is not 198 stable in acidic pH conditions ( Figure S1 ). Further pre-formulation studies led us to identify an 199 optimal buffer composed of 30 mM histidine, pH 7.0, 100 mM sucrose and 100 mM NaCl. Figure 1 ). Consequently, these results suggested that administration of the drug every other day 216 (Q2D) might be sufficient to keep the virus under control in a murine HCV challenge model. 217 We then assessed the safety of Q2D administration of AvFc in PXB-mice\u00ae. To 218 effectively discern potential toxicity associated with AvFc's HMG-binding activity, we included 219 an AvFc variant lacking HMG-binding activity as a control (AvFc lec-; Figure S2 ). PXB mice 220 received either the vehicle (the histidine buffer described above) Q2D for 11 total doses, AvFc at 221 25 mg/kg Q2D for a total of 8 or 11 doses, or AvFc lecat 25 mg/kg Q2D for 11 total doses. As 222 shown in Figure 4A -C, no significant differences in either body weights, blood h-Alb levels or weight were seen ( Figure 4D ).

            "text": "The mechanism of HCV neutralization by AvFc is likely through binding to HMGs on 258 the E1/E2 envelope protein dimer, which blocks their interaction with host cell receptors and 259 viral entry. Unlike HIV envelope glycoproteins, whose glycan content can vary widely between 260 strains, the number and position of glycosylation sites on E1/E2 are highly conserved, indicating 261 their critical role in HCV's infectious processes (37). The notion that AvFc functions as an entry 262 inhibitor is supported by the facts that the lectibody has affinity to the E2 protein (24) The present study also demonstrated that AvFc therapy is well tolerated in mice and 275 human hepatocytes, as Q2D i.p. administration of 25 mg/kg of AvFc up to 11 doses did not show 276 any obvious toxicity in PXB mice by gross necropsy or histopathology of engrafted human 277 hepatocytes, nor did it result in significant changes in body weight, h-Alb, or ALT levels ( Figure   278 3, 4). We hypothesize that the lack of any significant toxicity is attributable to AvFc's unique 279 HMG-binding mechanism, whereby it requires multivalent interaction with several HMGs in 280 proximity to exhibit high affinity binding to a glycoprotein target. In line with this hypothesis, prolonged exposure to a carbohydrate-binding agent like AvFc, may result in significant decrease in viral fitness by decreasing E1/E2 incorporation into HCV particles or increased 317 susceptibility to humoral immunity due to breach in the glycan shield (37, 51). Our results 318 provide a foundation to test the above hypotheses and feasibility of the HMG-targeting anti-HCV 319 strategy.",

Similar to the results in overall no major toxicity signal was noted in body weights, h-Alb or h-Alt levels between the test groups although there was a temporal drop in body weight and h-Alb in one of 248 the AvFc-treated group at an early timepoint, indicating that the liver grafts remained functional 249 over the course of the study(Figure 6Bstudy we demonstrated that the HMG-binding lectibody AvFc exhibits broad253 genotype-independent anti-HCV activity.

AvFc inhibited multiple genotypes of HCV with an average IC 50 over 100-fold lower 265 than that of the monomer Avaren lectin (Table 1), indicating that the multivalent recognition of 266 HMGs on the surface of the virus, brought about by the dimerization of Avaren via Fc fusion, led 267 to greater entry inhibition. Unlike other antiviral lectins, however, the inclusion of the human 268 IgG1 Fc region implicates the possibility of Fc-mediated effector functions, such as antibody-269 dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, against infected cells. In fact, Fc-mediated effector functions greatly contributed to the antiviral potency of AvFc against HIV, as determined by a 271 primary cell-based inhibition assay and an antibody-dependent cell-mediated viral inhibition 272 assay (24). Accordingly, the remarkable efficacy seen in the present in vivo HCV challenge study 273 may be partially Fc-mediated. Further investigations are necessary to address this possibility.274",

            "text": "281 Hoque et al. demonstrated that the three binding pockets of the parent lectin actinohivin can bind 282 up to three independent HMGs, providing high affinity binding when the HMGs are in relatively 283 close proximity (40). This implies that AvFc may not effectively interact with healthy normal 284 cells and tissues that do not usually exhibit clusters of HMGs on their surfaces. In contrast, 285 glycoproteins of many enveloped viruses display a high proportion of these immature forms of 286 N-glycans (20-22). While HCV E2 has fewer N-glycosylation sites (around 11) than the HIV 287 glycoprotein gp120 (which has between 20 and 30 depending on the strain), E2 is likely present 288 on the surface of HCV at a higher density and thus provides higher local concentrations of 289 HMGs (41). Further studies are necessary to reveal a threshold HMG concentration which 290 enables efficient interaction between AvFc and the surfaces of cells or viruses. 291 While alcoholic liver disease has now surpassed HCV infection as the number one 292 indication for liver transplantation in the US, a large number of procedures will continue to be performed for the foreseeable future in patients with HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis (42). 294 A major outstanding issue is the lack of effective treatment protecting the allograft liver from 295 recurrent infection by the virus that remained circulating in the periphery at the time of 296 transplant. As a consequence, reinfection of donor livers universally occurs, as early as in the 297 first 90 minutes upon reperfusion (17), and can result in accelerated fibrosis and increased risk of 298 graft failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (43). In fact, allograft failure due to 299 reinfection is the leading cause of secondary transplants and death in HCV-infected patients who 300 have received liver transplant (44), Patients cured of HCV with DAAs after liver transplantation 301 still have a higher than normal risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (45), and the high cost of the 302 drugs represents a significant barrier to their widespread use. Furthermore, emergent drug 303 resistance even in DAA combination therapies, though rare, represents a particular challenge for 304 further treatment (46). Thus, while the effectiveness of DAAs is not in question, there are still 305 unmet needs that may be addressed through the use of entry inhibitors. As of yet, no entry 306 inhibitor has been approved for the treatment or prevention of HCV. Two major drug candidates, 307 Civacir\u00ae and MBL-HCV1, have shown some promise in clinical trials (NCT01804829, 308 NCT01532908) (47, 48). Though larger studies are needed, it appears that entry inhibitors in 309 combination with DAAs may represent a new treatment paradigm for HCV patients receiving 310 liver transplant. Despite that both MBL-HCV1 and Civacir\u00ae are capable of neutralizing a broad 311 range of HCV genotypes, viral resistance can still develop through mutations in the envelope 312 proteins E1/E2, in particular through shifting glycan positions (49, 50). In this regard, AvFc in its 313 own right could be less susceptible to amino acid mutations because it targets the glycan shield 314 of the virus rather than a specific epitope.
