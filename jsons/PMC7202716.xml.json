Category B notifiable infectious diseases are required to be reported within 24 hours5; however there is a delay in the release of official statistics, that is, 1\u20133 weeks for syphilis and gonorrhoea, 2 months for HIV/AIDS. The use of search data can potentially overcome publication delays and help health facilities such as medical institutions and community health organisations to make preemptive and preventative treatment plans. In addition, due to the secular stigma and discrimination against STDs, people at risk of infection tend to search for testing services, while infected people tend to seek treatment and care services on the internet as an initial step,6 instead of attending healthcare facilities. This makes it difficult for health authorities to monitor true HIV/STDs epidemics. There is a possibility that more people\u2019s information can be covered like undiagnosed people as a supplement by following the tendency of relevant statistics based on the internet.",

It could involve more than one variable and explain past and causal relationships among multiple variables over time, as well as predict future observations.28 The structure is that each variable is a linear function of its own past lags and the past lags of the other variables. The incidence of diseases/infections and search data were usually autocorrelated itself and cross-correlated with the other. By evaluating the time lags, the final VAR model would include real incidence data and internet search data which have the potential to make the predictions more stable. However, there has been no studies using VAR model to predict the incidence of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea. We aimed to use Baidu search data in combination with previously diagnosed cases through a VAR model to monitor and predict newly diagnosed cases of HIV/AIDS, syphilis and gonorrhoea, and compare the different incidence-search patterns.",

The coefficients of trend terms were all positive, which illustrated an overall uptrend of the number of newly diagnosed cases for three infections/diseases during 2011\u20132017. In a cycle of full year, the trend of all newly diagnosed cases showed cyclical change. All infections/diseases started to rise at the beginning of the year and decline at different rates by January next year. In addition, the peak value of HIV/AIDS occurred each December may be attributed to the free testing services on World AIDS Day. Figure 2 showed the VAR models fitted well with the real data and the prediction could catch the periodicity and uptrend character especially for HIV/AIDS and gonorrhoea.

Besides, the number of newly diagnosed cases of infectious diseases were autocorrelated and using multivariate model could explain the relationship by selecting an appropriate lag length. Figure 2 depicted there were seasonal periodicity for all three HIV/STD, dropping abruptly from January to February, which may attribute to the testing intention reduction of people during the Spring Festival, then going up from February and tending to be stable after several waves in December except for the cases of HIV/AIDS, it possibly due to test promotion activities during World AIDS Day. Compared with syphilis, HIV/AIDS and gonorrhoea models have a longer correlation between the number of newly diagnosed cases and search data. It shall be noted that because the uptrend was more stable, the prediction curve fitted well for HIV/AIDS. As shown in figure 2, there was a rise of incidence in 2017 for syphilis and gonorrhoea, which was different from past years, making the prediction curve lower than true incidence curve. This may be caused by government\u2019s effort on publicity of health education and people\u2019s attention to syphilis and gonorrhoea testing which were more likely to be deficient than HIV/AIDS in previous years.",

Restricted to the limited time span, whether the VAR model was applicable for the prediction in a much longer period of time needed further verification.
