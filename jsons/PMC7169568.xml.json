            "text": "Establishment of an efficient immune response to infections is highly dependent on rapid recruitment of cells of the immune system to infected areas. In this process, chemokines play a pivotal role [1, 2]. Chemokines constitute a group of small, secreted peptides with chemotactic and pro\u2010inflammatory activities. They are classified into CC, CXC, C and CX3C chemokines, based on the numbers and mutual placement of cysteines in the N\u2010terminal region of proteins [3]. Chemokine receptors are seven\u2010transmembrane spanning, G\u2010protein\u2010coupled receptors that are expressed primarily on leucocytes [1, 4]. The pattern of chemokine receptor expression is highly cell type dependent and is also affected by the state of differentiation and activation of the cells [5, 6]. Many chemokine receptors can bind several different chemokines, and likewise, most chemokines can work as ligand for more than one receptor. For instance, CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 1 is a receptor for macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)\u20101\u03b1/CCL3 and MIP\u20101\u03b3/CCL9, regulated upon activation, normally T\u2010cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)/CCL5 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)\u20103/CCL7, whereas CCR5 serves as a receptor for CCL3, MIP\u20101\u03b2/CCL4, CCL5 and MCP\u20102/CCL8 [3, 7]. Although chemokines were first recognized as chemotactic molecules for leucocytes [8], more recently, a number of other functions have been elucidated. These include leucocyte activation, induction of cytokine and chemokine expression, leucocyte degranulation and also developmental roles [3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].",

            "text": "Chemokines have been demonstrated to play beneficial as well as deleterious roles in many kinds of diseases and pathologic conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases and transplant rejections [2, 3, 14, 15]. Concerning the role of chemokines in host defence against viral infections, most attention has been drawn to CCR1 and CCR5 and their ligands, because these receptors seem to be associated with a T helper 1 (Th1)\u2010type of immune response, which is generally considered to be protective against viruses [16, 17, 18]. Using mice deficient in specific genes of the chemokine system, it has been shown that CCL3 and CCR1 are important for resistance against certain viral infections [19, 20]. Also, CCR5 deficiency in humans increases the susceptibility to hepatitis C virus infections [21], and mice lacking this receptor display increased mortality rate after influenza virus infection [22]. However, lack of CCR5 can also be associated with beneficial modulation of the immune response, as evidenced by other studies in CCR5\u2010deficient (CCR5\u2013/\u2013) mice. Infection with a neurotropic coronavirus resulted in reduced demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS), which correlated with reduced recruitment of macrophages into the brain of CCR5\u2013/\u2013 when compared with wild\u2010type mice [23]. These results indicate that although chemokines in many instances are necessary for mounting an efficient immune response, in other cases they may contribute to an overwhelming immune response, eventually causing tissue damage.",

Infection by HSV\u20101 may give rise to cold sore and, in rare cases, encephalitis, whereas HSV\u20102 is mainly responsible for genital and neonatal herpes. We have previously shown that HSV infection in vitro leads to expression of many inflammatory mediators [24, 25, 26], whereas only a small subset of chemokines are produced [27]. In this study, we have evaluated the role of CCR1, CCR5 and their ligands during a generalized HSV\u20102 infection in vivo in mice. The results presented here show that CCR1 and/or CCR5 are essential for establishment of an efficient antiviral response during a systemic HSV\u20102 infection. Moreover, our data point towards an immunoregulatory role of these two chemokine receptors at later stages when the virus has been cleared.",

For TNF\u2010\u03b1, no upregulation was seen on days 1 and 3 in either group, nor on day 6 in the HSV\u20102\u2010infected group. In the group receiving HSV\u20102 + Met\u2010RANTES, however, the levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1 were significantly elevated on day 6. IL\u201012 was also detected at higher concentrations on day 6 in the group of mice given HSV\u20102 + Met\u2010RANTES than in the group given HSV\u20102 alone, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). Finally, the levels of NO, an inflammatory mediator which is part of the innate immune response to many viruses [31, 32], were significantly higher on day 6 in the HSV\u20102 + Met\u2010RANTES group.",

            "text": "Studies by others have shown that, in particular, CCL3 and CCL5 are induced during viral infections [33, 39, 40, 41, 42]. Moreover, CCL3 seems to be essential for defence against several virus infections, including influenza virus, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) [19, 20, 34]. Salazar\u2010Mather et al. [43] demonstrated that IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2\u2010induced accumulation of NK cells in the liver during MCMV infection is dependent on CCL3. NK cells have long been recognized to represent a major mediator of early defence against many viruses, including herpesviruses [44]. In our studies, we found that expression of CCL5 was induced in the liver and peritoneal cavity (seen at the levels of both mRNA and protein) after HSV\u20102 infection and, weakly, in brain and spleen after HSV\u20102 infection (found at the level of mRNA but not protein). CCL3 expression was induced in the peritoneal cavity (mRNA and protein) but only weakly in the brain (mRNA not protein) and not in detectable amounts in the liver or spleen. The induction of, notably, CCL5, but also some of the other chemokines examined, was detected immediately prior to, or coincident with, peak leucocyte numbers in the peritoneum as well as upregulation of CCR1 and CCR5 in the liver and spleen, an indication of accumulation of immune cells bearing these receptors. Also, in the liver, the elevation in cells expressing CCR1 and CCR5 correlated with a decrease in viral titres. Our findings therefore suggest that the pattern of chemokine expression evoked by virus infections differs between viruses and may suggest that other CCR1 and CCR5 ligands than CCL3 could be important for antiviral defence.",

            "text": "We also examined the effect of the CCR1 and CCR5 antagonist Met\u2010RANTES on HSV\u20102 infection. In vitro, Met\u2010RANTES has been shown to antagonize the chemotactic effect of CCL3 and CCL5 on T cells, monocytes and eosinophils [29, 45, 46]. In vivo, murine studies have focused on the effect of Met\u2010RANTES on inflammatory diseases, e.g. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis and colitis, and results have shown some effect on clinical and inflammatory parameters [47, 48, 49]. As to infections, Stumbles and colleagues [50] found that treatment with Met\u2010RANTES in rats inhibited dendritic cell (DC) influx to tracheal epithelium in response to bacterial challenge but had no effect on the DC response to Sendai virus infection. We found that co\u2010treatment with Met\u2010RANTES led to significantly higher HSV\u20102 titres in liver on day 1 and day 6 after infection. In particular, the marked reduction in viral titres in the liver between day 3 and day 6 in HSV\u20102\u2010infected BALB/c mice, which correlates with our finding that CCR1 and CCR5 were upregulated between days 3 and 6, was less pronounced in infected mice co\u2010treated with Met\u2010RANTES. This could indicate that recruitment of a CCR1+/CCR5+ cell population is important for mounting an efficient antiviral response in the liver. However, T\u2010cell migration to the liver was not affected, and accumulation of NK cells was increased in Met\u2010RANTES\u2010treated mice 6 days after infection (S\u00f8rensen and Paludan, unpublished data). Another possible explanation for the increased viral titres in the liver could be a higher viral load delivered to the liver, owing to impaired initial antiviral response in the peritoneal cavity, where accumulation of NK cells and granulocytes was significantly decreased on day 1. Both these cell types have been documented to possess antiviral activity towards HSV [44, 51, 52, 53]. Third, direct chemokine\u2010mediated activation of antiviral mechanisms in the liver, e.g. activation of Kupffer's cells, may also have been blocked by Met\u2010RANTES. Higher viral titres were also detected in the brain (day 6) and spleen (days 3 and 6), although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Again, the reason could be increased viral load delivered to organs, owing to impaired initial response in the peritoneal cavity. However, the blocked CCR5 activity in the brain could also be important, as CCR5 has been shown to have a role in the antiviral response and virus\u2010mediated pathology in CNS as well as immunity to nonviral pathogens in CNS [23, 54]. Altogether, our results show that Met\u2010RANTES, which blocks CCR1 and CCR5, impairs the antiviral response to a generalized HSV\u20102 infection. CCR1 and CCR5 have been previously found to contribute to antiviral defence in respiratory infection with PVM [20]. In other viral infections, however, CCR1 and CCR5 have not been found to play important roles in antiviral response. For instance, CCR1 deficiency had no effect on titres or leucocyte migration in respiratory syncytial virus infection [55], and viral titres were also unaffected by CCR5 deficiency in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in mice [56].",

This observation could be explained by alternations in important regulatory mechanisms following treatment with Met\u2010RANTES, hence suggesting immunoregulatory roles for CCR1 and CCR5. Alternatively, it could simply be a cellular response to ongoing viral replication and increased antigen load in mice co\u2010treated with Met\u2010RANTES. However, we did not detect virus in the peritoneal cavity at day 6 after infection of either mouse infected with HSV\u20102 alone or after co\u2010treatment with Met\u2010RANTES (data not shown). Moreover, the literature and our results argue against prolonged presence of virus as responsible for the elevated production of pro\u2010inflammatory mediators. First, IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 production was upregulated only on day 1 in mice given HSV\u20102 + Met\u2010RANTES, contrary to a more sustained expression expected if the infection persisted in the peritoneum. Second, studies from this laboratory have shown that the capacity of HSV\u20102 to induce the production of IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2 in PCs is independent of viral replication [57], thus arguing that not even viral antigen is present in the peritoneal cavity day 6 after infection. Finally, studies by other groups have indicated important immunoregulatory roles for CCR1 and CCR5 in infection with viral and nonviral pathogens [12, 56, 58, 59]. For instance, it was demonstrated that CCR5\u2010deficient mice display enhanced macrophage infiltration, tissue damage and mortality after influenza virus infection, despite unchanged viral titres, hence strongly indicating a possible regulatory role for CCR5 [22]. Also, regulatory T cells express CCR5 and are recruited to inflamed areas by the ligands of this receptor to participate in the regulation of the immune response [60]. Therefore, we believe that blocking of CCR1 and CCR5, in addition to impeding central antiviral activities, uncouples important immunoregulatory processes and hence leads to impairment of some of the postinfectious control mechanisms.",
