Validation of upper and lower respiratory samples was focused on providing qualitative results. Positivity was defined as a cycle threshold (C T ) value < 38.0. This cutoff was derived from the mean C T value at the limit of detection plus approx. two standard deviations. Sensitivity of the assay, expressed as limit of detection, is 73 copies/mL. Although the intended use of the assay is to report qualitative results, linearity and dynamic range were assessed and demonstrated from 2.77 to 8.77 log 10 copies/mL (slope = -3.32, y-intercept = 41.2, R 2 = 0.9998), with C T values from 31.56 to 12.05 in the linear range of the assay. During review of laboratory results, we occasionally observed very low C T values (i.e. <10) from patient samples, suggesting extremely high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens.

Overall 14.9% (4,428) of samples tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The distribution of positive samples by log 10 copies/mL and C T values is shown in Figure 1 . The overall viral load range of positive samples was 0.91 to 10.42 log 10 copies/mL (C T 6.16 -37.92) with a mean of 5.85 log 10 copies/mL and median of 6.05 log 10 copies/mL.

In Table 2 , viral load results are shown by specimen type and patient gender. A majority of samples received (69.3% or 20,603 of 29,713) did not have the specific specimen type identified.

While some studies only report C T values, which may vary between methods, these results provide a reasonable approximation of viral load. Lack of a common standard makes comparison of calculated viral load values between studies an approximation as well. A study of 82 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed viral loads of 4 to 8 log 10 copies/mL in throat swabs and sputum from -1 to 15 days post-onset of clinical symptoms with occasional sputum samples having 10 to 11 log 10 copies/mL (Pan et al., 2020) . A second study of 17 symptomatic patients reported C T values as low as 13 in both throat and nasal swabs of one patient, with a majority samples having C T values >20 in the early clinical period (Zou et al., 2020) . Wang et al. (2020) reported C T values > 17 in similarly collected specimens. Viral load kinetics have also been studied with peak reported values of approx. 8 log 10 copies/mL (Kim et al., 2020) and 9 log 10 copies/mL (W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020) , both in upper respiratory specimens. Initial and peak mean viral loads of 6.17 and 6.91 log 10 copies/mL, respectively, have also been reported for 10 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients severe disease; J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f values were 10-fold lower (initial viral load) and 30-fold lower (peak viral load) in 13 patients with mild disease by . Viral loads in respiratory samples from patients infected with other respiratory coronaviruses have also been reported. In 14 patients infected with SARS-CoV-1, peak viral loads of approx. 5.5 to 8.5 log 10 /mL were documented in nasopharyngeal aspirates (Peiris et al., 2003) . For patients with severe MERS, peak viral loads in sputum or tracheal aspirates ranged from 6 -9 log 10 copies/mL while mild cases were at least 100-fold lower (Oh et al., 2016) . Viral load results for common respiratory coronaviruses such as strains NL63 and OC43 are generally 1,000-to 10,000-fold lower compared to peak values for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS (Lassauni\u00e8re et al., 2010) .",

Most importantly, the proportion of samples tested from symptomatic patients versus asymptomatic individuals was not known, nor is it known when samples were collected relative to the time of symptom onset for those patients suffering from disease. Therefore the overall prevalence of positivity is minimally significant and the prevalence by birth year may well be skewed based on likelihood of sampling due to age or occupation.
