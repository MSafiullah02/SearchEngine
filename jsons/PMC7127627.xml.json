The act of catching and treating young calves puts farmers and ranchers at risk of physical injury by the calf or dam, and many producers are disheartened by seeing calves become sick or die at only 1 or 2 weeks of age. Finally, there may be public health risks associated with some outbreaks of neonatal calf diarrhea because (1) some diarrhea pathogens of calves also make people sick and (2) an important reason for using antibiotics on many beef and dairy farms is to treat young calves for diarrhea.",

Veterinarians investigating outbreaks of neonatal calf diarrhea must first make recommendations for treating affected calves and then take action to protect susceptible and unborn calves from ongoing illness. Finally, attention should focus on determining what future actions might prevent the disease in subsequent calving periods or seasons.4 Although knowledge of the pathogens involved is often useful information, outbreak investigations sometimes become sidetracked in the sole pursuit of an etiologic agent rather than identifying more useful explanations for the outbreak. Knowing the etiologic agent may provide an explanation for the proximal cause of a calf\u2019s illness or death, but that knowledge rarely explains the outbreak or provides a solution for treatment, control, or prevention. The goal, then, is to conduct a useful outbreak investigation\u2014one that leads to a solution to the problem.",

If records exist at all, they may be on paper (eg, in pocket-sized ranch books) or in an electronic format with free text fields, none of which allow the veterinarian or the producer to quickly and easily discover animal health relationships. Some electronic record-keeping systems capture health information and may present information in standard graphs or summaries, but do not allow easy querying of health relationships. Free text fields are difficult or impossible to analyze because of misspelled words, multiple names, or descriptors for the same disease (eg, diarrhea, scours, loose, enteric) and multiple pieces of information in the same field (eg, scours, T103.8, bolus and fluids, retreat afternoon, watch out for the cow). The lack of a simple record-keeping system has hindered many disease outbreak investigations. It simply becomes too costly to wade through inefficient record systems to get the needed information from which questions can be asked. A desirable system for investigating neonatal calf diarrhea is one that captures individual calf information for all calves at risk, not just affected calves. Useful information includes the calf\u2019s identification, the identification of the dam, the age of the dam, the calf\u2019s birth date, the date of onset of the illness, the date of onset of other illnesses, and information describing various risk factors of interest.",

Diarrhea is a subjective diagnosis and accompanying clinical signs (eg, dehydration, fever, and level of depression) may or may not be relevant to the specific syndrome associated with the outbreak of interest. For example, the complaint may be about high mortality in calves developing diarrhea at 1 to 3 weeks\u2019 of age. So, do you count as cases calves with fever or dehydration but no observed diarrhea? What about calves with diarrhea at 60 days\u2019 of age or calves with distended abdomens and pasty stools? The definition of a case is not always obvious but it is important. Having a reasonable level of specificity in the case definition is necessary to avoid the confusion of looking for a single solution to more than one problem. However, overspecifying the case definition may cause confusion because only part of the problem is being investigated.",

Only a subset of animals in a population may be at risk for a given disease based on various conditions or characteristics, including age, gender, breed, physical location, and so forth (eg, only females are at risk for pregnancy and only pregnant cows are at risk for abortion).

This process may be iterative because there may be refinements in the case definition and the definition of the population at risk as the outbreak is reconstructed.

If neonatal diarrhea cases are ongoing, pathogen diagnostics may be helpful to the investigation (see article by Blanchard in this issue). For example, it may be useful to know if the pathologic condition is caused by bacterial or viral pathogens because that knowledge may guide treatment decisions, lead to hypotheses about routes and sources of exposure, or create awareness of zoonotic potential. Also, serologic responses or even recovery of the agent are not necessarily clear indications that the pathogen is a primary pathogen in the condition being investigated. The recovery of one pathogen may not mean that there are not other players, and the relative prevalence of agents recovered from neonatal calf diarrhea cases may simply reflect the relative ease of detecting the agent. Finally, diagnostics for the purpose of outbreak investigation are almost always conducted to answer population-based questions. Rarely is the question about what pathogen is causing diarrhea in a particular calf. More often the question is whether to and how to adequately test for pathogens that are affecting the health of the herd.",

Therefore, confirmatory testing using a test of high specificity (eg, serial testing) may be important.26 For example, a single bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)-positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test result might lead the investigator to think BVDV is circulating in the herd, taking the investigation and proposed corrective actions down a particular (and possibly costly) path. Confirmatory testing (eg, using immunohistochemistry) might be prudent before going down that path.

This multiplier effect can result in high calf infectivity and widespread environmental contamination with pathogens.46 Each calf serves as growth media for pathogen production, amplifying the dose load of the pathogen it received.35, 36, 37 Therefore, calves born later in a calving season may receive larger dose loads of pathogens and, in turn, may become relatively more infective by growing even greater numbers of agents. Eventually, the dose load of pathogens overwhelms the calf\u2019s ability to resist disease. These factors alone or in combination may explain observations that calves born later in the calving season are at greater risk for disease or death (Fig. 4\n).31, 32\n",

In disease causal theory, each factor that contributes to the development of disease is a component cause. Disease is observed when various component causes add up to complete a sufficient cause, which explains why some component causes are observed in the absence of disease (eg, we might recover Cryptosporidia from the feces of calves without diarrhea). This concept also explains why the manager of a herd that does a good job of assuring passive transfer might blame calf diarrhea on bad weather, whereas the manager of a herd in a moderate climate might observe diarrhea when they have been lax about assuring adequate colostrum intake. Removing one component cause means that the sufficient cause is not completed and, thus, disease is not observed.47 For example, one sufficient cause for neonatal calf diarrhea might include component causes of (1) exposure to rotavirus, (2) failure of passive transfer, and (3) weather stress. In the absence of other completed sufficient causes, the removal of any one of these factors would keep calves from developing diarrhea. In general, the objective of the investigation is to determine which possible component causes are contributing to the completion of a sufficient cause and determine which component causes (also known as causal factors or risk factors) are key determinants. Key determinants are those causal factors that can be modified. In the simple example described earlier, we might find it difficult to prevent exposure to rotavirus or correct the weather, so improving passive transfer might be the key determinant.",

Some causal factors are characteristics of individuals; other causes are characteristics of groups or herds. If the important causal factors occur at the herd level, it will not be possible to measure this association by comparing (statistically or otherwise) affected and nonaffected calves within a single herd. For example, if an important causal factor is the presence of BVDV circulating among cattle in the herd, it is likely that all calves become exposed to the virus, whether they get sick or not. The inference that BVDV is contributing to disease comes from comparing its presence in this herd with what is expected or observed in other herds.

A causal factor might also be identified by the method of difference if a particular factor differs, whereas others remain the same (eg, if calves receiving milk replacer from one bag develop diarrhea, but calves on the same farm receiving milk replacer from another bag do not). Finally, causal relationships may be revealed by the method of concomitant variations if the risk for the outcome changes with the level of the risk factor, all other factors being the same (eg, the more time that calves remain in the maternity pen, the greater the incidence of diarrhea).",

However, the endemic nature of the common pathogens of neonatal calf diarrhea makes it unlikely that cattle populations could be made biosecure from these agents; therefore, a biocontainment approach to control neonatal calf diarrhea seems prudent and logical.55, 56 Biocontainment actions against neonatal diarrhea might include those that improve passive transfer of maternal antibodies or reducing effective contacts. Maternal immunity is important to calf resistance to enteric agents,11, 57 but maternal immunity wanes with time.28 Dairy producers might be able to improve maternal immunity by managing colostrum quality and quantity, but managers of extensive beef cattle systems have limited practical opportunities to improve rates of passive antibody transfer. In addition, vaccines are not available against all pathogens of calf diarrhea, may not induce sufficient cross-protection,40 and pathogens may evade the protection afforded by vaccination by evolving away from vaccine strains.58\n",

These principles have been successfully applied in calf hutch systems to control neonatal diseases in dairy calves.59 Various systems for biocontainment have been developed to prevent neonatal calf diarrhea in beef herds.60, 61, 62 Each of these are management strategies to prevent effective contacts by reducing the opportunities for exposure and subsequent transmission. For example, the Sandhills Calving System63 prevents effective contacts among beef calves by (1) segregating calves by age to prevent direct and indirect transmission of pathogens from older to younger calves and (2) scheduled movement of pregnant cows to clean calving pastures to minimize the pathogen dose load in the environment and minimizing contact time between calves and the larger portion of the cow herd.",
