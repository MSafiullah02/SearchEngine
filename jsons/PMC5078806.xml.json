            "text": "As typically observed for Braconidae, the venom apparatus of both Psyttalia species is composed of venom gland filaments (which secrete venom), a venom reservoir, and a venom duct that extends into the ovipositor (Fig. 1a). As was previously described in Opiinae1415, P. lounsburyi and P. concolor venom gland is multi-lobed, each lobe displaying an external thick layer of tissue and a central lumen filled by a large volume of venom (Fig. 1b,c). The gland lobes are joined together at the base where the ovoid shaped reservoir is connected. The reservoir is composed of a large muscular layer surrounding a small internal volume of venom, suggesting it may serve as a \u201cpump\u201d for injecting venom at the time of oviposition rather than as a storage organ. The reservoir also shows internal structures that form intricate spirals possibly involved in maintaining the shape of the reservoir, like spiral springs, by passively counteracting the muscular contraction (Fig. 1b,c). At the base of the venom apparatus of P. concolor, we also observed a \u201cround gland\u201d filled with large vesicles (Fig. 1c), already described by Quicke14 and called \u201cbasal bulb\u201d by Wharton15. Interestingly, the round gland and the intima spirals of the reservoir showed a strong endogenous green fluorescence (Fig. 1d), suggesting the presence of universal cellular auto-fluorophores such as NAD(P)H and flavins, pigments, or cuticular compounds16.",

We thus performed electron microscopy on P. concolor venom glands to search for VLPs, as well as on P. lounsburyi and P. concolor ovaries to ensure the absence of PDVs (polydnaviruses). We did not observe VLPs or vesicular material resembling VLPs in venom gland cells or venom (Fig. 2a), nor viral structures or PDV particles in the ovarian cells and fluid close to the eggs (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Accordingly, Pl and Pc transcriptomes contained no transcript having similarities with genes specific of nudiviruses (from which braconid PDVs derive) or the sister group of baculoviruses. As coronaviruses and cypo-like viruses were also described in P. concolor venom glands17, previous observations likely corresponded to small viruses infecting the reproductive tract of the samples, as reported also in other Hymenoptera19. In the absence of VLPs and PDVs, secreted venom proteins are likely the main maternal actors of parasitism success of Psyttalia species.",

Therefore, we only considered as putative venom proteins the unisequences (i) found in venom proteomics, and (ii) either predicted to be secreted or for which the presence of a signal peptide was not tested due to the incompleteness of the sequence. This resulted in a total of 32 and 30 putative venom proteins for Pl and Pc respectively (Tables 1 and 2), whose relative abundance was compared using (i) the RPKM normalized number of Illumina reads from Pl and Pc venom apparatus, mapped to the assembled transcriptomes and (ii) the number of peptides matches in Mascot searches.",

The high RPKM values and number of peptides matches confirmed that the Pl_002819 and Pc_001157 unisequences, that share 97% identity (Supplementary Figure S4), were among the most abundant in venom (Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The Pc sequence seems full-length, with a predicted signal peptide of 18 residues, while the Pl sequence probably lacks the N-terminal part (Supplementary Figure S4). The 56.5 kDa predicted MW of the mature protein is close to that of the observed spot on 2D gels, suggesting none or few glycosylation, although several N-glycosylation sites are predicted. Yet, several spots were observed, having different isoelectric points, suggesting post-translational modification(s) and thus several isoforms (Fig. 4). Two Pl and one Pc additional unisequences, not found in proteomics, shared similarities with GH1 \u03b2-glucosidases, suggesting occurrence of a multigene family (Supplementary Figure S5). GH1 \u03b2-glucosidases were previously identified in venomics data from M. demolitor and A. ervi, but they did not correspond to abundant proteins (Tables 1, 2 and 3).

Endoplasmin, also identified in transcriptomic data from both species (RPKM values of 40.85 for Pl and 63.9 for Pc) was detected in Pl venom only, suggesting a lower abundance in Pc venom (Tables 1 and 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), all these HSPs cooperate to form multi-chaperone complexes involved in the folding and export of secreted proteins. HSP70, PDI and endoplasmin are normally retained in the ER through the binding to specific receptors via a K/R/HDEL motif. Since these proteins are abundant in cells, we cannot totally exclude that their detection in the venom results from tissue contamination during venom collection from the gland. However, one of the venom PDIs, identified in both species, contains a substitution that changes the HDEL motif into a SDEL motif, suggesting a loss of binding and then of retention in the ER. Moreover, the binding of HSPs to ER receptors is labile and the retention is not absolute, allowing HSPs to be secreted and to play a role in intercellular transport and signaling2728. Endoplasmin, for example, has been associated as a chaperone with the secretion of pancreatic lipases and their further internalization by intestinal cells in rat29.",

Yet, very few studies were designed to evaluate how far closely-related parasitoid species differ in venom composition. Venom glands of the Braconidae M. hyperodae and M. aethiopoides were shown to express a similar set of genes20 but analyses relied on less than ten genes, and proteomics data were only available for M. hyperodae. More recently, we evidenced striking differences in venom composition of the closely-related Figitidae L. boulardi and L. heterotoma7, Drosophila parasitoids differing in their host range. We observed here a rather similar protein composition of the venom of P. lounsburyi and P. concolor, albeit they also differ in their host specificity level. The host range is determined by both behavioral and physiological traits that include host choice and venom adequacy to the host (i.e. \u201cvirulence\u201d). In some taxa, the diversity of venom composition could then be decoupled from the diversity of parasitized hosts in natura if specialization mainly relies on behavioral traits. For instance, although P. lounsburyi is a specialist of the olive fly in the field, it can develop in laboratory conditions on some non-natural hosts such as Ceratitis capitata. Similarly, although intraspecific variation in P. lounsburyi venom was notably evidenced for a LRR protein, the difference between Psyttalia strains from distant geographic origin was much lower than observed between L. boulardi strains7. Whether the level of diversity of venom differs among taxa (being lower in Braconidae than in Figitidae), or the extensive venom variation in Leptopilina wasps is specific of these genus/species remains an open and stimulating question.",

It is thus difficult to make assumptions about how these wasps counteract the host immune defense and regulate the host physiology, and whether they use similar mechanisms. Yet, the identification of a GH1 \u03b2-glucosidase as one of the most abundant venom protein in both species suggests a possible role of this protein in parasitoid wasp\u2019s success. In plants, glycoside compounds and hydrolytic enzymes form a classic two-component defense system, with glycosides inducing biological effects after being activated by the enzymes. The vast array of secondary metabolites produced is used as a protection against phytophagous organisms and pathogens3334. Hydrolysis-products can indeed be repellent or toxic to insects, nematodes, fungi and bacteria, and they also serve as volatile attractants for specialist herbivores and their parasitoids35.",

Oleuropein was shown to be converted into a toxic compound with a glutaraldehyde-like structure \u2013 a potent protein crosslinker \u2013 by a defense-related olive \u03b2-glucosidase41. Assuming that fly larvae use a sequestering mechanism to survive within fruits during development, the injection of Psyttalia venom \u03b2-glucosidase inside their body might result in a burst of toxic compounds that could weaken the host and increase the parasitoid probability of success. The release of sugar moieties from glycosides could also increase the amount of energy available for the developing parasitoid larvae. Although this is an attractive hypothesis, the fact remains that the alleged role of Psyttalia venom \u03b2-glucosidase is based on the sequestration of phenolic glycosides by the olive fly larvae, which has not been tested yet.",

Isoelectric focusing was run in two steps: a first run at 20 mA, 0.1 W/tube, 700 V for a total of 10,000 V/h, followed by a second run at 20 mA, 0.1 W/tube, 3,000 V for a total of 2,000 V/h. For the second dimension, 6\u201316% linear gradient SDS-PAGE was used. IEF gels were incubated with 4x Laemmli buffer containing \u00df-mercaptoethanol and loaded on top of the 1D SDS-PAGE. After separation, proteins were silver stained as previously described713.",

Data validation criteria were (i) one peptide with individual ion score above 50 (the Mascot significant identity threshold corresponding to p <0.05 is 45 in our case) or (ii) at least two peptides of individual ion score above 20 (corresponding to 1% probability that a peptide spectrum match is a random event). The Mascot score was calculated as -10*LOG10(P). The calculated FDR (based on an automatic decoy database search) ranged from 0 to 1.4% depending of the individual gel analysis. Mascot analysis was performed with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.30 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 0.30 Da. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was specified in Mascot as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. The maximum missed cleavage allowed was set to 2.",
