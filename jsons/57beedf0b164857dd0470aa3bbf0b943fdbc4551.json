Such metapopulation models describe disease spread on a number of spatial patches. In the first model considered, there is no explicit movement of individuals; rather infectives can pass the disease to susceptibles in other patches. The second type of model explicitly includes rates of travel between patches and also takes account of the resident patch as well as the current patch of individuals. A formula for and useful bounds on the basic reproduction number of the system are determined. Brief descriptions of application of this type of metapopulation model are given to investigate the spread of bovine tuberculosis and the effect of quarantine on the spread of influenza.",

They usually consist of a system (often a large system) of ordinary differential equations with the dynamics of each patch coupled to that of other patches by travel. A patch can be a city, community, or some other geographical region. If time is assumed discrete, then continuous space yields integrodifference equation models, whereas discrete space yields coupled lattice or cellular automata models [8, page 268] .",

The average infective period is taken as five days (\u03c4 = 5) giving \u03b3 = 73.0 year \u22121 , with \u03b2 = 0.0010107 year \u22121 infective \u22121 .

For p = 0.01, numerical simulations show I 1 and I 2 synchronized by about five years as they approach I \u221e given by (7.3) with damped oscillations. A stochastic formulation of this SIR model is also shown numerically to give synchronization, although a slightly larger value of p is required. Assuming that the within-patch contact rate is seasonally forced, in-phase and out of phase biennial oscillations are seen with chaotic solutions possible for some parameter values (illustrated in [9, Fig. 3 ] with p = 10 \u22123 ).

Further numerical investigations for n = 2 patches focus on a case in which in isolation the disease would be absent in patch 1 but endemic in patch 2 (i.e., R Fig. 3a ]. Another view of this case is presented in Fig. 7 .1 in which g 1 = g 2 and R 0 is plotted as a function of g 1 = g 2 , with R 0 = 1 shown as a broken horizontal line.

Sattenspiel and Dietz [11] suggested an application of their metapopulation SIR model to the spread of measles in the 1984 epidemic in Dominica. Travel rates of infants, schoolage children and adults are assumed to be different, thus making the model system highly complex and requiring knowledge of more data for simulation. Sattenspiel and coworkers; see [10] and references therein, have since used this modeling approach for studying other infectious diseases in the historical archives; one such example is discussed further in the next section. and God's Lake (population 299). Many of the inhabitants were fur trappers and Norway House was on a main trading route. Oxford House was in direct contact with Norway House, and God's Lake was connected to the other posts by less travelled routes. The influenza epidemic occurred in this region during the late fall of 1918 and the following winter. There were 107 deaths among residents of Norway House in a period of a year beginning in July 1918, with most of these probably from influenza. The time taken in winter to travel between Norway House and Oxford House was six days, a factor that slowed the spread of the disease, especially since influenza has a period of communicability of 3-5 days from clinical onset in adults [5, page 272 ]. Sattenspiel and Herring [12] used a fascinating mix of mathematical modeling and estimation of model parameters, both epidemiological parameters for influenza and anthropological parameters relating to population numbers and travel, to investigate the impact of attempts to limit travel during this influenza epidemic. Norway House was quarantined during December 1918 and January 1919, and this control measure is investigated. Quarantining here means the limit of travel of any individual regardless of disease status. The SIR model formulated for n patches [12, Sect. 3] is similar to the SIS model described in Sect. 7.3 above, except that birth and death are ignored (i.e., d = 0). Using the notation of Sect. 7.3, and letting R ij (t) denote the number of recovered individuals resident in patch i who are present in patch j at time t, the system of equations for individuals residing in patch i (with i = 1, ...n) is",
