Shortly after the first human influenza virus was isolated from ferrets in 1933 by Wilson Smith and colleagues at the National Institute for Medical Research in London [17] , it was discovered that human influenza viruses would cause disease in mice only if they were first adapted to the species by serial passages in the lungs [18] . This was subsequently found to be true for all human influenza virus isolates. One of the most commonly used human influenza viruses in mice is influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8), an H1N1 virus with a complex passage history, including several passages in ferrets, and hundreds of passages in eggs and mice (CB Smith, CDC, Atlanta, GA, personal communication). This virus is well adapted to mice and causes a lethal infection. The need for adaptation through serial passage of human influenza viruses is one of the major drawbacks of using mice in influenza research, because many mutations can arise during adaptation to the murine host; [19] [20] [21] [22] these can alter their replication kinetics, and can result in the ability of the virus to escape the host innate immune responses [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 287, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 444, "end": 448, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1090, "end": 1094, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1099, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1104, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1109, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1244, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mice"}, {"text": "Influenza viruses that cause disease and are lethal for mice provide a useful endpoint for vaccine efficacy studies. Depending on the strain of virus used, mice may become lethargic, anorexic, develop ruffled fur, and may also exhibit neurological symptoms of infection, in addition to weight loss, which is often the primary objective measure of the severity of infection. Body temperature is not a useful NtAb neutralizing antibody c ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay measurement in mice because hypothermia can occur following infection with mouse-adapted viruses. Irrespective of whether an influenza virus induces morbidity or mortality in mice, the level of replication of influenza viruses in the lungs is the most informative endpoint for efficacy studies in mice since even a modest reduction in titer of infectious virus in the lungs can be associated with survival from lethal infection [24, 25] . Mice immunized with influenza viruses or vaccines develop serum HAI and neutralizing antibodies, the titers of which correlate with protection from subsequent challenge. Studies by Virelizier [26] demonstrated that antibody alone could protect against influenza infection in mice. Passive transfer of immune serum to naive mice resulted in a reduction in the replication of virus in the lungs and protected the recipient mice from lethal influenza pneumonitis, but did not prevent tracheitis or replication of virus in the upper respiratory tract [27] . The observation that passively transferred serum antibodies can reduce pulmonary viral replication but not viral replication in the upper respiratory tract is not unique to influenza A. Similar observations have been reported with influenza C virus [28] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [29] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections [30] . Measuring the amount of virus in various tissues in cases where high levels of serum antibody are present, for example, when vaccines are administered with adjuvant, should be done by quantitative molecular methods to rule out the possibility of ex vivo neutralization by serum antibody during tissue preparation. Such ex vivo neutralization has been shown to account for a reduction of up to 300-fold in detectable virus in the lungs of mice that had undergone passive transfer of immune serum against SARS-CoV [30] .

The disadvantages of the ferret as a model for studying influenza vaccines include expense, special housing requirements, a limited number of suppliers, difficulties in obtaining animals that are seronegative for influenza virus, their exquisite sensitivity to other respiratory pathogens and ease of acquiring infection from their handlers, and the lack of species-specific reagents, although this last point does not present an obstacle for the evaluation of HAI and neutralizing antibody responses.

Standard toxicology tests on new vaccine candidates are often performed in rabbits, although current WHO guidelines for nonclinical evaluation of vaccines recommend that toxicology studies be performed in an animal species that most closely reflects the immune response to the vaccine in humans, or is \"sensitive to the biological effects of the vaccine\", and use the same dose and route of administration to be studied in clinical trials [58] .

The pathogenicity of human and avian H9 influenza viruses in mice has been studied by several laboratories, with a view of establishing an animal model that can be used to study strategies for prevention of pandemic influenza, including vaccines and antiviral drugs. Some H9 influenza viruses replicate in the respiratory tract of mice without prior adaptation [128, [132] [133] [134] , but serial passage of the A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2) virus in mice resulted in an increase in the virulence and in the extrapulmonary spread and lethality of this virus in intranasally infected mice [132, 133] .

Similarly, a lethal challenge of mice with the human influenza A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) virus was reported as part of a study to determine the efficacy of an M2 liposome vaccine [135] , although this virus did not cause disease or lethality in the hands of other investigators [134, 136, 137] .

A single intranasal dose of each vaccine virus elicited serum neutralizing and HAI antibody, and fully protected mice against replication of the wild-type parent H6 AI virus in the lower respiratory tract. Cross-reactive antibody titers against heterologous H6 viruses were significantly lower than against the homologous parent virus. A second dose of vaccine in mice boosted the antibody titers, and improved cross-protection against the heterologous H6 AI viruses. As had been seen in the initial studies in mice, the level of neutralizing antibody elicited by the H6 candidate vaccines was a poor predictor of their ability to cross-protect against antigenically distinct H6 AI viruses. A candidate A/teal/HK/97 (H6N1) cold-adapted vaccine elicited the broadest cross-protective response, and this vaccine virus is currently undergoing evaluation in human clinical trials.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 101, "end": 106, "text": "[145]", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1343, "text": "[146]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "H6 Viruses and Vaccines"}, {"text": "The ability of a limited number of AI subtypes to replicate and cause disease in ferrets has been investigated, and not surprisingly, the behavior of H5 subtype viruses has been the most studied. Zitzow and colleagues [147] demonstrated that two H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from human cases of infection in Hong Kong in 1997 were capable of replication not only in the respiratory tract, but also in the brain, spleen and intestines of ferrets. Virus replication was associated with clinical signs of disease such as severe lethargy, sneezing, rhinitis, hind limb paresis and, in some cases, diarrhea, and some H5N1 viruses were lethal to ferrets. However, the hierarchy in the severity of disease seen with the different H5N1 1997 isolates upon infection of mice, was not observed in ferrets: influenza A/HK/483/97 and A/HK/ 486/97 were equally virulent after intranasal infection of ferrets, whereas the A/HK/ 483/97 virus was more virulent in mice than the A/HK/486/97 virus was in several studies [100] [101] [102] 148] . As with mice, the significance, with respect to humans, of disease signs and the extrapulmonary replication of H5N1 viruses in ferrets is not clear, particularly since, in the same study, Zitzow et al. reported the isolation of a human H3N2 influenza virus from the brain of ferrets following intranasal infection. Similar studies have been conducted using human and avian H5N1 viruses isolated in 2004-2005 [104, 149] . Govorkova et al. [149] evaluated four human H5N1 influenza isolates and nine avian H5N1 isolates from Asia from 2004. A wide spectrum of infectivity, severity of disease and lethality was observed in ferrets inoculated with these viruses. The H5N1 viruses isolated from humans and two of the avian isolates caused severe disease in ferrets with some lethality. However, it is difficult to draw general conclusions regarding the behavior of these viruses in this model because of the small numbers of animals used (only two animals per group for all but one of the viruses tested), and the variability in infectivity of the viruses examined. For example, although the influenza A/Vietnam/3046/2004 virus caused severe disease in two out of two the inoculated ferrets, it was lethal in only one animal, and virus was only recovered from the nasal washes. In contrast, the influenza A/Vietnam/3062/2004 virus, which was also lethal in one out of two ferrets inoculated, was recovered from the lungs, brain, spleen, and intestine of these animals. Similarly, Maines et al. [104] evaluated H5N1 isolates from Asia from 2004 using the ferret model. Although the viruses used in this study were different from those used by Govorkova et al. ( with the exception of A/Vietnam/ 1203/2004), similar findings were reported: the human isolates caused severe disease, with some lethality, in ferrets. Again, small numbers of animals were used (three per group for most of the isolates tested) and some variability in infectivity and severity of disease was observed. In the study conducted by Zitzow et al., gross pathological changes observed in ferrets infected with highly virulent HPAI H5N1 viruses included focal areas of redness in the lungs, consolidation of the lungs and rare discoloration of the liver, petechiae on the liver and lesions on the intestines and kidneys [147] . Maines et al. [104] reported the presence of hemorrhage in the adipose tissue surrounding the liver, kidney and bladder in two-thirds of infected ferrets. Histopathological findings in the lungs of infected ferrets included acute bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia with suppurative exudates in the bronchi, bronchioles and adjacent alveolar spaces, prominent epithelial necrosis and marked intraalveolar edema by day 3 p.i., and bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia observed on days 6-7 p.i. [104, 147, 149] . Inflammatory changes were also evident in the brain of ferrets infected with highly virulent HPAI H5N1 viruses at days 5-6 p.i., including in the glial nodules with perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the brain parenchyma, neuronophagia and lymphocytic infiltrates in the choroid plexus [147, 149] . Viral antigen was observed by immunohistochemistry in neurons in the same areas of the brain as the inflammation [104] . Govorkova et al. [149] reported histopathological changes in the liver, including diffuse vacuolization of the hepatocellular cytoplasm, mononuclear infiltrates, periportal hemorrhage, and hepatocellular necrosis.

The H5N2 cold-adapted vaccine has been evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in small numbers of volunteers [166] . The vaccine was evaluated at two different dose levels, and two doses were found to be safe and immunogenic in 47-55% of subjects.
