We hypothesize that sensitivity to Ang-2 might be related to biological effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. The case is suggestive of a potential role for synthetic Ang-2 for patients with COVID-19 and septic shock. Further studies are needed to confirm our observed clinical efficacy.",

Laboratory tests were notable for lymphopenia, leukocytosis, mildly increased creatinine, and markedly increased C-reactive protein and D-dimer (Table 1) . CT chest angiogram showed diffuse perihilar ground-glass interstitial opacities with consolidation at lung bases. A nasopharyngeal swab was sent for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN). The patient promptly received 30 mL/ kg of crystalloid resuscitation and guideline-concordant broad-spectrum antibiotics and was admitted to the ICU. He became hypotensive and required ABBREVIATIONS: ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme; ACE2 = angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Ang-2 = angiotensin II; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019; SARS-CoV = severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2 = 2019 novel coronavirus On ICU day 2, the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction result was positive. The infectious diseases team started hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The patient began neuromuscular blocker therapy for ventilator dyssynchrony and was placed in prone position to improve dorsal lung aeration. Throughout the day, his vasopressor requirements worsened severely. Transthoracic echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 61%, normal right ventricular systolic function, and an estimated right ventricular systolic e2 Novel Report pressure of 57 mm Hg. Noninvasive cardiac output monitor (FloTrac; Edwards Lifesciences Corp) showed severely reduced vascular resistance and high cardiac output. Although corticosteroids are not recommended for COVID-19, stress dose methylprednisolone was added for refractory septic shock. Ang-2 (10 ng/kg/min) was added as the third vasopressor. Soon after initiation of Ang-2 therapy, we observed considerable reduction in norepinephrine and vasopressin requirements (Fig 1) .",

His acute sensitivity to low-dose Ang-2 treatment allowed for rapid liberation from high-dose vasopressors. Although he received hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids before Ang-2, we would not expect these medications to have such marked hemodynamic effects.",

In ATHOS-3, 48.5% of patients (79 of 163) in the treatment group were able to have Ang-2 downtitration to # 5 ng/kg/min at 30 min. 5 This subgroup of patients had significantly lower endogenous serum Ang-2 levels, but unlike the present patient, they had lower baseline norepinephrine-equivalent requirements. The present patient had ARDS and was taking an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril). Severe ARDS has been shown to disrupt ACE function, 6 and an ACE inhibitor directly inhibits ACE activity. 7 These factors lead to endogenous Ang-2 insufficiency and were suspected to be related to Ang-2 sensitivity in prior studies. 8, 9 However, in ATHOS-3, no difference was observed in ARDS or exposure to ACE inhibitor between the different Ang-2 sensitivity subgroups. 5 Treatment with Ang-2 in COVID-19 may have special biological consideration. SARS-CoV-2 recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry. 10 ACE2 converts Ang-2 to heptapeptide angiotensin (1-7), counteracting ACE effects. 3 In vitro, Ang-2 has been shown to downregulate ACE2 expression. 11, 12 A recent paper promoted early use of Ang-2 for COVID-19-associated vasodilatory shock. 13 Chow et al 13 asked whether Ang-2 could cause downregulation of ACE2 in vivo and, subsequently, modulate cell entry and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2.",
