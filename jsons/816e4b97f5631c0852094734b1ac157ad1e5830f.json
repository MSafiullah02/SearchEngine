In order for decision makers to manage the viral spread of COVID-19 both in the intra-national and the international frontiers, it is essential to operate based on data-driven assessments. It's crucial to do so rapidly and frequently, since the nature of the viral spread grows exponentially and can burst worldwide again. A fast and accurate health status of individuals globally during a pandemic can save many lives and bring life back to a new normal. Herein, we present a data-driven tool to allow decision-makers to assess the spread of the virus among the world population. Our framework allows health agencies to maximize the throughput of COVID-19 tests among the world population by finding the best test pooling that fits the current SIR-D [1] status of the nation.",

Alternatively, we can allow lab managers to find the best pooling or nested-pooling strategy of samples in order to screen the whole population expeditiously using any type of binary test. For example, if the COVID-19 prevalence in the population of 1 million people is 1%, using our approach for the whole population with 3-nested pooling steps, only 100,000 (10% of unpooled tests) actual tests need to be done.",

Poolkeh is an online tool, which allows users to develop an optimal scheme to pool tests for an entire population. The optimal strategy developed will depend on the prevalence of the virus in the test population, and the sensitivity of the test (qPCR or NGS). Nested pooling of RNA samples and qPCR will not only stretch the supply of resources (reagents) but also increase the estimation of viral prevalence at each testing time point as a larger percentage of the population is tested. Antibody testing has yielded a prevalence of infection between 2 \u2212 30% of the population, but there may be pitfalls in the antibody tests and the population sampling [9] . A PCR approach with RNA pooling, however, can overcome some of the perils of relying on antibody test sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, viral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not the same as presence of IgG in an individual, and we still do not know whether the individual carries antibodies that neutralize and/or enhance viral infection for this virus. Although Real-time RT-PCR that uses individual amplification efficiencies for every PCR [10] is superior to the commonly used comparative C T (\u2206\u2206C T ) and the standard curve method, a distributive pooling strategy of each individual sample into multiple amplification wells can provide a means to score each well as positive or negative. The amplified DNA copy number variation and efficiency of each amplification become less important. As shown recently [11] , the prevalence of infection changes dramatically as actions by governments to isolate individuals that can spread the infection. Ideally, if time and resources allow it, a frequent population PCR-based tests [12] to obtain additional time points for viral infection prevalence would provide further insights into the potential number of tests necessary to update viral prevalence estimates. As the number of infections begins to drop and governments begin to impose less restrictive isolation measures to allow the normalization of economic and social activity, there needs to be an estimate of the number of tests required to determine that infection hot spots are not returning [13] . Incorporating daily data from an online nation-wide questionnaire [14] could also benefit the assessment of the prevalence. Regardless of how prevalence is computed, once available, Poolkeh finds the fastest nested test-pooling strategy without a lot of pipetting gymnastics. Moreover, Poolkeh isn't restricted to RT-PCR, rather it can work with any clinical-proven testing techniques [2, 14] . While we were working on the last part of our manuscript, a preprint of a study with an interesting and thematically related approach [4] to testing for SARS-CoV-2 was posted and came to our attention.",

Poolkeh will run on Heroku's credit in the next seven months, so labs around the world can optimize their pooling strategy for COVID-19 testing. We would like to express our sincere great hope for better and healthier times soon to come. Moreover, Y.E. thanks Professor Margaret S.
