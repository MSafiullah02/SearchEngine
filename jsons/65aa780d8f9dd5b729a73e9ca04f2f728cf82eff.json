Fear responses in both the uninfected and infected may reach psychopathological levels that require psychiatric interventions (Duan and Zhu, 2020) , and physicians and mental health professionals may have particularly high need for psychological support in the case of development of stress-related disorders (Chen et al., 2020 ). An area of key concern is the potential of the psychological context of the pandemic to exacerbate existing psychiatric conditions and influence the manifestation of their symptomatology. Here we report the case of a patient with schizophrenia presenting with COVD-19related delusions and hallucinations, illustrating the potential of COVID-19 to precipitate entry into a psychotic phase and impact symptom manifestation.",

His psychiatrist referred him after prescribing paliperidone depot Trevicta\u00ae (525 mg, dose increased from 350 mg). Admission to our hospital was deemed necessary because for approximately one week prior the patient had been hearing his neighbours' voices (both males and females) blaming him, as a former ambulanceman, for not taking sufficient care of his parents who could have died of a COVID-19. The voices also claimed that all of the neighbours could also have COVID-19 as a result of his negligence. Our patient recognized the voices as hallucinations which could be a sign of worsening of his paranoid psychosis, which had been first diagnosed in 2011. Nevertheless, obeying the voices he went to his parents' house in the middle of the night to check if they were alive, but ultimately decided not to enter the house. He also believed that he was being observed by cameras at his home and he personally expected to have immunity to COVID-19 after already being infected by a Chinese message through a WhatsApp group.",

The patient also reported that he no longer believed that his family and neighbours were infected, and this resulted in reductions of his anxiety and tension. The successful treatment of the COVID-19-related hallucinations leads us to speculate that a decline in paliperidone serum level towards the end of the three months treatment period may have contributed to the onset of the described symptoms.",

            "text": "This case report shows the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the psychopathology of a patient with paranoid psychosis leading to the outbreak of a psychotic phase with paranoid-hallucinatoric experiencing and unrealistic expectations and concerns. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of a COVID-19-related paranoid processing in a psychosis patient. It is reasonable to expect that media coverage of exceptional circumstances will influence the content of delusional thoughts, especially in crises like infectious disease pandemics or after assassinations. However, the number of studies addressing such issues is very limited; one such study carried out during the 2009 swine influenza pandemic indicated that patients with schizophrenia and a high level of predicted fear tended to judge their own risk of infection as higher (Maguire et al., 2019a ). An interesting aspect of the current case is that in a highly interconnected world, our patient assumed a Chinese WhatsApp message had infected him. Moreover, he was more concerned about others than himself, a manifestation possibly influenced by his former role as an ambulanceman. This observation may be in line with the previous reports that higher levels of concurrent anxiety in patients with schizophrenia correlated with lower perception of personal risk of infection with swine flu, although the reason for this effect is unclear (Maguire et al., 2019a) . Patients with schizophrenia have also been shown to be less willing to get vaccinated and to adhere to social distancing during an influenza pandemic (Maguire et al., 2019b) . Our patient reported trying to spend more time at home because of COVID-19, but did not adopt other protective measures such as hand washing or wearing a face mask.",
