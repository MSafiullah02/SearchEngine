            "text": "The stress system receives and integrates a diversity of cognitive, emotional, neurosensory, and peripheral somatic signals that are directed to the central nervous system through distinct pathways. The stress response is normally adaptive and time limited and improves the chances of the individual for survival. The stress response is mediated largely by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with the release of cortisol. In general, there is a graded cortisol response to the degree of stress, such as the type of surgery. Cortisol levels also correlate with the severity of injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale, and the APACHE score. Cortisol effects the transcription of thousands of genes in every cell of the body. In addition, the cortisol-glucocorticoid receptor complex effects cellular function by non-transcriptional mechanisms. Cortisol has several important physiological actions on metabolism, cardiovascular function, and the immune system. Cortisol increases the synthesis of catecholamines and catecholamine receptors, which are partially responsible for its positive inotropic effects. In addition, cortisol has potent anti-inflammatory actions including the reduction in number and function of various immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils at sites of inflammation. Cortisol is the most important inhibitor of the transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators (inhibits NF-\u03baB and AP-1 by multiple mechanisms). 1 There is increasing evidence that in many critically ill patients, activation of the HPA axis and the release of cortisol are impaired. The reported incidence varies widely (0-77%) depending upon the population of patients studied and the diagnostic criteria used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency (AI). 2 However, the overall incidence of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill medical patients approximates 10-20%, with an incidence as high as 60% in patients with septic shock. 2 The major sequela of adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill is on the systemic inflammatory response (excessive inflammation) and the cardiovascular function (hypotension).",

This complex syndrome is referred to as \"critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI).\" 1,3 CIRCI is defined as inadequate cellular corticosteroid activity for the severity of the patient's illness, i.e. CIRCI may be due to acute adrenal insufficiency, corticosteroid tissue resistance, or both. The mechanisms leading to dysfunction of the HPA axis and tissue glucocorticoid resistance during critical illness are complex and poorly understood. 1 CIRCI manifests with insufficient corticosteroid-mediated downregulation of inflammatory transcription factors.",

            "text": "The use of stress doses of corticosteroids (200-300 mg hydrocortisone/day) in critically ill ICU patients is controversial with little consensus in the literature. Hopefully, ongoing clinical trial will help resolve this issue. However, corticosteroids should be considered in the treatment of patients with septic shock who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressors (requiring >0.05-0.1 \u03bcg/kg/min of norepinephrine or equivalent) and patients with ARDS who show progressive disease after 48 h of supportive care. Adrenal testing is not required in these patients. Two recent meta-analyses support the use of low-dose (stress doses) corticosteroids in these patients with a very favorable risk/benefit profile. 5, 6 Additional ICU patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for CIRCI (as defined above) and who have hemodynamic instability or evidence of an excessive inflammatory response should also be treated with corticosteroids (liver failure, pancreatitis, etc.). Corticosteroids have also proven beneficial in patients with the HELLP syndrome (see Chapter 54) and in preventing atrial fibrillation (and limiting SIRS) in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. 1 The suggested treatment approach is outlined below. Corticosteroids should never be stopped abruptly; this will lead to a \"rebound\" of inflammatory mediators with an increased likelihood of hypotension and/or rebound inflammation (lung injury). A continuous infusion of glucocorticoid may be associated with better (smoother) glycemic control. 7 Since blood glucose variability has been demonstrated to have prognostic implications, 8, 9 a continuous infusion of a glucocorticoid may have additional benefits.",
