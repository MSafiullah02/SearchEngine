            "text": "There is no available vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and no drug with proven clinical efficacy, although there are several candidates that might be effective in prevention or treatment. Encouragingly, the response from the research community to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been vigorous. A review of clinical trial registries, as of March 24, 2020, identified 536 relevant registered clinical trials. 1 Of the 332 COVID-19 related clinical trials, 188 are open for recruitment and 146 trials are preparing to recruit. 1,2 The distribution of these clinical trials is centred in the countries most affected by COVID-19 in the past 2 months, particularly China and South Korea, with high-income countries in Europe and North America planning most of the forthcoming trials. Very few trials are planned in Africa, south and southeast Asia, and central and South America.",

The capacity of weak health-care systems to manage a surge of severe pneumonia is limited, and the low availability of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line health-care staff means that these key staff are likely to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Disruption or complete breakdown of those health-care systems would result in high direct and indirect mortality since care of all illness would be affected.",

            "text": "COVID-19 trials should be adequately powered to generate evidence. They need to be large and well designed. Priority should be given to interventions that reflect the specific needs of countries and are readily implementable. For resource-poor settings, that means interventions need to be affordable and available, and adaptable to the healthcare systems and the populations they serve. The adverse impacts of COVID-19 on health and welfare are likely to be considerable in low-income or middle-income countries (LMICs). Clinical trials, and evaluations of affordable and implementable interven tions of all types-behavioural, organisational, medical, and sup portive-are a priority. 4 On March 18, 2020, the Director-General of WHO announced the launch of the SOLIDARITY trial, an international study of potential treatments for COVID-19 to be conducted in Asia, South Africa, Europe, and the Americas. 5 WHO has an important convening role in setting COVID-19 research priorities, facilitating trials, and coordinating efforts. The WHO COVID-19 research and development blueprint 6 and the R&D Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group will provide guidance and ensure the necessary coordination and sharing of information. WHO will also have a central role in reviewing the evidence generated by trials and in producing guidelines. Yet despite these international efforts, there remain substantial organisational and bureaucratic obstacles to a rapid research response. Strong political support, effective collaboration, adequate expertise and resources, and informed guidance will be needed to overcome these barriers.",

            "text": "Managing COVID-19 will place considerable pressures on health-care systems. COVID-19 results in severe pneumonia and death in approximately 4-5% of patients admitted to hospital in well supported health-care settings. 3, 7 Evidence is needed on pre-expo sure prevention, post-exposure prevention, and patient management. Several countries are already recom mending chemoprevention or treatments for which there is no convincing evidence of benefit and banning export of these medicines, thereby compromising the trials needed to establish the evidence. It is possible that none of the current therapeutic interventions being trialled or recommended will prove beneficial. Large, well conducted clinical trials are needed urgently to support guidelines on prevention and clinical management. These trials must not detract from already overstretched health services and, with travel bans in many places, they must be designed to accommodate remote initiation and monitoring. There is also much that might be improved in supportive care and organisation in LMIC settings that could reduce direct and indirect COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Research is needed now to guide the increasingly difficult choices that resource-limited health-care systems will face. Yet additional challenges that relate to ethics review, regulation, manufacturing, clinical trial support and logistics, open science and data sharing, and equitable and affordable access will need to be overcome for these studies to be successful.",

Our objective is to use our existing research capabilities to support, promote, and accelerate multicentre trials of the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of interventions against COVID-19 in resource-limited settings. For therapeutics, research in such settings should focus primarily on evaluation of affordable repurposed medicines-ie, those already developed and approved for other indications-and implementable supportive measures. If applicable, testing of new diagnostic tools, org/covid-19/pipeline/ vaccines, and other potentially beneficial strategies will be added to the trials. Our objective is not to control the research agenda but to facilitate it. With partners, we have four goals. First, we aim to facilitate rapid and joint protocol reviews by ethics committees and national regulatory agencies, as was done for the Ebola vaccine trials. Second, we aim to facilitate approvals for the importation of study medications and materials through agreed coordinated fast-track mechanisms. Third, we aim to ensure standardised and simple collection of key data, sufficient for robust analysis of efficacy and safety of the tested interventions. Fourth, we aim to provide a governance framework to share outcomes before publication.",
