It can be due to a number of medications, but we now emphasize its association with hydroxychloroquine. This antimalarial drug commonly employed for a variety of rheumatic and dermatological disorders is now under evaluation as an antiviral agent against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019).22, 23 More than 20 cases of GPFE from hydroxychloroquine have been described in the medical literature.",

Pustular erythema may develop irregularly along active borders. Erythema may fade with scaling, including on the palms and soles. Some cutaneous sloughing and excoriations may also be observed with blisters or erosions occasionally noted. There may be little or no mucosal involvement. Skin biopsy specimens may initially show mainly the changes of urticaria, but evolve into subcorneal and/or intraepidermal neutrophilic pustules sometimes with mild focal acantholysis, exocytosis, spongiosis, and an edematous papillary dermis with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with occasional neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells progressing into a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate.
