A distinct coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain). The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS-CoV. This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.",

Recently, a distinct coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS [1] [2] [3] [4] . The spike proteins of this RNA virus associate with cellular receptors of sensitive cells to mediate infection of their target cells, after which viral replication begins in the cytoplasm. The main targets of SARS-CoV are the lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels, resulting in systemic vasculitis, decreased immune function, and respiratory distress caused by extensive pulmonary consolidation and diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation [5] : the latter causes death in 10% of infected individuals [6] .",

Human tissues from 15 different organs were obtained from patients undergoing biopsy procedures for diagnostic purposes or surgery for various reasons, predominantly for the treatment of cancer. Additional tissue was obtained from unused donor organs; these organs were unused for technical reasons (often in cases of unilateral transplantation with lack of an adequate acceptor for the other lung). Extensive specification of the diagnosis is given for the lung and small intestine only (see below). Brain tissue was obtained from autopsies. Tissues were chosen to represent organ systems where the SARS virus has been detected in humans [13] and in experimentally infected macaques [3] . Routine morphology was evaluated in haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections by a qualified pathologist. Tissues were only used if characterized as non-diseased. Tissues were investigated from 93 different subjects: lung (cancer n = 4, unused donor lung n = 5, alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency n = 1); skin (n = 6); oral mucosa (n = 4); nasal mucosa (n = 5); nasopharynx (n = 6), gastric cardia and corpus (n = 9); different parts of the small intestine: duodenum (cancer n = 2, ulcer n = 2), jejunum (chronic inflammation n = 1, atresia n = 1, cancer n = 1, resection of ileostoma n = 1), and ileum (resection of ileostoma n = 1, chronic inflammation n = 1, metastatic cancer n = 3, primary cancer n = 1, Hirschprung's disease n = 1, angiodysplasia n = 1); colon (n = 5); spleen (n = 4); thymus (n = 4); lymph nodes (n = 6); bone marrow (n = 5); liver (n = 6); kidney (n = 4); and brain (n = 3).",

Cytospin preparations from A549 cells were fixed in PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde (2%) at 4 \u2022 C for 10 min. Subsequently, they were dried and stained for ACE2. A polyclonal rabbit anti-ACE2 antiserum (Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA) [10] diluted in PBS and supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin was used at a concentration of 1 : 1000 for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected using sequential incubations with peroxidase-labelled goat anti-rabbit and peroxidaselabelled rabbit anti-goat antibodies (GARPO/RAGPO; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Human AB serum (1%) was added to the secondary antibodies. Peroxidase activity was developed by using 3,3 -diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB) for 10 min. Counterstaining was performed using Mayer's haematoxylin. Three types of control tests were performed to determine the specificity of the antibody. First, control sections were incubated with anti-ACE2 antibody solutions which had been pre-incubated with the synthetic peptide to which the antibody was raised (peptide sequence: NTNITEENVQNMNNAGDKW aa 51-69; Pepscan Systems BV, Lelystad, The Netherlands); second, sections were incubated with unrelated rabbit polyclonal antibodies (anti-alpha 1 inhibitor 3 or antinitrotyrosine); and third, sections were incubated with PBS without the primary antibodies.

The most remarkable finding is the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, ie cells in contact with the external environment. Furthermore, ACE2 is present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all of the organs studied. These data are consistent with previous findings that low levels of ACE2 mRNA are found in many tissues and that ACE2 mRNA is highly expressed in renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal tissues [8, 10, 12] . The physiological role of ACE2 in most tissues has not been elucidated, although ACE2 is thought to be an essential regulator of cardiac function and blood pressure control [9] , possibly by acting as a natural counterpart of ACE1 [14] . ACE2 has recently been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV [7] . Li et al showed that ACE2 can be immunoprecipitated by the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV virus and that ACE2 can promote viral replication. The demonstration of ACE2 expression in human organs can potentially identify the possible routes of infection for SARS-CoV, and possible routes of spread and replication throughout the body.",

Recent studies in an autopsy series using viral isolation, culture techniques, and in situ hybridization showed that SARS-CoV is present in pneumocytes [13] . Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of coronavirus-like particles and viral inclusion bodies in pneumocytes [5, 15, 16] . We found that type I and type II pneumocytes are markedly positive for ACE2 and that bronchial epithelial cells show only weak staining. The type II alveolar epithelial cell line A549 confirmed the presence of ACE2 protein in type II pneumocytes. These data, combined with the fact that ACE2 is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, indicate that alveolar pneumocytes in the lung are a possible site of entrance for SARS-CoV. Furthermore, this expression pattern provides a possible explanation for the pathological lung manifestations and their rapid progression. Initial viral entrance may cause cytopathological changes at the epithelial alveolo-capillary interface, initially resulting in induction of type II alveolar cells as a first attempt at repair. In SARS, the abundant expression of ACE2 in type II alveolar cells may cause a base for rapid Upper respiratory tract symptoms occur in a minority of SARS patients and SARS-CoV RNA can be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates [17] . However, tissues of the upper respiratory tract, such as oral and nasal mucosa and nasopharynx, did not show ACE2 expression on the surface of epithelial cells, suggesting that these tissues are not the primary site of entrance for SARS-CoV. The upper respiratory tract symptoms cannot be explained by our findings, but patients with SARS might be susceptible to secondary infections [18] . Moreover, SARS-CoV RNA detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates might be derived from the infected lower respiratory tract.",

This may imply that, by analogy with HIV infection, where the current general model of viral entry requires binding of the viral envelope not only to a cell surface receptor (CD4), but also to a chemokine co-receptor [CXCR4 or CCR5(BBA)] [23] , SARS-CoV also needs the presence of a coreceptor for cellular entry. Future studies have to elucidate whether SARS-CoV binding to a co-receptor in addition to ACE2 might be involved in the specific infection of lung and small intestine.",

This epithelial expression, together with its presence in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations, in particular in the lung. Whether the abundant expression in the vascular system may also serve as a route of spread and replication should be investigated further in functional studies applying blockade of the ACE2 protein.",
