Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is defined as an acute lung infection involving the alveoli that occurs in a patient without recent health care exposure.1 CAP encompasses a clinical spectrum from walking pneumonia in an otherwise healthy patient to necrotizing or multilobar disease with septic shock. Pneumonia is the third leading reason for hospital admission, accounting for 544,000 hospitalizations from the ED annually.2 Despite advances in medicine, the mortality rate from CAP has remained stable over the past 4 decades.3 In the United States, CAP is the leading cause of sepsis and death from infection.3 Given the prevalence of CAP and its potential to cause severe illness, emergency providers must have a thorough understanding of this multifaceted condition and be able to take a nuanced approach to management. Emergency physicians need to recognize symptoms suggestive of CAP, order appropriate diagnostic tests, select recommended empiric antibiotics, and risk stratify the patient for proper disposition. This article provides an overview of CAP in adults and touches on drug-resistant and health care-associated disease. Opportunistic lung infections, tuberculosis, and hospital-acquired pneumonia are beyond the scope of this review.",

The most common pathogen was rhinovirus, followed by influenza virus, then Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were the second and third most common bacterial pathogens, respectively.

            "text": "The categorization of pneumonia is evolving. Until recently, pneumonia was divided into 4 categories: CAP, health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are outside the scope of this article. HCAP is a category that includes patients who have been in regular contact with the health care system, including nursing home residents, patients undergoing home infusion therapy or wound care, dialysis patients, and patients hospitalized for 2 days or more in the prior 90 days.5 Such patients are thought to have a higher risk of pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, warranting broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, similar to hospital-acquired pneumonia. Common MDR pathogens include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), and gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae species. This topic is currently in flux because HCAP criteria are neither sensitive nor specific for identifying patients infected with MDR organisms. Treating these patients with the same regimen as for hospital-acquired pneumonia leads to overtreatment with broad spectrum antibiotics.6 Excess mortality in HCAP may be largely attributable to patient comorbidities rather than drug-resistant pathogens.6 The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society are removing the HCAP category from their guidelines.7 Forthcoming guidelines will recommend that the group formally known as HCAP be divided into 2 groups, those appropriate for limited spectrum therapy and those with 2 of 3 risk factors for MDR, who do require broad spectrum therapy.8\nTable 2\nlists risk factors for the most important MDR organisms. Although evidence on this topic remains incomplete and exact recommendations are not yet clear, it remains very important to identify ED patients who require broad spectrum empiric antibiotics.",

In the United States, influenza and pneumonia are listed together as the 9th leading cause of death.20 The highest rates are among elderly adults aged 65 to 79 years.4 Outcomes in patients requiring hospitalization for pneumonia are poor: the 30-day mortality is 10% to 12% and the readmission rate is 18%.1 Interestingly, mortality after a CAP hospitalization remains increased at 1 year and 5 years. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and liver disease have an increased incidence of CAP.21 Fortunately, the use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may be responsible for up to a 35% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia.22\n",

Patients who are not elderly, with normal vital signs and normal auscultatory examination, can generally be given a diagnosis of bronchitis and discharged home without antibiotics. If vital signs or examination are abnormal, or the patient is elderly, a chest radiograph should be obtained. If the film is normal, the correct diagnosis is usually bronchitis. Rarely, very early in the disease course, or in severely dehydrated patients, the chest radiographs will be normal in CAP, but this is an uncommon issue in ambulatory patients less than 65 years old. If the chest radiographs confirms the diagnosis of CAP, the next step is risk stratification (see Severity Assessment and Clinical Decision Rules). In many patients who are determined to be at low risk for mortality by a clinical decision rule, no further diagnostic testing is required before discharge. The only important remaining step in such patients is proper oral antibiotic selection (see Fig. 1).",

Mycoplasma typically produces reticulonodular opacities or patchy consolidations. Mycoplasma targets bronchial epithelium and, therefore, can cause bronchial wall thickening (peribronchial cuffing) in central bronchi like respiratory viruses. Similarly, Chlamydia pneumoniae classically shows patchy consolidations or reticular opacities. Viral pneumonitis/pneumonia can be radiographically indistinguishable from bacterial CAP, but ground glass opacities are the most common findings after a normal chest radiographs.

S pneumoniae urinary antigen tests remain positive for 3 days after initiating therapy.24 Local health department notification is required if Legionella is detected because this may indicate an outbreak.

The procalcitonin level may be helpful in distinguishing bacterial from viral infections, although the data are not consistent.3, 15 Procalcitonin may also serve as a marker of disease severity; if low or decreasing, it may allow for the deescalation or termination of antibiotics in the inpatient setting. In a metaanalysis of 14 randomized trials, the use of procalcitonin was associated with a decrease in the duration of antibiotic therapy from 8 to 4 days, without a change in mortality.34 Another metaanalysis showed lower mortality among critically ill patients who were allowed to have procalcitonin-guided cessation of antibiotics.35 Other biomarkers currently under investigation to differentiate viral from bacterial illness include C-reactive protein and cortisol.15 Although biomarkers may have a future role in risk-stratification of CAP in the ED setting, ED studies are limited at this time (Fig. 3\n).",

PSI class IV and V patients should be hospitalized, with class V usually requiring ICU admission. Class III patients may be appropriate for 23-hour observation, 1 or 2 doses of intravenous antibiotics, and hydration.38 Classes I and II patients can usually be safely managed as outpatients.

Children should be vaccinated against S pneumoniae and H influenza with PCV13 and HIB.45 All healthy adults over the age of 65 should receive vaccination against S pneumoniae. The PCV13 should be given to adults 65 and older who have not previously received a dose and the PPSV23 should be given at least 1 year later.62 This regimen is especially important for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in whom pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the likelihood of CAP (needed to treat = 21) and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.63 Influenza vaccines should be given yearly to all eligible patients. Finally, frequent hand washing should be encouraged to patients and providers alike, primarily to prevent spread of respiratory viruses.",
