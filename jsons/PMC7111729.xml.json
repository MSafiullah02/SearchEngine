In addition to the unsuitable influences from their surroundings, there is also the constant threat from predators and pathogens. To cope with a diversity of unfavorable conditions plants have undergone evolutionary adaptation such as the elaboration of sophisticated defense strategies and the synthesis of an impressive diversity of natural bioactive compounds, some of which are toxic (Maag et al., 2014). Among the different toxic compounds reported in plants is a large group of low molecular weight compounds, among which alkaloids, terpenoids, tannins and glycosides (Mith\u00f6fer and Boland, 2012). Although these small molecules do not have a primary function in plants they play an important role because of their toxicity to animals, arthropods as well as to bacteria and viruses (Cushnie et al., 2014, Mith\u00f6fer and Boland, 2012). Furthermore plants also synthesize an arsenal of proteins such as lectins and ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), that help the plant in its continuous battle for survival (Lannoo and Van Damme, 2014, Virgilio et al., 2010).",

Some well-known families of toxic proteins include lectins, ribosome-inactivating protein, protease inhibitors, \u03b1-amylase inhibitors, ureases, arcelins, antimicrobial peptides and pore-forming toxins. Most of these proteins tend to accumulate in the vulnerable parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative storage tissues. In fact, the first proteins classified as RIPs, arcelins, canatoxins and lectins all originated from seeds where these proteins are highly abundant (Carlini and Guimar\u00e3es, 1981, Olsnes, 2004, Osborn et al., 1988). Research on toxic plant proteins has resulted in numerous data, showing evidence that these noxious proteins are involved in plant defense against phytophagous predators and pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, nematodes, and insects (Carlini and Grossi-de-S\u00e1, 2002).",

Analysis of completed genome sequences and transcriptome data suggests that lectins are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom.

Although some lectins recognize and interact with monosaccharides such as mannose, glucose, galactose, fucose, most plant lectins preferentially bind to more complex oligosaccharides like N- and O-linked glycans (Ghazarian et al., 2011). The carbohydrate-binding site typically consists of five to six amino acids that bind the hydroxyls of the sugar residues mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The specific interaction between the lectin and the carbohydrate involves the formation of a network of hydrogen bonds and is often reinforced by a hydrophobic stacking of the pyranose ring of the sugar to the aromatic ring of aromatic residues (tyrosine, tryptophan or phenylalanine) located in the close vicinity of the carbohydrate binding site (del Carmen Fern\u00e1ndez-Alonso et al., 2012).",

The first carbohydrate-binding protein was discovered in 1888, when Peter Herman Stillmark discovered a toxic protein in the seeds of castor bean (Ricinus communis). In the beginning of lectin research, the research was focused on lectins from seeds and later storage organs, in particular because lectins in these tissues are abundant proteins and as a consequence were rather easy to purify with the biochemical methods available at that time. It turned out that the majority of these lectins can be categorized as hololectins, being composed only of protein domains with carbohydrate-binding activity. The availability of sequence information for different lectin domains and genome sequences for different species allowed the identification of proteins containing a well-defined lectin domain or carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) linked to other known or unknown protein domains. For example, the class of type-2 RIPs consists of chimeric proteins composed of an N-glycosidase domain linked to a lectin domain (see 2.3). In the last few years the group of chimeric lectins has been reported in many plant species. Therefore, a classification system based on the presence of particular CRDs within a sequence was introduced to cope with the increasing complexity within the whole group of plant lectins (Van Damme, 2014).",

They are typically abundant proteins in seeds and vegetative storage tissues (Van Damme et al., 1998a). Several of these lectins have been studied for their toxicity towards animals, insects, fungi and also viruses (Michiels et al., 2010, Peumans and Van Damme, 1995, Yamaji et al., 2012). Due to their abundance, subcellular localization as well as their toxicity, it is generally accepted that these lectins serve a role as storage proteins and could also function in plant defense whenever the plant is attacked by a pathogen or predator (Peumans and Van Damme, 1995).",

In contrast to the classical lectins, these proteins are generally present at very low concentrations but transcript levels are up-regulated in specific plant tissues in response to stresses such as drought, high salt, hormone treatment, pathogen attack, or insect herbivory (Van Damme, 2008). Most inducible lectins are localized in the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm of plant cells. It is hypothesized that these lectins play an important role in stress-related pathways as signaling molecules (Lannoo and Van Damme, 2010, Lannoo and Van Damme, 2014).",

Lectins from different sources have been described as antimicrobial proteins and are believed to be involved in the plant defense against bacteria, fungi and viruses (Peumans and Van Damme, 1995). Although plenty of lectins have been considered to have antimicrobial activities, little is known about the mode of action. Due to the existence of a cell wall in both bacteria and fungi, it is difficult to envisage a direct interaction between the lectin and the microbial membranes (Peumans and Van Damme, 1995). The lectin from Lathyrus ochrus seeds was reported to interact with components of the bacterial cell wall (Bourne et al., 1994). The antifungal activity of chitin-binding lectins has been speculated to be related to their binding with the cell wall chitin, resulting in disruption of cell wall polarity (Selitrennikoff, 2001).",

            "text": "A broad range of plant lectins has been tested against insects both by in vitro bioassays with artificial lectin-containing diets and in vivo experiments with transgenic plants overexpressing a lectin gene. It was shown that lectins can impose severe effects on insect fecundity, growth and development. In addition, lectins can alter insect feeding behavior as well as oviposition (Michiels et al., 2010). It is generally accepted that specific binding of lectins to particular carbohydrate structures in the insect body is essential for lectins to exert their toxicity. The best studied group of plant lectins is represented by the Galanthus nivalus agglutinin (GNA), a mannose-binding lectin, which is toxic to both hemipteran and lepidopteran insects. Feeding experiments with artificial diets and experiments with various transgenic plants have demonstrated the detrimental effects of GNA on different insects (Van Damme, 2008, Vandenborre et al., 2011a). GNA is toxic not only due to its binding to the insect gut epithelium, but can also penetrate the gut epithelium and reach the hemolymph and other tissues (Fitches et al., 2001). Since the discovery of GNA as an anti-insect protein the insecticidal activity of many mannose-binding lectins has been demonstrated. It is not surprising that especially lectins that recognize mannose structures are highly effective against insects since the glycome of insects is known to consist mainly of carbohydrate structures with terminal mannose residues (Van Damme, 2008, Vandenborre et al., 2011b). At present the exact binding sites of lectins within the insect body are still subject to further research. It is worthwhile to mention that inducible lectins can also be part of the plant defense. For instance, upon infestation with the Hessian fly wheat plants respond with the induced expression of Hessian fly-responsive proteins like Hfr-1, Hfr-2 and Hfr-3, each containing a specific lectin domain (Giovanini et al., 2007). Similarly, the Nicotiana tabacum lectin accumulates in response to chewing caterpillars (Spodoptera littoralis and Manduca sexta) and cell-content-feeding spider mites (Tetranychus urticae), while infestation with phloem-feeding herbivores such as aphids and whiteflies (Myzus nicotianae and Trialeurodes vaporariorum) did not affect lectin accumulation (Vandenborre et al., 2009a, Vandenborre et al., 2009b). Overexpression of the tobacco lectin in transgenic lines revealed a strong retardation of caterpillar development and thus confirmed the insecticidal properties of the lectin.",

The toxicity of lectins to animals can vary greatly, ranging from merely antinutritional properties to lethal effects. An important example of a highly toxic lectin is the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) from bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), which causes severe toxic effects. Overall the toxicity of lectins is mainly due to their binding to specific carbohydrate structures on the epithelial cells in the animal digestive tract. Binding of the lectins to these receptors may cause dramatic changes in the cellular morphology and metabolism of the stomach and/or the small intestine, and can activate a cascade of signals which alters the intermediary metabolism (Vasconcelos and Oliveira, 2004, Yamamoto et al., 2013).

Most RIPs display a rather broad N-glycosidase activity towards ribosomes from plants, bacteria, yeast and animals. Very often type-2 RIPs are more efficient for animal ribosomes (Peumans et al., 2001).

The mature ricin consists of the toxin A chain (RTA, 32 kDa) and the lectin B chain (RTB, 34 kDa) linked by a disulfide bond. Ricin is initially synthesized as a single chain precursor named preproricin, which contains the information for a 26-residue signal peptide and a 9-residue propeptide in front of the RTA sequence as well as a 12-residue linker between the RTA and RTB sequences. Because of the presence of a signal peptide preproricin is transported to the ER. During this translocation, the precursor protein undergoes several processing steps, including the cleavage of the signal peptide, the primary N-glycosylation of the protein and the formation of multiple intramolecular disulfide bonds, important for the tertiary folding of the protein. At this stage, the propeptides and linker peptides remain in the proricin polypeptide, which renders the RTA domain in an inactive state and therefore may protect the plants from any potential toxicity of the N-glycosidase domain (Lord and Spooner, 2011). Subsequently, the glycosylated proricin is translocated in vesicular carriers to the Golgi complex and eventually reaches the vacuole. During this process, the protein undergoes further modification of the glycans and the N-terminal propeptide and the linker peptide are removed by vacuolar processing enzymes, resulting in the fully active type-2 RIP (Lord, 1985, Lord and Harley, 1985).",

            "text": "Type-2 RIPs possess an efficient strategy to enter the target cells, which makes them potent toxins, being toxic in the picomolar range (Stirpe and Battelli, 2006). The internalization of type-2 RIPs has been reviewed recently (Puri et al., 2012). In brief, type-2 RIPs such as ricin bind to glycoconjugate receptors on the cell surface with their lectin B chain which facilitates the entry of the protein in the cell through an endocytic pathway. After being transported from the endosome to the Golgi apparatus, the RIPs arrive in the ER lumen by a retrograde transport. Eventually, the type-2 RIPs exert their enzymatic activity on ribosomes after being translocated to cytosol. The carbohydrate-binding domain of most type-2 RIPs exhibits specificity towards galactosylated carbohydrate structures though a few RIPs also specifically recognize sialic acid residues (Van Damme et al., 1996). Hence galactosylated glycoconjugates, either glycoproteins or glycolipids, are the most likely targets for interaction. Because of the carbohydrate-binding activity of the B chain type-2 RIPs are also considered as lectins, and thus can also be classified as a family of lectins. Although the classical RIPs such as ricin and abrin are very toxic proteins, a few type-2 RIPs such as ebulin 1 show little or no toxicity. The cytotoxicity of ebulin 1 for HeLa cells is much lower than that of ricin, with an IC50 value of 6 \u00d7 10\u22128\n M compared to 10\u221212\n M for ricin (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2014).",

The toxicity of type-1 RIPs is limited by their low ability to reach the ribosomes in the cytosol. However, these proteins can still be very toxic if they succeed to efficiently enter the target cells, e.g., after conjugation to a lectin or antibody. This strategy has been exploited to prepare immunotoxins, which serve as a tool in cancer therapy (Polito et al., 2011; see below).",

It is also present in senescent plants and plays a role in the reprogramming of translation in response to stress. Currently two models for the function of JIP60 in translational reprogramming exist: (i) when JIP60 is proteolytically processed, the released RIP domain can act as an N-glycosidase thereby irreversibly inhibiting protein translation. (ii) Without processing the JIP60 protein is supposed to act as a ribosome-dissociation factor. The released eIF4E domain was shown to initiate the translation of other mRNAs encoding jasmonate-induced proteins. JIP60 thus plays a crucial role in the stress response by reprogramming the translational machinery in stressed cells (Rustgi et al., 2014). Another stress inducible RIP is PIP2 from Phytolacca insularis for which transcript levels are upregulated after both methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid treatments (Song et al., 2000). Sugar beet leaves contain a virus-inducible RIP (Iglesias et al., 2005). Jiang et al. (2008) identified 31 genes encoding RIPs in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Expression analysis showed that these genes are upregulated when rice is subjected to abiotic stress such as cold or salt stress. Interestingly, transgenic rice plants overexpressing one of these genes (OSRIP18) were more tolerant to salt and drought stress (Jiang et al., 2012).",

Feeding experiments with artificial diets as well as with transgenic plants suggested the insecticidal activity of several RIPs, including both type-1 and type-2 RIPs (reviewed by Vargas and Carlini, 2014). Several RIPs, mostly of the type-1 type, have also been proven to act as antifungal agents, although with less activity compared to other antifungal proteins. For instance, transgenic plants expressing PAP (from Phytolacca americana), curcin 2 (from Jatropha curcas), dianthin (from Dianthus caryophyllus) all showed enhanced resistance to Rhizoctonia solani (Qin et al., 2005, Shah and Veluthambi, 2010, Wang et al., 1998). In vitro experiments comparing the antifungal properties and the N-glycosidase activity of a type-1 RIP from Mirabilis expansa, ricin and saporin demonstrated that their antifungal activity was not necessarily linked to the depurination activity on ribosomes (Park et al., 2002). Although the mechanism of insecticidal and antifungal activity of RIPs is largely unknown, these activities are believed to be an important part of the plant defense system.",

            "text": "Due to their potential applications in medicine, many studies have been undertaken to investigate the toxicity of RIPs towards animal viruses, among which human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) being the most important one. The replication of HIV can be inhibited by several RIPs, such as TCS (from Trichosanthes kirilowii), pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) and Momordica antiviral protein (MAP30). It was reported that a mutated form for PAP, which lost its ability to depurinate ribosomes, still inhibited HIV in tobacco plants (Tumer et al., 1997). Similarly, two TCS mutants, TCSC19aa and TCSKDEL still retained N-glycosidase activity after most of their anti-HIV-1 activities were removed by site-directed mutagenesis resulting in the addition of 19 amino acids or a KDEL signal sequence to the C-terminal sequence (Wang et al., 2003). All these results suggested that the antiviral activity of RIPs is independent from their N-glycosidase activity. It has been proposed that the antiviral activity of RIPs may also be due to the direct depurination of the viral RNA/DNA. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that incubation of purified PAP and HIV-1 genomic RNA or treatment of HIV-1 long terminal repeats DNA with TCS resulted in the removal of adenine (Rajamohan et al., 1999, Zhao et al., 2010). The anti-HIV activity of TCS might be related to its ability to enhance the capabilities of chemokines to stimulate chemotaxis and G protein activation through interaction with chemokine receptors, which play important roles in HIV infection (Zhao et al., 1999). Although the inhibitory effect of RIPs towards HIV has been studied extensively and led to phase I/II clinical trials, there are still some issues that need to be resolved (Kaur et al., 2011, Puri et al., 2012).",

All these protease inhibitors act similar to competitive inhibitors, which bind to the active site of the enzyme to form a complex with a very low dissociation constant (107\u20131014\n M at neutral pH). The inhibitor directly mimics the substrate of the enzyme and thus forms an inhibitor\u2013enzyme complex that cannot be dissociated by the normal enzyme mechanism, therefore efficiently blocking the active site and the protease activity of the enzyme (Lawrence and Koundal, 2002).

Transgenic plants that overexpress protease inhibitors have been constructed to increase plant resistance to pathogens, insects and nematodes (Duan et al., 1996, Senthilkumar et al., 2010, Vishnudasan et al., 2005). Although the idea of using plant protease inhibitors as a pest control agent has become very attractive, some problems are of concern. During the long history of co-evolution between plants and herbivores, insects have adopted different ways to cope with protease inhibitors, such as the overexpression of proteases to maintain normal levels of enzymatic activity, the induced expression of proteases insensitive to the ingested inhibitors and the up-regulation of enzymes that degrade the protease inhibitors (Schl\u00fcter et al., 2010). The overexpression of protease inhibitors in plants not only results in the inhibition of certain insect proteases but also triggers adaptation mechanisms in some insects to minimize the effect of the protease inhibitor on food digestion (Moon et al., 2004, Dunse et al., 2010b). The use of protease inhibitors may also affect non-target organisms in the agroecosystem. Accordingly it is necessary to develop protease inhibitors with strong inhibitory activity against specific herbivores. Protein engineering methods can be used to enhance the inhibitory potency as well as broaden the activity range to improve the overall efficiency of protease inhibitors (Schl\u00fcter et al., 2010). A biotechnological approach involving transgene stacking/pyramiding can be applied to enhance the efficacy of protease inhibitors. Using a combination of potato type I and II protease inhibitors in transgenic plants, Dunse et al. (2010a) succeeded in increasing the resistance of cotton against insect damage from Helicoverpa armigera in the lab as well as in the field. Although some problems remain to be solved, it can be concluded that plant protease inhibitors show great potential for applications in pathogen control (Lawrence and Koundal, 2002).",

Based on its sequence canatoxin is considered as an isoform of the jack bean major seed urease, retaining approximately 30% of the ureolytic activity for urease (EC 3.5.1.5) (Follmer et al., 2001). Canatoxin also interacts with complex glycoconjugates and behaves like a hemilectin: erythrocytes pre-treated with canatoxin can be agglutinated by antibodies specific to canatoxin (Carlini and Guimar\u00e3es, 1991).",

Toxic symptoms provoked by canatoxin include respiratory distress and tonic convulsions of spinal cord origin, ultimately leading to the death of the animal. The central nervous system was identified as one of the target organs for canatoxin and certain neurotransmitters can be released dose- and time-dependently after incubation with canatoxin (Carlini et al., 1984). According to experiments using sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, canatoxin was deemed to disrupt the Ca2+ transport by the Ca2+ ATPase, leading to an increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, which eventually triggers exocytosis (Alves et al., 1992). It is likely that lipoxygenase pathways are somehow involved in this toxicity process since all toxic effects provoked by canatoxin known so far can be inhibited by lipoxygenase inhibitors (Barja-Fidalgo et al., 1991). Furthermore, the hemilectin activity of canatoxin mentioned above, might play a critical role in its interaction with target cell surfaces and could explain its tissue-specific toxicity (Carlini and Guimar\u00e3es, 1991).",

Nymphs of the hemipteran cotton stainer bug Dysdercus peruvianus are more susceptible to canatoxin compared to adults due to the distinct pattern of enzymatic activities of cathepsin-like protease in midgut homogenates depending on their developmental stages (Staniscuaski et al., 2005). Upon digestion of the native canatoxin by cathepsin-like enzymes present in the insect digestive tract, a 10 kDa internal peptide named pepcanatox is released which accounts for the insecticidal activity of this protein (Ferreira-DaSilva et al., 2000). Later, it turned out that pepcanatox is responsible for both the insecticidal and antifungal activities of urease (Postal et al., 2012). To elucidate the mechanism of action, a recombinant peptide equivalent to pepcanatox, named jaburetox-2Ec was used. Irrespective of proteolytic release, Jaburetox-2Ec exhibited similar insecticidal activity towards insects with both cathepsin-based and trypsin-based digestion. Molecular modeling showed that jaburetox-2Ec forms a large, generally exposed \u03b2-hairpin structure, which shares similar features with some pore-forming toxins and some neurotoxins (Mulinari et al., 2007). Crystal structures for jackbean major seed urease confirmed that a 10 kDa region corresponding to Jaburetox-2Ec, consists of an alpha-helix, a long loop, another short helix and a \u03b2-hairpin motif (Balasubramanian and Ponnuraj, 2010). This 10 kDa peptide was reported to have a cation-selective pore-forming activity, which explained the mechanism of jack bean urease to permeabilize phospholipid membranes (Piovesan et al., 2014). Both the insecticidal and antifungal activities of urease rely on this ability for membrane permeabilization. Surprisingly, studies with different mutants of Jaburetox (a peptide modified from Jaburetox-2Ec) showed that the N-terminal portion of Jaburetox maintained the pore-forming activity similar to the full peptide, despite of the absence of the \u03b2-hairpin motif (Martinelli et al., 2014), indicating that it is mainly the helix structure rather than \u03b2-hairpin motif that is essential for the membrane permeabilizing activity of the peptide. Taking all these facts into consideration, Jaburetox probably possesses an action mechanism similar to that of some \u03b1-pore-forming toxins, which bind to and act upon membrane K+ channels (Brogden, 2005, Degiacomi et al., 2013).",

They proposed that the severe deleterious effects of arcelins on the gut of Z. subfasciatus might be due to the recognition and interaction of arcelin with glycoproteins and other membrane constituents along the digestive tract. However, according to Minney et al. (1990) arcelins are indigestible by the gut proteases of Z. subfasciutus and thus caused starvation of Z. subfasciatus larvae. It is very likely that both factors contribute to the toxicity of arcelin for Z. subfasciutus. With respect to the insecticidal activity of Arc-4 and Arc-8 to A. obtectus, their resistance to proteolysis might be the main reason for their toxicity (Zaugg et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Thionins are small cysteine-containing, usually basic proteins of approximately 5 kDa, found in a number of monocot and dicot plants (Bohlmann, 1999). They consist of 45\u201348 amino acids bound by three or four disulfide bonds and are highly basic. Thionins can be divided into two classes: \u03b1/\u03b2-thionins and \u03b3-thionins. All the \u03b1/\u03b2-thionins are highly homologous at the amino acid level and exhibit the same three-dimensional structure. They are classified into five different groups mainly based on their distribution in the plant kingdom (Bohlmann and Apel, 1991). Type I thionins are present in the endosperm of cereals (the family Poaceae). Type II thionins have been isolated from leaves and nuts of the parasitic plant Pyrularia pubera and from the leaves of barley Hordeum vulgare. Type III thionins have been extracted from leaves and stems of mistletoe species. Type IV thionins are found in seeds of Abyssinian cabbage (Crambe abyssinica). Type V thionins are truncated forms of regular thionins found in some cereals such as wheat. Unlike the \u03b1/\u03b2-thionins, the \u03b3-thionins show distinct three-dimensional structures and share more similarity with another family of peptides named defensins, which have been reported in plants, but also in insects and animals (Stec, 2006, Stotz et al., 2009).",

The wide range of toxicity suggests that the permeabilization of cells by thionins relies on some universal process rather than a specific cell surface receptor. According to Hughes et al. (2000) the universal toxicity of thionins is due to the formation of ion channels in the cell membrane by binding to the lipid surface itself. However, Richard et al. (2002) proposed that thionins can partially insert into the lipid membrane through an electrostatic interaction, which subsequently rigidifies the membrane and increases the fluidity at edges of the interfacial region. Further studies suggested that the formation of negatively charged patches of phospholipid molecules is promoted by the electrostatic interaction between thionins and individual phospholipid head groups. These patches of toxins increase membrane fluidity and withdraw phospholipids from the membrane by lowering the energy penalty for the phospholipid membrane separation, which leads to additional membrane instability and ultimately irreparable lysis (Stec et al., 2004). Despite all the evidence mentioned above, more experimental work is still needed to elucidate the detailed mode of action of thionins and decipher their biological role.",

Because most of these properties are poorly studied, only some of them will be discussed. Ever since the discovery of their anti-HIV activity in early screening studies, cyclotides have attracted lots of attention. Although several cyclotides show anti-HIV activity, the exact mode of action is still unclear. Current data suggest that cyclotides affect the binding and/or fusion of the virus to the target membrane of host cells (Ireland et al., 2008). However, cyclotides are not being considered as anti-HIV agents due to their low therapeutic index (i.e., the ratio of their therapeutic effects to toxic effects). Hemolytic activity has been tested with numerous cyclotides, indicating a very low potency with a median hemolytic dose higher than 10 \u03bcM (Craik, 2010).",

They are best characterized in bacteria, but they have also been identified in plants, fungi and animals (Bischofberger et al., 2012, Gilbert, 2002). Many pathogens produce pore-forming toxins to attack the host by forming holes in the target cell membrane. Pore-forming toxins usually undergo a conformational change and then assemble into an oligomeric structure, which would promote a spontaneous membrane insertion (Iacovache et al., 2010). Eventually the disruption of the membrane permeability barrier can lead to cell death (Parker and Feil, 2005). In recent years there have been several reviews about pore-forming toxins (Bischofberger et al., 2012, Iacovache et al., 2010, Leippe, 2014, Los et al., 2013, Ramarao and Sanchis, 2013).

Enterolobin is structurally similar to the plant cytolysin aerolysin and occurs as a dimer in solution (Bittencourt et al., 2003). Insect feeding experiments showed that enterolobin is toxic to larvae of the bruchid Callosobruchus maculatus, causing 70% mortality at a concentration of 0.01% and 100% mortality at 0.025%. In vitro proteolysis studies showed that Entrolobin is resistant to the digestion by larval gut enzymes of C. maculatus (Sousa et al., 1993). Enterolobin also induces inflammation upon injection in rats (Castro Faria Neto et al., 1991). Similar to other pore-forming toxins, the oligomerization of enterolobin is promoted by low pH and high ionic strength (Fontes et al., 1997).",

Further support for the involvement of Hfr-2 in interactions with insects came from experiments with fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi). Wheat infestation with both insects resulted in enhanced transcript levels for the Hfr-2 gene (Puthoff et al., 2005).

The general idea is \u2018to use a plant protein to solve a plant problem\u2019 which \u2013 in view of consumer acceptability is a better strategy compared to the use of non-plant proteins. On the long term co-expression of multiple genes should be used rather than the expression of a single gene with the idea to circumvent problems related to development of resistance (Dowd et al., 2012, Dunse et al., 2010b). Similarly synthetic genes comprising a combination of different toxins have been tested. For instance, Liu et al. (2015) applied a fusion protein consisting of a GNA lectin domain linked to AaIT, the insecticidal neurotoxin of the scorpion Androctonus australis venom and reported that transgenic tobacco and rice plants which overexpress this fusion protein show enhanced resistance to both chewing and sucking pests. As such these lectins can contribute to the development of integrated insect pest control strategies and provide a nice alternative to the use of classical chemical insecticides or the use of B. thuringiensis toxins that exhibit little toxicity against sap sucking insects. Similar strategies can be used to engineer plants with enhanced resistance to bacterial, viral and fungal diseases. The use of inducible or tissue specific promoters rather than constitutive promoters could also achieve a better and more sustainable protection of plants (Abdeen et al., 2005, Checker et al., 2012, Corrado et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Plant toxins, mainly RIPs, have been used to fabricate immunotoxins for therapeutic purpose. The idea of immunotoxins, also named targeted toxins, was brought up more than four decades ago, and intended to make an A-B toxin specifically targeting cancer cells (Kreitman, 2006). The strategy is to link a toxin to another molecule that can direct the toxin in a selective way towards the cells to be eliminated. So far, there is only one successful example, an engineered protein combining Interleukin-2 and Diphtheria toxin named denileukin diftitox (Ontak), which has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Duvic and Talpur, 2008). In recent years a wide variety of immunotoxins have been synthesized and tested against several malignancies in cell cultures, animal models and patients. A list including more than 450 RIP-based immunotoxins can be found in Gilabert-Oriol et al. (2014). Normally, type-1 RIPs or the A chain of type-2 RIPs are used to construct the targeted toxins. Whole type-2 RIPs can only be used after modification of the protein since their B chain will affect the specific delivery of the toxins (Becker and Benhar, 2012). The toxins can be fused to carriers such as monoclonal antibodies, lectins, hormones, growth factors using a chemical linkage. Alternatively, genetic engineering methods can be employed offering a more standardized composition of the resulting molecule (Stirpe, 2013). Experiments with the RIP-based toxins yielded promising results in vitro and in experimental animals (Fracasso et al., 2010). However, some adverse reactions like vascular leak syndrome and fatigue have been observed. The use of mutant RIPs could be an option to reduce these side effects (Smallshaw et al., 2003). Nevertheless, there are still some obstacles for the use of immunotoxins. For example, the immunotoxins are recognized as foreign proteins, and hence might trigger an immunological response preventing their repeated use. A possible way to reduce the immunogenicity of the proteins is to use human or humanized antibodies, make a PEGylated form or deplete the immunodominant epitopes of RIPs (Lorberboum-Galski, 2011, Meng et al., 2012). Other hurdles include the expensive production, protein instability and short biological half-life and insufficient endosomal escape, which hopefully can be solved in the future (Gilabert-Oriol et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The traditional Chinese medicine makes use of Trichosanthin (TCS), a RIP from T. kirilowii, to induce abortion and to treat hydatidiform moles (Ng et al., 1992). TCS was also the first RIP for which anti-HIV activity was demonstrated in vitro. The inhibitory effect of RIPs on HIV proliferation in cells led to phase I/II clinical trials with TCS, and modified PAP was tested on AIDS patients (Puri et al., 2012). Although there is no success so far, the clinical trials showed the potential of TCS and PAP for treating HIV positive patients. Besides RIPs, lectins, especially some mannose-binding lectins, have also been shown to possess anti-HIV activity. These carbohydrate-binding agents can inhibit HIV infection of susceptible cells, but can also inhibit syncytia formation between persistently HIV-infected cells and uninfected lymphocytes. The lectins presumably act through binding with the glycans present on the HIV envelope, e.g. on gp120. Furthermore long-term exposure of HIV to lectins results in the progressive deletion of N-glycans on the viral surface in an attempt of the virus to escape drug pressure. Thus lectin treatment of HIV may form the basis for a novel chemotherapeutic concept relying on (1) the direct antiviral activity of lectins by preventing virus entry and transmission to target cells, and (2) an indirect antiviral activity of lectins by forcing the virus to change the glycosylation of the viral surface proteins. Eventually this novel strategy to combat HIV might also be extended to other enveloped viruses such influenza virus and coronavirus (Fran\u00e7ois and Balzarini, 2012).",

Therefore these cell surface glycoconjugates can serve as binding sites for lectins. More information can be found in a review by Bies et al. (2004).",

It is extremely important to obtain a detailed understanding of the protein structure and diversity, and their biological activities, since this knowledge is a prerequisite for biotechnological applications of these proteins. In addition, understanding how plants defend themselves is essential to preserve the food supply and develop disease-resistant crops. Throughout evolution plants have built up a first line of defense including constitutive as well as inducible defense mechanisms, consisting of an array of structural barriers, chemical compounds and toxic defense proteins. Although there is a large diversity in the types of proteins and their biological activities some of them are clearly evolutionary related. For example, sequence data proof the evolutionary relationships between legume lectins and arcelins. The same holds true for the ricin-related lectins and the RIPs that in addition to the lectin domain have acquired a domain with enzymatic activity. Ureases share some structural features with certain pore-forming toxins. Although these proteins also resemble each other with respect to their working mechanism there is a huge difference in the size of these proteins, ranging from small peptide proteins such as the antimicrobial peptides to high molecular weight multimeric structures as in the case of the pore-forming toxins. Irrespective of their sizes, small peptides like cyclotides can possess a similar pore-forming activity as the high molecular weight pore-forming toxins. Interestingly, several types of toxic proteins co-exist within the same plant species and can act together. This defense network of plants gets solidified not only by different plant toxic proteins that reinforce each other but also with low molecular weight chemicals such as terpenoids, phenolics, and alkaloids. Additionally, there is also a large group of non-toxic proteins such as hydrolytic enzymes, chitinases, defensins that are produced for defense purposes, and can support the action of those proteins with intrinsic toxicity. Although some toxic proteins clearly differ in their molecular structure and three-dimensional conformation they resemble each other in their mode of action. For instance, thionins, cyclotides and pore-forming toxins are active at the level of the membrane and both rely on the disruption of the membrane to execute their toxic activity.",

            "text": "Research of toxic plant proteins has attracted much interest mainly because of the potential applications in agriculture and medicine. Although a lot of progress has been made in our understanding of the biological activity of toxic proteins there are still a few important questions that remain. First, what is the distribution of toxic proteins? The availability of more completed sequences for different plant genomes will help to solve this question. Second, what is the physiological role of toxic proteins for plants? Although it is believed that toxic proteins are critical for plant defense, more efforts are required to understand the whole story. Finally, how could we benefit from our knowledge on toxic proteins and make use of these toxic proteins? A better understanding of the mode of action for each group of toxic proteins will facilitate manipulating and improving the use of these compounds, as part of a better strategy for the applications of plant toxic proteins. With respect to the use of toxic plant proteins for biomedical applications such as the use of proteins as therapeutic drugs some issues still remain and will require major consideration. But efforts are under way to improve the proteins and the available technologies to deliver them to specific locations in the organism or the cells.",
