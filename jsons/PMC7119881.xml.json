Turkey coronaviral enteritis is the most costly disease of turkeys encountered in Minnesota between 1951 and 1971. Coronavirus-associated outbreaks of poult enteritis remained as a major concern in the turkey industry. The clinical signs usually appear at 7\u201328 days of age and include inappetence, wet droppings, ruffled feathers, decreased weight gain, growth depression, and uneven flock growth. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccination available to control and prevent this disease. Rapid diagnosis and monitoring of immune status of a flock is critical for controlling outbreaks.",

The IFA procedures need antigen prepared from infected tissues, highly trained personnel, and expensive equipment. When the test is applied to evaluate large number of clinical samples, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Development of an antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for rapid diagnosis and effective control of turkey coronaviral enteritis is essential. However, large amount of highly purified viral antigen for coating ELISA plate requires propagation of TCoV in cell culture, which is not available at the present time. Alternatively, molecular cloning and expression of major structural proteins of TCoV was carried out for preparation of large quantities of highly purified viral proteins.",

The N protein is abundantly produced in coronavirus-infected cells and is highly immunogenic. The N protein binds to the viral genomic RNA and composes the structural feature of helical nucleocapsid. The complete sequence of TCoV N gene was recently obtained in this laboratory (Akin et al., 2001). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of TCoV N gene shared high (>90%) similarity with those of infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) N gene (Boursnell et al., 1987).",

The nucleocapsid proteins of various RNA viruses, such as mumps, rabies, vesicular stomatitis, measles, Newcastle disease, and IBV viruses, have been used as coating antigens in diagnostic ELISA (Linde et al., 1987, Reid-Sanden et al., 1990, Hummel et al., 1992, Ahmad et al., 1993, Errington et al., 1995, Ndifuna et al., 1998). The N protein gene of TCoV had been expressed in baculovirus system recently (Breslin et al., 2001). A complicate and competitive ELISA was demonstrated with this baculovirus-expressed N protein (Guy et al., 2002). However, the expression level of the cell culture-based baculovirus system is usually lower than that of prokaryotic system and the purity of this recombinant N protein was not clear. It is cheaper and more convenient to prepare large amount of pure recombinant protein in prokaryotic system. In addition, the antigenic integrity of N protein expressed in prokaryotic system is expected to be maintained because it is not glycosylated. The complete sequence of TCoV S and M genes has not been reported. The purpose of the present study was to express TCoV N gene with a prokaryotic expression system for preparation of large quantities of highly purified viral protein, which can be used as coating antigen for development of Ab-capture ELISA for serologic diagnosis of TCoV infection.",

Turkey coronavirus N protein gene was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with these two primers NF and NR. The amplified product containing the entire open reading frame (1,230 bp) was digested with Nco I and Kpn I and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The digested TCoV N gene fragment was purified and cloned to Nco I and Kpn I sites of plasmid pTriEx-1 (Novagen, Madison, WI). The pTriEx expression system allows the expression of recombinant N protein with a six histidine-tagged sequence on the C-terminal end. The construct was transformed to competent Escherichia coli strain Origami (DE3)pLacI (Novagen). Transformants were grown in LB medium containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin, 34 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1% glucose.

The size of N protein gene of TCoV and IBV is the same at 1,230 nucleotides. The molecular mass of N protein of TCoV and IBV is expected to be similar or the same on the basis of sequence information. The predicted molecular mass of the expressed fusion N protein of TCoV was therefore from 54.3 to 57.3 kd. It was reported that two proteins with molecular mass at 52 and 43 kd were produced in the expression of TCoV N gene from baculovirus system (Breslin et al., 2001). The difference of molecular mass between this 52 kd protein from baculovirus expression and the fusion protein expressed from prokaryotic system in the present study is mainly caused by the histidine tag.

However, an antibody-capture ELISA using TCoV antigens, instead of IBV antigens, should still be pursued in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Development of such ELISA system depends on readily available preparations of pure antigens. The recombinant N protein of TCoV as prepared in the present study was reactive with antibody to TCoV, suggesting intact antigenic integrity, and could be prepared inexpensively in large quantity. A preliminary ELISA method using the recombinant N protein as coating antigen could well differentiate the positive control serum from normal turkey serum.
