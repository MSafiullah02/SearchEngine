Bioinformatic analyses on viruses include the identification of open reading frames, gene prediction, homology searching, sequence alignment, and motif and epitope recognition. The predictions of features such as transmembrane domains, glycosylation sites, and protein secondary and tertiary structure are important for analyzing the structure-function relationship of proteins encoded in viral genomes.
