Since the pioneering epidemiology in the 1850\u2019s, whereby the English physician John Snow established that cholera was waterborne (Paneth et al., 1998), we have amassed a sound understanding of the transmission of various pathogens that cause diarrhoea and other diseases via drinking water (Hunter et al., 2002). Furthermore, the efficacy of drinking water treatment (traditionally by filtration and chlorination) to remove the bacterial pathogens responsible for cholera (Vibrio cholerae) and typhoid fevers (Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi), is well indexed by the common faecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is excreted in the faeces of all warm-blooded animals and some reptiles (Edberg et al., 2000, Enriquez et al., 2001).",

Yet the drinking water associated outbreak of cholera in Germany during 1892 was the foundation point of our modern understanding of waterborne pathogens. It was shown that residents of Hamburg suffered a very high mortality due to cholera, whilst people in neighbouring Altona served by the same-source water as in Hamburg, but a treatment by slow-sand filtration, helped them to escape the worst ravages of the outbreak. The German microbiologist, Robert Koch first isolated and described the causative agent, which he named Vibrio comma (later renamed to V. cholerae). This lead to sand filtration and taking John Snow\u2019s demonstration (1845) of the efficacy of chlorine disinfection, both became the norm from 1897 for the treatment of piped water in the then developing regions of Europe, United Kingdom and North America. These late nineteenth century innovations resulted in the largest reduction in global disease burden of any intervention since. Similar improvements have been sought in various developing regions of the world, many of which have been reported by Saunders and Warford (1976) and subsequent World Bank funded developments.",

Nonetheless, there are specific insights. In a random sample of 2355 Filipino infants over the first year of life, it has been suggested that improving drinking water quality would have no effect in the neighbourhoods with very poor environmental sanitation; yet in areas with better community sanitation, reducing the concentration of thermo-tolerant (faecal) coliforms by two orders of magnitude would lead to a 40% reduction in diarrhoea (Vanderslice and Briscoe, 1995).

A factor not often considered results from the higher concentrations of pathogens in sewage from developing regions (discussed above); in that WHO guidelines based on the same level of E. coli (assuming the majority come from human excreta) will represent significantly higher risk in developing regions versus the developed regions.

The disease is characterised by devastating watery diarrhoea which leads to rapid dehydration and death occurs in 50\u201370% of untreated patients (Faruque et al., 1998). Cholera toxin (CT), which is responsible for the profuse diarrhoea, is encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage designated CTX Phi, which probably results in a continual emergence of new epidemic clones. Hence, the ecosystem comprising V. cholerae, CTX Phi in the aquatic environment and the mammalian host offers a complex relationship between pathogenesis and the natural selection of a pathogen (Faruque et al., 1998), wherever there continues to be a lack of adequate water filtration and/or disinfection (Table 3\n).",

Hence, along with Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia these protozoa seem to be endemic to developing regions. Studies in a peri-urban shanty town in Lima, Peru, suggest that Giardia lamblia is hyperendemic in children (<10 years old) and despite treatment, 98% of the children became re-infected with Giardia lamblia within 6 months (and excreted for a mean of 3.2 months). Hence, treatment of all symptomless Giardia lamblia infections in a developing country hyperendemic for the disease is of questionable value because of rapid re-infection (Gilman et al., 1988).",

The eggs of the worm are found in soil contaminated by human faeces or in uncooked food contaminated by soil containing eggs of the worm. Ascariasis occurs with greatest frequency in tropical and subtropical regions and in any areas with inadequate sanitation. While a major cause of morbidity and mortality (up to 10% of the population of the developing world is infected with intestinal worms \u2013 a large percentage of which is caused by Ascaris; and world-wide severe Ascaris infections cause approximately 60 000 deaths per year, mainly in children [Kindhauser, 2003]) it is largely a disease of people exposed to untreated wastewater or food grown on it. The 85 000 hectares in the Mezquital Valley of central Mexico is a classic example where raw sewage is used to irrigated food crops and causes significant diarrhoea and Ascariasis (Cifuentes et al., 1993). WHO have long recognised the importance of wastewater associated Ascariasis and set a guideline of <1 ova per litre (in 1989), which is likely to remain in future guidelines (Blumenthal and Peasey, 2002).",

There are, however, several emerging waterborne issues. Foremost is the rapid urbanisation of humans in developing regions and the further stress that places on inadequate water supply and sanitation. Associated with increased human activity is the eutrophication of waterways and the resultant increases in diseases. For example, cholera outbreaks are well known to be associated with phytoplankton blooms in nutrient-rich coastal waters. Climate change too is now seen as a reality, with not only a change in the distribution of rainfall, but one also of greater extremes in global weather patterns. Major waterborne outbreaks typically follow large storm events in developing regions. Yet perhaps the greatest threat of all lies with the nature of microbial evolution, significantly increases with high density living and close association with animals. SARS has been a recent messenger to remind us of the significance small genetic changes can have in what was regarded as a relatively benign Coronavirus (Kuiken et al., 2003). Not only do we have to contend with continual evolution of new pathogens, but decline of the ozone layer also has microbial health implications. For example, various diseases have been shown to increase due to UV light suppression of human defence systems (Norval, 2003). In conclusion, despite our efforts, pathogens will always be a major issue for human health, and particularly so in developing regions.",
