Preliminary pathology studies of COVID-19 patients demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with edema, hyaline membranes, and inflammation, followed by type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, features characteristic of typical ARDS (8, 9) . But many patients with COVID-19related severe respiratory distress have a delayed onset of respiratory distress (10) , then manifest relatively well-preserved lung mechanics, despite the severity of hypoxemia, characterized by high respiratory compliance and high shunt fraction, and prolonged requirement for mechanical ventilation (10, 11) . Therefore, significant aspects of the pathology of COVID-19 might be expected to differ from classic ARDS.",

Co-localization of SARS-CoV-2-specific spike glycoproteins with complement components in the lung and skin was also documented. Our studies suggest that at least a subset of severe COVID-19 infection involves a catastrophic, complement-mediated thrombotic microvascular injury syndrome with sustained activation of the AP and LP cascades. Potential mechanisms of complement activation, including involvement of positive feedback loops with the coagulation system, are discussed in the context of hypothesis-generating studies providing the foundation for potential therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "infection of C3 -/mice led to significantly less weight loss and respiratory dysfunction than seen in wild-type mice, and this occurred despite equivalent viral loads in the lung (7). Another feature reflective of a prominence of complement-mediated pathology rather than simply inflammation or vasculitis in our COVID-19 patients was the extent of septal and intra-alveolar neutrophilia. It was present, but pauci-inflammatory. SARS-CoV-infected wild-type mice also had higher levels of neutrophils in the lung than their C3 -/counterparts (7). Tissue neutrophilia may be attributable to the neutrophil chemoattractant properties of complement. Both neutrophils and complement are key sentinels of innate immunity and also modulate thrombogenic pathways, the latter thought related to C5a receptor/tissue factor cross-talk mediated by neutrophils (24) . Neutrophilia in human SARS-CoV patients is associated with a poor outcome and could be an index of the extent of complement activation (7, 25) . Peripheral neutrophilia is not a significant observation in limited series of COVID-19 patients from China (26) There may also be pathways apart from virus spike engagement by which LP and AP are activated. First, MBL and ficolins bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns present on injured cells, enabling complex formation with MASP2 (36) . In addition, all three ARDS-linked coronaviruses use ACE2 as an entry point to cells (6) . Angiotensin I and angiotensin II have been associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, and ACE2 is involved in their deactivation (37) . If overwhelming coronavirus infection, with binding to ACE2 on epithelial targets not only in the lung but in other tissues expressing these proteins, including the kidney, intestines, and brain, were to interfere with ACE2 activity, the resulting increases in angiotensin II could lead to reactive oxygen species formation and interference with anti-oxidant and vasodilatory signals such as NOX2 and eNOS, with further complement activation. This has been demonstrated in a rat model of angiotensin II over-expression linked to other disorders (38) .",

The inter-alveolar septa were congested, with luminal and mural fibrin deposition within septal capillaries. Focal intraalveolar collections of neutrophils and monocytes were seen. Viral cytopathic changes were not appreciated. Due to vascular compromise, there was concomitant striking red cell extravasation found within the alveolar spaces, along with intra-alveolar fibrin deposition.

We have observed an increase in peripheral blood neutrophil vacuolization and granule content in our patients, consistent with an activated state, even if absolute numbers are not elevated.Systemic activation of complement was reflected by elevated complement levels in the sera of SARS-CoV-infected wild-type mice. We measured complement levels in only one of our cases, Case 3. They were only moderately elevated, perhaps reflecting consumption in tissues, with reciprocal depression of circulating levels. Indeed, we found deposition of AP and LP components in normal-appearing skin in 3 cases, not only in biopsies of retiform cutaneous lesions from those patients. Retiform purpura reflects the cutaneous manifestation of an occlusive microthrombotic process(28). In summary, while complement does not appear to play a major role in controlling CoV replication, it may have a critical role in its pathogenicity.There are several intriguing questions that remain to be addressed as additional cases are investigated. For example, one might have anticipated thrombocytopenia in the context of a systemic microvascular thrombosis in our cases. Although mild thrombocytopenia (100-150 x histologically. It is possible that infection-related thrombocytosis was mitigated by the development of severe vasculopathy. However, there is also precedent for such platelet values in an atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS)-type of microangiopathy. Platelet counts may be in the normal range despite severe thrombotic disease(29). Second, there appears to have been a delay of 5-9 days in most, if not all, of our patients between the onset of typical respiratory symptoms, including a non-productive cough, myalgias, fatigue, fever, and mild dyspnea, and a catastrophic change in respiratory status. This may reflect an evolution of immune processesanti-viral IgM levels would expect to emerge at this point-or perhaps the fact that the complement cascade is a threshold pathway. When activated to a great extent it may exceed the capacity of complement regulatory proteins, both soluble and normally present in abundance on the microvasculature(29). That raises the issue of why only a subset of SARS-CoV2-infected patients develops such severe disease with features atypical for ARDS. The age range was wide among our cases, as was the degree of pre-existing immune suppression. But there are a variety of complement regulatory factor polymorphisms or mutations (21) as well as coagulation pathway mutations which could promote susceptibility to enhanced complement activation and thrombosis in a given individual that should be investigated.Our results, particularly when viewed in the context of murine models of SARS-CoV infection, suggest the hypothesis that intervention with inhibitors of the alternative or lectin complement pathways, or both, may be relevant to severe COVID-19 in humans. Multiple studies have documented a role for the AP in microvascular injury(30), as characterized by C5b-9 deposition(13,31), but the lectin pathway has not been similarly investigated. Support for the involvement of the LP in COVID-19 comes from the discovery that MBL binds to the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein(32). A complex of MBL with MASP-2 is the first step in LP activation, and part of a positive feedback loop leading to sustained AP activation, with inflammation and concurrent activation of the coagulation cascade(33,34). Although documented experimentally for SARS-CoV, this binding is speculative in terms of SARS-CoV-2, as certain sites on its glycoprotein spikes are mutated compared to SARS-CoV(35). However, glycosylation sites for high-mannose structures with the potential to similarly engage MBL, and thus activate MASP2, have been identified for SARS-CoV-2(35). Our data showing co-localization of products linked to activation of the AP (C5b-9) and LP (C4d) with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins are consistent with this hypothesis.",

Investigating critical biomarkers consistent with complement-mediated microvascular injury and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients would be important. A panel to study might include: d-dimers; factor VIII, fibrinogen, and other coagulation factors; antiphospholipid antibodies; C-reactive protein; pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-1 and IL-6; circulating complement proteins including C3, C4, C5b-9, and Bb (the latter remaining in circulation longer than other components, as a marker of AP activation); and tissue biopsy, the skin being most readily accessible. This could enable establishment of criteria for clinical trials with ant-complement and/or anticoagulants, and perhaps open the possibility for earlier intervention than at the end-stages of severe COVID-19.",
