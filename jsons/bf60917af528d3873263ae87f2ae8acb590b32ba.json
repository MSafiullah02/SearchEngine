These systems are typically set up to collect data on the occurrence of diseases in humans and/or animals, thereby enabling identification of outbreaks, tracking the spread of diseases and providing early warning for national as well as international human and animal health institutions. Food Safety surveillance systems are focused on either food contamination, typically referred to as food monitoring, or foodborne disease surveillance. Recent experience has shown that these traditional systems are not always effective nor timely in relation to alerting officials to newly emerging foodborne or zoonotic diseases: diseases transmitted between animals and humans [3] . Examples include HIV/AIDS, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) such as H5N1 and H1N1 (pandemic) AI virus. Zoonotic disease outbreaks seem to be increasing in number.

They are zoonotic diseases which have been eradicated (or drastically reduced) in affluent economies through vaccination, culling policies, and/or introduction of better animal management practices.

Outbreaks of viral diseases in humans, originating in or spreading through farm animals (avian fluinfluenza A (H5N1) and swine fluinfluenza A(H1N1)) have caused major global alerts in the last decades. These influenza outbreaks spread very quickly, either in the animal population (H5N1) or directly in the human population (H1N1), and formed a global threat for human health. H1N1 was therefore characterized by the WHO as a pandemic. Although, in total the human disease burden related to the endemic bacterial zoonoses is probably many fold higher than these influenza outbreaks, it is basically these relatively few but fast spreading outbreaks that have put One Health on the global agenda. In addition, the failure to predict, monitor and control the spread of these diseases in animals presented regulators and politicians with a wake-up call, and made them demand (better) cross-sectoral collaboration between the animal and human health sectors [5] . Avian influenza (AI), caused by the influenza A virus, is one of several zoonotic influenza diseases. Although WHO for some timeand maybe under pressure from major pork producersmaintained that swine influenza should not be characterized as such, most scientists (including WHO) now refer to these influenza types as per their 'natural' host. Humans can be infected with avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza viruses, such as avian influenza virus subtypes A(H5N1), A(H7N9), and A (H9N2) and swine influenza virus subtypes A(H1N1), A(H1N2) and A(H3N2). The majority of human cases of avian influenza A virus infections have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry. Controlling the disease in the animal source is critical to decrease risk to humans. Zoonotic influenza infection in humans will continue to occur, notably from avian and other animal sources.

This QMRA model was developed to estimate the prevalence of infection and contamination and the microbial load from the farm to the point of consumption (exposure) and then estimating the probability of infection. It was also used to investigate the effect of interventions to control Salmonella in pigs at different points of the food chain and resulted in a hierarchy of suggested on-farm and slaughterhouse control measures, with estimates of the reduction of human cases they would result in [29] . To model the effect of interventions from farm to fork on the incidence of human campylobacteriosis, a QMRA model was developed for Campylobacter in broiler meat.

These pathogens can also be easily spread globally via the food chain due to global trading of animals and food products and international travel and movement of humans [71] . In order to improve food safety management of these bacteria in the global food chain through a \"One Health\" approach, the world needs surveillance and response systems that are capable of detecting them rapidly, understanding them and responding to them [72] . The \"One Health\" integrated approach involves \"the collaboration of multiple disciplines, sectors and multiple groups working locally, nationally and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment\" [73] .

The Sanger method was used to sequence the first bacterial genome, Haemophilus influenza in 1995 [88] and other bacterial genomes over the next few years [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] . In 2005, the NGS (\"second generation\" technology or massively parallel sequencing) era began and this high throughout technology allows short sequencing reads (50-400 bp), subsequently long sequencing reads (1000-100,000 bp) to be generated and detected in a single machine run, without the need for cloning. The short read technologies, such as those employed by platforms that are provided by Illumina (e.g. MiSeq, NextSeq and HiSeq 2500) and Life Technologies (e.g. Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine) produce read lengths ranged from~100 to~600 bp with low per-base error rate (usually less than 1%) [94] . They are routinely used for assembly of good quality draft bacterial genomes that contain multiple contigs 2 (can be up to 100 of them), and are of good coverage (>95%) and high accuracy.

This is in part due to the ability to quickly and cheaply generate draft genomes from WGS data since microbial genomes are smaller and more compact in comparison to eukaryote genomes. This has enabled microbial draft genomes to be generated routinely with a fast turnaround time for important applications in food safety management like foodborne disease outbreak investigation and epidemiological surveillance, and AMR surveillance (see section 4.3.2). The traditional subtyping methods expose a very small fraction of the entire genomic information of the foodborne pathogen and therefore, provides limited resolution for discriminating outbreak-related strains from unrelated, sporadically circulating strains [79] .

The investigation begins with subtyping isolates that are obtained from affected individuals, implicated food products and production facilities. Isolation is important because of the legal implications associated with any public health interventions or regulatory actions taken [77] . It is critical that the subtyping tool used is able to identify the pathogen down to strain (clone) level resolution rather than the species level so that the sources of co-occurring outbreak can be differentiated and targeted intervention strategies can be implemented. The typing tool must be able to clearly and precisely resolve the isolates so that isolates belonging to linked cases can be identified for inclusion in investigation [77] . Similarly, it must also be able to differentiate concurrent, nonrelated and sporadic cases from outbreak cases so as not to confound the investigation [77] . The latter is getting increasingly important as foodborne pathogens can easily cross country boundaries due to globalisation of food supply chain and unrelated outbreak temporally and geographically overlap. The ability of WGS technology to resolve an outbreak source was well demonstrated during the 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak [79] , which is the most serious, recorded cholera epidemic in recent history. This outbreak is responsible for killing at least 8000 people and sickening over 600,000 individuals [96] . This successful NGS application was enabled through the rapid public release of sequence genomes by researchers with Vibrio cholerae collections [97] [98] [99] and by US CDC from the Haitian outbreak [79] . Through a joint analysis of available epidemiological data from the Haitian outbreak and publicly available sequence data as well as isolate data released from Nepalese authorities, strong evidence suggested a single-source introduction of the outbreak strain from Nepal (Nepalese UN contingent in Haiti) into Haiti [100] . Subsequently, several genomic-based epidemiological investigations also demonstrated the promising use of WGS in resolving outbreak investigations in a highly time sensitive manner and many reports on the use of WGS in outbreak investigations and surveillance have been published and some have been reviewed by the following excellent reviews [77, 78] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 405, "end": 409, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 850, "end": 854, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1012, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1348, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1528, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1680, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1685, "text": "[98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1690, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1735, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2054, "end": 2059, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2409, "text": "[77,", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 2410, "end": 2413, "text": "78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Whole Genome Sequencing in Foodborne Outbreak Investigation and Epidemiological Surveillance"}, {"text": "Globally, the most extensive and well-known WGS-based application for food safety management is the GenomeTrakr Network [101] .

This network aims to collect WGS data from foodborne bacterial pathogens and upload them quickly to a publicly accessible database, NCBI. Once genomic data of bacteria (e.g. Salmonella, Listeria, E. coli, Campylobacter, Vibrio, Cronobacter), parasites and viruses from US surveillance efforts are available, they are uploaded by GenomeTrakr into NCBI [102] . The NCBI Pathogen Detection website plots phylogenetic trees to generate daily clusters that determines the closest matches to newly submitted data [103, 104] . Genetic relatedness suggests potential linkages between the animal, food, environment and human isolates but it is not sufficient for regulatory action, unless it is supported by epidemiological evidence. Apart from country-specific effort in adopting WGS for food safety, a global effortknown as the Global Microbial Identifier (GMI)has been underway to suggest the creation of a global genomic infrastructure and database that will enable this revolutionary new technology to identify and characterize microorganisms from animals, food, environment and humans in a timely (minutes to hours) fashion through utilising an international interactive system of DNA databases containing the full genomes of all investigated microbial isolates in the world [105] .

AMR surveillance has typically relied on the isolation of culturable indicator microorganism (e.g. Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., E. coli and Enterococcus spp. [106] ) and the phenotypic characterization of animal, food, environmental and clinical isolates. This approach, when sometimes utilised together with PCR-based genotypic detection of AMR genes has been and will continue to be widely used in molecular epidemiology for AMR surveillance. However, such combinatorial approaches are unable to provide information on the mechanisms and drivers of AMR, and on the presence and spread of AMR genes throughout the global food chain [76] . The use of WGS can overcome these limitations and this is evidenced by the increasing number of publications describing various WGS applications for AMR surveillance among isolates from animals, food, environment and humans. One of the valuable WGS applications is the ability to predict phenotypic AMR profile with WGS-based genotypic AMR profile. This application has been demonstrated by several groups in S. enterica [107] [108] [109] , E. coli [110, 111] , Campylobacter spp. [112] , Staphylococcus aureus [113] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [114, 115] and high resistance phenotype-genotype correlation (>97%) is commonly seen.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 668, "end": 673, "text": "[106]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1147, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1576, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1577, "end": 1582, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1588, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1604, "text": "[110,", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1609, "text": "111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1636, "text": "[112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1666, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1703, "text": "[114,", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1708, "text": "115]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Whole Genome Sequencing in Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance"}, {"text": "Currently, WGS-based AMR surveillance has already been adopted nationwide by US public health surveillance system, known as the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) [116] . NARMS tracks changes in antimicrobial susceptibility and characterizes AMR in foodborne enteric bacteria found in ill people (CDC), retail meats (FDA), and food animals (USDA) [76, 116] . NARMS monitors antibiotic resistance among the following four major foodborne bacteria: Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., E. coli, and Enterococcus spp. [116] . In a recent review by NARMS, they mentioned that their WGS data alone can predict resistance in Salmonella [107] and other bacteria [111, 112] with a high degree of accuracy for most major drug classes [117] . They have also generated a simple and publicly available tool, Resistome Tracker that provides visually informative displays of antibiotic resistance genes in Salmonella across the globe [118] . Similarly, WGS-based AMR surveillance has also been conducted by the European Union (EU), through EU harmonized antimicrobial resistance monitoring program [119] . In their recent study, they found that horizontal transfer has played a major role in the spread of colistin resistance among bacteria (i.e. commensal bacteria and major foodborne pathogen (the example in this study is Salmonella) in Italian meatproducing animals [119] . This was demonstrated by the presence of the same transferable determinant of colistin-resistance on the same conjugative plasmid found in both E. coli and major Salmonella serotypes that were isolated from the same intensive-farming industry in Italy [119] . In general, a global WGS-based AMR surveillance system has yet to be implemented and most countries still depend on phenotyping testing and PCR-based genotypic methods for AMR surveillance. Nevertheless, many studies on the use of WGS-based AMR surveillance of abovementioned bacteria have been published and some are already described in excellent review by [76] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 188, "end": 193, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 372, "end": 376, "text": "[76,", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 377, "end": 381, "text": "116]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 540, "end": 545, "text": "[116]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 655, "end": 660, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 680, "end": 685, "text": "[111,", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 686, "end": 690, "text": "112]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 750, "end": 755, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 945, "end": 950, "text": "[118]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1114, "text": "[119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1386, "text": "[119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1646, "text": "[119]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 2008, "end": 2012, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Whole Genome Sequencing in Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance"}, {"text": "Metagenomics is a powerful tool that enables direct, culture-independent analysis of complex microbiome (e.g. food, water, fecal, soil, or environmental samples) in one analytical procedure (one sequencing run). It allows the genomes of difficult-toculture or non-culturable microorganisms to be analysed since the entire DNA content of a sample is sequenced, regardless of its origin [76] . Metagenomic data provides an in-depth taxonomic identification (i.e. to species/strain level) and the relative abundance of organisms present in the microbiome. Apart from characterizing the microbiome, metagenomics has potential application in AMR surveillance [120] . For example, it could facilitate the tracking of AMR genes and mobiles genetic elements in difficult-to-culture or non-culturable microorganisms, which might also play a role in transmission of AMR across the food chain, as well as the abundance and diversity of AMR genes in animals, food, environment and humans. As compared to the use of WGS for foodborne outbreak investigation and epidemiological surveillance, and AMR surveillance, the use of metagenomics for the same purposes are still in its early days (some examples have been discussed by a recent review from [76] ). In a recent extensive study that examined the single largest metagenomic AMR monitoring effort of livestock (9 EU countries, 181 pig and 178 poultry farms, 359 herds, >9000 animal samples and >5000 GB sequencing data), the pig and poultry resistomes showed great difference in abundance and composition [120] . There was a pronounced country-specific effect on the resistomes, more so in pigs than in poultry [120] . Pigs were found to have higher AMR loads, whereas poultry resistomes were more diverse. It is interesting to note that total AMR abundance in livestock was positively associated with the overall country-specific antimicrobial usage, and countries with comparable usage patterns had similar resistomes. However, total functional AMR abundance was not associated with antimicrobial usage. This suggests that some genes might not provide AMR functionality in their natural hosts with natural expression levels even though the same genes can provide AMR functionality when cloned and expressed in a host (usually E. coli) in functional metagenomic assays, and this may have implication on assessing the risk of AMR genes versus functional AMR genes to human health.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 385, "end": 389, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 654, "end": 659, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1549, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 1650, "end": 1655, "text": "[120]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Metagenomics for Foodborne Pathogens and Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms"}, {"text": "Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs [121] .

It is estimated that around 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from food systems, and agriculture is also linked to deforestation, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water overuse and socioeconomic impacts [123] .
