DNA-based HLA typing was performed by Luminex Multi-Analyte Profiling system (xMAP) with WAKFlow HLA typing kit (Wakunaga, Hiroshima, Japan) as described elsewhere [13]. Briefly, highly polymorphic exons 2 and 3 of HLA-A, -B, and -C genes and exon 2 of HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 genes were amplified using primer pairs attached to the kit. Each PCR product was hybridized with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes, complementary to the allele-specific sequences. Reproducibility was checked between two independent measurements of randomly chosen samples and the level of agreement was more than 99% (183/184 alleles). Samples showing ambiguous patterns were subjected to sequence-based typing by using AlleleSEQR HLA typing kit (Abbott JAPAN, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed on an ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).",

When the Contacts and No-contacts were collected together as a single control group, HLA-DRB1*1202 showed further significant association (p = 0.0011, p\nc = 0.014, data not shown). In our previous population-based study on Vietnamese HLA alleles, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*1202 allele in 170 healthy Hanoi citizens was 0.353 [13]. The frequency of HLA-DRB1*1202 in our SARS patients (0.466) remained higher than that of the general population in Hanoi. Under the dominant model, HLA-DRB1*1202 was the most strongly associated with SARS as shown in Table 4\n(p\nc = 0.0065 and 0.0052 depending on the controls to be compared).",

Although our conclusion here derives from the most rational deduction based on accumulated results of each small study, different associations in other studies could also be interpreted in other ways, for instance, by the interaction with other environmental or pathogenic factors such as possible difference of mutation in SARS-CoV. Alternatively, it is also possible that the HLA-genes are merely markers of the disease susceptibility and that other immune-related genes in the HLA regions may be more deeply involved in the risk of disease. Genetic contribution of non-HLA immune molecules has also been studied extensively even now [6], [7], [8]. We should collect all information and prepare for the threat of a future outbreak of emerging diseases such as H5N1 infection that causes lethal acute lung injury presumably through a similar immune mechanism.",
