In some, these sudden growth spurts result in clumsiness or awkwardness. Important social changes that occur in adolescents include developing a larger social network and transitioning their trust to peers with these peers becoming more important to them than their biological family. These peer relationships can help facilitate the development of interpersonal competence, more specifically; autonomy, identity, self-expression, coping, trust, and empathy (Arnett, 2006; Cassels et al., 2017; Choate, 2014; Malone, 2016; Munsey, 2006; Sturman & Moghaddam, 2011; Tanner & Arnett, 2009; van Houtte & Jarvis, 1995).",

These same authors define early adolescence as a period of independence versus dependence; of high self-consciousness and low self-disclosure. Pets have been found to serve as sounding boards, nonjudgmental listeners, and valuable confidants for adolescents seeking to share personal and private thoughts with someone who they can trust to maintain privacy (Marsa-Sambola et al., 2017).",

Early adolescents begin to gain an understanding that other people may think differently than they do, causing cognitive dissonance leading to the development of abstract thinking abilities as well as an increased capacity for problem solving (Choate, 2014; Malone, 2016; Noppe & Noppe, 2004). Early adolescents also tend to value their peer opinions when compared to earlier childhood. This is a change from earlier when the parental opinion was more important to the adolescent.",

            "text": "The late adolescent stage encompasses typical high school years, (ages 15\u201317). Their personality and temperament are more clearly defined, and their commitment to forming and maintaining interpersonal relationships are stronger. Researchers (Arnett, 2006; Malone, 2016; Marsa-Sambola et al., 2017; Tanner & Arnett, 2009) have defined the late adolescent stage as closeness versus distance with relationships with parents, siblings, and peers changing. Specifically, the late stage adolescent may focus more on education, employment, important intimate relationships, and possibly marriage (Arnett, 2006). Their relationships shift from being mainly dependent to one where power and responsibility is shared. They also demonstrate less commitment to family obligations (Arnett, 2006; Malone, 2016; Marsa-Sambola et al., 2017; Tanner & Arnett, 2009). At this stage of life, children are developing their personal set of values, goals, and beliefs (Erikson, 1997). As adolescents define themselves, their adopted values and beliefs may bring them closer to (or set them further apart from) their family and existing peer groups. In addition to the emotional changes occurring during this life stage, adolescents are also aware of physical changes that are happening to them and to their peers. How they interact with the world during this critical time helps to shape their roles in society and their future.",

They are increasingly concerned about how others view their bodies, if they are desirable, how the media defines what is acceptable or not, as well as their sexual orientation (Choate, 2014). Long-term relationships are explored in this stage, hopefully leading to the formation of ideals such as commitment, caring, and concern for others (Erikson, 1997). The role of friendships during later adolescence cannot be understated (Valkenburg, Peter, & Schouten, 2006). Negative experiences in this stage can cause people to feel a sense of loneliness, depression, and isolation.",

Self-esteem and self- efficacy are important in the formation of their identity. Experimentation is also part of forming an identity. Experimentation in clothing, hairstyles, makeup, roles, piercings, and sexuality are common. Although they have a strong desire to be part of a group, they also want to be seen as unique.

It is suggested that individuals in emerging adulthood are often in flux as they voluntarily enter into undergraduate or graduate education, where responsibility for their performance largely falls on their shoulders. They must choose the courses they take, the program of study they will follow in college, and how they will navigate the balance among academic and social pressures. While in some cases, parents may still be helping financially, often emerging adults are required to obtain a part-time job to help finance the education that they have chosen. Many emerging adults are in long-term relationships which may or may not result in full commitment by both parties, potentially causing trust issues to arise (Arnett, 2006; Malone, 2016; Munsey, 2006; Tanner & Arnett, 2009).",

Adolescents, depending on their developmental stage, vary in their style of thinking, engagement with others, perceptions, and emotional reactions. Working with an early stage adolescent is very different from working with an emerging adulthood adolescence. Some examples of these differences include: early adolescents being more financially supported by parents, whereas an emerging adulthood adolescent might be far more financially independent. This is also important when we look at who the adolescent turns to for emotional support. An early adolescent might look toward a large group of peers for support while an emerging adulthood adolescent might turn to a significant other or a close friend. This difference could be critical when assessing possible interventions or supports for individuals.",

However, in the late 20th century, animals became more humanized by humans (Irvine, 2004; Tipper, 2011). This domestication of working animals led to people keeping pets (Ault, 2016). The number of US households that report having pets has been growing consistently since 1988 when formal accounts were initiated. According to the American Pet Products Association (APPA), in 1988, 56% of US households had a pet. Clancy and Rowen (2003) further delineated this data and report that 37% of US households had a dog and 30% had a cat. In the most recent APPA National Pet Owners Survey (2017\u201318), it was reported that 68% of US households indicated having a pet, an increase of 12% over the 20 years.",

Their study found that pet owning adolescents, aged 9\u201312, scored higher on measures of autonomy, self-esteem, and self-concept. Hanselman (2001) expressed that a pet can be seen by an adolescent as a parent (authoritative role) or as a peer. When the adolescent sees their pet as an idealized mother or as similar to themselves they engage in mutual reciprocity emotions with their pet. Also, when the adolescent is mothering the pet, it has been suggested that they are also mothering themselves.",

Furthermore, Black (2009) found a correlation between high self-esteem and adolescent attachment to pets, and that negative self-esteem correlates with loneliness in adolescents. Interestingly, Black (2009) also reported that even though female adolescents are more likely than males to engage in nurturing behaviors toward humans, male adolescents are equally likely to engage in nurturing behaviors to their pets. Black (2009) also reports that this caring for the pet can be a buffer against loneliness, and as suicidal behavior is often a correlate of loneliness, suicidal behavior can also be moderated.",

Conversely, girls reported deriving more friendship and disclosed more to their pets than did boys. The study also found that the participants reported more satisfaction and experienced less conflict with their pets when compared to the same interactions with their siblings. Interestingly, the study found that girls reported more conflict with their pets compared to boys (Cassels et al., 2017).",

The conclusions were that although many of the studies have methodological issues and weaknesses, overall the research consistently indicates that animals appear to promote healthy child development.

In this study, they used the physical presence of a pet, compared to the subject thinking about their pet and no pet being present, on the number of goals set by the adolescent owner, and their confidence in achieving those goals. There was no difference between the physical presence of a pet and thinking about their pet. However, there was significant difference between the physical presence or thinking about their pet versus the no pet condition, in with the pet conditions, researchers saw in increase in goals and confidence. In the second part of the study, Zilcha-Mano et al. (2012) considered the impact of the participants pet attachment orientation (as either avoidant or anxious) on number of goals generated and confidence in achieving the goals. The number of goals set by the adolescent appears to be moderated by an avoiding attachment to their pet, in that this group set less goals. Participants who scored higher on either the avoidant or anxious pet attachment style, scored lower on confidence in achieving their goals. Similar findings were found for the safe haven moderator of the pet for the adolescent and that the attachment style also moderated the sense of the adolescents of having a safe haven or secure base. Overall Zilcha-Mano et al. (2012) conclude that the attachment theory works well in determining factors related to the human-human bond as well as the human-animal bond.",

These interventions include music, therapeutic touch, and visits by a therapy dog. As previously stated, there is anecdotal and scientific research that supports how a therapy dog can mitigate signs of stress such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. The therapy pet can be a distraction, a companion, have a calming influence, and may encourage patients to have pleasant thoughts. These researchers found that the intervention of the pet therapy program helped patients feel less pain, improved their mood and energy level, experience more calmness, and felt happier. Physiologically, however, their blood pressure and heart rate did not change when the intervention of the therapy pet occurred. Interestingly, the visit with the therapy dog lasted 10 min but still produced these results (Coakley & Mahoney, 2009).",

There is the possibility of an illness being transmitted to their pet or they might become more infected by a disease their pet may be carrying. While engaging with pets can be medically helpful (reduce blood pressure and heart rate), certain conditions may make it impossible for the adolescent to be near their pet. For example, medical tubing or other equipment may not permit the pet to sleep next to the adolescent as they did prior to the illness. Identifying strategies to maintain the adolescent-pet relationship even with the physical space challenges would be critical to the psychological well-being of both parties.",

Specifically, the study examined the influence of a pet attachment on adolescents\u2019 communication with significant others and the adolescents\u2019 perceptions of their quality of life. The study found that the adolescents\u2019 attachment to a dog partially mediates the effects of communication with significant others on quality of life, when the adolescent considered the dog or cat their own.

I had a pet dog for 18 years and she sensed when I was sick or depressed. She would look at me with her soulful eyes as if to say \u201cI understand\u201d and she would sit at/on my feet or curl up next to me on the couch and just \u201cbe\u201d with me.

Further, there was no difference in loneliness scores for cat or dog owners. Also, the adolescents\u2019 perceived bonding with their pets was negatively correlated with loneliness.

As loneliness and low self-esteem are often correlated with suicidal behaviors in adolescents, it would appear that having a pet in a rural community can be of benefit to the adolescent (Black, 2009; Shiloh et al., 2003; Winerman, 2017). Also, according to Black (2009), an adolescent\u2019s sense of attachment to their pet(s) also correlated positively with the number of human social supports for the adolescent.",

However, this population (Bender et al., 2007; Rew & Horner, 2003) has been shown to have strengths that assist them in their high-risk environment. Specifically, the homeless youths have resolve, self-efficacy, motivation, moral values, spirituality, pride, empathy, problem-solving ability, and a strong commitment to personal relationships. They also have self-confidence and are able to advocate for their physical well-being (Rew & Horner, 2003). These homeless adolescents, according to Bender et al. (2007), also demonstrate resourcefulness and self-improvement. They will turn to their peer community for support and guidance, especially when they are newcomers to homelessness. Further, these homeless youths will often have a canine companion who provides companionship, body heat when the weather is cold, and protection from would-be assailants, as well as the capacity to enjoy the human-animal bond (Bender et al., 2007; Rew & Horner, 2003).",

It has been estimated that approximately 2 million adolescents experience homelessness in a year and one quarter of these children are chronically homeless (Bender et al., 2007; Rew, 2000; Thompson et al., 2006). Priorities for these adolescents include the basic necessities of life\u2014food, shelter, clothing, medical assistance, and mental health assistance. For many of these homeless, their companion pets, typically dogs, are considered their best friend and necessary to their survival. Many homeless youth have indicated that they do not think they would still be alive if it were not for their pets, that their pets help lessens loneliness, and compensate for a lack of human friendship (Bender et al., 2007; Berkoff, 2013; Rew, 2000; Thompson et al., 2006). Yet, this can be a problem since many shelters do not allow pets, and so frequently, these people choose to live on the streets rather than give up their pet. Irvine (2013) writes extensively on the importance of pets to homeless populations. Pets, while not often welcome in homeless shelters, serve as protectors, social connections, and sources of emotional support for people who are homeless. They often make choices to go without food or health care for themselves to care for their pets (Irvine, 2013; Thompson et al., 2006).",

Pet-owning homeless adolescents were less likely to report on measures of loneliness (Purewal et al., 2017). Homeless youth identified two main strategies for coping with the loneliness, the first being with their friends and the second being with a companion dog. One factor that the homeless youth reported as a motivation for behaving responsibly was the need to take care of their companion dog (Bender et al., 2007; Rew, 2000; Rew & Horner, 2003).",

The IAMS pet food company produced a series of commercials (\u201cA boy and his dog Duck\u201d) evolving from a young boy and his new puppy running to and jumping into the car to the now grown boy and his aged dog needing encouragement to physically get into the car.

As the commercial progresses, the young boy becomes an older teenager appearing to be leaving for college.
