By 26 Apr, 2020, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than 3.0 million infections and above 200,000 deaths; 4 thus, its outbreak has become a global public health problem. Recently, COVID-19 epidemic in China has been well controlled, whereas the risk of imported COVID-19 cases has increased dramatically. 5 As of April 26, 2020, a total of 1,636 abroad imported patients were reported in China. 6 However, limited studies on full-length genome characterization of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 cases imported from abroad. Here, we characterized the genotype and mutation characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from eight imported cases from abroad in Yunnan, China.",

Dataset comprise SARS-CoV-2 full-length sequences of representative clade G, V, and S as previously reported, and reference sequences with the highest similarity (12 sequences) based on BLAST in Genbank using the eight sequences obtained in this study as the query set. Further, phylogenetic trees for SARS-CoV-2 full-length nucleotide sequences were constructed based on the obtained datasets with the maximum-likelihood method using IQ-tree. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the six isolates, including one from France (YN_Im02), two from Spain (YN_Im01 and YN_Im03), and three from the United States (YN_Im06-08) were clustered as G clade with a high bootstrap value of 99%, one strain from Cambodia (YN_Im04) was grouped into S clade with a bootstrap value of 80%, and the remaining one from Sri Lanka was classified within other clade, a large unclassified sequences because lack the signature variants (Fig.1C) . Of note, the three sequences YN_Im06-08 isolated from a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection formed a close monophyletic subclade supported by a bootstrap value of 100% and had 99.99% nucleotide identity, indicating the three sequences originate from the same strain.",
