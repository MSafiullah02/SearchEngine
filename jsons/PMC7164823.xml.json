TSLP activates DCs to strongly up\u2010regulate the expression of costimulatory molecules and to uniquely produce T helper (Th)2 cell\u2010attracting chemokines, thymus and activation\u2010regulated chemokine (TARC), and macrophage\u2010derived chemokine (MDC) \u2013 but not the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u201012, or TNF\u2010\u03b1 [3]. CD4+ T cells are primed by TSLP\u2010activated DCs to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells that produce the proallergic cytokines IL\u20104, IL\u20105, IL\u201013, and TNF\u2010\u03b1, while down\u2010regulating IL\u201010 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 [3, 4, 5]. In addition, na\u00efve CD8+ T cells are primed by TSLP\u2010activated DCs to produce IL\u20105 and IL\u201013, but exhibit poor cytolytic activity [6]. Moreover, human TSLP is produced by bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial smooth muscle cells, lung fibroblasts, and mast cells [1, 2, 3]. TSLP expression is increased in asthmatic airways and correlates with the expression of Th2\u2010attracting chemokines and disease severity [7, 8]. These data suggest that TSLP is involved in the pathogenesis of human asthma [9, 10, 11, 12].",

TSLP concentrations are increased in mice with antigen\u2010mediated airway inflammatory disease, and lung TSLP concentrations correlate with the severity of eosinophilia [13]. Furthermore, TSLPR\u2010deficient mice develop severely attenuated antigen\u2010mediated airway inflammatory disease [13, 14]. In the rhesus monkey model of dust\u2010mite\u2010induced allergic asthma, TSLP is expressed on airway respiratory cells and smooth muscle cells in sensitized monkeys [15]. Inhibition of OX40L, which is a critical downstream mediator in TSLP\u2010mediated immune responses [4, 5], inhibits Th2 inflammation in the monkey model of asthma [15]. These data suggest that TSLP plays a critical role in the development of asthma.",

TGF\u2010\u03b2, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u201022, and IL\u201023 play critical roles in IL\u201017 production in human T cells [18, 19, 20, 21], and the IL\u201023\u2013IL\u201017 axis is involved in human psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases, suggesting an important role for Th17 cytokines in chronic inflammatory diseases [17, 18, 22]. Although asthma is characterized by chronic dysregulated Th2 inflammation in the airways, recent human studies have shown that IL\u201017 is also expressed in the airways of patients with asthma, and IL\u201017 expression is increased in patients with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe asthma, compared with patients with mild asthma and with normal controls [23, 24, 25]. Thus, Th2 cells are predominantly involved in mild asthma, whereas a mixture of Th2 and Th1 cells with neutrophilic inflammation probably induced by Th17 cells affects more severe asthmatic disease [26]. Still, it has remained unclear how Th17 lineage commitment is mediated in Th2\u2010predominant inflammation, such as human asthma.",

We show that a combination of TSLP and TLR3 ligands activated human CD11c+ DCs to produce IL\u201023. In addition, the addition of poly(I : C) did not inhibit TSLP\u2010activated DCs to prime na\u00efve CD4+ T cells to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells. Furthermore, DCs activated by a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed more na\u00efve CD4+ T cells to differentiate into Th17\u2010cytokine\u2013producing cells with a central memory T cell phenotype compared with DCs activated by poly(I : C) alone.

After 24 h of culture, TSLP\u2010primed DCs produced high levels of TARC and MDC, while TSLP did not stimulate DC production of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u201012, IL\u201023, or TNF\u2010\u03b1, demonstrating one of the unique properties of TSLP in DC activation (Fig. 2a, left panels) [3, 34]. In contrast, poly(I : C) alone and LPS alone primed DCs to produce pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u201012, IL\u201023, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 (Fig. 2a, middle panels).

However, TSLP significantly up\u2010regulated poly(I : C)\u2010induced increase of IL\u201023 production (Fig. 2a, middle panels and 2b), which can induce CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th17 cells in humans [18, 19, 20]. Although TLRLs alone did not produce large amounts of TARC or MDC in DCs, TSLP strongly induced production of the Th2\u2010cell attracting chemokines, TARC and MDC, regardless of the presence of the TLRLs (Fig 2a, lower panels). Taken together, these data suggest that TSLP may maintain its unique ability in DC activation regardless of the presence of TLRLs.",

To examine whether TSLP retains this ability in the presence of TLRLs, we analysed the surface expression of CD80 on DCs by flow cytometry. Poly(I : C), LPS, LyoVec, and TSLP all stimulated surface CD80 expression in DCs (Fig. 2d). Notably, TSLP enhanced surface CD80 expression in the presence of TLRLs to an extent similar to that of TSLP alone. Another trait of TSLP stimulation in DCs is enhancement of DC survival [3, 35]. After 24 h of culture, TSLP augmented the number of viable DCs induced by the TLRLs (data not shown).

These results suggest that through DC activation, human TSLP and TLR3 ligands promote Th17\u2010cell differentiation under Th2\u2010polarizing conditions. If Th2 cells predominate in driving inflammation in mild asthma, there is evidence that a more severe asthmatic phenotype is regulated through a mixture of Th1 and Th2 cells with neutrophilic inflammation probably induced by Th17 cells in the lungs [26]. TSLP\u2010mediated Th17\u2010cell commitment under Th2\u2010polarizing conditions may be involved in the development of an inflammatory mixture of Th2 and Th17 cells, a unique profile that resembles severe asthma.",

These T cell subsets can be further divided into subsets that are prone to produce Th1 or Th2 cytokines according to their differential expression of chemokine and tissue\u2010homing receptors [40, 41, 42], linking memory T cell subsets with a polarized Th1 or Th2 function. TSLP\u2010DCs play important roles not only in Th2 priming but also in the maintenance and further polarization of Th2 central memory cells in allergic diseases [5]. In this study, we show that DCs activated by a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed na\u00efve CD4+ T cells to produce IL\u201017 and IL\u201022 and priming with TSLP+poly(I : C)\u2010DCs down\u2010regulated CD45RA and up\u2010regulated CD45RO in CD4+ T cells, acquiring a CD45RA\u2212CD45RO+CD62L+CCR7+ central memory T cell phenotype.Th17 cells are linked to the development of autoimmune diseases in vivo [16, 17] and the IL\u201023\u2013IL\u201017 axis is involved in human psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases, suggesting an important role for Th17 cytokines in chronic inflammatory diseases [17, 18, 22]. Therefore, IL\u201023\u2013mediated generation of Th17 central memory cells by TSLP+poly(I : C)\u2010DCs may be involved in maintenance of chronic inflammation of allergic diseases.",

In this study, we showed that TSLP and TLR3 ligand stimulation induced strong and unique activation of DCs. In addition, exacerbation of asthmatic inflammation is often triggered by infection involving airway\u2010targeting RNA viruses [27, 28, 29], and TSLP expression correlates with disease severity [7, 8]. Therefore, the TLR3 ligand may play dual roles in exacerbation of asthmatic inflammation through induction of TSLP by epithelial cells and activation of DCs in the presence of TSLP.",

We examined whether the TSLP and/or the TLR3 ligand can activate immature plasmacytoid DCs. However, stimulation of the TSLP and/or the TLR3 ligand did not directly induce CD80 up\u2010regulation and IFN\u2010\u03b1 secretion in immature plasmacytoid DCs (data not shown). In mice, plasmacytoid DCs can differentiate into myeloid DCs after viral infection and poly(I : C) injection to mice through type\u2010I IFN production [44]. Therefore, in humans, TLR3 ligands may play an additional role in exacerbation of asthmatic inflammation indirectly through conversion of plasmacytoid DCs to TSLPR\u2010expressing CD11c+ DCs.",
