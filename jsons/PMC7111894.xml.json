During the 2002\u20132003 epidemic, close to 8100 people were infected worldwide, among which 774 people died (WHO, 2003). Although the epidemic was relatively small in scale, the virus had a major socioeconomic impact and created global health concerns. Since then, only a few isolated incidences of SARS infection have been reported, most of which were linked to accidental exposures to the virus in a laboratory setting. However, considering the fact that some animal reservoirs that harbor the virus come into close contact with humans (Guan et al., 2003, Lau et al., 2005, Martina et al., 2003), the virus is highly likely to resurface again. Development of a vaccine and/or antiviral agents is critical to prevent future epidemics.",

S proteins of many coronaviruses are cleaved into, and function as, two separate subunits, S1 and S2 (Abraham et al., 1990, Jackwood et al., 2001, Mounir and Talbot, 1993); the S1 subunit binds a receptor and the S2 subunit induces fusion between viral and cellular membranes. However, S protein of SARS-CoV does not appear to be cleaved (Han et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003). Nevertheless, it is presumed to have two functional domains, and the border between them has been suggested to be around amino acid 680 (Lio and Goldman, 2004).",

ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein of 805 amino acids that contains one HEXXH + E zinc-binding consensus sequence (Donoghue et al., 2000, Tipnis et al., 2000). It is a homolog of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which plays an important role in the renin\u2013angiotensin system for blood pressure homeostasis. ACE does not function as a receptor for SARS-CoV despite over 40% amino acid identity and 60% similarity to ACE2 (Li et al., 2003). It has been reported that DC-SIGNR (a protein related to DC-SIGN [dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin]) could serve as an alternative receptor (Jeffers et al., 2004). This finding, however, is contradictory to results from another study, which suggested that DC-SIGNR, as well as DC-SIGN, enhance infections mediated by ACE2 but do not function as receptors by themselves (Marzi et al., 2004). The precise role of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR in SARS-CoV infection and pathogenesis is yet to be elucidated.",

A crystal structure of ACE2 has been resolved (Towler et al., 2004), which is facilitating SARS research. A minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) has been narrowed down to a 193 amino acid fragment (residues 318\u2013510), which actually binds ACE2 with greater affinity than does a larger protein fragment representing the S1 domain (residues 12\u2013672; Wong et al., 2004). Recent site-directed mutagenesis analyses of ACE2 revealed several amino acid residues important for binding S glycoprotein (Li et al., 2005b). To characterize interactions between S protein and the receptor in greater detail, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis analyses of ACE2. The results revealed that charged amino acids between residues 22 and 57 are important for virus infection. We have applied this information in designing peptide-based entry inhibitors and identified one that has potent antiviral activity. The results of our study contribute to better understanding of SARS-CoV entry and discovery of a novel antiviral agent against the virus.",

These amino acids are shown in Figs. 1B and C. To evaluate determinants of interaction between ACE2 and S glycoprotein in greater detail, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis analyses. We focused on charged amino acid residues on \u03b1-helices 1 and 2 for two reasons. First, alignment of amino acid sequences of ACE2 and ACE, which does not support SARS-CoV infection, revealed significant divergence in these helices (only 32% and 24% identity between a.a. 20\u201379 of ACE2 and two homologous domains a.a. 41\u2013100 and a.a. 644\u2013703 of ACE, respectively; Fig. 1A). Second, electrostatic attraction is the predominant force in protein\u2013protein interactions. Observations that residues D454 and, to a lesser degree, E452 on S glycoprotein are important for binding ACE2 (Wong et al., 2004) suggested possible interactions with oppositely charged amino acids on ACE2. We were particularly interested in the role of eight charged residues (other than K31) on \u03b1-helix 1 (residues E22, E23, K26, D30, H34, E35, E37 and D38) because they are situated near an imaginary line along amino acids already known to be important for binding S protein (Fig. 1C).",

Mutations were introduced into a plasmid encoding a full-length ACE2 gene (Li et al., 2003). HeLa cells, which are not susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, were transfected with plasmids that encode either the wild type or mutant ACE2 proteins. These cells were infected with non-replicating SARS pseudoviruses (MuLV pseudotyped with S glycoprotein; Han et al., 2004) to determine effects of mutations on viral entry. Disappointingly, mutations had only modest effects on pseudovirus infectivity (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we were surprised to observe only about 40% reduction in infectivity for K31A mutant since Li et al. (2005b) showed near complete loss of binding activity between ACE2 and S1 protein fragment containing K31D mutation. This discrepancy could be due to the difference between pseudovirus infection and protein\u2013protein binding assays. Alternatively, the difference could be due to the use of less drastic mutation in our study (i.e. K to A rather than K to D). Yet, another possibility was that 1-h virus adsorption period, which we routinely used, might be too long to observe subtle differences between the wild type and the mutant proteins.",

            "text": "To explore whether there is a difference between the wild type and mutant ACE2 in virus entry kinetics, pseudoviruses were adsorbed to cells for various times between 5 and 120 min. The kinetic analysis was performed for the wild type and D30A mutant ACE2 proteins (Fig. 2B). For the wild type ACE2, there was rapid adsorption of SARS pseudoviruses to cells between 10 and 20 min as indicated by an exponential increase in virus titer. The virus titer continued to increase up to 90 min, albeit at a slower rate. 50% maximal infection was achieved by approximately 18 min. In contrast, an infection mediated by D30A mutant ACE2 was significantly slower; it took twice as long to achieve 50% maximal infection (about 36 min). More importantly, the difference in pseudovirus infectivity between the wild type and D30A ACE2 proteins was more pronounced for 20-min adsorption period compared to 60 min; very little difference was observed for adsorption periods longer than 60 min. These results suggested that different ACE2 proteins should be compared at 20 min rather than at 60 min when infectivity begins to reach a plateau. Therefore, the entire panel of ACE2 mutants was compared using a 20-min adsorption period. Under this condition, all of the mutants, except for K68A, K74A and E75A, exhibited marked reduction in their ability to support pseudovirus infection (Fig. 2C). The reduction in infectivity was not due to a defect in protein expression since all of the mutant ACE2 proteins were expressed at levels similar to that of WT ACE2 (Fig. 2D). Flow cytometry analyses of cells transfected with either WT or D30A mutant ACE2 proteins indicated that both proteins are equally expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 2E). Together, these results indicated the importance of charged amino acids between residues 22 and 57.",

            "text": "Another parameter that could potentially affect infectivity of SARS pseudoviruses is the receptor concentration. Depending on the mutation, the amount of ACE2 protein required for efficient infection could be different. Similar to how mutant ACE2 proteins required longer adsorption period, greater amounts of mutant proteins might be necessary compared to the wild type. To test this hypothesis, infectivity of SARS pseudoviruses in HeLa cells transfected with varying amounts of plasmids encoding either the wild type or D30A mutant ACE2 proteins was determined. For this experiment, 1-h adsorption period was used. As expected, SARS pseudovirus infectivity was dependent on the amount of plasmids used for both the wild type and D30A mutant ACE2 (Fig. 3A). However, greater amount of DNA was needed for D30A mutant than the wild type to achieve similar infectivity; the half maximal infectivity points for the wild type and the D30A mutant were approximately 0.16 \u03bcg and 0.41 \u03bcg, respectively. To confirm that expression of ACE2 was proportional to the amount of plasmid DNA transfected, a Western immunoblot was performed. As shown in Fig. 3B, ACE2 expression correlated with the amount of DNA transfected. Expression levels of the wild type and D30A mutant proteins were comparable, suggesting that diminished infectivity with D30A mutant is likely due to reduced affinity to S protein. An immunoreactive band of an approximately 50 kDa protein was also detected in this over-exposed blot. Although the exact nature of the protein is unknown, it most likely is a cleavage product of ACE2 since the band intensity correlated with that of the authentic ACE2.",

When 60-min adsorption period was used, significant reduction in infectivity was observed only for K26A and D30A mutants (Fig. 3C). Using 40-min adsorption, infectivity was markedly reduced not only for K26A and D30A mutants, but also for E56A and E57A (Fig. 3D).

Upon close examination of the ACE2 crystal structure, we noticed that the spacing between S44 and L351 was sufficiently narrow enough to be filled by a single amino acid (Fig. 4B). However, the directionality of the E22\u2013S44 fragment was opposite from that of the L351\u2013K353 fragment. Glycine, which has the smallest side chain, has high propensity to form reverse turns. Thus, an artificial peptide of 31 amino acids was synthesized by joining fragments 22\u201344 and 351\u2013357 with glycine (peptide P6; Fig. 4B). To our surprise, peptide P6 potently inhibited SARS pseudovirus infection with an IC50 of approximately 0.1 \u03bcM, which is 60- and 500-fold lower than peptides P5 and P4, respectively (Fig. 5C). This was somewhat unexpected since P6 is different from P4 only by eight amino acids. Slightly higher IC50 value (0.3 \u03bcM) was observed when pseudovirus infections were carried out using VeroE6 cells (data not shown). The inhibitory effect is specific against SARS-CoV since none of the peptides inhibited VSV-G-pseudotyped MuLV even at 100 \u03bcM (Fig. 4D). The specificity is further evidenced by the fact that none of the peptides was effective against viruses pseudotyped with MuLV envelope protein (data not shown). No cytotoxicity was observed for peptides P4, P5 or P6 even at 200 \u03bcM based on neutral red uptake assay (data not shown).",

The two most critical residues were K26 and D30. This result and the fact that all 9 charged residues between E22 and D38 played an important role were not unexpected given that they are situated in close proximity to the imaginary line that connects amino acids previously shown to be important for binding S protein fragments (Li et al., 2005b; Fig. 1C). In this regard, we were a bit surprised to see the importance of residues E56 and E57, but not K68, K74 or E75. None of the amino acids we identified was critical enough to inhibit virus infection completely. Mutants were merely less efficient than the wild type ACE2; they required either longer adsorption period or greater amounts to achieve the wild type level of infectivity.

It was previously shown that a D454A mutation on S protein completely abolished association of ACE2 with either the RBD (residues 318\u2013510) or the S1 protein fragment (residues 12\u2013672; Wong et al., 2004). Based on this result, we suspected that D454 residue might be directly interacting with ACE2. However, D454 was quite distant from ACE2 in the crystal structure (Fig. 5C). This seemingly contradictory result raises a possibility that the RBD used to solve the crystal structure may have different conformation than the one used to analyze D454A mutation; they are different in length and were prepared from different cellular sources (Sf9 insect cells vs. 293T human cells, respectively). Although it is possible that D454 plays an indirect role in binding ACE2 (e.g. in maintaining a proper conformation of the RBM), it is a little difficult to appreciate such a drastic effect from an amino acid far away from the receptor-contacting site, especially when the residue is located in a loop.

            "text": "A third possible reason for the discrepancy could be the difference in the nature of the two studies. The footprint analysis based on a crystal structure identifies only the residues that are making initial contacts with the RBD. In contrast, our study examined the entire virus entry process and identifies residues that are functionally important, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, the residues we identified could be involved not just in the initial binding of S glycoprotein, but in subsequent steps in the membrane fusion process. Events that follow binding of S glycoprotein to ACE2 are unknown. Additional studies are necessary to better understand the molecular details of SARS-CoV entry.",

            "text": "In this study, we examined anti-SARS activity of six chemically synthesized peptides derived from ACE2. The peptide with the most potent antiviral activity was P6, which is comprised of two discontinuous fragments 22\u201344 and 351\u2013357 connected by glycine. Peptide P6 is just eight amino acids longer than P4. Yet, it was about 500-fold more effective. In contrast, P5, which is 13 amino acids longer than P4, was only about 8-fold more effective. It is not clear as to exactly why P6 is so much more potent than P4 or P5 peptides. The simplest explanation is that there are more residues on P6 that interact with S glycoprotein than either P4 or P5 peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses indicated that amino acids K353, D355 and R357 are important for binding a S1 protein fragment (Li et al., 2005b). Furthermore, residues K353 and G354 make direct contacts with the RBM of S protein as shown in the crystal structure (Li et al., 2005a). Thus, four of seven residues between 351 and 357 play a role in virus infection. In contrast, only 3 of 13 amino acids between residues 45 and 57 are known to be involved in binding or mediating SARS infection (L45, E56 and E57; Li et al., 2005a and this study). However, the qualitative aspect of the interaction could be more important than simply the number of amino acids that interact between ACE2 and S protein. An interesting question that remains to be answered is whether a peptide fragment containing just the residues 351\u2013357 could inhibit SARS infection. Assessing antiviral activity of this peptide could provide insights as to whether there is synergy between residues 22\u201344 and 351\u2013357 in the context of the P6 peptide.",

            "text": "At the present time, we understand neither the P6 peptide structure nor how it interacts with S glycoprotein. If the peptide folds into a structure as it appears in the crystal structure of ACE2, then the peptide should bind the RBM as illustrated in Fig. 5D; the contact sites on S protein would include residues Y436, Y440, Y442, N473, Y475, N479, Y484, T486, T487, G488 and Y491. It is possible, however, that P6 may fold slightly differently as a free peptide. For one thing, residues 22\u201344 form a highly amphipathic \u03b1-helix; while one side of the helix that binds S protein is highly polar with many charged amino acids, the opposite side that faces interior of ACE2 is hydrophobic (Fig. 4B). These hydrophobic amino acids would be exposed to an aqueous environment in a free peptide, which might make the \u03b1-helical structure less stable. Secondly, although residues 351\u2013357 are a part of \u03b2-turn-\u03b2 structure in an intact ACE2, they might not exist in the same conformation due to the absence of other residues that support formation of this secondary structure. Regardless, potent antiviral activity of the P6 peptide suggests that its conformation most likely resembles the one in the ACE2 crystal structure, at least when it is bound to S protein.",
