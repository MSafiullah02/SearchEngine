Ticks are classified into three families: the Ixodidae, or hard ticks; the Argasidae, or soft ticks; and the Nuttalliellidae, a much lesser known family, with characteristics of both hard and soft ticks.2 Ixodid ticks have a hard dorsal plate or scutum, which is absent in the soft-bodied, argasid ticks. Ixodid ticks also exhibit more sexual dimorphism than argasid ticks, with both genders looking alike. However, all blood-fed ticks, especially females, are capable of enormous expansion and engorged ixodid females are often confused with engorged argasid females. Although ticks from all families may serve as disease vectors, the ixodid or hard ticks are responsible for most tick-borne diseases in the United States.",

Argasid ticks are leathery and have subterminally attached mouth parts that are not visible dorsally. Argasid ticks prefer to live in more sheltered environments, including animal nests, caves, crevices, woodpiles, and uninhabited rural cabins. All ticks feed by cutting a small hole in the host's epidermis with their chelicerae and then inserting their hypostomes into the cut, with blood flow maintained by salivary anticoagulants.2 Ticks are attracted to warm-blooded hosts by vibration and exhaled carbon dioxide. Ixodid ticks actually \u201cquest\u201d for hosts by climbing onto vegetation with their forelegs outstretched; waiting to embrace passing hosts (Fig. 298-1\n). Ticks spend relatively short periods of their lives mating and blood-feeding on hosts: soft ticks feed rapidly for hours and then drop off, whereas hard ticks blood-feed for days (6 to 12) before dropping off for egg laying.",

Erythema migrans also occurs in STARI at the site of Amblyomma americanum or lone star tick attachment and results from the subcutaneous centrifugal movement of the spirochetes from the bite sites to the central circulation and target organs (see Fig. 298-5).",

However, unlike LB, STARI is not a reportable infectious disease and has no diagnostic serologic tests, such as enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs), immunofluorescent assays (IFAs), and Western immunoblot assays. In addition, a microbiologic analysis of skin biopsy specimens obtained from the rashes of 30 patients in Missouri with clinical diagnoses of STARI failed to detect B. lonestari, suggesting that STARI could be caused by other pathogens.25 Because some patients have recovered from STARI without antibiotic treatment and there have been no long-term sequelae reported in STARI cases, some have questioned whether antibiotic therapy is indicated in STARI. Because distinguishing STARI from LB may be difficult, Wormser and co-workers have recommended that the differential diagnosis rely on a combination of regional exposures, clinical presentations, serologic results, and potential for long-term sequelae based on their comparison of LB cases from New York and STARI cases from Missouri.25 The investigators noted that the timing of rash onset was shorter (6 days) in STARI compared with LB (10 days) and that STARI patients were less likely to be symptomatic than LB patients.25 In addition, the STARI rash was more often circular with central clearing than the LB rash.25 Most authorities recommend antibiotic therapy for STARI with oral doxycycline or amoxicillin following the same regimen as for LB to cover any missed diagnoses of LB with potential for chronic arthritic and cardiac sequelae (see Table 298-2).25\n",

The relapsing febrile episodes result from the growth of new spirochete populations in the blood to replace those killed by macrophages and cytokines. Most patients have splenomegaly, 10% will have hepatomegaly, and most will have elevated aminotransferase levels, unconjugated bilirubin, and prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times.24, 27 Direct neurologic involvement is more common than in LB and may include cranial nerve neuritis (especially cranial nerves VII and VIII), radiculopathy, and myelopathy. Myocarditis is also more common than in LB; may be complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly; and is often fatal. Diagnostic and treatment strategies for TBRF are outlined in Table 298-2.",

The rickettsiae may be further stratified clinically into the tick-borne spotted fever group and mouse mite\u2013transmitted rickettsialpox caused by Rickettsia akari (see Chapter 189). The rickettsiae are obligate intracellular, gram-negative bacteria that thrive in ixodid tick salivary glands and are transmitted during blood-feeding. Once injected into the host, rickettsiae are initially distributed regionally via lymphatics, with some species causing marked regional lymphadenopathy (e.g., Rickettsia slovaca). Within 2 to 14 days (mean, 7 days), rickettsiae are disseminated hematogenously to vascular endothelial lining cells of target organs, including the central nervous system (CNS), lungs, and myocardium. Rickettsiae gain entry into host endothelial cells in a Trojan horse\u2013like manner by using their outer membrane proteins (OmpA and OmpB) to stimulate endocytosis. Once within phagosomes, rickettsiae escape to enter the cytosol or nucleus for rapid replication by binary fission, safe from host immune attack. The tick-borne rickettsial diseases that cause spotted fevers (SFs) are compared in a descending order of clinical severity of infection by preferred tick vectors and wild animal reservoirs in Table 298-3\n.",

The pathophysiologic mechanisms of petechial rashes and target organ system damage (CNS, lungs, heart) in the SF rickettsioses include vascular endothelial cell damage by microbial replication, vascular inflammation (vasculitis), and increased widespread vascular permeability, which may result in hypovolemic shock, oliguric prerenal failure from acute tubular necrosis, cerebral edema, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Distal, digital skin necrosis may occur in severe cases of RMSF and QTT from hypoperfusion.32 Cardiac vasculitis may manifest as myocarditis with intraventricular conduction blocks. Aside from petechial rash and thrombocytopenia, other hemorrhagic manifestations in RMSF and other SFs are rare. CNS complications in RMSF and other severe SF infections may include ataxia, photophobia, transient deafness, focal neurologic deficits, meningismus, meningoencephalitis, seizures, and coma.

Q fever is a zoonosis with worldwide distribution and extensive domestic animal (cattle, sheep, goats, cats, dogs), wild animal (birds, rabbits, reptiles), and arthropod (ticks) reservoirs. In most cases, humans are not infected by tick bites but by inhaling spores or bacteria in aerosols contaminated with infectious particles in dried animal feces, milk, or products of conception.33, 34 Q fever may also be transmitted by ingestion of contaminated milk, by vertical transmission from mother to fetus, by contaminated blood product transfusion, and even percutaneously by crushing infected ticks near breaks in the skin barrier.",

Its causative agent, Francisella tularensis, was later identified as a gram-negative coccobacillus by Dr. Edward Francis during an investigation of deer fly fever in Utah in 1921.36 Tularemia occurs in regional pockets worldwide, has a very large wild and domestic animal reservoir, and is seasonally transmitted to humans by ixodid tick and deer fly bites and by contact with infected animals, especially rabbits and muskrats. The primary tick vector of tularemia in the United States is the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (Fig. 298-7\n). Tick-transmitted tularemia is most commonly reported during the spring and summer (May to August) worldwide. Tularemia transmitted through contact with an infected animal occurs more often during the fall through hunting and trapping seasons, especially among male hunters who field-clean infected animal carcasses. F. tularensis is an extremely stable microorganism in nature, surviving in soil, water, and animal carcasses for months to years. In addition to fecal or vomit contamination of tick bites and direct inoculation of intact skin or mucosal surfaces when crushing ticks or skinning animals, tularemia may be transmitted by ingesting raw or undercooked infected game or bush meats, drinking contaminated water, or inhaling aerosolized microorganisms.37, 38, 39\n",

Diagnostic strategies for tularemia include the following: microscopic identification or culture in Biosafety Level 3 facilities of microorganisms from blood, sputum, gastric lavage fluid, lung biopsy, or lymph node aspirates (sensitivity, 10% to 25%); acute and convalescent serology comparing antibody titers (sensitivity, >85%); direct immunofluorescent antibody testing; and antigen detection by PCR assay (sensitivity, 50% to 73%). Frequently accompanying laboratory abnormalities in tularemia include significant elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), significant leukocytosis (>10,000/\u00b5L), often with normal differential counts, and thrombocytosis. The recommended treatment strategies for tularemia have evolved considerably from historical treatments with painful intramuscular injections of streptomycin to oral therapy with the aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, which are effective in 86% of cases and may result in resolution of ulcers within 72 hours. Most cases in adults, including pneumonic tularemia, may be managed with fluoroquinolones alone (ciprofloxacin, 400 mg IV or 500 mg PO twice daily for 7 to 14 days, or levofloxacin, 500 mg IV or PO twice daily for 7 to 14 days), with aminoglycosides (gentamicin or amikacin, 3 to 5 mg/kg/day for 10 to 14 days) reserved for pediatric infections and widely disseminated systemic infections. Relapse rates are highest with oral tetracyclines, including doxycycline, and chloramphenicol, which may still be indicated for cases with CNS dissemination despite its potential for bone marrow toxicity.",

Since 1986, four new tick-borne bacterial species have been identified and classified into a new family, Anaplasmataceae. The four genera of Anaplasmataceae comprise obligate, intracellular, gram-negative bacteria, closely related genetically to the family Rickettsiaceae. The Anaplasmataceae include two genera that are synergistic parasites of flatworms (Neorickettsia sennetsu) and filarial worms (Wolbachia spp.) and two genera that are tick-borne bacterial infections of many mammals, including humans, Ehrlichia and Anaplasma (Fig. 298-8\n).42, 43 Like rickettsiae, the Anaplasmataceae attach to molecular ligands on phagocytic cells to gain Trojan horse\u2013like entry into leukocytes and then trick intracellular phagosomes into releasing them into the cytosol for replication (see Fig. 298-8).43, 44\n",

Because transovarian transmission in ticks has not been observed, the major reservoirs of the Anaplasmataceae in nature are wild and domestic animals.42, 43 Although the presenting clinical manifestations are similar among Anaplasmataceae infections, the potential multisystem complications and resulting CFRs from these diseases are ultimately determined by the immunocompetence of human hosts (see Table 298-5). The human Anaplasmataceae are resistant to fluoroquinolones but remain susceptible to tetracyclines, which are now recommended for children and adults.

Theobald Smith later identified the causative agent of bovine red water fever in 1893 as Babesia bigemina, accurately described the parasite's life cycle, and demonstrated for the first time the arthropod-borne transmission of an infectious disease to a mammal. Although more than 100 species of Babesia have now been identified as zoonoses in domestic and wild mammals, only a few species can cause babesiosis in humans, a disease characterized by fever, intravascular hemolysis, and hemoglobinuria (Table 298-6\n). In severe cases, usually in elderly, immunocompromised, or splenectomized human hosts, massive hemoglobinuria may be associated with severe anemia, jaundice, acute renal failure, and increased CFRs. Babesiosis is now reemerging as an arthropod-borne parasitic disease, as confirmed by increasing numbers of reported cases in the northeast United States and increasing seroprevalence rates there and in California.45, 46, 47\n",

Except for the Old World TBEVs with sheep reservoirs, all the TBEVs are transmitted by the injection of infected saliva from viremic ixodid ticks. During blood-feeding, viruses in tick saliva increase up to 10-fold and render early removal of the feeding tick ineffective in preventing disease. The preferred wild animal reservoirs for TBEVs include rodents, insectivores, medium-sized mammals, deer and other ungulates, birds, and, less often, domestic animals (see Table 298-7).",

Patients with Powassan encephalitis present with somnolence, headache, confusion, high fever, weakness, ataxia, and CSF lymphocytosis. Transient improvement may be followed by neurologic deterioration, evidence of ischemia or demyelination on magnetic resonance imaging, and slow recovery, often with permanent deficits including memory loss, weakness, ophthalmoplegia, and lower extremity paraparesis. Unlike the Old World TBEVs, Powassan encephalitis is uncommon, with only 31 confirmed cases reported by the CDC from 1958 to 2001. Because there is no vaccine or specific therapy for Powassan encephalitis, the best means of prevention is protection from tick bites. Since 2008, Powassan encephalitis cases historically confined to the northeastern United States and Canada have been increasingly confirmed farther westward in Minnesota and Wisconsin, with fatal cases reported in the elderly.54\n",

Old World TBEV is typically biphasic in over 70% of cases, with an initial febrile flulike presentation followed by a 1-week (range, 1 to 21 days) symptom-free interval. This honeymoon or recovery period is followed by meningoencephalitis with CSF pleocytosis, with or without myelitis, and a poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis that targets the arms, neck, and shoulders. Magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalographic abnormalities are common but nonspecific. Other acute neurologic complications may include altered consciousness, seizure activity, cranial nerve palsies, and an often fatal bulbar syndrome with cardiorespiratory failure. Because no specific treatments other than supportive therapy exist, tick avoidance and immunization remain the best preventive measures. Effective vaccines have now been developed for the three subtypes of Old World TBEVs, and some have been shown to even provide cross-protection among the subtypes in experimentally infected animals.",

They are characterized clinically by biphasic illnesses that present as febrile flulike symptoms and end as hepatomegaly and hemorrhagic manifestations (petechiae, purpura, subconjunctival and pharyngeal hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, cerebral hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation) separated by a few afebrile days. CFRs range from 10% to over 50%, with most deaths occurring within 5 to 14 days of symptom onset during hemorrhagic stages. Diagnoses may be confirmed by immunologic techniques, such as antibody increases in paired sera and ELISA, and by molecular techniques, such as RT-PCR. Although ribavirin can inhibit Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus replication in animal models, it has not been tested in clinical trials in humans with CCHF. Nevertheless, if TBHF is suspected in the tropics and laboratory confirmation is unavailable, intravenously administered ribavirin (30 mg/kg initially, followed by 16 mg/kg four times daily for 4 days, and then 8 mg/kg three times daily for 6 days) is recommended for severe cases, and oral ribavirin is recommended for high-risk contacts. All patients with TBHFs should be placed in isolation, and strict universal precautions should be practiced by all medical personnel. A mouse brain\u2013derived CCHF vaccine has been developed in Bulgaria but is not available elsewhere. In the absence of a universal vaccine, the best preventive measures for the TBHFs are tick avoidance and control, rapid burial of dead animals, and personal protective equipment for abattoir workers and medical personnel.",

The coltiviruses are maintained in nature by ixodid ticks that blood-feed on wild animal hosts with prolonged viremias and then transmit coltiviruses trans-stadially but not transovarially. Infected nymphs hibernate over winter, and previously infected nymphs and newly infected adults then transmit coltiviruses to human dead-end hosts during spring-summer blood-feeding.

In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, tick paralysis is caused by the American dog tick, D. variabilis, or the Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor andersoni, during April through June, when Dermacentor ticks emerge from hibernation to mate and to seek blood meals (see Fig. 298-7).57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62 The mechanism of neurotoxic paralysis in Dermacentor tick paralysis is unknown, but neuroelectrophysiologic studies have suggested that sodium flux across axonal membranes is blocked at the nodes of Ranvier, leaving neuromuscular transmission unimpeded.63 In Australia, the marsupial ixodid tick, Ixodes holocyclus, can cause a more severe form of ascending neuromuscular paralysis by producing a botulinum-like neurotoxin that blocks neuromuscular transmission by inhibiting the presynaptic release of acetylcholine.63\n",
