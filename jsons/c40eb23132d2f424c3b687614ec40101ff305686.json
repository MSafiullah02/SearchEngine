At the time when the microorganisms were not yet known, the mechanisms of transmission of contagion were already well apprehended. Based on the same knowledge but thanks to new technologies, such hospitals have now been built downtown, next to the most highly performing technological plateau.

            "text": "Years before germ theory, humans knew that some diseases were transmissible from human to human. Syphilis is generally believed to have come originally from the New World, imported into Europe by Christopher Columbus's sailors after their famous voyage in 1492, and the sexual nature of syphilis transmission and its contagiousness was noticed from the beginning. The contagiousness of leprosy, cholera, and plague was immediately recognized from as early as 1377, when the rector of the seaport of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) made mandatory for the first time a trentina (30-day isolation period) for ships coming from areas suspected of plague [2] . Furthermore, sick patients were cared for in places established outside the city walls [3] . Soon after in 1423, Venice set up the first lazaretto, a quarantine station (with a 40-day isolation period) dedicated to people coming from infected areas, which became a model for European countries, especially in Marseille [3] . The discovery of germ theory [4] , the availability of diagnostic microbiology laboratories, the availability of vaccines, and the discovery of antibiotics led physicians and hospital policy makers to lose their interest in classic transmissible infectious diseases, believing that they had won the war against germs. Unfortunately, in the early 20th century, hospital-acquired infections and increased antibiotic resistance [5] were quickly followed by worldwide outbreaks of viral diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and viral hemorrhagic fevers; microbiology laboratory accidents; and hospital-acquired outbreaks of Clostridium difficile colitis [6] . The revived infection controls in hospitals and microbiology laboratories led to new questions and new scientific knowledge. Laboratory biosecurity rules were made mandatory and infection control in hospitals was reinforced with emphasis on preparedness to future threats. Single bedrooms were shown as a means to avoid influenza transmission in hospitals [7] , whereas hand hygiene [8] and catheter control have been proven efficient in the fight of frequent hospital-acquired infection [9, 10] . Fast microbiological identification [11] , such as diagnosis at the point of care (POC), has also been reported as an efficient means to control contagion [12] ; in addition, microbiologic and epidemiological surveys should help to anticipate sanitary crises. The SARS lessons lead to the revival of patient biocontainment, suggesting the creation of high-level isolation units (HLIUs) across the word [13, 14] and updating healthcare protocols for secure care of very highly contagious patients [15] , which have been proven efficient in the care of Ebola virus disease in Europe and the United States [16] .",

            "text": "Based on past experience [17] , Marseille's University Hospital Institute (IHU) architecture was designed to achieve these objectives in combining in one building care and research on contagious patients, epidemiological surveys, advanced microbiology and POC diagnostics, human and social sciences approaches of contagion, innovative technologies to monitor hand hygiene and catheter management, remote control fever detection, a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory and healthcare unit, and an optimized circuit for diagnostic care and research on contagious patients [18] . and transit of diverse goods, food, and travelers, and with them microorganisms (causing plague, cholera, etc) has always been a major issue for the city. Since the 12th century, quarantine and isolation of patients has been a structuring public health issue. Marseille in 1120 used the Fort Saint-Jean as a containment area and created the first lazaret in 1526 (under Aragon Spanish Kingdom rule), then built the first hospital Hotel Dieu in 1643 and the Lazaret of Saint Martin of Arenc installed in the northern part of the city in 1814. All of these quarantine stations were situated out of town but on the coast of Marseille. In 1821, a large yellow fever outbreak in Africa reached Spain, indicating that Europe was not protected against this disease. Finally, it was on the Frioul Island, at the forefront of Marseille, that was erected in 1828 the Caroline hospital designed by the architect M. R. Penchaud (1772-1833), able to assure the containment of 48 patients and 24 convalescent patients. Penchaud chose this place essentially because of the main direction of the wind (mistral), expecting to dilute the presumed contagious entities (miasmas). It was first used for the quarantine of soldiers evacuated from African areas with yellow fever. It was then rehabilitated in 1850 by the health architect Jean-Marc Samuel Vaucher (1798-1877) to replace the Arenc Lazaret. The Caroline hospital was renamed \"Ratonneau\" after the name of the island and would become the Lazaret Island, the largest quarantine station and isolation hospital of the Mediterranean region [19] . At this time, 2 theories were erected concerning contagion: that transmission was due to contact between humans, justifying quarantine; and that of Lazaret and others, who considered transmission to be due to miasmas that were carried by the air and trapped in contaminated areas. In the Caroline Hospital, the 2 theories were combined: isolation of patients and natural air circulation. Contagious patients were cared for in a specially isolated area next to the entry of the hospital, avoiding unnecessary circulation within the building, while the convalescent patients were placed next to intendancy and administration, the nurses being located in between ( Figure 1A and 1B). It is particularly interesting to note that these principles of protection implemented at the time remain valid: isolation, containment, air as a vector of asepsis, and easy cleaning of the walls to evacuate the miasmas.",

All doors of the building including the patient's bedrooms are secured by an individual badge, allowing a specific control of access for IHU employees but also for visitors and for the patient's family. For example, access cards for visitors allow them to enter their patient's room only and in between 1 to 8 pm. The access control also permits the management of the entrance of isolation rooms. As for example, when in airborne precaution, visitors can access a patient's room only with a specific card given with protective mask; in the case of highly contagious disease or, more frequently, in cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), no access is allowed but intercom is available to ensure visitor exchange with their patient. Intelligent bedrooms include automatic continuous bedside monitoring system for hand hygiene [21] , bedside traceability of care by patient smart reader, a gown and glove distributor, and a house-made door notice enabling an enhanced security of care and reinforcing infection control for each patient [1] . Moreover, a specific biometric control allows access to the BSL3 laboratory complex.",

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) airborne pathogens such as TB should be cared for in negative air pressure bedrooms [17] . As a consequence, infectious diseases wards in IHU have been built as a suite of concentric circles with the health care worker (HCW) at the center, around the HWC pathway, around the patients in single rooms, and surrounding the unit, a visitor corridor with access limited to the patients if not in isolation (Figure 4 ). In front of each bedroom are masks, gloves, and coats in patented dispenser boxes. The entrance doors of the building have been equipped with infrared cameras to detect febrile persons and guide them to a specific zone of the consultation area to be cared for, allowing for a secure isolation in a dedicated part of the outpatient clinic for quick clinical investigation and diagnostics at the POC and eventually healthcare at the level 3 floor if contagious [23] ( Figure 5) . As an example of prevention of fomite transmission, smartphones as well as stethoscopes are covered by a protective film [24] .",

The third floor of the IHU MI building is dedicated to BSL3 activities with 1450 m 2 for BSL3 laboratories including a BSL3 necropsy room, and a 1300 m 2 BSL3 ward for healthcare including a BSL3 POC laboratory. The latter is dedicated to the care of contagious patients and has been built according to the most recent recommendations [13] [14] [15] . During routine care from a sanitary crisis, 25 single bedrooms can be used individually with negative pressure (-50 Pa) or positive pressure (+20 Pa) to care, for example, for patients with Beijing genotype or MDR-TB as well as immunocompromised patients with febrile neutropenia, but also to optimize the care for C. difficile colitis or emerging MDR bacterial infections. In case of sanitary crisis, the ward can be used as a modular BSL3 HLIU (8 + 7 + 10 beds) for patients with highly pathogenic microorganisms with secure anteroom access, a dedicated nurse room, autoclave, and POC laboratory ( Figure 5 ). Each room is equipped as stated above and with video surveillance. The whole building is Wi-Fi equipped, allowing communication for patients in long-term isolation. Specifically set for training infectious diseases HCW in infection control in hospitals, this unit is dedicated for all contagious patients.",
