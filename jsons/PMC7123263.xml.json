Two boys and one girl, Asian-looking from behind, were standing right in front of us by the door. Teachers were standing in the hallway by their classrooms. I was impressed by the children who learned to show their respect to the national anthem by standing still when they heard \u201cOh, Canada\u201d. My eyes were drawn to the colourful little hands on the wall to my left. It must be the shapes of real hands of children, for there were also names signed in those little hands. When the music stopped, there were announcements on the loudspeaker. People started moving around. We went inside the building. I saw four Chinese characters, \u4eb2\u5b50\u4e2d\u5fc3 Qin Zi Zhong Xin, on the door to my right. It was the Parent Centre. A Chinese grandpa was standing by the door. He told me that in the past there were only Cantonese-speaking children at the school but now there were more and more Mandarin speakers.\n",

I was disappointed when most parents and grandparents I met at the Parent Centre were from the villages of Guangdong (Canton) and Fujian, two coastal provinces in China that have had a long history of people seeking better life opportunities overseas. Most parents or grandparents spoke Cantonese and came to Canada in the category of \u201cFamily Reunion\u201d (CIC 2001, 2004). A few Mandarin-speaking parents were from Fujian, which was known to the public from the media for having \u201cboat people\u201d (Li 2001) coming to Canada or the United States illegally. They spoke Fujian dialects among themselves. Both Fujian dialects and Cantonese sounded like another language to me, so I felt foreign among the Chinese families who spoke Cantonese or Fujian dialects among themselves at the Parent Centre. Therefore, during my early visits, most of my conversations were with Carmen, the school staff member who worked with the families and children at the Parent Centre, and Freeman, a Chinese grandfather who had volunteered at the school, mostly at the Parent Centre, for more than 10 years.",

Therefore, I was looking for Chinese families who were well educated and well established in China in their life and career before they immigrated to Canada, and ideally who had children more than 10 years old. I believed that families belonging to this category would have developed a sophisticated understanding of the Chinese educational philosophy and values as well as the Chinese educational system. They would, I thought, be able to elaborate their views when comparing Eastern and Western educational systems. For months, I came back from the school telling Professor Connelly that I could not find the participants I wanted for my studies in the Parent Centre. I told him about Carmen\u2019s frustration and Freeman\u2019s concerns. I said I could not see these grandparents and parents as potential participants for my studies. Also, most of them did not have any higher education, and some had had little or no schooling experience in China.",

Mr. Anderson was busy yesterday afternoon so they changed the time to this afternoon. Around 1:30 p.m., Carmen called out, \u201cTidy up! Tidy up time!\u201d Several grandparents were talking on the couch. Michael\u2019s mother was putting puzzle pieces together with Michael on the carpet. Two boys were running across the room one after another. It was very noisy in the room. Nobody seemed to pay attention. Carmen looked around; then she asked Freeman to tell the parents to help tidy up. Freeman got up and went over to tell people in Cantonese and Mandarin that it was time to tidy up. The carpet was full of toys and puzzle pieces. I went to help and heard Michael asking his mom in Chinese, \u201cWhy should we tidy up now? It is not time, yet.\u201d Michael\u2019s mom told me that usually it was not the time yet to tidy up. They usually tidied up around 2 p.m. Children were used to the routine. They didn\u2019t know that today they had to tidy up earlier because the Buddy Reading Program was switched from yesterday to today.\nAt Circle Time, I noticed the grandparents and parents tried to follow Carmen when she was counting in English. They were trying to learn English from Carmen as she taught the little ones. Julian\u2019s grandma said she found Chinese actually more difficult to learn than English, as there were more complicated characters in Chinese. She said Julian didn\u2019t like to write Chinese words at home. He was a little bit naughty. I looked at Julian. He was playing with Danny. Danny hit Julian with his elbow. Julian hit back. \u201cNo, Julian!\u201d Julian\u2019s grandma said. Danny\u2019s grandma was sitting on the sofa watching without saying anything. Danny did not sit quietly like the other children who listened to Carmen when she started reading to them. Danny made a lot of noise. Carmen had to stop to discipline him. Yong Sheng and Yong Ming\u2019s mother got up to take Danny away from the circle and took him in her arms, trying to calm him down and keep him quiet\u2026.\n\u201cOK, let\u2019s do our last song. \u2018Twinkle, twinkle little star\u2026.\u2019\u201d\nYong Sheng and Yong Ming were singing loudly along with Carmen and following every movement Carmen made along with the song\u2026.\n",

She had different buckets to contain different toys, such as wild animals, farm animals, dinosaurs, fish, cars, little people, etc. She also sorted different colorful pieces according to their shapes or purposes. I didn\u2019t grow up with these toys, so I had to check with Carmen which pieces should go into which buckets or containers. It took us a long while to sort out all of the toys and put them into the right buckets or containers. Carmen said she would wash these toys once in a while to make sure they were clean for children to play with. Yong Sheng and Yong Ming, the two little brothers, were helping as well. Yong Sheng, the five-year-old boy, with tiny little glasses on his nose, looked very cute. He was a better helper to Carmen than me as he knew mostly where the right place was. For example, he knew where to put the baby stuff, and where to put the kitchen utensils. I didn\u2019t know, at first, that at the Parent Centre there was a baby\u2019s corner with toys particularly for babies and a tiny kitchen place for children to play with toy kitchen stuff. Yong Sheng was there helping Carmen all the time. Like myself, some parents tried to help but seemed to get lost and did not know how to help. Jeff\u2019s Grandpa helped a little while. But he looked confused. He didn\u2019t know which toy should go to which bucket, so he stopped.\nCarmen said it was really a lot of work for her at the Centre every day and she asked Freeman to tell the parents to help. I noticed someone was vacuuming the carpet and Yong Sheng and Yong Ming\u2019s mother was sweeping the room. Someone was doing the dishes\u2026.\n",

I helped her whenever I was there. As I had difficulties figuring out which piece should go to which container, I came to understand why many parents did not seem to help with toy sorting. I had been told to bite my tongue and not to give suggestions in the research field. So I did for many weeks, but eventually I suggested to Carmen that it might be a good idea to ask children to draw a picture of the toys and put them outside of each bucket so that parents would know which piece should go into which container. Carmen thought it was a good idea, so she glued some pieces outside each bucket. It helped, but not much. Parents and children still mixed them altogether without checking. One day before the Circle Time, when I was trying to figure out which bucket was for the toys in my hands, one mother said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t bother. The children will make a mess again in just one minute. We just put them away and make the room tidy for the Circle Time.\u201d Her hands were moving up and down very fast and putting away the toys from the carpet. In a minute she cleared the carpet for Circle Time. Still, Carmen repeated sorting out the toys every Wednesday afternoon. After many weeks, I could not help asking Carmen why she bothered to repeat this tedious work every week since the children would mess the toys all up in a minute. She said she thought it was important for children to be able to sort out things according to colors, shapes, purposes, or categories. The children would learn to make distinctions between colors, shapes, or categories and learn how to say the word for each toy. She thought it was also a way of learning skills that would be important in their lives; for example, to be well organized and tidy. Carmen said she did not grow up with some of the toys, but she used to work in a toyshop, so it was very easy for her. She understood it was difficult for parents to know exactly what was the right way to do it. \u201cThere is no right way. It is just my way.\u201d Carmen laughed. \u201cBecause I bought every single piece, so I have the idea where each one of them should go.\u201d I laughed and then remembered that the other day I had no idea that a red square shape with some white stripes on it should go to the bucket with farm animals until Carmen explained to me that the piece was a barn door and that was why she put it together with farm animals.",

She is consciously and unconsciously constructing and enacting a hidden curriculum that can be related to Dewey\u2019s (1938) notion of learning through direct experience. However, it is also because of that the Chinese grandparents/parents in the Parent Centre, who do not share the same lived experience as Carmen, did not seem to be able to make meaning of the weekly toy sorting as a learning process for their children intended by Carmen in her \u201chidden curriculum\u201d (King 1986; Jackson 1992).",

By living in their stories, I am able to see people with a narrative perspective and in their own terms, not as what I thought they were in my mind, or what I was told they were in others\u2019 stories. Rather than complaining that I could not find the right people as participants for my studies, I found that every person I met and every conversation we had constitutes a fascinating narrative with significant educational values. With the sense of inquiry I acquired in my lived experience with my participants moving in and out of the school landscapes in transition, I see what I see and hear what I hear with a narrative perspective instead of seeing what I think or believe what I see or hearing what I think or believe what I hear. That is, by living in the midst of stories, I start to see an event as an expression of something happening over time, instead of thinking of it as a thing happening at that moment.",

The following stories about \u201cthe granny with a doggie bag\u201d, interwoven one after another, reveal the complex multigenerational relationships in which the granny lived: she had been an indispensable caregiver to Danny\u2019s father, her grandson, and she was then a caregiver both to Danny, her great grandson, and to her granddaughter Daphne, her daughter\u2019s daughter at the Parent Centre. These otherwise untold stories about the granny reveal the complexity and multiplicity of stories embedded in the multiple dimensions of people\u2019s life.",

            "text": "\nOne and a half years since I first walked into the Parent Centre, a place of stories, many children had reached school age. Yong Sheng and Danny became Grade-1 students in September. I still saw Yong Ming and Julian in the Parent Centre as they would go to kindergarten for a half day in the morning and come to the Parent Centre in the afternoon. Danny\u2019s great grandmother, one of the grandmothers who were seen putting snacks into a doggie bag, now came to the Parent Centre with her granddaughter Daphne, her daughter\u2019s daughter. Several times, while at the Parent Centre, I saw the granny teaching her granddaughter Daphne to read and write Chinese. I was amazed at her beautiful Chinese handwriting. Julian\u2019s grandma said that the granny was born into a rich family. I wondered if she had attended a private school as daughters of some rich families in China did in the old days before girls were allowed to attend schools. \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t go to school\u201d, Julian\u2019s grandma said. \u201cHow did she learn to read and write then?\u201d Julian\u2019s grandma shook her head. The granny seldom talked. She was either attending to Daphne or sitting there lost in her own thoughts. She often dozed off in the tiny chair beside Daphne. During the Circle Time, she moved to the couch with Daphne, sitting in front of her. She fell asleep when Carmen started singing with the children. The granny spoke only a sub-dialect of Cantonese which only a few other grandmothers could understand. Her life remained as fragmented stories to us. A mother told me that Danny was actually the granny\u2019s great grandson. She brought up her grandson, Danny\u2019s father, and now, in her 80 s, she is taking care of Danny, the great grandson, while also looking after the housework for the family. Daphne, the granny\u2019s daughter\u2019s daughter, often fell asleep during the Circle Time. The granny carried her in her arms. Looking at the 80-year-old granny with her 3-year-old granddaughter in her arms, I wondered what miraculous energy burst out of her tiny aged body that was often bent at a 90-degree angle.\nOne afternoon, I walked into the Parent Centre, and saw quite a few grandmothers and mothers sitting around the big table talking. They said hello to me but all looked solemn. I noticed that the granny was sitting among them. Half of her right cheek was black and blue. The granny looked sad and confused. The grandmothers and mothers listened and sighed. One grandmother who could speak Mandarin told me the story. The granny was hit by Danny, her great grandson. No one knew what exactly had happened. One fragment of the granny\u2019s story, somewhat related to the granny\u2019s black-and-blue cheek, was that Danny\u2019s mother, the granny\u2019s granddaughter in-law, often blamed the granny for eating too much. She often complained to the granny that she did not understand why the granny at her age still ate so much. The granny came to the dinner table often to see only leftovers from the family after she finished the housework. All the grandmothers and mothers sighed with the granny. Yong Sheng\u2019s mother said angrily that she knew that woman. Over one year ago, Danny had a serious skin allergy. Carmen asked him to stay at home in her concern about other children in the room. Danny\u2019s mother came to the Parent Centre shouting at Carmen. Freeman tried to explain on behalf of Carmen. Danny\u2019s mother turned around, shouting at Freeman. I remembered Freeman had told me the same story a while ago.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t the granny go to live with her daughter?\u201d I looked at the deep wrinkles in the granny\u2019s saddened face, wondering what stories each of those wrinkles would tell about the granny\u2019s life. Yong Sheng\u2019s mother said that the granny\u2019s eldest son, Danny\u2019s grandfather, had a good business at home in China. He asked the granny to go back home to Guangdong, but the granny would not listen. She brought up Danny\u2019s father and she is now taking care of Danny, her great grandson. It looked as if she felt Danny\u2019s family could not do without her.\nThe week before Christmas, the granny came into the Parent Centre with two grandchildren who came to visit her from Paris where another daughter of hers lived. All the wrinkles on her face expanded comfortably like a fully blooming chrysanthemum.\nNo one knew exactly why the granny chose to stay with Danny\u2019s family even though she seemed to be so mistreated while she had many better choices.\n",

These intersecting narratives of people\u2019s diverse lived experiences are no longer simply storytelling of an event. They tell people\u2019s diverse lives from the past to the present across cultural and spatial borders on landscapes in transition. They tell both personal and social dimensions of people\u2019s lived experiences from the past to the present, the transition and interactions of people\u2019s lives across social and cultural boundaries, their adaptation and frustration in their life on landscapes in transition, and their values, traditions, and habits that they hold on to or let go. Above all, the intersecting narratives of people from diverse cultural narratives on landscapes in transition reveal the multiplicity and complexity of narrative and storytelling. Accordingly, in narrative educational studies, it is important to develop a sense of inquiry into people\u2019s storied life by living in the midst of stories temporally, personally, socially, and spatially. Living in the midst of stories with a sense of inquiry enables a narrative inquirer to consciously and unconsciously narrativize fragmented stories of people\u2019s life and to understand narratively the continuity and wholeness of an individual\u2019s life experience in narrative unities and discontinuities.",

According to Connelly and Clandinin (1990, 2000), narrative is both the phenomenon and the method in the social sciences because experience is what narrative inquirers study and narrative thinking is a key form of experience and a key way of writing and thinking about it. Narrative inquiry as a methodology derives its strength from narrative inquiry as phenomenon in which story is the phenomenon and narrative is the inquiry (Connelly 2001; Connelly and Clandinin 1990). Using this narrative approach, I have double agendas in my inquiry. On one hand, I present Chinese families\u2019 lived experience on cross-cultural landscapes of schools in transition, the phenomenon under study: 10.1007/978-3-319-46103-8_3 through 10.1007/978-3-319-46103-8_7, in narrative form, are structured in episodes and scenes. On the other hand, I try to bridge cultures not only between the East and the West, but also between the culture of the reader and the narrative culture of the text in a narrative inquiry sense. Hence, in the following chapters I present the core family stories in the way life they evolved during my inquiry journey. I would like to invite you to read the episodes of these Chinese families\u2019 lived experience in their own terms. The family stories are, to a certain extent, inter-related and embedded in one another. I hope to accomplish my double agenda in the inquiry journey: the inquiry into the stories of /about my participants; and, the inquiry into the narrative process of my thinking and understanding of the phenomenon under study.",
