            "text": "Bioactive lipids can induce leakage and lysis of microbial cell membranes, disrupt viral protein envelopes, inhibit respiratory activity, interfere with transportation of amino acids, and uncouple oxidative phosphorylation (7, 8, 9, 10). Alveolar macrophages, leukocytes, T and B cells, NK cells and other immunocytes can release AA and other unsaturated fatty acids to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), SARS and MERS, which are all enveloped viruses. It is possible that the ability of immunocytes to release bioactive lipids could be one of the fundamental innate immune response mechanisms needed to protect from various infections. Thus, failure of these immunocytes to secrete adequate amounts of bioactive lipids to inactivate various microbes including Coronary virus (COVID-19) may render a person more susceptible to infection. It has been shown that alveolar macrophages and other immunocytes in the lungs release bioactive lipids into the alveolar fluid and surrounding tissues to bring about their antimicrobial action (11,12). In this context, the work of Juers JA, et al. (12) in noteworthy. It was reported that alveolar macrophages do not kill in vitro unless the microorganisms have been incubated with alveolar lining material before phagocytosis. The factor that enhanced the microbicidal capacity of alveolar macrophages was found to be present in the lipid fraction of the alveolar lining material, which could be one of the bioactive lipids. These results imply that there is a close interaction/crosstalk between alveolar lining material and alveolar macrophages. This is further supported by the observation that activated macrophages release bioactive lipid to kill tumor cells (13).",

It is noteworthy that NK cells and CTLs induce apoptosis of tumor cells even when perforin, granzyme pathway is inactivated and is dependent on the expression of soluble phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) (14). This suggests that one additional mechanism by which NK cells and CTLs, even if do not secrete perforin and granzyme, induce apoptosis of tumor cells and those that harbor intracellular microbes is by activating sPLA2. It is likely that perforin and granzyme may have the ability to activate sPLA2 that needs to be established. But what is certain is the fact that PLD (phospholipase D) activation is necessary in the CD16-triggered signaling cascade that leads to NK cytotoxic granule exocytosis that, in turn, is associated with AA release (15, 16, 17). In this context, it is interesting to note that lipids are a constitutive component of cytolytic granules of CTL, NK and \u03b3\u03b4T cells (18) and cytokine activated macrophages release bioactive lipids to induce apoptosis of tumor cells (13,19, 20, 21).",

            "text": "To exhibit their functions adequately, macrophages need cooperation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells both for pathogen sensing and rapid protection of barrier tissues, a function that is reminiscent of what is described by Juers JA, et al. (12) on the close interaction/crosstalk between alveolar lining material and alveolar macrophages for the latter (macrophages) to bring about their ability to eliminate invading microbes and tumor cells. Thus, there is close cooperation not only between epithelial cells and macrophages but also between macrophages and other T cells. This close association among various tissue epithelial and other cells, macrophages and tissue resident T cells (that are needed for local immune response) seem to depend on their (mainly tissue resident memory T cells) ability to uptake fatty acids for their survival from the local tissues/cells that is regulated by the type of fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) expressed by the T cells. It was reported that tissue resident memory T cells show varying patterns of FABP isoform usage that are determined by tissue-derived factors. It appears that tissue resident memory T cells (and possibly other immunocytes including macrophages) modify their FABP expression depending on the tissue in which they are located or relocated. Thus, tissue resident memory T cells when relocated to different organs modify their FABP expression in line with their new location implying that each tissue resident memory T cells have or need a specific pattern of fatty acids both for their survival and action (22). This interesting observation also argues in favor of the suggestion that each tissue and their resident memory T cells (and macrophages and other immunocytes) need a specific type of bioactive lipid to bring about their action tailored to their location and hence, the necessity of different types of bioactive lipids. This argument can be extended to suggest that, possibly, to inactivate a specific type of bacteria, fungi or virus a specific type or types of bioactive lipid(s) is needed depending on the tissue involved and microbe invading the tissues.",

Hence, in instances where there is substantial degree of inflammation due to high levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (as it may happen in COVID-19) it may lead to a deficiency of AA, EPA and DHA and decreased generation of LXA4, resolvins, protectins and maresins due to their precursor deficiency. AA, EPA, DHA, LXA4, resolvins, protectins and maresins are potent suppressors of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 formation. Thus, there appears to be a delicate balance maintained between PUFAs and their metabolites and pro-inflammatory cytokines (7).

            "text": "AA is the precursor of both prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and LXA4. In general, it is believed that PGE2 is pro-inflammatory whereas LXA4 is an anti-inflammatory molecule. But, under some very specific conditions PGE2 shows anti-inflammatory actions and is highly beneficial (29,36,37). This anti-inflammatory action of PGE2 seems to depend on its ability to enhance LXA4 formation (29). This suggests that once the inflammation reaches a peak in which PGE2 plays a significant role, the metabolism of AA is redirected to form LXA4 instead of PGE2 indicating a crosstalk between PGE2 and LXA4. This switching of AA metabolism from PGE2 to LXA4 (and probably vice versa, if need be) appears to be a crucial event in the resolution of inflammation in which anti-inflammatory cytokines play a role (34). In this context, it is interesting to note that 15-PGDH\u2013(15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase, a prostaglandin degrading enzyme) deficient mice showed a twofold increase in PGE2 levels in several tissues including bone marrow, colon, and liver, increased fitness of these tissues with enhanced hematopoietic capacity. These 15-PGDH deficient animals not only had rapid liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy but also showed accelerated recovery of neutrophils, platelets, and erythrocytes (38). These results are supported by other studies which showed that PGE2 regulates haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis, promotes wound healing and tissue regeneration and modulates stem cell trafficking, events that ultimately promote hematopoiesis (39, 40, 41, 42). These evidences suggest that administration of AA and other bioactive lipids to those with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, who may develop fulminant activation of coagulation, resulting in widespread microvascular thrombosis and consumption of coagulation factors as evidenced by thrombocytopenia, prolongation of the PT/INR, PTT, elevation of D-dimer, and decreased fibrinogen levels, may show early recovery due to increased formation of PGE2 (from AA).",

Previously, we showed that plasma levels of AA and other bioactive lipid shave been shown to be low in diabetes mellitus, hypertension and coronary heart disease (43) and plasma LXA4 levels, a potent anti-inflammatory bioactive lipid, fall with age (44) that may explain adverse outcome in them. Furthermore, it has been shown that it is safe to administer GLA and AA intravenously (45) and oral supplementation of AA enhances LXA4 formation with little or no change in PGE2 formation (that shifts the balance more towards anti-inflammatory events) without increasing the severity of underlying condition with no adverse events (46, 47, 48). Previously, we showed that bioactive lipids (especially AA) have cytoprotective actions against many chemicals, prevents both alloxan and streptozotocin-induced apoptosis of pancreatic \u03b2 cells and ameliorate development of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus that is associated with suppression of inflammation and increase in the formation of LXA4 (49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55).",

ACE2 may play a role in regulating cardiovascular and renal functions and fertility. ACE2 is a suppressor of renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE catalyzes angiotensin I (AngI) to convert to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (AngII), whereas ACE2 cleaves Ang I to produce inactive angiotensin 1-9 peptide (Ang 1-9). Ang 1-9 is converted to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) by ACE. ACE2 hydrolyzes AngII to Ang (1-7), and the efficiency of hydrolyzing AngII is 400 times than that of AngI. It suggests that ACE2 mainly generates Ang 1-7 by hydrolyzing AngII. Furthermore, Ang 1-7 acts on the Mas receptor to exert cardiovascular protection of diastolic blood vessels, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferation, anti-fibrosis, anti-alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis, and anti-oxidative stress, thereby antagonizing the biological effects of Ang II. The ACE/Ang\u2161/AT1R axis and the ACE2/Ang 1-7/MAS axis balance each other.",
