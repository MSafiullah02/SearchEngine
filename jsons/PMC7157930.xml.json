Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly emergent member in the family Coronaviridae that cause a severe infectious respiratory disease. SARS-CoV is distinct from previously characterized groups of coronaviruses [1], [2], and unlike other human coronaviruses whose infections are usually very mild, SARS-CoV produced mortality rates as high as 10% but increased to greater than 50% in persons older than age 60 [3]. At present there is no vaccine available against any human coronavirus infection, and although SARS-CoV has been successfully restrained, re-emergence from animal reservoirs is still a potential risk for future recurrences [4].",

            "text": "SARS-CoV infection, similarly to other envelope viruses, is achieved through fusion of the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane [5], [6], although recent studies have shown that the entry may be also pH-dependent [7]. The spike glycoprotein S is a surface class I viral fusion glycoprotein that mediates viral entry by binding to the cellular receptor and induces membrane fusion. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain, whereas the S2 is responsible for the fusion between the viral and cellular membranes [2], [8]. S2 contains two highly conserved heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2, see Fig. 1A) [9], [10], [11], similarly to other viral Class I fusion proteins, including HIV-1 gp41, influenza hemagglutinin HA2, Ebola virus glycoprotein and paramyxovirus F protein [12], [13]. All of them have been classified as Class I transmembrane glycoproteins and are displayed on the surface of the viral membrane as oligomers. Class I viral proteins also contain a hydrophobic region denominated as the fusion peptide (FP) and other hydrophobic region immediately adjacent to the membrane-spanning domain denominated as the pre-transmembrane domain (PTM). Computer sequence predictions and systematic amino acid mapping studies of the S2 domain have located the HR1 region to amino acids approximately from 892 to 972, while the HR2 region extends approximately from amino acids 1142 to 1184 [2], [10], [11], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Binding of the S1 subunit to the receptor is thought to trigger a series of conformational changes in S2 that brings, via the formation of an antiparallel heterotrimeric six-helix bundle by the two HR regions, the putative fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain in close proximity. These structural rearrangements in the S protein generate the energy that drives the fusion of the viral and cellular lipid membrane.",

            "text": "Although it was initially believed that viral fusion glycoproteins interacted with the membrane solely by means of the FP, different regions of the viral envelope glycoproteins are essential for membrane fusion to occur [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. These membrane-interacting regions are capable of modifying the biophysical properties of phospholipid membranes, suggesting that several segments may have an important role in the fusion process [18], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. While much progress has been made in understanding the implication of fusion peptides of influenza, HIV and other viruses in fusion, available data concerning the fusion peptide of coronaviruses, particularly in the case of SARS-CoV, are scarce. It has been predicted that the sequence comprising residues from 858 to 886 of the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein is the FP domain since it has strong membrane-perturbing capacities [14], [32], and furthermore mutations in this region cause inhibition of S-mediated cell fusion by more than 70% [33]. However, recent studies have shown that the region comprising residues 770 to 788 has a much more potent fusogenic activity than the former sequence and suggested to constitute the fusion peptide of the S2 glycoprotein [34]. The importance of PTM segments on the mechanism of viral entry has also been demonstrated in the membrane fusion proteins of HIV, FIV, Ebola virus, HSV and VSV through the use of site-directed mutagenesis and the study of the interaction of synthetic peptides with membranes [24], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Similar observations suggest that the PTM domain of SARS-CoV may also play an essential role in virus entry [32], [44], [45], [46]. Upon triggering, the N-terminal fusion peptide region (comprised by amino acid residues 770 to 788) might be the first one to acquire the competence to bind to and insert into the membrane, whereas the region comprised by amino acids 858 to 886 (internal fusion peptide) might be fundamental for subsequent steps of the fusion process because it would become located adjacent to the transmembrane domain after the necessary rearrangements that give rise to the formation of the six-helix coiled-coil bundle [47].",

Elucidating the nature of the interactions between phospholipid and membrane proteins is essential for the understanding of the structure and function of the implicated molecules, clarifying the specific roles of specific types of phospholipids in biological membranes. Based on our work [32], [46], [48] we have selected three specific sequences from the SARS-CoV S2 sequence (Fig. 1), i.e., SARSFP, comprised by amino acid residues 770 to 788 and corresponding to the putative fusion peptide of the protein, SARSIFP, comprised by amino acid residues 873 to 888 and corresponding to the suggested internal fusion peptide, and SARSPTM, comprised by amino acid residues 1185 to 1202 and corresponding to the PTM domain of the protein. Here, we explore the monolayer penetration of these peptides, their capacity to insert into the membrane as well as the perturbation of the dipole potential of the bilayer. Moreover, we show through experiments using equimolar mixtures of these peptides that they might be involved in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes working synergistically in the native protein.",

This ratio reflects the changes in the total membrane dipole potential moment, as they cause a shift in the excitation spectrum maximum of di-8-ANEPPS. By exciting the membrane suspensions at two different wavelengths corresponding to the maximum and the minimum of the difference spectrum, a fluorescence intensity ratio R can be calculated, which can be used as a measure of the relative changes in the magnitude of the dipole potential. The fluorescence ratio R is defined as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at an excitation wavelength of 450 nm divided by that at 520 nm.

Interestingly, there was a different behavior of the different peptides depending on the lipid composition of the monolayers. Peptide SARSPTM is highly surface active and was intercalated effectively in all four different lipidic compositions (Fig. 2A). However, the overall charge of the lipid monolayer played a significant role in peptide insertion, since we observed an increase in \u03c0\nc from 35 mN/m for POPC monolayers to 45 mN/m for POPC/POPG monolayers. The presence of either ESM or CHOL reduced the intercalation of the SARSPTM peptide, since \u03c0\nc decreased to 31 and 30 mN/m, respectively in the presence of these lipids. In contrast to SARSPTM, the increment in the surface pressure at low \u03c0\n0 was different for SARSFP (Fig. 2B). Whereas the maximum \u0394\u03c0 varied between 25 and 31 mN/m for the SARSPTM peptide, the values measured for the SARSFP peptide varied between 15 and 21 mN/m, suggesting a more shallow location of the latter peptide. The presence of a negatively-charged phospholipid induced a similar effect as observed for SARSPTM, \u03c0\nc increasing from 32 mN/m to 41 mN/m. Similarly, the presence of either ESM or CHOL reduced \u03c0\nc from 32 mN/m to about 25 mN/m (Table 1). In the case of the SARSIFP peptide, the maximum \u0394\u03c0 values were similar to those found for SARSFP, but the dependence of \u03c0\nc on monolayer composition was very different (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, SARSIFP readily intercalated into POPC monolayers with a \u03c0\nc value of 40 mN/m, but the presence of POPG diminished its insertion, displaying a \u03c0\nc value of approximately 26 mN/m. Interestingly, the presence of CHOL abolished completely the insertion of the SARSIFP peptide, since the \u03c0\nc value observed was about 16 mN/m. However, the presence of both ESM and CHOL increased \u03c0\nc to 29 mN/m.",

            "text": "As it was commented previously, and in the context of the membrane fusion mechanism elicited by SARS-CoV envelope glycoprotein S, the concerted action of several membrane-interacting domains may have an essential role in facilitating it. Moreover, after the rearrangements of the protein to form the six-helix coiled-coil bundle, some of them would be adjacent to each other and therefore interact together. Consequently, we also analyzed the insertion of equimolar combinations of the three former peptides in monolayers having different compositions. The insertion of an equimolar combination of SARSFP plus SARSPTM in monolayers of different compositions is showed in Fig. 2D. As expected, the increment in surface pressure at low \u03c0\n0 was centered between the maxima observed with both peptides alone. However, depending on lipid composition some differences were observed compared to the data shown above using single peptides. For POPC monolayers, \u03c0\nc was 40 mN/m, in contrast with a predicted value of about 33 mN/m, when assuming an independent effect for each of the peptides (Table 1). In the case of the mixture POPC/POPG, the experimental \u03c0\nc was 36 mN/m, significantly lower than the predicted one of about 43 mN/m. In the presence of mixtures containing ESM or CHOL, the \u03c0\nc values were slightly decreased when compared with pure POPC (35 mN/m and 32 mN/m, respectively). The mixture containing ESM alone did yield a \u03c0\nc of about 38 mN/m, i.e., in between POPC and POPC/ESM/CHOL (Table 1). The insertion into monolayers of an equimolar combination of SARSFP plus SARSIFP is shown in Fig. 2D. The \u03c0\nc values in POPC and POPC/POPG monolayers were similar to the predicted ones, i.e., 36 mN/m and 30 mN/m (Table 1). The inclusion of CHOL in POPC gave place to a \u03c0\nc value of 26 mN/m, greater than the predicted one. However, the inclusion of ESM in POPC did not induce any difference in \u03c0\nc when compared with pure POPC. However, the inclusion of both ESM and CHOL promoted a strong increase in \u03c0\nc (43 mN/m). In this case, the \u0394\u03c0 value at low \u03c0\n0 was less pronounced than that observed in the other lipids suggesting a shallow penetration of the peptides in the monolayer. The insertion of an equimolar combination of SARSPTM plus SARSIFP in monolayers is showed in Fig. 2F (see Table 1). In POPC and POPC/POPG monolayers, the \u03c0\nc values were lower than the predicted ones (32 mN/m and 28 mN/m, respectively). However, the presence of either ESM or CHOL to POPC gave place to \u03c0\nc values significantly increased if compared with the predicted ones (40 mN/M, 28 mN/M and 35 mN/M for POPC/ESM/CHOL, POPC/CHOL and POPC/ESM, respectively).",

The variation of the fluorescence intensity ratio R\n450/520 normalized as a function of the peptide concentration for different membrane compositions is shown in Fig. 3\n. In the presence of the SARSPTM peptide a great decrease in the R\n450/520 value was measured in the presence of the three mixtures tested, being slightly higher in the presence of POPC/POPG than in the POPC and POPC/ESM/CHOL samples (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the former peptide, SARSIFP had no significant effect on the membrane dipole potential (Fig. 3B), suggesting that this peptide, despite being inserted in monolayers, is not able to insert sufficiently in order to perturb the membrane potential, or inserts in a way causing minimal alteration in the dipole potential. For SARSFP, the change of dipole potential is less pronounced than that caused by SARSPTM (Fig. 3C), suggesting a shallow position of SARSFP in the membrane, in accordance with the monolayer data shown above. However, the dependence on lipid composition is significantly more pronounced than seen for SARSPTM. In the presence of membranes composed of POPC/POPG, the membrane potential underwent a strong perturbation by the peptide, whereas for pure POPC was smaller and quite insignificant in the case of POPC/ESM/CHOL (Fig. 3C).",

For the mixture of the SARSFP and SARSIFP peptides, a slight decrease of R is seen for all the samples (Fig. 3E). Finally, we analyzed the effect of an equimolar mixture of SARSIFP and SARSPTM on the membrane dipole potential as shown in Fig. 3F. In this case, the decrease in the R value was significant, taking into account that SARSPTM but not SARSIFP had a significant effect on the dipole potential of the different membranes tested.

The quenching data are presented in Fig. 4\nand the Stern\u2013Volmer quenching constants shown in Table 2\n. The linear Stern\u2013Volmer plots with a unitary intercept indicate that the Trp residues are fairly accessible to acrylamide, and in all cases, the quenching showed an acrylamide dependent concentration behavior, so that the Stern\u2013Volmer dynamic quenching formalism describes accurately the data. It is necessary to mention here that the SARSPTM peptide has three Trp residues, and the SARSFP peptide has a Trp residue. SARSIFP was used in its wild type form, i.e., without Trp residues, because it is only necessary for one peptide in the mixture to obtain relevant fluorescence data. The quenching data for the SARSPTM peptide is presented in Fig. 4A and the resultant Stern\u2013Volmer plots reveal that in aqueous solution the Trp residues were highly exposed to the solvent that led to a more efficient quenching. However, in the presence of model membranes, the extent of quenching was significantly reduced, indicating a poor accessibility of the Trp residues to the aqueous phase, consistent with the incorporation of the SARSPTM peptide into the lipid bilayer. Interestingly, the K\nSV values were similar showing no preference for any one of the lipid compositions used (Table 2). In contrast, and in the presence of SARSFP, different K\nSV values were measured, being lowest for the POPC/POPG liposomes (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that the Trp of the SARSFP peptide is less exposed to the aqueous solvent in the presence of membranes containing negatively-charged phospholipids than the other mixtures (Table 2), in accordance with the monolayer and membrane potential experiments shown above.",

The solution K\nSV value of the SARSFP and SARSIFP mixture is slightly lower than that found for SARSFP, suggesting an interaction between the peptides but to a lesser extent than that found for the former mixture.

All the three combinations were squeezed-out from the interface at a similar surface pressure, i.e., about 43\u201348 mN/m, as shown by the convergence of the lipid/peptide isotherms with the isotherm of the pure lipid sample. It can be also observed that the peptide interaction with the POPC/ESM/CHOL mixture is more efficient since they cause a larger increase of the surface area per molecule. For example, at a surface pressure of 10 mN/m, \u0394A, the difference in area per molecule in the absence and in the presence of the peptides, was 24.4, 29 and 32.8\u00c52 per molecule in POPC monolayers but it increased to 30.8, 38.7 and 44.4 \u00c52 per lipid molecule in POPC/ESM/CHOL monolayers for the equimolar mixtures of SARSIFP\n + SARSPTM, SARSIFP\n + SARSFP and SARSPTM\n + SARSFP, respectively.",

The viral fusion protein of SARS-CoV is the envelope Spike glycoprotein and the domain responsible of the fusion is the S2 domain. Until recently, it has been thought that the N-terminal fusion peptide was the main region interacting with and inserting into the target cell membrane inducing fusion of the lipid bilayers. However, recent studies point to the fact that there are several regions within Class I and Class II membrane fusion proteins which are involved in the interaction with the membrane to accomplish the fusion process [20], [25], [26], [57]. Although in other Class I fusion proteins plentiful data have been obtained to understand the implication of these membrane-interacting segments in the fusion mechanism, available information concerning the possible membrane-active regions in coronavirus, and particularly in the case of SARS-CoV, is scarce. Recent studies have identified three membranotropic regions in the S2 domain of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, one situated downstream of the minimum furin cleavage, which is considered the fusion peptide (SARSFP), an internal putative fusion peptide helper for the fusion peptide located immediately upstream of the HR1 region (SARSIFP) and the pre-transmembrane domain (SARSPTM) [32], [34], [45], [46], [48]. To test the hypothesis that these regions of the S2 protein may cooperatively interact in the native protein to create a fusion pore or destabilize the membrane, we have analyzed the monolayer insertion, change in membrane potential, peptide accessibility and compression isotherms of equimolar mixtures of the three synthetic peptides mentioned above. We report that synthetic peptides corresponding to these three membrane-interacting segments might interact with and insert into the bilayer as well as they can interact between them.",

SARSPTM and SARSFP peptides insert into lipid monolayers and their intercalation is enhanced by the presence of the negatively-charged phospholipid, POPG. Moreover, inclusion of CHOL to the lipid monolayer decreases the SARSFP and SARSPTM intercalation into lipid monolayers. Nevertheless, SARSPTM had a different behavior to SARSFP decreasing the dipole membrane potential. Whereas the change in the membrane potential was nearly independent of phospholipid composition for SARSPTM, the dependence on negatively-charged phospholipids is stronger in the SARSFP peptide since the decrease in the dipole potential of the membrane was more noticeable in POPG containing LUVs. Furthermore, addition of ESM and CHOL reduces even more the change in membrane potential caused by SARSFP. SARSIFP has also a different behavior depending on lipid composition. SARSIFP penetrates more easily into POPC than into POPG and CHOL containing monolayers. However, the presence of both CHOL and ESM abolished completely the intercalation of the peptide into the monolayer. In the case of the peptide equimolar mixtures, we can observe that the presence of both ESM and CHOL, components which mimic lipidic rafts, induce a greater insertion, particularly in the case of SARSPTM plus SARSIFP and SARSIFP plus SARSFP mixtures. A similar effect is observed in the membrane dipole potential measurements. However, the cooperation of SARSPTM and SARSIFP to change the membrane potential occurs in all phospholipidic mixtures but the synergistic effect of the other two mixtures is more marked in LUVs mimicking lipidic rafts.",

Despite this fact it is possible to obtain information of these experiments. For the SARSPTM and SARSFP equimolar mixture, similar low K\nSV values were observed in the three different LUV compositions used despite the strong dependence on negative charged phospholipids observed for SARSFP alone. So, SARSFP in combination with SARSPTM, might insert deeper into the membrane. However, it cannot be discarded that fluorescence of SARSPTM predominate in the mixture owing to its higher quantum yield. Lower K\nSV values for the mixture SARSPTM and SARSIFP compared with those observed for the single peptides indicate a significant interaction between the peptides in solution. In the SARSFP plus SARSIFP mixture, the lower K\nSV is observed in POPG, similarly to what was observed in SARSFP alone, so that SARSIFP does not seem to affect the accessibility of SARSFP. Some type of interaction between SARSFP and SARSIFP is possible since the K\nSV value is lower for the peptide mixture than for SARSFP alone, but not in the same extent that SARSPTM and SARSIFP. Lastly, although the K\nSV values for the SARSPTM and SARSIFP mixture are similar to those observed for the SARSPTM, in the case of LUVs mimicking rafts the K\nSV is significant lower, which would indicate a synergistic action of these peptides in order to perturb and insert into this type of membrane.",

So, it would be expected a similar influence of negatively-charged phospholipids on the membrane interaction of the peptides. However, this is not the case and different results are obtained suggesting that not only charge but hydrophobic interactions are taking place and giving place to the differences found. Taking into account the above mentioned experiments as well as previously published data [46], SARSPTM interaction with the membrane is not significantly dependent on the presence of negatively-charged phospholipids, in contrast to SARSFP\n[48]; however, both peptides would be embedded deeply into the membrane. SARSIFP is also able to bind membranes but it would be located in a shallow position at the membrane surface, perhaps prevented from inserting by the presence of negatively-charged phospholipids. Moreover, we have shown the existence of direct peptide\u2013peptide interactions in solution between the SARSPTM and SARSFP peptides. Although it should be taken into account that the synergism we have found might be different in the intact protein or might even not exist, the experimental data described in this work would point to a possible interaction in the pre-fusion state, as it has been already shown in the case of HIV [58], [59]. In this last case, it has been reported the formation of a complex between similar domains in the gp41 pre-fusion state acting as a kinetic trap to halt fusion. There is also ample data suggesting that in the case of HIV membrane fusion starts before the collapse of the six-helix bundle [60]. The mechanism of SARS seems to be similar in some aspects and it might behave in the same way. In Fig. 6\nwe present a hypothetical model of SARS-CoV fusion based on available data [32], [34], [45], [46], [47]. In this model, the FP would insert into the host cell, it would be followed by the formation of the pre-hairpin intermediate, and afterwards the core formed by the HR1 and HR2 would be refolded into the six-helix bundle. Subsequently hemifusion would be induced, this process being facilitated by the juxtaposition of the IFP and PTM domains. These two regions could also facilitate the formation of the fusion pore through lipid destabilization in the late steps of the membrane fusion process. The interaction between the IFP and the PTM would be one of the most important steps of this process.",

In this way, in SARS-CoV, SARSPTM and SARSFP might be forming a complex in the pre-fusion state: just after exposing the fusion peptide and its insertion into the host membrane, the formation of the six-helix bundle would bring into close proximity the region immediately upstream of HR1 (SARSIFP) and the pre-transmembrane domain (SARSPTM). They would find the appropriate platform in the existent lipid rafts to facilitate their interaction, and therefore facilitating the membrane fusion process. Lipid rafts are functional membrane microdomains where sphingolipids, cholesterol and associated proteins are enriched. They have been shown to play a crucial role in many biological events requiring the integrity of raft microdomains [61], [62]. In addition, many viruses often use lipid rafts as a site for entry, assembly and budding. Lipid rafts have been reported to be implicated in the entry process of HIV [63], Semliki Forest virus [64] and simian virus 40 [65]. In the case of coronavirus, there also some evidence that lipid rafts are involved in virus entry [66], [67]. Recent studies have reported that lipid rafts are involved in SARS-CoV entry into cells, although it is not clear if ACE2 directly localize in rafts or not. Therefore, it has been proposed that some unknown factors involved in virus entry may localize to lipid rafts [7]. In the present work, we have showed that some regions of the SARS-CoV S2 glycoprotein, mainly SARSPTM and SARSIFP, can have a different interaction with lipid rafts. Consequently, lipid rafts might serve as a platform for several regions in native spike glycoprotein to interact and facilitate the membrane fusion process. In this way, lipid rafts induce and modulate the joining of components of the membrane docking and fusion machinery making possible their intermolecular interactions by proximity [68], [69].",
