Species B includes two genetic clusters, subspecies B1 and B2. B1 subspecies (including HAdV-3, HAdV-7, HAdV-16, HAdV-21, and HAdV-50) usually cause acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), while B2 subspecies (including HAdV-11, HAdV-14, HAdV-34, and HAdV-35) are more often associated with urinary tract infections and opportunistic infections in immune-compromised hosts, except HAdV-14 (which is a respiratory pathogen).2\n",

The species classification is closely associated with differences in the affected human organs (tropism). Within each species, serotypes are distinguished based on their reactivity in the virus neutralization assay. This reactivity is mainly due to antibodies to the major capsid protein, the hexon, but also to antibodies to the penton base and fiber protein. Presently, 51 HAdV serotypes have been recognized. Within many serotypes, variants have been defined by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA.15\n",

These usually arise in military training facilities and crowded population groups. One of the risk factors for this severe illness may be the crowding and increased physical and psychological stress. In the present study, we report another HAdV-B55 outbreak in a physical training facility in Tianjin, China. In this outbreak, five of 19 cases had severe pneumonia and had to be hospitalized. All five cases were young males with no underlying diseases. A recent report has shown that HAdV may lead to community-acquired pneumonia in children less than 10 years of age.16 Surveillance for HAdV in both children and adults should be enhanced.",

The identities of the fiber and hexon genes from HAdV isolated in this outbreak were 100%, and the absence of any other relevant pathogen suggests that this virus was responsible for the outbreak. To allow for the determination of the exact viral type, we sequenced the whole genome of one of the viruses isolated here. The whole genome analysis showed that the virus isolated in this outbreak shared almost 100% homology (only four nucleotides were different) to QS-DLL, and it was also grouped together with QS-DLL in the phylogenetic tree; this suggests HAdV-B55 to be the reason for the outbreak.",

They strongly suggested that the Chinese virus strain QS-DLL should be serotyped as HAdV-B11-14. They also proposed that the molecular typing and designation of recombinant viruses be based on the sequences of the hexon and fiber genes, as they confirmed that these genes accommodated the major epitopes involved in virus neutralization (VN). One month later, Seto wrote a letter to the editor of the same journal to dispute the opinions of Kajor. Seto claimed that using serology-based typing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were no longer performed in HAdV research, both of these assays being interpretive, subjective, and error-prone.13 At the Tenth International Adenovirus Meeting (Umea, Sweden, 2012), it was agreed that \u2018genotype\u2019 was to refer to HAdV characterized and type-numbered with genome data, \u2018molecular type\u2019 was to refer to viruses with limited DNA sequence data, and \u2018serotype\u2019 was to be reserved for strains characterized completely with serological methods.
