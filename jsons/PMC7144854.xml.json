An ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 started from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China since December of 2019. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 89.1% identical to bat SARS-like-CoVZXC45 and 96% identical to bat CoV RaTG13, suggesting that bat is the origin of SARS-CoV-2 [[2], [3], [4]]. A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the SARS-CoV-2 and a retrospective study indicated person-to-person transmission [5]. Moreover, people seem to be generally susceptible to this strongly infectious disease. WHO has listed the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Cases have already been diagnosed in dozens of countries.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was identified as the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human, similar to SARS-CoV [6]. ACE2 belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme family and catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin II into the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7. ACE2 is enriched in the epithelia of lung [7], while single-cell RNA-seq data analysis of ACE2 expression reveals potential risks of more human organs vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection [8]. In reproductive system, single-cell transcriptomes of adult human testis showed high expression of ACE2 in spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells [9]. Coronaviruses are prone to mutation and recombination due to their error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) [10], and virus variation may allow some subtypes of the virus to better bind to the receptor ACE2. Therefore, it is very important to reveal how ACE2 expression is regulated for both prevention and treatment of the infectious diseases caused by these coronaviruses in the future.",

            "text": "The major epigenetic markers in mammals include covalent modifications of DNA and post-translational modifications of histones. Since the N-terminal of histone is exposed to the surface of nucleosome, histone can undergo dynamic chemical modifications including methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination [11]. Methylation of H3 lysine residues such as K4, K9, K27 and K36 are intensively studied because of their high correlationship with transcriptional activity. K-to-M mutants of histone H3.3 play a dominant-negative role to suppress specific histone H3 methylation and are valuable tools for screening regulatory pattern of gene expression. During mammalian embryonic development, H3K27me3 is associated with transcriptional silencing and is involved in repressing key developmental genes during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. H3K27me3 is catalyzed by the polycomb group (PcG), a group of conserved transcriptional gene repressors. EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homologue 2) is a human homologue of enhancer of zeste in drosophila and the key member of PcG [12,13], which is composed of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes [14]. EZH2 encodes the catalytic subunit of PRC2 and functions as a histone methyltransferase of H3K27 dimethylation and trimethylation [15] for silencing at specific genomic loci [16]. In ESCs, EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 is necessary for cell identity and cell differentiation [17].",

The overexpression of H3.3 K-to-M mutants inhibited endogenous H3K4/9/27/36me3 respectively through sequestering catalytic SET domains of corresponding histone methyltransferases. Notably, we identified that Ace2 was significantly upregulated when H3K27 M was overexpressed to inhibit H3K27me3 level in GC-2 cells. In contrast, the levels of Ace2 expression were similar to the control group when H3.3 K4/9/36 M was overexpressed (Fig. 2\na).

This trend was consistent with that of mouse GC-2 cells. EZH2 regulates developmental factors in human ESCs for cell fate decision. However, the levels of cleavage embryonic genes (Fig. 2g) and pluripotent factors (Fig. 2h) were not influenced after EZH2 knockout [24], supporting that change of ACE2 expression was not caused by cell fate change. Taken together, our analysis indicated that presence of EZH2 impeded ACE2 expression.",

In order to determine whether EZH2 inhibits ACE2 expression by mediating histone modifications, we analyzed ChIP-seq data of wildtype, EZH2-deficient and EZH2 add-back human ESCs. ChIP-seq analysis showed that H3K27me3 level was decreased at ACE2 promoter region after EZH2 was knocked out [24] (Fig. 3\na). Meanwhile, there was a significant increase of acetylation of H3K27 (H3K27ac) levels at ACE2 promoter in EZH2-deficient ESCs [24] (Fig. 3b), supporting an antagonism between H3K27 acetylation and trimethylation. In agreement with above result, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac at ACE2 promoter were re-established upon EZH2 restoration [24] (Fig. 3a and b). H3K4me1 (Fig. 3c) and H3K4me3 (Fig. 3d) levels at ACE2 promoter area were also examined and no obvious change was observed upon EZH2 disruption [24], which indicated no crosstalk between H3K27 and H3K4 trimethylation at ACE2 promoter.

The digestive system and other human organs including heart is a potential route of 2019-nCov infection based on single-cell RNA-seq data analysis on the receptor ACE2 expression [8,26]. ACE2 Expression in cholangiocytes, kidney and testis may cause liver, kidney and testis damage after SARS-CoV-2 Infection [27,28]. ACE2 encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, a key molecule of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS). ACE2 is mainly composed of two domains. Its N-terminus is a zinc metallopeptidase domain similar to that of ACE. Its C-terminal domain is more conserved with collectrin, a non-catalytic protein involved in amino acid reabsorption in kidney and pancreatic \u03b2-cell proliferation. ACE2 is an important candidate gene for pathogenicity in a hypertensive rat model [29]. Therefore, ACE2 may be a potential target for the treatment of hypertension. ACE2 also plays an important role in maintaining normal heart function, and cardiac dysfunction was identified in Ace2-depleted mice [30].",

Meanwhile, there is no difference observed in the expression level of ACE2 between male and female. In addition, the expression level of ACE2 did not differ significantly in ACE2 highly expressed tissues between different races, which suggested regulatory mode of ACE2 expression applies to different races including Asian, African and European [32].
