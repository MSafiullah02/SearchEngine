Nevertheless, it is the accepted standard and only positive in patients who are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. CT findings in patients with COVID-19, on the other hand, are seen with numerous pathogens and in many non-infectious aetiologies. We believe CT does not add diagnostic value; positive results can only be believed if the pre-test probability of disease is high. Using CT diagnostically is not known to provide clinical benefit and could lead to false security if results are negative. If COVID-19 is suspected, patients should be isolated pending confirmation with (multiple) RT-PCR tests, or until quarantine has lapsed. The results of a CT scan do not change this.",

We urge caution and encourage using published guidelines3 regarding use of CT imaging.",
