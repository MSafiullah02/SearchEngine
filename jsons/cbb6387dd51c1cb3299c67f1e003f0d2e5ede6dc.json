Technologic advances in pathogen reduction and innovations in blood product processing will allow us to increase the safety profile and efficacy of blood products, ultimately to the benefit of patients.

Hemorrhagic shock is the most common cause of potentially preventable death after traumatic injury in both the civilian setting and combat environment 3 . Furthermore, resuscitation of the critically ill patient with fluid and blood products is one of the most ubiquitous interventions in medicine. Blood product availability is dependent on blood donation and availability of appropriate storage conditions and thus is a potentially limited resource. Since traditional blood products are obtained from human donation, they also have the potential issues of immunologic reactions and vectors of blood borne illness. The study of the ideal resuscitative product for patients in shock has become an area of great scientific interest and investigation. The purpose of this article is to review contemporary resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock, with a focus on blood products and blood product components. Additionally, existing concerns with regard to the risks of blood product transfusion, and how those risks may be mitigated with scientific advancements, specifically pathogen reduction technologies, will be highlighted.",

As a result of these potentially harmful effects, the use of \"balanced\" salt solution crystalloids such as Ringer's lactate and PlasmaLyte that are thought to be more physiologic are now being increasingly utilized. Balanced salt solution crystalloids are in fact crystalloid solutions that contain a buffer (such as lactate) to maintain the acid-base status as well as additional electrolytes (magnesium, potassium, calcium). The use of buffered solutions is associated with less metabolic derangement, hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis and as a result, their use has been favored in the clinical setting. Although these balanced salt solutions are thought to be superior to normal saline, they are not without issues. Despite having fewer effects on pH, balanced salt solutions have been shown to lead to coagulopathy, tissue edema (particularly problematic in the setting of traumatic brain injury and acute lung injury), and other detrimental physiologic effects [7] [8] [9] .",

Albumin has been shown to be an ideal fluid for resuscitation of patients with liver cirrhosis and other conditions related to liver failure, and is generally considered safe for resuscitation of critically ill patients, except those with traumatic brain injury 10 . The use of hydroxyethyl starch solutions has been associated with increased rates of renal-replacement therapy, bleeding, and mortality, and has largely fallen out of favor as a result 11 . Until recently, Hextend\u00ae (6% hetastarch in lactated salt solution) was the preferred resuscitative fluid in the absence of blood products by the United States military due to its smaller volume and potential for prolonged evacuations 12 . However, the newest Damage Control Resuscitation Clinical Practice Guideline has removed Hextend\u00ae from the guideline 13 .

Whole blood transfusions historically were the principal resuscitative fluid for hemorrhagic shock, beginning as early as World War I. During the Korean and Vietnam wars low titer Group O whole blood (LTOWB) was used extensively (along with some cases of non-Group O blood as requirements for blood increased) 16 . However, after the Vietnam era, blood was replaced by crystalloids and colloids as the primary resuscitative fluid for hemorrhagic shock, in both the military and civilian setting 17 . This was partially due to the risks associated with blood transfusion, such as transmission of infectious disease, but also related to research indicating that the interstitial compartment or \"third space\" required resuscitation with crystalloid for adequate tissue perfusion 17, 18 . By the early 1970s, whole blood had virtually disappeared from use. Instead, patients who received blood transfusions received unbalanced component therapy, in which red blood cell (RBC) to plasma ratios often reached 10:1, with platelets given even less frequently.",

In military settings, in which formal testing for transfusion transmitted diseases is often not possible, whole blood is collected from pretested donors (tested every 90 days during deployment) and stored at 22\u00b0C for up to 8 hours and then at 4\u00b0C for a maximum of another 24 hours; this is termed warm fresh whole blood 16 . In the civilian setting, whole blood can be stored without agitation at 2-6\u00b0C for up to 35 days if collected in the proper citrate solution. A number of studies have shown that transfusion of whole blood is safe, feasible, and may increase survival for some patients in hemorrhagic shock 16, 19, [21] [22] [23] . Whole blood also offers a logistical advantage in that it allows for simplification and streamlining of the massive transfusion process and may even decrease administrative errors that occur during the chaos of massive component transfusion. However, transfusion of whole blood is not without risks. Only about 8% of the US blood donor population is group O-, making these \"universal donor\" whole blood units scarce 24 . A number of studies have shown that it is feasible and safe to transfuse O+ whole blood, however, the risk of alloimmunization remains a concern 23,25,26 . However, only a small number of women of childbearing age are transfused.",

Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved storage of red blood cells for up to 42 days at 2-6\u00b0C 28 .

However, only 4% of the population is AB, resulting in a chronic shortage of universal donor plasma 34 . Transfusion of plasma has also been associated with transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). TRALI is the most common cause of transfusion related death. TRALI has been associated with antibodies found in the plasma of multiparous females and thus, many countries have eliminated or restricted the use of plasma from female donors, resulting in decreased incidence of TRALI 40 .

Another observational study was completed on 90 patients to determine the efficacy of INTERCEPT\u00ae to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections by the Chikungunya and Dengue viruses 97 . Of the individuals treated, only 3% had an adverse reaction to the INTERCEPT\u00ae platelet components, while 30% had a reaction unrelated to the platelet components.
