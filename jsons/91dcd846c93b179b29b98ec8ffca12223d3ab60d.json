Patients commonly present with dyspnea, hemoptysis, anemia, diffuse radiographic pulmonary infi ltrates and hypoxemia. The severity can range from mild dyspnea to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Diagnosis is frequently made at the time of bronchoscopy, when serial aliquots of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fl uid reveal a progressively hemorrhagic return. However, the presence of DAH carries a broad differential diagnosis (Table 10 .1 ) and is associated with a number of histopathologic patterns. This chapter will review the approach to the diagnosis and the management of DAH.",

Areas to consider include: (1) Does the patient have any elements to suggest a systemic autoimmune or collagen vascular disorder? The identifi cation of extra-pulmonary signs and symptoms may be helpful in revealing a potential underlying etiology for the DAH. For example, the identifi cation of skin lesions consistent with a cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, the presence of destructive upper airway lesions, or the fi nding of infl ammatory ocular disease may point the clinician towards the diagnosis of a primary small vessel vasculitis. Similarly, does the patient have a malar rash or synovitis to suggest possible systemic lupus erythematosus? (2) Does the patient have any underlying cardiac disease? Specifi cally, does the patient have valvular heart disease (i.e. mitral stenosis or rheumatic heart disease) or disease that might result in elevated left-sided Or engage in illicit drug use, such as crack cocaine? (4) Does the patient have a coagulation disorder or take any anticoagulants that might contribute to hemorrhage? Physical examination fi ndings in DAH are nonspecifi c. Objective fi ndings may include fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, diffuse crackles/rales, bronchial breath sounds or other fi ndings consistent with alveolar consolidation on chest auscultation. The search for extra-pulmonary fi ndings though may be extremely fruitful as regards identifying an inciting underlying systemic disease. Such fi ndings may include palpable purpura, conjunctivitis, septal perforation, iridocyclitis, synovitis, or focal neurologic defi cits/mononeuritis multiplex.",

Of note, these conditions are generally associated with bland pulmonary hemorrhage rather than a capillaritis lesion.

In cases of DAH complicating SLE, the diagnosis of SLE is usually established [ 3 ] . However, in cases where DAH is the presenting manifestation, serum testing for low serum complement (specifi cally C3 and C4), serum antinuclear antibodies, and the presence of anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies will help point to the diagnosis.

Pulmonary capillaritis is characterized by neutrophils infi ltrating the alveolar septa along the pulmonary capillaries with associated nuclear debris and hemorrhage. Capillaritis may, in some cases, also involve other small vessels such as the venules and arterioles. There is associated disruption of the alveolar-capillary basement membrane, and red blood cells, edema fl uid, fragmented neutrophils, debris and fi brin leak into the alveolar spaces [ 15 ] . The alveolar interstitium itself is broadened by the presence of edema, fi brinoid necrosis, infl ammatory cells, and red blood cells. The neutrophils in the interstitium and vessel walls degranulate and undergo apoptosis, and as such, often appear pyknotic and undergo karyorrhexis leaving behind characteristic basophilic nuclear debris. Other features that may occur or be identifi ed on this background pattern of lung injury include: small-vessel thrombosis, organizing pneumonia, and type II alveolar epithelial cell hyperplasia. Lastly, it should be noted that pulmonary capillaritis is a subset of pulmonary vasculitis in which the microcirculation of the lung (alveolar capillaries, arterioles, and venules) is predominantly affected and the larger pulmonary vessels are spared [ 16 ] .",

In 2007, Jayne and colleagues published the MEPEX trial (Randomized Trial of Plasma Exchange or High-Dosage Methylprednisolone as Adjunctive Therapy for Severe Renal Vasculitis) in which patients with severe renal disease were treated with corticosteroids and oral cyclophosphamide and additionally randomized to plasma exchange or high dose intravenous methylprednisolone [ 23 ] . Dialysis-independent survival was greater in the plasma exchange group than the intravenous corticosteroid group such that the addition of plasma exchange to corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide has since been recommended for the management of patients with severe renal disease. Whether this same strategy may be applied to patients with DAH was tested in a 20 patient case series, and indeed, this strategy appears to be effective in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage as well [ 24 ] .",

Nevertheless, it must be recognized that more often than not, it is the capillaritis driving the DAH and controlling the vasculitis is key to achieving therapeutic success. At the same time, diagnosing, treating and/or preventing the thromboembolic manifestations of the disease, as well as controlling the DAH, cannot be ignored. Thus, even in centers experienced in the management of complex autoimmune diseases, the management of these patients is extremely challenging and referral to a center of expertise is recommended when feasible. Nevertheless, fi rst line therapy for DAH associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is intravenous corticosteroids combined with optimal supportive care. Rapid resolution of most cases of DAH is typically seen after treatment with corticosteroids. In cases of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, IVIG or plasma exchange may be added to the intravenous corticosteroids and supportive care. Most recently, case reports describing the use of rituximab for refractory APLAS, including APLAS complicated by refractory DAH, have suggested that this agent may ultimately proven to have a role when more conventional therapies are unsuccessful [ 1 , 34 -36 ] .",

The majority of patients, approximately 60-80 %, present with a pulmonary-renal syndrome of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis.

Again, patients will complain of dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, hypoxemia, and/or constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever, anorexia, weight loss, arthralgias and myalgias). ABMA disease preferentially affects men more than women (approximately 2:1) and has a predilection for young adults (the average patient age reported ranges between 20 and 30). In those patients with ABMA who develop DAH, a history of smoking is extremely common (50-90 %), although recent viral infection or other inhalation exposures (e.g. hydrocarbons, marijuana, fi re smoke, cocaine) may also be seen immediately antecedent to the onset of DAH. In point of fact, it is hypothesized that cigarette smoking (or alternatively infection or other inhalational exposure) plays a pathophysiologic role in the development of DAH either through a secondary injury to the alveolar-capillary unit, facilitating antigen presentation, or allowing ABMAs entry into the lung [ 13 ] . On laboratory testing, anemia will commonly be present, and frequently will be accompanied by an elevated blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine consistent with renal insuffi ciency. Urinalysis frequently reveals microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts diagnostic of glomerulonephritis. Interestingly, 3-7 % of patients will be p-ANCA positive, suggesting the possibility of an overlap syndrome with MPA.

Of note, while antibody titers appear to correlate with the severity of the renal disease, no such correlation has been identifi ed with the pulmonary manifestations of the disease. Alternatively, patients may be diagnosed via lung or kidney biopsy and immunofl uorescence studies. On light microscopy, the histopathology of the lung in ABMA disease may demonstrate either bland hemorrhage or capillaritis (although the appearance of the capillaritis in ABMA disease tends to lack some of the more aggressive and destructive features seen in MPA or GPA). Similarly, the renal biopsy will demonstrate a focal, segmental, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescent formation that is indistinguishable from other etiologies of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. However, the frozen sections should demonstrate a positive immunofl uorescence pattern with a linear, continuous, \"ribbon-like\" appearance, refl ecting antibody that has bound to the basement membrane. This immunofl uorescence pattern is distinct from the punctate, patchy staining pattern seen in SLE and the negative or \"pauci-immune\" pattern associated with the AAV, and hence, is diagnostic for ABMA disease [ 38 ] .",

Plasmapharesis combined with corticosteroids and a cytotoxic agent (i.e. cyclophosphamide) has been shown to be effective in both of these clinical contexts and is associated with improved mortality and renal recovery [ 39 ] . Early diagnosis and prompt institution of therapy is crucial to optimizing outcomes, and as such, it is sometimes necessary to initiate therapy pending a conclusive diagnosis. Ultimately, the similarities in therapeutic recommendations for pulmonary renal syndrome, whether it is due to ANCA associated vasculitis, SLE or Goodpasture's syndrome combined with the adverse effects associated with delays in therapy makes this approach judicious. Steroids alone, or steroids combined with cytotoxic agents without the use of plasmaphresis do not achieve equivalent results. While there is no defi nitive data informing the optimal duration of plasmaphresis, the duration of therapy for Goodpasture's tends to be longer than in AAV, on the order of 10-14 exchanges, or until ABMAs become undetectable. With regard to choice of cytotoxic agent, cyclophosphamide is the most common agent utilized for life threatening alveolar hemorrhage. In more mild cases or as the patient's conditions improves, azathioprine (and more recently mycophenolate mofetil) have been used [ 20 ] . Lastly, rituximab has been proposed by some experts as a potential therapeutic agent for Goodpasture's syndrome based upon its mechanism of action and the pathogenetic role of ABMAs in the disease; however, beyond a handful of anecdotal reports, there is currently no evidence to support its use and its role in managing ABMA disease awaits further study.",

A retrospective review of patients with ABMA disease by Levy and colleagues, patients with a creatinine concentration of <5.7 mg/dl had a 1 year survival of 100 % and a renal survival of 95 %, those with a creatinine \u22655.7 mg/dl but who did not require immediate hemodialysis had a 1 year survival of 83 % and renal survival of 82 %, and those who required immediate hemodialysis had a 1 year survival of 65 % and renal survival of only 8 % [ 40 ] . A similar pattern is seen if one assesses renal involvement via biopsy in that patients with \u226570 % crescentic glomeruli and renal insuffi ciency may be expected to have persistent renal failure whereas patients with less than 30 % of their glomeruli having undergone crescent formation have improved survival and renal function. In a 28 patient case series of patients with ABMA disease and DAH reported by Lazor and colleagues, patients with pulmonary predominant disease (a paucity or absence of renal involvement) had a lower requirement for immunosuppressive therapy and plasma exchange than patients with a combined pulmonary renal syndrome. Interestingly, this cohort was characterized by frequent worsening of their pulmonary or renal disease but 100 % survival [ 13 ] . Unlike ANCA associated vasculitis, ABMA disease has generally been characterized more as a monophasic process without multiple recurrences, and those cases characterized by recurrence have tended to relapse in close proximity to disease onset [ 37 ] .",

Patients who present with IPH typically are children (80 %) and young adults (20 %). Males are preferentially affected relative to females (2:1). Familial cases have been reported. Clinically, the disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of DAH. As such patients present with cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, constitutional symptoms (fever, fatigue, malaise, anorexia), anemia (especially iron defi ciency anemia), hypoxia, recurrent pulmonary infi ltrates and/or exercise intolerance. The severity of individual episodes of hemorrhage may vary from asymptomatic to fulminant respiratory failure requiring a b mechanical ventilation. Given the recurrent nature of the episodes of DAH, pulmonary fi brosis and restrictive lung disease will develop in up to a quarter of patients. Alternatively, patients with more chronic and refractory courses may also develop obstructive lung disease. Impaired gas exchanged with a reduced DLCO has similarly been reported in patients with chronic and relapsing disease. An isolated elevation of serum IgA may be seen in up to half of pediatric patients with IPH and may help raise the possibility of IPH in the differential diagnosis of a younger patient with DAH [ 14 , 53 ] . By defi nition, in IPH there should be no evidence of a systemic disorder (vasculitis, immune complex mediated disease, collagen vascular disease, etc.), no potentially inciting drugs or exposures, no signifi cant cardiac lesions, no coagulopathy and no appreciable pathophysiologic explanation for the disease [ 53 ] . As such, a detailed history (including occupational, exposure, drug and medication history) full serologic evaluation for autoantibodies and markers of autoimmune disease, urinalysis with sediment examination, urine toxicology screening (e.g. cocaine) ECG, and echocardiography should all be within normal limits. Even then, given that this is a diagnosis of exclusion, as cases of IPH are followed longitudinally, they may later be re-classifi ed as a disease of known etiology as additional disease manifestations develop or objective data support an alternative diagnosis. It is believed that a number of cases in the published literature would have been classifi ed differently had serum anti-basement membrane antibody testing, ANCA testing and PR3/MPO ELISA testing been widely available at the time of publication. One caveat to this would be an observation that IPH may be associated with celiac disease or jejunal villous atrophy in some patients, and at least at present, would still be considered IPH [ 54 ] . Similarly, subtle fi ndings of capillaritis may easily be missed and cases of idiopathic pulmonary capillaritis may be mis-classifi ed as IPH. This is especially true in the patient who has started corticosteroid therapy or other disease modifying therapy prior to surgical lung biopsy. Moreover, this may explain why some patients with IPH are observed to respond to immunosuppression with corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents. Nevertheless, to diagnose IPH, the biopsy must demonstrate bland hemorrhage and an absence of any features of vasculitis/capillaritis [ 53 ] . Indeed, to make a defi nitive diagnosis of IPH a lung biopsy is essentially required.",

In 2011, the American Thoracic Society published an offi cial research statement on the spectrum of noninfectious lung injury after HSCT or the idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) [ 67 ] . Approximately 3-15 % of patients who undergo allogenic HSCT will develop a non-infectious lung injury within 120 days of transplantation. A subset of these patients will have DAH. As with other patients with DAH, patients will present with dyspnea, hypoxemia, cough, constitutional symptoms and bilateral radiographic infi ltrates. Hemoptysis occurs less frequently than expected and may be found in perhaps 15 % of patients. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is common. The onset of DAH usually occurs within 1-5 weeks of the HSCT. Risk factors associated with the development of DAH in these patients include advanced age, total body radiation, type of myeloablative conditioning regimens, and presence of severe acute graft-vs-host disease. While most cases of clinical DAH will be a subset of IPS, infection as a contributing feature to the development of DAH must be excluded, as hemorrhage in this subset of patients may also be due to infection. Mortality for DAH in this setting is 60-100 %. Furthermore, even for the minority of patients that survive an episode of DAH, the follow-up 6-month mortality is on the order of 40 %. Treatment for DAH associated with HSCT is high-dose corticosteroids a b and supportive care, but given the exceedingly high mortality, the effi cacy of this strategy is clearly limited. Attempts at protective strategies, including reductions in the intensity of the conditioning regimen, have not been proven to decrease the risk of disease [ 68 -71 ] .",

While cocaine may have legitimate medicinal properties as a local anesthetic, its stimulant properties make it an attractive drug of abuse. Cocaine may be inhaled nasally, smoked and inhaled in its free base form (\"crack\" cocaine) or injected intravenously. Inhaled crack cocaine is commonly associated with an array of pulmonary complications including thermal injuries to the upper airways, cough and carbonaceous sputum, barotrauma (pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum), cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, bronchospasm and asthma, eosinophilic lung reactions, organizing pneumonia, \"crack lung,\" hemoptysis and pulmonary hemorrhage. Acute respiratory symptoms usually develop with several hours of use but may develop in a matter of minutes or may evolve over several days. Presenting complaints will include cough, chest pain (usually pleuritic), shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and wheezing. Hypoxic, tachycardia, tachypnea, and abnormalities on auscultation are common. Imaging fi ndings depend upon the manifestation of cocaine pulmonary toxicity, but in the case of \"crack lung\" or alveolar hemorrhage, bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates are identifi ed. Toxicology screening should reveal the presence of cocaine metabolites in the urine [ 2 ] .

Histology in \"crack lung\" is characterized by DAD, edema, infl ammatory infi ltrates, and hemorrhage.

Further investigation into ventilatory strategies using differing levels of positive end expiratory pressure were unable to achieve clinically signifi cant differences, but re-inforced the desirability of keeping the end inspiratory plateau pressure below 30 mmHg [ 83 ] .

Additionally, investigation into the optimal management of analgesia and sedation, liberation strategies from mechanical ventilation, nutritional management, the prevention of hospital acquired conditions (catheter related blood stream infections, ventilator associated pneumonia, pressure ulcers, venous thromboembolic disease, etc.) and restrictive transfusion strategies have all contributed to the improvements seen in the management of the critically-ill patient including those with ARDS.
