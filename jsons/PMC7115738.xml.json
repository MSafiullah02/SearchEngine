Staphylococcus aureus and mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa continue to be the key pulmonary pathogens.\u2022Survival has improved in patients with CF in part because of aggressive antimicrobial management. An unintended consequence of this therapy has been the emergence of 2 multidrug-resistant environmental bacteria: the Burkholderia cepacia group and nontuberculous mycobacteria.\u2022\nBurkholderia cenocepacia, a species within the Burkholderia cepacia complex, is associated with high mortality and is a contraindication for lung transplantation. The key nontuberculous mycobacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium abscessus, is not so virulent and is not a lung transplantation contraindication. Both present an infection control challenge, because they can be spread from person to person.\u2022Improving genomic and proteomic technologies are allowing better identification of bacteria and fungi found in the CF lung and to detect viral agents that may be associated with pulmonary exacerbations. Chronic rhinovirus infections are of particular interest.\u2022Microbiome studies have identified 2 groups of bacteria that may play a role in chronic CF lung infections: anaerobic bacteria and Streptococcus angionsus group organisms. Microbiome studies also show that as the diversity of organisms decline, perhaps as a result of aggressive antimicrobial therapy, an apex predator, etc., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, may emerge in many patients with CF.\n\n",

As a result, patients with CF have thick, dry, tenacious mucus, which impairs mucociliary clearance of particulates, especially bacteria and fungal conidia, from the airways. This environment is ideal for the growth of a limited number of organisms, primarily those that thrive in natural environments such as water. This thickened mucus provides an ideal niche for the establishment of chronic infection. It is this chronic infection that results in the premature death that in seen in CF.3\n",

The airways of patients with CF become infected in infancy. This situation begins periods of chronic infection and lung inflammation with accompanying cough, which is a lifelong reality in patients with CF. A hallmark of chronic infection and airway inflammation is periods of pulmonary exacerbations. Pulmonary exacerbations are characterized by worsening symptoms, including increased cough and sputum production, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, increased respiratory rate, loss of appetite, weight loss, increased neutrophil counts, and declining pulmonary function.5 The events that trigger these pulmonary exacerbations are not clearly understood, although viral infections and perhaps changes in the microbiome may be important.6, 7 Exacerbations are characterized by the recruitment of neutrophils, cytokine release, and high level of neutrophil-derived elastases in the bronchi and bronchioles, causing significant lung disease.8 Antimicrobial therapy has been shown to be effective in treating exacerbations symptomatically.9 However, over time, lung function deteriorates and becomes so low, that it is no longer compatible with life (Fig. 1\n). Only lung transplantation can successfully reverse this disease course.8\n",

Such organisms are considered to be thymidine dependent. Such organisms are not as fit as wild-type organism and grow slowly, producing small, streptococcallike colonies on most enrichment media.16 Another SCV that is seen in S aureus are strains with defect in electron transport. These strains are resistant to aminoglycosides. These mutants cannot generate sufficient proton motor force to drive transport of these large, highly charged molecules into the bacterial cytoplasm.17 SCV are less susceptible to antimicrobials, especially \u03b2-lactams, because of their slow growth rate, making them more challenging to treat and resulting in a greater decline in pulmonary function.17, 19\n",

It is now recognized that approximately 20% to 25% of patients with CF have MRSA (Fig. 3\n).4, 20 It has also been recognized that patients with CF with MRSA have a higher mortality than those patients with CF without this organism.21 Most CF MRSA isolates can be divided into 2 molecular types based on staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC) mecA type and whether they have the gene for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl). Approximately 70% are SCCmecA type II pvl negative and 17% are SCCmecA type IV pvl positive; the other 13% are SCCmecA type IV pvl negative.20 SCCmecA type IV, pvl positive MRSA isolates are also referred to as community-acquired (CA)-MRSA strains. Initial studies of respiratory infections in healthy adults caused by CA-MRSA suggested that this organism caused severe, necrotizing pneumonia, with significant morbidity and mortality in excess of 50% in some series.22 We were concerned that this organism would be a problem in patients with CF as well. In a survey performed between 2005 and 2007, we found that approximately 3% of patients with CF in our institution had CA-MRSA recovered from their respiratory specimen and that approximately 1% of patients in our center were chronically infected. Further, no episodes of necrotizing pneumonia were seen in our population of patients with CF during that period.23\n",

This patient had been chronically infected with MRSA for more than 10 years and had received repeated courses of vancomycin. Over time, her pulmonary function declined. With the emergence of VISA, she was treated with multiple courses of linezolid and ceftaroline. Neither was successful in eradicating the organism. Because of declining lung function, she received a double lung transplant. On her most recent bronchoscopy culture 9 months after transplant, she had positive S aureus infection culture; the organism was both vancomycin and oxacillin susceptible, but the VISA strain has not been recovered from multiple bronchoscopy specimens obtained during the posttransplant period (Miller M and Gilligan P, 2013, unpublished data).",

The organism is typically obtained from the patient\u2019s environment, although patient-to-patient spread of virulent clones does occur.30 The pathogenesis of P aeruginosa is dependent on the transition of the organism from a motile, virulent, nonmucoid organism to a nonmotile, comparatively avirulent, mucoid organism, which has adapted to living in the CF airways. The transition is believed to be caused by mutations that inactivate the mucA gene, which regulates alginate production. Alginate-producing organisms grow in a biofilm within the mucous layer in bronchioles of the CF lung. These organisms may be observed as microcolonies when the mucous layer is observed microscopically.31 On agar plates, these organisms appear as mucoid colonies (Fig. 5\n). In the lung, these organisms are resistant to mechanical clearance, phagocytosis, and antimicrobial therapy.3, 31 Although they are comparatively avirulent, they induce a chronic inflammatory response, which is believed to be responsible for the lung damage that results in the patient\u2019s demise.31 This disease process takes place over a period of years to decades.",

Antimicrobial susceptibility results using automated susceptibility systems correlate poorly with reference methods and are not recommended. Rather, disk diffusion or E-tests are recommended.33 Paradoxically, it is unlikely that conventional susceptibility testing accurately predicts in vivo response.34 The reasons for this situation are complex but can be explained in part by comparing susceptibility of P aeruginosa with antimicrobials when the organism is grown in a conventional manner or planktonically versus a biofilm mode of growth. When P aeruginosa is grown as a biofilm, it is 8 to 32 times more resistant to all classes of \u03b2-lactams than when it is grown planktonically.35 This difference can be explained in part by reduced growth rates of mucoid colonies and by the possibility that these antimicrobials cannot penetrate to the cell through the alginate layer. There is little difference between the MICs for aminoglcyosides or fluoroquinolones grown under these 2 conditions.35 Further complicating interpretation of these results is a growing body of literature that suggests that P aeruginosa may grow under anaerobic conditions behind mucous plugs or in the thickened mucus of the airway.36 Tobramycin is not active under anaerobic conditions, because of poor transport into bacteria. Aerosolized tobramycin therapy, a key strategy in early eradication of P aeruginosa,9, 31 may act only against organisms in the airway that are growing in the superficial layer of mucus. Chronic P aeruginosa infection may be established only when the organism is growing as a biofilm in the anoxic portion of the mucous layer. Further complexity in susceptibility testing is caused by the widespread use of aerosolized antimicrobials, tobramycin, colistin, and aztreonam, used to prevent the establishment of chronic P aeruginosa or to suppress the growth of P aeruginosa in those patients chronically infected.37 Because antimicrobial susceptibility is based on achievable serum drug concentrations, susceptibility testing does not accurately predict resistance in patients receiving aerosolized antimicrobials, which reach airway levels at least 10 to 25 times greater than serum levels.",

Technically, susceptibility testing of mucoid P aeruginosa is poorly reproducible and operator dependent.38 In the late stages of chronic P aeruginosa infection, after many rounds of intravenous and aerosolized antimicrobial therapy, the organism may become resistant to all classes of antimicrobial.34 One of the strategies was to perform multicombinational bactericidal testing (MCBT).39 In this method, 2-drug, 3-drug, and 4-drug combinations at serum achievable concentrations are placed in a microtiter well, inoculated with a bacteria, incubated overnight, and then subcultured to determine which combinations were bactericidal. The idea behind this method was to give a rationale for choosing antimicrobial combinations that would be used to treat these infections. However, when a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was performed to compare MCBT with conventional susceptibility, outcomes were similar for the 2 groups.40 Although the study was technically well performed, it was flawed because the patients studied were infected with organisms that had some level of susceptibility to antimicrobials and would not have needed MCBT. Based on this study, MCBT has been abandoned by the CF community.",

In this syndrome, the patients had respiratory infections, with hallmarks of rapid decline in pulmonary function and frequent bacteremia, a highly unusual finding in patients with CF.41, 42 Subsequently, P cepacia was reclassified as belonging to the genus Burkholderia.44 Vandamme and colleagues45 showed that the organisms identified as Burkholderia cepacia represented multiple species of bacteria, which they called genomovars. The B cepacia complex is now recognized to consistent of 18 different species.46, 47 The species within this complex that is believed to be primarily responsible for the cepacia syndrome is B cenocepacia, although both B multivorans and B dolosa have also been associated with it.46\nB cenocepacia or B multivorans are recovered from 80% of the B cepacia complex infections seen in patients with CF.46 The molecular epidemiology of B cenocepacia is reasonably well understood. Three different B cenocepacia clones, designated ET12,42 PHDC,43 and Midwest,44 were associated with the initial description of B cepacia as a pathogen in patients with CF.46 All 3 of these clones can be spread from person to person, although many patients have unique clones, which they likely acquired from their environment.48 It has been shown that the ET-12 strain has been spread from Toronto to Europe and that it is the predominant strain in Canada.46, 49 The organism has an unusual appendage called a cable pilin, which is believed to be responsible for its high transmissibility.50\n",

Some of the transplants were further complicated by wound dehiscence. Posttransplant patients with B cenocepacia sepsis had a grim prognosis, with few survivors. Bronchiolitis obliterans was an additional problem seen in this patient population.52 Other studies also showed increased risk of death after transplant in patients with CF infected before transplant with B cenocepacia.53, 54 As result, most centers no longer transplant patients with CF who are infected with B cenocepacia.\n",

B cepacia selective agar (BCSA)55 was superior for B cepacia recovery compared with P cepacia agar56 and oxidation-fermentation polymyxin-bacitracin-lactose agar.57 All 3 media contain polymixin as a selective agent. Not only were B cepacia complex organisms isolated on these media from CF respiratory specimens but also a large group of environmental glucose nonfermenters, which were similar to B cepacia, were also recovered. These organisms were often phenotypically difficult to separate from B cepacia using commercially available kits, resulting in misidentification of non-B cepacia isolates as B cepacia complex ones.58, 59 Alternatively, some isolates were relatively inert biochemically, making them difficult to identify using commercially available phenotypic methods.58, 59\n",

In addition to no longer being candidates for lung transplantation in most centers, the patients are completely segregated from other children and adults with CF. They are likely to have a different clinic day, must always be on isolation when hospitalized, meaning no trips to the playroom to interact with other children, may no longer attend any CF sponsored social function or meetings, or participate in camps with other patients with CF.60 The result is social isolation for these individuals and potential exclusion from a life-saving therapy. These draconian measures have been successful in blunting the spread of this organism among patients with CF.60 Perhaps just as importantly, misidentifying B cepacia complex organism as some other species or genera results in failure to isolate patients with a potentially deadly organism, which can be spread to both patients with CF and those who do not have CF.49, 61\n",

With the exception of the unusual P aeruginosa phenotypes identified by sequencing, the rest of the organisms identified were recovered on BCSA, the B cepacia selective medium that we use. Many more non-B cepacia complex organisms requiring identification grow on BCSA. Almost all the organisms listed in Table 1 are recovered primarily from patients with CF. Most of them, including Ralstonia, Chyseobacterium, Inquilinus, and Pandoraea, are infrequently recovered and are believed to be of limited clinical importance. One group is reported in our laboratory as gram-negative rods, not Burkholderia, Ralstonia, or Pandoraea. Included in this group are Bordetella spp, including Bordetella broncoseptica, Comamonas, Herbaspirillium, Elizabethkingia, and Cupriavidus.

It is now well recognized that acute exacerbations are associated with both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.104, 105, 106 One of the most interesting observations was the high rate of detection of rhinovirus, approximately 30% when a multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used.107, 108 Rhinovirus tends to persist in the CF airway, and viral loads increase during pulmonary exacerbations.108 Using a CF airway epithelial model, it has been shown that rhinovirus superinfection of P aeruginosa\u2013infected cells causes a release of planktonic bacteria. This release of planktonic bacteria during viral infection may be an important trigger of CF pulmonary exacerbations.6\n",

Given the unusual nature of the matrix in which the virus may be found, specific evaluation of NAAT performance in these specimens would be useful. A meta-analysis112 for influenza antigen detection assays suggested that these methods lack sensitivity in patients with low viral loads.

In patients with CF, we have learned that other organisms beyond those that we have already discussed may play an important role in CF lung disease. Organisms typically believed as belonging to the normal microflora of the oropharynx, Prevotella, Veillonella, and the Streptococcus anginosus group, are all found in respiratory tract of patients with CF.5, 13 It is speculated that these organisms might upregulate or downregulate virulence genes in pathogens such as P aeruginosa to obtain essential nutrients through the activity of these pathogens.12 Another observation that has arisen as a result of microbiome studies is that microbial communities are remarkably stable, even in the face of repeated rounds of antimicrobial therapy.11, 13 In addition, as chronic P aeruginosa infection is established, the diversity of the microbial community declines.10 Is this a result of P aeruginosa being the apex predator in the CF airway microbiome eliminating competitors and adapting itself by downregulating virulence genes to allow long-term survival of its human host? Over the next decade, we should get closer to this answer.",
