Here, an alternating current is passing through a resistant metal wire electrode, generating heat which is then applying to living tissue to achieve the hemostasis or varying degrees of tissue destruction.1 Heating of tissues causes vaporisation of protein and fat which results surgical smoke2 which contain particles from combustion and numerous chemicals like hydrocarbons, acrylonitrile, phenols and fatty acids and biological particles, viruses, and bacteria which are known to be potentially hazardous. Applications of high-frequency electrocautery in cutting and coagulation modes produce odorous smoke from tissue pyrolysis. Thus surgical smoke is a by-product of the heat produced by electrosurgical tools.",

It is reported that surgical smoke has mutagenic effects as well.6 Surgical smoke contains contaminants such as hydrocarbons, acrylonitrile, phenols, fatty acids, nitriles and carbon monoxide and viable cellular elements.7\n,\n8 The main chemical in surgical smoke is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs). Amongst these PAHs, benzopyrene(BaP) is the most significant carcinogenic compound.9 Benzopyrene is often used as an indicator of cancer risk for target populations. Studies have shown that higher cauterisation temperatures produce more harmful chemical components while lower temperatures produce more cell particles (5). It is also found that different electrosurgical techniques produce different amounts of surgical smoke.10 The chemical composition of surgical smoke also varies by the type of tissue dissected. Muscular tissue produces aldehyde and ketone; liver and fatty tissue liberates carbon monoxide and hydrocyanic acid; epidermal tissue produces xylene, toluene, and ethyl benzene.5\n",

There have also been reports of flash fires, especially in the case of increased oxygen concentrations of anesthetics.33. The toxicity of surgical smoke may cause harm to patients.There have been no reports that surgical smoke exposure to patients can cause any obvious chronic diseases such as cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COLD). Such diseases might be caused by accumulation processes. Diathermy can also cause tissue damage through energy transfer to the implanted spinal cord stimulation system, resulting in serious injury or death. Diathermy incision has many advantages compared with the scalpel because of reduced incision time, less blood loss, and reduced early postoperative pain.34, but there are reports which show increased tissue damage and a significant reduction in the tensile strength of healing wounds.35\n",
