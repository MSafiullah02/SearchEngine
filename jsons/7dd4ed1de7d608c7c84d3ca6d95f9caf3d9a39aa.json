Remarkably, the CJ 24 inoculated-macaques developed mild interstitial pneumonia and viral load was 25 detectable in the conjunctival swabs at 1 days post-inoculation (dpi). Only via IT 26 inoculation, viral load was detected in the anal swab at 1-7 dpi and macaque showed 27 weight loss. However, viral load was undetectable after IG inoculation. Comparatively, 28 viral load was higher in the nasolacrimal system but lesions of lung were relatively 29 mild and local via CJ inoculation compared with that via IT inoculation, . The potential extra-respiratory portals that SARS-CoV-2 enter the host need to be 45 further research by laboratory-confirmation for providing significant data to oversight 46 and prevention for healthcare workers. We daily observed the macaques for clinical signs. There was no significant change in 56 the body weight ( Figure 2A ) in the CJ and IG inoculated macaques and the 57 temperature ( Figure 2B ) in all the inoculated macaques, while the weight loss was 58 obvious in the IT inoculated macaques and dropped about 125 g at 5 dpi. Routine 59 specimens, including nasal and throat swabs, were collected on 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7-day 60 post-inoculation (dpi). Additionally, to explore the potentially excretory routes of 61 SARS-CoV-2 in the host, the conjunctival and anal swabs were also gathered. 62 Specifically, CJ and IT inoculated animals were able to detect a continued viral load 63 in their nasal and throat swabs from 1 to 7 dpi. In contrast, the virus was not detected 64 in any swabs from the IG inoculated macaques. Notably, only via the CJ route, viral 65 load can be tested in conjunctival swabs (average, approximately 4.33 log10 RNA 66 copies/mL) on 1 dpi and then became undetectable implying that the 67 inoculated-SARS-CoV-2 may be transferred from the initial entry-conjunctiva to 68 respiratory tract and other tissues. Meanwhile, only via the IT route, viral load can be 69 ongoing examined in the anal swabs on 1-7 dpi and reached the peak about 6.76 log10 70 RNA copies/mL on 5 dpi, revealing distinct excretory pathways of host after 71 inoculation via different routes ( Figure 2C ). To determine the distribution of virus and histological lesions, CJ-1, IT-1, and IG-1 74 were euthanized and necropsied on 7 dpi. For CJ-1, viral load was primarily 75 distributed in the nasolacrimal system and ocular, including the lacrimal gland (3.93 76 log10 RNA copies/mL), optic nerve (1.03 log10 RNA copies/mL), and conjunctiva 77 (1.01 log10 RNA copies/mL); in the nose, including the nasal mucosa (6.25 log10 RNA 78 copies/mL), nasal turbinate (6.63 log10 RNA copies/mL), and nostril (1.03 log10 RNA 79 copies/mL); in the pharynx including epiglottis (4.57 log10 RNA copies/mL), soft 80 palate (5.60 log10 RNA copies/mL); in the oral cavity including check pouch (1.03 81 log10 RNA copies/mL) and parotid gland (1.04 log10 RNA copies/mL); as well as in 82 other tissues including lower left lobe of lung (4.6 log10 RNA copies/mL), tonsil (4.51 83 log10 RNA copies/mL), inguinal (1.01 log10 RNA copies/mL) and pararectal (6.25 84 log10 RNA copies/mL) lymph node, stomach (4.61 log10 RNA copies/mL), duodenum 85 (4.66 log10 RNA copies/mL), ileum (1.08 log10 RNA copies/mL) and caecum (1.06 86 log10 RNA copies/mL) (Figure 1d ). By contrast, for IT-1, the distribution of virus 87 might be somewhat different owing to viral replication was highly in different lobes 88 of the lung (10 4.22 to 10 7.81 copies/mL), and viral load was also widely detected in the 89 nasal septum (4.69 log10 RNA copies/mL), tracheas (6.61 log10 RNA copies/mL), The darker the blue color, the higher the viral load. The specific IgG antibody against 305 SARS-CoV-2 in the sera of the inoculated-macaques were tested by ELISA on 0, 7, 306 14, and 21 dpi (E). According to unpaired Welch's t-test, the specific IgG antibody in 307 the sera of conjunctival inoculated macaque exhibited a significant increase compared 308 with prior to inoculation (**p=0.0027) and 21 dpi (**p=0.0039). CJ-1 and CJ-2 were 309 the two macaques that inoculated via conjunctival route, IT-1 was the macaque that 310 inoculated via intratracheal route. IG-1 and IG-2 were the two macaques that 311 inoculated via intragastric route. ND, not detected. NC, negative control (unpaired 312 Welch's t-test, **p<0.01 ). ",

Consistent with the radiographic alteration, microscopically, 111 local lesions in the lungs from the CJ-1 displayed mild interstitial pneumonia 112 characterized by widened alveolar interstitium, infiltration of inflammatory cells 113 primarily including lymphocytes and monocytes, a small amount of exudation in the 114 alveolar cavities (Figure 3B). Virus antigen was further confirmed by the 115 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody via immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain. In the 116 damaged lobe of lungs, SARS-CoV-2 was predominantly observed in the alveolar 117 epithelium and exfoliated-degenerative cellular debris in the alveolar cavities (Figure 118 3B) both in CJ-1 and IT-1. Notably, the results of IHC were highly in accordance with 119 the data of viral load detection on 7 dpi both in the CJ-1 and IT-1. Specifically, viral 120 antigens were scattered in several cells in the nasolacrimal system via conjunctival 121 inoculation, while they were more prominent in the trachea via intratracheal 122 inoculation (Figure 4). Moreover, viral antigen was obviously observed in the lamina 123 propria of alimentary tract suggesting that the virus may spread from the initial entry 124 to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Supplementary Figure 1), and they were relatively 125 slight detected in the kidney, myocardium, and liver in IT-1 but undetectable in CJ-1. Supplementary Figure 2). Briefly, animal inoculated via conjunctival route gave 127 evidence of relatively mild and local interstitial pneumonia compared to the 128 intratracheal inoculated-macaque which demonstrated moderate, diffuse lesions demonstrated that macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 via the 133 conjunctival route rather than the intragastric route. Compared to the intratracheal 134 route, viral load was comparatively high in the nasolacrimal system and lesions in the 135 lung were relatively mild and local via the conjunctival route. Similarly, rhesus monkeys via a single route via conjunctiva, intra-stomach, or 140 intra-trachea, to avoid multiple routes of co-inoculation for confirming the exact 141 pathway of inoculation. These results suggest that conjunctiva is a potential portal for 142 viral transmission. In our results, viral load was detectable in several nasolacrimal 143 system associated-tissues, especially in the conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, nasal cavity 144 and throat, which drew the outline of the anatomical bridge between ocular and 145 respiratory tissues. Particularly, the lacrimal duct functions as a conduit to collect and 146 transport tear fluid from the ocular surface to the nasal-inferior meatus, being 147 convenient for the drainage of virus from ocular to respiratory tract tissues. Actually, 148 the previous report had demonstrated that although virus-containing fluid can be taken 149 up through the conjunctiva, sclera, or cornea, the majority of liquid including tear and 150 secretions is drained into the nasopharyngeal space or swallowed; the lacrimal duct 151 epithelia are also possible to contribute to the absorption of tear fluid. Our results 152 were highly consistent with the anatomical features that viruses enter the host via the 153 conjunctival route. On the other hand, previous research demonstrated that 154 SARS-CoV was undetectable in cynomolgus monkeys after intragastric inoculation 155 which consistent with our result. At present, still, no evidence could prove that 156 SARS-CoV-2 can transmission via fecal-oral route 5 , although viral RNA of 157 SARS-CoV-2 was prolonged detectable in fecal samples from patients 6 and in have the capability to stimulate ocular complications in infected 161 patients, which then leads to respiratory infection 7 . The fact that exposed mucous 162 membranes and unprotected eyes increased the risk of SARS-CoV 1 or SARS-CoV-2 2 163 transmission suggests that healthcare professionals need to increase the awareness of 164 eye protection in close contact with the patients or in crowded places. biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) facility in the Institute of Laboratory Animal 169 Science was used to complete all the experiments with rhesus macaques. All research 170 was performed in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other regulations 171 relating to animals and experiments. The Institutional Animal Care and Use 172 Committee of the Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, Peking Union Medical 173 College, reviewed and authorized all the programs in this research applied to the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 stocks. Dulbecco's modified 180 Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) were applied to incubate this 181 cell line at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 182 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin, and maintained.
