The research design had some elements that aligned with participatory action research. It sought participatory engagement and collaborative partnerships with young people in the design and collection of data (Wilson & Flicker, 2014). The design was informed by an advisory group of young people with complex support needs who recommended that participants be provided with a range of options for participation including: group or one-on-one participation; telling their story in different ways (through body mapping, lifeline mapping, or an interview); having a support person present; and telling their whole life story or focussing on one personally significant transition. By using multiple methods, the researchers were able to explore the lived experiences of transition in both structured ways via in-depth interviews, and in a more flexible and intuitive manner via body mapping. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval HC16950), with expedited approval provided by The University of Queensland, Monash University, and La Trobe University.",

The first criterion required that young people participants were aged between 16 and 26 years (for body mapping) or 18 and 25 years (for individual interviews). The age range was adjusted for body mapping in consultation with service providers and partners who felt that the narrower age range would not facilitate access to certain groups of young people located in rural areas or who lived with an intellectual disability. These age ranges aligned with existing policy from multiple service sectors who support young people. The second criterion required that young people\u2019s experiences of transition were congruent with the study definition of complex support needs which included experience of two or more of the following: having resided in out-of-home care; living with intellectual or other cognitive disability; experiences of mental illness; homelessness or housing insecurity; specialist or alternative education; problematic drug and alcohol use; and/or police or youth justice contact.",

Individual interview participants comprised four males and three females. Four body mapping participants identified as coming from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (13%), and two participants identified as Aboriginal Australians (6%), with the remainder not acknowledging their background.

Body mapping facilitates non-verbal story-telling and encourages imagination and creativity, allowing participants to reflect on emotions and thoughts using visual, verbal and kinaesthetic modalities (Dew, Smith, & Collings, 2018; Gastaldo et al., 2018). It is particularly useful in research with individuals with complex support needs who may have difficulty participating fully in verbal-centric research (Dew et al., 2018). The adaptation of body mapping as a research method for this study is explained in depth in Smith and Dowse (2019).",

Sessions commenced with a discussion about \u2018big transitions\u2019, with the researcher sharing one or more of their own personal transitions. Participants were then invited to choose the transition they wished to body map, using a range of art and collage materials. During and after construction of the body maps, participants were invited to explain their choice of symbols and what they represented in the transition experience. These explanations enhanced credibility by allowing the researcher to check meanings and interpretations with the young person (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Where participant permission was obtained, body mapping sessions were audio-recorded. Researchers also took field notes about participants\u2019 stories, and descriptions of researcher/support person-participant interactions.",

These accounts were combined with researcher field notes and synthesised into a detailed narrative description of each body mapping session (a testimonia). This narrative approach was based on the ethnographic concept of constructing rich, thick description discussed by Geertz (1973) and included a depiction of the story presented by the body map; an account of the symbols, and their placement and intended meaning in the body map; and a key that explained the symbols. The construction of a holistic account of the body mapping experience for each participant enabled researchers to articulate the multi-faceted complexity of young people\u2019s experiences of transition with depth and meaning.",

Individual interviews generated verbatim transcripts, and body mapping resulted in both visual body maps and detailed narratives about the body maps and the field notes about the process used to construct them. Analytical approaches to body mapping are underdeveloped and emerging (Orchard, 2017), and data analysis in this study reflects that developmental status. In this study, visual images of body maps were initially analysed using content analysis. A table of symbols used in the body maps was developed to identify patterns across the data. Each symbol was grouped into types related to their location on the map (i.e. whether inside or outside of the body); whether the symbol was text or image; and the overarching meaning of the symbol (for example, the depiction of support persons, or the expression of particular emotions). Content analysis enabled researchers to confirm that key aspects and symbols included in the visual images were considered, and facilitated analysis of the types, uses, meanings and locations of symbols as presented in various sections of the body maps. Narrative body mapping data, the results of the content analysis, and young people\u2019s interview transcripts were all analysed using grounded theory methods (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) as discussed in Charmaz (2014). Initial line-by-line coding of narrative body mapping data, body map content analysis, and interview transcripts was undertaken. The line-by-line coding used the heuristic device of gerunds, allowing the researchers to gain a sense of action from young people\u2019s accounts, stay close to the data and begin understanding the content from young people\u2019s perspectives. This process was also complemented through the use of memo-writing, which assisted the researchers in determining their analytical direction (Charmaz, 2014). Coding was subsequently organised into higher order categories based upon shared characteristics and themes using the constant comparison approach described in Braun and Clarke (2006). Cross-coding of the interview transcripts by the first three authors of transcripts and body mapping narratives ensured consistency of themes and minimised individual researcher biases (Barbour, 2001). The combination of textual and visual data enabled a rich understanding of young people\u2019s lived experiences, including their accounts of paid relationships.",

This was an essential feature of workers who were permitted into young people\u2019s \u2018dark spaces\u2019, and invited to accompany them through transitions. Robert, who depicted himself as an invincible, magical super hero in his body map (capturing his transition through drug-induced psychosis), saw his social worker as someone he could communicate with deeply. According to Robert, the worker conveyed an ability to listen to him, had \u201c\u2026seen what was going through my mind\u201d, and accepted him without judgment:It would have hurt and destroyed my family to tell them this stuff. I didn\u2019t trust the mental health team yet as I was still unwinding my mind after the psychosis but I trusted my social worker because she didn\u2019t judge and I felt like she was learning from me about the drug scene; things she didn\u2019t know or understand. She was the one person I could talk to about what I was doing or how I felt.",

His body map, dotted with random \u2018foot\u2019 markings, highlighted his need to shape the nature of his support\u2014\u201cAll the foot marks [made by our dirty feet] mean that you weren\u2019t controlled, you weren\u2019t programmed, you weren\u2019t designed for one purpose.

In contrast, young people with complex support needs who were excluded or self-excluded from services were highly unlikely to be participants of the study, likely generating some sampling bias. Given that important learnings have emerged out of the insights and reflections young people provided about the nature of their supports, along with the potential relevance of these findings for future engagement with excluded members of this cohort, the researchers considered the potential bias to be an acceptable risk of the recruitment strategy.",

As stated in the methodology, young people were invited to bring a support person to optimise emotional and cultural safety during body mapping, and a number of young people chose their usual worker to support them during this process. Some of these young people shared their feelings about and experiences with these workers during body mapping and were frequently very positive about the support they were receiving from this person. While it is likely that young people chose workers they trusted and valued to participate in the body mapping, and that positive comments offered about workers were reflective of the effectual nature of the relationship, it is also possible that some young people felt compelled to talk more positively about that worker than they might have done in the worker\u2019s absence. There were however examples of young people without workers present during data collection but who also shared positive stories about current and former workers. Conversely, some young people who had workers present during body mapping shared both positive and negative stories about workers in their testimonia. The body mapping process allowed young people substantial choice and control over what issues were discussed, and offered an opportunity for young people to express their views on paid relationships in ways they may have never experienced before. Its utility as a research method in eliciting young people\u2019s views may also have relevance in the context of professional practice, as a creative way of engaging with hard-to-reach young people.",

Participants only used one method, either semi-structured interviews or body mapping. It is possible that if young people were given the opportunity to engage in both interviews and body mapping, there may have been a richer insight into their transition experiences and relationship-based practice. However, both approaches required a significant amount of time and commitment from young people about sensitive issues, and to do both would increase the risk of research participant burden for young people (Lingler, Schmidt, Gentry, Hu, & Terhorst, 2014). While engagement with individual participants was restricted to one data collection method, the use of both semi-structured interviews and body-mapping across the sample, extended the breadth and scope of participation of young people with complex support needs (Hammond, 2005).",
