Although the peak incidence is between 6 months and 4 years of age, neonatal infection is relatively frequent.

In resource-limited settings, these transmission patterns frequently overlap, and spread of gastrointestinal infections is amplified by factors such as overcrowding, poor hygiene, scarce availability of safe water, lack of efficient waste disposal, and insufficient health education (Bhutta et al. 2013; O'Ryan et al. 2011 ). In neonatal infection, the acquisition of the pathogen may occur by different ways: through the contaminated birth canal during the first days of life, or, especially in the nosocomial setting, through the use of contaminated tools, objects, or milk, and through the hands of the caregivers (O'Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013) .

According to the WHO, diarrhea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than what is considered normal for a given individual (WHO 2014). In the neonatal period, it may be difficult to define a diarrhea, since the feces of infants (especially when breastfed) may be relatively frequent, soft-liquid, and with large variability between subjects (Ciccarelli et al. 2013 ). In the diagnosis of GE, the previous bowel habits and the general condition of the newborn should therefore be taken into account. Typically, the GE of the neonatal period are acute, self-limiting diseases and are mild to moderate in severity. The presence of a pathogen in the intestinal tract can also result in colonization in the absence of disease. The virulence of the microorganism, the amount of the inoculum and several individual factors (e.g., prematurity, low birth weight, malnutrition, etc.) affect both the risk and severity of the disease. The clinical presentation may vary widely and some accompanying symptoms may be fever, vomiting, food refusal, dehydration, abdominal distension, and lethargy. In the management of GE, it is essential to assess the degree of dehydration and the type of diarrhea (watery or bloody), which is a relevant correlate of the presence of invasive pathogens. The risk of dehydration in children is very high and can rapidly lead to hypovolemic shock and death, regardless of the etiology. For certain bacterial infections, intestinal and extraintestinal complications are also possible (Table 2) (Bhutta et al. 2013; O'Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013) . It should be noted that while the occurrence of diarrhea in the neonatal age is generally caused by acute gastrointestinal infections, differential diagnosis with several other diseases should be considered (Table 3) . In particular, it should be emphasized that diarrhea may be one of the several clinical signs of severe systemic bacterial or viral infections. The occurrence of more episodes of diarrhea in highly endemic areas, or during malnutrition, may lead to chronic diarrhea that impacts the growth and development of the child. Stunting may in turn lead to subsequent disability. Moreover, after an acute episode of GE, it is not uncommon to observe persistent diarrhea due to secondary deficiency of disaccharidases (O'Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 487, "end": 510, "text": "(Ciccarelli et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1678, "text": "(Bhutta et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1698, "text": "O'Ryan et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1722, "text": "Ciccarelli et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2453, "end": 2473, "text": "(O'Ryan et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2474, "end": 2496, "text": "Ciccarelli et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1648, "end": 1657, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}, {"start": 1932, "end": 1941, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF7"}], "section": "Clinical Aspects"}, {"text": "In the case of newborns with acute diarrhea, the probability of a gastrointestinal infectious cause is very high.

The assessment of the degree of dehydration, the severity of the clinical picture, and differential diagnostic possibilities are the cornerstone of the management of every acute diarrhea (O'Ryan et al. 2011; Ciccarelli et al. 2013) . The etiological diagnosis is based on the demonstration of the microorganism (or its toxins) in stools, although in many cases of mild GE it is not essential, since the disease is usually self-limited. In more severe cases, it is relevant to identify etiologies that may benefit from antibiotic therapy in addition to rehydration. In this regard, especially in countries with limited economic and diagnostic resources, clinical criteria differentiating watery versus bloody diarrhea are relevant in order to initiate empiric antibiotic treatment of invasive pathogens (Table 1) . For this purpose, the microscopic search for mucous or leukocytes in the stool may be useful. In relation to the diagnosis performed by the microbiology laboratory, it is important to underline that standard stool cultures do not allow to identify pathogenic strains of E. coli, for which more complex diagnostic methods are required, available in reference centers only. For some pathogens (e.g., Yersinia, Aeromonas), the laboratory must be informed for the need to use specific culture media or assays which are not included in the routine workflows.

For this reason, the assessment of the degree of dehydration is the cornerstone in the management of any diarrhea. According to current WHO recommendations, oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is considered the treatment of choice to replace fluid and electrolyte losses caused by diarrhea in children with mild to moderate dehydration (Ciccarelli et al. 2013; WHO 2014) . Despite its proven efficacy, ORT remains underused (Piescik-Lech et al. 2013) . Different oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are available generally with low osmolarity (210-250 mOsm/L) and variable concentration of sodium, sugar, and other electrolytes (Ciccarelli et al. 2013) . Efforts to improve the palatability and the efficacy of ORS are still continuing (Piescik-Lech et al. 2013) . In case of patients unable to drink or persistently vomiting, the introduction of ORT via a nasogastric tube can be considered. Intravenous rehydration is the treatment of choice in cases of failure of ORT, as well as for patients with severe dehydration (see \u25b6 Chap. 87, \"Rehydration After Diarrhea in Newborns\"). The hospitalization of an infant with diarrhea is recommended in cases of moderate to severe dehydration or in the presence of bloody diarrhea or systemic symptoms. Continuation of breastfeeding is strongly recommended, and formulated milk interruption is controversial, since enteral nutrition seems to favor the recovery of intestinal functions (WHO 2014; Piescik-Lech et al. 2013) . Diarrhea is associated with significant zinc loss, and the use of zinc supplementation can reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea in children. In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of moderate malnutrition is high, zinc supplementation may be of benefit in children aged 6 months or older. For this reason, WHO recommends zinc supplementation in children with GE (WHO 2014).

The use of antibiotics is still debated for some etiologies (EPEC, ETEC, etc.), contraindicated in other (EHEC) or recommended in the presence of some enteroinvasive pathogens (Salmonella NT, Campylobacter, Shigella), or other microorganisms (Vibrio cholerae, C. difficile).

Antibacterial substances, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, phagocytes, and specific immunoglobulins, are responsible for the protective role of breast milk.
