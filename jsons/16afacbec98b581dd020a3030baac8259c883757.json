To respond to the present and expected influx of patients needing a period of intensive care (2) , the short-term priority has been directing available material and human resources toward sectors dispensing care for Covid-19 patients (3, 4) . This policy has entailed the almost complete de-scheduling of non-urgent surgery (5) . More than a month now after the start of the epidemic, there is a pressing need to manage other health disorders not linked to Covid-19 but for which deferral of surgery until after the epidemic is over could worsen prognosis or be life-threatening. It is also important to be thinking now about the conditions under which surgery can be resumed at a normal pace after the epidemic. General rules have been put out nationally and implemented by each healthcare center, both public and private, throughout France. Specific guidelines have been proposed for visceral surgery (6) . Likewise, to meet their need for specific guidelines, the Frenchspeaking Association of Endocrine Surgery (AFCE) brought together a group of experts to propose principles for the surgical management of thyroid, parathyroid, endocrine pancreas and adrenal pathologies during the Covid-19 epidemic and afterwards, when surgical activity will be able to return gradually to its normal pattern. These guidelines were drafted in the light of the existing literature. They will be updated as knowledge advances.",

In the Covid-19 epidemic setting, its scheduling depends on the presence or absence of severe hypercalcemia, defined by a very high level of blood calcium > 3.5 mmol/l (140 mg/l) (17) , and/or the presence of clinical complications -acute pancreatitis secondary to HPT, brown tumor, calciphylaxis, fracture osteopenia, heart rhythm disorders (QT shortening on ECG, bradycardia with risk of asystole) with cardiac insufficiency (17) (18) (19) (20) . In all cases, hypocalcemia treatment must first be given. In the epidemic setting, the use of cinacalcet is recommended (21) . In cases of severe hypercalcemia, surgery must be scheduled as semiurgent, without waiting for the epidemic to end, or as urgent when it escapes control by the medical treatment. If there is no severe hypercalcemia, surgery can be deferred without risk until the epidemic is over. These guidelines are valid for cases of genetically determined primary HPT. For tertiary HPT, the blood calcium threshold defining severe hypercalcemia must be lowered to 2.8 mmol/l to protect renal grafts (nephrocalcinosis, acute tubular necrosis, lithiasis) and bone and vascular impact (22, 23) . For secondary HPT, surgical treatment is not recommended during the epidemic because of the higher risk of Covid-19",
