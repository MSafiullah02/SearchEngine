            "text": "Involvement of viruses in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases mediated by autoantibodies, including blood diseases such as hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, has been reported both in patients and in experimental models [1]. In children, acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) often follows a viral infection [2]. Interestingly, the causative infection may be due to very different viruses, such as influenza virus, rubella virus, mumps, parvovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and varicella zoster virus. Autoantibodies that are secreted in the course of the infection opsonize platelets, leading to their destruction through phagocytosis by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and especially by macrophages. As a result of platelet drop, clinical symptoms including petechiae or, in more severe cases, bleedings, develop. Although it cannot be excluded that other mechanisms, such as polyclonal B cell activation, anti-idiotypic response, alteration of self antigens by the virus, or enhancement of antigen presentation might play a role in this virally-triggered disease, molecular mimicry between epitopes shared by platelets and infectious agents has been suggested to mainly explain the initial production of autoantibodies. A spread of this autoimmune response to other platelet determinants that are not necessarily shared with the virus may then be responsible for further development of ITP [3], [4]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, like gamma-interferon (IFN-\u03b3), that are produced at higher levels in ITP patients than in normal individuals may contribute to the full expression of the disease [3], [4]. However, whereas the involvement of viruses in the etiology of ITP seems well established, it might be difficult to understand how infectious agents that carry distinct antigenic epitopes may trigger, through molecular mimicry, an autoantibody response that is similarly targeted to platelet determinants. Although a relationship between autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and viruses has not been shown as clearly as for ITP, many cases of AIHA have been reported after infection with viruses as diverse as hepatitis A and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus-1, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, rubella virus and varicella virus. Thus, it may be hypothesized that different viruses trigger these two autoantibody-mediated diseases by similar mechanisms.",

Injection into mice of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies raised against platelets or red blood cells (RBC), including switch variants derived from monoclonal autoantibodies, allows the analysis of the different mechanisms involved in the destruction of these target cells [5], [6], [7]. Anti-platelet autoantibodies that are spontaneously produced in male (NZW\u00d7BXSB)F1 mice lead to thrombocytopenia [8]. However, this thrombocytopenia arises in the context of a complex autoimmune syndrome reminiscent of human systemic autoimmune diseases rather than of organ-specific ITP. Similarly, NZB mice develop an AIHA mediated by anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies that are produced concomitantly with other autoantibodies with diverse specificities, although through distinct mechanisms [9].",

Immunization of mice infected with LDV results in a faster anti-RBC autoantibody response, without enhancement of anemia [14]. Similarly, production, probably through molecular mimicry, of anti-platelet autoantibodies that react with a 145- to 155-kDa autoantigen follows immunization of some strains of normal mice with rat platelets, but the resulting thrombocytopenia is moderate and transient [15]. Anti-platelet autoantibody production has also been reported after interspecies platelet immunization in marmosets [16].",

Mice infected with dengue-2 virus develop a transient thrombocytopenia that may result from the secretion of anti-platelet autoantibodies, together with other consequences of this viral infection, such as paraplegia [17]. Infectious agents that induce polyclonal B lymphocyte activation, such as Trypanosoma brucei, trigger the secretion of autoantibodies that can recognize diverse autoantigens, including erythrocytes [18]. Infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) results in anemia that is of central origin in most animals and may depend on natural killer cell and CD8+ T lymphocyte activation and on the secretion of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1/\u03b2 [19], [20], [21]. However, in C3HeB/FeJ mice, the Docile strain of LCMV triggers peripheral hemolytic anemia that is correlated with the production of anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies recognizing the band-3 antigen [22], [23], [24]. Although this anti-erythrocyte autoantibody production apparently does not result from either molecular mimicry nor from B lymphocyte polyclonal activation [23], [25], the mechanisms through which it is induced by the infection remain to be determined.",

Moreover, complement may also increase the pathogenicity of some autoantibody isotypes [28]. Mice infected with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), a mouse arterivirus, display a dramatic enhancement of the anemia induced by the 34-3C IgG2a autoantibody, but not by the 31-9D IgG1 antibody, suggesting that the virus may increase the phagocytosis of opsonized erythrocytes [29].",

First, the F(ab\u2032)2 fragment of anti-platelet polyclonal antibody does not induce thrombocytopenia, even in infected animals, indicating that the Fc fragment, which is recognized by receptors that may mediate phagocytosis, is required for the antibody pathogenic effect [30]. Second, in vivo treatment with total IgG that block Fc receptors on phagocytic cells (IVIg) [31] or with clodronate-containing liposomes that suppress macrophages [32] and thus inhibit phagocytosis of autoantibody-coated target cells [15], [33], [34], prevents the development of antibody-mediated thrombocytopenia in LDV-infected mice [30]. Third, histological analysis shows in vivo phagocytosis of a much larger number of erythrocytes in the liver of LDV-infected mice that had received an anti-RBC monoclonal autoantibody than in control animals [29]. Finally, the ability of macrophages from LDV-infected mice to phagocytose ex vivo erythrocytes opsonized by a monoclonal autoantibody is enhanced when compared to that of macrophages obtained from uninfected animals [29].",

As interleukin-12 is also produced in the course of LDV infection [37], it may be postulated that a cascade of cell activation and cytokine production leads to IFN-\u03b3 secretion. Natural killer cells have been identified as a major source for the secretion of this cytokine after infection with this virus [38]. IFN-\u03b3 is involved in the exacerbation of autoantibody-mediated hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia induced by LDV, as shown by disease prevention in mice deficient for its receptor (G129 mice; [30]; Table 1).",
