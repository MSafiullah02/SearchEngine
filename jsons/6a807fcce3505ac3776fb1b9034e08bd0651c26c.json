Prophylaxis with m336 resulted in a reduction of pulmonary viral RNA titers by 40-9000-fold, compared with an irrelevant control antibody with little to no inflammation or viral antigen detected.

While mice are not naturally susceptible to experimental infection with MERS-CoV, several models have been generated expressing the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor. New Zealand white rabbits have also been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, resulting in asymptomatic infection that may represent mild human disease [7] . Rabbits naturally display a DPP4 molecule that allows for attachment and infection by MERS-CoV. Infection leads to pulmonary disease characterized by mild perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation, with viral titers peaking about 3 days after inoculation. Because MERS-CoV infection in the rabbit model can be monitored by pathologic analysis and viral replication, we evaluated this model for testing a potential medical countermeasure.",

Intravenous administration of m336 resulted in neutralizing antibody titers in the serum for several days (Supplementary Table 1 ), but intranasal administration of antibody did not result in detectable titers.
