            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic \u03b2-coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [1]. Epidemiological evidence suggests that dromedary camels are the main zoonotic source of MERS-CoV [2, 3]. MERS-CoV causes a wide range of manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infections to mild or severe respiratory disease. Detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies (Abs) in humans and/or animals represents a valuable tool in diagnostics as well as epidemiological, virological, and immunological studies including evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity [4\u20138]. Several serological assays have been developed and used for MERS-CoV, including ELISA-based assays, immunofluorescence assays, protein microarrays, and pseudovirus-based neutralization assays [9\u201317]. However, most of these assays pose several drawbacks and limitations such as low specificity and sensitivity, need for expensive and special equipment and reagents, and/or highly trained technical staff, which could limit their use.",

The assay has several advantages in detecting nAbs against MERS-CoV. It can precisely detect virus-specific nAbs in human and animal sera without the need for specific reagents or equipment, it can be carried out readily once the virus is isolated, and it can overcome strain-specific antigenic changes. The protocol presented in this chapter consists of four major steps, including MERS-CoV isolation, amplification, titration, and neutralization. The MN assay described here is suitable to quantitatively measure the titer of nAbs in sera from different mammalian species.",

            "text": "\nThe water bath is a potential source of contamination. To reduce the risk of contamination, keep the O-ring and cap of the cryovial out of the water.Frozen cell stocks contain dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is harmful to the cells, and it should be diluted and removed after thawing the cells and before transferring the cells to tissue culture flasks.After centrifugation, check the clarity of the supernatant and visibility of a complete pellet.Different volumes and culture vessels could be used. It is better to initiate Vero E6 cells culture in a T25 tissue culture flask. If using a T25 tissue culture flask, re-suspend the cells in 5 mL media, and if using T75 tissue culture flask, re-suspend the cells in 10 mL media. Vero E6 cells recover slowly after freezing and may take more than a week before they are ready to be passaged. It may take 2\u20133 passages before the Vero E6 cells reach their normal growth rate.It is important to monitor Vero E6 cells and to subculture them once confluent. Depending on the number of seeded cells and the size of the used flask, Vero E6 cells usually need to be passaged 2\u20133 times per week.To harvest or maintain Vero E6 cells, remove media from the flask, wash the cell monolayer gently with 3\u20135 mL of sterile pre-warmed DPBS without calcium or magnesium, and discard the used washing solution. Add 2\u20135 mL pre-warmed 1\u00d7 trypsin-EDTA in DPBS without calcium or magnesium to the cell monolayer and incubate for 5\u201310 min at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 to detach cells (incubation may vary, so check the cells every 2\u20133 min). After cells are detached, add 5 mL pre-warmed M-10 to the flask to inactivate trypsin activity, and collect detached cells in 15 mL sterile falcon tube. Make sure to centrifuge the collected cells and discard the supernatant. Then, add new 1\u20132 mL pre-warmed M-10 and re-suspend the cells by pipetting up and down using 1 mL pipette to make a homogenous cell suspension.Change the seeding density of cells when cells are under or over confluent.Use, Sterile 0.22 \u03bcm, \u03b3-irradiated syringe filters with small membrane diameter if sample volume is small for minimal sample loss. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001\u20130.1 could be used if titer is known. It is suggested to use small culture vessels (T25 tissue culture flask) for virus isolation from positive samples and larger culture vessels (T175 tissue culture flask) for virus amplification.CPE could be strain specific, and it depends on the strain and starting titer of the seed virus.Each tube should be used once only to avoid freezing and thawing as this can significantly decrease the virus titer. Use 1 mL aliquots tubes for virus amplification.Other dilutions such as \u00bd log10 dilution could be used.Change pipette tips between wells.Avoid cell drying by minimizing the time between media aspiration and adding the virus inoculum or the serum-virus mixtures.Alternatively, remove media from cells and fix cells with 100 \u03bcL ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Remove fixative and stain cells with 100 \u03bcL crystal violet (0.05% w/v) in 20% methanol for 30 min at room temperature, and wash cells in tap water. Score wells as positive for MERS-CoV (i.e., no crystal violet) or negative for MERS-CoV (i.e., cells are stained with crystal violet).For each serum sample, 12 \u03bcL are needed per single test; however, sera should be tested in at least duplicates, so more volume is needed. Different plates should be used when testing neutralization against different virus strains.Set up back virus titration to ensure working virus concentration is accurate. Starting with the working virus dilution (2 \u00d7 103 TCID50/mL), prepare twofold serial dilution in pre-warmed M-2 in a final volume of 60 \u03bcL (4 replicates per dilution). After dilution, add 60 \u03bcL of pre-warmed M-2 to each well for a final volume of 120 \u03bcL and incubate for 1 h in 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. Then, transfer 100 \u03bcL to Vero E6 cells in 96-well tissue culture plate and incubate for 3 days in 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. After incubation, examine the plate for CPE and calculate TCID50 using Reed\u2013Muench formula.\n",
