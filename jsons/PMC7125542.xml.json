There are more than 5 million people worldwide suffering from this disease, and there is no effective treatment or a cure. Most patients die from this lung disorder within 5 years of diagnosis (Verma and Slutsky, 2007).",

It is characterized by transdifferentiation of the epithelial cells, accumulation of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, formation of fibroblastic foci, and distortion of the lung architecture (Antoniou et al., 2007). The change of epithelial cobblestone-like morphology to myofibroblast phenotype through epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin with a concomitant disruption of E-cadherin junction are the hallmarks for IPF. Many patients, however, show little evidence of inflammation, and anti-inflammatory treatments have little impact on the disease (Willis et al., 2006).",

A renowned Chinese medicine to soothe the lung, CS is now often used for the treatment of respiratory diseases and strengthening immune responses. It has also been reported to be an antioxidant and an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Cordyceps extracts have been shown to relieve fibrosis in the liver (Das et al., 2010, Zhu et al., 1998a, Zhu et al., 1998b), kidney (Chai et al., 2009), and lung (Wang et al., 2007, Xu et al., 2011) through an inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 expression (Wang et al., 2007, Xu et al., 2011) and promotion of collagen degradation (Li et al., 2006a). The dried form of CS contains ergosterol, polysaccharides, glycoprotein and peptides. Adenosine and cordycepin (3\u2032-deoxyadenosine) are the major components (Li et al., 2006b, Tsai et al., 2010) and they have been demonstrated to modulate cell activation and alter cell morphology (Shin et al., 2009). Several therapeutic strategies targeting various stages of fibrogenesis are being investigated (Selman et al., 2011), and it is the objective of the present study to explore the target(s) of CS in the relief of lung fibrosis and to gain insight into its underlying mechanisms.",

All these cells under stress produce TGF-\u03b21 which activates characteristic accumulation of matrix proteins, mainly type I collagen and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in IPF or in animal models of BLM-induced fibrosis (Cutroneo et al., 2007). MMPs are a family of ECM degrading enzymes from inflammatory cells which play important roles in inflammation and tissue remodeling (Yoshimura et al., 2006). MMP-9, a member of the MMP family commonly associated with IPF, binds non-covalently to its specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), in a 1:1 M ratio. About 2-fold increase of TGF-\u03b21 and TIMP-1, and 5.8-fold increase of MMP-9 were found in lung tissues of BLM-rats, making MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance and accumulation of alveolar ECM commonly found in human fibrotic lungs (Kelly and Jarjour, 2003, Yoshimura et al., 2006). An increase in MMP/TIMP favors tissue injury, while the reverse may be associated with anti-fibrosis (Kelly and Jarjour, 2003). The quantitative RT-PCR was only performed in Experiment 2, in which lung fibrosis is alleviated at a decrease of MMP-9/TIMP-1 in a time-independent manner as shown in all CS treatment groups. It is, however, noteworthy that MMP-9 transcription was suppressed to a greater extent than that of TIMP-1, resulting in a significant reduction of MMP-9/TIMP-1 imbalance (from 5.8 to around 1.6\u20131.8 for all CS treatment groups), and thus attenuating the fibrotic injury of the BLM-rats in Experiment 2.",

Although antioxidative activity was demonstrated in Cordyceps, it is, however, unlikely the cause for its antifibrotic activity (Yu et al., 2006) because even N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a strong oxidant scavenger, can only slightly alleviate fibrogenesis when it is prescribed in association with corticosteroid for this incurable lung disease (Cottin and Cordier, 2008, Moeller et al., 2008). In addition, cordycepin, the active ingredient isolated from Cordyceps, did not show significant antioxidative activity (Yu et al., 2006), implicating current information about pharmacological activities of Cordyceps is insufficient to explain its underlying anti-fibrotic mechanism.",

In those studies, Cordyceps was given orally in either suspension or aqueous extract (Nan et al., 2001, Won and Park, 2005), ranging from 0.3 g/kg/day for 9 weeks (Liu et al., 2003) to 0.66 g/kg/day for two weeks (Wang et al., 2007). We have also demonstrated a partial relief of lung fibrosis in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) following an oral administration of C. sinensis powder at 0.27 g/day for 12 weeks (Hui and Chan, 2006). C. sinensis is the authentic Dong Chong Xia Cao, but other species, e.g., C. militaris, and C. martialis are occasionally used as substitutes because of their similar biological activities (Li et al., 2006b) and lower market values. Interestingly, similar antifibrotic results, including decreased production of TGF-\u03b21 and collagen, and restoration of MMP/TIMP imbalance, were claimed in the treatment of liver or lung fibrosis with extracts from different Cordyceps species (i.e., C. sinensis or C. militaris) (Liu and Shen, 2003, Nan et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2007, Won and Park, 2005, Xu et al., 2011). Some common bioactive ingredients across Cordyceps species may attribute to such activity.",

The significance of the present study is perhaps the finding of alleviation of lung fibrosis after the fibrosis had developed (Experiment 2). The results of inhibition of critical fibrosis mediator (TGF-\u03b21), reduction of leukocyte infiltration and collagen production, and the recovery from imbalance of tissue degradation and remodeling (MMP-9/TIMP-1) do not show significant difference among groups of CS treatments for 14, 21 and 28 day.

These cells lose their cell\u2013cell junctional protein, E-cadherin, and express mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). EMT is thus critical to the development and progression of fibrosis, and its inhibition is considered a chemotherapeutic target for fibrosis. A preliminary study did show reverted EMT by cordycepin at 80 \u03bcM but not by crude Cordyceps extract in cultured A549 cells in the present study, probably attributed to relatively low level of cordycepin (40\u201360 \u03bcg/g) and high cytotoxicity of other ingredients in the crude Cordyceps extract (unpublished data). A combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacological analysis of Cordyceps extract or its active ingredients (e.g., cordycepin, adenosine and others) in the prevention of EMT may provide an insight into the antifibrogenic properties of Cordyceps.",
