Throughout the process, the virus evades surveillance of the defense system including the tonsils and mucous membranes of various parts of the respiratory tract, goes straight to the lung lobules, and rapidly replicates to cause lung consolidation. Therefore, its pathophysiological changes usually start from the center of the lobule, which usually appears initially as small, frosted, glass-like shadows, or may diffuse to the surroundings, mainly under the pleura. In severe cases, the leaflets are fused into a large film, and even diffusely distributed.",

CT features of COVID-19 are diverse, including pure or mixed GGOs with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape, consolidations, and crazy-paving appearance, and they can be located in the central or peripheral areas of the posterior lungs, with peripheral lesions dominating their distribution. The hallmarks of COVID-19 infection on imaging are bilateral and peripheral GGO and consolidative pulmonary opacity, but almost 56% of early patients with COVID-19 had normal CT[14]. The features change throughout the disease course. As the disease progresses, GGOs may exist in the subpleural area of one or both lungs. Changes in CT may proceed rapidly with increased density of GGOs, and then progress into consolidations with perilobular thickening. Multifocal peripheral patchy areas of nodular consolidations and nodular GGO lesions can also be seen in subpleural areas in the lower lobes[17,18]. Chest CT plays a vital role in early detection, observation, and evaluation of COVID-19. Increasing numbers, extent, and density of GGOs on CT indicate disease progression[16].",

It may develop in accidental injuries such as traffic accidents, falls, bumps, and crushes, and is characterized by parenchymal hemorrhage, interstitial edema, and alveolar collapse, which potentially lead to compromised respiratory function[19]. The pathological changes of pulmonary contusion are mainly damage to lung parenchymal cells, alveolar and capillary bleeding, pulmonary interstitial edema, atelectasis, and pulmonary consolidation. Pulmonary contusion generally begins with mild interstitial edema after injury; interstitial hemorrhage occurs after 1-2 h, and becomes apparent after 4 h, subsequently with exudation of monocytes and neutrophils. Protein, red blood cells, and many inflammatory cells appear in the alveoli, and the normal alveolar structure begins to disappear. Normally, pulmonary contusion starts to be absorbed within 7-10 d, and could return to normal without leaving any traces. Therefore, according to the amount of alveolar hemorrhage, chest CT of pulmonary contusions can appear as patchy or disseminated GGO because of a large volume of alveolar blood and/or consolidation as a result of a large volume of blood in the alveoli; the edges are blurred, and the dorsal subpleural distribution is dominant.",

First, some cases can be improved. The extent or number of lesions reduces; the density of GGO increases and transforms into consolidation; and the edges of the consolidations become flat or contracted. The increase in the extent and density of some lesions may be caused by secondary alveolar pulmonary edema, increased exudation, increased mucus, combined bacterial infection, and the beginning of mechanization. Second, some cases show successive imaging changes, that is, some lesions improve and are absorbed, and new lesions appear. This may be caused by the delayed inflammatory response in some lung regions. Finally, some cases become exacerbated, showing an increase in the extent and number of lesions. There is a \u201cwhite lung\u201d change that pervades the entire lung, and the prognosis is poor.",

We believe that in the current epidemic of COVID-19, in the presence of strict mass prevention and control measures, special attention should be paid to trauma patients with pulmonary contusion. First, a detailed investigation of the patient\u2019s epidemiological history is required. All trauma patients should be routinely asked about their epidemiological history; if there has been any travel to areas with high incidence of COVID-19; whether there is a history of contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia patients; and history of contact with personnel in high-incidence areas. For medical history, a detailed investigation should be carried out on whether the patient has a history of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and contact with wild animals within 2 wk before injury. At the same time, all patients with trauma should undergo routine chest CT. If COVID-19 is suspected, nucleic acid testing should be routinely performed at least twice if possible. Even if the test is negative, if the imaging and medical history are highly suspect, the test should be repeated multiple times and relevant experts should be consulted.",
