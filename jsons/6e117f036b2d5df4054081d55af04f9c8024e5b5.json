This method allows identifi cation of proteins subject to degradation or upregulation in response to intracellular infection. It can also be used to study intracellular dynamics (traffi cking) of proteins in response to the infection. Here, we describe the analysis of changes in protein profi les determined in Golgi-enriched fractions isolated from cells that were either mock-infected or infected with Salmonella typhimurium. Using the SILAC approach we were able to identify 105 proteins in Golgi-enriched fractions that were signifi cantly changed in their abundance as a result of Salmonella infection.",

This technique was developed by Ong et al. [ 1 ] in 2002 and makes use of in vivo incorporation of stable isotopes allowing mass spectrometry (MS)based quantitative proteomic analyses. Typically, two cell pools are used for SILAC experiments: one with cells grown in normal medium (containing the \"light\" amino acids) and one with cells in medium in which one or two essential amino acids are replaced by the \"heavy\" isotope forms of these amino acids, allowing for the identifi cation of peptides from each sample in MS-MS spectra. After a few cell passages, all proteins produced by the cells in the \"heavy\" medium have incorporated the \"heavy\" amino acids. Cells in the \"light\" and \"heavy\" medium can then be treated differently, e.g., treated versus non-treated or infected versus non-infected cells.",

Schematic representation of the SILAC procedure. Two cell pools incubated under different conditions are used for SILAC experiments; one pool with cells growing in normal media (containing \"light\" amino acids) and one pool with cells growing in media containing \"heavy\" amino acids. Cells from the two pools are combined to a 1:1 ratio, proteins are separated and digested in gel with trypsin. Subsequently, the peptides are applied to a mass spectrometer (MS), analyzed and quantifi ed. Ratios are calculated between the \"light\" and \"heavy\" peptides, which refl ect differences between protein abundance in the two cell pools. Adapted and modifi ed from Oda et al. [ 2 ] by using a quantitative proteomics approach (SILAC) in combination with cell fractionation. We compared the protein profi les of isolated Golgi-enriched fractions from cells that were either infected with S. typhimurium or mock-infected. After statistical analysis, 105 proteins were identifi ed that were signifi cantly changed in their abundance in the Golgi-enriched fraction upon Salmonella infection.

As such modifi cations affect peptide (and fragment) mass, and mass changes have to be taken into account to deduce to identity of each peptide and fragment. All cysteine residues in the sample are reduced and subsequently alkylated using iodoacetamide, yielding a mass addition of 57.02146 amu on each cysteine. Oxidation, which can occur but does not necessarily affect all methionine, tryptophan or histidine residues, yields a mass change of 15.99491 amu.",
