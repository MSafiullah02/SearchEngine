These phenomena result in a drastic slowing down in the rate of the reactions, forcing the system in a long-lived nonequilibrium state with a sublinear decay in the density of the surviving particles. Since this type of process grasps the essential kinetics featured by the spreading of pathogen-antipathogen agents [10,11], or underlying the pattern formation of diverse chemical reaction [12\u201314], the appearance of subdiffusive dynamics may become inefficient for practical applications, which typically aim in fast mixing regimes.

Increasing evidence, in fact, is showing that the existence of multiple layers, joined with the possibility of modeling different types of cross-system interactions, results in novel collective behaviors whose analysis is still in its infancy [39\u201341].

We interpret the initial transient (t<tx) as the unmixed regime, where the reactions between A and B particles take place mainly at the boundaries between the networks (i.e., at the interconnected nodes). At larger times (t\u2248tx), the reactants penetrate more and more the two layers and start to react everywhere in the system. After this fast mixing stage (t>tx), the remaining particles are uniformly distributed in the system and their dynamics is driven essentially by diffusion. We find that the mixing time\ntx depends on the ratio q/\u2329k\u232a, where \u2329k\u232a is the average degree of the networks, according to the formula\n(1)tx\u221d\u2329k\u232aqlog\u2329k\u232aq,that we derive analytically for RR graphs and verified by extensive simulations on diverse synthetic networks. Since Eq. (1) is in marked contrast with a purely diffusive process, where tx would simply scale as \u2329k\u232a/q, we interpret the logarithmic factor as the reflection of a spontaneous\nrepulsion mechanism between reactants due to the reactions taking place at the boundary between the networks.

We consider two configuration model networks [42], composed by the same number of nodes and same structural properties, a condition that we will refer to hereafter as the \u201csymmetry\u201d of the interconnected network. Let us further assume the two layers are coupled by means of undirected interlinks, placed at random between a fraction q\u2208[0,1] of couples of nodes belonging to different layers (Fig. 1). Two populations of A and B reactants are then randomly distributed with initially separated concentrations, so that all the particles of the same type are placed on the same layer. For simplicity we assume that the initial concentrations of reactants are equal. To track the evolution of each population, let us denote by \u03c11 and \u03c12 the concentration of A particles in networks 1 and 2, respectively; similarly, let \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 be the concentration of B particles in networks 1 and 2, respectively. Having assumed equal initial conditions, we have \u03c11(0)=\u03bc2(0)=\u03c10 and \u03c12(0)=\u03bc1(0)=0. Moreover, by symmetry, \u03c11(t)=\u03bc2(t) and \u03c12(t)=\u03bc1(t) for all t.

For these substrates, we find that the same repulsion mechanism is obtained by both increasing \u2329k\u232a or decreasing q, as one might expect since a particle hopping to a node which is cross coupled to the other layer will diffuse to it with probability q/\u2329k\u232a.

[30] by Garas, where the same system was investigated from the more general perspective of different strategies of cross-system interactions. However, by contrast with the conclusions drown in Ref. [30], here we have shown that in the limit of low enough fractions of interconnected nodes, an initial separation of reactants generally leads to a spontaneous mechanism of repulsion among the reactants which, to the best of our knowledge, has been so far overlooked. Next, we investigate the effects that different values of the effective transmission probability q/\u2329k\u232a have on the mixing properties of the system, so as to verify the accuracy of the approximations adopted to derive the relation (1) for tx. To evaluate this quantity, we have plotted the logarithmic derivative of the y axis in Fig. 2, and searched for the maxima of the corresponding curves (see Fig. 3). The time at which a maximum is reached defines the mixing time tx, sharply marking the dynamical crossover between the two regimes. As shown in Fig. 4(a), we find that the time tx for the A+B\u21920 process on ER (and equivalently, although not shown, RR) networks depends on q/\u2329k\u232a as predicted by Eq. (1). To further support this behavior, in the inset of Fig. 4(a) we have validated the logarithmic dependency of q\u2329k\u232atx due to the repulsion mechanism by comparing the pattern observed with the constant behavior that one would have found in the case of a purely diffusive process. By performing the same analysis on heterogeneous (SF and SR) networks, we find that the mixing time tx surprisingly follows the behavior predicted by the mean-field theory for homogeneous structures [Fig. 4(b)], although with slightly less accuracy. We trace the origin of this result to the fact that, in our model, low-degree nodes are indeed the most important ones for reactions to occur between the two populations, as they most likely carry the cross connections. In fact, as percolation results would suggest [47], the probability of picking a hub at random is very low in SF or SR networks, making the chance of having hub-to-hub interconnections even harder. In this respect, we expect that degree-based couplings among networks will likely tune the effects of the repulsion mechanism, leading to a faster mixing of the reactants for, e.g., hub-to-hub couplings.\n\n",

In this work we have studied, both numerically and analytically, the dynamics of an A+B\u21920 process on a pair of randomly coupled networks, where reactants are initially separated. For small enough values of the fraction q of interconnected nodes between the layers, we have found that the inverse particle density scales linearly at short times and then crosses over to a second linear regime at time tx. As the crossover determines the time at which the two populations start to extensively mix, we have analyzed the dependence of the mixing time tx on the effective diffusion rate q~=q/\u2329k\u232a, unveiling a repulsive mechanism whose spontaneous emergence delays the mixing of the reactants. We gave numerical evidence that, on randomly coupled synthetic networks, this effect does not show a sensitive dependence on the heterogeneity of the underlying topology, but it is in fact dominated by nodes with low connectivity. Whether or not the same behavior will appear on networks with targeted (e.g., hub-to-hub, or non-hub-to-hub) interconnections [48] or on more realistic structures having, e.g., a spatial embedding or degree-degree correlations, remains an intriguing question calling for further investigations. Moreover, since the diffusion-controlled annihilation process adopted in this work can be considered as an archetypal model for reaction kinetics [49], we believe that these results will inspire the investigation of the effects that the initial distribution of reactants, together with the mesoscopic architecture of the interconnected network, will have on the pattern formation in more elaborated and realistic spreading models [10,50], enlarging in this way our understanding of the interplay between structure and dynamics.",
