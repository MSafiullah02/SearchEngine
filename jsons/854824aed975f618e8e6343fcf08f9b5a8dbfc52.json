Currently, more than 1.6 million individuals are infected, and several thousand are dead across the globe because of Covid-19. Here, we utilized the in-silico approaches to identify possible protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. Potential compounds were screened from the CHEMBL database, ZINC database, FDA approved drugs and molecules under clinical trials. Our study is based on 6Y2F and 6W63 co-crystallized structures available in the protein data bank (PDB). Seven hundred compounds from ZINC/CHEMBL databases and fourteen hundred compounds from drug-bank were selected based on positive interactions with the reported binding site. All the selected compounds were subjected to standard-precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP) mode of docking. Generated docked poses were carefully visualized for known interactions within the binding site. Molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations were performed to screen the best compounds based on docking scores and binding energy values. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out on four selected compounds from the CHEMBL database to validate the stability and interactions. MD simulations were also performed on the PDB structure 6YF2F to understand the differences between screened molecules and co-crystallized ligand. We screened 300 potential compounds from various databases, and 66 potential compounds from FDA approved drugs. Cobicistat, ritonavir, lopinavir, and darunavir are in the top screened molecules from FDA approved drugs. The screened drugs and molecules may be helpful in fighting with SARS-CoV-2 after further studies.",

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses causing mild to severe cold such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Cascella et al., 2020) . Many coronaviruses are zoonotic, i.e. they get transmitted from animals to humans. However, the SARS coronavirus is believed to be an animal-oriented virus (Cascella et al., 2020) . In 2002, the first SARS infection in a human was reported in Guangdong province of South China. MERS coronavirus was transferred to humans from a camel in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Omrani et al., 2015) .",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads primarily through droplets, saliva, or discharges from the nose of an infected person after sneezing or coughing. Worldwide more than 1.6 million cases have been registered, and several thousand people lost their lives due to Covid-19 (Worldometer 10/04/2020). Important to note that approximately 370,000 people recovered from this disease to date (Worldometer 10/04/2020). At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments available for this disease. Many clinical trials and efforts are being made to provide potential therapies (ECT Register, 2020) . Any traditional drug discovery program is a costly and timeconsuming process that sometimes takes decades to complete (Romano & Tatonetti, 2019) . Thus, we cannot afford to wait for the discovery of medicines for Covid-19 from traditional drug discovery. In recent times computational drug discovery program has achieved popularity and success due to its ability to predict potent molecules before their synthesis (Gahtori et al., 2019) . Data mining, machine learning, high-level quantum mechanical (QM), quantum-mechanical/ molecular-mechanical (QM/MM), and quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) techniques are useful to accelerate the drug discovery program (Lin et al., 2008 , Murty et al., 2008 , Srivastava & Sastry, 2012 .",

She also proposed a few compounds that could possibly be repurposed for the treatment of the computational methods to screen 687 million molecules to find inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Fischer et al., 2020) . Zhang et al. published a crystal structure for SARS-CoV-2 main protease co-crystallized with a peptide-like inhibitor . Peptides are known for their structural diversity with ease of synthesis and unique mode of action with limited off-target activity. Peptide-like inhibitors are widely used to treat several diseases like cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, etc. and have high success rates in commercial development (Beeley 1994) . Structural analysis of the co-crystallized molecule suggests that compound binding to SARS-CoV-2 main protease hampers the function of the protease and could be a possible target for drug development. The binding site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a combination of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues holding with hydrogen bonds in excess, Figure 1 . The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the maturation of viral particles, which makes it a potential target for antiviral drugs.",

This study provides a detailed analysis of essential residues and ligand-receptor interactions for the development of peptide-like structures as SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors. We screened 300 peptide-like structures from various databases. Interactions of four most potent peptide-like structures were further validated utilizing MD simulations. The chosen compounds showed strong binding affinities with residues inside the binding site and formed the strong H-bonding and salt bridge with residues. Docking analysis suggests that most of the compounds which are in the top 50 are hydrophilic and tend to form hydrogen bonds.
