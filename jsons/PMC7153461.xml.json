The following chapters were influenced by theoretical reflections, my life experience and my scientific training on three continents, at the universities of Antananarivo (Madagascar), Paris (France), Z\u00fcrich (Switzerland) and in Mexico ( CISINAH, UAM and UNAM). The influence of these three cultures with very different historical backgrounds explains my progressively broadened understanding of the global development process. The post-colonial experiences in Africa in the 1960s, the violence left behind by the former colonial powers, and the outcome of civil wars, corruption and destruction of irreplaceable ecosystems and species forced me to understand not only the physical functioning of the human body (medicine), but also its psychological behaviour that supports or obstructs a healthy human life (psychology) and avoids environmental destruction ( ecology). My understanding of the links between the human body, the mind and the environment (anthropology) resulted first in an intuitive and later an interdisciplinary approach to these four interrelated circles (body, mind, environment and human relations). Understanding the importance of these four study subjects triggered in me a commitment to responsible scientific and sustainable behaviour towards other human beings, but also to nature.",

As a key concept, which gave birth to the Constitution on the United Nations Organisation after World War II, peace and security continue to be debated after the end of the Cold War. Because the world is a complex mosaic of different regional and socio-cultural interests, which have produced different conflicts, the mechanisms of conflict resolution are equally diverse and often adapted to the regional socio-economic and environmental conditions. Globally, some common desires for peace and security have historically evolved, but others have been subsumed under the expansion of global capitalism, where market forces and speculative capital have taken precedence over the productive and trade activities. In response to this, the Copenhagen School of Rethinking Security (Buzan et al. 1998) has introduced a new approach to analysing peace and security (1.4).",

The end of the Cold War and the expansion of a single economic system under neoliberalism have also influenced the peace community. Peace and security approaches have widened and now include in their analysis societal, economic and environmental themes (1.4.2). The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP 1994) launched the \u2018 human security\u2019 concept, and in 2007 Oswald Spring added gender security (1.4.3). Different multilateral organisations of the UN focusing on development issues introduced several sectorial approaches of security (Brauch et al. 2009). In the face of famine, FAO (1983) explored the concept of \u2018 food security\u2019. After several oil crises and price hikes during the 1970s, the newly established International\nEnergy\nAgency (IEA 1994) introduced the concept of \u2018 energy security\u2019. In The Hague in 2000 the third World Water Forum proposed a ministerial understanding of \u2018 water security\u2019, and in 2007 the WHO emphasised the need for public \u2018health security\u2019. These specific security concepts were interpreted as being part of a sectorial approach. Finally, the World Economic Forum (2011) linked together water, food and energy security with a nexus approach, but without defining the conceptual reach of security (Oswald Spring 2016).",

The so-called Third World countries, today understood as the Global South, were unable to integrate organically into the globalisation process. The structural dependency from the former occidental powers through colonialism and neo-colonialism produced a process of underdevelopment (Chapters 9 and 10 in PAHSEP 17). Their abundant natural resources (oil, gas, minerals, wood, etc.) made them attractive to multinational enterprises, which often polluted soils, air and water and exploited the resources at the cost of destroying ecosystem services, changing landscapes and making many local people poorer and poorer. Further, the massive use of fossil oil in the industrialised countries produced negative impacts of climate change and strong disasters in many developing countries ( IPCC 2012, 2014a). Often, local people lost their homes, family members and livelihoods through floods, drought, landslides, hurricanes and forest fires, and were obliged to migrate within their country or abroad.",

Since 1975, when the First UN Conference on Women occurred in Mexico, I have been actively involved with female peasants, marginalised urban people and academic experts to collectively think about these structural mechanisms of discrimination and exploitation related to patriarchy. As a new reconceptualisation of security (Oswald Spring/Brauch 2009), I introduce the gender perspective and explore the peace potential of different security approaches, where the understanding of the root causes of violence might offer an alternative way to deal with violence, destruction, exploitation and subordination. Thus, equality, equity and sustainability combined with peaceful negotiation and win-win outcomes for all involved, including the environment, might offer a pathway out of the devastation of human relations and nature.",

I am still convinced that gender must be securitised, due to the existing intrafamiliar violence and the lack of legal reinforcement in most parts of the world that is reflected in the male-dominated judicial system (Buscaglia 2013), but also that peace and security must be engendered (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-38569-9_11). I believe that security should be embedded in a deepened and widened security approach (Buzan et al. 1998) to overcome the present environmental, economic, societal, gender and human destruction. This Human, Gender and Environmental Security ( HUGE) security concept (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-38569-9_11), explores an integrated view that links up exploitation, violence, inequality and discrimination against women, indigenous people, children and other powerless humans with similar mechanisms that are used to exploit and destroy nature. I have been influenced by ecofeminism (Mies 1968; Warren 1997) that not only analysed, from a cross-cultural, interdisciplinary and anticolonial perspective the destruction of humankind and nature, but also proposed alternatives to overcome this destructive behaviour.",

Multinational enterprises (Monsanto merged with Bayer) had established a monopoly on agrochemicals and GM-seeds, and worldwide governments and international organisations ( FAO, WB) supported this type of industrial agriculture. The result of this unnatural production has been biodiversity loss, soil depletion, erosion and food crisis in several developing countries, especially in the drylands in Africa. Therefore, from a bottom-up perspective, in collaboration with several ecofeminists I experimented with an organic agricultural subsistence approach1 as an alternative to produce safe food for poor people despite the dominant patriarchal and capitalist system (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-38569-9_15). This subsistence approach was further developed by Via Campesina (2002) \u2013 a world association of peasant organisations \u2013 with its concept of food sovereignty (Oswald Spring 2009), which we also are promoting in the Peasant University of the South (Universidad Campesina del Sur). Via Campesina (1996, 2016) also promoted the interchange of native seeds among peasants from all over the world to avoid the spread of genetically modified organisms and the payment of seed patents (Oswald Spring 2011b). Recently, due to the drastic loss of natural soil fertility, desertification, erosion of soils, greater threats of climate change, especially in the drylands, and the persistence of hunger in developing countries, FAO (2013, 2016) has promoted these organic practices under the concept of climate-smart agriculture.",

This organic agriculture also represents a non-violent way to restore the damaged environment and improve food sovereignty in regions and nations with severe food scarcity, bad nutritious habits ( obesity) and difficult climate conditions (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-38569-9_16).

However, the male mainstream of peace research has mostly ignored their conceptualisations. Inspired by these two exceptional women and after several years of research, I discussed the concept of sustainable peace and environmental security (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-38569-9_8). Later an engendered-sustainable peace concept emerged (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-38569-9_12). All these concepts not only focus on theoretical reflections, but should also serve as a tool for women and men from bottom up to strengthen their struggle for a more equal, peaceful and sustainable world without violence and peaceful conflict resolution or ahimsa (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-38569-9_4). The concept of an engendered-sustainable peace attempts to reach an understanding of violent patriarchal behaviour, and also explores alternatives in indigenous societies which have found ways to consolidate preventive conflict resolution (Mench\u00fa 2004), avoid violence and peacefully reintegrate criminals into their society (Rojas Flores 2004). Without a different \u2013 nonviolent and engendered \u2013 approach to humans and nature, there is no possibility of saving the planet and its people. An alternative peace concept must be holistic and address physical, social, gender and cultural threats of the dominant values and behaviour in the Anthropocene (Oswald Spring et al. 2014; Chapters 10, 12, 13). Climate change has also increased the pressure on the Global South and threatened not only traditional state security, but also the human, gender and environmental security (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-38569-9_11).",

Particularly exposed were vulnerable people in the Caribbean who had insufficient warning before the powerful Hurricane Maria, number five on the scale of Saffir-Simpson (the highest level), wrought enormous havoc, with the cost of damage in Puerto Rico alone estimated at 102 billion USD. Also, lack of water and drought related to climate change ( IPCC 2013) have created new a security danger and concern among affected people in several African countries. These unpredicted and more extreme events ( IPCC 2012) are threatening international, national and human security (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-38569-9_13). Therefore, climate change was securitised by different governments and the United Kingdom raised the topic at the UN Security Council in 2007 (Wisner et al. 2007).",

Nowadays, multiple countries in Europe and especially the US also perceive climate-induced migration as a national security threat which requires extraordinary measures, such as walls, fans, militarisation of the border etc. Different governmental reports have securitised the threat, especially the United Kingdom and Germany, but increasingly also the small island states in the Pacific and the Caribbean, threatened by sea level rise. UNU-EHS has started to analyse the inherent vulnerability, risks and challenges to human security (Brauch 2005a, b) by focusing on human security aggravated by climate change. This human security approach orientates the threats towards the highly socially vulnerable poor population in the North (Hurricanes Harvey in Huston, Katrina in New Orleans) and the South (Hurricanes Stan, Maria, Patricia, etc.), which have destroyed lives, livelihoods and productive activities.",

This securitisation process provided an arena for promoting mitigation measures that are needed globally to reduce GHG emissions. Further, IPCC (2013, 2014a, b) assessed the new knowledge with empirical studies, whereby political, historical, social and environmental themes were scrutinised to transform normal political behaviour into an urgent securitisation process. Priority activities of government and people try to avoid further disasters, loss and risks. These studies converted climate change into a matter of security. However, with the exception of the highly affected countries which year by year suffer from the impacts of climate change extreme events, the global audience continues with its normal behaviour. Political and economic deniers in the US and elsewhere, who reinforce their fossil fuel lobby, have done enormous damage to this securitisation process. Notwithstanding the small achievement in Paris in 2015, which will be unable to reduce drastically the GHG emission in order to avoid further risks and threats, \u2018business as usual\u2019 behaviour predominates, which is increasing the anthropogenic GHG in the atmosphere towards dangerous and soon irreversible levels. The agreed maximum of 450 ppm of CO2 emissions will be exceeded, as the Mauna Loa station reported 412 ppm of CO2 (NOAA 2018) in May 2018. Most of the industrialised countries, including China, are still emitting too many GHG, together with the low level of commitment and the rejection of the US for binding efforts of decarbonisation.",

These processes produced a decline in the international order and the traditional security threats. However, there was an increase in intra-state conflicts in Africa and recently non-traditional wars, such as the drug wars, happening especially in Latin America. All these violent actions produced unrelenting cost of human lives, survival, risks and threats. With its human security approach, UNDP (1994) put the individual, his or her environment and livelihood at the centre. Human security proposed a deepening approach to security that refers humankind as the main referent object. This approach starts with the individual, scales up to the family, the village, the nation, the region, the international and the global or planetary security. The individual is considered as the centre, whose security must be protected. Human security analyses many interrelated variables, such as economic, social, political, environmental and technological factors. The concept recognises that \u201clasting stability cannot be achieved if people are not protected from a wide variety of threats to their lives and livelihoods\u201d. The UN Security Council extended the meaning of the concept to international peace and security, which cover conflicts that are more domestic and with higher humanitarian impacts.",

UNU-EHS proposed to reduce the social and environmental vulnerability, to address the risks and to enhance the coping capacities of exposed people to adapt and create resilience for the upcoming new threats.

Gender security is socially constructed and systemic within the present patriarchal society, and it is normally taken for granted.

The source of threats in the first instance come from the patriarchal hierarchical and violent order, characterised by exclusive, dominant and authoritarian institutions such as non-democratic governments, churches and economic \u00e9lites.

Health security has similar problems (WHO 2007) when the providers are multinational health and pharmaceutical enterprises.

However, multinational food enterprises are more interested in selling low quality food at high prices and controlling the supply of basic grains to the Global South with genetically modified organisms. Their modern cluster approach to food security creates reliance on technology, production processes and chemical inputs, thus small producers in the North and the South become dependent on these technologies. But often such crops do not provide the quality of food people traditionally ate and need for a healthy life. Further, this industrialised agriculture has multiple negative impacts on soil depletion, GHG related to long-distance food trade, and impoverishment of small-scale farmers in the Global South because of subsidised agriculture in the Global North. All these factors are changing the food security paradigm towards a green agricultural food sovereignty, as promoted by Via Campesina (2013, 2016), and FAO (2012, 2016) has reinforced this paradigm shift.",

Women are especially impacted by the lack of water, health and food security, but at the same time in practice it is women and girls who are able to resolve this scarcity locally by fetching water, healing with traditional medicine and producing subsistence crops in their orchards. This sustainable food production not only has the potential to increase the nutritional level of the whole family, but also cares for the environment and may restore depleted soils which were previously exposed to industrialised agriculture with high agrochemical inputs.\n",

Farmers are then often obliged to leave their traditional village, migrate to shanty towns and lose their cultural links and communitarian support (Oswald Spring et al. 2014). Chaotically growing big cities in the Global South represent economic and cultural challenges for both governments and newcomers, who often are pushed towards the most dangerous and risky places to settle down. In this urban context, multiple anti-traditionalist movements rise. Some religious beliefs lose their link with reality, other movements become radical, defending their former lifestyle and well-being, some ally with terrorist groups, and other groups pressure the government to improve livelihood and environmental conditions.",
