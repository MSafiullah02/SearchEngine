            "text": "Social networks form phenomena that exist and evolve; they are dynamic. These phenomena have been realized and studied by the anthropology and sociology research communities since 1930. However, the recent rapid development in information technology and the internet has increased the interest in social networks and as a model they have been adapted to more applications and domains. Though researchers first studied social networks of humans, for our study described in this chapter we argue that genes and proteins act collaboratively and exist in communities analogous to humans, animals, insects, etc. They complement each other and collectively achieve specific tasks where some would have major roles appearing upfront and others may play minor background roles. However, molecules turn into aggressive actors when their internal structure is augmented; consequently, they may deviate from their target, change camp, and disturb other molecules leading to disaster. Such mutations may be uncontrolled and unintentionally occur",

            "text": "We witness the establishment of social communities as part of our daily life. Since the dawn of humans on earth they have tended to come together and socialize leading to social communities that evolved into the currently known nations. The existing communities could dynamically change by having new members joining and some of the existing members leaving. For example, it is very common for people to move from one country to another and even from one location to another within the same country. People may change political parties. Employees may change employers and even departments within the same organization. This natural phenomenon has been studied by researchers in anthropology and sociology from early in the twentieth century. Social network research today is multidisciplinary requiring expertise from anthropology, sociology [22] , behavioral science, psychology, statistics, mathematics, computer science, etc. Finding a balance between these domains of knowledge is by itself challenging and requires significant effort. We further argue that social network methodology is rich enough to successfully serve a variety of applications, including web mining [33, 51] , web services, personalized search, patient monitoring, biological networks [38] , disease biomarker detection, outlier detection, team work, wildlife monitoring, document and text analysis, database design and partitioning, traffic monitoring, homeland security, among others [25, 30, 46, 50, 52, 57, 58] . The analysis of social networks leads to valuable discoveries that may have essential social and economic impact. From the social perspective, the discoveries may highlight terrorism groups [25, 52, 57] , common hobbies, family relationships, social functions, occupations, friendship, disease biomarkers, etc. From the economic perspective, the analysis may lead to certain target customer groups, the development of drugs, exceptional weather conditions, unusual trends in the stock market, etc.",

Graphs form most attractive representation of social networks. The edges in a graph may represent social interactions, organizational structures, physical proximity, or even more abstract interactions such as hyperlinks or similarity, among others. The study of social networks has been extensively realized in the research community as we see more conferences emerging and more journals starting dedicated to the computing aspects of mining and analysis of social networks. This will then further interest in the field from more researchers who are willing to contribute to social network research.",

Realizing the social communities of dynamic and moving objects like stars, humans and animals, e.g., [25] might require less effort. The actors in one community share something which distinguishes their community from the other existing communities. The overall structure of communities is in general hierarchical. For instance, humanity forms a single huge community sharing minimal characteristics of being human. This single huge community is composed of subcommunities that have further distinguishing characteristics which recursively split into subcommunities by considering further characteristics until we end up having each individual family as a community. In the same manner in a cell all the gene products form one large community which could be distributed into smaller communities by considering more features of the gene products. One gene product may belong to two or more communities and it would have a specific role within each community. Finally, social communities are mostly dynamic (whether modeled as stationary or dynamic actors) [9] ; and hence the analysis of evolving communities is more demanding to cope with the dynamics of the changing network [9] . Data mining techniques have been effectively used to analyze and study social networks. The social network modeling framework described in this chapter is heavily based on data mining techniques.",

In general, data mining techniques are used for social network analysis where people who have similar social profiles are grouped together in social communities [47] ; for instance, people may be grouped into small communities based on their income and exchanged emails. Data mining also involves the process of finding correlations in the data. For instance, data mining is used by companies to target their promotions to certain individuals based on the individuals' purchase history; it can also be used in market prediction where it is possible to predict the market status based on the history. One of the data mining techniques successful for such applications is clustering, which has been extensively studied in the literature [41] .",

The former is called classification and involves two major steps: model construction by using training data to build a model which is tested using remaining unseen data instances in order to determine its accuracy. On the other hand, clustering as unsupervised learning process does not rely on predefined classes and training examples while classifying the data objects. It is the duty of the clustering approach to decide on the classes. Clustering has been successfully applied to different domains, including customer classification, web data, financial data, spatial data, explanatory pattern-analysis and classification, grouping, decision making, document retrieval, gene expression data analysis, image segmentation, among others. Objects are clustered based on some similarity measures, namely homogeneity and separateness. Determining the number of clusters is a problem common to most of the existing algorithms. Usually the number of clusters is user defined. The best number of clusters can be defined by running the algorithm for different values of the number of clusters, and then choose the most appropriate value based on majority voting of some validation indexes. We further argue that even clustering algorithms that claim to run without the number of clusters predefined (like DBScan) still require specifying some parameters that guide the clustering process; tuning and deciding on the latter parameters is equally challenging as deciding on the best number of clusters. In this study, we use k-means clustering algorithm, which requires the number of clusters as input. We decide on the number of clusters by considering the result from applying frequent pattern mining as described in the sequel.",

A gene can be defined as a string of nucleotides from the alphabet fA; T; G; C g, where each letter represents a chemical compound. Further details of genetics are out of the scope of this chapter. These genes are the functional segments of DNA that encode mRNA which generates the proteins. Genes form the basic unit for heredity and genetic material transformation. Surprisingly, recent research has revealed that less that 5% of the whole DNA sequence in human involves functional genes. The number of genes differs among organisms; for example, a human genome encodes approximately 20,500 genes, and yeast has around 6,000 genes.",

For instance, it is known that some proteins collectively function to maintain cellular protein conformation during stressful proteotoxic insults. Signaling pathways such as that regulating cell division can be thought of as a community. Likewise, investigating whole microbial communities instead of individual micro-organisms could guide scientists to answer fundamental questions such as how ecosystems respond to climate change or pollution. Actually, all the interactions between different organisms within an ecosystem must be taken into consideration in order to assess the environmental impact on microbial communities. This is not possible by following traditional approaches such as those which examine changes in gene expression of individual microbial cells. It is more realistic to investigate and analyze the gene expression of a whole community at once. We describe a model for identifying disease biomarkers by mining and analysis of social communities of genes and/or gene products. The discoveries from the study described here will support and extend our previous findings related to biomarkers [6, 7] . The social network of gene expressions is watched over time in order to study the behavior of gene products: how they change camps to assume different functions, and how they affect other molecules within the cell. We employ different data snapshots related to the same set of gene products and collected from the same patients at different time points. A social network of the gene products is derived based on each snapshot. The different social networks are analyzed to identify and compare the expressed genes. The outcome will lead to highlight the benefit or thread caused by the analyzed genes.",

The first perspective is frequent pattern mining where gene expression and samples represent items and transactions, respectively. We utilize maximal-frequent sets of genes. In our discussion of the machine learning applications, the set of genes is frequent when it satisfies a minimum frequency threshold by having the genes concurrently expressed in a certain number of samples. It is closed if none of its supersets has the same frequency in the analyzed snapshot; it is maximal-closed if in addition to being closed, none of its supersets is frequent. The second perspective is the k-means clustering algorithm where the number of clusters k is set to the number of derived maximal-closed frequent sets of genes. The coexistence of two genes in the frequent patterns is used to decide on whether to have them connected in the social network, where we use the term \"gene\" simply as a label for the \"gene product\". When the two genes exist in the same cluster, the weight of the connection is set to the number of frequent patterns hosting the two genes concurrently; otherwise, the weight is set to the reciprocal of the latter value. The weight is adjusted further based on a third perspective which considers the data snapshot directly as discussed later in Sect. 2. The constructed social networks from all the data snapshots are to be investigated further to derive social communities that lead to better identification of biomarkers, where we define \"biomarker\" to be a \"biological property\", and not in the conventional sense of a biological predictor of clinical behavior. Though our results reported in this chapter are related to cancer biomarkers, the approach is general enough to be applied to identify biomarkers of other diseases should the corresponding data be available for modeling and analysis. The latter study has been left as future work. Finally, support vector machines (SVMs) are used to classify the given samples based on the identified biomarkers.",

In a university environment the actors could be students and two actors are connected if they are enrolled together in at least 3 courses during the current semester. Analyzing the first network will lead to communities of drugs that are used together and analysis of the second network will lead to communities of students who study together during the current semester. The identified students may then have the potential to be enrolled in the same courses in the future. The latter piece of information may be valuable in developing a recommendation system for students to select courses such that a set of courses is recommended to students who belong to the same community.

This model is better represented using bipartite graph.

Another example involves students and courses as two sets of actors such that a student is linked to every course he/she is enrolled in.

They should be armed with the knowledge that will guard them from being deceived by people and organizations which are mainly terrorists who may misuse their expertise and knowledge.

First, people should be warned not to be deceived by terrorists who try brainwash them and to turn them into dangerous individuals. Terrorists try to approach people emotionally by using different factors including poverty, political and ethnic discrimination, and religious speeches falsely manipulated to suit the propaganda of the terrorists. Thus, it is possible to avoid losing the fight against terrorism by concentrating on effective ways to handle the factors mostly misutilized by terrorists, by opening new job opportunities that will eliminate poverty, by appropriately dealing with all ethnic groups to address their concerns and meet their reasonable expectations and by spreading the right and true understanding of religion. Misunderstandings of religion has always created problems and conflicts. It is important to watch out for unknowledgeable scholars who play with the emotions of the youth and motivate them to turn into terrorist candidates. This issue is going out of control where it is easy for anyone to declare himself as a scholar and start spreading poison into the minds of the youth. Preventing this would be much easier than recovering and cleaning up the mess created by false propaganda. However international coordination and collaboration will be needed to effectively tackle the problem, especially with the widespread of the internet based propaganda and TV channels. Equally important is to have people feel that they are equally treated and not discriminated against. Preferential treatment to certain groups is one of the main items in the propaganda of terrorists. Second, people should be educated how to protect themselves from biological weapons and how to be treated in case they are affected. The latter issue has been addressed to some extent by different groups. For instance, Bronze [21] describes potential vaccines and pharmaceutical strategies for either prevention or treatment of established infections. Blank et al. [17] discussed how to learn lessons from the anthrax attacks of 2001 in order to react better to future bioterrorism attacks. The authors also analyzed the effectiveness of the distribution of antibiotics before and after an attack. Binder et al.

On 8 and 16 genes, the classification error on the test set is zero. Jinyan and Wong [48] used new feature selection method called emerging patterns.

The first was combination of optimally selected self-organizing map, followed by fuzzy C-means clustering. And the second was the use of pair-wise fisher's linear discriminant. In the former model, 12% of the samples were misclassified and in the latter model 18% of the samples were incorrectly classified. Several other studies investigated the colon data set, e.g., [14] . At least four misclassifications occurred in most of the studies carried out. Many other groups have demonstrated the power of fuzzy logic in microarray analysis, e.g., [66, 75] ; but the main problem of how to choose the fuzziness parameter m has to be further investigated. Usually 2 is the preferred value for m. However, Dembele and Kastner [26] have shown that 2 is generally not appropriate value for all data sets. Our group has already reported interesting results regarding the better choice of the values of m [6, 7] .",

Given a set of actors which are the expressed genes in this particular study, our target is to find the links between them in order to establish the social network of the genes. This is possible by investigating the relationship between the different genes. Our approach is based on a unified framework that combines three perspectives, namely frequent pattern mining (maximal-closed sets of genes in particular), k-means clustering and folding of the two-mode social network that connects genes to samples. First, the frequent pattern mining process is employed to produce the initial adjacency matrix where two genes are linked to reflect the number of maximal frequent sets of genes that contain the two genes concurrently. Second, k-means clustering and the folding process are separately applied to adjust the weight from the result from the first perspective. Finally, we compute the average of all the values in the matrix. Based on the latter average we produce an adjacency matrix for all the genes by accepting two genes as adjacent if and only if their correlation value in the adjacency matrix is larger than the average. The adjacency matrix helps in finding communities of genes and the central gene within each community where the latter gene is considered as a disease biomarker.",

This can be done by a self-join of the frequent sets of items of length k, say L k with itself and then pruning from the result any set of items which has all of its subsets not included in L k . This process results in generating a much smaller number of candidate sets of items. Therefore, candidate generation consists of two steps: the join step and the pruning step. After the pruning step, the remaining candidates are checked by scanning the database to determine their frequencies. This process is recursively repeated until it is not possible to construct more frequent sets of items.",

A frequent set of genes is maximalclosed if and only if it is closed and none of its supersets is frequent. Based on this, we keep frequent sets of genes of maximum size. To illustrate the process, consider five samples and six genes. For each sample, we list the expressed genes as follows: s 1 D fg 1 ; g 3 ; g 4 g, s 2 D fg 2 ; g 3 ; g 5 g, s 3 D fg 1 ; g 2 ; g 3 ; g 5 g, s 4 D fg 2 ; g 5 g, and s 6 D fg 3 ; g 5 ; g 6 g. Assume the minimum support threshold is 2, i.e., a set of genes is said to be frequent if it is supported by at least two samples. Excluding the singleton frequent sets of genes, we could enumerate the following five frequent sets of genes: fg 1 ; g 3 g, fg 2 ; g 3 g,fg 2 ; g 5 g, fg 3 ; g 5 g, and fg 2 ; g 3 ; g 5 g. Out of these sets of genes only four are closed frequent, namely fg 1 , g 3 g, fg 2 , g 5 g, fg 3 , g 5 g and fg 2 , g 3 , g 5 g. Finally, only fg 1 , g 3 g and fg 2 , g 3 , g 5 g are maximal-closed frequent sets of genes. From this result, it is obvious that g 3 is the most important gene; it has the highest closeness, betweenness and degree centralities. Further, the three genes, g 2 , g 3 and g 5 form a clique.",

Then, we apply folding on the produced two-mode social network to derive a one-mode social network that covers only the genes. As mentioned above, the one-mode network is produced by multiplying the adjacency matrix of the two-mode network by its transpose. Two genes g i and g j are linked in the one-mode network to reflect the strength of having g i and g j co-expressed in the same samples. In other words, the one-mode social network of genes is a kind of weighted graph; the weight of each link reflects the degree of co-expressiveness of the two connected genes.

Using the same data described in [27] social networks are constructed at times 9.5, 13.5 and 20.5 h with 500 genes. The corresponding networks are shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 , respectively. To explicitly shown the change in connections, we also plotted part of each of the three networks by zooming in to shown certain genes where the three zoomed parts labeled with names of genes are shown in Figs. 4-6 , respectively. These figures explicitly demonstrate the changes in the network; and hence the change in the correlation between the expressed genes.

As reported in Table 1 , comparing our results to those mentioned in the literature it can be easily seen that the proposed framework is more effective and robust.

In this work, we tried to construct the social network of gene products by employing a three-pronged approach leading to a robust framework. For visualization, the reader may think of the simple model of two communities of genes within each cell-one community containing expressed genes and the other community containing unexpressed genes for each particular cellular response to a stimulus. The community of expressed genes could be further divided based on the particular cellular goal of expressed genes (cell proliferation, metabolism, synthesis of a particular cellular product, etc.). The aim of our methods is to define the representative genes by analysis of the social communities. Our analysis allows us to find weighted links between Fig. 8 The network of the colon data genes based on their co-occurrence in the outcome from the three perspectives employed, namely frequent pattern mining, clustering and folding of the two-mode network. The outputs from the analysis of the social communities reported the most promising biomarker genes. After demonstrating its ability to identify potential cancer diagnostic biomarkers, the same methodology described in this paper can be applied to identify potential biomarkers of other diseases.

The revised matrix M represents the adjacency matrix of the actual social network where there exist an edge between genes g i and g j if and only if M.i; j / > 0. After M is transformed into adjacency matrix, genes are clustered into communities by considering the overlap of nonzero values in the corresponding rows. Each gene joins the community where it has more overlap. Then, we determine the central gene within each community by considering the degree of centrality which is determined by computing two values for each gene g in a given community: 1. The weighted degree centrality of gene g, denoted D g is the sum of the values in the row of g in matrix M divided by the number of genes in the same community,say n c , The un-weighted degree of centrality is the number of non-zero entries in row g, denoted z g .",
