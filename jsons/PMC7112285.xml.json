Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly more common among patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level care.4 Other bacteria identified in CAP include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae.5 Less common bacterial causes include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These and other bacteria may be considered more likely in patients with certain risk factors (Table 1\n).6\n",

In adults presenting with acute cough, the baseline probability of pneumonia is only 5%. Absence of any vital sign abnormality (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate) reduces the predicted probability of pneumonia to 1%.8 A chest radiograph should be ordered for any patient with abnormal vital signs defined as temperature higher than 100\u00b0F, heart rate higher than 100 bpm, or respiratory rate higher than 20 bpm. Imaging should also be obtained for physical examination abnormalities of crackles or decreased breath sounds in a patient without asthma.10 Infectious Disease Society of America 2016 Guidelines recommend imaging with a demonstrable infiltrate to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia and to exclude other causes of cough and fever such as acute bronchitis.11 Although X-ray imaging is a mainstay of diagnosis of pneumonia, the British Thoracic Society recommends the entire clinical picture should be considered when making a decision to treat.12 A systematic review found that among patients who are sick enough to be admitted with a clinical diagnosis of CAP but have a normal initial chest radiograph, approximately 1 in 10 will develop radiographic evidence of pneumonia within 72 hours.8 In such cases, it is appropriate to treat the patient empirically for pneumonia and repeat imaging in 24 to 48 hours.11 Community resources and access to imaging may also affect decision to treat without imaging.",

The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) considers 20 variables to stratify patients into 1 of 5 risk categories (I\u2013V) based on risk of death within 30 days.15 Given the number of parameters required, it is not frequently used in general practice. The CURB65 assessment tool was introduced in 2003 by the British Thoracic Society.16 Similar to the PSI, it calculates risk of 30-day mortality, but instead only uses 5 variables (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age >65), with one point awarded for each if present, allowing for greater ease of use.15, 16 The CRB65 can be calculated without blood urea and thus is useful in the outpatient setting. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found no significant difference in test performance when comparing the 3 severity tools.15 It was noted that the PSI negative likelihood ratio suggests it may be superior in identifying low-risk patients, and the CURB65 and CRB65 may be superior in identifying high-risk patients.15 A CURB65 or CRB65 score of 0 or 1 demonstrates low risk of mortality and suggests a patient can be managed in the outpatient setting. A score of 3 or higher should warrant hospital admission. It is always appropriate to consider a patient\u2019s social circumstances and treatment wishes when making treatment decisions12, 16 (Fig. 1\n; CURB65 score12).",

A 2011 Cochrane review that included relevant CAP studies through the year 2010 showed that corticosteroid use accelerates time to symptom resolution and clinical stability, with infrequent adverse effects.19 Similarly, a 2015 systematic review by Siemieniuk and colleagues20 included studies from 2011 through mid-2015. Their analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials found significantly decreased mortality in severe pneumonia, decreased need for mechanical ventilation, decreased occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, decreased time to clinical stability, and shorter duration of hospitalization.20 Hyperglycemia requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with corticosteroids.20, 21 The most recent IDSA and BTS guidelines do not make recommendations regarding the routine use of adjunctive corticosteroid for CAP.11, 12 Given the variations in dose and route of administration, an optimal agent and dose is unknown. Further research is needed to determine steroid dosing and duration, as well as what patient populations are most likely to benefit from its use.20, 21\n",

Host factors that may explain poor response should be considered, including high initial severity score, risk factors for infection with unusual organisms, underlying comorbidities, or risk factors for multi\u2013drug-resistant pathogens (Table 5\n).24 In areas with high prevalence of HIV or TB, testing is recommended.30 Results of initial microbiological tests such as blood or sputum cultures should be reviewed, including any sensitivity data. Repeat blood cultures should be obtained in the setting of clinical deterioration. Additional laboratory testing for S. pneumonia and Legionella pneumophila via urine antigen testing may be performed, because they may remain positive for days after initiating antibiotic treatment. Additional imaging such as chest CT may be beneficial for assessing interval progression or improvement or identifying pleural effusions, lung abscesses, or pulmonary embolism. If pleural effusions are identified in a patient with treatment failure, thoracentesis should be performed to evaluate for empyema. In select patients, bronchoscopy with protected bronchial sampling or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be beneficial to provide diagnostic information for infectious causes and noninfectious mimics, such as pulmonary eosinophilia, drug-induced pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, or pulmonary fibrosis.11, 29 Primary or metastatic neoplastic lesions obstructing the bronchus may cause accumulation of secretions distal to the obstruction, predisposing to infection. Both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma can present with lung involvement, with typical radiographic findings of hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, but may also have a presenting pattern that suggests infection.31\n",

First-line and preferred agent is still amoxicillin.50, 54, 57, 59 Alternative agents are cephalosporins and macrolide antibiotics; however, increasing resistance to penicillin derivatives and macrolides should be noted60 (Table 10\n). Quinolones can be considered in cases where there are no reasonable alternatives due to MDR pathogens or when an oral antibiotic is deemed optimal.61 Quinolones have been linked to development of childhood tendonitis/tendinopathy, yet recent literature indicates these disabling side effects are rare.61, 62 Inpatient treatment guidelines have also been established (Table 11\n). Isolation of the particular microbial organism is ideal, but not required, in order to determine duration of therapy. Uncomplicated pneumonia treatment in the outpatient setting usually should last 5 to 10 days.54 Inpatient admission for pneumonia warrants longer duration of antibiotic therapy, typically 7 to 10 days of combined parenteral and oral therapy or at least 1 week after becoming afebrile.58 Complicated cases of pneumonia will require a minimum of 2 weeks of therapy once lack of fever is confirmed and may be extended for up to 4 weeks.58 The switch from parenteral to oral therapy may occur after 24 to 48 hours of documented lack of fever but is not always practical in complicated and/or ICU-admitted patients.63\n",
