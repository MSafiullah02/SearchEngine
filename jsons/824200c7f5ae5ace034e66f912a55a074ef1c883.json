In particular, because the concentration of extracted viral RNA from samples obtained during the early phase of infection is exceptionally low, the aforementioned problems would usually worsen. In most of the cases, we and others have found that the single-step real time RT-PCR methods (as suggested by the World Health Organization [WHO] ; available at http://www.who.int/csr/sars/diagnostic tests/en/) could specifically detect SARS-CoV but were unable to proficiently detect !10 copies of virus per test, suggesting that the conventional RT-PCR assay may actually yield falsenegative results.

Forty-six clinical throat swab specimens (1 each from 46 patients with suspected or reported SARS), which had been obtained during the period of April through May 2003 by contracted hospitals of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control, were randomly selected for this study. According to the WHO's definition (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/casedefinition/ en/), a patient with a suspected case of SARS has high fever (temperature, 138\u040aC), the symptoms of cough or breathing difficulty, and a history of exposure to or contact with a person with suspected or probable SARS. In our study, reported case patients are people who had symptoms similar to those of patients with suspected cases of SARS, except that a history of contact was not clear.

For the control experiment, viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of viral culture medium. The concentration of this control viral RNA was calibrated using the RealArt HPA-coronavirus RT-PCR reagents kit (Artus), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

The firstround PCR amplification was performed using LightCycler (Roche) with 2 mL of viral RNA diluted to a volume of 20 mL with PCR mix (LightCycler RNA Master SYBR Green I kit; Roche) containing 2 mmol/L Mn(OAC)l 2 , and 0.5 mmol/L of BNIoutS/BNIoutAs primers at the following settings: 61\u040aC for 20 min and 95\u040aC for 30 s, followed by 25 cycles of 95\u040aC at 1 s, 55\u040aC for 10 s, 72\u040aC for 8 s.

The sizes of the product were analyzed by gel electrophoresis analysis in 2% agarose. Furthermore, the sequence of nested PCR amplicon was subjected to sequence analysis with an ABI 3700 auto-sequencer (ABI) to confirm whether it was a SARS-CoV sequence. To reduce the risk of random or carry-over contamination of nested PCR [10] , sample preparation, reagent preparation, and PCR amplification were performed in different buildings or rooms with separated air-conditioning using different sets of the pipette system.

Using the single-step RT-PCR protocol, our firstround PCR yielded a minor amplification signal, although the nonspecific fluorescence signal background frequently occurred after 20 cycles of amplification (data not shown). In contrast, the second-round amplification by nested real-time PCR proficiently generated a signal of SARS-CoV DNA without apparent background, compared with no detectable signal for the negative control samples ( figure 1A ). In addition, by melting curve analysis, we could clearly define an average melting temperature of 84.2\u040aC for the nested amplicon of SARS-CoV, in contrast to no indication of melting temperature for the negative control (data not shown).

After 25 cycles of first-round amplification and 25 cycles of nested PCR amplification, our assay could detect a theoretical single copy of extracted viral RNA (figure 1A), suggesting its superior sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV. Nonetheless, for the quantitative assay, the cycle number of the first-round RT-PCR should be controlled to !30 cycles to prevent nonlinear amplification, as reflected by saturation of the fluorescence signal. We found that, for most cases, 25 cycles was the optimized condition for the first-round PCR to produce the most adequate amplicon level as the template for subsequent nested PCR. Under such conditions, the linear relationship between the copy number of input RNA and the threshold cycle number of nested PCR was accurately held within the range of 10 3 -10 0 in the semilog plot ( figure 1B) .

For those 2 possible false-negative results for the single-round PCR, we used direct sequencing analysis to confirm the positive results detected by real-time nested PCR. Furthermore, we carefully avoided the possibility of carry-over contamination by following the protocols described in Methods and by conducting 3 independent tests for all assays. Most importantly, we also confirmed seroconversion for the convalescent-phase serum samples for these 2 cases (table 1), further supporting the result obtained by the nested real-time PCR method. It is interesting to note that virus titers for the aforementioned 2 possible false-negative cases were actually quantified and shown to contain !10 copies of viral genome in the test. Of the 15 cases that yielded positive results by both assays, only 1 contained !10 copies of viral genome in the assay, indicating that the single-round PCR method may be insensitive for the low-titer virus assay.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 491, "end": 500, "text": "(table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Discussion. Our assay combines the 2-round PCR amplification method with the real-time detection approach to identify SARS-CoV, thus providing an alternative, sensitive means of detection of SARS. These findings reveal several advantages over the conventional real-time RT-PCR and/or nested PCR. First, the assay is simple and rapid. The conventional nested PCR requires arduous processing steps, demanding RT-PCR procedures, performance of nested PCR on regular thermocycler, and use of agarose gel analysis, tests that normally will take at least 4-5 h to complete. This dual real-time PCR method can be easily completed within 2 h using LightCycler, which includes a 45-min, 1-step RT-PCR followed by 40-min real-time nested PCR, making it an ideal routine protocol for high-throughput screening of SARS-CoV. Second, the assay had a detection limit of !10 copies of SARS-CoV, to reduce the rate of false-negative results for trace virus samples. In this report, we show that the developed assay is sensitive enough to detect trace amounts of virus in the sample, suggesting that this test is an excellent alternative to the existing SARS-CoV assay methods, which frequently generate false-negative results for samples obtained during the early phase of infection. Last, this assay allowed for quantification of SARS-CoV RNA in a range over a 3-log span. In theory, the 2-round amplification protocol can be optimized through the on-line detection system for linear amplification of viral RNA without saturation for quantitative analysis. Thus, quantitative analysis for detection of a wider range of values (14-log span) should be achievable. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a quantitative nested PCR assay for virus detection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Through analysis of 46 clinical cases using our developed assay in parallel with a commercial, single-round RT-PCR kit, we have demonstrated that our new method has efficacy at least equal to that of the commercial kit while possessing the potential for increased sensitivity for early detection of SARS-CoV infection.
