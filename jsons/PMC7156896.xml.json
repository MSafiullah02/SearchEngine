            "text": "A novel coronavirus named COVID-19 was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which caused infectious pneumonia and spread rapidly. However, there has been no consensus on the nomenclature of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) from the perspective of traditional Chines Medicine (TCM) so far. Academician Tong Xiaolin suggested that the disease should be named as cold-dampness pestilence (\u5bd2\u6e7f\u75ab) [1], and academician Wang Qi called the disease pulmonary pestilence (\u80ba\u761f) in the Manual for Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis and treatment of NCP [2]. In general, there is an agreement on the opinion that NCP belongs to the category of epidemic disease (\u75ab\u75c5) in TCM. As the special climate of Wuhan, where the local temperature in last winter was higher than that in previous winter, and the rainfall was more frequent than snowfall, the syndromes of NCP patients often presented the characteristics of dampness pathogen (\u6e7f\u90aa) in TCM. Integrating the analysis resulted from Professor Liu Qingquan and Dr. Xiang Qiong [3, 4], we consider that NCP (COVID-19) should be defined as dampness toxin pestilence (\u6e7f\u6bd2\u75ab). Dampness toxin (\u6e7f\u6bd2) runs through the comprehensive pathology of NCP. Even in Gansu, a region with dry climate, the researchers found that the characteristics of dampness pathogen from NCP patients were similar to those in Wuhan [5].",

In Ming dynasty, Wu Youke, a famous Chinese medicine doctor, believed that the pathogen of epidemic disease was different from the six excesses (\u516d\u6deb), but was a kind of pestilent Qi (\u75a0\u6c14) that had high contagious and powerful toxic features. Pestilent Qi is prone to encroaching specific organs and involving multiple organs failure, and commonly breaks out in populated large cities. In 2004, a clinical study including 524 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) showed that the duration of major symptoms in the group of patients treated by integrated Chinese and western medicines was significantly shorter than those in the group treated by western medicine alone [6]. The satisfied therapeutic effects of TCM in preventing and treating SARS suggested the superiority of TCM on severe infectious diseases.",

            "text": "TCM comprehension on pathological evolution of NCP and medication paradigm were analyzed based on syndrome differentiation. As NCP belongs to the category of epidemic disease, the pathogen is generally attributed to dampness toxin according to the main symptom characteristics of this disease. TCM believes that NCP locates in lung, and is closely related to spleen and stomach, and its pathological changes involve in heart, liver and kidney in the later stages. Dampness pathogen can change into cold-dampness (\u5bd2\u6e7f) pathogen following the Yin body constitution (\u9634\u6027\u4f53\u8d28), and also become the dampness-heat (\u6e7f\u70ed) pathogen following the Yang body constitution (\u9633\u6027\u4f53\u8d28). Clinical observation shows that dampness toxin can directly invade into middle energizer (\u4e2d\u7126) in partly NCP patients, and leads to the dysfunction of Qi movement. If the treatment method is appropriate and sufficient healthy Qi (\u6b63\u6c14) gradually recovers, the pathogen will be driven out, consequently the patient will enter into the recovery period. At the same time clinical manifestations appear some symptoms of Qi and Yin deficiency (\u6c14\u9634\u4e24\u865a\u8bc1). Thus, the pathological evolution of NCP in TCM can be summarized as dampness toxin invading defense exterior (\u536b\u8868) in early stage, and then enters the lungs and influences spleen function, eventually involves heart, liver and kidney, which causes Yang Qi collapse (\u9633\u6c14\u5916\u8131) by excess pathogen and Yin and Yang separates from each other (\u9634\u9633\u79bb\u51b3). If the treatment is timely and suitable, sufficient healthy Qi can eliminate the pathogen, syndromes with deficiency of Qi and Yin in lung and spleen will be manifested (Fig. 1).",

This view has been included into the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline of NCP (Edition 7) [7]. As the development of intestine and lung originate from the same source in embryonic stage, studies indicate that bacterial and viral infections in lung can affect intestinal microenvironment through the \u201cGut-lung axis\u201d. And vice versa, in animal model of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the intestinal specific bacteria (such as bacteroides spp) can directly transfer to lung through damaged intestinal barrier, revealing that these two critical and high mortality diseases have a common pathogenesis mechanism [11]. Sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome are also the pathological results of severe and critical NCP patients suffering from cytokine storm, which are the main death cause for patient [12, 13]. Previous studies have confirmed that intestinal microenvironmental disorders and imbalance of intestinal flora can cause the occurrence and development of respiratory diseases through the Gut-lung axis. Therefore, lung diseases can be treated by adjusting intestinal microbiota [14, 15].",

Some scholars have suggested that TCM pathogenesis of NCP is related to the \u201clung-spleen-large intestine\u201d dysfunction [10, 16, 17]. It has been discovered that Houttuynia cordata polysaccharide (HCP), a Chinese herbal medicine extract from Houttuynia cordata Thunb. can keep the intestinal homeostasis in H1N1 virus-infected mice, and protect the intestinal wall barrier, inhibit IL-1\u03b2 production mediated by Toll receptors, and improve the expression of IL-10, suggesting that the effect of anti-inflammatory damage is related to regulation of intestinal microbiota. As a main active ingredient of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and Coptis chinensis Franch., Berberine\u2019s bioavailability and in vivo metabolism are found to have close relationship with intestinal organic acids and microbiota [18, 19]. The doctrine of lung and large intestine in pair in TCM theory is similar to the Gut-lung axis in the theory of modern medicine. The most frequently used CMs for NCP patients in our study also suggests channel tropism (\u5f52\u7ecf) of numerous CMs belongs to lung, spleen, stomach and intestine. Therefore, CMs can achieve the purpose of relieving and curing lung diseases by adjusting the intestinal microenvironment balance. Moreover, it is not only one of the mechanisms of Chinese medicine treatment for NCP, but also one important approach to screen novel Chinese medicines for treating NCP in the future.",

Meanwhile, by comparing the QFPDD with the recommended formula of the first four stages [20, 21], we discover that the QFPDD has a certain integrity on the compound level. However, on the target level, the QFPDD has covered most of the predicted target of the recommended formula of the first four disease stages, and the mutual target from both two sources have a higher network parameter. The KEGG pathways enrichment results about QFPDD are consist with the effects of recommended formulas of mild and moderate stages as well.
