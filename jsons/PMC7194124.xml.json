            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the coronavirus family, is an enveloped virus with single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense genomic RNA that is about 30 kilobases long.\n1\n Spike (S) protein, composed of virion projections, is responsible for binding to a receptor and also for the cell entry mechanism of MHV. The cell entry mechanism of MHV is thought to be similar to that of human immunodeficiency virus or other enveloped viruses.\n2\n Four different splice variants of MHV receptor (MHVR) are known to exist. They have either two or four ectodomains with long or short cytoplasmic tails.\n3\n, \n4\n Two allelic forms have been reported: one is CEACAM1a, which is expressed in most laboratory mouse strains, and the other is CEACAM1b, which is known thus far to be expressed by only the SJL mouse strain.\n5\n, \n6\n Although neurovirulent MHV strain JHMV induces encephalomyelitis by infecting a wide spectrum of brain cells including neurons,\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n MHVR has not been reported to exist within this wide range of infected cells in the CNS\n10\n except for microglia.\n11\n However, in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that the infection of glial progenitors, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, was blocked by pretreatment with the anti\u2010MHVR antibody MAb CC1 or Ab\u2010655,\n12\n which suggested that MHVR is essential for the initiation of MHV infection in the brain. In mixed neural cell cultures, cl\u20102 induced syncytia in most of the cells including neurons.\n11\n On the other hand, soluble\u2010receptor\u2010resistant (srr)7, which infects and spreads solely in an MHVR\u2010dependent fashion,\n13\n infected a limited number of microglia marker\u2010positive cells and infection did not spread, indicating that microglial cells are the initial target for MHV infection and that the wt spreads from initially infected microglia to a variety of cells in an MHVR\u2010independent fashion, which suggested that MHVR is essential for the initiation of MHV infection in the brain. srr7 was isolated as an srr mutant, that is, the mutant virus is not neutralized with the soluble form of MHV receptor proteins. In general, the soluble receptor neutralizes virus infectivity.\n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n This neutralization may be due to the ability of the soluble receptor to compete with the membrane\u2010anchored receptor for virus binding.\n18\n Alternatively, the neutralization could be due to receptor\u2010induced conformational changes of the envelope protein, which can no longer bind to the membrane\u2010anchored receptor.\n13\n Although srr7 surface proteins show binding activity through the S1 region, an N\u2010terminal subunit of the S protein, to the viral receptor, similar to that of wild\u2010type cl\u20102 protein, srr7 is less virulent than cl\u20102. The reduced virulence and infectivity of srr7 compared with those of cl\u20102 could be attributed to the mutation of a single amino acid at position 1114 (Leu to Phe) in the S2 subunit of the viral surface protein,\n19\n which is not involved in receptor binding activity. This substitution in the S2 subunit could have brought about a structure less vulnerable to conformational changes in the S glycoprotein of srr7 virus compared to that of cl\u20102,\n18\n and causes reduced infectivity which occurs only in a receptor\u2010dependent manner, leading to the reduced neurovirulence of srr7 compared to that of the wild\u2010type, cl\u20102 virus.\n13\n The conformational changes in the S glycoprotein occur after binding of S1 to the receptor protein to induce fusogenic activities of the membrane\u2010anchored fusion subunit, S2.\n20\n\n",

Double staining by immunofluorescence of frozen sections revealed that some of the viral antigen\u2010positive inflammatory cells found in the subarachnoidal space during the early phase of infection reacted with anti\u2010CD11b monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 5a\u2013c). The viral antigen\u2010positive monocytes accounted for approximately 10% of viral antigen\u2010positive infiltrating cells seen in the subarachnoidal space at 24 h p.i. (data not shown). All of the SGCs carried the viral antigens (Fig. 3i), and most of them expressed CD11b or F4/80 antigens (Fig. 3j). Besides these inflammatory cells, viral antigens during the early phase of infection were detected in the ependymal cells (Fig. 3b) and in the fibrous structures of the meninx (Fig. 3a) at 12 h p.i. Later, at 24 h p.i., viral antigen\u2010positive fibrous structures were observed deep in the brain parenchyma (Fig. 5d\u2013l). These viral antigen\u2010positive structures might be correlated with the CD31\u2010positive blood vessel architecture (long arrow in Fig. 5f) or unrelated (short arrows in Fig. 5d,f), and also be correlated with CD11b antigen (Fig. 5a\u2013c,h\u2013l) or unrelated (short arrows in Fig. 5a\u2013c) as well. The viral antigen\u2010positive cells in the brain parenchyma which became detectable at 24 h p.i. with cl\u20102 and srr7 infection showed a conspicuous difference in the distributions of the viral antigen spread between those induced by infections with these two viruses. In the brains infected with cl\u20102, viral antigens were already detectable in the grey matter in the initial phase of infection (Fig. 3d\u2013e), whereas in brains infected with srr7, MHV viral antigens were detected mainly in the white matter (Fig. 3f\u2013h), showing close agreement with our previous report.\n21\n However, until now, attempts at the specific characterization of these viral antigen\u2010positive cells in the white matter have not been successful using anti\u2010basic protein for oligodendrocytes or GFAP for astrocytes (data not shown). Only a few of the viral antigen\u2010positive glial cells detected after infection with srr7 carried the CD11b antigen together with viral antigens (Fig. 5h\u2013l).",

There were no significant differences in the intensity or spread of viral antigens in the inflammatory cells between the two viruses (Table 1). However, 24 h after infection with cl\u20102, viral antigen\u2010positive cells in the grey matter with the shape of neurons were detected (Fig. 3d,e). Neurons do not reportedly express MHVR.\n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n In contrast, viral antigen\u2010positive cells after infection with srr7 were mainly distributed in the white matter (Fig. 3f\u2013h). Some of the viral antigen\u2010positive inflammatory cells found in the subarachnoidal space during the early phase of infection reacted with anti\u2010F4/80 or anti\u2010CD11b antibodies (3, 5). These antigen\u2010positive cells appeared in the subarachnoidal space prior to viral spread into the brain parenchyma, indicating that viral encephalitis starts with infection of the infiltrating monocyte lineage which expresses MHVR,\n24\n and that viremia contributes to the spread of the viruses. However, at 12 h p.i., the viral titers obtained from brains or peripheral blood of the mice infected either with cl\u20102 or srr7 remained at undetectable levels (Fig. 2). It is not clear where these infiltrating cells were infected. They might be infected at the site of inoculation after inflammation due to mechanical injury caused by the needle for virus injection. Blood vessels can be a source of secondary infection for infiltrated cells because endothelial cells express MHVR,\n12\n but it is too short a time for them to undergo secondary infection at 12 h p.i.\n25\n Another possibility is that circulating viruses in the peripheral blood below detectable levels could reach lymphoid organs, from where the infected cells might well target the inflammatory site in the subarachnoidal space. Actually, infected cells were detected in the red pulp of the spleen at 12 h p.i. (Fig. 4b). The abrupt extension of viral antigen localization deep into the T\u2010cell zone in the spleen after 24 h p.i. (Fig. 5m) might be mediated by a conduit system reaching to the splenic white pulp,\n26\n including to T\u2010cell zones.\n27\n Although endothelial cells express the MHV receptor and MHV can bind to endothelial cells via this receptor,\n28\n further careful examination is required to determine whether it is the infected endothelial cells that guide the extension of the infection into the parenchyma, perivascular fibrous apparatus comprising a conduit system, or if monocyte lineages play an important role. Infiltrated monocytes which stick to the blood vessels are often indistinguishable from endothelial cells on light microscopic observation.\n29\n\n",

However, the appearance of syncytium formation in circulating leukocytes indicates that the viruses are able to induce direct cytopathic effects on the infected immuno\u2010competent cells, leading to a rapid spread of the viruses during a very early phase of infection, overcoming the innate immunity of hosts, which is induced at the earliest step of viral infection through the recognition of viral components by host pattern\u2010recognition receptors such as the Toll\u2010like receptor family.\n30\n, \n31\n Interferon (IFN) receptor expression in monocyte lineage or dendritic cells can play a primary role in the early containment of MHV,\n32\n in addition to the role of INF production in infected tissue.\n33\n In the case of cl\u20102 infection, the rapid viral spread which can be accelerated by receptor\u2010independent infection of the virus,\n25\n possibly infecting receptor\u2010unexpressed neurons in the grey matter as early as 24 h p.i. (Fig. 3d,e), could bring about the death of infected mice in a very short time after viral inoculation within 2\u20133 days p.i. (Fig. 1). During this time, the host's adaptive immune reaction against the virus has yet to be initiated,\n10\n, \n34\n which mediates protection from lethal coronavirus encephalomyelitis caused by other JHM strains of MHV\n35\n after propagating a successful innate immune response, owing much to type I interferon production.\n36\n In contrast, infection with srr7, which spreads in a receptor (CEACAM1a)\u2010dependent manner,\n25\n does not induce such a rapid death of infected mice (Fig. 1 and Matsuyama et al.\n\n21\n), in the absence of infecting critical targets, such as neurons, in the CNS. Nevertheless, srr7, which differs only in one amino acid sequence in the S region,\n13\n successfully propagates in the CNS, shown by the compatible viral growth compared with cl\u20102 determined by a titration assay (Fig. 2). Therefore, srr7 as well as cl\u20102 infection could have induced a rapid viral spread in the infected CNS after effectively suppressing initial innate immunity through inducing cytopathic effects on the infected immuno\u2010competent infiltrating cells during the initial phase of infection, probably in addition to the effects of the nucleocapsid gene expression on the down regulation of type I interferon production, which alone seems to be insufficient to suppress such a rapid spread of the viruses after infection with cl\u20102 or srr7 reaching the spleen within 12 h p.i. intra\u2010cerebrally.",

            "text": "The cytopathic effects of the viruses observed as SGCs among infiltrating cells could have been induced by the infection of infiltrated monocyte lineages including phagocytes, because many of these SGCs carried the F4/80 antigen (Fig. 3j) as well as viral antigens (Fig. 3i). In some SGCs, monocyte\u2010marker antigens, such as F4/80, CD11b, or CD68, were not detected by immuno\u2010labeling methods (data not shown). The failure of F4/80\u2010expression in some SGCs could be due to the down\u2010regulation of the antigens. Many cytopathic RNA viruses, such as paramyxovirus,\n37\n vesicular stomatitis virus, poliovirus, and influenza virus, as well as MHV, inhibit the translation of host mRNAs while selectively translating viral mRNAs, and it is thought that this reduced host gene expression aids in the inhibition of antiviral responses.\n38\n None of the SGCs were labeled with antibodies for lymphoid cell antigens such as CD11c, B220, or CD3\u03b5 (data not shown), indicating that the majority of SGCs are derived from infected monocyte lineages. Among the other infiltrating cells in the submeningeal space or cells in the spleen, many of the infected cells remained uncharacterized, after using antibodies for the characterization of SGCs described above. The limitation of the technique to identify cellular antigen expression after MHV infection by employing immuno\u2010labeling methods in vivo is reportedly overcome by the in vitro or ex vivo analysis of CNS tissue culture\n11\n, \n12\n and splenic cells.\n39\n Further ex vivo and in vitro studies of infiltrating cells are ongoing in our laboratory.",

            "text": "The reason why SGCs became undetectable in the later phase of infection is unclear. One possibility is that MHVR (CEACAM1a) expression is down\u2010regulated over the course of acute infection with JHM viruses and restored following immune\u2010mediated virus control.\n10\n In addition to a blockage of the new infection of infiltrated monocytes due to the reduction of receptor expression, the host's immune response occurs during acute infection after 3 days p.i.,\n40\n through the contribution of CD8\n41\n and CD4\n42\n components, which may remove the infiltrated and infected cells in the submeningial space, where immunosurveillant cells can reach more easily than the brain parenchyma, and, actually only a few infected cells are detectable 5 days after infection in the submeningeal space, although many viral antigens are detectable in the infected brain parenchyma at the same time.\n21\n The association of viral antigens with blood vessel walls in the brain also disappeared after 3 days p.i. (data not shown), which is consistent with a previous report that showed no detectable in vivo viral replication in endothelial cells from the brain at or after 3 days p.i. with MHV, in contrast to the equivalent cells from the liver where viral infection of endothelial cells was detected.\n28\n The extremely rapid spread and the shift of the viral antigen\u2010distribution in the course of diseases induced by cl\u20102\u2010 and srr7\u2010infection demonstrated in this paper are distinct from encephalomyelitis induced by other types of neuropathogenic MHVs appearing in previous reports, and might be a cause of high virulence observed in emergent viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010coronavirus\n43\n or mutated influenza viruses,\n44\n which could occur after suppressing initial innate immunity within 12 h p.i. Therefore, we propose the manner of the rapid spread of infection presented in this paper, that is, the rapid viral spread from one organ or part of the initially infected site to another non\u2010adjacent organ or part detected within 12 h after infection, to be designated as super\u2010acute spread (SAS).",
