Anatomic brain abnormalities in infants with congenital ZIKV infection have been described in detail and may include microcephaly, hydrocephaly/hydranencephaly, absent structures (e.g., corpus callosum), neuronal migration disorders, severe cortical thinning, cerebral calcifications, and brain asymmetry [4\u2022\u2022]. In its maximal form, the severe anatomic abnormalities including severe microcephaly, partial collapse of the skull with overlapping sutures, occipital bone prominence, a small or absent anterior fontanel, and scalp rugae have been found to fulfill the criteria of a previously reported fetal brain disruption sequence [5, 6]. Because some of those features are rarely seen with other congenital infections and seem specific to congenital ZIKV infection, the congenital Zika syndrome as a distinct clinical phenotype has been postulated [7].",

Compared to infants exposed to ZIKV in utero, there have probably been a multitude of infants and children exposed to ZIKV by a non-congenital route. However, only a few reports have been published on the clinical course and long-term outcomes of non-congenital ZIKV infection in children [10\u2022\u2022].

Overall, in six of nine women examined (67%), ZIKV was identified in their breast milk by RT-PCR, and in four (44%), viable ZIKV could be demonstrated in cell culture suggesting infectivity (Table 1). Altogether, those studies suggest that women who have had a ZIKV infection shortly before onset of lactation or while lactating may be very likely excreting ZIKV in their breast milk that retains viability and hence could serve as a source for mother-to-infant transmission.\n",

Only one became symptomatic and developed a rash, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged subclinical hepatitis (minor aminotransferase elevation, 2\u20133 times upper limit of normal, resolved by age 4 months). Their mothers had developed symptomatic ZIKV infection 2 days before and 3 days after delivery, respectively [26\u2022]. The authors suspected that the infants\u2019 transmission most likely occurred by transplacental route or during delivery. As the breast milk was positive for ZIKV by RT-PCR breast milk transmission was considered but deemed less likely as the virus was not found replicative in the breast milk samples. Both infants were reexamined at age 32 and 30 months, respectively, and assessment with the Child Development Assessment Scale (CDAS) did not indicate any developmental neurocognitive problems [31\u2022\u2022, 32].

There is still a significant amount of uncertainty about the mode of transmission that may occur at this crucial time. The understanding of the placental and blood-brain barrier at the end of gestation is incomplete as studies have shown conflicting results. While it was shown that primary human trophoblast cells of full-term placentae are resistant to infection with historic ZIKV strains (ZIKV strains from Uganda and Cambodia), a contemporary ZIKV strain from Puerto Rico was able to infect human placental macrophages and mature primary human trophoblast cells [33, 34]. With respect to potential breast milk transmission, research questions regarding the dynamics of ZIKV viral load in the breast milk, exposure duration, and a better understanding of how often breast milk transmission may happen in affected populations in ZIKV-endemic regions remain unanswered [13\u2022\u2022, 35]. The current WHO infant feeding guidelines in areas of ZIKV transmission support breastfeeding. Unless any scientific data raise concern regarding transmission via breastfeeding, the current guidelines should continue to be followed [36].",

Reasons for this observation are not clear and may be related to health care seeking behavior and testing preferences. Overall, it has been estimated previously that about 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic [37, 40]. However, a more recent ZIKV seroprevalence study from French Polynesia estimated the proportion of asymptomatic infections to be 53% overall and only 29% for school children aged 6\u201316 years [41]. Descriptions of the spectrum of clinical characteristics of ZIKV infection specific to pediatric patients are still limited. For one, published reports of recent large outbreaks (e.g., in Yap and Colombia) summarized the clinical characteristics for children and adults combined only as aggregate information, thus precluding the opportunity to assess for differences in the clinical presentation and course of illness according to age [37, 38]. Moreover, in the report from Yap, young children <3 years were even excluded from the household survey component of the study that was meant to determine the extent of the outbreak and identify risk factors [37].",

Of note, gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea) were described for seven of the reported pediatric cases. One child had a concurrent malaria infection, and one a concurrent DENV infection. No particular complications were noted in the context of those coinfections. However, another case was reported to have an episode of hypotension, and another case an episode of hematuria. Complete recovery was mentioned for four, while the course of a 15-year-old girl with sickle cell disease was complicated by ARDS, hemothorax, and splenic sequestration. ZIKV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR, while test results for DENV, CHIKV, YFY, and malaria were negative. She required intensive care and subsequently died.

With a median age of 11 years, most (N = 9) affected children in this series were of school age, followed by two preschool children (3.9 and 4.1 years old), two toddlers (1.3 and 2.2 years old), and only one infant (6 months old). Most children presented with fever and rash and half had concurrent cough or runny nose on presentation (Table 2). Of those with complete blood count testing on presentation (N = 12), a third had evidence of leukopenia with neutropenia (N = 2) or lymphopenia (N = 4), while all had normal platelet counts. One case of a 15-year-old boy with a DENV coinfection stood out as he had on day 3 of illness a single episode of hypotension that responded to intravenous hydration and developed thrombocytopenia with a nadir of 74 \u00d7 109/L. This case illustrates what has been shown in vitro that DENV immunity may be associated with antibody-dependent enhancement of infection with ZIKV [50].

However, there is lack of pediatric data describing the full clinical spectrum including effects on child development as a result of the congenital ZIKV infection. Also, lacking are descriptions of ZIKV infection in infants and children acquired by a non-congenital route. Two cases of perinatal ZIKV infection have been described in the literature with no evidence of neurocognitive deficits after approximately 30 months of follow-up. Recognition of the presence of infective ZIKV in breast milk raises concern about potential breast milk transmission of ZIKV in endemic areas. Nevertheless, only one likely case of breast milk transmission has been reported, based on the isolation of an identical ZIKV strain in a nursing mother and her infant. Better understanding is needed regarding the pathomechanisms and incidence of transmission related to breast milk in ZIKV-endemic regions. The current WHO infant feeding guidelines in areas of ZIKV transmission support breastfeeding. Unless any scientific data raise concern regarding transmission via breastfeeding, the current guidelines should continue to be followed. Prospective population-based cohort studies to investigate maternal, perinatal, infant, and child outcomes are urgently needed, as results of such research may likely influence future pediatric practice.",
