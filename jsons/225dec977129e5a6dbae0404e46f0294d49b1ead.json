            "text": "Objectives: The December 2019 outbreak of coronavirus has once again thrown the vexed issue of quarantine into the spotlight, with many countries asking their citizens to 'self-isolate' if they have potentially come into contact with the infection. However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Study design: The study design is a rapid evidence review. Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. Results: We found 3163 articles and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.",

Particularly during the early stages of a novel infectious disease outbreak, quarantine can be applied to large numbers of people. For example, in Toronto during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, 100 people were placed into quarantine for every case that was diagnosed. 3 The early stages of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak have already witnessed the quarantining of entire cities within China, 4 whereas thousands of foreign nationals leaving China are being asked to enter quarantine at home or in government facilities upon return to their home countries.",

Although officially sanctioned enforcement of quarantine orders is possible, 7 this can lead to legal dispute, 5 chaotic scenes of confrontation 8 and poor mental health (which can occur even under voluntary procedures). 4, 9 Many nations are understandably nervous of these outcomes, especially given that confrontation can now result in harrowing mobile phone footage making its way to social and mainstream media. In many societies it might also be difficult to persuade the police or military to forcibly prevent healthy people who wish to leave quarantine from doing so. Seeking to avoid instances of public backlash, many countries rely instead on a combination of inducements and appeals to civic duty to encourage people to adhere.",

Whether parents' employers provided paid leave did not affect adherence to quarantine recommendations during the H1N1 outbreak among children who had been sent home from school. 11 However, where parents nonetheless took time off work to supervise their children, adherence to quarantine was higher, as the alternative might have involved others supervising children which would have broken quarantine protocol regarding social mixing. 11 Porten et al. 12 found that during the SARS outbreak, unemployed or low-waged people were more likely to adhere to quarantine. For students, however, having an additional job alongside being a student did not appear to be a relevant factor. 13 Being a healthcare worker was associated with higher adherence to quarantine during the SARS outbreak in Canada. 14 Within student populations, no differences were found in accordance with gender, age, full or part-time status, residing on or off campus or quarantine location. 13 Knowledge about the infectious disease outbreak and quarantine protocol One of the major factors affecting adherence to quarantine is knowledge about the infection and the quarantine protocol. When five schools in an Australian city were closed during the H1N1 pandemic, a lack of clear quarantine instructions led some of those affected to invent their own quarantine rules, 15 seemingly based on what they thought constituted a visible symptom of the disease, the acceptable degree of contact with those infected and the risk of being affected or of infecting others. Parents in an Australian city who understood what they were meant to do during the quarantine period for H1N1 had significantly higher adherence to quarantine. 16 Caleo et al. 17 found that people in Sierra Leone who were put under quarantine due to Ebola also had problems adhering to protocols because they did not understand what 'isolation' meant. Adherence to quarantine in Taiwan during the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with higher awareness of the pandemic. 18 However, in some cases, too much perceived knowledge might be a hindrance. Residents of villages that were quarantined during the Ebola epidemic who were health professionals often had more knowledge about Ebola than the volunteers sent in to support the village. They believed they knew more about the risk of infection than volunteers, but unlike the latter did not always adhere to the quarantine measures as they thought the restrictions were too overprecautionary. 19 One study looked at the effect of where people got their knowledge of quarantine protocols from, finding no difference in adherence rates between those that sourced information from official vs unofficial sources. 16 Sociocultural factors: social norms, cultural values and the law Social norms play an important part in adherence to quarantine protocols. Many individuals quarantined during the SARS outbreak in Canada reported social pressure from others to adhere to quarantine. 20 Desclaux et al. 19 noted that residents from villages in Senegal which quarantined during Ebola said that if there was favourable opinion for engaging in quarantine from the head of household, it was expected the rest of the household would follow suit and adhere. Residents also acknowledged a respect for the collective commitment to protect the community against Ebola which they did not want to be seen to be disrespecting.",

As rumours that others were breaking quarantine began to surface among Australian school communities quarantined during the H1N1 outbreak in Australia, those affected explained they were more likely to break quarantine protocols themselves. 15 Volunteers who were supporting villages in Senegal during quarantine for Ebola also mentioned 'relaxing their principles' and allowing nonadherence to quarantine at certain times to avoid direct challenges to containment which would then be seen by the rest of the village. 19 Cultural values also play an important part in decisions to adhere to quarantine. Residents of villages in West Africa quarantined during an Ebola outbreak often did not adhere to quarantine as it was inherent in their culture to care for people when they are sick, rather than 'abandon' them. 17 Conversely, two studies noted that participants quarantined during SARS explained that they adhered to quarantine as it was their 'civic duty' and they wanted to be a good citizen. 20, 21 Two studies noted that 'following the law' was a reason for adhering to quarantine during the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone 17 and the SARS outbreak in Canada. 20 In these circumstances, if individuals were found breaking quarantine rules, they faced paying fines. Relatedly, where the term 'voluntary' was used to describe quarantine in Canada during the SARS outbreak, residents correctly understood this meant that adherence was at their discretion, rather than enforced by the government, something which then reduced adherence. 21 ",

Relatedly, increased adherence to quarantine in Australia during the H1N1 pandemic occurred when there was an influenza case in the household, which again may be associated with increased perceived risk of disease transmission now that the disease is amongst family members, or an increase in knowledge of the disease and quarantine protocol. 23 One study looked at the effect of the objective severity of disease on adherence to quarantine, finding no effect of the total probable cases of SARS or number of quarantined people on likelihood of adherence. 18 ",

Key to this is making sure that information about the infectious disease outbreak and quarantine protocol is clear and consistent. Where information is unclear and open to interpretation, this can lead to people creating their own, possibly ineffective, rules. 15 In the era of 'fake news' and rumour, we appreciate consistent messaging is difficult, but it remains the case that leaving the information needs of the public unmet can be dangerous. Public health teams should regularly check with those under quarantine what they understand or are unclear on, and provide clear, authoritative information where needed. It is also important to reinforce social norms and moral values around quarantine. These are recognised determinants of behaviour. 27 Many participants included in our reviewed studies reported social pressure from others to comply, 20 not wanting to be seen going against the collective commitment to protect against the outbreak, 19 and feeling quarantine was their 'civic duty'. 20, 21 Emphasising the altruistic nature of engaging in quarantine may help promote these beliefs.",
