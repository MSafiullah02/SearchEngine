Campylobacterjejuni is pathogenic to humans and animals and is found throughout the world in most \\pecies of birds and mammals.

Campylobacteriosis is more common than salmonellosis as a cause of food poisoning in humans. There appear to be no discernible differences between the organisms causing human, canine and fcline enteritis.",

According to different studies, Campylobacter species may be isolated from benveen 20 and 30 per cent of diarrhoeic pet dogs and In colonies, however, up to IOO per cent of dogs may be asymptomatic excretors of Campylobacter. Thus, it is evident that a carrier state exists and, in addition, Campylobacter species may be found in diarrhoea as an opportunist infection (eg, secondary to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption, giardiasis, coronavirus and parvovirus infections). A positive isolation of C jejuni is, therefore, not necessarily diagnostic for campylobacteriosis.",
