            "text": "ACE and ACE2 are widely distributed in the human body; the former is mainly found in lung, kidney, heart, and blood vessel tissue, while the latter is more abundant in the digestive tract, lung, kidney, heart, and blood vessels. Strictly speaking, ACE2 is not an isozyme of ACE but a homologous enzyme [6]. It was initially thought that ACE2 was distributed only in the heart, kidney, and testis [7], but it has recently been found that ACE2 is also expressed in lung, liver, spleen, brain, intestine, placenta, heart and many other tissues, and its tissue distribution is organ specific; it is highly expressed in the kidney and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems, while its expression level is low in lung, the central nervous system and lymphoid tissue [8\u201310]. In the RAS, renin hydrolyzes angiotensin into angiotensin I (Ang I), which is subsequently converted by ACE to Ang II, and Ang II binds to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) on the vascular smooth muscle cell membrane, which causes a variety of effects, including vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. ACE2 could hydrolyze Ang I into inactive Ang1\u20139 and hydrolyze Ang II into Ang1\u20137. Ang1\u20137 could act on the Mas receptor to play a role in cardiovascular protection, including vasodilation, antiproliferation, and antioxidative stress. Therefore, this reveals that, in vivo, the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and the ACE2-Ang1\u20137-MAS axis function as checks and balances to maintain homeostasis.",

            "text": "In normal human lung tissues, ACE2 is expressed in type I and II alveolar epithelial cells [11, 12]. Some studies have analyzed the expression profiles of ACE2 RNA in normal human lung and showed that the expression of the viral receptor ACE2 is concentrated in a small number of type II alveolar (AT2) cells. More importantly, these AT2 cells not only express viral receptors but also express more than 20 other genes closely related to virus replication and transmission, which indicates that AT2 cells are likely to be the target cells of COVID-19. It was found that 0.64% of human lung cells expressed ACE2, and more than 80% of total ACE2 expression was found in AT2 cells by comparing data from 43134 single-cell RNA sequencing results from normal lung tissues from eight different racial/ethnic groups. Surprisingly, the proportion of ACE2-positive cells was 2.5% in the only Asian (male) specimen, which was much higher than that in the African and white (only 0.47%) specimens, which suggested that Asian populations might be more susceptible to COVID-19 [13]. In addition, the percentage of cells expressing ACE2 was higher in men than in women [13], but the sample size was smaller (just eight cases), and larger-scale sample data are needed to further confirm this conclusion. High expression of ACE2 in AT2 cells can explain the severe alveolar injury phenomenon observed after COVID-19 infection and provide a reference for the formulation of a new coronavirus pneumonia treatment strategy in the future.",

After further combined treatment with losartan and lisinopril, there was no significant change in ACE2 activity compared to that observed with treatment with losartan alone, and it offset the effect of losartan on increasing the expression of ACE2 mRNA. Therefore, there is a lack of correlation between the rise and fall of cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression and its activity. These results indicated that angiotensin might be involved in a more complex signal conduction mechanism by which an ACEI/angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) may regulate the gene expression and activity of ACE2 [14].",
