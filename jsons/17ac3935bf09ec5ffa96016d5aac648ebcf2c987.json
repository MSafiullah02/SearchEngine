The gene-compression theory claims that this feature is a strategy to maximize the information content of small genomes (Lamb and Horvath, 1991; Pavesi et al., 1997) , as a consequence of error-prone polymerases (Belshaw et al., 2007) and biophysical constraints acting on the capsid structure (Chirico et al., 2010) . The gene-novelty theory asserts that the birth of de novo proteins, often overprinting a structural or enzymatic protein, is driven by selection pressures providing the virus with a fitness advantage that lead to their fixation (Keese and Gibbs, 1992; Rancurel et al., 2009; Brandes and Linial, 2016) . Indeed, the de novo proteins originated by overprinting often play a critical role in virus infection, by neutralizing the host interferon response (van Knippenberg et al., 2010; Mc Fadden et al., 2011; Wensman et al., 2013) and the RNA interference pathway (Vargason et al., 2003; Chellappan et al., 2005; Li and Ding, 2006) , by inducing apoptosis in host cells (Noteborn et al., 1994; Chen et al., 2001 , Boehme et al., 2013 or promoting the systemic spread of virus (Taliansky et al., 2003) , A few de novo proteins can also exert functions that are not virus-specific. A well-known example is the apoptin of Chicken anemia virus, which induces cell death in a broad range of human tumour cell lines but not in normal cells (Danen-Van Oorschot et al., 1997; Backendorf et al., 2008 ; reviewed by Castro et al., 2018) . Another example is the X protein of Borna disease virus, which shows protective properties against neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo (Szelechowski et al., 2014) . To increase their therapeutic effectiveness, researchers have constructed N-terminal deleted forms or short peptides both for apoptin (Shen Ni et al., 2013; Ruiz-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) and X protein (Szelechowski et al., 2014; Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 266, "text": "(Lamb and Horvath, 1991;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 267, "end": 287, "text": "Pavesi et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 334, "end": 356, "text": "(Belshaw et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 416, "end": 438, "text": "(Chirico et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 669, "end": 692, "text": "(Keese and Gibbs, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 693, "end": 715, "text": "Rancurel et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 716, "end": 741, "text": "Brandes and Linial, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 892, "end": 922, "text": "(van Knippenberg et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 923, "end": 946, "text": "Mc Fadden et al., 2011;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 947, "end": 968, "text": "Wensman et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1025, "text": "(Vargason et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1050, "text": "Chellappan et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1069, "text": "Li and Ding, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1131, "text": "(Noteborn et al., 1994;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1149, "text": "Chen et al., 2001", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1171, "text": ", Boehme et al., 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1238, "text": "(Taliansky et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1505, "text": "(Danen-Van Oorschot et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1529, "text": "Backendorf et al., 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1564, "text": "Castro et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1732, "text": "(Szelechowski et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1869, "end": 1891, "text": "(Shen Ni et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1919, "text": "Ruiz-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1920, "end": 1939, "text": "Zhang et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1954, "end": 1981, "text": "(Szelechowski et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 2001, "text": "Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2017)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "To identify viral overlapping genes by sequence analysis, Firth (2014) and Sealfon et al.

They show a common, and peculiar, pattern of nucleotide and amino acid composition. Thanks to discriminant analysis, overlapping genes can be separated from non-overlapping genes with high accuracy. Thus, the model I developed is a valuable tool for identifying new potential dual-coding regions in the viral genome sequences deposited in databases and, possibly, also in the eukaryotic genome sequences. A preliminary application of the model to SARS-CoV-2 led to prediction of 2 putative overlaps in the 3' genome region. The finding that the proteins encoded by the de novo frames differ significantly from those encoded by the ancestral frames supports the view that overprinting is a valuable source of genetic novelties. This view is corroborated by the notion that 2 de novo proteins (apoptin from CAV and X protein from BDV) can exert functions that are not virus-specific, such as a selective anticancer toxicity in human tumour cell lines and a protection against neurodegeneration in tissue culture, respectively. The search for variants of these proteins with an enhanced therapeutic effectiveness is an intriguing field of research. The contribution provided by this study could be helpful for future experimental studies.

Over a total of 150,000 rounds of permutation, the algorithm selected a total of 30,571 new overlaps with a +1 frame not interrupted by stop codons and meeting the following criteria: i) a PLS-DA score from -0.96 to -0.76; ii) a first LDA.1 score from -42.0 to -40.2; iii) a LDA.2 score from 8.3 to 15.0. This high amount of new overlaps was notably reduced using a conservation criterion. Leaving out the 2 apoptosis-inducing domains, the multiple alignment of the apoptins from CAV, AGV2, and Gyrovirus Tu789 revealed conservation of 14 amino acids. Using as filter the presence of these amino acids, I obtained a set of 1111 apoptin variants with a mean amino acid identity of 87.5% (sd = 2.3%).

By this approach, the number of new overlaps was reduced to 1277 cases.
