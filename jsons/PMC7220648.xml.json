Distant-first recurrence was very rare in the SLNB-negative population (pathologic stage I/II), occurring in only one patient, but developed in 56% of patients with stage III MCC who subsequently relapsed. Furthermore, on baseline imaging, only 2% of patients had isolated distant disease without regional nodal involvement, and a minority (13%) of all study patients had distant disease spread as the first metastatic event. These findings suggest that regional LN metastasis likely precedes distant metastasis in a majority of patients. Lymphovascular invasion may be an early occurrence in MCC, present in 90% of primary tumor samples in one study, while isolated blood vascular invasion is much less common in only 3%.31 By identifying regional nodal metastases early, appropriate treatments could be offered in a timely manner to perhaps prevent distant disease relapse.10,19",

Preliminary subgroup analyses of disease recurrence patterns among patients who were pathologically staged were presented here and will be further validated in a multicenter study. Additionally, patients received variable treatments, the heterogeneity of which may not be fully accounted for in the analyses of recurrence and survival outcomes.
