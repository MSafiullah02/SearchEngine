Approximately 70 pathogens have emerged between 1967 and 2009, and the majority of these microorganisms made the \u201cjump\u201d from their zoonotic host into the human species. Infectious disease surveillance has evolved dramatically during the last few years as part of the \u201cmolecular revolution\u201d in life sciences. Infectious disease surveillance systems are generally divided into three categories: (1) laboratory-initiated infectious disease notification; (2) syndromic surveillance systems; and (3) genotyping-based surveillance of biothreats.12 In any of these three complementary systems, the clinical laboratory plays a critical role.",

Sensitivity and specificity range widely depending on the disease/syndrome and the threshold for triggering the alarm.16 When syndromic surveillance is used in conjunction with laboratory-initiated surveillance, the low specificity and high sensitivity of syndromic surveillance are potentially compensated by the higher specificity of the laboratory-initiated surveillance system.12\n",

In addition, powerful biosensors using molecular approaches have monitored selected environments to detect potential pathogens before onset of symptoms in exposed persons (BioWatch and Biological Aerosol Sentry and Information System,12, 17 and the Autonomous Pathogen Detection System).17, 18 The current challenge is to integrate all surveillance systems into a system that provides comprehensive information and timely alerts. The vast electronic data collected by syndromic and genomic surveillance require new technologies for data storing, mining, and temporal/spatial analysis of outbreaks. The ultimate goal is the creation of \u201cglobal laboratories\u201d or global real-time epidemiological surveillance in which all surveillance information is processed along with geographic information systems and a real-time output is rendered regarding infectious threats around the world.12 Attempts to achieve this goal are represented by the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the International System for Total Early Disease Detection (InStedd).",

However, many patients also developed hematogenous hemorrhagic pneumonia. Pleural effusions were usually large and frequently led to severe lung atelectasis. In about half of cases, hemorrhagic meningitis led rapidly to central nervous system (CNS) manifestations terminating in coma and death.22, 34, 35\n",

The WHO declared smallpox eradicated in 1980 after the last case of natural disease was diagnosed in Somalia in 1977,48 and vaccination ceased around the world, rendering humankind vulnerable to reintroduction of the virus.49, 50, 51 A laboratory accident was responsible for two more cases in 1978 in England. This accident prompted the WHO to restrict the frozen virus to two places: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia and the Institute for Polyomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides in Moscow, later moved to NPO VECTOR, Novosibirisk. However, it is suspected that secret military repositories exist after the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and the subsequent exodus of scientists involved in its bioweapons program (Biopreparat).52, 53 The agent responsible for this disease is an orthopox virus with no known animal reservoir, but high aerosol infectivity, stability, and mortality. Although not a category A agent, monkeypox is responsible for outbreaks in Africa and is the only other member of the Orthopoxvirus genus capable of producing systemic disease in humans. Monkeypox is potentially indistinguishable from smallpox, where mortality rates in tropical Central Africa are around 10\u201315%. In May and June 2003, an outbreak of monkeypox occurred in the United States.54 Thirty-seven infections were laboratory-documented and involved humans exposed to infected prairie dogs which had become infected because of contact with infected Gambian rats and dormice shipped from Africa earlier that year. Cases included veterinarians, exotic pet dealers, and pet owners. The clinical spectrum in this outbreak ranged from asymptomatic seroconversions to febrile illness with papulovesicular rash, but no deaths. However, phylogenetic analysis of the virus placed it in the less virulent West Africa clade rather than the Central Africa clade, which carries a case-fatality rate of 10\u201315%.",

In 1972, Yugoslavia underwent an epidemic with a total of 175 cases (35 deaths) and a vaccination program that included 20 million people in order to contain the outbreak and obtain international confidence. Vaccination with vaccinia virus (a related orthopox virus) is the most effective way to prevent the disease and can be administered up to 4 days after contact with ill patients. Strict quarantine with respiratory isolation is also mandatory for 17 days. The newer generation of antivirals developed after the disease was eradicated has never been tested in human populations, but in vitro data and experiments in animal models of poxvirus disease suggest some antiviral activity for the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates such as cidofovir.55 The only vaccine available in the United States is Dryvax, and sufficient doses have been manufactured to cover the entire US population. However, newer vaccines which may have fewer side effects are being developed.",

The typical smallpox rash has a centrifugal distribution (more abundant on the face and extremities than on the trunk and abdomen). An enanthem also develops with presence of oral ulcerations by the time the exanthem appears. Systemic manifestations begin to subside once the rash appears and can reappear with superinfection of skin lesions or superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. Progression of the lesions is synchronous (maculopapules, vesicles, pustules). After pustules rupture, scabs form and detach in 2\u20133 weeks, leaving depigmented, scarred areas.

Both low target number multiplexing (3\u20136) and highly multiplexed assays (>10 targets) have been developed. The Luminex xTag RVP assay is capable of detecting 16 targets using universal bead array sorting technology. The use of microchips and microarrays containing several thousands of oligonucleotides from all viruses known to be pathogenic to humans is an encouraging development. In fact, the rapid identification and characterization of the novel human coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 are excellent examples of the power of hybridization-based microchips.

Laboratory diagnosis is based on isolation of the microorganism from blood, bone marrow, or other tissue samples. Isolation is not easy due to the slow growth of Brucella spp. Colonies usually appear after 4\u20136 weeks, and therefore communication with the clinical laboratory is important so that appropriate media will be used and the cultures will be held long enough for colonies to be detected.96 Serologic assays for demonstration of rising antibody titers are retrospective. PCR detection is promising, but is not standardized.146, 147, 148\n",

If weaponized toxin is used in the absence of C. botulinum organisms, detection of the genetic material would be difficult and would rely on the presence of residual DNA after toxin purification procedures. If inhalational botulism is suspected, respiratory secretions and nasal swabs should be obtained as early as possible.

The nonspecific nature of presenting symptoms is a major problem for several agents. An early diagnosis of the epidemic must be established, particularly for organisms such as Y. pestis in which there is only a short window for successful treatment. An example is the automated biological agent testing system (ABATS), that combines the above techniques.92 The system integrates several commercially available technologies into one single automated, robotized instrument for detection of viruses, bacteria, and parasites considered potential BT agents. The technologies incorporated into this \u201csuper system\u201d include automated specimen preparation (both nucleic acid-based and protein-based, such as immunodiagnostics), thermocyclers for PCR detection, electrochemiluminescence detectors for immunobased assays, sequencers, and software programs for sequence analysis. Another powerful system is the Ibis T5000 Universal BW sensor based on broad-range PCR and high-performance mass spectrometry.153, 154 This system is based on technology developed for the Department of Defense and known as TIGER (triangulation identification for the genetic evaluation of risks). Mass spectrometry of amplified products derives the identity of the agent based on the composition of amplicons. This technology has been used successfully to amplify nucleic acids of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoans. Several pairs of broad-range primers are used in a multiplex format, and amplified products are analyzed by mass spectrometry followed by species/strain identification using sophisticated software systems. Liquid-based microassay bead systems (Luminex) are also providing an outstanding platform for development of multiplex detection systems.",
