            "text": "The field of intestinal transplantation has developed significantly since the first reports involving dogs in the late 1950s [1]. Although small series demonstrated some short-term success of intestinal transplantation in the 1960s [1, 2], long-term success was not reported until tacrolimus was introduced into clinical transplantation in 1990. Subsequently, dramatic and rapid progress in donor and recipient selection processes, evolution of surgical techniques, and enhancements in early perioperative care led to a significant improvement in early postoperative patient and graft survival in this challenging population. Key lessons were learned from the early failures in intestinal transplantation, as most graft loss was attributable to overwhelming rejection due to the inability to provide effective immunosuppression to this complex population in the face of such a lymphoid-rich, bacteria-containing graft [1]. Additional causes of early graft loss included ischemic injury of the allograft resulting in poor reperfusion and technical complications. Each of these early factors can be associated with infections occurring after transplant in association with severely damaged allografts rich in pathogens within the intestinal lumen [2]. Finally, morbidity and mortality were also encountered as a result of the mobilization and engraftment of donor-derived lymphocytes leading to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [3].",

As a consequence, intestinal transplants are now performed worldwide with good overall results and long-term survival. Unfortunately, the high levels of long-term immunosuppression necessary to prevent and treat cellular and humoral rejection in ITx recipients have been an important contributor in the majority of deaths following intestinal transplant which have been directly related to infection and malignancy. Indeed, the future success of intestinal transplant relies on balancing the risks of immunologic complications associated with under-immunosuppression and the often fatal consequences of over-immunosuppression.",

PN has changed the outcome for patients who have intestinal failure by effectively providing temporizing benefits parallel to those seen with hemodialysis in patients with kidney failure. However, long-term survivors of PN can experience morbidity associated with development of catheter sepsis, venous thrombosis-induced loss of vascular access, and PN-induced cholestatic liver disease. Liver disease and the secondarily dilated short gut seen with intestinal adaptation facilitate intestinal bacterial overgrowth, enteritis, bacterial translocation, the seeding of venous catheters, and line sepsis. Severe bloodstream infections can result in metastatic infectious foci, endocarditis, multisystem organ failure, and death. In addition, the infectious complications of IF may contribute to the development and progression of parenteral nutrition-dependent liver injury [4].",

            "text": "A numberof different variations of intestinal transplantation can be carried out to ideally suit the anatomic and functional needs of the recipient; the etiology for intestinal failure dictates the type of intestinal allograft used. The need for associated stomach, pancreas, or colon in addition to the small bowel allograft is determined on the basis of the functional or vascular disease of those organs in the recipient. The diagnosis of end-stage liver disease as a consequence of TPN will determine the need for liver replacement. Consequently, intestinal transplantation procedures may provide the isolated intestine, the combined liver and intestine (with or without the pancreas), complete multivisceral intestinal allografts which include the entire gastrointestinal tract (i.e., stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and small bowel) along with the liver, and modified multivisceral grafts, which include the entire gastrointestinal tract (i.e., stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and small bowel) and exclude the liver [4]. Patient and graft survivals during the early posttransplant period vary according to the transplantation procedure. The best early survivals are associated with the isolated intestinal transplant, and the worst outcomes are observed in recipients of multivisceral allografts. The reason for this stems from the fact that recipients of isolated intestine allografts are relatively stable, when compared to patients with TPN-induced liver failure (portal hypertension, pancytopenia, coagulopathy) who will also require the larger composite grafts (liver/intestine or multivisceral grafts). The morbidity and mortality associated with outcomes after multivisceral transplantation stem from the difficulty of the resection portion of the operation and of the immediate posttransplant management. The risk of infection inherently determines short-term and long-term survivability.",

More commonly, rejection episodes tend to be mild to moderate, without such infectious consequences; however, acute rejection should be considered as a potential etiology of any bacteremia with enteric organisms. The overall incidence of rejection of the intestinal allograft has been high (greater than 85 %), with the average patient experiencing between one and five episodes of rejection per graft [6, 12, 15]; more recent progress in immunosuppression management has introduced the ability to minimize immunosuppressive load, thereby resulting in less rejection and consequently less infection. This high frequency of rejection of varying severities likely accounts for the high frequency of bloodstream infections seen in intestinal transplant recipients. The clinical signs of rejection include abdominal pain, distention, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fever; however, these can also suggest the presence of a concomitant bacterial or fungal infection. The diagnosis of rejection is based on the findings from endoscopic biopsies of the intestinal allograft mucosa. Such confirmation is critical, particularly in long-term patients who present with minimal symptoms, and fever as opportunistic infections, such as CMV and EBV, can produce similar symptoms. In addition, episodes of enteritis secondary to infections with EBV and CMV may also be accompanied by damage to the mucosal barrier and associated bloodstream infections with bacteria and fungi.",

Furthermore, indwelling intravenous catheters may be required for up to a year or longer after transplantation, placing these recipients at a higher risk of bacteremia. The high risk of CMV and EBV diseases carries a proportionately higher morbidity and mortality as well. The baseline immunosuppression levels\u2014higher than those for other solid organs\u2014that are required for a long term to maintain the intestinal allograft place these patients at a higher risk for symptomatic disease from these pathogens. Children may also be serologically naive for CMV and EBV, thus increasing the already high risk for disease. The chronic, higher level of immunosuppression required by these patients also raises the risk for severe infections from community-acquired pathogens (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenovirus, streptococcal pneumonia, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). However, despite high baseline immunosuppression, most intestinal transplant recipients who develop these infections tolerate them quite well because of their improved overall health status.\n",

In addition, the relationship between patient and graft survival is inherently dependent on the reversibility of the type of transplant performed. For example, if a patient who has undergone an isolated intestinal transplant develops a life-threatening complication of the intestine or immunosuppression (e.g., uncontrollable rejection or posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder [PTLD]), the intestinal allograft can be safely removed and the immunosuppression discontinued. Unfortunately, patients who have undergone combined liver and intestinal transplants have a much poorer outcome after the removal of the intestine and discontinuation of immunosuppression with the rapid development of allograft liver disease and death. Until recently, this was responsible for a progressively declining survival curve up until 3\u20134 years, at which time it plateaus (Figure 15-1). This curve contrasts with that of recipients of liver or kidney allografts in whom, after the first posttransplantation year, the baseline levels of immunosuppression are lowered, with a declining risk of rejection or infectious complications in the later posttransplant years. This resulted in a higher rate of survival at all posttransplant times.\n",

The treatment for suspected bacteremia should take into account the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial pathogens associated with prior episodes of infection both before and after transplantation. Changes to the immunosuppressive drug strategy inherently parallel the treatment of any infection in patients after ITx.

Because ganciclovir prophylaxis had been ineffective in preventing the disease in children and adults in the 1990s, several centers would avoid CMV-seropositive donor organs in CMV-negative candidates awaiting isolated intestinal transplantation. This policy did not generally apply to patients waiting for combined liver and intestine transplants; due to the excessive mortality risk, end-stage liver disease places these patients at a higher risk of dying while waiting for organ allografts. However, the availability and effectiveness of prophylactic strategies, as well as changing patterns of CMV disease potentially associated with the use of induction immunosuppressive therapies, may affect the prevalence and outcome of CMV disease. Indeed, most recent studies have confirmed almost nonexistent mortality from CMV disease, even in high-risk patient populations [16, 33].",

Historically, the diagnosis of EBV infections and of PTLD is typically in the first year after transplant, with the average time from transplant to the diagnosis of PTLD in pediatric ITx recipients being 9 months [52, 53]. However, later cases do occur and PTLD is diagnosed after the first year in roughly 30 % of cases [52, 53]. Prior to monitoring protocols, EBV disease was frequently found with endoscopy or a computed tomography after nonspecific abdominal findings or peripheral lymphadenopathy in an ill patient [12]. The pattern of EBV disease in intestinal transplant recipients is similar to patterns historically seen with other solid organs, in which a nonspecific viral syndrome may eventually progress to PTLD. It can present clinically as a febrile syndrome, nonspecific lymphadenopathy mimicking mononucleosis, PTLD, or lymphoma. Similar to CMV, the most frequent site of involvement is the intestinal allograft; however, the native gastrointestinal tract is also frequently involved. The classic presentation is lymphadenopathy (although this may be limited to intra-abdominal location), blood in the stools, and an endoscopic finding of nodular ulcerated tumors in the intestinal allograft or the native gastrointestinal tract (Figure 15-2).\n",

In 1994, the authors began monitoring the EBV viral load in the peripheral blood using a quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (QC/PCR) assay. This monitoring was coupled with a preemptive therapy (PT) strategy in an effort to diagnose early EBV infection rather than after established disease or PTLD is present. This strategy included the use of ganciclovir and intravenous immune globulin and the judicious weaning of immunosuppression. The management of EBV disease and PTLD in intestinal transplant recipients is more complex than that with liver transplant recipients, because significant decreases or withdrawal of immunosuppression, which are the mainstay for management in other solid organ recipients, can result in severe breakthrough intestinal allograft rejection. This strategy is even more challenging as ITx recipients can present with evidence of concomitant EBV disease and rejection. Thus, the morbidity and mortality in the setting of PTLD can stem from the lymphoproliferative process, concomitant infections with CMV and bacterial pathogens, and/or severe intestinal allograft rejection [52, 53].",

At our institution, this therapy is instituted for elevated and/or rapidly rising viral loads. The exact level of EBV load to initiate PT will vary according to which assay is used to measure the load. In addition, we have typically initiated PT at very low loads for EBV-seronegative recipients experiencing primary infection while we have used cutoffs close to levels where EBV disease and PTLD are observed for those who are EBV seropositive prior to transplant. Although the effectiveness of each of the individual components of this strategy remain unproven, the combined use of this approach along with evolutions in immunosuppression algorithms for these patients has resulted in decreases in the incidence, morbidity, and mortality attributable to EBV disease and PTLD in this population [53].",

With intestinal transplant recipients, such manipulations of immunosuppressive drugs have resulted in high rejection rates, complicating the management of EBV disease and PTLD. More recent immunosuppressive management strategies using antilymphocyte globulin induction and tacrolimus at low levels (10 ng/mL) and no steroids have allowed for significant improvement in the incidence and severity of rejection and also the ability to minimize immunosuppression in a similar fashion as with other organs. This has resulted in improved survival and also in a significantly lower rate of CMV and EBV/PTLD [12] (Figure 15-4). The majority of patients will demonstrate some evidence of a clinical response within 2\u20134 weeks after modulation of medications. The impact of EBV viral load monitoring on the incidence and outcome of EBV disease and PTLD cannot be overemphasized. Rates of EBV disease and PTLD using this approach have dropped dramatically when compared to a cohort of children undergoing intestinal transplantation at the authors\u2019 institution prior to the availability of this approach [54]. Therefore, early diagnosis does affect the outcome of EBV disease, and judicious reductions of immunosuppression in this setting allow resolution with a lower incidence or absence of rejection of the intestinal allograft.\n",

During this early experience, the results of treatment of lymphoproliferative disorder were further limited by the fact that 30 % of the surviving patients experienced chronic and/or recurrent episodes of EBV disease after successful therapy [52]. This contrasts sharply to the recurrence rate of 5\u201310 % seen with other solid organ transplants. This likely results from the ongoing need of the intestinal transplant recipient to continue with high baseline levels of immunosuppressive therapy, which limits the body\u2019s ability to generate a cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte response against EBV. Of note, evolutions in the management of ITx recipients, including evolving immunosuppression strategies and the use of EBV load monitoring, have resulted in a marked improvement in the outcome of PTLD [51]. Unfortunately, this will not be adequate treatment in some PTLD lesions that are no longer under control of EBV and behave more like true malignancies [50]. The authors recommend a trial of immunosuppression reduction unless there is concurrent rejection or histologic evidence of true malignancy. In addition to IS reduction, antiviral and immunomodulating medications can be used as potential therapy, with failure leading to the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy.",

Studies have demonstrated variable success in using rituximab in treatment of PTLD that has not responded to IS reduction. Studies in children have shown good short-term response rates of 80 %, though there is a significant recurrence rate of 25 % [58]. Rituximab has become a key component of treatment of CD20-positive PTLD in some intestinal recipients, especially those with concurrent rejection or those not responding to the combination of immunosuppression reduction and antiviral/immunoglobulin therapy. Vigilant posttreatment follow-up is required as recurrence is possible and occurred in roughly 20 % of responders in one large French study, at a median of 7 months after treatment. In addition, a significant percentage of patients will develop hypogammaglobulinemia and should be appropriately treated [58]. Additionally, encouraging results have been obtained using a combination of low-dose chemotherapy and rituximab in the treatment of PTLD in setting of solid organ transplant. Studies have shown 2-year relapse-free survival rates of 70 % [59]. While the use of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) to treat EBV-related PTLD (which has shown to be effective in bone marrow recipients) is of interest, experience to date has not been able to demonstrate definitive success in SOT recipients. As an alternative approach, Haque and colleagues have developed a bank of 100 EBV-specific CTLs, using healthy blood donors in the UK. Using this bank, the authors used HLA \u201cbest fit\u201d CTLs in a phase II multicenter trial to treat PTLD that was refractory to other methods with 52 % overall response rate. Of those patients that had a response, an impressive 82 % were complete [60] with documented long-term survival in responders [61]. Finally, transplant physicians should also recognize the importance of allograft enterectomy to allow for complete withdrawal of immunosuppression in cases where such an approach can be taken (isolated intestinal transplant), especially for those not responding to first- or second-line therapies.",

            "text": "In a recent retrospective review of 25 children who had undergone intestinal and/or liver transplant, the Miami group reported a high rate of rhinovirus as an etiology of LRTRVI. Although the overall mortality associated with LRTRVI was from 13 %, no children with rhinovirus succumbed to the disease. Interestingly, RSV infection was associated with a 40 % mortality, and was the direct cause of death, despite reduction in immunosuppression and administration of palivizumab [63]. Due to the potential morbidity and mortality associated with RSV LRTRVI [64], some experts recommend immunoprophylaxis with an RSV-specific monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) for children less than 1 year of age who are transplanted or are receiving anti-lymphocyte treatment during RSV season. Treatment of RSV is limited, though careful reduction in baseline immunosuppression should be considered if clinically warranted. Aerosolized ribavirin is currently approved for the treatment of severe RSV LRTRVI and is generally used in combination with palivizumab, though data supporting this are limited. Intravenous ribavirin has also been used for treatment; the benefit of this agent must be weighed against the potential for the development of complication, specifically hemolytic anemia [65]. An in-depth discussion of other respiratory viruses (influenza, parainfluenza, and coronaviruses), their treatment, and prevention with vaccination strategies before and after transplantation can be found elsewhere (Chaps. 10.1007/978-3-319-28797-3_30 and 10.1007/978-3-319-28797-3_32). However the authors would stress the importance of avoidance of infection with well-thought-out policies regarding timing of vaccination and/or immunoprophylaxis in this challenging population.",

Based on older studies done prior to the routine use of prophylaxis, up to 15 % of organ transplant recipients experienced an infection with Pneumocystis. The clinical course of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is generally one of dyspnea and hypoxia out of proportion to physical and radiographic findings. Rapid diagnosis is important and although PCP can be suggested by the presence of diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs and CT scans, diagnosis requires confirmation by direct detection of the organism in secretions. Direct staining of secretions from either induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage can be accomplished with immunoflourescent antibody stains and direct staining with Giemsa, Wright, and Gomori methenamine silver preparations. Treatment is with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. Inhaled pentamidine has also been utilized and adjuvant corticosteroids may improve oxygenation in cases associated with significant hypoxia. Long-term prophylaxis in all intestinal patients is recommended. The ideal agent for prophylaxis is TMP\u2013SMX, which is generally well tolerated and provides excellent prophylaxis against toxoplasmosis and Nocardia, both potentially fatal opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients [66\u201368].",

Significant osmotic diarrhea in a patient with an intestinal allograft is rejection until proven otherwise. Fever is as likely to be a manifestation of intestinal rejection as infection and cannot be used to differentiate the two and the treatment of intestinal rejection, augmentation of immunosuppression, is the polar opposite of that for infectious diarrhea. Inappropriate use of immunosuppression to empirically treat rejection in a transplant patient can, and has been, a fatal mistake. Conversely, delayed treatment of severe rejection due to a suspected infectious cause can lead to exfoliative rejection and graft loss. Unfortunately, gross inspection of the allograft is nonspecific and requires histologic inspection to adequately differentiate between severe allograft enteritis and rejection. In addition, the ability to make the diagnosis is further confounded by the possibility that the two processes can occur simultaneously or that rejection can rapidly follow an episode of infectious enteritis, making serial endoscopic investigations necessary. In the end, the differentiation between infection and rejection relies on the balance of clinical suspicion, presentation, and direct inspection of the allograft. Rapid processing and rapid availability of biopsy samples is required to aid in the timely differentiation between the two entities.",

Adenoviral enteritis was found in an additional 20 % of cases [70]. Interestingly, the most discussed agents, CMV and EBV, were not frequent causes of diarrhea in intestinal recipients. Clostridium difficile is another common cause of infectious diarrhea after SOT (including intestinal transplant recipients) with a prevalence of 2.7 % in a recent report of patients undergoing SOT [71]. Although specific reports describing the course of CDI in intestinal transplant recipients are lacking, however it was found to be the etiology of diarrhea in 15 % of these patients and responded to standard antibiotic therapy [70]. Recurrent CDI has been shown to be associated with risk factors such as increased LOS, prolonged antibiotic courses, high levels of immunosuppression, and other comorbid conditions [71]. Parasitic enteritis is also seen n ITx recipients. Infection due to Cryptosporidium sp. has been reported in intestinal recipients [70] as has infection due to Giardia lamblia [70]. Recent attention has begun to focus on norovirus as a cause of enteritis in SOT recipients. Despite its self-limited course in the general population, norovirus has been demonstrated to be the cause of prolonged diarrhea with severe dehydration in pediatric intestinal transplant recipients and infection is associated with a prolonged viral shedding [72]. Diagnosis can be difficult, as intestinal epithelial apoptosis is a common finding in human calicivirus enteritis, making differentiation for rejection difficult. If clinically suspected, however the diagnosis can be confirmed with PCR analysis of biopsy specimens or effluent [73].",
