            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) comprises acute-onset respiratory failure, which is characterized by hypoxemia and radiographic bilateral lung opacities that result from various direct or indirect injuries to the pulmonary parenchyma or vasculature [1]. The most recent Berlin definition provides common risk factors for ARDS, which are classified as direct factors (e.g., pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents) or indirect factors (e.g., non-pulmonary sepsis, major trauma, pancreatitis) [2]. Some patients presenting with ARDS, however, lack exposure to common risk factors, resulting in the condition called an ARDS \u201cimitator\u201d or \u201cmimic\u201d [3, 4]. In a large cohort study, Gibelin et al. reported a 7.5% prevalence of ARDS without a common risk factor [5]. A secondary analysis of the LUNG SAFE study confirmed that 8.3% of ARDS patients had no common risk factors that were identified when ARDS was recognized [6].",

Connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) is considered to be a main cause of immune-related forms of ARDS. CTD-ILD may precede the clinical and laboratory manifestations of CTD and therefore could present as lone ARDS [8]. Acute onset or acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial lung diseases may refer to idiopathic forms of ARDS. Although no risk factors or causes are identified in this subgroup of ARDS, recent studies have shown that many patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia have clinical features that suggest an underlying immune process, indicating that the pathobiology of idiopathic and immune-related diseases may partially overlap [9, 10]. Early identification of these subsets of ARDS based on the pathophysiology is of clinical interest and may lead to the development of specific therapeutic intervention. However, the lesions of these idiopathic and immune-related ARDS may be mostly limited to the lung, and it is often difficult in the acute phase to distinguish between idiopathic/immune-related diseases and ARDS with common direct risk factors, based solely on the clinical findings.",

The biomarkers may reflect activation and injuries of different cell populations in the lung and thereby help to improve the understanding about pathogenic processes and to improve diagnostics. Thrombin\u2013antithrombin complex (TAT) levels are increased in ARDS patients, reflecting tissue factor- and contact phase-mediated activation of coagulation cascade and excessive thrombin generation. Thrombin and proinflammatory cytokines activate endothelial cells, leading to expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, which inhibits fibrinolysis. The levels of natural anticoagulants such as protein C (PC) are reduced because of increased consumption, impaired synthesis, and mostly capillary leakage that results from endothelial damage. Surfactant protein (SP)-D and a membrane glycoprotein KL-6 are also increased in the plasma of ARDS patients, reflecting type II alveolar cell injury [13, 14]. The alterations in biomarkers that indicate thrombin generation, inhibited fibrinolysis, decreased anticoagulant, and epithelial injury are distinctive patterns of ARDS. However, whether these biomarker profiles may differ depending on the ARDS etiologies has not been examined.\n",

Additionally, no cardiac failure or fluid overload and no common indirect risk factors for ARDS, such as non-pulmonary sepsis, major trauma, or pancreatitis could be found [2]. Direct lung injury risk factors were defined as pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, pulmonary contusion, inhalation injury, and near drowning, based on the Berlin definitions. Patients with vasculitis were classified as having ARDS without common risk factors because vasculitis is not pathologically characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The diagnosis of pneumonia was based on Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines combined with clinical data and microbiological diagnostic testing (including a blood culture, sputum culture, or culture of endotracheal aspirate, and a urinary antigen test for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila) [15, 16]. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for Gram staining and culture, direct fluorescence assay for Pneumocystis jirovecii, and a rapid influenza A/B diagnostic test (immunochromatographic assays for specific influenza viral antigens) were also performed, as needed.",

A large validation study is needed to confirm our results.

Although we ruled out the common ARDS risk factors and known causes of interstitial pneumonia (e.g., drugs, environmental agents, CTDs) to diagnose idiopathic ARDS, we could not completely exclude the possibility of viral infections or environmental antigen exposures, which could subside spontaneously. Third, we could perform BAL for only about half of iARDS patients, which may not be generalizable to the whole population. Finally, we did not measure the biomarkers in the BAL fluid. Although systemic markers are easier to obtain and the BAL procedure may not always be possible because of the risk of respiratory and hemodynamic complications, the biomarkers in the BAL fluid would more specifically reflect the regional pathophysiology in the alveoli. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pathogenic processes of these biomarkers from the pulmonary compartment to the circulation.",
