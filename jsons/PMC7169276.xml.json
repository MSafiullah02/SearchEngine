The main secretory substance of the mammalian Harderian gland is lipid.4, 5 The Harderian gland has various functions including lubrication of the ocular surface and third eyelid, a site of immune response, a photoreceptive organ, a source of pheromones, thermoregulation, and a source of growth factors.4, 5\n",

Both lobes are divided by a thin band of connective tissue and converge into a single excretory duct which opens into the lower posterior part of the third eyelid near the conjunctival sac.5, 11, 12 The pink lobe consists of cuboidal cells and contains large lipid vacuoles, producing more lipids than the white lobe. The white lobe cells are columnar with smaller vacuoles.12, 13, 14, 15\n",

The others are the lacrimal, intraorbital, and superficial gland of the third eyelid.22 The exact proportion of tear production by each gland has not been reported. The Harderian gland in the rabbit produces lipids, especially in the pink lobe.4, 5, 11, 14 Due to this lipid production, the Harderian gland is difficult to visualize ultrasonographically and to differentiate it from retrobulbar fat. Knowledge of its special anatomy and size allows ultrasonographic imaging of the Harderian gland. The gland appears hypoechoic in the rabbit with the pink lobe slightly more hypoechoic than the white lobe. The echogenicity of fat depends on the number of fat\u2010filled vacuoles in an area as well as their size. This phenomenon has been described with hypoechoic foci in hepatic lipidosis.23 The larger the fat vacuoles, the more hypoechoic the area appears due to fewer tissue interfaces. This would also explain, why the pink lobe with larger vacuoles is more hypoechoic than the white lobe.12, 13, 14 The white lobe has a higher content of lipid droplets which gives it its white color.24\n",

Differences in measurement values may be attributed in part to variation in age among rabbits of the study reported here. Additionally, morphological and biochemical property variations of Harderian glands exist and are influenced by endogenous factors (e.g., hormones) and exogenous factors (e.g., temperature, photoreception, and thermoregulation).5, 13 The discrepancy in length may also be due to the fact that the gland has rounded margins and wraps around the medial and ventral portion of the eyeball.",

Other pathologic processes included steatitis and purulent necrosis of the retrobulbar fatty tissue. In rats, inflammation of the lacrimal and salivary glands (sialodacryoadenitis) is associated with hypertrophy of the Harderian gland and is caused by a rat coronavirus.25 In the rabbit, primary inflammatory disease of the Harderian gland is not reported, but it appears to undergo a similar pathogenesis secondary to retrobulbar inflammation. One rabbit had lymphoma of the Harderian gland previously described.21 Tumors of the Harderian gland have been described in mice, with cystadenomas and adenocarcinomas occurring most frequently.26 Exophthalmos associated with a cranial mediastinal mass or thymoma is commonly bilateral. This is believed to be a paraneoplastic syndrome and occurs when venous drainage by the jugular veins is obstructed.22, 27, 28 In this study, two rabbits with thymoma and bilateral exophthalmos were found. There was retrobulbar edema, and all four Harderian glands were enlarged and appeared more hyperechoic.",

Another hypothesis may be that the excretory and secretory ducts of the Harderian gland are filled with inflammatory cell infiltrates, causing obstruction. Obstruction of the Harderian gland excretory duct may also be caused by exophthalmos. The single excretory duct of the Harderian gland in the rabbit opens into the lower posterior part of the third eyelid near the conjunctival sac.5, 11, 12 When exophthalmos occurs from a retrobulbar lesion, the eyeball protrudes and applies pressure on the third eyelid, thereby obstructing the opening of the Harderian excretory duct.",

When comparing measurements of the diseased Harderian gland with the contralateral healthy side, significant changes in size were seen only in the vertical plane of the gland.

This suggests that the portion observed in the lower fornix is the medial portion and is indeed the Harderian gland. Periorbital lipoma in the guinea pig has not been described.

Obstruction of the excretory duct from exophthalmos is questionable.

In both cases, the Harderian gland was significantly larger in the vertical plane compared with measurements in the normal group. Bilateral mandibular fractures and elongated roots of the cheek teeth caused bilateral retrobulbar swelling and exophthalmos in one chinchilla. These findings were confirmed on computed tomography. The Harderian gland was enlarged in both orbits. Only one Chinchilla had unilateral exophthalmos in the study reported here. The contralateral Harderian gland was larger in this Chinchilla. However, it was not possible to determine whether Harderian gland size of the normal contralateral side may be affected by contralateral exophthalmos because of proximity between the gland and the optic foramina, similar to anatomic parallels that exist in the rabbit and guinea pig.
