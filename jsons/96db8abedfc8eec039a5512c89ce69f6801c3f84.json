            "text": "The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has already overwhelmed health systems in certain \"hot spots\" and has prompted intense discussion and planning elsewhere. Even though the pandemic appears to be slowing in some areas, concerns exist for a resurgence of the virus in the setting of relaxation of social distancing regulations, and for a more severe pandemic in the coming months. Intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, and personal protective equipment (PPE) have been, and may again become, scarce commodities for which construction and production lag behind need in most regions. Healthcare workers have also been in short supply, particularly when they fall ill and are quarantined, hospitalized, or succumb to the disease. This document therefore seeks to describe the salient clinical and ethical issues surrounding triage and rationing decisions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic (Central Illustration) and provide recommendations for cardiovascular clinicians (Figure 1) . The discussion and recommendations herein draw upon enduring principles ( Table 1 ) but also a current knowledge base that is in flux. The experience, science, and response to COVID-19 are rapidly changing and often depend on local practices and protocols. Table 1) . For the most part, these decisions will pertain to ICU beds, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits but may involve personal protective equipment (PPE) and other resources in short supply. Many cardiovascular clinicians involved in heart and/or lung transplantation are well-versed in processes that strive to maximize the beneficial use of scarce resources while ensuring fairness, and often prioritizing the sickest patients who are likely to benefit from intervention. These considerations influence both listing and allocation of organs and are also important in crisis standards of care during a pandemic. An important value implicit in age limits in listing for organ transplant is the concept of \"fair innings\" or \"life cycles\"-the idea that scarce resource distribution should favor those who have not had the opportunity to experience the full spectrum of life, rather than older patients who have already had their \"fair innings\". Employing this bias in favor of the young is more controversial in resource allocation during a pandemic than when applied to transplant listing.",

There is wide consensus that allocation decisions must not be made on the basis of perceived present or future social worth except, possibly, for one group-healthcare workers. An expected shortage of trained clinicians, in particular, provides the rationale for allocating scarce resources toward \"returning them to the battle.\" A number of controversial points emerge beyond questions of fairness that relate to relative instrumental or social value. All healthcare workers are not the same, and some are much more \"essential\" in the setting of a pandemic. For instance, clinicians with expertise in emergency medicine, critical care, and infectious disease could be seen to carry more \"instrumental value\" than general cardiologists. Furthermore, the level and duration of training impacts the ability to maintain the workforce-it takes longer to train a surgeon than a medical assistant. More broadly, there are other non-medical workers that are essential to a functioning society, from law enforcement, military personnel, and institutional leaders, to sanitation and delivery workers. Finally, clinicians' readiness to return to work soon after ICU stays is questionable, potentially attenuating the instrumental or social value of prioritizing them in regards to scarce resources. Preferentially allocating ICU beds and ventilators to clinicians is quite different in terms of social value than preferentially providing them with vaccines or prophylactic treatments.(5) These considerations must be balanced against the argument that the efforts of front-line healthcare workers should be recognized in allocation policies, especially in the setting of PPE shortages, at least as a bulwark against absenteeism.",

Normal standards of care can no longer be followed, needs must be triaged, and resources must be allocated to some patients but not others, and some resources will be reallocated (withdrawn from some patients and given to others). A true crisis involves region-wide shortages, not just shortages at a specific hospital. Triage decisions will involve all patients, not just those with COVID-19. In a crisis capacity situation, for instance, a ventilator should be allocated to a patient with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure instead of a patient with end stage heart failure patient if doing so would be likely to maximize benefits. Importantly, clinicians must not employ crisis standards of care when at contingency capacity. During both conventional and contingency standards of care, patient autonomy maintains its position of primacy in medical decision-making. Only in crisis standards of care must patient autonomy in some ways be subordinated to the larger goal of protecting the lives of as many patients as possible. Clinicians operating under contingency standards of care will experience a tendency to anticipate the next level, but should avoid inappropriate denial of care to certain patients or reallocating resources from one patient to another. Procedures deemed elective and those that can be safely postponed should be deferred. Resources should be conserved, but testing and therapeutic treatments necessary to avoid morbidity and mortality should be implemented.",

In many jurisdictions, triage teams, rather than bedside clinicians, will make decisions about which patients will receive life-sustaining intervention (allocation) and whether resources will be withdrawn from one patient and given to another (reallocation). (7) The principles and values under which these triage teams operate, the factors they consider in making decisions, and the composition of the teams, should be transparent, though the identities of individual team members may not. Decisions made by triage teams and the information and values upon which they are based are imperfect but necessary to alleviate moral distress for individual clinicians and may provide them legal protection. (8) Clinicians, with more detailed knowledge of individual patients, may find resulting decisions disappointing and even distressing. Procedures that attempt to avoid inappropriate bias however, must try to shield triage teams from the influence of factors that are relevant to the care of individuals but not to the fair allocation of scarce medical resources. Implementing decisions about reallocating resources from one patient to another may be much more difficult than withholding them, whether or not one made the decision. Reallocation of resources may be made after time-limited trials to see if recovery or improvement is possible, and if not, these resources might be reallocated to another patient. This is particularly true with the use of ECMO for the acute lung injury and myocarditis associated with COVID-19. Removing a lifesustaining therapy in order to provide it to a patient with a better chance of survival may compound the moral distress experienced by clinicians in crisis situations.",

This recommendation is typically made in a situation in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is deemed either medically inappropriate or physiologically futile, quantitatively futile (low chance of benefit) or qualitatively futile (unlikely to achieve goals of care) (9).

Assent (not consent) of the patient or surrogate may be sought, meaning that the patient or surrogate is asked to agree to allowing natural death, but the decision to not attempt CPR is not predicated on the agreement. Most unilateral DNAR policies require that patients and surrogates be fully informed of the process of determination to place a DNAR order and the reasons underlying the decision, including a clear explanation of the medical inappropriateness or futility of resuscitation attempts. Some require offer of transfer to another medical center. Clinicians require skills to refocus goals of care on palliation rather than life-prolongation if the latter is not meaningfully attainable. They must explicitly let patients and families know that they will manage symptoms and will not abandon the patient.(10) Acknowledgement of anticipatory bereavement on the part of the patient and family are essential to this conversation. It can take time for family and friends to process their grief and say goodbye, especially if they were previously unprepared to do so.

Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who have ventilator-dependent respiratory failure and progress to cardiorespiratory arrest in most cases would not be expected to derive benefit from CPR. Conversely, health care workers who administer CPR to patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of contracting the infection themselves due to enhanced infectious spread through aerosolization of viral particles during a \"code.\" There is a moral imperative to protect health care workers from undue harm, especially when patients are unlikely to benefit, in part because of the need to preserve their health so that they can continue to provide care to other patients. Furthermore, the scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE) raises questions about its use during a predictably futile resuscitation attempt. Although there is a general consensus that withholding and withdrawing are not ethically distinct, in practice it can be more emotionally difficult to withdraw life-sustaining interventions than to withhold them in triage situations. Clinicians, patients, surrogates, and patients' loved ones may view withdrawal as killing the patient, though it represents allowing the lifethreatening underlying illness to take its course. In cardiology, ethical controversy exists in relation to removing temporary and durable mechanical circulatory support, deactivating the shocking function of implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and turning off pacemakers, particularly in pacemaker-dependent patients (11) (12) (13) .",

However, in a nod to autonomy as a first principle, clinicians may not impose any treatments without a patient's informed consent. In a pandemic crisis, a clinician's paramount duty remains his or her commitment to individual patients, recognizing this may conflict with the duty of our profession as a whole to promote and protect public health when resources become scarce. As such, bedside physicians should not be expected to triage their own patients out of receiving what they consider optimal care, and these decisions instead should be made by an independent and impartial triage team.",

Unfortunately, the community's duty to steward scarce resources for populations comes into conflict with the duty of clinicians to promote the interests of individual patients under their care. Many difficult questions and the potential for confusion result in clinical decisions that unnecessarily compromise the health and welfare of both patients and healthcare workers. This document was commissioned by the leadership of the American College of Cardiology's COVID-19 Hub to help clinicians meet the unique challenges of the current pandemic. It does not, however, represent official policy of the ACC. The authors were chosen for their expertise in cardioethics, palliative care, and geriatric cardiology and were asked to rapidly prepare practical recommendations for ethically managing triage and other crucial issues.",

A clear distinction should be drawn between withholding and withdrawing decisions made by triage teams for triage purposes in a crisis situation, and withholding and withdrawing decisions made by the clinicians in the setting of inappropriate/futile interventions. Cardiovascular clinicians routinely face decisions to withhold interventions for patients with poor prognosis who are unlikely to benefit, or for whom the risk-benefit ratio is unfavorable. Percutaneous coronary intervention for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may be deemed inappropriate in patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and severe gastrointestinal bleeding.Structural heart procedures and mechanical circulatory support may be withheld from patients with advanced dementia.

These recommendations for clinicians describe important elements in triage, allocation, and patient care in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Conventional and Contingency Standards of Care do not involve decisions about allocation or reallocation of resources. Under Crisis Standard of Care, as declared by regional authorities, in most circumstances triage teams will make decisions. Nonetheless, cardiovascular clinicians at the bedside play a crucial role in providing care, conducting advance care planning, explaining the process of allocation and triage, and determining the appropriateness or futility of medical interventions, including resuscitative measures.
