In this regard, it makes sense for us to divide antigenicity into immunogenicity and allergenicity. This distinction allows for the characterization of all types of modern antigens, i.e., to evaluate and modify a priori the allergenicity of an antigen before it is applied to humans. In this chapter, we also formulated the hypothesis that \"Balanced Stimulation by Whole Antigens\" is essential for immune development. This hypothesis revives the practicality of the \"Hygiene Hypothesis\" and can provide a fundamental solution to curb the increasing prevalence of allergic disease, namely, early exposure, at 0-1 year old or earlier, in utero, of representative allergens/protein antigens with immunogenicity retained or improved and allergenicity attenuated or eliminated.",

            "text": "In textbooks, an antigen, also called an immunogen in some references, is a substance that binds to a specific antibody or is any molecule or molecular fragment that can be bound by a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and presented to a T cell receptor (TCR). Two features, antigenicity and immunogenicity, are generally used to describe each antigen. Immunogenicity is the ability to induce a humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response. Antigenicity is the ability to specifically combine with the final products of the immune response (i.e., secreted antibodies and/or surface receptors on T cells) (Owen et al. 2013) . Although all molecules that are immunogenic are also antigenic, the reverse is not true. If we carefully contemplate these two characteristics that are used to define an antigen, we discover that immunogenicity and antigenicity are tightly related and are always duplicated. Antibodies are produced as the result of immune induction, not from thin air. And antigens cannot trigger an immune response unless they bind with their corresponding antibodies or receptors. The above two concepts simply and repeatedly describe a single generality of all antigens, yet this alone does not allow us to completely characterize various antigens and cannot help us to understand antigens in various guises. However, different antigens produce different immune responses as they encounter their antibodies or receptors. Using this feature, antigens can be more accurately defined by the difference in the type of immune responses they induce. According to the classical definition of immunology, the major function of the immune system, as in the integrated anatomic system and other systems, is to avoid disease in the human body. The immune system has its own mechanisms for maintaining a general physiological balance in life by co-operating with other systems of the body. Here, we attempt to redefine and differentiate antigenicity into immunogenicity and allergenicity. We refer to antigenicity as the ability of an antigen to induce an immunological response when it is encountered by the human body. Antigenicity involves two types of immune characteristics, immunogenicity, and allergenicity. Immunogenicity refers to the ability of an antigen to trigger normal and protective immune responses after being encountered by the human body. We describe the immunogenicity of an antigen using the following three aspects: (1) the ability to defend the immune system (immunological defense), which is the ability to repel an exogenous antigen and to fight against infection;",

            "text": "The same observation has been made for the development of food allergy. Early consumption of peanuts in infancy is associated with a low prevalence of peanut allergy (Du Toit et al. 2008 Toit et al. , 2015 . Higher maternal intake of peanut, milk, and wheat during early pregnancy was associated with a decreased incidence of mid-childhood allergy and asthma (Bunyavanich et al. 2014 ). The role of diet, therefore, has been highlighted as a key factor that influences immune homeostasis and the development of allergic diseases (Julia et al. 2015) . There is no benefit to delaying the introduction of any potentially allergenic food, such as milk, eggs, peanuts, or fish food beyond 6 months of age to prevent food allergy (Chin et al. 2014) . Regarding the development of inhalant allergy, a similar conclusion has been drawn but with an exception for mites. It was demonstrated that early exposure to high levels (\u226510 \u00b5g/g dust) of dust mite allergen was associated with an increased risk of asthma and late-onset wheeze at age 7 years compared with exposure to low levels (< 0.05 \u00b5g/g dust) of dust mite allergen (Celedon et al. 2007 ). Also, pet exposure during the first year of life and an increasing number of siblings were both associated with a lower prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma in school children (Hesselmar et al. 2008 ). Some experts have argued that appropriately targeted allergic hypersensitivity evolved to elicit anticipatory responses and to promote avoidance of suboptimal environmental substances (Palm et al. 2012 ). However, if allergen avoidance really benefited the immune system, there would not be a need for the immune system to establish immune memory. On the other hand, different allergens belong to different groups (see Chap. 5 in this book). Single-allergen avoidance means avoiding an entire group of allergens, making complete avoidance impossible. Moreover, complete avoidance can cause malnutrition, mental retardation and lost enjoyment of life (Wang 2010) . Even worse, avoiding the consumption of certain substances may trigger defects in the immune system. In fact, our meta-analysis concluded that allergen avoidance may not always be successful in preventing allergic symptoms , especially for newborns.",

            "text": "A study of the prevalence of allergy in adults demonstrated that infection with pulmonary TB contributes significantly to atopy, particularly allergic rhinitis symptoms (Lin et al. 2013) . A pilot experiment showed the cross-reactivity between antigens from roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides (AL) and house dust mite (HDM) allergens (Acevedo et al. 2009 ). Another experiment with larger samples further demonstrated that AL-antigens can inhibit up to 92 % of HDM-specific IgE-reactivity among allergic subjects, while only up to 54 % of AL-specific IgE-reactivity among ascariasis subjects was inhibited by HDM allergens (Valmonte et al. 2012) , suggesting that AL antigens have broader and higher allergenicity than HDM allergens and noting that the latter would sensitize up to 70 % of the allergic population (He et al. 2014) . A further study from Hagel I et al. indicates that it only took a mild infection with A. lumbricoides (0-5000 eggs/g feces) to significantly elevate the levels of IL-13, IL-6, IL-10 as well as the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and no mention of IgE or IgG in this group, while in the moderately infected group (> 5001-50,000 eggs/g feces), IL-13 and IL-10 are very significantly increased but no increase of IgE, IgG, IFN-\u03b3, or IL-6 was observed in comparison with those in the urban nonparasitized control group. This result indicated that the protective response against allergy development by A. lumbricoides relies on IL-10 but is independent of the production of IFN-\u03b3, IgE, or IgG. These observations are complicated by concurrent infections with Giardia duodenalis and A. lumbricoides. A study evaluated the effect of A. lumbricoides on G. duodenalis infection and T H 1/T H 2 type immune mechanisms toward this parasite in 251 rural parasitized and 70 urban nonparasitized school children (Hagel et al. 2011 ). In the group of children mildly infected with A. lumbricoides, the levels of IgG, IgE, IL-13, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6 are all very significantly increased, while in the group of children moderately infected with A. lumbricoides, only IL-13 and IL-10 are highly elevated and IFN-\u03b3 is significantly increased but with no significant effects on the levels of IgG, IgE, or IL-6. These results suggest that A. lumbricoides can modulate the immune responses by affecting both T H 1 and T H 2 type immunity (Hagel et al. 2011) . Therefore, the conditions regarding the severity of the A. lumbricoides infection and whether or not co-infection with other species of parasites has occurred are very important in reaching the real conclusion. This information would have been helpful in a study (Palmer et al. 2002 ) that demonstrated in a cross-sectional sample of 2164 children that A. lumbricoides infection is associated with increased risk of childhood asthma and atopy in rural China but it did not contain detailed data on the above-mentioned two parameters. This could explain why previous studies of birth cohorts with participants in (sub)urban environments that examined similar associations have yielded inconsistent results. In conclusion, the protective immune response induced by parasites in humans is dependent on the particular parasite (Ek et al. 2012 ) and, therefore, discussion of the protective effects without the antibody and cytokine measurements (IgG, IgE, IL-13, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6) or investigation into the presence of co-infection is limited and insufficient. It is tempting to conclude that A. lumbricoides has high immunogenicity and low allergenicity and that this type of circumstance could significantly contribute to the maturation of our immune systems.",

This is similar to the situation seen with parasitic infections in children. The protective effect of infections strictly depends on the specific species and the microbial/parasitic burden. Thus, it is tempting to think that for immune system development and homeostasis, there are microbial and parasitic friends and foes that are very distinct and explicit. Therefore, to better characterize the antigen, it is crucial to know how harmful (allergenic) and how beneficial (immunogenic) the antigen is to the immune system.",

After a diagnosis of allergy, the affected cases would be treated by immunotherapy with these allergens.",

            "text": "(2) Regarding mechanisms, the maternal immune status is a key factor in whether the fetus is primed for a T H 1 or T H 2 response. A balanced level of T H 1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-10) provided by maternal T cells drives the direction of the homeostatic development of the initial T H 0 cells of the fetus that are then further educated for tolerance during infancy and improved by a balanced stimulation with all types of allergens, even if the developing immune status is T H 2-biased. Conversely, an unbalanced stimulation that lacks of one or more types of allergens in the first year of life would negatively influence the evolving balance and/or enhance any existing T H 2-biased immune status, thus allowing the development of allergic disease. Furthermore, maternal milk, a tight link between mothers and their children, contains free dietary and environmental allergens, IgM/IgG/IgA, tolerogenic factors (such as interleukin 10, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), lactoferrin, antioxidants, etc.), gut growth factors (such as cortisol, thyroxine, epidermal growth factor, TGF-\u03b2, etc.) and microbiota-influencing factors (such as prebiotics, oligosaccharides, casein, etc.). These factors can be transferred to the infant during breastfeeding. During childhood and adolescence ( Fig. 11 .1), tolerance develops to dietary and inhalant allergens and reinforces the immune system memory to these antigens (Julia et al. 2015) . (3) There is a necessity for lasting memory T cells to be restimulated in order to sustain their immortality and immunotolerance capability. It is the exposure of antigens in a certain space-time continuum that stimulate and reinforce the development of the immune system. During the na\u00efve stage, early exposure to superantigens with attenuated allergenicity could potentially strengthen and confer immune system tolerance to their allergenicity-untouched natural counterparts-this is similar to the process of allergen-specific immunotherapy. A good example comes from the progression of smallpox vaccination (Fig. 11 .2). Smallpox vaccines were originally made with whole smallpox virus that then evolved over generations to being made with the cowpox virus, which was actually a type of allergenicity attenuation that resulted in a vaccine that could therefore be safely administered to humans for protection against the smallpox virus ( Fig. 11 .2). It is tempting to speculate that other infectious diseases (SARS, AIDS, Ebola, etc.) could be eradicated by vaccination with their allergenicity-attenuated counterparts.",

He is engaged in otolaryngology diagnosis and research and has directed several clinical trials on the diagnosis and immunotherapy of allergic rhinitis. Prof. Zhang has received funding for many research projects and published dozens of research articles. His research focuses on novel immunotherapeutic methods and allergenicity evaluation and modification for toxins and transgenic candidate genes. Prof. Zhang significantly contributed to the hypothesis \"Balanced Stimulation by Whole Antigens.\" He is also interested in the integrated application of multiple surgical treatments and developed the Sleep Apnea Treatment Center. Prof. Zhang was given the Anti-SARS Advanced Individual of Guangdong and Guangzhou Award for his excellent contribution to SARS control in 2003 and received the Guangdong \"Outstanding Teachers\" Award for his exceptional teaching. His most recent research has been on allergy bioinformatics, allergy, and clinical immunology and disease models, such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, infection and inflammation induced by allergy, inflammatory, and protracted diseases caused by antigens or superantigens. He has gained experience in the field of allergology including the mechanisms of immune tolerance, allergy triggering factors, and chronic inflammation pathways and allergenicity evaluation and modification for food and drugs. He proposed some new concepts including \"Representative Major Allergens,\" \"Allergenicity Attenuation\" of immunotoxin and allergens, \"broad-spectrum immunomodulator\" as well as the theoretical hypothesis of \"Balanced Stimulation by Whole Antigens.\" Prof. TAO's laboratory focuses on the diagnosis of allergic disease and the medical evaluation of food and drug allergenicity and its modification. Prof. TAO has now constructed a",
