Prominent among which is the Level A quarantine, implemented on March 17, for all possible contacts of suspected SARS cases which eventually reached a total of 55,632 individuals quarantined, and Level B quarantine, implemented on April 28, of all travelers arriving at borders from affected areas which totaled 95,828 (see Table 1\nin Hsieh et al., 2005). Other intervention measures implemented during the outbreak include temperature monitoring, SARS fever hotline, hand washing, restricted access to all medical facilities, fever screening at designated local hospitals, as well as mandatory face mask wearing while in hospitals, public transportation, and other enclosed public places, most of which were also implemented on April 28, the day after the first SARS fatality had occurred in Taiwan. Mathematical modeling has also pinpointed the turning point of SARS infections in Taiwan to April 28 (Hsieh et al., 2004).",

A recent modeling study (Fraser et al., 2004) suggests that SARS, along with smallpox, is easier to control using these simple public health measures than HIV and Influenza. However, due to the current lack of evidence regarding infectivity of SARS-CoV prior to onset, quarantine for SARS did not seem to directly prevent infections during the incubation period in the traditional sense. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that quarantine served as a screening process for SARS whereby previous quarantined persons who showed onset of symptoms can be more swiftly diagnosed and sufficiently isolated once onset of symptoms occurs (Hsieh et al., 2005).",

Moreover, the value of border screening and Level B quarantine in deterring travel by ill persons and building public confidence remains unquantified up to now (Bell, 2004). (Zhang et al., 2005) used a continuous-time compartmental model to study the impact of quarantine for SARS in China. In this article we propose to use discrete time model to ascertain retrospectively and qualitatively the impact of Level A and B quarantine measures in Taiwan by making use of the laboratory confirmed SARS case data in Taiwan.",

The SARS case data contains the clinical data from onset to discharge or death and the quarantine status of 480 confirmed SARS cases in Taiwan, including 346 SARS cases that were officially confirmed by TCDC and additional 134 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV (Ab+) individuals who either had milder symptoms but were not clinically diagnosed as probable cases at the time of the outbreak, or probable cases who were previously ruled-out due to false negative PCR or Ab test results. These 134 cases were identified from a subsequent TCDC-sponsored large-scale seroepidemiological follow-up study to search for previously undiscovered SARS cases (Hsieh et al., 2005). All seropositive cases from this study were confirmed by two different serological tests to detect anti-SARS-CoV antibody once discrepancies occurred. The ongoing laboratory test results of these newly laboratory confirmed cases are updated as of November of 2004. The resulting percentages of all Level A and B quarantined persons who had been confirmed as SARS-CoV(+) cases are, respectively, 0.041% and 0.001%. The quarantine status of imported cases is given in Table 1.",

The detailed description of the 3SLS estimation procedure is given in the Appendix. To simplify the estimation, we will make use of previously published estimates of the model parameters for Taiwan SARS, whenever available. In Hsieh et al. (2005), the mean onset-to-diagnosis times for quarantined and unquarantined individuals were computed from the Taiwan SARS case data to be 1.20 days and 2.89 days, respectively, hence we obtain \u03bc\n2=1/1.2=0.833 and \u03bc\n1=1/2.89=0.346 for the respective removal rates of the quarantine and unquarantined infective. Moreover, also from the result in Hsieh et al. (2005), we can obtain \u03c9=1/7.55=0.132 for the reclassification rate of the hospitalized persons.",

            "text": "\n(1)In a fast spreading infectious disease with unknown or uncertain knowledge of the etiological agent, the effectiveness and efficiency of control efforts are of the highest priority. The quarantine rate q gives a measure of the efficiency, or the speed, at which a potential Level A quarantine case is actually being quarantined. Thus quarantine rate of 0.047 estimated over the time period 2/25\u20136/25 indicates that, on a daily basis, only one out of every 21 exposed persons who should be quarantined was actually quarantined. This reflects the need for more efficient real-time contact tracing during the outbreak in order to seek out potential infected persons for quarantine, observation, and swift diagnosis when onset of symptoms occurs. One should note, however, that the data used includes many mild cases that were not clinically diagnosed and hence their exposed contacts were not traceable. This would result in a significantly lower quarantine rate than the one computed from using clinically diagnosed SARS cases only. Hence the efficiency of contact tracing and quarantine is also dependent on correct diagnosis of symptomatic infective individuals, which could be severely lacking in the early stages of a newly emerging disease such as witnessed during the past SARS outbreak.(2)The contribution to infections by the previously quarantined (Jn) and hospitalized (Hn) persons appeared to be insignificant when compared with the infection by the infectives in In. This does not mean infections by Jn and Hn had not occurred, merely that their effects were relatively insignificant. In fact, 80% of the officially confirmed SARS cases in Taiwan were acquired in hospitals (Ho and Su, 2004), but the many of them occurred prior to the patients\u2019 hospitalization as a suspected SARS case, while they were in outpatient clinics, observation rooms, and emergency rooms, sometimes for other illness, where the patients often stayed for hours and sometimes for days before being moved (Jiang et al., 2003a, Jiang et al., 2003b). Many of those infected were also in the hospital as healthcare workers, hospital staff, and visitors. This also indicates that, in term of intervention, rapid initial detection is much more important than subsequent classification of probable cases.(3)By comparison, a perfect Level A quarantine (which aimed to quarantine all asymptomatic cases as soon as they were potentially exposed) results in more drastic reduction of cases than a perfect Level B quarantine. However, it is intuitive that if all imported cases were effectively isolated, there would be no local outbreak. Indeed, from our result the timeliness of Level B quarantine is important, as indicated by the difference in the reduction of cases by the two quarantined imported cases. Given the controversial nature of full-scaled quarantine of international travelers, appropriate mathematical modeling is required to provide evidence-based criterion for public health authority to determine its swift implementation. The difficulty and scope involved in a successful quarantine, as quantified in Table 3, Table 4, gives strong indication that quarantine must be combined with other intervention measures for successful and swift containment of an outbreak. The results also corroborate with previous studies of intervention measures for SARS outbreak where hospital-wide case isolation is found to be more important than quarantine (see e.g., Day et al., 2006; Gumel et al., 2004; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2003; Webb et al., 2004).(4)The simulation results in Table 3, Table 4 highlight the effect an efficient quarantine measure could have on significantly reducing the magnitude of the outbreak. We emphasize, however, that the numbers of reduction and increase in cases and deaths shown in Table 3, Table 4 are not to be taken literally, but to be consider qualitatively as a measure of the magnitude of the effect brought on by the various hypothetical scenarios for the purpose of comparing different control measures. However, there is ample evidence that superspreading events had played a significant role in the 2003 outbreaks (Li et al., 2004; Riley et al., 2003) which was not singled out in our model.(5)Finally, the effect of public response to outbreak and behavior change to prevent infection is most difficult to quantify. Question remains as to how one can pinpoint the degree of effectiveness or the relative importance of different measures implemented. One may never know for certain how important temperature monitoring or hand washing had been to the containment of the outbreak, or what role, if any, did mandatory face mask wearing in public transportation systems play, or whether the decrease in infection rate is merely due to the psychological effect of outbreak and the subsequent behavior change by the general population to simply try to stay home and avoid contacts\u2014especially since multiple prevention measures were co-operating at the same time in blocking all possible channels of the transmission of SARS-CoV. One thing is certain, all of these intervention measures and the subsequent individual behavior changes combined to prevent the past SARS epidemic from being more catastrophic than it was, and will be our best defense when the next emerging infectious disease approaches.\n",
