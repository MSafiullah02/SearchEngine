The mortality rates of the disease reached as high as 15% in some age groups (Anand et al., 2003). The etiological agent was found to be a novel coronavirus, which was named the SARS\u2013coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). Analysis of the viral genome has demonstrated that the SARS\u2013CoV is phylogenetically divergent from the three known antigenic groups of coronaviruses (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003). However, analysis of the polymerase gene alone, indicated that the SARS\u2013CoV may be an early offshoot from the group 2 coronaviruses (Snijder et al., 2003).",

The S glycoprotein is primarily responsible for entry of all coronaviruses into susceptible cells through binding to specific receptors on cells and facilitating subsequent virus\u2013cell fusion (Cavanagh, 1995). The S glycoprotein specified by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits, although cleavage is not necessarily required for virus\u2013cell fusion (Bos et al., 1997, Gombold et al., 1993, Stauber et al., 1993). Similarly, the SARS\u2013CoV S glycoprotein may be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits in Vero E6-infected cells (Wu et al., 2004), while it is not known whether this cleavage affects S-mediated cell fusion. The SARS\u2013CoV receptor was identified as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003).",

Generally, upon receptor binding at the cell membrane, the S glycoprotein is thought to undergo a dramatic conformational change causing exposure of a hydrophobic fusion peptide, which is subsequently inserted into cellular membranes. This conformational change of the S glycoprotein causes close apposition of viral and cellular membranes followed by membrane fusion resulting in entry of the virion nucleocapsids into cells (Eckert and Kim, 2001, Tsai et al., 2003, Zelus et al., 2003). This series of S-mediated virus entry events is similar to other class I virus fusion proteins (Baker et al., 1999, Melikyan et al., 2000, Russell et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Based on structural similarities, two classes of viral fusion proteins have been established (Kielian, 2006, Lescar et al., 2001). Class I viral fusion proteins, such as the SARS\u2013CoV S glycoprotein contain two heptad repeat regions and an N-terminal or N-proximal fusion peptide (Fig. 1). Class II viral fusion proteins lack heptad repeat regions and contain an internal fusion peptide (Lescar et al., 2001). Typically, the ectodomains of the S2 subunits of coronaviruses contain two heptad regions, HR1 and HR2 located proximal to the transmembrane region (de Groot et al., 1987) (Fig. 1). These HRs form a six-helix bundle having three \u03b1-helices formed by HR1 and three antiparallel HR2 \u03b1-helices. Formation of this six-helix bundle brings the fusion peptide in close proximity to the TMD of the S glycoprotein, a prerequisite step to membrane fusion (Bosch et al., 2003). Although the structure of the HR1\u2013HR2 complex has been solved in peptide reconstitution experiments (Ingallinella et al., 2004), the conformational changes that result in the six-helix bundle are not known. Presumably, S binding to cellular receptor and/or activation by low-pH conditions initiates the cascade of conformational events that result in the six-helix bundle, which is ultimately stabilized by the HR affinities for each other. The fusion peptide of the coronavirus S glycoprotein is predicted to be at the N-terminus of S2 (Sainz et al., 2005).",

Specifically for coronaviruses, the MHV S glycoprotein carboxyl terminus was shown to contain cysteine-rich regions, which were critical for fusion of infected cells (Bos et al., 1995, Chang et al., 2000, Ye et al., 2004). The SARS\u2013CoV S glycoprotein has relatively high (3%) cysteine content (39 residues). Nine of the cysteine resides are concentrated in a region that spans the putative TMD and the cytoplasmic domain, with six of these residues being well conserved among different coronaviruses (Fig. 1). The precise boundaries of the S TMD specified by different coronaviruses are not known, and different predictions include or exclude part of the cysteine-rich domain as part of the TMD (Broer et al., 2006, Chang et al., 2000, Godeke et al., 2000, Ye et al., 2004). Inclusion of part of the cysteine-rich motif produces a TMD of 34 amino acids, which is longer than necessary to cross the membrane (Broer et al., 2006).",

Specifically, substitution of the cytoplasmic portion of the cysteine-rich region including the cytoplasmic tail of MHV S with the cytoplasmic tail of the VSV-G protein abolished MHV S glycoprotein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion (Bos et al., 1995). Other studies showed that while the cysteine-rich domain was not the sole functional domain of the transmembrane anchor required for fusion activity, it was apparently necessary for fusion activity (Chang et al., 2000).",

Predictions cited in the literature for different coronaviruses place part of the cysteine-rich carboxyl terminal motif within the TMD(Broer et al., 2006). The Web-based algorithm Prediction of Transmembrane Regions and Orientation (TMPpred), predicts amino acid residues 1198\u20131215 (VWLGFIAGLIAIVMVTILL) as a strongly preferred model TMD and the sequence 1199\u20131219 (LGFIAGLIAIVMVTILLCCM) as an alternative model TMD. In contrast, the Classification and Secondary Structure Prediction of Membrane Proteins (SOSUI) WEB-based algorithm (Hirokawa et al., 1998) predicts the amino acid residues 1201\u20131223 (GFIAGLIAIVMVTILLCCMTSCC) as a potential TMD. For presentation and discussion purposes as well as for reasons that will become apparent in the discussion section of this paper, we have chosen to represent the TMD as predicted by TMPpred, which places the entire cysteine-rich motif as part of the S endodomain (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n). In a recent manuscript, we referred to the cysteine-rich regions as cysteine clusters CRM1 and CRM2 (Petit et al., 2005). In this work, we have further subdivided CRM1 into cysteine clusters CL-I and CL-II, and CRM2 into cysteine clusters CL-III and CL-IV (Fig. 2). To elucidate the role of the S carboxyl terminal cysteine-rich domains in membrane fusion, intracellular transport, and cell surface expression, mutated S genes carrying cysteine cluster-to-alanine mutations were constructed by replacing all cysteine residues within the CL-I, CL-II, CL-III or CL-IV positions generating S mutant genes mCL-I, mCL-II, mCL-III and mCL-IV, respectively (Fig. 2).",

Carbohydrate addition was shown to occur in at least four different locations of the SARS\u2013CoV S glycoprotein (Krokhin et al., 2003, Ying et al., 2004). Furthermore, transiently expressed S glycoprotein in Vero E6 cells can be proteolytically cleaved into S1 and S2 components (Wu et al., 2004). The anti-S monoclonal antibody SW-111 detected a protein species in cellular extracts from transfected cells, which migrated with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa, as reported previously (Song et al., 2004). All mutated S glycoproteins produced similar S-related protein species in comparison with the wild-type S indicating that none of the engineered mutations adversely affected S synthesis and intracellular processing (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained when the mCL-I and mCL-II mutations were combined into the S mutant form mCL-I + II (not shown).",

To determine if the SARS S was also palmitoylated , transiently expressed wild-type S and mutant forms containing cysteine-to-alanine substitutions were assayed for their ability to incorporate [3H] palmitic acid. After labeling, the cellular lysates were electrophoretically separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and visualized by fluorography (see Materials and methods) (Fig. 6A). The wild-type S produced a protein species at the expected apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa, which indicates that the SARS\u2013CoV S is palmytoylated. Similarly, each S mutant produced an S-related protein species with the expected molecular mass of full-size S. However, only the mCL-IV mutant appeared to be palmitoylated as well as the wild-type S (Fig. 6A). To determine the relative level of S palmitoylation, all S protein species film images obtained by autoradiography were scanned, digitally analyzed, and normalized to the total protein of the sample obtained by spectrophotometry (not shown). The amount of palmitoylation was then expressed as a ratio to the relative amount of wild-type S (see Materials and methods). Palmitoylation of the mCL-I and mCL-II mutants was reduced by 56% and 49%, respectively. Palmitoylation of the mCL-III mutant was at similar levels to the wild-type S while palmitoylation of the mCL-IV mutant was reduced by approximately 5%. (Fig. 6B).",

Analysis of the different S mutants revealed that the two cysteine clusters proximal to the TMD are major sites for S palmitoylation, since 3H-palmitic acid incorporation was significantly reduced in the mCL-I and mCL-II cluster mutations. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that combination of the mCL-I and mCL-II mutations into S mutant form mCL-I + II reduced palmitoylation by more than 80% in comparison to the wild-type S. In contrast, the mCL-III and mCL-IV mutations did not drastically affect 3H-palmitic acid incorporation into these S mutant glycoproteins indicating that these cysteine residues are probably not efficiently palmitoylated.

Furthermore, none of the mutations including the double mutant mCL-I + II significantly affected the levels of S cell-surface expression. These results strongly suggest that palmitoylation of cysteine residues within the carboxyl terminus of S is important for S mediated cell fusion with the proximal to the TMD cysteines being primary sites for palmitoylation. Based on the low levels of reduction of S-mediated cell fusion by the S-mutant forms mCL-III and mCL-IV, as well as the low level of palmytoylation of the S-mutant form mCL-I + II, it is possible that the cysteine residues altered in the mCL-III and mCL-IV mutations are also inefficiently palmitoylated.

The findings that the carboxyl terminus portion of the SARS\u2013CoV S glycoprotein is palmitoylated substantially strengthen our transmembrane prediction model that places the palmitoylated cysteine residues proximal, but not within the TMD. Apparently, palmitoylation of these cysteine residues is not necessary for plasma membrane transport and anchoring, since none of the mutations seemed to drastically affect intracellular transport and cell-surface expression. However, palmitoylation may provide additional anchoring during extracellular receptor binding and S-mediated cell fusion, which must produce substantial stresses on TMD anchoring. Alternatively, it is possible that cytoplasmic conformational changes mediated by palmitoylation and other modifications alter the ability of the extracellular portion of S to assume the proper conformation required for optimum cell fusion, implying a signal transduction mechanism between the intracellular and extracellular domains.",
