Currently unanswered questions are why elderly people, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities seem to exhibit higher mortality rates after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether intensive care becomes indispensable for these patients to prevent multi-organ failure and sudden death. To face these challenges, we here summarize the molecular insights into viral infection mechanisms and implications for cardiovascular disease. Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body. The wide range of affected organs is presumably based on the common expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry-receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Physiologically, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, the master regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thereby converting it into vasodilatory molecules, which have well-documented cardio-protective effects. Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD. This, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell-entry, have spurred controversial discussions on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients.",

First studies were initiated mainly on Chinese cohorts, as China is the suspected point of origin of These studies indicate that patients subjected to intensive care units (ICU) frequently show hypertension, diabetes and/or cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [2, 3] . These patients demonstrate much higher mortality rates compared with patients that are free of these comorbidities [4] [5] [6] [7] . While higher mortality rates among CVD patients are also associated with other respiratory diseases (especially influenza virus-induced flu or previous SARS epidemics), the question was put forward, whether people treated for heart-related illness are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, based on first epidemiological evidence, but particularly based on the presumed upregulation of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor. While this association is currently heavily discussed, and will be also be a subject of this review, latest epidemiological studies coming from Europe at least underpin the greater risk for a critical disease progression in this group of patients [8, 9] . Therefore, we here aim to outline the mechanisms influencing the cardiac system because of its central implications in the COVID-19 course.

The major differences revoking such comparison are: firstly, a suspected high prevalence for asymptomatic disease spreaders; secondly, a prolonged incubation period compared to common seasonal influenza viruses; and thirdly, an extended disease progression, reflected by an average ICU stay of 15 days with a minimum of 10 days in Italy [13, 20] .

To date, there is no indisputable evidence for myocarditis in deceased COVID-19 patients, which requires confirmation through a biopsy or an autopsy. Therefore, to address whether inflammation of the cardiac muscle contributes to the observed heart failure (HF), additional investigations are still necessary. A second assumption that is currently pursued, is that an over-activated immune system is predominantly contributing to SARS-CoV-2-induced heart damage. Subsequent to cardiac ischemia as a consequence of pneumonia and the associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [7, 31, 32] , CMC damage and death induces a variety of pro-inflammatory mechanisms, which in turn spiral out of control and further promote loss of CMCs [33] . Hence, a secondary induced cardiac injury seems to be quite likely, although specific evidence is still lacking owing to the currently tense clinical situation. However, these ideas are strongly endorsed by previous studies investigating the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 or later on the MERS-CoV-associated epidemic in 2012 [34, 35] , where acute myocarditis and heart failure have also been reported [36] . Similar long-term implications on the cardiovascular system as observed in a study for SARS-CoV can only be suggested [37] .",

Interestingly, the drastically increased mortality rate in patients with pre-existing or new cardiac injuries is associated with elevated serum levels of troponin T (TnT), a biomarker for cardiac damage. Indeed, the study of Guo et al. points out that CVD patients without significantly raised TnT serum levels only represent a slightly increased mortality compared to patients without CVD [23, 38] . Therefore, in the case of expected cardiac damage due to distinct comorbidities or severe disease progression, TnT levels should always be strictly monitored, but also critically interpreted since some medications and interventions themselves can cause an upregulation of TnT [39] [40] [41] . Together with other biomarkers such as the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and Ferritin as well as D-dimers [26, 33, 42, 43] , TnT may be used to predict the outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and aid in clinical decision making for the best possible treatment options, which ultimately help to reduce COVID-19 mortality [44, 45] .",

ACE2 is an important regulator of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which systemically influences the vasculature and blood pressure via distinct hormones. This endocrine system additionally regulates the fluid and electrolyte balance in the kidneys. Briefly, the peptide prorenin is cleaved in the kidneys and activated renin is then released into the blood stream where it in turn activates angiotensinogen, which is converted into angiotensin I and finally into angiotensin II (AngII).",

However, ACE2 is a well-characterized negative regulator of the RAAS system as it converts AngII into the vasodilatory fragment Ang 1-7, which simultaneously decreases the AngII concentration to further facilitate the antihypertensive effect [52, 53] . ACE2 is located on the cell surface e.g. in the renal, cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems [54] , providing an explanation for the observed symptoms of COVID-19. In the following part of this review, we will highlight potentially connective mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and the dysregulated presentation of ACE2 with the described clinical features in the context of cardiac injury.",

Receptor binding is facilitated through the viral spike protein that is processed by the protease TMPRSS2 [47] . Then, the spike protein interacts with the extracellular domain of ACE2, which triggers clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the complex [47, 55, 56] . Interestingly, this interaction is remarkably enhanced in patients suffering from hypertension or coronary heart disease as well as in diabetic or other comorbid conditions [57] [58] [59] . While elevated plasmin or plasminogen levels have already been associated with patients suffering from these medical conditions, the impact of these increased J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof levels on viral infections was only very recently highlighted by Ji et al. [60] . The viral spike protein is cleaved at a furin site, which is not present in SARS-CoV, by the furin protease plasmin, thereby increasing the cellular uptake of viral particles and enhancing its pathogenicity [56, 60] . Furthermore, there is an association of elevated plasmin levels with the strong induction of D-dimer as a product of hyper-fibrinolysis, which is an additional critical parameter of severe COVID-19 progression [42, 43, 61] .",

In addition to producing infectious progeny, several mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication influence ACE2 expression and presentation. Firstly, internalization of the receptor is accompanied by a reduced availability on the cell surface. Secondly, so far unknown viral mediators inhibit ACE2 and concurrently induce ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM-17) gene expression [53, 62] . The membrane-bound metalloprotease is involved in processing the tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), but is also functioning as a \"sheddase\" by releasing anchored receptors and cytokines [63] . As a physiological regulator of the RAAS system, ADAM-17 mediates cleavage of ACE2, pointing towards its direct involvement in COVID-19 [53] . Thirdly, not only the release of TNF\u03b1 [63] , but also processing of different important pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) is accomplished [62, 64, 65] . The latter two act directly on ACE2 expression via autocrine pathways [65] , further promoting the downregulation of ACE2 on the cellular surface of infected cells, and might secondary imply an imbalance of T cell responses and over-reaction of the immune system by provoking a cytokine storm (Figure 1 ).",

Considering that many patients suffer from pre-existing illness and elderly people present a compromised immune system [2, 3, 66] , the severity and the potential life-threat of a SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes very clear. The treatment plan of CVD patients regularly includes inhibitors of the RAAS, namely ACE-I and ARBs. Recently, upregulation of ACE2 has been associated with RAAS inhibitor medication [67] [68] [69] . The point was recently raised that the susceptibility in those patients is even increased based on high viral loads that were detected in patients with poor outcomes [30, 70] . A broad spectrum of institutions and scientist have discussed this topic extensively as treatment guidelines were and are still required very urgently because of the rapidly growing number of cases. Summarizing the most important J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof aspects of this ongoing discussion, antihypertensive drugs should not be discontinued if there is no medical necessity, as uncontrolled blood pressure or clinical instability is a superior high-risk factor for severe complications [71] . So far, there is no evidence of increased susceptibility of hypertensive patients; on the contrary, studies in Chinese cohorts suggest an even lower estimated prevalence of COVID-19 in blood-pressure controlled subjects compared to the distribution of high blood pressure in the population in general [31, 46] . Indeed, a retrospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension identified a lower risk of all-cause mortality in patients under ACE-I and ARB treatment [72] .",

Therefore, a clinical trial was initiated at the end of February aiming to re-raise ACE2 levels without risking increased infection rates. Here, soluble human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) infusions were planned in a COVID-19 patient cohort consisting of 24 participants [76] . The conceptual idea is that the non-membrane-bound receptor functions as a trap for viral particles by intercepting SARS-CoV-2, thereby preventing binding to cell surface-located ACE2 and the subsequent infection.",

Here, we highlight some of these therapeutic strategies, which have a special focus on adjuvant therapies to prevent cardiac injury. As mentioned above, high plasmin/plasminogen levels are often abundant in distinct comorbidities, and can therefore serve as a predictive biomarker for risk assessment [60] . It has already been demonstrated in vitro that specific protease inhibitors impair viral entry and based on these results [42] , first protease inhibitors are administered in COVID-19 patients in China [79, 80] . In this context, the study of Hoffmann et al. revealed that the protease TMPRSS2 is critically involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, so that specific inhibitors or antibodies might have a beneficial effect [47] . Antiviral activity has also been shown for Remdesivir, an inhibitor of the viral RNA polymerase, currently used in the clinics.",

Whether COVID-19 has direct or indirect effects to the young or aged cardiovascular system is poorly understood so far because we are only at the beginning of monitoring the COVID-19. This includes specific biomarker discovery to predict patients at J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof very high risk as well as superior imaging tools to monitor cardiac remodeling and inflammation (e.g. MRI). Especially ACE2 abundancy is of high interest in context of SARS-CoV-2 and a potential impact on cardiac tissue; however, insufficient number of cases has been reported so far to draw reliable conclusion and rhACE2 is rather considered a therapeutic strategy to limit viral infection, which will be now investigated in phase-II clinical trials.

            "text": "Overview about the role of ACE-2 during SARS CoV-2 infection. Angiotensin II can either bind to the angiotensin II receptor type I (AT 1 -R), where it induces vasoconstriction via the phospholipase C (PLC), proteinkinase C (PKC) pathway, or be processed by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to generate angiotensin 1-7. Afterwards, angiotensin 1-7 can bind to the MAS-receptor (Mas-R), which induces a signaling cascade subsequently leading to a vasodilatory effect. During SARS CoV-2 infection, viral spike protein (S) on the surface of the virus binds to ACE2. After processing of the S-protein by the endogenous transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the viral particle is endocytosed and acidification of the endosome leads to viral and cellular membrane fusion and release of viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into the cytosol. There, the ssRNA is replicated and translated into viral proteins (N, M, E and S). Additional viral mechanisms facilitate the downregulation of endogenous ACE2 and upregulation of ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM-17) expression. After vesicular transport to the cell surface, ADAM-17 facilitates its role as a \"sheddase\" and cleaves the extracellular domain of ACE2. Moreover, increased extracellular cytokine concentrations (TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-4) lead to the activation of cellular proinflammatory pathways by different cytokine receptors. These pathways further support virus-induced downregulation of ACE2 and upregulation of ADAM-17.",
