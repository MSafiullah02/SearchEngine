Numerous studies have proposed the use of probiotics to improve gut health in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (Heselmans et al. 2005; Chaves et al. 2011) and in the prevention of antibiotic\u2010induced diarrhoea (Song et al. 2011). One of the foremost allegations of these studies regards the ability of probiotics to protect against several infectious agents, especially against enteropathogens (Cremonini et al. 2002; Maragkoudakis et al. 2010). The protective effects of certain probiotic strains against specific pathogens are undeniable; however, the scientific basis of the means by which probiotics confer protection must be well established. A great number of protective mechanisms have been proposed in protective studies such as stabilization of the gut mucosal barrier (Yan et al. 2007), stimulation of mucus secretion by goblet cells (Dogi and Perdig\u00f3n 2006; Ohland and MacNaughton 2010), competition for nutrients, secretion of antimicrobial substances (bacteriocins) and the modulation of mucosal and systemic immune responses (Lebeer et al. 2008; Castillo et al. 2012).",

In most animals, these beneficial gut bacteria interact actively with other micro\u2010organisms belonging to the indigenous microbiota and with transient pathogens, inhibiting the installation of exogenous or uncontrolled multiplication of commensals (Fagundes et al. 2011). It has been demonstrated that probiotics can replace conventional growth promoters, such as antibiotics, especially in newborn animals (Jouany and Morgavi 2007; Castillo et al. 2012).",

The selection criteria of new strains for application as probiotic involves in vitro testing for adequate gastrointestinal transit, antimicrobial activity against microbial pathogens, susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents, and survival during processing and storage (Silva et al. 2013). Subsequently, the promising strains tested in vitro undergo subsequent in vivo challenge. However, some doubts persist regarding the real value of some of the in vitro selection criteria for micro\u2010organisms to be used as health\u2010promoting agents. A critical rethinking of these selection criteria seems necessary to improve the process of development of better probiotics (Morelli 2000).",

Lactic acid bacteria produce different antimicrobial components, such as organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, carbon peroxide, diacetyl, low molecular weight antimicrobial substances, bacteriocins and adhesion inhibitors (Servin 2004; Ripamonti et al. 2011). The adhesiveness of LAB can involve passive forces, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic steric forces, lipoteicoic acids and lectins (Servin 2004). The hydrophobic nature of the outermost surfaces of micro\u2010organisms facilitates the adhesion of bacteria to the host epithelium, thereby conferring competitive advantages during colonization of the gastrointestinal tract (Vinderola and Reinheimer 2003). The antimicrobial susceptibility of intestinal micro\u2010organisms is an important criterion for the selection of probiotic strains, likely because of the possibility of lateral gene transfer to the potentially pathogenic or commensal bacteria that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract (Mathur and Singh 2005; Ripamonti et al. 2011).",

Unfortunately, many so\u2010called probiotics have not been properly proved in veterinary and medical practice, yet various producers make generic health claims that lead consumers to believe that they are using safe, reliable and efficacious products. However, the generalized prophylactic use of these \u2018probiotics\u2019 by consuming \u2018functional\u2019 foods or dietary supplements could establish a scenario in the host that is favourable to initial infection by and spread of some pathogens. It could occur not only as a result of changes in the \u2018healthy\u2019 microbiota leading to or associated with a disease but also by altering locally and systemically the immunological status of the host (Reid et al. 2003).",

To isolate LAB and to assess their functional properties, the faecal specimens were homogenized using a glass rod in sterile tubes containing 0\u00b79% saline. Serial saline dilutions were plated onto de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar (Difco, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in an anaerobic chamber (Forma Scientific Inc., Marietta, OH) containing an atmosphere of 85% N2, 10% H2 and 5% CO2. Distinct colonies were selected and processed by Gram staining and bacterial morphology examination. Gram\u2010positive bacteria with a bacillus or coccobacillus morphology were assayed for catalase activity, and those that were negative were considered to be probable LAB. The isolates were regularly cultured by inoculation in MRS broth with 1% v/v of a fresh stationary culture and incubation in anaerobic conditions at 37\u00b0C for 18 h.

ITS amplification could establish three groups of LAB genera: Streptococcus/Lactococcus with one amplicon, Enterococcus with two amplicons of different sizes and Lactobacillus/Weissella/Pediococcus with three amplicons of different sizes. In this study, ARDRA was used to identify LAB isolated from the faeces of young foals. Of the 33 LAB isolates, 30 had three amplicons and belonged to the Lactobacillus/Weissella/Pediococcus group, whereas three had two amplicons and belonged to the Enterococcus group. Weissella confusa was the most prevalent species, accounting for more than 50% of LAB isolates. This result agreed with the findings of Endo et al.

The pH of the stomach of horses ranges between 2\u00b75 and 5\u00b76, and ingested feed persists for approximately 2\u20136 h in the stomach of the animal (Voros 2008; Botha 2011). Weese et al.

This survival rate was considered adequate, and some isolates were considered acid\u2010tolerant. Most of the isolates in the current study (97%) showed a percentage of inhibition at a pH of 2\u00b75 for 3 h at 37\u00b0C of <10%. This rate of inhibition could also be considered adequate.

The mean bile concentration in the small intestine is 0\u00b73% w/v, and it was used to select new probiotic strains (Mainville et al. 2005). The percentage of resistance to bile salts has also tended to vary among LAB and even between strains of the same species (Mirlohi et al. 2009; Silva et al. 2013). In equines, bile is continuously released in the small intestine because horses do not have a biliary vesicle in the gastrointestinal tract (Botha 2011). We considered an isolate to be resistant if it exhibited inhibition rates of <40%, tolerant if the inhibition rates ranged from 40% to 60%, and sensitive if the inhibition rates were >60%. Weese et al.

Five of the 18 isolates showed antagonistic activity against six bacterial pathogens. Salmonella infection is the most common cause of acute diarrhoea in foals, and it has zoonotic potential (Mastroeni and Grant 2011). It is therefore the most important pathogen to be antagonized by our candidates for probiotics. In this study, 45% of the isolates from equine faeces showed antagonistic activity towards the Salm. enterica serovar Typhimurium (ATCC 14028), consistent with the literature claiming that these bacteria produce lactic acid, which would be sufficient to inhibit the growth of this pathogen (Weese et al. 2004).

However, the study did not test if the in vitro inhibitory activity of these isolates against Salmonella ATTC 14028, including Ped. pentosaceus 40, can be applicable to the strain used for in vivo assays. In the present study, it was also found that 28% of isolates exhibited antagonistic activity against Ent. faecalis, which is another LAB. This finding suggested that substances other than lactic acid were acting as antagonists.",

            "text": "Lactic acid bacteria that are widely used as probiotics or in starter cultures have the potential to host antibiotic resistance genes, thus presenting a risk of transferring such genes to many LAB and other pathogenic bacteria (Mathur and Singh 2005). Plasmid\u2010linked antibiotic resistance is not very common among LAB, but it does occur, and safety implications should be considered. Strains harbouring resistance plasmids should not be used as human or animal probiotics. Assessing the capacity of a proposed probiotic strain to act as a donor for conjugative antibiotic resistance genes could be a sensible precaution in some instances (Ripamonti et al. 2011). Knowledge of the intrinsically coded resistance of LAB to common antibiotics is necessary for recognizing acquired resistance traits. All the isolates exhibited the same antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. All of them were resistant to vancomycin, oxacillin and amikacin but sensitive to erythromycin, penicillin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin. Micro\u2010organisms belonging to other genera of LAB (Enterococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Weissella) have been emphasized as having intrinsic resistance to vancomycin (Wright 2003; Mathur and Singh 2005). The results were consistent with numerous studies often reporting a high degree of resistance of LAB to the antibiotic classes of glycopeptides (vancomycin), aminoglycosides (amikacin) and oxacillin (Bywater 2005; Ammor et al. 2007). The strains analysed were susceptible to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol and erythromycin. Lactic acid bacteria sensitive to these antibiotics have been commonly reported in scientific articles (Klare et al. 2007). Danielsen and Wind (2003) reported high sensitivity of LAB to the presence of inhibitors of cell wall synthesis, such as ampicillin and penicillin.",

Thus, the criteria used in this work for the evaluation of probiotic bacteria were based on in vitro evaluation of functional properties, as well as the known behaviour of this strain under each of the evaluated conditions. By analysing their functional characteristics, Ped. pentosaceus strain 40 was chosen for an in vivo trial in a mouse model of Salmonella infection.",

Salmonella Typhimurium have the ability to translocate to the visceral organs of mice causing a systemic infection, a major determinant of this micro\u2010organism's pathogenicity (Grassl et al. 2008). So an increase was observed in the mice challenge groups liver score, as expected. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are often reported as indicative of indirect bacterial infection. In this work mice treated with only Ped. pentosaceus 40 showed no macroscopic changes in the liver. Based on liver histological score analyses, we believe that Ped. pentosaceus 40 alone is safe, but has a synergistic effect on Salmonella pathogenesis, which could include increase gut permeability (discussed below).",

TNF\u2010\u03b1 and INF\u2010\u03b3 are key mediators of cell recruitment into the lesions, and they induce activation and recruitment of neutrophils involved in local inflammatory processes. Some authors have reported that regulatory cytokine expression profiles were found in probiotic bacteria, affording gastrointestinal disease protection to mice (Silva 2004; Alvim et al. 2016), while others have reported that the ideal was that the tested bacterial strain induced the expression of both regulatory cytokines (TGF\u2010\u03b2 and IL\u201010) as inflammatory cytokines (IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u201012, IL\u201017), contributing to an adequate balance between the two types of immune response (Galdeano and Perdig\u00f3n 2004; Steinberg et al. 2014). There have been many studies showing probiotic strains that induce the expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, and that are capable of inhibiting viral replication and protecting animals against viral infections, such as the Lactobacillus casei Shirota strain, which protects against influenza viruses and is widely used in fermented milk for human consumption (Hori et al. 2001). Tanabe et al. (2014) showed that a mix of five horse probiotics, consisting of Lactobacillus ruminis, Lact. equi, Lact. reuteri, Lactobacillus johnsonii and Bifidobacterium boum, regulated intestinal function and contributed to diarrhoea prevention in neonatal Thoroughbreds. However, other studies have shown that the introduction of live, beneficial micro\u2010organisms orally into the animal gut yielded variable results, with limited potential for therapeutic modification of foals\u2019 gastrointestinal microbiota and even adverse effects noted, with animals becoming more likely to develop diarrhoea requiring veterinary intervention (Schoster et al. 2016, 2015). Data in the literature have also reported the use of LAB that induced an inflammatory response to immune adjuvants in influenza, polio, rotavirus and cholera vaccines (Paineau et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2008; Davidson et al. 2011).",

Nevertheless, it did not show resistance to antimicrobials that were not intrinsically encoded on LAB. Analysis of the cytokine mRNA expression induced by treatment with Ped. pentosaceus revealed an inflammatory cytokine pattern, with significant increases in IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 gene expressions. On day 10 post\u2010Pp40 inoculation, mRNA levels of TNFa and IFNg were higher in the treated group than in the control group. Probably, this inflammatory scenario in the intestine was responsible for increasing the gut permeability and in consequence, facilitating the Salmonella infection. However, based on data in the literature, it is possible that the Ped. pentosaceus strain could work as adjuvant immune or check front protection against important viral infections in horses, such as diarrhoea in foals caused by Rotavirus or Coronavirus, or respiratory or systemic infections, such as equine influenza, equine viral arthritis and equine viral encephalitis. However, in an experimental mouse infection with Salm. Typhimurium, previous treatment for 10 days with Ped. pentosaceus 40 was prejudicial to the animals, accelerating the infection rate and the number of deaths. Thus, the health claims for a probiotic strain should be firstly established in in vivo experimental models that provide evidence of the strain's efficacy and then precisely labelled in the final probiotic products.",
