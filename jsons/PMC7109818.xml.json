The first laboratory used an ELISA based on a protocol and using antigens provided by Tom Ksiazek (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) [1]. Samples found to be positive for SARS by ELISA were confirmed by use of an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The second test was done at the National Environmental Agency, Singapore, and used a dot-blot immunoassay using antigens derived from virus culture supernatant. Positive samples, at a titer of \u2a7e1:100, were then subjected to a virus neutralization assay, in serial 2-fold dilution, starting at 1:10\u20131:320 and using amicroneutralization format described elsewhere for human enterovirus 71 [13]. A neutralizing antibody titer of \u2a7e10 was considered to be positive for SARS. Serum samples from volunteer patients with SARS and from nonexposed laboratory staff were included in all serologic assays as positive and negative controls, respectively. Thus, all the serum samples were tested by use of 2 screening tests (i.e., ELISA and dot-blot immunoassay), and the positive serum samples were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay and virus neutralization assay, respectively. Results of the serologic testing from each laboratory were not revealed to the other laboratory until after completion of the study.",

All of these patients had positive antibodies to the SARS coronavirus. Six of the 7 tested also had SARS coronavirus isolated from stool samples, blood samples, and/or respiratory secretions. These 21 patients stayed in NUH a mean \u00b1 SD of 3.9 \u00b1 4.8 days from admission or onset of symptoms to transfer to TTSH. There were 14 known nosocomial transmissions to staff members, visitors, and other patients, all of whom were eventually transferred to TTSH for treatment; 11 of these were linked to a single atypical case [15]. Initial policies on the use of PPE for HCWs, instituted on 17 March 2003, confined the mandatory use of gloves, gowns, and N95 masks to isolation wards only but, by 28 March, were extended to include intensive-care units and the emergency department. On 9 April, after the identification of an atypical case of SARS in an open general medical ward, full use of PPE was made mandatory for all staff in contact with patients.",

One hundred twelve (30.1%) worked in areas where patients with SARS had been cared for (i.e., the exposed group), and the rest had no exposure at all to patients with SARS (i.e., the nonexposed group). The characteristics of the HCWs are listed in table 1. The exposed group was younger and included more nurses, probably because of a higher representation of emergency department and intensive-care unit staff members in this group. A large number of staff members reported a variety of symptoms during the study period, including fever (n = 63 [16.9%]), cough (n = 69 [18.5%]), and diarrhea (n = 22 [5.9%]). There was a significant difference in the frequency of fever between exposed (28.6%) and nonexposed (11.9%) HCWs (P = .0001). Twenty-one HCWs (5.6%) in our study cohort were hospitalized during this period, of whom 6 were classified by clinical criteria as probably infected with SARS. Twenty-one (5.6%) of the participants or their spouses had traveled to other SARS-affected areas during the study period.",

Both samples tested for each HCW were found to be positive for all 8 HCWs, and no increase in titer could be demonstrated on their paired samples, since, from all 8 subjects, samples were obtained >4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. All 6 HCWs hospitalized at TTSH (including 5 who were first treated in our hospital) for probable SARS infection were found to be seropositive, and 2 additional individuals who had fever but did not meet SARS criteria (i.e., had symptoms <4 days in duration and had no changes on chest radiographs) were also seropositive. On the basis of data submitted anonymously for the study, as well as a review of hospital epidemiology and contact-tracing data, a profile of these 2 individuals could be constructed without compromising confidentiality: both worked in the emergency department at a time when patients with SARS were being treated in the department, wore full PPE, and did not have direct personal contact with any patients with SARS. One was admitted to an isolation room with fever, chills, and myalgias, which resolved completely within 3 days of symptomatic treatment; she had no changes on serial chest radiographs. The other was treated as an outpatient in the staff clinic; she presented with fever and upper respiratory symptoms. Again, chest radiographs were normal, and symptoms resolved within 3 days. No secondary cases resulted from any of the infected HCWs. No HCW who was completely asymptomatic was found by serologic testing to have SARS-associated coronaviral infection. It is interesting to note that, even after removing these 8 seropositve HCWs from the exposed and febrile groups in table 1, the difference between the exposed and nonexposed groups, in relation to being febrile, remains statistically significant (23.1% vs. 11.9%; P = .0095).",

The vast majority of infections, with a few notable exceptions, have occurred in hospitals. As with all emerging infections, the clinical picture is only beginning to be described completely. The initial descriptions included atypical pneumonia that followed a prodrome with fever and myalgia [6\u20138] and that progressed almost universally to a severe respiratory illness, with a variety of changes on chest radiographs [17]. In approximately one-sixth of cases, this eventually progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death [18]. Later reports highlighted gastrointestinal symptoms as a major element of a large community outbreak of SARS that was thought to be linked to environmental contamination [19]. Atypical presentations have also been reported, but all of these eventually led to the typical pattern of progressive respiratory distress with frank changes on radiographs [9].",

The present study is the first to document SARS infection in HCWs with normal chest radiographs. Two of our seropositive HCWs had fever for <1 week and responded to symptomatic therapy for upper respiratory-tract infections. Their chest radiographs were repeatedly normal. Thus, they did not meet the clinical criteria for probable SARS infection. The possibility that our 2 individuals with mild illness were false positives is diminished by the fact that they were found to be positive on both assays, which were done by laboratory staff who were blinded to clinical data. That none of the nonexposed HCWs had evidence of infection and the unpublished reports that blood donors in a variety of settings had no serologic evidence of SARS support our hypothesis that these were indeed mild infections. Given our experience with other viral respiratory tract infections in which a spectrum of infections is the rule, the detection of mildly symptomatic infections is not surprising.",

This was not the experience of other investigators screening contacts of the Nipah virus or avian influenza, but those were retrospective serologic studies done some time after the outbreak, and mild clinical symptoms might not have been detected [11, 12]. Given the fact that the SARS coronavirus seems to be a completely novel pathogen with minimal genetic relatedness to other coronaviruses of humans and animals [20], it is perhaps not that surprising that it produced at least some clinical disease in all infected individuals with no preexisting cross-protective immunity. This is supported by our observation that, in our hospital, individuals who were exposed to patients with SARS had a significantly higher prevalence of fever.",

In such a setting, transmission is likely to occur on either environmental surfaces or the hands of other HCWs. However, our study strikingly shows the complete absence of transmission to individuals working in the same building but in different areas from locations where patients with SARS had been cared for. This also has implications, since it bears out our experience with the global epidemiology of SARS, in which, WHO global travel alerts notwithstanding, almost all transmissions in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Toronto, and Singapore and the majority in mainland China could be traced back to specific household or health-care settings. This should be taken into consideration in the event that SARS is detected again next winter, before widespread economic disruption is created by travel alerts and advisories.",

Although the majority of cases of SARS in Singapore did not lead to any secondary infections [5], it is reassuring that mildly symptomatic cases are hopefully associated with lower virus loads [19] and less likely trigger epidemics. These cases might, however, allow for a low level of transmission of the virus, which might remain \u201cbelow the radar\u201d if they are not actively sought. This has been a concern with the reemergence of SARS in Toronto after a period during which transmission was believed to have been halted [21].",
