To avoid patients going off and back on isolation, an early interval retesting protocol was developed in which patients were held on isolation and retested 24 hours after the first result if they were categorized with high probability for COVID-19. Infectious disease physicians designated each patient with high or low probability based on the following clinical criteria consistent with reported literature 7 : (1) exposure to SARS-CoV-2; (2) symptoms of COVID-19, including hypoxia, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, or fever; (3) leukopenia; (4) chest imaging; (5) lack of other explanatory diagnosis. Patients labeled with high probability who tested negative were held on isolation another 24 hours for retesting. Longer-interval retesting outside this protocol continued concurrently; providers could request retesting any time during the hospitalization.

In the meantime, COVID-19 diagnostic uncertainty remains problematic for infection control and occupational health efforts.
