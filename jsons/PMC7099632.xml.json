The WHO recommended chloroquine (CQ) and primaquine (PQ) combined therapy as first choice treatment protocol for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in CQ susceptible areas [2,3]. CQ is a 4-aminoquinoline derivative of quinine, and has been the most widely used antimalarial drug since 1946. This drug has effects as schizontocide and gametocide, and is metabolized by CYP450 isozymes 2C8, 3A4, 3A5 and, to a lesser extent, 2D6 [4\u20136]. The 8-aminoquinoline PQ, a quinine derivative, is an important gametocytocide and also is the unique effective drug against P. vivax and Plasmodium ovale hypnozoites. PQ is metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYPC19 isoforms in different extent to form diverse metabolites [7\u201310]. This drug could lead to severe hemolytic anemia in subjects with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and this condition needs to be investigated before PQ prescription in some populations [11].",

Twenty-nine patients (17.6%) use other medications in combination to CQ and PQ to treat malaria symptoms or pre-existing diseases. Sample collection and ancestry determination were previously described [20]. Patients were clinically examined and received the standard 1500 mg of CQ associated with 210 mg of PQ treatment in a short regimen as recommended by the Brazilian health authorities [21]. The therapeutic regimen was administered as CQ 600 mg and PQ 30 mg in the first day, followed by CQ 450 mg and PQ 30 mg in the second and third days, and PQ 30 mg in the last 4 days to all patients included in the study. This schedule was used because according to the Brazilian health authorities a shorter treatment time facilitates treatment adhesion in isolated Amazonian regions.",

Patients were followed at the Evandro Chagas Institute for 6 months to identify relapse episodes. This follow-up time is the expected period in which relapses are expected to occur in the Amazonian region [23]. Patients were only considered with relapses if they presented malaria symptoms again and reside in urban areas with no risk of malaria transmission and did not travel to endemic areas. The incidence of malarial infections in the Brazilian Amazonian region was estimated as 6.3/1000 inhabitants. However, the transmission rate is variable in different localities. Usually it is higher in gold-digging areas and lower or absent in urban areas [19].",

Deviation from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium was assessed by Qui-square tests with Bonferroni correction. The individual proportions of European, African and Amerindian genetic ancestry were estimated using the STRUCTURE software 2.3.3 [26,27]. Analyses of the effect of different genotypes on the efficacy of the treatment were performed using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) to determine the genetic influence in parasitemia or gametocytemia clearance over time. GEE is a repeated measure analysis focused on average changes in response over time and the impact of covariates on these changes. This method models the mean response as a linear function of covariates of interest via a transformation or link function and can be used in studies in which data are asymmetric or the distribution of data is difficult to verify due to small sample size [28]. GEE was performed considering a Gaussian distribution with an identity link function and an exchangeable correlation matrix structure in SPSS18.0 (IBM company) statistical package for Windows\u00ae (IL, USA). Parasitemia and gametocytemia levels were log-transformed before analysis because of their asymmetric distribution, but untransformed data are shown in \u2018Figures\u2019 and \u2018Tables\u2019. Age, gender, co-medication, parasitemia baseline level, gametocytemia baseline level and genetic ancestry entered in models as covariates based on conceptual analyses of the literature and/or by means of a statistical definition (association with the study factor and with the outcome at p \u2264 0.15). Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was performed and corrected p-values were presented. Cohen's d-test was calculated to determine the effect sizes based on standardized differences between the means, that is, the difference between the means of the two conditions in terms of standard (z) scores [29]. Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed p < 0.05.",

CYP2C8 is mainly expressed in the liver and metabolizes near 5% of drugs cleared by Phase I reactions, while CYP2C9, that is also an abundant enzyme expressed in the liver, metabolizes approximately 15% of clinical drugs [32\u201335]. In the present study, CYP2C8-reduced activity alleles carriers showed lower rates of gametocyte elimination as compared with homozygous wild-type allele *1A. CYP2C8*4 is a missense mutation, which promotes a lower enzyme activity in vitro than the wild-type allele *1A, and similarly CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3 also present a markedly decrease activity in vitro [36,37]. In Africa, CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3 were associated with impaired metabolism of the antimalarial amodiaquine while CYP2C8*4 was not identified [38]. CYP2C9-reduced activity allele carriers also showed a lower gametocytemia clearance rate during treatment period, although not significant after Bonferroni correction. CYP2C9 was not related to CQ or PQ metabolism, however, linkage disequilibrium between CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 alleles was already reported in the admixed Brazilian population where those genes constitute a haplotypic block [39]. Linkage disequilibrium or an overlap of these enzyme functions are possible explanations for the trend observed in CQ/PQ treatment outcome. The lower rate of gametocyte elimination by CYP2C8*2/*3/*4 allele carriers observed herein indicates a slow response to treatment. CQ has a major effect as schizontocides in erythrocytes, but is also effective against P. vivax gametocytes. PQ has major effect as gametocytocide and hypnozoitocide in liver and is not metabolized by those CYPs isoenzymes. Besides CYP2C8 alleles were associated with slow gametocytemia clearance in CQ/PQ-associated regimen, the effect of PQ probably was sufficient to reach an adequate gametocyte clearance for all patients after 4 days of treatment. The synergistic effect of both drugs could prevent an ineffective response to treatment.",
