Methods: Both upper and lower respiratory specimens were collected for the analysis from all the patients who visited the Sheikh Khalifa Specialty Hospital (SKSH) with ARI for over 2 years. The multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test was used to detect respiratory viruses, which include human adenovirus, influenza virus (FLU) A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus, human enterovirus, human coronavirus, and human bocavirus. Results: A total of 1,362 respiratory samples were collected from 733 (53.8%) male and 629 (46.2%) female patients with ARI who visited the SKSH between November 2015 and February 2018. The rRT-PCR test revealed an overall positivity rate of 37.2% (507/1362). The positive rate increased during winter; it was highest in December and lowest in September. FLU was the most frequently detected virus (273/1362 [20.0%]), followed by human rhinovirus (146/1362 [10.7%]). The FLU positivity rate showed two peaks, which occurred in August and December. The peakto-low ratio for FLU was 2.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.52-3.35). Conclusions: The pattern of FLU in the UAE parallels to that of temperate countries. The trend of the small peak of FLU in the summer suggests a possibility of semiseasonal pattern in the UAE.

Of these patients, 1346 (98.8%) visited the emergency department and 16 (1.2%) visited the outpatient department. The numbers of cases in the pediatric, adult, and elderly groups were 198 (14.5%), 718 (52.7%), and 446 (32.8), respectively (Table 1). The median age was 5.0 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.0-7.0), 40.0 years (95% CI: 38.0-41.0), and 77.0 years (95% CI: 75.0-78.0) for the pediatric, adult, and elderly groups. A nasopharyngeal swab was the most frequently used method for specimen collection (1316 specimens [96.6%]). A total of 46 specimens were taken by sputum collection and bronchoalveolar lavage. A total of 386 (28.5%) patients with ARI were admitted, regardless of whether the presence of any respiratory virus had been confirmed.
