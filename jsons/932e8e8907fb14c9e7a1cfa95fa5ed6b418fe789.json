Oxidative stress is a physiological condition in which the production of damaging free radicals exceeds the in vivo capacity of antioxidant protection mechanisms to prevent pathophysiology. Free radicals are molecules with unpaired electrons, which are often highly reactive and damaging to biological systems. The biological membranes of subcellular organelles are major sites for free radical damage but proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are also significant targets. Moreover, free radicals can alter cellular signal-transduction pathways and stimulate the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines (7-9). Oxygen radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) arise from the single electron reductions of oxygen. ",

This chapter, however, focuses on the potential therapeutic uses of antioxidant liposomes. This is a rapidly evolving area of medical research that has not been extensively reviewed. Most of the research to date has been accomplished using in vitro cell culture systems or animal models. Very few clinical trials have been attempted, yet obvious medical situations exist (e.g., protection against influenza infection and adult respiratory distress syndrome as discussed later) in which antioxidant liposomes have enormous health-related significance. The preparation of antioxidant liposomes that can be targeted to specific sites in the body is also a promising area but awaits further research. Most chemical antioxidants are phytoceuticals whose properties have already been extensively studied and are generally regarded as nontoxic and safe for human consumption (24).",

Indeed, Chen and Djuric (41) found that carotenoid-containing liposomes were very sensitive to degradation by free radicals generated from iron and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride but were not protective against lipid peroxidation. \u03b2-Carotene at 0.45 mol% (of phospholipid) is, however, a more powerful inhibitor of singlet oxygen-mediated lipid peroxidation than \u03b1-TOH at 0.45 mol% (42). \u03b1-TOH at 4.5M is, however, also effective at inhibiting both free radical lipid peroxidation as well as singlet oxygen mediated lipid peroxidation (42).

Dihydrolipoic acid is somewhat unique because it can quench peroxyl radicals generated both in the aqueous phase and in membranes (50). Chemical antioxidants gener-ally act by donating an electron to a free radical (thereby quenching the free radical) or by serving as a substrate for an antioxidant enzyme. Glutathione, for example, is itself an antioxidant (12) and can also function as a substrate for glutathione peroxidase, a key (selenium-containing) antioxidant enzyme that converts lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs) or H 2 O 2 into the corresponding lipid alcohols (LOHs) or H 2 O. Chemical antioxidants can also be chelators of transition metal ions that catalyze lipid peroxidation reactions. Urate, which is present at very high concentrations in human plasma, is an excellent antioxidant that can both chelate transition metal ions and also quench aqueous free radicals (51-53).",

The intravenous use of antioxidant liposomes has the potential for rapidly increasing the plasma and tissue concentration of antioxidants far beyond what oral administration could achieve. Moreover, the proteolytic and bioselective processes of the gastrointestinal tract do not limit the types of antioxidants that can be administered via intravenous antioxidant liposomes. For example, it is known that plasma levels of \u03b1-TOH are about 10 times higher than the levels of \u03b3-TOH despite the fact that dietary levels of \u03b3-TOH are at least two times that of \u03b1-TOH. Nevertheless, \u03b3-TOH has a unique chemical ability to detoxify peroxynitrite that is not shared with \u03b1-TOH (61). Peroxynitrite is a powerful oxidant formed by the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide radicals (see Eq. 5) and may be an important mediator of acute oxidant tissue damage. It is reasonable to suspect, therefore, that medical situations could arise in which it would be desirable to rapidly increase plasma (and tissue) levels of \u03b3-TOH.

Stealth technology employs liposomes with a polymer coating of polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG liposomes). Recently, the preparation of pH-sensitive stealth liposomes has been described (68). These liposomes have a prolonged circulation in vivo and destabilize at mildly acidic pH thereby being particularly efficient at delivering a water-soluble compound into a cell's cytoplasm. The use of stealth antioxidant liposomes is very new with an increasing commercial interest in their potential therapeutic applications. Corvo et al. (69) have studied the practical aspects of subcutaneous SOD-PEG liposomal delivery with the aim of maximizing their therapeutic activity in a rat model of chronic arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease affecting the joints and involving the generation of damaging ROS. Antioxidants have, therefore, been proposed as potential therapeutic agents (70). Liposome size was found be the most important factor influencing the rate and extent of drainage of liposomes from the subcutaneous injection site as well as uptake by an arthritic site. Small-sized SOD-PEG liposomes(110 nm) were much more effective at targeting the arthritic site than large-sized SOD-PEG-liposomes (450 nm) (70).",

Surfactant is necessary to maintain proper expansion of the small air sacs in the lungs. If surfactant levels are low, the small air sacs in the lungs collapse resulting in poor oxygen delivery (hypoxia) to tissues. Infants deficient in surfactant therefore require treatment with high levels of oxygen to prevent damage to their vital organs. Unfortunately, premature infants are often deficient in antioxidants that are necessary to protect organs from injury caused by high concentrations of oxygen. The combination of surfactant deficiency and the presence of oxygen free radicals promote the development of chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD). BPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. An estimated 50% of all neonatal deaths result from BPD or its complications. In the adult form of respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine are recognized for their role in reducing the duration of acute lung injury (100,101) . The rationale for using antioxidant liposomes to treat respiratory distress in premature infants or adults is certainly compelling and supported by the animal models detailed below.

These authors point out that the delivery of drugs to the lung via liposomes is particularly useful because it can minimize extrapulmonary side effects and potentially result in increased drug retention time. In addition (as discussed previously), liposomes for delivery by inhalation or instillation can encapsulate enzyme and/or chemical substances that cannot be delivered by an oral route. Smith and Anderson (103) demonstrated that intratracheally administered liposomes (with phosphatidyl choline, cholesterol, and stearylamine) have a long retention time (more than 5 d) in the mouse lung. Liposomes with entrapped Cu,Zn SOD and CAT (Cu,ZnSOD + CAT) liposomes were intratracheally instilled in rabbits and the alveolar distribution of the antioxidants measured after 4 and 24 h (104) . The results indicate that Cu1nSOD + CAT liposomes could increase both SOD and CAT activities in distal lung cells, including alveolar type I, alveolar type II cells, and macrophages. More recent studies by Walther et al. (105) have shown that intratracheal administration of CuZn-CAT liposomes to premature rabbits can increase the lung SOD activity and protect against hyperoxic lung injury. Moreover, intratracheal delivery of SOD liposomes or CAT liposomes does not down-regulate mRNA synthesis of these enzymes in the premature rabbit lung (106). Archer et al. (107) have made effective use of the isolated perfused rat lung to study the role of oxygen radicals in modulating pulmonary vascular tone. This group showed that the generation of oxygen radicals (from xanthine-xanthine oxidase) decreased pulmonary vascular presser response to alveolar hypoxia. Either pretreatment of the lung with desferrioxamine or a mixture of superoxide and CAT liposomes inhibited decreases in pulmonary vascular reactivity. SOD administered free in solution or combined with CAT in liposomes, increased the normoxic pulmonary arterial pressure and enhanced vascular reactivity to angio- tensin 11 and hypoxia (107) .",

(108) have shown that intravenous injection of SOD liposomes or CAT liposomes can increase (two-to fourfold) the lung-associated specific activity of these antioxidant enzymes and also provide resistance to oxygen injury. Intravenous injection of nonentrapped (i.e., free) SOD or CAT (in the absence or presence of control liposomes) neither increased the specific lung activities of these enzymes nor provided resistance to oxygen toxicity. Similarly, intratracheal administration of SOD liposomes or CAT liposomes (negatively charged and multilamellar) to rats resulted in a significant elevation of lung SOD or CAT activity as well as resistance to pulmonary oxygen toxicity (109). Bamard et al. (110) have demonstrated that instillation of cationic SOD + CAT liposomes in a rabbit model was effective in preventing the increase in pulmonary filtration coefficient (a sensitive index of microvascular permeability) owing to free-radical-initiated lung injury. Repair of lung injury was inhibited by inhalation of elevated oxygen concentrations. This is of particular importance to the preterm human infant who may be exposed to elevated oxygen concentrations for weeks or months that could result in the chronic pneumopathy known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Treatment with liposome-encapsulated SOD and CAT conferred protection against the cytotoxic effects of 50 and 95% oxygen (111, 112) and also protection against cell death (113). Briscoe et al. (114) have evaluated the delivery of SOD to cultured fetal rat pulmonary epithelial cells via pH-sensitive liposomes. A fivefold increase in cellular SOD activity was observed after incubating the cultured cells with the pH-sensitive SOD liposomes (114). Fetal pulmonary epithelial cells express a high affinity receptor for surfactant protein A (SP-A). This receptor can be used to target liposome delivery to these cells by incorporating SP-A during the preparation of the SOD liposomes (114,115) . The presence of SP-A in the SOD liposomes facilitates their uptake by pulmonary epithelial cells (114,115) .",

In this work, rats were treated with 100% oxygen for 8 d and also given daily intratracheal injections of the CAT liposomes (with 160 U of CAT) that prevented chronic lung toxicity. Liposomes encapsulated with SOD or with lower levels of CAT (50 or 70 U) did not prevent the chronic lung changes. SOD + CAT liposomes are also effective in protecting lung tissues from bleomycin-induced injury as evidenced by decreased levels of lipid peroxidation products (118).",

To improve both the targeting and intracellular delivery to endothelium, this investigator has used a strategy in which antioxidant enzymes are first conjugated with antibodies against endothelial antigens, such as ACE, or adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) or platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). Muzykantov reports that these immunoconjugates accumulate in the pulmonary vasculature of intact animals, enter endothelium, and increase antioxidant defense capacity (120). Moreover, the ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 immunoconjugates could potentially decrease inflammatory processes in the lung by decreasing the infiltration of leukocytes (120).",

It is not surprising, therefore, that various researchers have explored the potential role of antioxidant liposomes in preventing pulmonary damage during lung infections. Suntres et al. (121,122) have used lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injuries as a model in which to study the potential prophylactic role of antioxidant liposomes. This is a very reasonable model because Gram-negative bacteria have LPS as a component of their cell wall, and it is a potent stimulus for the generation of ROS and RNOS by phagocytic cells. LPS-induced lung injury is an excellent model for acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by sepsis. Suntres and Shek (121) found that pretreating Sprague-Dawley rats with \u03b1-TOH liposome, by intravenous administration, could significantly reduce LPS-induced lung injury. This group also found that liposome-entrapped dexamethasone was effective in preventing LPS-induced lung injury in rats (122).",

            "text": "Influenza is a viral disease that affects the respiratory tract. The three types of influenza viruses are designated A, B, and C, with the A and B types primarily being responsible for the yearly winter epidemics. The influenza viruses continually mutate over time causing antigenic drift, which can result in large populations of people being devoid of antibody protection. The resulting periodic pandemics can cause large numbers of deaths. For example, the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic resulted in the death of approx 20 million people worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that free radical production and lipid peroxidation play a major role in the damage caused by influenza in fection (123-125) . In particular, influenza infection is accompanied by an increase in the production of superoxide radicals and decrease in the activity of SOD that removes superoxide radicals (126). It has been suggested that the high production of ROS in the lung during influenza infection could inactivate protease inhibitors resulting in a damaging increase in protease activity (127). Administration of SOD has been found to be very effective in preventing mortality owing to influenza infection in animal models (128) . It has also been suggested that antioxidants along with protease inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of severe influenza infection (129). It is surprising, therefore, that antioxidant liposomes have not yet been used for the treatment of severe influenza infection. This is certainly an area requiring further investigation considering its enormous health-related significance. Also of interest is that the influenza virus causes apoptosis in macrophages that can be prevented by the antioxidants NAC or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (130). Liposomes are readily phagocytized by macrophages, and hence this cell type is a natural target for antioxidant liposomes. Similarly, antioxidant liposomes are very likely to be effective in ameliorating the pathophysiology associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by an atypical coronavirus. SARS has an extremely high mortality rate (currently up to 15-19%) and has expanded to over 25 countries. ",
