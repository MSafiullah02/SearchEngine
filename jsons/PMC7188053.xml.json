The study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with a written protocol approved by the institutional review board for each participating center. The study was completed as planned. Postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years with an average of 7 to 20 moderate to severe hot flashes per day (as recorded in a 2-week patient-reported baseline diary), <50% change in average daily frequency between the first and second weeks of the baseline diary, and no active ongoing health condition that could have caused difficulty in interpreting hot flash symptoms were enrolled at three clinical research units in the United States. Menopause was defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy, with or without hysterectomy. Participants were required to discontinue any medications that may have affected the number or severity of hot flashes or which may have interacted pharmacokinetically with NT-814 before the start of the baseline period and were not permitted to take these medications at any time during the study. All participants provided written informed consent.",

The apparent advantage of placebo over the 50 mg dose is not present when median values are examined perhaps reflecting the small size of each treatment group in this early study of NT-814. At the higher end of the dose\u2013response curve, the mean changes from baseline indicated that the 150 mg dose achieved a better effect than a 300 mg dose. This advantage is again not as apparent in the median values, and the exposure response modeling showed that once plasma concentrations of NT-814 equating to those achieved with a 150 mg dose are reached there is a plateau effect.",

            "text": "These findings further support modulation of NK receptors as a mechanism for treatment for hot flash and other menopause-related symptoms. The hypertrophy of hypothalamic KNDy neurons in postmenopausal women (with elevated gene expression levels of kisspeptin, NKB, and SP)17-22 are a consequence of estrogen withdrawal; in cynomolgus monkeys these features can be induced by oophorectomy and reversed by estrogen replacement.32-34 KNDy neurons branch extensively within the infundibular nucleus and are linked to the medial preoptic nucleus, which has been identified as the estrogen-sensitive thermoregulation control center.23,35 It is hypothesized that after menopause KNDy neurons are in a hyperactive state (consistent with the observed hypertrophy) that disrupts thermoregulation and triggers hot flashes.23 This hypothesis is supported by clinical studies with other NK3 receptor antagonists that showed NK3 receptor blockade rapidly reduces both the number and the severity of hot flashes.14,15,25,26 Additionally, a genome-wide association study demonstrated that NK3 receptor gene variation may influence hot flash risk.36 Hot flashes are also a symptom of carcinoid syndrome, in which SP levels are elevated.37 Although NK1 antagonism alone appears to be ineffective for hot flashes,38 Phase 2 studies have shown efficacy for NK1 receptor antagonists in mood39-41and primary insomnia,42 so a compound such as NT-814 that also has NK1 antagonist properties may also improve sleep and other comorbidities associated with menopausal symptoms.",

However, the relatively stringent selection criteria may have resulted in a less generalizable study population. Limitations of the study are the small group sizes and short duration, although both were sufficient to enable a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of NT-814 as a treatment for postmenopausal hot flashes to be made before progressing to larger and longer studies. Although diary recording of hot flash symptoms is the standard method for symptom assessment, it shares the limitations of other patient-reported outcome assessments. These assessments are subjective and, despite randomization and blinding, placebo responses of 50% or more are common.43,44 In RELENT-1, participants taking placebo had improvements of 37% in mean hot flash frequency and 15% in mean severity in the second week of treatment. On the basis of the results of this small, short duration study, further evaluation of NT-814 efficacy in women with bothersome menopausal hot flashes was considered appropriate, and a Phase 2b study evaluating a range of doses for 12 weeks of treatment in approximately 200 women is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03596762).",

The effect at these doses was immediate, beginning in the first week of treatment, and also sustained, improving symptoms more in the second week of treatment than in the first. Lower doses (50 mg and 100 mg once daily) were not effective. No safety concerns were identified for NT-814. Doses up to 300 mg were well tolerated. Most adverse events were mild. The most common adverse events were headache and somnolence that was intermittent and limited in duration. The findings from the evaluation of this nonhormone dual NK1 and NK3 receptor antagonist support both modulation of NK receptors as a treatment for hot flashes and other menopause-related symptoms and the further assessment of NT-814 as a potential therapy for treating these symptoms.",
