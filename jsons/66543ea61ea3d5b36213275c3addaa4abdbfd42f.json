Nowadays, asthma is regarded as a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways instead of solely a reversible airway obstruction. Asthma is often diagnosed on specific symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and coughing. It is likely that, rather than a single disease entity, asthma consists of related, partially overlapping syndromes. The first symptoms often are experienced before the age of 5. Children with the highest risk have a family history of atopy and/or asthma. Viral infections with symptoms of wheezing acquired in the first year of life may be associated with the risk of developing asthma later on [1] . However, making the diagnosis with a reasonable certainty that is supported by spirometry is only possible from the age of 6 onward. More than 50% of children with a period of wheezing earlier on in life are not diagnosed as having asthma at the age of 6 [2] .",

To reliably assess influenza, the presence of influenza virus should coincide with symptomatic disease. However, in reports on the impact of influenza outbreaks, proxy measures are often used, such as isolated serologic incidence rates, rates of influenza like illness, and complications. Seasonal incidence measured in that way varies from 0-48% [9] . But for discussing the overall impact of influenza and protective measures such as vaccination, one should obviously use an average incidence. The best estimates for an average incidence come from two prospective long-term open population studies. Reported incidences are 4.6% (children aged 0-19 years) respectively 9.5% (children aged 0-5 years) [9] [10] [11] .

Studies in asthmatic children report varying incidences, suggesting that between 30 and 80% of exacerbations are due to a virus [13] [14] [15] .

Over the past years, live attenuated vaccines have been developed, tested, and used for intranasal administration. The less invasive route, of course, is a benefit in administering the vaccine. Besides, there is hope that the induced mucosal IgA immune response will provide a better protection against infection. In a large multicenter trial, a direct comparison between intramuscular inactivated and intranasal live attenuated vaccine in children with asthma [26] was made in which the live attenuated vaccine was 53% more efficacious in preventing influenza infection. However, as the authors correctly state, because there was no placebo group, the absolute efficacy cannot be calculated. A systematic review indicates that vaccines can have an efficacy of 65% for TIV and 79% for CAIV in reducing serologically confirmed cases of influenza in healthy children, i.e., by comparing pre and postseason antibody titers. However, when using symptombased outcomes, i.e., influenza-related disease, the vaccines showed an efficacy of only 28% for inactivated and 38% for live attenuated vaccine [30] . Moreover, in case of a mismatch between the vaccine composition and the natural virus, efficacy probably will be much lower or absent.",

Regarding vaccination, CAIV seems to be an improvement, although it still has to be delivered yearly, a huge logistic operation. Future research into influenza vaccination will understandably be focussed on broad-spectrum and long-lasting vaccines. If this goal is ever reached, it will make preventing influenza infections much easier.",
