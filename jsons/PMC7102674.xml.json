            "text": "Advances in analytical techniques to explore global proteome changes have found increasing use in host\u2013pathogen interaction studies in infections [1], [2]. Conventional gel-based systems for the purpose use a two-dimensional protein electrophoresis followed by protein identification by mass spectrometry. The newer shotgun proteomics methods have greatly enhanced the spatiotemporal resolution of proteome identification compared to these conventional methods and use liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) [3]. However, irrespective of these advances, the cross-platform consistency of many proteomics studies in repeatedly identifying the same set of proteins has been rather low, even for identical disease conditions [4]. Variations in experimental design or adopted methodologies can be attributed for these discrepancies. Nevertheless, this has necessitated a comparative approach of multiple studies to reach a meaningful conclusion of the molecules and pathways reliably linked to the pathological process. The present study describes the use of such an approach for understanding the cellular infection process by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a recently re-emerged pathogen.",

These include studies using cell lines like CHME-5, a microglial cell [9], WRL-68, a human hepatic fetal epithelial cell line [10] and SJCRH30, a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line [11], and those in patient serum [12], in white blood cells isolated from Chikungunya fever patients [13] and in experimentally infected mice tissues such as the liver, brain and muscle [14], [15], [16].

The second dimension separation was performed on a 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 mm BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm particle size column (Waters), with 1\u201340% B, for a 30 minute gradient at 0.3 \u03bcl/min flow rate. After separation, the column was washed with 85% mobile phase B for 4 min and re-equilibrated with 1% mobile phase B for 14 min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 \u00b0C.",

To minimize unintended ion activation each of the preceding voltages was chosen to run as low as possible while facilitating ion transmission. The traveling wave height was ramped over 100% of the IMS cycle between 8 and 20 V. The time of flight analyzer (TOF) was calibrated with a solution of glu-fibrinopeptide B (500 fmol/\u03bcl) and the lock mass acquisition was done every 30 s by the same peptide delivered through the reference sprayer of the NanoLockSpray source at a flow rate of 500 nl/min. This calibration set the analyzer to detect ions up to 2000 \nm/z. The radio frequency (RF) generator supplying the quadrupole allowed isolation of ions up to 2400 \nm/z. Full mass spectra were acquired with a trap CE of 4 V. For mass-to-charge selected ions (in resolving quad-mode) LM resolution was set to 4.7, and HM resolution to 15.0 with the quadrupole set to isolate the m/z of interest.

The increase in macromolecular synthesis for the generation of viral components also trigger synthesis of host factors that promote cell sustenance and survival resulting in an overall increase in the host cell biosynthetic activity [22]. Earlier studies in Sindbis virus infection, the prototype Alphavirus, have identified modulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics to favor ATP synthesis that is required to support active viral replication [23]. Similarly, in our study we see that the mitochondrial proteins are regulated during CHIKV infection in the HEK293 cell line. Most of the enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism like gluconeogenesis and glycolysis leading to the citric acid cycle are modulated upon infection. All the products of nutrient catabolism are fed to the central pathway of citric acid cycle by the formation of acetylCoA. Modulation of several key enzymes in this pathway indicates that the CHIKV infection regulates the oxidative phosphorylation leading to ATP synthesis by the electron transport chain.",

The enveloped viruses in general stimulate increased fatty-acid metabolism for generation of membranes from which the envelopes can be derived [24]. Apart from this, CHIKV infection also regulates the expression of several enzymes in the amino-acid metabolism which have a role in both transamination and deamination processes.",

            "text": "The cellular ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway (UPP) is an important protein degradation pathway that plays a crucial role in the regulation of many fundamental cellular functions. Many positive-sense RNA viruses use this pathway to eliminate excess viral proteins that prevent viral replication [25]. The proteasome is a multi-catalytic proteinase complex that has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity and is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu. The cytosolic 26S proteasome has one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. We found the modulation of several proteasomal proteins as a key component in CHIKV infected cells. Also, there was modulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes that catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. These observations strongly suggest that the CHIKV infection activates the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway (UPP) leading to protein degradation. The increase in the UPP thus helps in selectively eliminating the abnormally folded or damaged proteins produced during infection. Similar observations on the requirement of the components of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system have been shown for the maturation and release of a number of viruses [26]. Proteomics studies have also shown the functional role of UPP in infection by many viruses such as Dengue virus [27], Hepatitis B virus [28] and Japanese encephalitis virus [29].",

In CHIKV infection, activation of the cellular protein, protein kinase R (PKR), plays a role in the inhibition of host protein synthesis [40]. Also, similar to other Alphaviruses, nsP2 induces a cellular shut-off that blunts the host antiviral response and finally kills infected cells [41]. The cellular shut-off is a multi-step process in which several components are regulated. One of the key steps is post-transcriptional modification, like splicing. This splicing mechanism is done by spliceosome which is assembled from snRNPs and protein complexes. Several proteins that play a role in splicing machinery are up-regulated in CHIKV infected cells. Modulation of the spliceosome assembly and regulation were also detected in other viral infections like Herpes simplex virus in proteomic analysis [42]. Also, several tRNA synthetases are up-regulated during CHIKV infected HEK293 cells as shown in other viral infections [36,43]. CHIKV infection also led to the up-regulation of some of the ribosomal proteins that are involved in the translational machinery. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (EIF4B) and its binding protein EIF4EBP1 are important in cellular mRNA translation and play a role in mTOR signaling pathway in the apoptotic processes. Hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in other viral infections such as in African Swine Fever Virus infection has been reported [44]. Both these proteins are up-regulated in CHIKV infected cells.",

            "text": "Nucleolin, another protein involved in the rRNA and ribosomes biogenesis, is seen up-regulated in HEK cells and also in CHME cells [9]. The transcript level of nucleolin also showed up-regulation at 12 h of post-infection (Fig. 5). It is a protein widely seen in nucleolus and is seen to be involved in virus replication in many viral infections [54]. It is also thought to be important in the nuclear egress of viral particles like HSV type I [55] and entry of human parainfluenza virus in A549 cells [56]. Nucleolin interacts with the viral proteins like NS5B of Hepatitis B virus [57] and capsid protein of Dengue [58]. It acts as a cellular receptor for human Respiratory Syncytial Virus [59]. Cyclophilin A (PPIA) is a protein with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and acts as a chaperone in protein folding mechanism. PPIA is important in viral infections like HIV, influenza A virus, SARS coronavirus, vaccinia virus, rotavirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and HCMV and HCV infection, and may serve to play a critical role in the life cycle of viruses [49], [50]. In our proteomics study, we could find that PPIA is up-regulated while it is down-regulated in WRL-68 cells. Similarly, we could also find a significant transcript level modulation of PPIA mRNA 12 h post-infection in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5).",

It was originally identified as a human histone chaperone which activates chromatin transcription in an acetylation dependent manner, and was found to be important in host\u2013virus interaction, especially in HIV infection and HBV infection [51], [52]. It is a multifunctional protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis [53]. Interestingly in earlier studies on CHIKV proteomics, this protein was found to be up-regulated at cellular level in both WRL-68 cells and SJCRH30 cells [10], [11]. In our study, the modulation of NPMI in HEK293 cells was prominently visible at 48 h p.i. as a speckle formation in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 6a & b). The aggregation of these proteins could be because of its interaction with viral proteins or with other cellular proteins, which is an interesting lead for further investigation.",

Interestingly, all these pathways were documented in earlier proteomics studies done in CHIKV infection. Further, a comparative analysis of the results from our study and earlier studies identified 30 proteins that were consistently modulated in all the studies. Preliminary analysis indicates that the nuclear chaperone, Nucleophosmin, might be a player in CHIKV infection also, as seen in certain other viral infections in earlier studies [51], [52].
