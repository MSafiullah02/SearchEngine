Although proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and small molecules form the major constituents of human cell, the last decade has evidenced considerable progress in the study of glycans on human cells and their role in cell-cell interaction, signaling, host-pathogen interaction, and carbohydrates contributing to important biological functions in cells. Attached to lipids and proteins, carbohydrates comprise glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively, and play diverse myriads of roles in development, signaling, host-parasite interaction, and immune system in different organisms [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. The study of sialylation in bacteria is a relatively new domain which is of immense importance in understanding and targeting host-parasite interaction in infectious diseases.",

In Neu5Gc or N-glycolylneuraminic acid, the terminal sialic acid residue is linked by the hydroxy group of the glycolic acid unit, synthesized from Neu5Ac catalyzed by CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) hydroxylase (CMAH) in animals including lower animals [19], [20], [21], [22]. Nue5Gc is absent in humans as they lack CMAH gene. Oxygen and reduced pyridine nucleotide play vital roles in enzyme activity together with an effective cofactor NADH and the substrate CMPNeu5Ac, and are activated by cytochrome b5. Neu5Gc is expressed in extraneural tissues but very low, absent, or reveal suppressed expression in the vertebrate brain [21].",

The biological effect depends on the position relative to the 9\u2011carbon scaffold in Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc. The O-acetyl group being a more hydrophobic moiety when introduced into the sialic acid molecule the parameters like size, net charge, hydrogen bonding and conformation of glycoconjugate alters and the terminal location enables their involvement in different functions such as cell-cell adhesion, signaling, differentiation and metastasis [85], [86], [87], [88]. The extended nature of oligosaccharide chains, and possibly their negative charges, plays an important role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions [86]. O-acetylated sialic acids reported to occur in bacteria and parasites are known to act as receptor determinants for some viruses, well-known cancer markers in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and also regulate ganglioside-mediated apoptosis. Sialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferases and O-acetylesterases regulate their synthesis [89].",

This then converts to ManNAc by epomerization reaction, and finally to CMP-Neu5Ac [117], [118], [119], [121]. Neu5Ac is transferred to macromolecules from the nucleotide sugar, which can later be released into the lysosomes, and exported into the cytosol [122], [123].

The phosphate group of Neu5Ac9P emerges from ManNAc-6-P.(i)Deaminated neuraminic acid (KDN) although reported to occur in vertebrates and bacteria, is predominantly expressed in lower vertebrates. KDN is linked to most glycan structures in place of Neu5Ac and is found to occur as glycoconjugates, including glycolipids, glycoproteins, and capsular polysaccharides. They exhibit linage types such as \u03b12,3, \u03b12,4, \u03b12,6, and \u03b12,8 bearing similarity to Neu5Ac. KDN de novo biosynthesis involves mannose as a precursor, activated to CMP-KDN and transferred to acceptor sugar residues. Predominant KDN expression has been reported to occur in fetal human red blood cells and ovarian tumor tissues as compared to adult RBC and normal individuals. KDNase, which cleaves KDN linkages, is reported to occur in bacteria [133]. KDN could arise from sequential deacetylation and deamination of Neu5Ac.C8 acidic sugar 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo) is reported to occur in Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and plant cell pectic rhamnogalacturonan II. In the light of recent discoveries although hitherto unknown, sialic acid expression in algae Kdo has been reported. de novo biosynthesis of the deaminated sialic acid, 3-deoxy- d-glycero-d-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid (Kdn), has been reported to occur in Prymnesium parvum (P. parvum) with probable indications of role in host pathogen [134].(ii)Other types of substitutions of the hydroxyl groups arise from use of the appropriate donors such as S-adenosylmethionine for methylated sialic acids and 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulphate for sulfated molecules. However, not many studies have been done on other modifications like O-lactyl groups.Sialic acid family has now been designated as subclass of the superfamily of naturally occurring non-2-ulosonic acids (NulOs), the parent molecule of the family being neuraminic acid (Neu), which is not found in free form in nature due to its immediate cyclization to form an internal Schiff base, and is a nine\u2011carbon-containing monosaccharide, comprising 2-keto-carboxylic acid, a deoxysugar, and an aminosugar. Other members of the NulO superfamily include 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxynon-2-ulosonic acids, with the mother molecules pseudaminic acid (Pse), legionaminic acid (Leg), 4-epi-legionaminic acid (4eLeg), 8-epilegionaminic acid (8eLeg), acinetaminic acid (Aci), and 8-epi-acinetaminic acid (8eAci), found in bacterial polysaccharides and glycoproteins [5] (Fig. 6\n).\n",

Mucins of Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) or Teladorsagia circumcincta (T. circumcincta) parasites in sheep revealed fucose, glucosamine, galactose, and galactosamine and minute amounts of sialic acids [219]. Schistosoma bovis (S. bovis) a parasite of wild and domestic ruminants lack sialic acid expression but expressed complex-type N-glycans and immunogenic GalNAc\u03b21\u20134GlcNAc (LDN) terminate antennae on excretory-secretory (ES) glycoproteins [220].

Sialic acids were identified in the acidic fraction of glycolipids of E. granulosus metacestode tissue [221]. The altered glycosylation of intestinal mucins of mouse infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N. brasiliensis) revealed a transferase adding a terminal GalNAc to sialic acid-containing epitope in rat [223]. The sialylation of mucins during a 13-day infectious cycle in Sprague-Dawley rats infected with N. brasiliensis parasite revealed a relative decrease in Neu5Gc compared with Neu5Ac by decreased expression of a CMAH hydroxylase [224]. The removal of adult worms of parasite N. brasiliensis from the small intestinal goblet cell mucins of mice is hypothesized to be possibly associated with terminal GalNAc and sialic acid residues of the small intestinal goblet cell mucins prior to infection [225].",

Lectins were known to participate in immune recognition and host defense and Ch-salectin, a novel sialic acid-binding lectin, was reported to occur in Crassostrea hongkongensis (C. hongkongensis) with a role in immune recognition and host defense against bacterial infection caused by C. hongkongensis\n[239]. SABL from Manila clam Venerupis philippinarum, VpSABL [240], has been reported. A novel sialic acid-specific lectin (MCsialec) was detected from Manila clam hemocytes infected with Perkinsus olseni that plays a vital role during pathogenic infection [241]. Scalarin from the eggs of Pomacea canaliculata (P. canaliculata, Lamarck, 1822) and Pomacea scalaris (P. scalaris, d\u2019Orbigny, 1835) revealed expression of terminal sialic acid residues possibly resistant to neuraminidase and O-linked residues derived from the T and Tn antigens [242]. N-linked oligosaccharides are expressed in the nacreous layer of Japanese pearl oyster Pinctada fucata (P. fucata) [243]. A novel \u03b1/\u03b2-galactoside \u03b1-2,3-sialyltransferase was expressed by luminous marine bacterium, Photobacterium phosphoreum JT-ISH-467, isolated from the Japanese common squid (Todarodes pacificus, T. pacificus) [244]. Garden snail Cepaea hortensis (C. hortensis) [245], [246] has been reported to express sialic acid-specific lectin. C. hortensis agglutinin-I (CHA\u2014I) lectin binds to O-linked sialic acids [247]. Newly hatched Hawaiian squid Euprymna scolopes (E. scolopes) rapidly become colonized by the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri which exhibited the unusual ability to migrate to nucleosides, nucleotides, and sialic acid, a component of squid mucus [248]. Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc have been reported to occur in slug Arion lusitanicus (Gastropoda) revealing specificity toward MAA [249]. Eye lenses of common squid (T. pacificus) and Pacific octopus (Octopus vulgaris, O vulgaris) has been known to express gangliosides including gangliotetraose species and c-series gangliosides [250]. Acidic lipids from T. pacificus and O. vulgaris revealed expression of Neu5Ac. Lipid-bound sialic acid in cerebral ganglia were significantly lower as compared to the expression in hepatopancreatic tissues indicative of ganglioside expression in protostomia [167].",

After dephosphorylation by Sia-9-phosphate phosphatase, Sia is activated to CMP-Sia by CMP-Sia synthetase (CMAS) in the nucleus. CMP-Sia is transported into the Golgi apparatus and many sialyltransferases (STs), such as ST3, ST6, and ST8, transfer Sia residues onto the glycoproteins and glycolipids forming sialoglycoproteins and sialoglycolipids (gangliosides).",
