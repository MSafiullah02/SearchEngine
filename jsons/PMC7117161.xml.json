            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA viruses that can be divided into four genera: Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3-CoV), and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4-CoV) (Su et al., 2016). CoVs can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, or neurological diseases of varying severity in a variety of animals (Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017). Swine enteric CoV is one of the main causative pathogens of viral diarrhea in piglets. To date, at least four kinds of swine enteric CoVs have been identified, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and HKU2-like porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV). TGEV, PEDV and PEAV belong to the \u03b1-CoVs, while PDCoV is a member of the genus \u03b4-CoV (Pan et al., 2017; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Woo et al., 2012). Among the four swine enteric CoVs, TGEV was the first to be identified in the United States as early as 1946 (Doyle and Hutchings, 1946). PEDV was discovered in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and was subsequently identified in many European and Asian countries (Lee, 2015; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978). Since late 2010, variant PEDV strains have reemerged in China and have now become the dominant global strain (Huang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012). PDCoV was originally found in pig manure in Hong Kong in 2009, and the first outbreak was reported in 2014 in the United States (Wang et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2012). The newly identified PEAV is a bat-HUK2-like CoV in swine which was found in a diarrhea outbreak in swine herds in Guangdong, China in 2017 (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). All four swine enteric CoVs cause severe diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality in piglets, resulting in great economic losses and posing a continuing threat to the development of the pig industry.",

            "text": "Regarding in vitro culture of these four swine enteric CoVs, ST (swine testicle) and PK-15 (porcine kidney) cells are widely used for TGEV isolation and propagation (Ding et al., 2017); Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells are highly susceptible to PEDV and PEAV infection (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Pan et al., 2017); ST and LLC-PK1 (porcine kidney) cells are permissive for PDCoV infection (Hu et al., 2015). It is well known that porcine intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells in vivo for swine enteric CoVs. However, none of the cells mentioned above (Vero, ST, PK-15, and LLC-PK1) are derived from the porcine intestinal tract. Biological experiments with enteric CoVs on non-intestinal epithelial cells often do not mimic real infections and are unsuitable for studying cell-virus interactions. IPEC-J2 is a line of porcine intestinal epithelial cells derived from neonatal pig jejunum (Brosnahan and Brown, 2012). Some studies have shown that IPEC-J2 cells were susceptible to PEDV infection, while others reported the opposite (Zhang et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2014). However, a subclone of IPEC-J2 cells, IPEC-DQ, supports efficient PEDV propagation (Zhang et al., 2018). Recently, Jung et al. also tested the susceptibility of IPEC-J2 cells to PDCoV infection and found that IPEC-J2 cells supported PDCoV propagation but cytopathic effect (CPE) could only be observed after the 3rd serial passage of PDCoV in this cell type (Jung et al., 2018).",

However, whether IPI-2I cells are susceptible to swine enteric CoVs has not been characterized. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of IPI-2I cells to four different swine enteric CoVs and established a sub-cloned homogeneous cell population (designated IPI-FX), which can be efficiently infected by all four swine enteric CoVs.",

Before evaluating the susceptibility of IPI-2I cells to infection with these enteric CoVs, we examined the trypsin tolerance of IPI-2I cells. Monolayers of IPI-2I cells were treated with different concentrations (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 \u03bcg/ml) of trypsin and the results showed that the optimal concentration of trypsin added in IPI-2I cell culture medium was 2.5 \u03bcg/ml. We then investigated the susceptibility of IPI-2I cells to PDCoV infection under this trypsin concentration. As shown in Fig. 2\n, typical CPE, characterized by shrunken, rounded and clustered cells, was observed at 12\u201330 hpi in PDCoV-infected IPI-2I cells (Fig. 2A). Infection was also confirmed by IFA staining with mAb against PDCoV S protein (Fig. 2B). By comparing the growth curves of PDCoV in IPI-2I and LLC-PK1 cells (MOI = 0.1), the viral titers in IPI-2I cells were lower than those in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 2C).

They speculated that it was due to the non-homogeneity of IPEC-J2 cells. Thus, they sub-cloned IPEC-J2 cells by limited serial dilutions and obtained a homogeneous cell population (IPEC-DQ) that could support efficient and productive infection of PEDV (Zhang et al., 2018). Thus, we hypothesized that IPI-2I cells were likely to have heterogeneous characteristics similar to those of IPEC-J2 cells. We subcloned IPI-2I cells by limited serial dilutions as illustrated in Fig. 5\nA. A total of 24 sub-cloned homogeneous cell populations exhibited higher susceptibility to PEDV infection, as demonstrated by PEDV N protein-specific IFA (data not shown). A homogeneous cell population possessing higher infection efficiency, designated IPI-FX, was chosen for further experiments. As shown in Fig. 5B, typical CPE could be observed in IPI-FX cells infected with PEDV, and over 80% of cells could be infected, as demonstrated by IFA with mAb against PEDV N protein (Fig. 5B).

            "text": "Enteric CoVs are the main pathogens causing viral diarrhea in pigs. The primary target cells for swine enteric CoVs in vivo are villous epithelial cells of the intestinal tract. Thus, cell lines derived from primary porcine intestinal epithelial cells are the ideal cell models to study interactions between these swine enteric CoVs and the host in vitro. In this study, we characterized the susceptibility of porcine IPI-2I intestinal epithelial cells to infection with four different swine enteric CoVs. We found that IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV and PEAV. Although the non-homogeneous IPI-2I cells were not susceptible to PEDV, higher susceptibility could be achieved in IPI-FX, a homogeneous cell population obtained by sub-clone screening of the parental cell line.",

            "text": "Although IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to PDCoV and PEAV, the viral titers in the infected IPI-2I cells were lower than those in the commonly used susceptible cells, LLC-PK1 and Vero cells, respectively. We speculated that the lower trypsin tolerance of IPI-2I may account for the lower viral titers of PDCoV and PEAV. The maximum concentration of trypsin tolerated by IPI-2I cells was 2.5 \u03bcg/ml, while LLC-PK1 and Vero cells are highly resistant to trypsin, and 5\u201310 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin concentrations are usually used for PDCoV and PEAV infection (Dong et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2017). Previous studies have suggested that trypsin is crucial for cell membrane fusion and entry of swine enteric CoVs, and can mediate the membrane fusion activation of virions by lysis of glycoprotein spikes (Dong et al., 2016; Wicht et al., 2014). The higher viral titers of TGEV in infected IPI-2I cells compared with ST cells appears to support our speculations. There is no need for trypsin addition for TGEV proliferation, and the higher viral titers of TGEV in IPI-2I cells were achieved in the absence of exogenous trypsin. We also determined the viral titers of PDCoV and PEAV in LLC-PK1 and Vero cells, respectively, under the trypsin concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/ml, and found that similar viral titers could be achieved compared to those in IPI-2I cells (data not shown). The trypsin tolerance concentrations of IPI-FX cells were also measured and found that the same trypsin concentrations were tolerated by IPI-FX and IPI-2I cells. Work to obtain a homogeneous cell population with higher trypsin tolerance from IPI-FX cells is currently ongoing in our laboratory.",

            "text": "In this study, we found that PEDV can infect IPI-2I cells; however, only a few cells appeared to be PEDV-positive, which may be due to the heterogeneity of IPI-2I cells, because the homogeneous IPI-FX cells obtained by sub-cloning from IPI-2I cells were highly susceptible to PEDV infection. Likewise, the non-homogeneous IPEC-J2 cells exhibit lower susceptible to PEDV, while the homogeneous IPEC-DQ which was sub-cloned from IPEC-J2 cells by limited serial dilutions, can be readily infected by PEDV (Zhang et al., 2018). Recently, Jung et al. tested the susceptibility of IPEC-J2 to infection with PDCoV and found that viral RNA could be detected in the cell culture supernatant after two continuous passages in the IPEC-J2 cells supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin; however, no CPE was observed (Jung et al., 2018). By modifying the procedure of inoculation, that is, omitting the washing of cells after virus adsorption, the 4th passaged PDCoV in IPEC-J2 cells showed CPE characterized by enlarged, rounded and densely granular cells (Jung et al., 2018). In our present study, evident CPE could be observed in IPI-2I cells infected with the 1st passage of PDCoV, even when supplemented with only 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin in the cell culture medium. It appears that IPI-2I cells are more susceptible than IPEC-J2 cells to PDCoV infection. Based on the results that homogeneous IPEC-DQ from IPEC-J2 as well as IPI-FX from IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to PEDV, it is possible that homogeneous IPEC cell lines susceptible to PDCoV, and even to all four swine enteric CoVs, can be obtained by the sub-cloning method. This work has been conducted in our laboratory.",

            "text": "Clinically, co-infections in pigs by two or even three kinds of swine enteric CoVs often occur. For example, PEDV and TGEV co-infections are frequently detected in piglets with severe diarrhea, and recently a chimeric swine enteric CoV containing the S-gene and 3a sequences from PEDV within a backbone of TGEV has been reported in Italy (Belsham et al., 2016). Similar chimeric viruses were also reported in Germany and Slovakia (Akimkin et al., 2016; Mandelik et al., 2018). It was proven experimentally that co-infections with PEDV and TGEV in cultured cells enhanced the damage to tight junctions and the remodeling of microfilaments compared with single infections with the same viruses (Belsham et al., 2016). Co-infections with PEDV and PDCoV in pigs have also be reported in several studies previously (Dong et al., 2015; Jang et al., 2017; Song et al., 2015). Before the outbreak of PEAV in farms in China in 2017, PEDV broke out in the same farms, indicating possible concurrent infections with PEDV and PEAV (Gong et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). Together, co-infections with different swine enteric CoVs are an enormous threat to pig production. Thus, to dissect the mechanisms involved in co-infection with swine enteric CoVs in vivo or in vitro is receiving increasing attention. The IPI-FX cells established here are highly susceptible to all four swine enteric CoVs, and are derived from the ileum of porcine intestinal tracts, the common natural target of these enteric CoVs. Therefore, the IPI-FX cell line is an ideal cell model to study co-infections of swine enteric CoVs.",
