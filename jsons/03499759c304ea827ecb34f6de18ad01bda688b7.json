A vital step in the combat towards COVID-19 is a successful screening of contaminated patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiological imaging using chest radiography. This study aimed to automatically detect COVID-19 pneumonia patients using digital chest x-ray images while maximizing the accuracy in detection using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). The dataset consists of 864 COVID-19, 1345 viral pneumonia and 1341 normal chest x-ray images. In this study, DCNN based model Inception V3 with transfer learning have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia infected patients using chest X-ray radiographs and achieved more than 96% accuracy. The results demonstrate that transfer learning proved to be effective, showed robust performance and easily deployable approach for COVID-19 detection.",

The highest quality level screening strategy utilized for testing the COVID-19 patients is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Response (RT-PCR) test on respiratory examples [5] . This procedure is the most generally utilized strategy for testing for COVID-19 identification however is a manual, confused, relentless and time-consuming process with a positivity rate of only 63 % [5] . The other diagnosis tools of COVID-19 can be clinical symptoms investigation, epidemiological history and positive radiographic images (computed tomography (CT)/Chest radiograph (CXR)) as well as positive pathogenic testing. The clinical attributes of serious COVID-19 contamination are that of bronchopneumonia causing fever, hack, dyspnea, and respiratory failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [6] [7] [8] [9] . Promptly accessible and radiological imaging is another major symptomatic instrument for COVID-19. Most of COVID-19 cases have comparable highlights on radiographic pictures including reciprocal, multi-focal, ground-glass opacities with a fringe or back dissemination, primarily in the lower projections, in the early stage and pulmonary consolidation in the late stage [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Although typical CXR images may help early screening of suspected cases, the pictures of different viral cases of pneumonia are comparative and they overlap with other infectious and inflammatory lung diseases. Therefore, it is hard for radiologists to recognize COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia. The side effects of COVID-19 being like viral pneumonia can at times lead to wrong determination in the present circumstance, where medical clinics are over-burden and working nonstop. Therefore, incorrect diagnosis can prompt a non-COVID viral Pneumonia being falsely marked as exceptionally suspicious of having COVID-19 and in this manner deferring in treatment with resulting costs, exertion and danger of presentation to positive COVID-19 patients. Currently many biomedical complications (e.g., brain tumor detection, breast cancer detection, etc.) are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) based solutions [16] [17] [18] [19] . Deep learning techniques can reveal image features, which are not apparent in the original images. In particular, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been demonstrated amazingly helpful in include extraction and learning and therefore widely adopted by the research community [20] . CNN was utilized to improve picture quality in low-light pictures from a high-speed video endoscopy [21] and was additionally applied to distinguish the idea of aspiratory knobs through CT pictures, the conclusion of pediatric pneumonia by means of chest X-ray pictures, robotized marking of polyps during colonoscopy recordings, cryptoscopic picture acknowledgment extraction from recordings [22] [23] [24] [25] . Machine learning techniques on chest X-Rays are getting popularity as they can be easily utilized with low-cost imaging techniques and there is an abundance of data available for training different machine-learning models. was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Because of the limited availability of COVID-19 testing kits, we have to depend on different determination measures. Since COVID-19 assaults the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can utilize X-rays to investigate the strength of a patient's lungs. The medical practitioner frequently uses X-ray images to analyze pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and enlarged lymph nodes. And almost in all hospitals have X-ray imaging machines, it could be possible to use Xray's to test for COVID-19 without the dedicated test kits. Again, a drawback is that X-ray examination requires a radiology master and takes huge time, which is valuable when people are sick around the world.

            "text": "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique [39] which is based on the concept of reusability Transfer learning is often used with CNN in the way that all layers are kept except the last one, which is trained for the specific problem. This technique can be particularly useful for medical applications since it does not require as much training data, which can be hard to get in medical situations. In the analysis of medical data, one of the biggest difficulties faced by researchers is the limited number of available datasets. Deep learning models often need a lot of data. Labeling this data by experts is both costly and time consuming. The biggest advantage of using transfer learning method is that it allows the training of data with fewer datasets and requires less calculation costs. With the transfer learning method, which is widely used in the field of deep learning, the information gained by the pre-trained model on a large dataset is transferred to the model to be trained. Fig. 2 defines the Inception V3 model which performs convolution, pooling, softmax and fully connected procedures. Here a pre-trained neural network established for one task can be utilized as the initial point of another task. The Inception-v3 architecture comprises two fragments:",

Chest X-ray images are taken as input, Inception V3 is applied, convolution, pooling, softmax, and fully connected processes are performed. Upon completing these tasks, they are classified according to different training modules and eventually classified as normal, viral pneumonia and COVID-19 classes. Inception V3 is one of the states of art architectures in image classification challenge.

Popular pre-trained model Inception V3 has been trained and after training, the model was experienced on chest X-ray images of COVID-19, normal and viral pneumonia that are not used in the training phase. We have obtained the best performance as an accuracy of more than 96%. The experimental work is done by connecting the docker to the virtual box.

After all the bottlenecks have been created, the last few layers of the model are trained. We have set the training steps to 4000, which is sufficient to generate sufficient outcomes. There are a series of accuracy, cross-entropy, and verification accuracy as shown in Fig. 5. (B) . Training accuracy indicates a correctly labeled share of the current training image.

This repository is containing chest X-ray/CT images of mainly patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In addition, 330 COVID-19 positive radiographic images (CXR and CT) were carefully chosen from Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) COVID-19 DATABASE [42]. Out of 330 radiographic images, 70 images are chest x-ray images and 250 images are lung CT images. This database is updated in a random manner and until 29 March 2020, there were 63 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in this database. In addition, 2905 chest X-ray images were selected from COVID-19 Radiography Database [43]. Out of 2905 radiographic images, there are 219 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images and 1345 viral pneumonia images.
