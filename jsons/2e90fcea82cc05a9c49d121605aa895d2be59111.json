            "text": "This study investigated the seroepidemiology of Hendra virus in a spectacled flying-fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) population in northern Australia, near the location of an equine and associated human Hendra virus infection in late 2004. The pattern of infection in the population was investigated using a serial cross-sectional serological study over a 25-month period, with blood sampled from 521 individuals over six sampling sessions. Antibody titres to the virus were determined by virus neutralisation test. In contrast to the expected episodic infection pattern, we observed that seroprevalence gradually increased over the two years suggesting infection was endemic in the population over the study period. Our results suggested age, pregnancy and lactation were significant risk factors for a detectable neutralizing antibody response. Antibody titres were significantly higher in females than males, with the highest titres occurring in pregnant animals. Temporal variation in antibody titres suggests that herd immunity to the virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis. These findings support an endemic infection pattern of henipaviruses in bat populations suggesting their infection dynamics may differ significantly from the acute, self limiting episodic pattern observed with related viruses (e.g. measles virus, phocine distemper virus, rinderpest virus) hence requiring a much smaller critical host population size to sustain the virus. These findings help inform predictive modelling of henipavirus infection in bat populations, and indicate that the life cycle of the reservoir species should be taken into account when developing risk management strategies for henipaviruses.",

            "text": "Our finding that late pregnancy and lactation were risk factors for HeV seropositivity are concordant with results presented by Plowright et al. [14] on P. scapulatus. Furthermore, the reproductive cycle in other bat species has been linked to seropositivity and viral activity of filoviruses, coronaviruses, lyssaviruses and astroviruses [20, 21, 22] . Our study identified the highest seroprevalence in the first few weeks of lactation, indicated by a seroprevalence of 75.0% in females carrying pups ( Figure 2 ). Our study also supports the conclusions of Field (unpublished data) and Plowright et al. [14] that maternal transfer of HeV antibodies to juveniles likely occurs, evidenced by the higher seroprevalence of juveniles (58.3%) than sub-adults (39.9%), and a correspondingly higher seroprevalence of adults (60.3%). These findings are consistent with horizontal transmission of the virus, however the observed seroprevalence pattern does not preclude the occurrence of vertical transmission. Vertical transmission may contribute to viral persistence in bat populations, and there is evidence that vertical transmission of HeV occurs from experimental infection studies of flying-foxes and guinea pigs [15] and from natural infection in wild flying-foxes (Field unpublished data) [16] . Numerous viruses can be transmitted both horizontally and vertically (e.g. transplacentally), including human polyoma virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, feline leukaemia virus and parvoviruses (porcine, canine and feline) [17] . For females to be classified as adult in our study they must have shown signs of prior lactation (i.e. enlarged nipples; figure 2), and hence a previous pregnancy and lactation. Our finding that HeV seroprevalence in early lactation was significantly higher than adult females that were not pregnant or lactating (early lactation; 75.5%; not pregnant or lactating: 48.7%; p-value = 0.047) is evidence for a decline in HeV seroprevalence in females in the life stage following lactation. Such a decline suggests that detectable immunity to HeV is not long lived in P. conspicillatus, and the pattern seen may reflect seasonal variation in response to repeated exposure. This variation is contrary to the assumption that HeV induces long-lived detectable immunity in P. conspicillatus and P. poliocephalus (e.g. [14] ), and suggests that the transmission dynamics of henipaviruses may be different to those of the closely related morbilliviruses. Indeed, the mechanism of survival of henipaviruses at the population level appears more likely to be one of endemic infection, perhaps similar to that found in bovine viral diarrhoea virus, classical swine fever or some herpes viruses utilising persistent infection, or vertical transmission, as found in arenaviruses or retroviruses [17] . These patterns of infection require much smaller critical host population sizes, in contrast to viruses that demonstrate an acute self-limiting episodic infection pattern determined by: a build-up of susceptibles, introduction of virus, and environmental conditions that promote spread (e.g. measles, Newcastle disease virus or canine distemper virus; [17] ; See Figure 1, panel B) .",

[14] over a 16-month period on little red flying-foxes, P. scapulatus, sought to determine the factors that drive HeV spillover. Their study suggested that age, sex, body size, pregnancy, lactation, season and mating behaviour were possible risk factors for HeV infection, and that horizontal transmission was the major mode of transmission between individuals. They also reported a rapid seroprevalence decline between two successive sampling sessions. However, given their sampling at multiple locations, the expansive geographic distribution and highly nomadic nature of P. scapulatus [23] , it is plausible that they were not sampling the same population over time. In contrast, the species in our study, P. conspicillatus, is not a nomadic species and has a restricted distribution to the Wet Tropics of northeast Queensland [18] . Furthermore, our study was conducted within 10 km of a location where an HeV outbreak occurred in October 2004 [5] , and we collected samples from a single colony of P. conspicillatus on six separate occasions over a 25-month period. Consequently, we are confident that we followed the infection dynamics of a single population of P. conspicillatus over the study period. Nonetheless, interpretation of results from studies in wild animal populations should be made with care. Capture of bats by mist-netting provides a statistically non-random sample of the population, and the practicalities of sampling from a roost site of many thousands of individuals also precludes following individuals over time. To counter these issues, we sought to investigate potential bias and confounding effects where possible. Future studies on henipavirus infection dynamics in wild bats may benefit from: permanent marking of individuals to identify possible repeated capture and sampling of some animals; improved diagnostic capabilities to increase the probability of detection of viral shedding; and improved telemetry methods to enhance the understanding of movement of individuals between roost locations.",

Rather we suggest that endemic infection of P. conspicillatus occurs, perhaps with periodic pulses of viral transmission associated with late pregnancy and early lactation. The consistent increase in seroprevalence over the duration of our study, together with increasing titres over the first five sessions followed by a drop in titre in the last session, also suggest the presence of inter-annual factors may be affecting viral transmission. An increase in viral transmission associated with pregnancy in flying-foxes is plausibly concordant with the temporal pattern of some HeV incidents in horses in Australia [5] , and of NiV outbreaks in humans in Bangladesh and India [12] . This pattern suggests that the risk of henipavirus transmission from flying-foxes to domestic animals and/or humans is higher during the gestation period of flying-foxes. Thus, it is plausible that spillover risk may be uniformly spatially distributed wherever pregnant flying-foxes are present. The observed spatial clustering of henipavirus incidents may be confounded by: surveillance intensity (passive surveillance is the only method used, with heightened awareness of disease likely in areas where previous incidents have occurred); variation in flying-fox population density (there is evidence of increasing movement of flying-foxes in eastern Australia into urban and rural areas [24] ); variation in horse density and husbandry practices; and as yet unidentified predisposing ecological or environmental factors (e.g. climate).",

Consequently, population structures and mechanisms of maintenance of infection may reflect the biology of the host species and level of ecological disruption, rather than only the biology of the virus.

Here we show that HeV infection in a population of Pteropus conspicillatus is likely to be endemic rather than episodic, as previously proposed for HeV in flying-foxes. We also present evidence for seasonal viral activity suggesting that immunity to the virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis. These findings should inform disease risk management and approaches for modelling henipavirus infection in bat populations. If the ongoing threat that these viruses pose to public health is to be mitigated, further work is required to clarify the principal mode(s) of transmission of henipaviruses in bats, and to comprehensively determine how these viruses persist in their reservoir hosts.",

It has been permanently occupied by Pteropus conspicillatus for at least ten years, usually containing 40,000 to 60,000 individuals, constituting approximately 20% of the Australian population of this threatened species [18, 28] . This is the closest known flying-fox colony to the property where the HeV spillover event occurred in October 2004 [5] .
