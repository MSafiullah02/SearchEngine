Hierarchical clustering was performed with one minus spearman rank correlation with average linkage within patients. The clinical outcomes were compared among the identified clusters using logistic regression for binary outcomes (ICU use, intubation, discharged alive, and other respiratory infections) and Cox proportional hazards model for time-to-event outcomes (in-hospital death and death censored hospitalization stay). Because some of the events were rare, Firth's bias reduction method based on penalized likelihood was used. 6 The survival curve and death-censored hospital stay curve were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, and the significance was assessed using the Log-rank test. p<0\u00b705 was considered statistically significant.

However, it is unclear whether there are any correlations among these parameters in COVID-19 patients, and whether there are specific groups in these patients that may show distinct clinical outcomes. To answer these questions, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis to compare various laboratory parameters in individual patient over the 14-day course. For the laboratory parameters, we focused on complete blood count, D-dimer, BUN, and ALT since they were significantly different between patients with influenza and COVID-19. We chose 154 COVID-19 and 23 influenza inpatients with at least 7 days of data points in each of these parameters to analyze. Five clusters (1 to 5 from far left to far right, respectively) were revealed in COVID-19 patients whereas no distinct clusters were identified in influenza patients due to lack of sufficient patients (Figure 3) .",

For Realtime Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay, total RNA was isolated using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The RT-PCR assay was developed in the molecular diagnostic laboratory at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, using primers, probes, reagents and procedure designated by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The viral RNA was amplified using a one-step procedure using TaqPath 1step RT qPCR master mix and CDC designed primers and probes (2019-nCOV Kit, IDT Coralville, IA). The products were amplified on the Quant Studio 6 flex system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) or Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Influenza testing Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza viruses with two assays: Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV from Cepheid Incorporation (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for testing patients in the emergency room and FilArray Respiratory Panel 2 from BioMerieux (Marcy-l'\u00c9toile, France) for inpatient testing. The Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay is a real-time RT-PCR-based assay for the detection and differentiation of influenza A and B viral RNA. The test was performed with the Cepheid GeneXpert system. The assay targets unique gene sequences that encode influenza A matrix (M), influenza A basic polymerase (PB2), and influenza A acidic (PA) proteins for influenza A virus and influenza B matrix (M) and influenza B nonstructural (NS) proteins for influenza B virus.
