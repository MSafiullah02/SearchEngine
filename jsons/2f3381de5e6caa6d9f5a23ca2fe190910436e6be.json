A chest computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral, diffuse and subpleural ground-glass opacities with a crazy-paving appearance, and a band of air space consolidation. The real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay (RT-PCR) of nasal swab returned positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Regarding the severity of the initial picture, he received a treatment by Cefotaxime, Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine. The patient progressively recovered without intensive care and left the hospital on April 8.",

He was apyretic and displayed no respiratory symptoms. The neurological examination showed generalized areflexia, severe flaccid paraparesis, mainly affecting proximal muscles, and a decreased proprioceptive length-dependent sensitivity involving the four limbs. We also found hypoesthesia to light touch and pinprick in lower extremities rather related to his medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2. The cerebral CT was normal. Serological tests for Campylobacter jejuni, HIV, syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were negative. Serum antiganglioside and anti-neuronal antibodies were absent. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses (day 6) revealed an increased protein level at 1.65 g/L, no pleocytosis and no intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins. PCR assays of the CSF were negative for SARS-CoV-2, CMV and EBV. Electrodiagnostic testing performed five days after the onset of neurological symptoms mainly showed delayed motor distal latencies in the upper limbs, absence of F-waves in the 4 limbs, conduction blocks in peroneal and tibial nerves bilaterally, very low motor conduction velocities, and absent sensory nerve action potentials except for radial nerves and median nerves at the palm (Table 1) . These electrophysiological results were compatible with a demyelinating neuropathy.",

One in Jingzhou, China with a parainfectious profile (H. , and five in northern Italy with a 5 to 10-days interval between the onset of the infection and the neurological symptoms (Toscano et al. 2020 ). In our case report, this interval was longer, as the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome started three weeks after the beginning and 7 days after the recovery from the SARS-CoV-2 infection, without documentation of any other infection during that period. Therefore, our case responds to the classic postinfectious pattern, as is seen in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome associated with Zika virus infections (Barbi et al. 2018; Cao-Lormeau et al. 2016 ). In addition, a critically illness neuropathy and/or myopathy secondary to intensive care is unlikely since our patient was not transferred to such a unit, alongside a relatively mild course of the disease. We suspect that the underlying mechanism is autoimmune cross-reactivity responsible for the subacute polyradiculoneuritis. It has been demonstrated that the seroconversion seems in place around 15 days after the onset of the disease, which is compatible with an autoimmune response in our patient (J. ). However, since serological tests for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are not currently available, this hypothesis cannot yet be fully proven.",
