The cough worsened abruptly with development of both fatigue and dyspnea at rest and with exertion. She had no previous episodes of acute rejection and no known viral respiratory tract illnesses since her transplant. Spirometry demonstrated forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.45 L (97% predicted) and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) of 2.42 L (78% predicted). A recent high\u2010resolution computed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrated chronic changes with clear lung fields (Fig. 1A). Her only other surgical history was a Nissen fundoplication for symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux that was performed before discharge after lung transplantation with complete resolution of symptoms. There was no history of HLA mismatch at the time of the transplant. Her current immunosuppression therapy was tacrolimus 3 mg twice daily, mycophenolate 500 mg twice daily, and prednisone 5 mg daily with other medications including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Her tacrolimus level was acceptable in the 7 ng/mL range.",

In 2005, community\u2010acquired respiratory viruses were reported to be associated with the development of acute rejection and BOS in a small cohort of patients 5. A total of 50 of 100 (50%) patients developed a respiratory viral illness with 33 (33%) having a specific viral etiology identified, including rhinovirus (n = 9), coronavirus (n = 8), RSV (n = 6), influenza A (n = 5), parainfluenza (n = 4), and human metapneumovirus (n = 1). A specific viral etiology was identified in 7 of 8 patients with subsequent acute rejection, including rhinovirus (n = 4), coronavirus OC43 (n = 1), RSV (n = 1), and influenza A virus (n = 1) 5. Moreover, 9 patients experienced a 20% or greater decline in FEV1 by 3 months, with 4 being positive for a respiratory virus (rhinovirus [n = 1], coronavirus [n = 2], and influenza A [n = 1]) 5. However, in another study, investigators reported that respiratory viral infection was not associated with subsequent graft dysfunction in a smaller cohort of 50 patients followed during a single winter season 6. A total of 32 (64%) patients had 49 symptomatic respiratory viral episodes, with documented infections including RSV (n = 8), influenza (n = 10), and parainfluenza (n = 1) 6.",

Subsequently, BOS onset or progression occurred in no patients with human metapneumovirus compared with a total of 5 of 13 (38%) patients with RSV at 6 months 7. Of these 5 patients with BOS, each of them reportedly had graft dysfunction at the time of the diagnosis of RSV infection 7. Of these, 3 of 5 patients with RSV initially recovered to baseline respiratory function after therapy but subsequently developed BOS, with a mean time to diagnosis of 11 weeks 7.",

We think that the aggressiveness of BOS was further supported by the rapid changes on CT imaging (Fig. 1 A and B). A myriad of abnormalities can be seen on CT imaging of the chest in BOS, including bronchiectasis, hyperlucency (air\u2010trapping), mosaic pattern of attenuation, thickening of septal lines, or tree\u2010in\u2010bud 8. CT imaging is often used as a complement to pulmonary function testing and bronchoscopy, to help differentiate causes of dyspnea and declines in pulmonary function in lung transplant recipients.",

This case further illustrates that different phenotypes of BOS do exist, and the fact that acute or chronic phenotypes can occur at any time after lung transplantation. The aggressiveness of this disorder was even more impressive in the patient presented herein, as compared with the cases reported in the prospective study by Hopkins et al. 7. Additional research is needed to identify the pathogenesis of RSV infection in relation to the development of BOS in lung transplant recipients, to help identify therapeutic targets to optimize outcomes in lung transplantation.",
