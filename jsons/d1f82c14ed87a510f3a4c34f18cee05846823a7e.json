In Australia, for example, a severe allergic reaction would be recorded if rash, allergic dyspnoea, angioedema, generalized pruritis or uticaria occurred within 24 h of the transfusion [7] . In the USA, a severe allergic reaction would be recorded if two or more symptoms (conjunctival oedema; oedema of lips, tongue and uvula; erythema and oedema of the periorbital area; generalized flushing; hypotension; localized angioedema; maculopapular rash; pruritus; respiratory distress or bronchospasm; urticaria) occurred during or within 4 h of the cessation of transfusion [48] . Moreover, in some countries such as New Zealand, both non-severe and severe allergic reactions are reported [17] (perhaps reflecting their higher rates as shown in Fig. 1 ) while in the USA, reporting of nonsevere allergic reactions is not required [48] . Other reasons for differences in rates may be variations in hospital-specific reporting practices and the mandatory/ voluntary nature of the reporting. For events such as delayed serologic transfusion reaction and delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction, the definition hinges on laboratory testing and not symptoms. Rate differences may be a reflection of the resources afforded for testing of alloantibodies and the feasibility of longitudinal observation. Information regarding follow-up procedures or standardization of procedures would enhance the interpretability of rates. Alternatively, haemovigilance programmes may reconsider the usefulness of expending resources to capture such data when the likelihood of consistent, meaningful information is low.

The requirements include the demonstration of the pathogen in the transfused component, or in the donor at the time of donation, or in an additional component from the same donation, or in an additional recipient of a component from the same donation [48] . Also required is documentation that there are no other potential exposures to the pathogen that could be identified in the recipient and either evidence that the recipient was not infected with the pathogen prior to transfusion or evidence that the pathogen strains are related by molecular or extended phenotypic comparison testing [48] . This is a difficult target to reach when such in-depth testing is not usually conducted with each transfusion. Therefore, the pooled rate of transfusion-transmitted bacterial sepsis was very low (0\u00c183/1 million RBC units). There are few published reports of prospective surveillance for comparison purposes. Barrett and colleagues [51] found a bacterial contamination rate of 3\u00c12/100 000 RBC units, while Dzieczkowski and colleagues [37] reported this rate to be 14\u00c11/100 000 RBC units.

There are avenues for improvement in existing haemovigilance systems. The addition of active surveillance components may enhance reporting. Expansion of electronic medical records to incorporate more information regarding blood administration may augment comprehensiveness. Adjunct programming routines could be enacted to capture pre-and post-transfusion temperatures so that detection of FNHTR could be improved.
