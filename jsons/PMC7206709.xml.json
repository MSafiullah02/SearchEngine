            "text": "Acute respiratory failure (ARF) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is a well-known indication for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) trial [1]. The benefits provided by this therapy are numerous and well-studied, the most prominent being reductions in mortality as well as in endotracheal intubation (ETI) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates [2, 3]. The main contraindication to NIV is the need for emergent ETI, considered to be mandatory when consciousness is severely impaired, when the patient is unable to cooperate, or when the airways need to be protected because of a high aspiration risk [4]. Unfortunately, COPD patients with ARF often meet these criteria because of hypercapnic coma, and the role of NIV in this setting is therefore still debated [5, 6]. Furthermore, some authors suggest that a pH < 7.25 is linked to a high risk of NIV failure event if a trial might still be considered [7, 8]. The underutilization of NIV in hypercapnic COPD exacerbations suggested by some reports might be at least partially due to these contraindications, which could encourage physicians to immediately proceed with ETI [9].",

The pulsed oxygen saturation was of 70% under supplementary oxygen (6 L/min) through nasal cannula. He was hemodynamically stable. Ventilation using a bag-valve mask was quickly initiated, and arterial blood gas obtained, showing severe respiratory acidosis (pH 7.07, pCO2 > 17.0 kPa, pO2 40.1 kPa, bicarbonates not recorded due to equipment error). The patient had signed a legal document asking not to be resuscitated nor intubated. A bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation NIV trial was started, and both intravenous aspirin and unfractionated heparin were administered. Constant medical surveillance was provided during transport. Upon arrival in the ER after 30 min of NIV, the patient had a GCS of 14. After 70 min of ventilation, a new arterial blood gas sample was drawn showing improvement of his respiratory acidosis (FiO2 32%: pH 7.24, pCO2 12.2 kPa, pO2 7.6 kPa, bicarbonates 38 mmol/L). Pulmonary embolism was ruled out by CT scan and, because of chest pain and elevated cardiac biomarkers, coronary catheterization was performed showing chronic proximal anterior-interventricular artery occlusion that was treated by stenting. The patient was then admitted to the ICU to continue NIV before being transferred to the internal medicine ward after 2 days and finally discharged from the hospital after 20 days.",

In both cases, we believe that clinical improvement was entirely due to NIV as it was the only effective treatment administered by the prehospital team.

For the first patient, NIV was tried because of the potential harmful effects of ETI and mechanical ventilation in the context of advanced COPD. Conversely, while the second patient undoubtedly met criteria for immediate ETI, the procedure was not performed to respect his will. Nevertheless, clinical improvement was even more spectacular in this case, with the patient recovering an almost normal level of consciousness in only 30 min.",
