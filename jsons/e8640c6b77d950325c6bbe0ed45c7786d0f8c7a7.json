Mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein occur at the most variable part of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and specific sites of S-protein have undergone positive selection impacting the viral pathogenicity. In the present work, we used high-throughput computation to design 100,000 mutants in RBD interfacial residues and identify novel affinityenhancing and affinity-weakening mutations. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can establish a higher rate of infectivity and pathogenesis when it acquires combinatorial mutations at the interfacial residues in RBD. Mapping of the mutational landscape of the interaction site suggests that a few of these residues are the hot-spot residues with a very high tendency to undergo positive selection. Knowledge of the affinity-enhancing mutations may guide the identification of potential cold-spots for this mutation as targets for developing a possible therapeutic strategy instead of hot-spots, and vice versa. Understanding of the molecular interactions between the virus and host protein presents a detailed systems view of viral infection mechanisms. The applications of the present research can be explored in multiple antiviral strategies, including monoclonal antibody therapy, vaccine design, and importantly in understanding the clinical pathogenesis of the virus itself. Our work presents research directions for the exploitation of nonconventional solutions for COVID-19.",

A cryo-EM trimeric structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in its prefusion conformation has been determined recently [2] . The prefusion trimer is destabilized upon ACE2 binding leading to the formation of a stable post-fusion state. Several structures of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD-ACE2 complex have also been elucidated, and the interfacial residues have been identified [4] [5] [6] . The SARS-CoV-2-RBD consists of seven \u03b2 sheets (\u03b21-\u03b27) with short connecting helices and loops forming the core structure. The \u03b25 and \u03b26 strands, \u03b14 and \u03b15 helices and loops are present as a short extended insertion between the \u03b24 and \u03b27 strands. This extended insertion is the receptor-binding motif that contains most interfacial residues. The residual interactions involved in RBD-ACE2 complex formation are also identified and rationalized, highlighting the crucial differences with other SARS-CoVs. Thus, S-protein represents the crucial therapeutic target, and focusing on the critical understanding of the molecular mechanism of RBD-ACE2 interaction and finding potential weaknesses can be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Several studies have identified specific replacement of critical amino acids between the S-protein of various SARS-CoVs that have rendered the human cells susceptible to the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection [2, 5-8]. The amino acid sequence variations between the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-CoVs have been elucidated [1, 9]. The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV possess a similar structure, despite amino acid variations at key residues [1].",

The affinity of RBD for its receptor ACE2 is one of the major determinants of the virus transmission rate. While SARS-CoV-2 has a relatively low mutation rate, genome data show the emergence of novel mutations with altered virulence. SARS-CoV-2 with D614G mutation is presently the most common mutant form of the virus, accelerating the spread of the pandemic in several countries [11, 12] . A molecular dynamics simulation study on the effect of RBD mutations, from recently reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes, showed that V367F, W436R, and D364Y displayed a higher affinity towards the ACE2 receptor [13] . On the contrary, in another study, the conserved residue R408 of RBD of S-protein present in the interface of RBD and ACE2 receptor, upon mutation to isoleucine was found to show reduced binding affinity by disrupting a hydrogen bond formed with glycan positioned at 90N from ACE2 [14] . Such findings highlight the importance of monitoring the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.",

Two recent studies identified such ACE2 variants and reported mutations that enhanced or decreased binding to S-protein, thereby potentially altering RBD-ACE2 interactions [15, 16] . However, the applications of their work are limited as natural variations in ACE2 in human populations are extremely rare. As a more rational approach to the problem, we decided to identify combinatorial mutations in the RBD interfacial residues that either increase or decrease its affinity towards the ACE2 receptor. This is crucial as the rapid spread of the virus provides it an ample opportunity for natural selection to act upon rare but favorable mutations. In the present work, we used high-throughput computational approaches to characterize the detailed RBD and ACE2 interaction networks and identify novel affinityenhancing and affinity-weakening mutations. The data provide crucial insights into interaction and mutational dynamics between RBD and ACE2 that could be explored for developing strategies for novel and effective therapeutics.",

Among the 59 interactions, 23 residues from RBD establish intermolecular contacts with the ACE2 interface ( Figure 1 ). We were curious to learn how the residues of RBD affect the stability when they are mutated systematically to other residues. To understand this, we obtained a mutation sensitivity profile, where the impact of each mutation at each possible position is visualized. It was found that the interface residues of RBD that interact with ACE2 are not highly stable at many positions with \u0394\u0394Gpred>0 (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Some of the hot-spot residues such as R403, G446, Y453, L455, F456, Y473, G485, Y489, F490, Y495, N501 and G502 with \u0394\u0394Gpred>0 suggests they are relatively unstable and likely more prone to mutation. It is noteworthy that some of these native RBD residues are already found to be mutated in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, as reported in the CoV-GLUE database, which publishes information on amino acid replacements, insertions, and deletions from genome sequences sampled from the pandemic (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/replacement). For instance, G446 to S, Y453 to S, F456 to L, Y473 to D/H, Y489 to S, F490 to L/S, Y495 to S/N, N501 to T, etc. This further confirms our mutational sensitivity profiling. However, this does not consider the flexibility of the backbone residues while suggesting the sensitivity profile, owing to which, we opted for interface designing focused on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to gain further structural insights.",

We found that the binding affinities ranged from -8.8 kcal/mol to -12.5 kcal/mol across the designs (Figure 4 ). When the binding affinities were compared, many of the designs scored higher in both methodologies, suggesting that they formed a higher number of interactions and contacts with ACE2 when certain positions of the RBD were mutated. An analysis of the number of intermolecular contacts versus the binding affinities (Figure 4) , further confirmed the assumption that Rosetta generated top-scored higher binding affinity designs can facilitate SARS-CoV-2 to establish stronger interactions with ACE2. Detailed decomposition of intermolecular contacts of the top five affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening designs further demonstrated that the numbers of intermolecular contacts, charged-apolar contacts, polar-polar contacts, apolarpolar contacts, and apolar-apolar contacts primarily drive the affinity-enhancing or affinityweakening RBD mutants towards ACE2 (Tables 2 and 3 ).",

In cerebro analysis revealed a significantly higher number of interactions with a much compact binding interface for the affinity-enhancing Design-1 ( Figure 5A ) as compared to affinity-weakening Design-1 ( Figure 5B ).

Finally, the residue level interactions between ACE2 and RBD for the top-ranked affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening designs were obtained by the DIMPLOT program, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4 Thus, the blocking of S-protein to ACE2 receptor interaction, and cell fusion is one of the key strategies for antiviral development. The binding free energy of RBD to ACE2 is the key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. The higher affinity of SARS-CoV-2-RBD to ACE2 is attributed to the presence of an extended network of favorable hydrogen bond networks between the interacting partners. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2-RBD displays a 10-20 fold stronger affinity for ACE2 compared with the RBD of other SARS-CoVs [2, 3] . This suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 encodes distinct epitope properties in the RBD from other SARS-CoVs.",

Multiple virus and hostdependent processes contribute to viral diversity by encouraging mutations in the viral proteins to adapt to a new host and environment [26] . Mutations in the viral binding proteins modulate infectivity and alter antigenicity leading to species specificity, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2-RBD. The spike gene of the SARS-CoV-2 may be recombined with the other SARS-CoVs due to convergent evolution (with its relatively high mutation rate), which is the very nature of SARS-CoVs [27] . Under natural selection and evolutionary pressure, the SARS-CoV-2-RBD has undergone several mutations conferring stability to the viral particle [1, 9, 28] . Pieces of evidence are accumulating on viruses undergoing positive selection suggesting the emergence of a more transmissible form of SARS-CoV-2 [29] [30] [31] . However, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is not particularly high with respect to other SARS-CoVs, but they do accumulate with time. Thus, as the epidemic progresses, accumulations of further mutations due to positive selective pressure could favor an enhancement of pathogenicity and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This may accelerate the risk for antigenic drift and the accumulation of immunologically significant mutations in the population.",

Mutations at other positions in the PPI interfaces are known as 'cold spots' and do not significantly affect or may sometime increase the binding affinity [32] . Knowledge of the direction of mutational pressure may help design more effective therapeutic strategies. If the affinity-enhancing mutations are known, one may try to choose \"cold-spots\" for this mutation as targets for developing a possible therapeutic strategy instead of \"hot-spots\". A comparison of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences suggests that the rate of non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 is less than that of synonymous ones indicating that the active SARS-CoV-2 is at present under the control of negative selection. This is because presently, the virus is not under significant immune or drug pressure. If these pressures mount, the positive selection of non-synonymous mutations will accumulate much rapidly. This will cause a change in the viral phenotype allowing it to evade the host immune system and also develop drug resistance [33] . Thus, the weakening of the RBD-ACE2 complex interaction by modulating affinity-enhancing/affinity-weakening mutations represents a possible therapeutic strategy.",
