Coronavirus infections were identified using archived serum and nasal respiratory secretions previously collected during respiratory illness surveillance encompassing 4 consecutive winters (15 November\u201415 April) of 1999\u20132003 in Rochester, New York. Three prospective cohorts (healthy persons \u226565 years of age, young adults 19\u201340 years of age, and high-risk adults with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or congestive heart failure) were enrolled in the late summer/early fall of each year and participated for a maximum of 2 winters. Approximately half of the subjects in the prospective cohorts were replaced each year using a rolling enrollment strategy. Upon enrollment, demographics, medical history, and directed respiratory examination were recorded and a serum specimen was obtained. Prospective subjects were asked to notify study staff of acute respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, increased or new sputum, dyspnea, wheezing with or without fever), at which time the signs and symptoms of illness were recorded and nose and throat swabs and acute serum specimen were collected. Four to 6 weeks later, a follow-up assessment was performed and convalescent serum samples were collected. At the conclusion of each season, subjects were queried about any other respiratory illnesses during the season, and a serum sample was obtained.",

The supernatant fluid was pelleted in a Beckman SW27 rotor at 20 000 rpm for 90 minutes, resuspended in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris/140 mM NaCl/10 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), and sonicated, and the virus was purified on a 20%/60% discontinuous sucrose gradient (32 000 rpm in a SW41 rotor for 100 minutes).

OC43 (ATCC VR 759) was grown in HRT-18G cells (obtained from ATCC, CRL-11663) until cytopathic effect was extensive, at which time cells were scraped into the supernatant and clarified [14].

CoV antigens coated onto enzyme immunoassay plates and control plates were coated with uninfected cell preparations. Serial 2-fold dilutions of sera were incubated in antigen-coated plates and developed by addition of alkaline phosphatase\u2013conjugated goat antihuman immunoglobulin G (IgG) followed by substrate. The usual convention of a \u22654-fold rise in serum IgG specific for the CoV antigens was considered evidence of infection.",

However, unlike influenza, the impact and importance of other respiratory viruses are less well documented in this age group. Although coronaviruses have been identified in elderly adults and high-risk populations such as those with COPD, cystic fibrosis, or immune deficiencies, only a few studies have included extended periods or directly compared results to other viruses [10, 11, 15\u201319]. Our data indicate that depending upon the year, 3%\u201326% of prospectively enrolled outpatients were infected with OC43 and 229E CoV strains. More importantly, among the hospital cohort the incidence of coronavirus infection varied from 3.3% to 11.8%, with an average of 6.8% per year. These findings are consistent with reports from other investigators. In a 1-year analysis of 2215 patients with COPD enrolled in an influenza vaccine efficacy study, Gorse et al identified coronaviruses in 14% of acute influenza-like illnesses (defined as \u22653 respiratory symptoms or fever plus 2 respiratory symptoms), a rate similar to that of influenza [10]. In that study, OC43 was approximately 3 times more common than 229E; however, asymptomatic infection was not sought and thus the true number of infections was likely greater. In our study, we used less stringent criteria for evaluation and thus we likely detected a broader spectrum of illness. In contrast to our study, Gorse et al found that coronavirus and influenza infections were equally associated with the need for hospitalization, although only influenza was temporally linked to impairment of pulmonary function. In a community-based study from the Netherlands, Graat et al detected coronaviruses by RT-PCR in 19% of 97 elderly subjects during a 1-year period, none of whom required hospitalization [20]. In studies from Houston, Texas, Greenberg identified OC43 or 229E in 16 of 62 COPD patients during 30 months of surveillance, with the majority of infections caused by OC43, whereas Glezen et al diagnosed serologically confirmed 229E or OC43 infection in 3.4% of 417 hospitalized adults during a 4-year period [11, 15]. In an analysis of a large number of outpatient respiratory illnesses in the United Kingdom, Gaunt identified CoV in approximately 1.1% of older adults over 3 years [8]. In that study, lower respiratory tract illness was noted in 43% of OC43 infections, but in no 229E infections.",

OC43 infection was significantly less likely to be asymptomatic or associated with mixed viral infection, the latter a common finding also noted by other investigators. We defined asymptomatic infection by a positive serologic rise during an asymptomatic interval rather than by a positive PCR in asymptomatic persons. The latter may represent \u201ccolonization\u201d whereas the former likely represents true infection. The true frequency of coinfections is likely to be considerably greater, as we did not assess subjects for rhinovirus and we only performed culture for parainfluenza viruses. The most frequent coinfecting viruses, RSV and hMPV, have previously been shown by us and others to account for significant morbidity in elderly adults [12, 13, 21\u201323]. Thus, the observed illness in coinfected subjects may primarily be attributable to the coinfecting virus, a suggestion made by Prill et al in a study of CoV infection in infants [24]. Perhaps most significant is the lower ratio of outpatient infections to inpatient infections for OC43 compared to 229E, suggesting a virulence difference between strains. Our results imply that in elderly adults with a high incidence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease, it would require approximately 3-fold more outpatient 229E infections than OC43 infections to result in an equivalent number of hospitalizations. Although another group of investigators also simultaneously measured the incidence of infection in outpatient and hospitalized adults in the same community with a similar trend, they did not differentiate the coronavirus or influenza strains in the outpatient groups [11, 15].",

Although the relative impact of coronavirus infection appears to be less than the other viruses, the overall burden, particularly for OC43, is not insignificant. Less virulent organisms, such as rhinoviruses, have also been shown to have significant overall disease burden in the elderly due to their relatively high prevalence [25]. Using our coronavirus data in relation to influenza A during the 4-year period of surveillance and eliminating viral coinfections, the hospital burden of these 2 coronaviruses combined was approximately 47% of the influenza A.",

In some studies, NL63 or HKU1 has been more frequently identified than OC43 and 229E, although the majority reported OC43 to be the most common coronavirus strain identified [8, 9, 17\u201319, 24, 26]. It is possible that some of our subjects diagnosed with OC43 or 229E by serology alone could include HKU1 or NL63 infections due to antigenic cross-reactivity within coronavirus groups [27]. In addition, we also did not include an asymptomatic control group for the hospital cohort to assess illness causality, as done in one pediatric study [24]. Futhermore, viral coinfections were likely underestimated, and thus the attributable impact of CoV infection may be overestimated. Finally, our study was limited to winter seasons, and although coronaviruses tend to be most active in the winter, we likely missed some CoV infections, especially in year 2 when OC43 was highly active at the start of our surveillance period. Because we performed serology for each winter season separately, we would not have detected summer illnesses.",
