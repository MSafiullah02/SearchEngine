            "text": "Background: Evaluating cirrhotic severity is essential for individualizing surgical modalities for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study proposed a non-invasive method named cirrhotic severity scoring (CSS) to stage liver cirrhosis. Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15) has been widely used for the preoperative evaluation of hepatic functional reserve; however, whether ICG-R15 is well correlated with cirrhotic severity, and especially whether comparable with CSS in predicting cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function remains unknown. Methods: Overall, 510 HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function undergoing hepatectomy between January 2011 and December 2014 were retrospectively studied. Cirrhotic severity was pathologically assessed using the Laennec staging system. The correlations between ICG-R15, CSS, and cirrhotic severity were analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of ICG-R15 and CSS in predicting posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and 90-day mortality was compared. Results: Patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis accounted for 15.9%, 29.2%, 35.9%, and 19.0%, respectively, in the entire cohort. ICG-R15 was found to be less than 10% in 100%, 93.3%, 86.3%, and 70.1% of the patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis, respectively. There was only a weak correlation between ICG-R15 and the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.325; P < 0.001). However, CSS showed a strong correlation with the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.788; P < 0.001). For those with ICG-R15 in the normal range, the accuracy of CSS in diagnosing no/mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis was 89.1%, 72.8%, and 72.1%, respectively. In addition, CSS was superior to ICG-R15 in predicting PHLF and 90-day mortality.",

Nevertheless, it is an invasive procedure, and its results are influenced by several factors, such as inter-observer variability and sampling errors [12, 13] . Thus, liver biopsy is not recommended to be performed in the preoperative evaluation of cirrhotic severity. The cirrhotic severity scoring (CSS) was previously developed by our team as a non-invasive method to stage liver cirrhosis in HCC patients [14] . It relies on the patient's portal vein diameter, splenic thickness, platelet count, and varicosity, which are routinely measured and available for virtually all patients with HCC scheduled for hepatectomy. This method has exhibited a high degree of diagnostic accuracy in predicting the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis; however, whether CSS is superior to ICG-R15 in assessing cirrhotic severity remains unexplored.",

A total of 510 HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function who underwent hepatic resection at the Hepatic Surgery Center of Tongji Hospital between January 2011 and December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received routine blood tests, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, computed tomography, and ICG-R15 for preoperative assessment. Clinicopathological records of all patients were obtained from the computerized database maintained by Tongji Hospital. The grades of esophageal varices were classified as follows: mild, straight varices not disappearing with insufflations; moderate, enlarged tortuous, occupying less than 1/3 of the lumen; and severe, coil-shaped, occupying more than 1/3 of the lumen [15] . Major resection was defined as resection of 3 or more Couinaud liver segments [16] . PHLF was defined by an increased international normalized ratio and concomitant hyperbilirubinaemia on or after postoperative day 5 as proposed by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery [4] . Postoperative mortality was defined as death within 90 days after hepatectomy.",

Based on the levels of ICG-R15, a decision tree was proposed for guiding the safe extent of hepatectomy, and ICG-R15 test was regarded as the most determining factor in this decision tree [19] . For example, trisectorectomy or bisectorectomy can be allowed in patients with an ICG-R15 value below 10%. However, this algorithm did not take cirrhotic severity into consideration. The present study indicated that in 446 patients with ICG-R15 in the normal range, the proportion of patients with moderate or severe cirrhosis was as high as 50.7%. Under this circumstance, it would not be appropriate to determine the extent of hepatectomy only based on the ICG-R15 value. Cirrhotic severity cannot be neglected when making surgical decisions. A study conducted by Ishikawa in 139 HCC patients undergoing hepatic resection over a 10-year period revealed that both liver cirrhosis and ICG-R15 had a marked effect on the incidence of postoperative complications [20] . Our previous research also demonstrated that the incidence of PHLF was 38.1% in patients with moderate cirrhosis after resection of 3 or more liver segments and 63.2% in those with severe cirrhosis after resection of 2 or more liver segments. Thus, only minor resection could be recommended to patients with moderate or severe cirrhosis [6] .",

Lau et al. [22] also found that ICG-R15 in HCC patients with cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis was higher than that in patients with normal liver. It was suggested that intrahepatic vascular shunts and sinusoidal capillarization might be the main reasons why ICG-R15 was increased in patients with cirrhosis [11] . However, whether ICG-R15 is helpful in predicting the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function remains unknown. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first in this regard. In this study, liver cirrhosis was pathologically staged according to the Laennec staging system. Although ICG-R15 was increased with more severe liver cirrhosis in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function, correlation analysis revealed that ICG-R15 was weakly correlated with the Laennec stage (r = 0.325; P < 0.001). Besides, the majority of patients in the corresponding cirrhotic stage had an ICG-R15 value below 10%. ROC analysis further showed that the AUCs of ICG-R15 in the diagnosis of moderate and severe cirrhosis were only 0.663 and 0.707, respectively. These results indicated that ICG-R15 was not reliable in assessing cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function.",

However, these methods were employed to assess the severity of liver fibrosis rather than cirrhosis. It is unclear whether they are effective in evaluating cirrhotic severity in HCC patients. In 2016, we proposed a noninvasive method named CSS to predict cirrhotic severity [14] . The CSS is based on clinical parameters that are easily obtained through preoperative examinations. In this study, we demonstrated that CSS was significantly correlated with the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function (r = 0.788; P < 0.001), consistent with previous findings [14] . In addition, we compared the efficacy of ICG-R15 with CSS in assessing cirrhotic severity and found that CSS showed a stronger correlation with the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis than did ICG-R15 and a better performance than ICG-R15 in the prediction of moderate and severe cirrhosis. Our study further revealed that in patients with a normal ICG-R15 value, the accuracy of CSS in diagnosing no/mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis was 89.09%, 72.78%, and 72.06%, respectively. Therefore, CSS could function as a useful non-invasive method to assess cirrhotic severity even in HCC patients with an ICG-R15 value below 10%.",
