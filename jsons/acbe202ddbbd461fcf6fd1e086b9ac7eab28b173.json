P-spline smoothed lines [3] [4] [5] were fitted to logarithmic transformed CVD and non-CVD mortality rates in each 5-year age band from 1990 to 2016 by sex using the pspline function is Stata (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC). Change in P-spline smoothed values of log-transformed mortality rates over subsequent years followed a normal distribution. To obtain missing values for change in mortality rates in future years, linear regression models were fitted to the change in log-transformed mortality rates over subsequent years by sex with interaction terms for 5-year age groups. Linear predictions calculated from the linear regression coefficients represented predicted change in log-mortality rates for subsequent years which were used to project mortality rates to the future until 2060. For all age-groups P-spline smoothed log-transformed mortality rates declined over time but the magnitude of decline also declined, resulting in projected mortality rates reaching a plateau in the decades to come. Standard error for the linear predictor was calculated as time in years multiplied by the standard error of the linear prediction.This method closely matches the method used for the official mortality projections used by the ONS [6] . All-cause mortality rates projected to the future using the described method closely matched all-cause mortality rate projections from the ONS (not shown)",

Because of above, this validation confirms internal consistency of the model rather than real-world validity of the projections.

The result of this process is shown in ESM Fig. 12 and manuscript Table 1 : PHE model does not allow to project diabetes prevalence stratified by age and sex. We used then age/sex gradient for the prevalence of diabetes from another source, assuming this gradient will be similar across calendar years of the projections. A Canadian study data was used to obtain this gradient since no English national studies known to authors reported diabetes prevalence for older age groups [49] . Then the distribution was smoothed across age groups to obtain single age-stratified values.",
