Nonetheless, drug-resistant HIV is increasingly problematic. Part of this problem stems from the prevalence of recombination and mutation observed in HIV [4], [5], [6]. Not surprisingly, drug-resistant HIV is increasingly reported in the literature [5].",

The exact mechanisms of drug resistance vary as well. Multiple mutations in the RT and PR genes of HIV that are associated with drug resistance have been identified, and studies continue to characterize these mutations [9], [10], [11]. Current clinical guidelines recommend resistance typing in HIV patients before beginning antiretroviral therapy [12], [13]. For the moment, antiretroviral therapy guided by resistance typing appears to improve patient outcomes [14], [15], [16].",

Recombinant factor VII/tissue factor inhibitor has been successfully used to treat EBOV VHF in rhesus macaque monkeys [22].

This segmented genome has raised the question of genetic variation in hantaviruses. Genetic drift clearly plays a role [42], [43]. The role of genetic shift is less clear. Studies have demonstrated that diploid strains are unstable, but reassorted virus has been reported with genetic variants of SNV and Dobrava virus [44], [45]. Notably, homologous recombination\u2014the first instance of such recombination in negative-sense RNA viruses\u2014was first described in Tula virus, and later in Dobrava virus [45], [46]. Nonetheless, human infections appear to be more due to encroachment upon hantavirus host habitats (or vice versa) than to fundamental changes in the viruses themselves [41], [47].",

Follow-up studies suggest that NiV can lead to a remitting-relapsing pattern of neurologic disease as well [78]. In pigs, NiV caused an acute respiratory illness with fever and sometimes nervous signs. A recent outbreak of Nipah virus in Bangladesh also appeared encephalitic, but was epidemiologically distinct; contact with pigs was not a major factor [211]. This epidemiologic distinction has raised speculation about a third henipavirus [79].",

Recent reports using real-time PCR and oligonucleotide microarray techniques appear promising [124], [125], [126]. Currently, laboratory diagnosis depends on cell culture or chick chorioallantoic membrane isolation in conjunction with DNA-based assays [123]. Cutaneous tissue (eg, vesicular material) and blood can be used for diagnostic purposes [127]. The reader is referred to the CDC for more detailed information on specimen collection and transport [82]. MPV can be safely handled under BSL-2 conditions, but if variola virus is suspected, referral of specimens to the state public health laboratory for analysis at the CDC is prudent [82].",

One to a few papules develop, forming nodules with regional lymphadenopathy that resolve about 6 weeks after the onset of clinical disease [137].

No vaccine or treatment currently exists for TPV infection, but historically the disease is self-limiting [135].",

In some instances, \u201csuper spreaders\u201d\u2014a few cases causing a disproportionate number of successive transmissions\u2014have been noted [160], [161]. SARS-CoV has been isolated from multiple specimen types, including blood, suggesting systemic spread through the body [162], [163]. Clinical features of SARS include an incubation period of 2 to 10 days with a mean of 6 days [155], [164]. Initial symptoms include fever (>38\u00b0C), malaise, myalgia, and chills or rigors [155], [164], with respiratory symptoms and sometimes watery diarrhea occurring later in the course of illness [155]. SARS is less commonly associated with upper respiratory symptoms like rhinorrhea or sore throat [155]. Regarding severity, one third of patients improve spontaneously, whereas 20% to 30% of patients will require intensive care, most of which will need mechanical ventilation [164], [165]. In autopsy specimens, diffuse alveolar damage is seen in various levels of progression and severity (Fig. 2)\n[154]. Age (older than 65) and coexisting illness predict a worse course. Death is attributed to respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, or comorbidity with existing medical conditions [155], [164]. Some studies suggest that interferons and corticosteroids may improve the clinical course of SARS [166], [167], but data from randomized placebo-controlled trials are still needed to demonstrate efficacy; in addition, the possible long-term sequelae of such therapy are unclear [168]. Investigators are currently studying the efficacy of antiviral drugs as well [169].",

In cell culture, SARS-CoV demonstrates CPE in the Vero E6 cell line as foci of cell rounding and cell refractiveness, with occasional syncytia (Fig. 3)\n[154]. However, real-time RT-PCR assays currently represent the mainstay of laboratory diagnosis; nasopharyngeal aspirates and swabs are the typical specimens of such tests. DNA microarray techniques may also be appearing in the near future [173]. Convalescent sera can be used to establish SARS infection retrospectively using whole virus immunoassays [155]. Biosafety protocols for handling materials containing SARS-CoV exist [174] and should be adhered to strictly: laboratory-acquired infections with SARS-CoV have occurred in Singapore and Taipei (the latter case in a BSL-4 laboratory) [175], [176].",

WNV is maintained in a cycle of transmission from mosquito to bird and back to mosquito. Although Culex species mosquitoes appear to be the primary vector [180], WNV has been found in other species (and in ticks in the Eastern Hemisphere) [181]. North American bird species can serve as hosts for WNV, and bird migration appears to play a role in the maintenance and propagation of the virus in nature [182], [183]. Natural mammalian infection with WNV has been documented only in horses and humans, both of which are considered dead-end hosts. However, case reports of transmission in utero, via breast-feeding, and through accidental percutaneous laboratory exposure, organ transplantation, and blood transfusion have been reported [184], [185], [186], [187], [188], [189], [190]. The last two routes have led to revision of blood donor deferral criteria and nucleic acid testing of donated blood [191], [192].",

For the moment, supportive management with ventilatory support and treatment for cerebral edema is the key measure; the benefits of prophylactic steroids or osmotic agents remain unknown. Human vaccines for WNV are not currently available, but are under research.",

We see hints of how these future viral infections will emerge in the infections covered by this article: by encroaching on previously unvisited habitats (eg, hantaviruses), by air travel (eg, SARS), and by accidental importation (eg, monkeypox). The example of SARS demonstrates not only how quickly emerging viral infections can spread but also how quickly they can be identified and contained with motivated cooperation. Likewise, research into vaccines and antiviral treatments for these viruses must continue.",
