All-cause mortality after 28 days has traditionally been the primary endpoint in these trials. However, with recent improvements in standard-of-care therapy, 28-day mortality is strongly dependent from other variables such as comorbid conditions and the adverse events of multiple interventions [5]. As such, it is reasonable that alternative endpoints need to be developed for sepsis. These endpoints need to provide earlier and accurate evaluation of the treatment effect under study.",

            "text": "Since sepsis is triggered by an infection, the endpoint of sepsis trials may be influenced by the attitude of regulatory bodies to focus new registration trials of antimicrobial agents towards early efficacy. The main example towards this end is the joint initiative between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the Biomarkers Consortium of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) on the update of primary endpoint definitions for non-inferiority trials for the management of infectious diseases. More precisely, the former test-of-cure visit usually taking place 7\u201314 days after end of treatment was replaced by the early response 48\u201372 h after start of treatment for acute bacterial skin and soft structure infections [6] and 3\u20135 days after start of treatment for community-acquired pneumonia [7], while efforts are being made to expand this concept to hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia [8, 9]. However, in order to develop a similar early endpoint for sepsis, it is mandatory that this endpoint is a predictor of 28-day mortality, i.e., the salient sequelum of sepsis and eventually of 90-day mortality that has recently emerged as a relevant clinical endpoint [10]. With the Sepsis-3 classification criteria, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is used as a measure of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. As a consequence, it is reasonable to define the earliest time point during the course of the disease where a clinical meaningful change of the baseline SOFA score is achieved.",

The predictive capacity of different follow-up day \u0394SOFA for mortality was evaluated with the area under the respective receiver operator characteristics (AUROC) curves and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The optimal cutoff value for prediction of 28-day mortality was calculated using Youden\u2019s index. The \u0394SOFA was expressed by medians and 95% CIs; comparisons between survivors and non-survivors were done by the Mann-Whitney U test. Breslow-Day's test was used to compare the performance of this cutoff value between the derivation and validation cohorts. A p value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

When the AUROCs of \u0394SOFA of follow-up days were compared, it was found that the earliest time point when the achieved AUROC was greater than previous days was on day 7 (Fig. 2b). When the absolute \u0394SOFA scores were compared over time between survivors and non-survivors, despite the significantly greater decreases in survivors from non-survivors found by non-parametric statistics at all time points, a great overlap of values was shown (Fig. 2c). This led us to consider the percentage change of baseline SOFA as a more appropriate expression of the sepsis course than the absolute \u0394SOFA. To this end, our analysis focused on the development of a specific value of \u0394SOFA of day 7 as an early predictor of 28-day mortality. The analysis using the Youden index showed that a 25% cutoff value could discriminate non-survivors from survivors with sensitivity 78.4% (95% CI 69.0\u201385.7%), specificity 80.3% (95% CI 75.7\u201384.3%), positive predictive value 54.1% (95% CI 45.7\u201362.2%), and negative predictive value 92.7% (95% CI 89.0\u201395.2%).\n",

The standard-of-care for patients remained approximately the same between these two periods since the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines remained largely unchanged between 2004 and 2008 as also where national recommendations for antimicrobial use. Baseline characteristics of the new cohorts shown in Additional file 1: Table S1 did not differ. The 25% change of initial SOFA score worked equally well for the prediction of both 28-day and 90-day mortality in both cohorts A and B (Table 4 and Additional file 2: Table S2, respectively).\n",

The validity of change of SOFA on day 7 as an early predictor of 28-day mortality was analyzed in a large post-marketing survey among patients with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, who were propensity-matched to receive either antithrombin III alone or combination therapy with thrombomodulin. Although no difference was found between the two groups, when they were analyzed together, it was found that these changes between day 1 and day 7 provided AUROC 0.81 for 28-day mortality [18]. In a cohort of severe sepsis and septic shock, day 3 \u0394SOFA displayed AUROC 0.68 (95% CI 056\u20130.79) whereas 50% SOFA decrease was associated with 61.3% sensitivity and 85.9% negative predictive value for ICU mortality prediction [19].",

In a study evaluating levosimendan compared to placebo in patients with septic shock (the LeoPARDS RCT), the primary endpoint was powered to detect an absolute difference in the mean SOFA score (calculated up to a maximum of 28 ICU days) of at least 0.5 between the two arms [20]. The MaxSep RCT, comparing meropenem alone or in combination with moxifloxacin, in patients with severe sepsis, aimed to demonstrate a minimum of 1.1 point difference in mean SOFA scores between the two arms (calculated for a maximum ICU stay of 14 days) [21].
