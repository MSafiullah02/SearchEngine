Whitt, University of Tennessee) culture supernatant by Qiagen QIAamp RNA mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Five fragments of VSV genome were generated by RT-PCR and assembled into a full-length cDNA. The pBluescript SK (+) (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) was modified by inserting T7 terminator from pET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) between XbaI/SacI sites and was named as SK-Ter. The full-length cDNA of VSV was inserted between the T7 promoter and ribozyme sequence of hepatitis delta virus in SK-Ter [24], [25]. Two complementary oligonucleotides containing the transcript stop/start sequences and a XhoI site were cloned into NheI site between G and L genes [26]. The resulting plasmid was designated as pVSV. The plasmids named pSK-N, pSK-P, and pSK-L were constructed by cloning N, P, and L genes into pSK-Ter at XhoI/XbaI sites [27]. The HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 gene was modified so that the signal peptide of TPA from pJW4304 (a gift from Prof. James Mullins at University of Washington School of Medicine) was used to substitute the signal peptide of HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 and the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail of VSV-glycoprotein (VSV-G) were added to the C terminus of HIV-1 HXB2 gp120. The fusion gene encoding HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 aa 32\u2013505 was then cloned into pVSV plasmid using XhoI and NheI sites. The resulting plasmid was designated as pVSV-HXB2. Meanwhile, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and luciferase gene were also cloned into pVSV, respectively (designated as pVSV-eGFP and pVSV-luc).",

Nearly confluent cells (90% confluence) were infected with vTF7-3 (a gift from Prof. Bernard Moss at NIAID, NIH), a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was 10. Sixty minutes after infection, the cells were transfected with 4 \u03bcg each of pVSV-N and pVSV-P and 2 \u03bcg pVSV-L, and 10 \u03bcg pVSV-HXB2, pVSV-eGFP, pVSV-luc or pVSVFL(+) using a Lipofectamine 2000 transfection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cells were incubated at a 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h, and the cells on culture dishes were frozen/thawed three times. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min and debris was removed by passing through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. The supernatants were added to fresh BHK-21 cells at a ratio of 5 ml per 10 cm dish and incubated with the cells for 48 h. One milliliter of each supernatant was collected from these cells and added to another plate of fresh BHK-21 cells. Recovery of recombinant infectious VSVs was performed 48 h later and confirmed by development of cytopathic effect (CPE) in BHK-21 cells. The recombinant VSVs were propagated in BHK-21 cells and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. The titers of the recombinant VSVs were determined to be 108\u2013109\n pfu/ml using a standard plaque assay. The recombinant VSV-luc was determined by luciferase activity in infected BHK-21 cells on 24-well plates. Recombinant VSV-eGFP was determined for GFP expression under a fluorescence microscope.",

The sera\u2019s neutralizing activity was determined by incubating the pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses with the sera and monitoring the inhibition of the infectivity of these pseudotyped viruses, as described [28]. Briefly, HIV-1 luciferase reporter viruses (pNL4-3.Luc.R\u2212E\u2212) pseudotyped with HIV-1 HXB2, JRFL envelope protein were incubated with the sera at dilutions of 1:30, 1:60, and 1:120 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and then used to infect U87-CD4-CCR5 (JRFL) and U87-CD4_CXCR4 (HXB2) cells on the microplate wells (96-well flat bottom). HIV-1 pseudotyped luciferase reporter viruses without anti-serum treatment were included as controls. HIV-1-infected cells were allowed to incubate for 2 more days and then lysed. The luciferase activity was assayed using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madision, WI) and a Wallac Microbetta 1420 Counter (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA). The neutralizing activity of the mouse sera against SARS-CoV was used as a control for the serum specificity using a similar assay [29]. In addition, each immune serum sample was compared to the serum of given mice before immunization to test nonspecific neutralization activity. Each neutralizing experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. The neutralizing ability of the sera from each group was calculated by subtracting the mean luminescence in cells infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses with serum treatment from that in cells infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses without serum treatment and expressed as a fraction of that in cells infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses without sera treatment. As the negative control, the reactivity of the immunized sera with SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus expressed by the infected rate; this was calculated by the mean luminescence of cells infected by SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus treated with immunized sera divided by the mean luminescence of cells infected by SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus without sera treatment.",

The immunization of mice with recombinant VSVs expressing various HIV-1 envelope or HIV-1 envelope mutations and detection of neutralizing ability to HIV-1 isolates in a standard assay panel [33] serve as an effective and rapid alternative approaches to determine better immunogens for eliciting neutralizing antibodies.

            "text": "One of the advantages of the rVSV vector is the high titer of recombinant VSVs [27]. In our experiments, the recombinant VSVs expressing HIV-1 gp120, luc, and eGFP recovered by passage on BHK-21 cells 3 times have been determined by plaque assay. The titers were 1.2 \u00d7 108, 1.5 \u00d7 108, and 2.7 \u00d7 108\n pfu/ml, respectively, the titer being lower than those of recovered wild-type VSVs which were 4.5 \u00d7 108\n pfu/ml, but they are within the same range. Another advantage of VSV-based vector is that recombinant VSVs can stimulate strong cellular and humoral immune responses [19], [20]. Recombinant VSVs expressing HIV-1 gag and envelope proteins can form virus like particles and induce high level CTL responses against HIV-1 gag and envelope [34], [35]. In our experiments, the intranasal inoculation with recombinant VSV expressing HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 only once can induce antibodies binding HIV-1 envelope protein expressed on the 293T cell surface. The anti-sera of mice could neutralize HIV-1 HXB2 and JRFL pseudotyped HIV-1 reporter viruses. The titer neutralizing HXB2 measured as IC50 is about 1:120 and the titer neutralizing JRFL is about 1:30. All the sera specifically inhibit HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped viruses since they cannot inhibit SARS-CoV spike pseudotyped virus entry host cells. This neutralizing titer is at the same range as DNA immunization results of modified HIV-1 gp120 or gp140 by adding three copies of C3d as molecular adjust. The DNA immunization needs boost DNA twice after the first immunization or boosted with protein after two times DNA immunization, so it requires at least 4 months to develop neutralizing antibodies [36], [37]. After recombinant VSV immunization, there were detectable neutralizing antibodies at 4 weeks and peaked at 5 weeks. This short time of maturation of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies makes this method very convenient for evaluating HIV-1 envelope protein\u2019s immunogenicity.",

As shown in Fig. 2, the gp120 expression can be identified by Western blot on the cell lyses and by FACS analysis with HIV-1 mAb b12, 2G12. These data confirmed that the modified gp120 on the cell surface kept the na\u00efve conformations which may be important for inducing HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Although we detected the expression of gp120 in the infected cells, but there were no detectable gp120 on the recombinant virions. We pelleted the viruses and compared the viral protein expression within the recombinant viruses. We found that all recombinant VSV virions expressed the L, N/P, and M protein at similar levels to those of wild VSVs on a Coomassie-stained SDS\u2013PAGE (data not show). However, we were not able to detect the presence of HIV-1 gp120 within the recombinant VSV virions. This result is consistent with previous data [34] that rVSVs expressing HIV-1 89.6 gp160 envelope at high level (30% of that of VSV G protein), but much lower gp160 (about 3% of VSV G protein level) was incorporated into recombinant VSV virions. The lower level of inoculation of HIV-1 envelope protein is quite different when compared with other foreign proteins expressed by rVSVs. As described previously, CD4 protein, measles virus hemagglutinin are both effectively incorporated into virions [27]. The lower incorporation may be due to the intracellular retention and degradation of HIV-1 envelope before it reaches the cell surface [34], [38]. To further enhance the immunogenicity of HIV-1 envelope protein expressed by rVSVs, new recombinant VSV vectors encoding costimulatory molecules and cytokines or by expressing HIV-1 envelope protein covalently linked to C3d will be developed and tested. With these improvements on VSV vector, the HIV-1 envelope antigen will be more effectively presented and easy to immunize. In addition, the neutralizing antibodies can be detected within a shorter time. The recombinant VSVs expressing HIV-1 envelope and envelope mutations will make a high-throughput comparison possible.",
