The broad-spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin [8], protease inhibitor lopinavir and ritonavir [9,10] and immune up-regulator interferon [11,12] were most commonly used. In addition, in vitro or in vivo studies have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [13,14], remdesivir [15] and arbidol [16] are effective in inhibiting viral replication in SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV), MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections [17].

In subgroup analysis, the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids remarkably decreased mortality (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.68). Besides, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and interferon, ribavirin, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and corticosteroids, showed tendency of lower mortality. On the contrary, the combination of interferon and corticosteroid demonstrated higher mortality tendency with no significant difference (Fig. 2\nand Supplementary Fig. 1).",

Recently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (EC50 = 5.47%\u00b5M, EC50 = 0.72%\u00b5M, respectively) [32,43]. The underlying mechanisms were inferred as follows: (1) as weakly alkaline, chloroquine could increase endosomal pH therefore block virus infection [42,44]; (2) as spike (S) protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) blocker, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine interfered with the glycosylation of cellular SARS-CoV receptor thus inhibit virus attacking [4]; (3) as immunomodulant, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could counteract pro-inflammatory cytokine storm in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [28,45]. Unfortunately, the outcomes of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients were inconsistent in SARS-CoV-2 viral eradication. Gautret et al reported that hydroxychloroquine alone or combined with azithromycin observed better ability of SARS-CoV-2 eradication. At day six post-treatment, 100% of patients treated with combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had been virologically cured compared to 57.1% in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone and 12.5% in control group [32]. On the contrary, Chen et al and Tang et al documented that the SARS-CoV-2 eradication rate were equal between hydroxychloroquine and standard care group [37,40]. Therefore, the meta-analysis generated no significant favored outcomes of hydroxychloroquine in virological eradication. The authors speculated the reasons underlying these inconsistent results included (1) unsuitable population selection: mild illness or later stage of COVID-19 might not be target population to assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine; (2) inappropriate endpoints: viral load shedding rather than ICU admission and negative rate of nucleic acid might be more sensitive endpoints; (3) confounding effects: antiviral agents used in standard care group might be confounders to weaken effect of hydroxychloroquine; (4) small sample size of these studies; (5) no valid in vivo evidences despite adequate encouraging in vitro proofs [37,40]. Additionally, the hydroxychloroquine therapy improved more radiographical benefit [28], despite accompanied with more AEs especially diarrhea [40]. Up to date, we could not recommend hydroxychloroquine superior to the standard care of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we need to wait for larger randomized trials with target population and sensitive endpoints to valid the value of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19.",

It was reported lopinavir could inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in vitro with EC50 at 17.1 \u03bcM and 8 \u03bcM respectively [47]. Lopinavir was also found to demonstrated antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with EC50 at 26.1 \u03bcM [48]. Ritonavir had no effect against coronavirus but prolonged bioavailability of lopinavir by inhibiting host's cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme [49]. Five studies had reported the effectiveness and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir alone or combination therapy. Lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with ribavirin and corticosteroids did not show any mortality benefit. However, lopinavir/ritonavir-based treatments had observed inconsistent results of virological clearance with RR of between 0.97-2.93. Lopinavir/ritonavir alone was revealed ineffective in lowering virus load of SARS-CoV-2 [36,38], while the lopinavir/ritonavir accompanying with arbidol or ribavirin augmented the eradication of SARS-CoV-2 [27,35,[47], [48], [49]]. It was speculated that lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg) twice daily may reach the minimal lopinavir serum concentration at 9.4 \u03bcM (7.2\u201312.1 \u03bcM), which was inadequate for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 [50]. Nevertheless, lopinavir/ritonavir accompanied with the other agents showing effects against SARS-CoV-2 might decrease the inhibitory concentration of lopinavir and produce synergy [48]. Furthermore, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapies documented notably better clinical and radiographical improvement and reduced incidence of ARDS or intubation. Take adverse reactions into consideration, most of the AEs rate were comparable between groups. Conversely, lopinavir/ritonavir alone showed tendency of more diarrhea events, while the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and corticosteroids reduced incidence of diarrhea significantly. It was suspected that lopinavir/ritonavir alone did not show demonstrably beneficial effects for COVID-19, but the lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might play roles in the eradication of SARS-CoV-2 [21].",

There were 9 studies reporting SARS and MERS patients treated with ribavirin or combinations with ribavirin. The meta-analysis yielded inconsistent results for mortality with RR of between 0.38 and 0.82, while the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids showed remarkable lower mortality compared with control group. In addition, patients treated with ribavirin-based therapies showed comparable rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation with control group. Of note, the major problem of ribavirin was significantly higher incidence of adverse events especially bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis compared with control group. Intriguingly, the combination of ribavirin and interferon did not observe these problems.

Secondly, the open-label design of most RCTs included in this meta-analysis also restricted the quality grade of effects. Thirdly, the variations in timing of treatment, dosage, administration route and co-treatments might influence our results. For an instance, one study administrated hydroxychloroquine approximately 16 days after symptoms onset, while the time between onset of symptoms and inclusion (hydroxychloroquine initiation) were 0 to 10 days in another study. The virological eradication results were quite difference between these two studies. However, we could not perform further subgroup analysis considering these influenced factors because of the limited number of studies. Finally, the diversity of indications might add heterogeneity to results. Although SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were closely related with SARS-CoV, the results might not be directly extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
