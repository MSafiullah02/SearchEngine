For HBoV, 100 ng of HBoV VP2 VLPs were coated on Nunc-Immuno MediSorp plates (Nunc) in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed 6 times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), and blocked with dilution buffer (PBS containing 2% Tween 20 and 3% FCS) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation with serum samples (1:100 in dilution buffer) was done for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, the plates were washed, and an anti-human IgG-specific, horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Dako Deutschland) (1:6000 in dilution buffer) was added for 1 h at 37\u00b0C.

However, this observation was mainly based on 4 study subjects who exhibited high cytokine responses against the B19V VP2 proteins. These single high responses might be explained by possible recent B19V infections or viral restimulation, because the average seroprevalence of B19V in the German adult population is 77%, and, therefore, acute infections may occur in adults [40].",

This might be the result of an age-related decrease in and an impairment of the amount and functions of virus-specific T cell populations, because it has been described for other viral infections (e.g., for populations with adenovirus) [42]. Furthermore, it is known that active T cell responses against pathogens undergo confinement to specific memory populations with increasing time after primary infection in the absence of exogenous restimulation events or endogenous reactivations of latent viral infections. Because all currently published data on the epidemiologic profile of HBoV strongly suggest that primary infection occurs in the very early years of childhood [9\u201317, 20], the time-dependent reduction in the number of virus-specific T cells might be explained by a lack of frequent pathogen contact. This may be considered to provide additional proof of the early time point when HBoV infection occurs during childhood. Independent of age, female subjects had higher numbers of cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 than did male subjects, especially among younger individuals; this finding possibly indicates more-frequent spontaneous viral restimulation (e.g., by increased contact with children with acute infection), resulting in an overall increase in the HBoV-specific cellular immune response. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the most prominent difference in sex-specific cellular responses was observed in individuals born between 1970 and 1979, an age group in which women presumably have the most frequent contact with small children. However, because no information on the family status of the study subjects is available, these data will have to be confirmed by additional epidemiologic investigations.",
