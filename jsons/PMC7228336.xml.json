Neutrophil\u2010to\u2010lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte\u2010to\u2010C\u2010reactive protein ratio (LCR) are established inflammation markers that reflect systemic inflammatory response,\n3\n, \n4\n and both are available in almost all laboratories. In this study, a meta\u2010analysis was performed to investigate whether NLR and LCR values can help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID\u201019.",

Meta\u2010analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta\u2010Analysis Software version 3 (2013, Biostat, Englewood, NJ) calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the NLR and LCR values in patients with COVID\u201019 with or without severe disease.",
