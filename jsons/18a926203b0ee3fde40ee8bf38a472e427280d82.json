A fairly uniform set of leaves from different plants can be selected, and half-leaves may be used as control material. There are three major disadvantages: i. A typical leaf such as a tobacco leaf with a surface area of 200 cm 2 , for example, contains about 3 \u00d7 10 7 cells. The upper limit for the proportion of epidermal cells that can be infected by mechanical inoculation under the best conditions is not known precisely, but is probably not more than about 10 4 cells per leaf. Thus, at the beginning of an experiment, only about 1 in 10 3 of the cells in the system has been infected. Even for those that are directly infected, the synchrony of infection may not be very sharp, especially if whole virus is used as inoculum. Thus, early replication events in the small proportion of infected cells will probably be diluted out beyond detection by the relatively enormous number of as-yet-uninfected cells. Then, as infection progresses, a mixed population of cells at different stages of infection will be produced. ii. The second major disadvantage of inoculated leaf tissue, at least for studying events over the first few hours, is that mechanical inoculation itself is a severe shock to the leaf, causing changes in respiration, water content, and probably many other things as well, including nucleic acid synthesis. Thus, the use of appropriately treated control leaves is essential. iii. A third difficulty applies to experiments in which radio actively labeled virus is used as inoculum. Most of the virus applied to the leaf does not infect cells, and a substantial but variable proportion cannot be washed off after inoculation. The fate of the infecting particles may well be masked by the mass of potentially infective inoculum remaining on or in the leaf.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "b.

Very limited amounts of tissue can be harvested in this way, but the method increases by a factor of about 8 the proportion of cells infected at time soon after inoculation (Fry and Matthews, 1963) . Dijkstra (1966) explored the possibility of studying TMV replication in strips of epidermis removed from leaves immediately after inoculation with TMV and floated on nutrient solutions or distilled water, but no significant progress has been made with this system. Several workers have used micromanipulation methods to infect single cells on a leaf-usually leaf hair cellsand then to follow events in the living cells as they can be observed by phase or ultraviolet microscopy or in preparations stained with fluorescent antibody (Chapter 10, Section I, B, 5).

Furthermore, the time at which infectious material moves from inoculated leaves to young growth may vary significantly between individual plants in a batch. Nevertheless, it is probable that in young systemically infected leaves (perhaps about 4 cm long at the time virus enter plants, such as tobacco and Chinese cabbage) most of the cells in a leaf become infected over a period of 1\u22122 days.

Under these conditions, systemic infection of the young leaves occurs, but replication does not. When the upper leaves are shifted to a higher temperature, replication begins in a fairly synchronous fashion (Dawson et al., 1975) . This procedure provides a very useful system that complements, in several respects, the study of virus replication in protoplasts, discussed below. The technique uses intact plants, is simple, and can provide substantial amounts of material.

There may be two serious disadvantages: (i) microorganisms grow on the surface of the disks and in the intercellular spaces, so addition of antibiotics may not block all microorganisms and may well alter the biochemical situation in the cells of interest, and (ii) excised disks are not uniform in several ways (Pratt and Matthews, 1971) . First, there is a \"geographical\" gradient from the cut edge to the center of the piece of tissue. Differences involve the uptake of labeled precursors and their utilization for nucleic acid synthesis. Second, excised tissues change with time in a complex fashion in their ability to accumulate substances from the medium. There may be a differential accumulation of labeled precursors in the cut ends of veins. Third, further variables are introduced when the excised tissue is treated with a drug like actinomycin D, which may be distributed very unevenly in the tissue.

Amounts of virus produced in cultured tissue or cells are usually very much less than in intact green leaves, although tobacco callus cells disrupted in the presence of TMV inoculum produced high yields of virus (Murakishi et al., 1971; Pelcher et al., 1972) .

The two clones are introduced into a suitable yeast line and interaction between the bait and prey proteins tether the DBD to the AD allowing the activation of a downstream reporter (e.g., lacZ, HIS3, LEU2, or URA3); the basic system and some variations are illustrated in Figure 7 .4.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 40, "end": 66, "text": "Brachmann and Boeke, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 67, "end": 86, "text": "Suter et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF490"}, {"start": 87, "end": 100, "text": "Fields, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 653, "end": 661, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}], "section": "Protein-Protein Interactions"}, {"text": "Proteins can be cross-linked to one another or to nucleic acids by treatment with chemicals or by UV radiation (see Ausubel et al., 1998 for details) .

Plants use this mechanism as a major antiviral strategy, but viruses have means of avoiding or delaying recognition by host surveillance due to the formation of replicase complexes hidden in host membranes and by expressing suppressors of RNA silencing (Chapter 9). Thus, any effects of DI RNAs leading to a reduction of RNA silencing suppressors are likely to lead to enhanced symptoms . To complicate the situation, a DI RNA may also be the target of RNA silencing if it produces enough dsRNA target. If it does not, the parent virus RNA would be targeted but not the DI RNA (Zhong et al., 2005; Hornyik et al., 2006) . Graves et al., 1996) The DI RNA of BBMV is derived from, and decreases the concentration of, RNA2. Even though it decreases the concentration of RNA2, it exacerbates the severity of BBMV symptoms in some hosts. For instance, the presence of the DI RNA causes symptoms to appear earlier and to be more severe, especially in Pisum sativum cv Rondo where it is lethal (Romero et al., 1993) . In broad bean (Vicia faba), yield loss due to BBMV with DI RNA is up to 65% compared with about 40% loss in the absence of DI RNA (Sandoval et al., 2007) .

The DI RNAs retained the 5\u2032-terminal 1152 nucleotides and the 3\u2032-terminal 468 nucleotides; (ii) the overall size. The sizes of the deleted sequences are between 15% and 30% that of the wild-type RNA2; (iii) the coding capacity. The DI RNA retains a deleted form of the 2a ORF that comprises at least 79% of the molecule. BBMV DI RNAs do not accumulate and are not encapsidated in local lesion hosts or in some systemic hosts (Romero et al., 1993) . D RNAs have been reported for BMV in which there were one or two deletions in the 3a ORF of RNA3 (Figure 7 .17B) (Damayanti et al., 1999; Sandoval et al., 2008) . No D RNAs were found in CCMV (Sandoval et al, 2008) . (reviewed by Graves et al., 1996) Various D RNAs have been found associated with CMV (Graves and Roossinck, 1995a; Lopez et al., 2007; Takeshita et al., 2008) . Most, if not all, are derived from RNA3 and have no apparent effect on either symptom production or on virus accumulation. An example is the D RNA derived by a single deletion that removes a segment of the 3a ORF (Figure 7 .17A) while maintaining the reading frame downstream of the deletion (Graves and Roossinck, 1995a) . This leaves a defective cell-to-cell movement protein and a functional CP. CMV D RNAs accumulate in various Nicotiana species, but in tomato, zucchini squash, and muskmelon the D RNAs only accumulate in inoculated tissue and do not move systemically (Graves and Roossinck, 1995b) . Furthermore, the D RNAs accumulate and are encapsidated in both inoculated cotyledons and leaves of tomato and zucchini squash and accumulate but are not encapsidated only in the inoculated cotyledons of muskmelon. This indicates that host and tissue specificity is involved in replication, cell-to-cell movement, systemic movement, and encapsidation of CMV D RNAs. (reviewed by White and Morris, 1999; Simon et al., 2004; Pathak and Nagy, 2009) Some of the earliest reports of DI RNAs came from work on tombusviruses. Hillman et al. (1987) and Morris and Hillman (1989) described an abnormal RNA from a culture of TBSV that met all the criteria for a DI RNA. The RNA was about 396 nucleotides long and was derived from the genomic RNA by six internal deletions, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences being conserved. Two of the deletions were large (1180 and 3000 nucleotides) while the others were much smaller. Co-inoculation of the small RNA with parent virus depressed virus synthesis in whole plants and attenuated disease symptoms. Although the DI RNA could represent 60% of virus-specific RNA in leaf extracts, only about 3\u22124% of the encapsidated RNA was DI RNA. Experiments in protoplasts showed that the DI RNA suppresses replication of genomic TBSV RNA (Jones et al., 1990) . A similar DI RNA was described from a culture of CymRSV (Burgy\u00e1n et al., 1989) . DI RNAs have been found in several other tombusviruses including CIRV and CNV. These naturally occurring DI RNAs (400-800 nucleotides) are about 10-20% of the size of the parent genomes and are composed of conserved non-contiguous segments of the genome that accumulate de novo after serial passage of the parent virus at high multiplicity of infection. They suppress the accumulation of the parent virus and usually attenuate the severe symptoms that these viruses normally induce.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 580, "end": 601, "text": "(Romero et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF421"}, {"start": 717, "end": 741, "text": "(Damayanti et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 742, "end": 764, "text": "Sandoval et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF428"}, {"start": 796, "end": 818, "text": "(Sandoval et al, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF428"}, {"start": 821, "end": 854, "text": "(reviewed by Graves et al., 1996)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 906, "end": 935, "text": "(Graves and Roossinck, 1995a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 936, "end": 955, "text": "Lopez et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF296"}, {"start": 956, "end": 979, "text": "Takeshita et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF499"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1303, "text": "(Graves and Roossinck, 1995a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1585, "text": "(Graves and Roossinck, 1995b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1990, "text": "and Morris, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF551"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 2010, "text": "Simon et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF461"}, {"start": 2011, "end": 2033, "text": "Pathak and Nagy, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF384"}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2128, "text": "Hillman et al.

Following translation of the vmRNAs, the viral proteins involved in replication accumulate in the viroplasm. Viral glycoproteins are targeted to cytoplasmic membranes or, possibly, the outer nuclear envelope (ONE). Maturation of cytorhabdoviruses takes place via matrix protein-mediated condensation of cores at sites of G protein accumulation in the ER.

Following transcription and export, vmRNAs are translated and viral proteins are imported into the nucleus, where they participate in replication and formation of large viroplasms.

The replicase-driven template switching model involves four elements, three RNAs [the primary RNA template (donor strand), the strand synthesized from the primary strand (nascent strand), and the acceptor strand], and the replicase complex (Figure 7 .31B). Synthesis of the nascent strand on the donor strand is halted or slowed temporarily which enables either the RdRp or nascent strand to interact with the acceptor strand leading to template switching. Thus, there are two types of signal on the donor or nascent strand, one (pausing or arrest signal) that halts the RdRp but from which it can escape and the other (terminator signal) that releases the RdRp from the RNAs. It is thought that these signals may be similar to those involved in template switching by DNA-dependent DNA polymerases and RT and to be the sequence and/or secondary structure of the donor or nascent RNA. These regions that promote RdRp pausing or termination will constitute recombination hotspots. To enable template switching, the RdRp must be able to bind to the acceptor RNA and use the 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA as a primer to reinitiate RNA synthesis. Little is known about the actual mechanism of the switching of template by the RdRp though there are several models. In the processive model, it is suggested that when the RdRp approaches the heteroduplex region it pauses and either switches to the acceptor sequence or slides backwards 10-20 nucleotides enabling the nascent strand to hybridize to the acceptor strand. In the non-processive model, the RdRp is suggested to dissociate from the donor strand and then reassociates with the nascent and acceptor RNAs. ii. The RNA breakage and ligation model is similar to the well-characterized DNA breakage and ligation system. It has not been formally demonstrated for RNA recombination. iii.

These sites comprise a 10-to 30-nt-long inverted repeat sequence capable of forming a hairpin structure that contains within its loop a highly conserved nonanucleotide sequence that defines the actual replication origin. Recombination experiments in geminiviruses (Stenger et al., 1994) have shown that this genome site is a mechanistically predisposed recombination hot spot because of the replicational release of viral genomes from genomic concatomers. When these concatomers either arise following a copy-choice mediated polymerase strand switch or break and are rescued by host double-stranded break repair pathways (i.e., by RDR), recombinants that are replicationally released will have one breakpoint at the site of the strand switch/breakage and another at the origin. -Sequence similarity. The efficiency with which HR can be used to replicationally repair broken ss and dsDNA molecules is strongly dependent on the degrees of similarity between broken sites and those of the unbroken molecules used as templates during recombinational repair. Recombination in geminiviruses tends to occur more frequently at genome sites where the two parental genomes share between 5 and 14 identical nucleotides than at sites where they share longer runs of identical sequence; recombination can also occur at quite a low frequency between two nucleotides that are nonidentical in both parents (Garcia-Andres et al., 2007) . -ssDNA secondary structure. As noted above the geminivirus replication origin is a recombination hotspot and forms a stable hair-loop structure. Computational predictions indicate that additional uncharacterized ssDNA structures probably exist within many ssDNA virus genomes (Garcia-Andres et al., 2007) and the possibility exists that these too may facilitate recombination. Although the overall genomic secondary structures of recombinant genomes can vary quite substantially from those of their parents, there is evidence of strong selection pressures in geminiviruses for recombinants to maintain parent-like secondary structures (Martin et al., 2011b) . -Transcription-replication clashes. Geminivirus genes are expressed from both the virion and complementary sense strands. The complementary sense genes are transcribed in the opposite direction to RCR leading to the possibility for replication complex-transcription complex clashes. Geminiviruses tend to have more detectable recombination events and measurably higher estimated population-scaled recombination rates in their complementary sense genes than they do in their virion sense genes (Martin et al., 2011a) . The imbalance between recombination rates in the virion and complementary sense genes is particularly apparent when considering only recombination occurring between very closely related sequences suggesting that strongly homology dependent copy-choice recombination may be a particularly important mechanism of replication re-initiation following interruption due to transcription-replication complex clashes. -Differential degrees of ssDNA exposure within minichromosomes. Transcriptionally active geminiviral covalently ccDNA forms associate with host histones forming minichromosomes (Pilartz and Jeske, 2003) . Recombination breakpoint hot spots in begomovirus genomes co-localize very closely with genome sites that are exposed within minichromosomes to host transcription and replication factors. These sites are also apparently the most common sites of dsDNA breakage during begomovirus infections (Jeske et al., 2001) and it is therefore likely that at least part of the reason that these regions are recombination hot spots is that they are hypersensitive to either physical breakage or host nuclease attack.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 111, "text": "(Lefeuvre et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 378, "end": 400, "text": "(Stenger et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF480"}, {"start": 1504, "end": 1532, "text": "(Garcia-Andres et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1839, "text": "(Garcia-Andres et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2192, "text": "(Martin et al., 2011b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF307"}, {"start": 2688, "end": 2710, "text": "(Martin et al., 2011a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 3300, "end": 3325, "text": "(Pilartz and Jeske, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF391"}, {"start": 3618, "end": 3638, "text": "(Jeske et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "i.

The replication of viruses, such as BSV and TVCV, is episomal, and the integration of the viral sequences into the host genome only supplies the inoculum and is not an integral part of the replication mechanism.
