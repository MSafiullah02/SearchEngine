In the U.S. in 2003\u20132005, the estimated indirect and direct impact of hospitalizations due to hRSV infections was $650 million (Palmer et al., 2010). Infants, immune-compromised children, or those with underlying respiratory disorders have a significantly higher risk of developing severe hRSV infections that can be complicated by opportunistic viral pneumonia and respiratory distress. Elderly and immune-compromised individuals are also susceptible to complications from hRSV infections, thereby highlighting the importance of medical intervention in the form of prophylactic and antiviral therapies (Byrd and Prince, 1997).",

These are NS1 and NS2, which inhibit type I interferon activity; N, which is the nucleocapsid protein; M, which encodes the matrix protein; and SH, G and F (fusion) proteins, which are incorporated into the viral coat. The G protein is a post-translationally glycosylated surface protein and also recognizes cell surface components (e.g., heparin) during viral attachment. The F protein mediates entry of the virus into the cell cytoplasm and also promotes the formation of syncytia. Typically, antibodies directed at the F protein are neutralizing because this protein is conserved in both subtypes of RSV, while the G protein varies in sequence considerably between hRSV A and B subtypes. The M2 gene encodes the elongation factor M2-1 and transcription factor M2-2. The L gene encodes the viral RNA polymerase, and the phosphoprotein P, which is a cofactor for L function (Olszewska and Openshaw, 2009).",

We identified and characterized a series of compounds that inhibit hRSV replication in vitro. We developed a mutant virus with resistance to the lead inhibitor compound, sequenced the mutant virus, and identified mutations in the N-terminus of the viral G protein that implicated the G protein as the target of compound inhibition. Further experiments with multiple cell lines (A549 and Vero E6) indicated that the lead compound was most effective in cell lines express a high percentage of full-length G protein and again suggested that the compound target was the viral G protein. However, in vivo studies with the lead compound did not reduce viral titers or extend the lives of cotton rats in a lethal hRSV challenge model. Our data suggest that, while targeting the function of G protein with small molecule inhibitors effectively inhibits hRSV replication in vitro, this strategy is cell type-dependent and may not be viable for therapeutic intervention in vivo.",

Body weight was recorded at end of experiment (day +4), and animal body weight and sex distribution was selected so as to be as similar as possible across all groups at the start. RSV/A/Tracy (passage three grown in HEp-2 cells), 1.35 \u00d7 105 PFU intranasally (100 \u03bcL) to cotton rats lightly anesthetized with isoflurane. Stock virus concentration was 1.35 \u00d7 106 PFU/mL. Compound SRI 29365 (140 mg, Chembridge, San Diego, CA) was supplied as dry powder and was diluted in 7 mL of PBS (20 mg/mL). The preparation was vortexed and sonicated in a water bath until the solution appeared clear. After 30 min of sonication the solution had the appearance of an emulsion. The emulsion was used for the IP injections. All aliquots were stored at 4 \u00b0C. Dose volume was 2 mL/kg (0.2 mL/0.1 kg cotton rat). Plaque assays were performed using 24-well tissue cultures plates containing nearly confluent monolayers (20\u201340 \u00d7 104 cells/well) of HEp-2 cells prepared in 10% FBS 24 h prior to start of assay. At the start of each assay, dilutions (usually serial log10) were made of the test samples. A 0.2 mL sample of each was added to wells in duplicate and allowed to adsorb for 90 min with occasional gentle agitation. After the inoculum was removed, the monolayers were overlayed with 0.75% methylcellulose in 2% FBS-MEM containing antibiotics, vitamins and other nutrients. Tissue culture and positive virus controls were included in each assay. The plates were placed in a 36 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator. On day 7, plates were stained with 0.01% crystal violet/10% formalin solution (1.5 mL/well) and allowed to sit for 24\u201348 h at room temperature. Wells were rinsed with water, and the visible plaques were counted. All of the plaques in wells containing between 20 and 100 plaques were enumerated, averaged and the virus titers calculated as total log10 PFU for nasal wash fluid or log10 PFU/g of tissue for lungs. The lower limit of detection by this method is 0.70 log10 total PFU or approximately 1.4 log10 PFU/g of lung, respectively.",

Compound 1 had the greatest potency (lowest EC50 and highest SI), indicating that a thiofuran at the R2 position is more potent than when a furan (Compound 2, SRI-29365) is substituted.

This resistant virus was plaque purified and amplified in HEp-2 cells in the presence of 5 \u03bcM SRI 29365 for characterization. However, titration experiments with the resistant virus did not establish an EC50 for SRI-29365 (Fig. 1C). This is likely because the resistant mutant virus is >100-fold resistant to the wt virus EC50 concentration of SRI 29365. Because the selectivity of the SRI 29365 is <100 (83), the compound-induced CC50 is below the EC50 value for the mutant virus. However, because of the high resistance of the mutant hRSV, this virus was sub-cultured and amplified in the presence of 5 \u03bcM of SRI 29365, and a stock of the virus was prepared and stored. The viral RNA in 1 mL of the amplified mutant virus culture was isolated and cDNA was reverse-transcribed using hRSV-specific primers. The complete mutant virus genome was sequenced twice and a mutation was identified in the viral G protein gene that suggested that the antiviral mechanism of SRI 29365 was associated with hRSV G protein function. Fig. 3\nA and B depict the regions of the viral G protein genetic sequence that contains the mutation and location of the mutation in the primary protein domain structure of the viral G protein. Even after multiple passages under compound selection, a mixed population of wt and mutant was observed in the G protein genetic sequence, but the virus was still >100-fold more resistant to SRI 29365 than the wt hRSV. The mutation (A63V) occurs in the N-terminal region of the G protein within the transmembrane domain. Fig. 3D shows the extended amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domain surrounding the point mutation. The region containing the mutation is conserved in both RSVA strain Long and RSVA strain Tracy (used for in vivo studies described below), but not in RSVB. SRI 29365 was not tested against RSVB.",

            "text": "The viral G protein mediates virus attachment by binding heparin molecules that are expressed on the cell surface (Krusat and Streckert, 1997), and requires full-length G protein to do so efficiently. It has been previously shown that the virus-associated expression of full-length G protein in cell culture is a factor of cell type (Kwilas et al., 2009). Viral replication in HEp-2 cells results in expression of full-length G protein (90 kDa), whereas replication in A549 cells or Vero E6 cells results in the expression of a truncated G protein (45\u201355 kDa) that is missing the C-terminus. Replication of hRSV in HEp-2 cells is dependent on the binding of G protein to cell surface heparin glycosaminoglycans. However, replication in A549 cells or Vero cells produces hRSV that infects cells by a heparin-independent mechanism, most likely because the truncated G protein does not contain a fully functional heparin binding domain (Kwilas et al., 2009). We used this cell-dependent difference in expressed G protein length to measure the antiviral efficacy of SRI 29365 in the three different cell types to determine if the compound was more effective against hRSV with full-length G protein. All three cell types were infected with the wild-type or the SRI 29365-resistant hRSV mutant in the presence of 5 \u03bcM SRI 29365, and the reduction in virus (TCID50 reduction assay) was determined. Fig. 4\nshows the compound-mediated reduction in viral titers for both wt and mutant virus in HEp-2, A549, and Vero E6 cells, relative to infected (- compound) controls. Against wt hRSV, the compound reduced virus TCID50 values by 300-fold (P < 0.003), but only 10-fold (P < 0.0005) in A549 cells, and less than 10-fold (P < 0.00001) in Vero E6 cells. The antiviral activity of SRI 29365 against wt hRSV is cell-type specific and strongly correlates with the expression of full-length G protein, implicating the G protein as the compound target. Against the mutant hRSV, the compound reduced virus TCID50 values by less than 10-fold in all cell types. Furthermore, in the presence of SRI 29365, a 2.0 log reduction in wt hRSV titer v. 0.5 log reduction in compound-resistant hRSV titer was observed in HEp-2 cells. However, SRI-29365 reduced titers of both viruses less than 0.5 log in Vero E6 cells, indicating that the compound has little effect on either wt or mutant virus titers when a truncated G protein is expressed.",

We established compound EC50 and selectivity and used chemical analogs of SRI 29365 to determine structure activity relationships. Using in vitro assays, SRI 29365 was not effective against other RNA viruses. Time-of-addition experiments indicated that SRI 29365 reduced hRSV-induced CPE only if added within 2 h of virus infection, suggesting that it inhibited an early virus replication step. A hRSV mutant that was resistant to inhibition by the compound was isolated and sequenced, and a mutation was identified in the sequence of the viral G protein, implicating the G protein as the putative target of inhibition. In vitro characterization of both the wt and mutant viruses in cell types that express either full-length or truncated G protein suggested that SRI 29365 inhibits viral G protein function. Lastly, an in vivo study was performed to determine the effectiveness of the compound at reducing hRSV titers in a challenged cotton rats, but SRI 29365 was largely insoluble in the chosen dose formulation and was not effective at reducing hRSV titers or pathology in the animal model.",

            "text": "The specific cell surface receptors used for infection by hRSVs are not known, but cell surface glycosaminoglycans, and in particular heparan sulfates, have been shown to be important for infection (Schlender et al., 2003). The hRSV G protein, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein and is the major hRSV attachment protein (Kauvar et al., 2010). The role of the nominal attachment protein G is confined to facilitating infection in a non-species-specific manner, most probably by binding to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (Kauvar et al., 2010). It contains a single hydrophobic region which serves as a signal peptide and also as a membrane anchor. The RSV G protein is also an important contributor to the disease process. A conserved CX3C chemokine like motif in G likely contributes to the pathogenesis of disease (Harcourt et al., 2006). The G protein is evolutionarily conserved in all strains of RSV and has a central conserved cysteine noose region that contains a CX3C chemokine motif at amino acid positions 182\u2013186 (Harcourt et al., 2006). Through this motif G protein binds to CX3CR1 present on various immune cells and affects immune responses to hRSV, as has been shown in a mouse model of RSV infection. However, very little is known of the role of the RSV CX3C\u2013CX3CR1 interactions in human disease. Reports suggest that the hRSV G protein CX3C motif impairs innate and adaptive human immune responses and may be important to vaccine and antiviral drug development. (Chirkova et al., 2013). Lastly vaccination with this CX3C motif induces a protective immune response in mice (Jorquera et al., 2013).",

            "text": "We identified a compound that inhibits viral replication by the putative mechanism of interfering with the function the viral G protein. Since G protein binds to cell surface heparin molecules during virus attachment, one possible mechanism of SRI 29365 action is inhibition of G protein-mediated heparin binding. We demonstrated that the antiviral efficacy of the test compound SRI 29365 against wt hRSV is significantly reduced in a cell type (i.e., Vero E6) that expresses a truncated G protein that is not dependent on heparin binding for infection. We also showed that, in the presence of SRI 29365, the phenotypes of the wt and mutant hRSVs are different in HEp-2 cells, but similar in Vero E6 cells, suggesting that the truncation of the G protein (and possibly the loss of the heparin-binding domain) is linked to compound mechanism of action. Although hRSV primarily infects cells through heparin binding domains on the G protein, mutant or knockout viruses lacking the G gene do still infect cells and replicate in vitro and in vivo presumably by attachment through redundant heparin binding domains on the F protein (Karron et al., 1997). This observation was reciprocated by in vivo studies of SRI 29365, as SRI-29365 did not significantly reduce hRSV titers or pathology in a cotton rat infection model. Overall, this compound serves as an excellent in vitro inhibitor of hRSV replication, but it was not effective in vivo against RSVA strain Tracy. Since the A63 residue is conserved in both the RSVA Long and Tracy strains, it is expected that this compound would be effective against RSVA Tracy. The lack of in vivo confirmation of in vitro activity may be a result of compound formulation, or may be indicative that the viral G protein function is not a valid drug target for small molecule therapy. This might be due to the above stated observation that hRSV G protein knockout viruses still infect with sufficient efficacy to support robust virus replication. Lastly, residue A63 is not conserved in both A and B strains. In RSVB, residue 63 is an isoleucine, and it is unclear whether it would be susceptible to inhibition by SRI-29365 from the sequence alone.",
