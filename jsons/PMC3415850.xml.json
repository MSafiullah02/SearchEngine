The research agenda within the influenza field was discussed with a broad range of experts at meetings coordinated by agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the recent past. The need for more information on viral factors that affect transmission and contribute to the emergence of pandemic viruses was highlighted in the \u201cReport of the Blue Ribbon Panel on In\ufb02uenza Research, September 11\u201312, 2006\u201d [8], the conclusions of the FAO\u2013World Organization for Animal Health\u2013WHO Joint Technical Consultation on avian influenza at the human-animal interface, held in Verona, Italy, during 7\u20139 October 2008 [9], and the \u201cWHO Public Health Research Agenda for In\ufb02uenza, 2009\u201d [10]. Subsequently, funding agencies published requests for proposals to specifically address these issues [11, 12] or considered funding such work through open competitive grant programs. Proposals were then peer reviewed, and the most competitive proposals were funded. At that stage, the need to perform this particular line of research was clearly agreed upon by the research field as a whole, the scientists proposing the work, the funding agencies, and the external reviewers. From the conception phase of the research onward, biosafety and biosecurity experts were consulted to provide assurance that facilities and working conditions were such that the safety and security could be ensured at all times [13].",

In most countries, such work is performed in enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities. A/H5N1 and other influenza viruses have not escaped from the laboratories in which such research has been performed. Although individual (unreported) laboratory-acquired infections may have occurred, this is in sharp contrast to the scenario discussed by Klotz and Sylvester [14], who concluded that 1% is the estimated probability of an escape from a single lab in a single year. This percentage was calculated on the basis of documented escapes of SARS coronavirus from laboratories that did not adhere to the BSL3 standards that are used in most countries. Research on class 3 pathogens, including transmissible HPAI A/H5N1 virus, can be done safely under enhanced BSL3 conditions by well-trained laboratory professionals, using strictly defined biosecurity and biosafety regulations to protect the researchers, the environment, and the public.",

All of these options are in place at our facilities. First, H5 vaccines are offered to personnel handling the virus. Second, antiviral drugs are available for use as effective postexposure prophylaxis. Third, personnel can be quarantined upon exposure. Thus, despite the minute risk of occupational exposure, which is inherent to this type of work and perhaps unavoidable because of human error, the risks for the public and the environment can be reduced to nearly zero.",

Serious limitations of these animal studies are that virulence in animals and humans may be different, that virulence may vary with the route and dose of virus inoculation, and that virulence may be strain dependent. Overall, it is our opinion that data from human cases, serological analyses, and animal studies indicate that the case-fatality rate of 60% is a vast overestimate. Additional work to provide better estimates is urgently needed.",

The possibility to do harm with this virus is probably low in terms of its transmission and virulence in humans, because it is unlikely that the virus would spread like a seasonal influenza virus in humans and because the case-fatality rate is likely much lower than currently estimated. The techniques that we used to create airborne A/H5N1 virus are not new and can be found in many virology textbooks. Individuals with bad intentions do not need to read the details in our manuscript because the methods for creating similar viruses have already been published widely. Moreover, the generation of such a virus requires well-trained experts and high-tech research techniques and facilities. In addition, there are many easier and cheaper ways for people with bad intentions to create a climate of fear by using infectious agents collected directly from nature.",

Research aiming to unravel the genetic fingerprints associated with virus virulence, fitness, host range, and transmission needs to be done to enhance preparation for newly emerging infectious diseases. We agree with Peter Palese [20] that the more danger a pathogen poses, the more important it is to study it. As a consequence of our work, strong advice may be given to A/H5N1-affected countries about how to eradicate the virus from its animal reservoirs. Surveillance programs in countries where A/H5N1 is enzootic can now specifically target particular mutations that render A/H5N1 transmissible. In addition, we now have a relevant virus that can be used to test the efficacy of existing antivirals and to evaluate prepandemic vaccines. For the longer term, research of this and similar viruses will help us increase our fundamental understanding of why and how influenza viruses acquire the ability of aerosol transmission.",

To provide time to better explain the benefits of this essential research and to explain the measures taken to minimize its possible risks, the influenza research community agreed to a voluntary pause of 60 days on any research resulting in A/H5N1 viruses that are more transmissible in mammals [21]. During the WHO-coordinated technical consultation in mid-February 2012 on H5N1 virus transmission research, unanimous support was given for this type of research, in the interest of science and public health. It was advised that the competent authorities should re-review biosafety and biosecurity conditions required to perform this work. At the same time, there should be focused communications to reduce anxiety among the public, increase awareness of the significance of this work, reassure that this type of work can be done safely and securely, and explain why the details of the work need to be published. It was further concluded that hiding key details from publications does not serve science or public health and that the confidential sharing of data classified as \u201cdual use of concern\u201d is impossible within a relevant time frame. As a consequence, the consensus view of the participants of this meeting was that full details of the studies should be published, in the interest of science and public health. After the expert judgments by the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity and the WHO-assembled technical group, there is clearly also a need for broader consultation. We trust that in the interest of public health, the outcomes will be positive and constructive; that is, that the work will continue and that the manuscripts will be published responsibly, in the very near future.",
