            "text": "The innate immune system is a key component of antiviral defense [1,2]. Danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or alarmins [[3], [4], [5]] plays an important role in innate immunity. DAMPs are intracellular molecules that primarily regulate cell homeostasis, but also act as extracellularly when secreted by activated or damaged cells. The DAMPs interact with Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and initiate the production of cytokines and chemokines, which further amplify the inflammation [[6], [7], [8], [9]]. However, there is very little known about the role of DAMPs in inflammation or immunity during virus infection. A one protein family of DAMPs, known as S100 (i.e., S100A7, S100A15 [6], S100A12, S100A8, and S100A9) [[7], [8], [9]] have shown a direct effect on the innate immune system. The protein S100A9 initiates the immune response through the TLR4/MyD88 pathway [10]. S100A9 is expressed by a variety of cell types including neutrophils, dendritic cells, monocytes and endothelial cells [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. Activation of TLR4/MyD88 pathway by S100A9 triggers the downstream signaling cascade, leading to the activation of nuclear factor-\u043aB (NF-\u043aB), and subsequently activates type 1 interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) [7,9].",

            "text": "BVDV belongs to the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It an immunosuppressive virus and one of the major threats to the cattle industry worldwide [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. BVDV has a positive sense single stranded RNA genome with the size of 12.3 Kb [19]. The genome is translated into a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes approximately 4000 codons comprising 10 to 11 posttranslational cleaved proteins [17,19]. The polyprotein is cleaved into 4 structural proteins [e.g. Erns, envelope proteins E1, E2, and capsid protein (C)] and 7 to 8 nonstructural proteins (e.g. Npro, p7, NS2-3 or NS2 and NS3, NS4A NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) by viral or/and host cell proteases [17,19,20]. The Flaviviridae family also includes Flavivirus and Hepacivirus genus. The Flavivirus genus has viruses with zoonotic importance, such as West Nile virus and dengue virus while Hepacivirus genus comprised solely of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [21,22]. Of the three Flaviviridae genuses, the Pestivirus genome is unique because it encodes two proteins (e.g. Npro and Erns) that are not present in the other genus in Flaviviridae family [23]. Npro is the first protein coded in the ORF, which has protease activity, but is not necessary for viral replication [24,25]. Npro interferes with the innate immune mechanisms through inhibiting type one interferon (e.g. interferon alpha and beta: FN-\u03b1/\u03b2) in cell culture [23,26,27]. This inhibition is potentially associated with the immunotolerance and development of persistent infection (PI) in BVDV infection [25].",

            "text": "Studies with Npro deleted classical swine fever virus demonstrated that Npro is not required for viral replication in cell culture [25] while deletion facilitated the induction of type one IFN [26,27]. Vaccination with Npro deleted virus induced a strong antibody response with significantly increased protection against highly virulent CSFV [25,28]. Similarly, a BVDV virus with mutations in both the Npro protease coding sequence as well as the Erns RNase region, failed to induce PI in calves [29]. The Npro potentially reduces type I IFN by decreasing interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3). The phosphorylation of IRF-3 resulted in its conformational change with increased binding ability to DNA. Phosphorylated IRF-3 binding to DNA up-regulated the IRF-3 transcriptional as well as interferon (IFN)-responsive genes to produce type I IFN [30,31]. While, BVDV Npro decreased the IRF-3 level via proteasomal degradation, leading to decreased expression of type I IFN [32,33].",

The obtained RNA was used as a template to create Npro complementary DNA (cDNA).

Both PRRs use independent downstream pathways [13]. When TLRs are stimulated by alarmins (i.e., PAMPs and DAMPs), they recruit one or more adapter proteins, such as MyD88 (a downstream signaling protein). Activated MyD88 further activates signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-3\u2013kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (i.e., c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase [JNK], p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERKs), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (Akt), interferon regulatory factor (IRF), \u03b2-catenin [47], as well as nuclear factor-\u043aB (NF-\u043aB) [48]. Increased NF-\u043aB expression increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines including chemokine ligand 2(CCL2), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-8 (IL-80, monocyte-chemo attractant protein\u20131, chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1 or GRO-\u03b1), type 1 IFN [[49], [50], [51]]; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2 and MMP9) [52] with upregulated adhesion molecules and antiapoptotic proteins such as B-cell CLL/lymphoma-2, Bcl-XL [53].",
