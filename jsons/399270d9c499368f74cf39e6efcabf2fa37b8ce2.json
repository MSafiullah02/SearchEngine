Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) affects up to 3% of children under the age of six years every year (1) and is also occasionally seen in older children and rarely in adolescents and adults (2) . Croup is most commonly caused by parainfluenza type 1 and 3 viral infection, but other viruses have been implicated including influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus, among others (1, (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . The infection leads to inflammation and oedema of the upper airway mucosa and narrowing of the subglottic region, causing varying degrees of airway obstruction. Classic symptoms include the sudden onset of barky cough and hoarse voice, and in more severe cases, stridor and chest wall indrawing. The majority of children have mild, shortlived symptoms (6) . However, a small proportion of children have moderate to severe symptoms which can result in hospital admission (8) (9) (10) , and in the most severe cases, intubation (11) (12) (13) (14) .",

            "text": "During the initial treatment of the child with croup, other important decisions need to be considered, the evidence for which seems not as clearly defined. For example, how does one decide on whether to admit a child with croup to hospital? Minimal published evidence is available regarding which children should be hospitalized. However, clinical practice guidelines advise admission for the child who has persistent stridor at rest and sternal indrawing four or more hours after treatment with glucocorticoids, as these findings are markers for more severe illness (15, 19) . Relative indications to be considered include a child living a long distance from hospital care, concerns about observation at home, significant parental anxiety and recurrent Emergency Department visits within 24 hours (15, 19) . A retrospective review of 527 consecutive children seen in an Emergency Department in Australia found that children who show sternal and chest wall retractions upon presentation are at increased risk for longer hospitalization, need for more medical therapies and need for airway intubation (20) . Inpatients must be closely monitored and frequently re-evaluated for changes in respiratory status. Criteria for discharge from hospital are also not informed by published evidence; however, clinical guidelines suggest that a child should be free of significant signs of airway obstruction for a minimum of two hours after epinephrine dosing (15) . This observation period is recommended as the clinical effect of epinephrine has disappeared by two hours following administration (21) . There is clinical trial data documenting that a child's symptoms do not worsen after epinephrine's effect has worn off, but rather, return to baseline severity at most (21, 22) .",

            "text": "Secondly, is there evidence to guide size of the glucocorticoid dose? The conventional dose of dexamethasone is 0.6 mg/kg, with doses of 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg also receiving study. Four randomized controlled trials comparing different doses of dexamethasone in children in the inpatient and outpatient setting have been published (29) (30) (31) (32) . Although all studies were small and none were designed as noninferiority studies, none showed a significant difference in outcome measures between the smaller and larger glucocorticoid doses. However, in a metaanalysis of six studies in children hospitalized for croup, there appeared to be a dose-response effect favouring higher doses of glucocorticoid (33) . Therefore, while there is evidence that 0.15 mg/kg may be adequate, it is not yet definitive. Finally, in a child who is hospitalized with croup, is a single dose of glucocorticoid sufficient? There are no randomized trials addressing repeated doses of glucocorticoids compared with a single dose. As croup symptoms typically resolve within 72 hours and the anti-inflammatory effect of dexamethasone is thought to last between two and four days (34) , in most cases repeated doses are not likely to be needed. However, studies are needed to formally address this question.",

            "text": "What about the child with mild croup? This subset of children will comprise the majority of cases seen by clinicians. Data from 24 general Emergency Departments in the province of Alberta, Canada, classified 85% of all children as having mild croup (unpublished data), defined clinically as presence of barky cough, but no stridor or chest wall indrawing at rest. In a tertiary care Children's Hospital Emergency Department in the same province, the percentage of children with mild croup was found to be somewhat lower at 65% (unpublished data), but still accounted for the majority of cases. Although no randomized controlled trial has studied the use of epinephrine in children with mild croup, since the therapeutic effect of epinephrine does not extend beyond a few hours, there would seem to be little rational basis for treatment with epinephrine. Glucocorticoid treatment in children with mild croup specifically has been studied in two randomized controlled trials which included only children presenting with mild croup, as defined by clinical scores. The first trial in 100 children ranging in age from four to 10 years compared dexamethasone to placebo and found that the group treated with dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) were significantly less likely to seek medical attention for ongoing croup symptoms within seven to 10 days after treatment (35) . The second trial in 720 children found that a single dose of dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg) reduced return for medical care for ongoing croup symptoms and reduced croup symptom severity (36) . The systematic review included subgroup analysis of outcomes by croup severity and found no significant differences between mild and moderate croup trials, consistent with the randomized controlled trials (37) . Thus, there is good evidence that children with mild croup derive benefit from a single oral dose of dexamethasone.",
