Affinity tag purification-mass spectrometry approaches identify groups of proteins that participate in complexes and these have been used to study the cellular make-up of Escherichia coli\n[2], [5], S. cerevisiae\n[17], [22], [27] and human cells [14]. While AP-MS assays have a higher propensity of detecting stable, stoichiometric complexes, Y2H screens tend to detect transient protein interactions [47]. Therefore the data from both approaches are complementary with respect to revealing physical connections between proteins, complexes and biological processes.",

For example, an intraviral Hepatitis C (HCV) Y2H interaction map was built using a limited set of predefined coding segments, which revealed the functional interactions between the proteins in the viral life cycle when a cell culture system is absent [15]. Also, using a Y2H approach, intraviral protein\u2013protein interaction networks have been generated for two herpesviruses, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) [40]. The resulting PPI networks appear as a single highly connected module whereas cellular networks (e.g. yeast and human) have been observed to be organized in functional modules. Despite a broad range of pathogenicity, herpesviruses share a significant percentage of common conserved genes and the authors attempted to define a core set of interactions conserved among these viruses. Calderwood et al. proteomically interrogated another herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), by classifying the genes into two evolutionary classes based on conservation and showed enrichment for interactions among proteins in the same evolutionary class [6]. Another example of an intraviral PPI network based yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis was obtained for SARS coronavirus [43]. SARS-CoV has 14 ORFs, most of whose functions are unknown. Interestingly, one of the accessory proteins turned out to be highly connected, and the authors propose that although not essential for viral replication in cell culture systems, it could enhance the global stability of the SARS proteome network and pathogenicity.",

For example, Lotteau and colleagues published a proteome-wide, Y2H-based mapping of interactions among HCV and human proteins. They reported 314 interactions (in addition to 170 literature curated interactions) and discovered that HCV CORE protein was a major perturbator of the insulin, Jak/STAT and TGF\u00df pathways [11]. More recently, another study targeted Vaccinia virus, a large double stranded DNA virus with more than 280 ORFs and a prototype of the Orthopoxvirus, which includes several pathogenic poxviruses such as variola virus, a lethal human-specific pathogen that causes smallpox [49]. The authors reported a comprehensive yeast-two hybrid screening with 109 protein\u2013protein interactions between vaccinia proteins and human proteins and provided functional insight into a number of uncharacterized viral proteins. Finally, Shapira et al. introduced a multilayered approach to uncover pathways in H1N1 infection by combining yeast-two-hybrid analysis and genome-wide expression profiling [38]. They found human factors mediating virus\u2013host interactions, which were further studied via depletion analysis in primary lung cells. These types of unbiased physical and regulatory models of virus\u2013host interactions provide a promising direction for the unveiling of new virus biology and development of new viral drugs [31].",

It was observed that pathogenic proteins preferentially interact with human hub proteins and \u201cbottleneck\u201d factors in human pathways. Although 190 pathogens were analyzed in this study, 98.3% of the interactions were obtained from viruses and 77.9% of them were associated with HIV. Interactions of each of its 18 proteins have been individually studied in numerous labs, mostly using Y2H, but also AP/MS, in vitro binding and other methodologies. In an attempt to catalog these data, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of AIDS (NIAID) has initiated the development of an HIV-1 Human Protein Interaction database [33]. From HIV relevant publications, 2589 unique HIV-human PPIs among 1448 human proteins were curated (Fig. 1\n); 32% of these interactions are reported to be direct, physical interactions. Surprisingly, 37% of the human proteins on this list interact with more than one HIV-1 protein. For example, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), a signaling protein, has been described to interact with 10 HIV proteins.",

The fact that the number of direct interactions reported for each protein vary considerably, ranging from only one for polymerase or reverse transcriptase and up to 219 for the 14 kDa protein Tat, suggests that this database includes false positives for some proteins while for others there still might be host interactors to be discovered. Therefore, although there have been a variety of excellent studies on HIV-1 human interactions, providing invaluable information about host factors crucial for HIV pathogenicity, a systematic approach of building the HIV-1\u2013host protein\u2013protein interaction network would help to get a clearer picture of the interconnection of the different virus components with the host cell. In this paper, we describe such an approach, based on AP-MS methodology, and describe how it can be used to proteomically interrogate HIV as well as other viruses.",

In order to accomplish this, however, one would have to tag the proteins in the context of the viral genome, infect the appropriate cells with these genetically altered viruses and then purify and identify the complexes. So far Integrase, Vif and Vpr have been successfully tagged within the provirus while maintaining infectivity [32], [36], [48]. Affinity purification of these proteins from infected cells led to the discovery of the Vif/Cul5 complex and the finding that DDB1 is an additional component of the Vpr/DCAF1 complex. While this strategy is a very elegant way to identify virus\u2013host interactions, it is not applicable to most of the HIV ORFs due to the overlapping organization of the HIV genome. Tagging these factors on either the N- or C-termini would disrupt the functions of the essential, overlapping proteins and would have detrimental effects on the function of the virus. Similarly, placing tags on the individual factors that comprise the polyproteins (Gag, Pol and Env) would result in similar expression problems for downstream proteins and/or adversely affect processing events by Protease, which would result in a disabled or comprised virus.",

            "text": "Once pull-down samples are acquired and analyzed by mass spectrometry, proteomic information concerning host\u2013pathogen interactions can be ascertained. MS identification of a host protein as a putative interactor allows for further investigation into the host\u2013pathogen interaction, employing methods such as yeast two-hybrid, biochemical assays, or viral infectivity assays, to verify and establish the biological relevance of the viral-host interaction. In this regard, proper quantitative analysis of mass spectrometry data derived from affinity purified viral or host proteins is essential in identifying biologically meaningful PPIs in order to minimize time and resources expended on false-positive MS identified interactors. However, one major caveat of reported PPIs obtained from AP-MS experiments is often little information relating to protein abundance or specificity is directly revealed. Also, the interactor abundance may not even be the best indicator of the interaction reliability, especially since some protein abundance strongly depend on interaction affinity as well as its concentration in the cell or in the final experimental sample. If the purified material from a single affinity purification of one tagged protein bait is analyzed, even when contrasted with data from a non-tagged control, it remains incredibly difficult to ascertain specificity and reproducibility with respect to putative interactors. Furthermore, shotgun sequencing approaches to protein identification suffer from poor sampling of IP proteins independent of precision of sample purification replicates. For example, shotgun sequencing of the same sample may only result in 30\u201340% overlap with respect to proteins identified and may require 5\u201310 separate runs to obtain 95% coverage [12], [20], [26].",

As an example concerning specificity, RNA binding proteins (e.g. Tat and Rev) will often be identified with ribosomal protein subunits due to binding to an RNA molecule and not a direct PPI occurring in situ. Likewise, any highly abundant cellular proteins (i.e. cytoskeleton proteins) tend to be identified in high abundance irrespective of the employed bait, indicating a problematic disconnect between protein abundance and interaction specificity. On the other hand, such non-specific interactions may not be very reproducible, which could in principle allow us to recognize them and filter them out.",

            "text": "Each pull-down experiment can be represented as a vector of abundance scores (defined below) for all of the unique interactors found in our approach. When the specific interactor is not pulled down with particular bait, its abundance score is set to zero. The vectors of different affinity purification experiments can then be organized into a two-dimensional matrix, and the vectors of the replicated experiments extending further into the third dimension. In order to quantify abundance of identified proteins within a sample and to allow normalization of this data across different samples such that values between multiple datasets can be accurately compared, one can use the label-free SIn normalization method described previously [20]. The SIn formula takes into account the spectral intensities from each interactor, the total spectral intensities observed in the MS run, and the length of the protein identified, and has been shown to outperform other methods of quantifying abundance such as spectral counts or number of interactors identified [20]. Assuming constant binding capacities for the same baits in different experimental runs, we can define a new SIn score (pSIn) for a particular interactor from a single pull-down experiment as a proportion of the real SIn scores in that particular experiment. The pSIn is now normalized and therefore equivalent across all of the experiments, and is used to fill in the matrix cells. The first of the three proposed metrics, abundance, is then an average of interactor pSIn scores in the third (replicates) dimension in our data matrix. The second metric, reproducibility, which is derived from the values in the third dimension as well, should be a measure of how the interactor amounts (or pSIn scores) are reproducible among replicated experiments. The more reproducible numbers would be hence uniformly distributed, but less reproducible numbers would form peak(s), which suggests using the entropy as a measure of system organization. Before applying a standard entropy equation to the data, one has to normalize the scores in this third dimension so that they add up to one. To avoid biases due to different number of replicates, we also normalize the entropy, dividing it with the maximal entropy possible. The third metric, specificity, is defined similarly to abundance, except that instead of using the proportion of pSIn scores in the vector (or in first dimension), we use the proportions of abundances in the second dimension of the matrix. To avoid the inconvenience of dealing with interactions described by three scores, one can compress the three metrics into a single score using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a statistical technique most commonly used to linearly transform the original set of data into the set of uncorrelated variables with the goal to reduce the dimensionality of this original data set.",

However, their genomes are surprisingly small considering the tasks they must carry out, and therefore they rely very heavily on the cellular machinery in the host cells they infect. Based on this, one might expect that one viral protein would be involved in multiple processes and therefore would hijack several host complexes during infection. Using an approach like AP-MS, therefore, would be a powerful way to identify these relationships, especially when it is conducted in an unbiased and systematic way. Overlaying the PPI network with genetic information derived from global RNAi screens [4], [25], [46], [50] would help identify which of these physical interactions have functional consequences. Finally, comparing host-pathogen protein\u2013protein interaction data using a variety of different viruses will help identify commonalities with respect to infection and should help develop new therapeutic strategies. Since vaccine and drug development targeting HIV proteins has been problematic, identifying novel host targets that aid in infection may represent the next step in combating HIV infection.",
