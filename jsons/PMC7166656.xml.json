These three seasons included the largest numbers of influenza A isolates (154, 68, 32). During other seasons, our experience was similar to Nicholson's, who performed prospective surveillance of 515 beds in English homes for the elderly. Individuals with new respiratory symptoms were identified, viral cultures and serological studies were performed, and 41 cases were laboratory\u2010confirmed, including five with influenza A and 11 with coronavirus, which can only be diagnosed serologically. The proportion of non\u2010influenza cases in the present study would probably be greater if corona virus serology had been included.

However, Arroyo et al. reported a nursing home outbreak that included the first isolates in South Carolina.10 The importance of cultures early in the season was underscored in December, 1995 when 285 cases of influenza A were cultured in the state of Wisconsin, and an outbreak of respiratory illness was encountered in two of our buildings. However, 26 isolates of parainfluenza 1 were cultured with no influenza A. If cultures had not been obtained, antiviral chemoprophylaxis could have been started unnecessarily. Osterweil and Norman reported the use of amantadine prophylaxis for an outbreak that was later serologically proven to be caused by RSV.11 In December 1992, we identified a large outbreak of respiratory illness, but it was caused by influenza B. A need for a precise diagnosis of influenza A and/or B will be more important when antiviral agents with activity against influenza B become available. During the 1996\u20101997 season, 22 non\u2010influenza A cases were identified in the face of six culture\u2010confirmed influenza A cases. Confusion regarding influenza A activity was possible without cultures. These observations underscore that if chemoprophylaxis is initiated because of a suspected outbreak, continued antiviral chemoprophylaxis should require laboratory confirmation.",

During our largest outbreak (1997\u20131998), team members often speculated on future influenza activity. The standard response became \u201conly a fool would predict.\u201d The timing of chemoprophylaxis termination is problematic inasmuch as reliable information on the duration of influenza activity in the community may not be available or germane to what is happening within the facility. In 1997\u20101998, the last cases at the Home occurred 1 week afterthe last cases in the rest of the state of Wisconsin. The duration of antiviral prophylaxis should be guided by ongoing surveillance within the facility. The importance of culturing at the end of the influenza season was suggested in 1991\u20101992 when we identified significant RSV activity at the end of the outbreak. We could have continued prophylaxis unnecessarily, based on the continued occurrence of clinical respiratory illnesses, had we not had surveillance culturing in place. In addition, the isolation of influenza A from a resident whose respiratory illness began in the second week of chemoprophylaxis (as occurred during the 1993\u20101994 season) suggests a resistant strain and might prompt a switch to an alternate antiviral when they become available.12 Timely and accurate information regarding influenza activity within the facility could allow a more focused duration of prophylaxis.",

The cost of 7 days of rimantadine for 200 residents is approximately $2450.00. Our current cost for an influenza culture is approximately $50.00. One week of rimantadine in a 200\u2010bed facility, therefore, has a cost similar to 40 viral cultures. Our system of intensive surveillance with cultures is unlikely to become the standard of care. Greater economy might include cultures restricted to febrile respiratory illness after influenza A has been cultured by a regional laboratory. If clinical criteria for an outbreak were approached, all residents with respiratory illness of recent onset could be cultured and antiviral prophylaxis initiated pending culture results. Culturing of any new respiratory illnesses could begin again before the anticipated discontinuation of prophylaxis (14 days) to determine if influenza activity was continuing.\n14\n\n",

We do not wish to discourage clinicians from initiating timely, lifesaving chemoprophylaxis. We consider the response to a winter outbreak of respiratory illness to be analogous to the timely response to a severe febrile illness. The clinician should obtain appropriate cultures and simultaneously initiate antimicrobial coverage pending the results of cultures. We recommend that clinicians perform surveillance for new respiratory symptoms, followed by laboratory confirmation, to determine an outbreak's beginning and end, thus enabling them to limit prophylaxis to the shortest effective duration.",
