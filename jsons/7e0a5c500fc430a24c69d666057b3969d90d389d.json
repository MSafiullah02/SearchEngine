He has multiple comorbidities including long-term tobacco use, congestive heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. Upon admission, he was found to be declining rapidly with increased oxygen need and possible escalation of care to intubation with mechanical ventilator support. His spouse was not allowed to be at bedside because of the medical center's recently implemented infection control \"no visitors\" policy. The ICU physician told the patient's wife that there was a shortage of ventilators and that the triage team had made a negative escalation-of-care decision regarding her husband's treatment. She began begging to see her husband. As the team psychologist, you were asked to calm her and provide compassionate support. You had previously participated in the facility's scarce resource allocation discussions, and you know that her husband will die without assisted ventilation. The patient's wife began wailing from the first sentence of your conversation, which is agonizing to hear. She tells you that she has been quarantined at home alone for the past 12 days and she desperately wants to see her husband. You provide empathic listening as you grapple with the realities of the couple's separation during his final hours. Despite her incessant pleading, it is critical that you abide by the visitation policy resulting from the hospital's escalation of care model and standardized treatment protocol. This was the third case of the day for which you had been forced to \"hold the line\" on the nocontact policy. What is it costing you to do this work? Will it ever end? Will it have long-term effects on you?",

The shift from in-person care to email, telephone, and video contact has necessitated changes in how psychologists establish rapport. The intersection of technology and psychotherapy can be challenging because of equipment availability and access to technology. When technology is available, attention must be given to ensuring adequate connection bandwidth, monitor resolution, camera and microphone placement, sitting position, and the focal point on the screen for natural eye contact.

Psychologists are ideal facilitators for these support forums. Dialog about the clash between clinical ethics and public health ethics may be common themes in these groups. Knowing these ethical principles and how they are impacting scarce resource allocation and triage protocols in hospital settings can bolster efforts to resolve moral distress when violations occur. For instance, when a patient's treatment preference to use mechanical ventilation cannot be upheld because of standardized triage decisions, identifying the principles in conflict (autonomy vs. justice) becomes an important first step in understanding why feelings of guilt might surface. Subsequently, reconstructing more flexible moral schemas that integrate contextual factors can reduce a sense of responsibility and promote healing (Litz et al., 2009 ).",

When under duress, leaders in systems may slip into harsh reactions to negative patient outcomes. Organizational responses can cause providers and psychologists to feel helpless in the face of growing tragedy. Psychologists are susceptible to this, too. Guilt and blame associated with moral distress can undermine self-confidence. Identifying and evaluating these feelings through mindfulness activities and consultation with colleagues can lay the groundwork to challenge cognitive (mis)attributions that have contributed to these emotions.",

Each person can be asked to share something for which they are grateful, whether it is something at work or in their personal lives.

Find ways to dialog through video chat, telephone, and email. Talk about your reactions and the distress you are experiencing. If moral distress-a seemingly impossible conflict between values and actions-arises, talk about it. & Connect with patients.
