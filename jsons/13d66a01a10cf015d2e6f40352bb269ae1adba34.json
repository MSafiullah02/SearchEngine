The density is the number of existing ties in the network divided by the number of potential ties.

The social network analyses on cattle owner herding strategies showed that network connectivity and density were higher in the rainy season, but these variables were not the most influential to explain the incidence of FMD in cattle. We cannot rule out that our sample sizes were not large enough but so far intraspecific interactions do not appear to be the main drivers of the FMD dynamics in cattle at wild/domestic interface. The seasonal dynamics of FMD can neither be explained by the contacts between cattle and buffalo. Indeed, contacts between cattle and buffalo occurred mainly at the end of the hot dry season (i.e., November) in the vicinity of water points when surface-water availability strongly constrains herbivore distribution (Redfern, Grant, Biggs, & Getz, 2003) , compared to later in the rainy season when buffalo are more evenly distributed over the landscape.

Indeed, FMD antibodies are produced shortly after infection (Grubman & Baxt, 2004) and no significant lag between infection and serological conversion was expected (i.e., no longer than 14 days). There are three alternative and non-exclusive interpretations for this lag. The first is that virus survival in the environment is high enough for cattle to become infected when they use areas where buffalo have been present some time before (i.e., longer than the 15 days used for the temporal window that defines direct or delayed contacts). The second is that wild ungulate species other than buffalo, such as impala (Aepyceros melampus), greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), could play a role as secondary reservoirs of the FMD (Thomson et al., 2003) or function as bridge populations that generate epidemiological links between buffalo and cattle populations (Caron, Cappelle, Cumming, de Garine-Wichatitsky, & Gaidet, 2015) . Under such scenarios, the frequent cattle incursions during the rainy season in areas used previously or concomitantly by reservoir and/or bridge population(s) could explain the peak of FMD incidence in cattle population during that season. Unfortunately, our study was not designed to be able to assess the role of other herbivore populations in the epidemiology of FMD. Nevertheless, these other herbivore species were present in the study interface and could have potentially played a role in disease transmission. Thirdly, the study did not allow us to assess the role of small unmonitored buffalo groups (such as bachelor herds) (Caron, Cornelis, Foggin, Hofmeyr, & de Garine-Wichatitsky, 2016) or single adult animals (van Schalkwyk et al., 2016) that could also play a significant role in FMD dynamics.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 491, "end": 513, "text": "(Grubman & Baxt, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1222, "text": "(Thomson et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1397, "text": "(Caron, Cappelle, Cumming, de Garine-Wichatitsky, & Gaidet, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2034, "end": 2099, "text": "(Caron, Cornelis, Foggin, Hofmeyr, & de Garine-Wichatitsky, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2124, "end": 2152, "text": "(van Schalkwyk et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Landscape of infection at the wildlife/livestock interface"}, {"text": "In this study, we tested the hypothesis that predators could modulate the likelihood of encounters between livestock and wild herbivores, and ultimately influence pathogen transmission between them. We did not detect any significant and reasonable relationship at short term between cattle and lion. However, lions and cattle are frequently using the same area. More interestingly, the analysis of incursion frequency time series revealed that lions made frequent incursions in the buffer few days to few weeks after buffalo had used it, suggesting a potential attraction effect of buffalo on lions. If this is the case, it is noteworthy that lions use the buffer not only shortly after buffalo had used it (3 days), but also after longer time-lags (up to 40 days). The buffalo autocorrelogram showed weak but significant positive autocorrelation persisting over 40 days. Conversely, buffalo, which are the main prey for lions in the Hwange ecosystem (Davidson et al., 2013) , did not use the buffer zone when it had been occupied by lions a few weeks before, which could suggest an avoidance of lions by buffalo but at a temporal scale that is not traditionally considered. Such results (even if the value of the correlations are not very high) pave the way for future research to test the scenario whereby lions and buffalo are engaged in a \"predator-prey space game\" at the landscape scale as revealed in other species (Johnson, de Roode, & Fenton, 2015) , and encourage for the investigation of several temporal scales. Under such scenario, lions might play a role of natural barrier between sympatric species by reducing the spatio-temporal overlap between cattle and buffalo in the buffer zone, and consequently the likelihood of direct or indirect contacts, which will ultimately influence FMD transmission (Proffitt et al., 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 951, "end": 974, "text": "(Davidson et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1457, "text": "(Johnson, de Roode, & Fenton, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1837, "text": "(Proffitt et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Landscape of fear"}, {"text": "Our results showed that cattle entered the buffer of the protected area almost exclusively during the rainy season in this part of the Hwange system as it was observed in similar ecosystem in Zimbabwe (Kuiper et al., 2015) . This pattern is informative at three levels. First, the rainy season coincides not only with the season when resources (grazing and water) are the most abundant and allow access to a larger home range but also with the ploughing and the crop growing and harvesting period in communal areas. The amount of agricultural work required and the necessity to keep cattle herds out of growing fields encourage unmanned cattle herds to graze away from communal lands and hence more into the buffer zone (Murwira, 2012) . After harvest, cattle are fed on crop residues in fields during the early dry season which constrains cattle movements to areas closer to villages and further from protected areas as it was described in (Kuiper et al., 2015) . Second, we might have expected the resource availability (vegetation and surface water) in protected areas to be attractive for cattle owners during the dry season. At this time, surface water is scarce and grass is rare or trampled in the vicinity of homesteads and driving cattle inside the protected areas would be an opportunity (Prins, 1996; Zengeya, Murwira, & de Garine-Wichatitsky, 2011) . However, the buffer was not used by cattle during the dry season. This suggests that cattle owners decide to rely on lower quality resources in the communal land, maybe to avoid the risks of infection, not only from FMD virus but also tick diseases which are a burden for farmers, and/or predation in the protected area. It has been shown that cattle are more frequently killed by lions during the wet season than during the dry season. Indeed, \"seasonal use of protected areas during growing season increases vulnerability of cattle to lion depredation\" (Kuiper et al., 2015) . The optimized strategy for cattle herders at the wildlife/livestock interface might be to decrease the likelihood of livestock depredation by avoiding the use of protected areas when the constraints in communal lands are acceptable (i.e., when the crop period is finished). Considering that the risk of being fined for entering the protected area is the same throughout the year, we assume that this effect could not explain the seasonal variation of the cattle buffer use. Third, conversely to the intuitive idea that the dry season is a risky period for disease transmission, as it was shown in similar ecosystems with a lesser predation pressure Miguel et al., 2013; Zvidzai, Murwira, Caron, & de Garine-Wichatitsky, 2013) , our study shows that the rainy season is the key season for foot-andmouth disease transmission and potential exposure to predation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 201, "end": 222, "text": "(Kuiper et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 720, "end": 735, "text": "(Murwira, 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 941, "end": 962, "text": "(Kuiper et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1311, "text": "(Prins, 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1360, "text": "Zengeya, Murwira, & de Garine-Wichatitsky, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1939, "text": "(Kuiper et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2591, "end": 2611, "text": "Miguel et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2612, "end": 2667, "text": "Zvidzai, Murwira, Caron, & de Garine-Wichatitsky, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| Human behaviour and seasonality"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our study brings scientific elements to consider that predator-prey-host interactions, the availability of resources driven by seasonality and human herding practices adapting/reacting to the perceived state of the system influence FMD transmission.

This pattern resulted in an autocorrelogram showing strong positive autocorrelation extending as far as 50 days implying that cattle incursion frequency could be predicted over a long time period from current incursion frequency (Figure 3d). This contrasts strongly with the pattern of lion incursion. Lion incursion index showed no clear seasonal variation but large short-term variation (Figure 3c). This pattern resulted in an autocorrelogram with positive autocorrelation persisting only over a few days implying that current lion incursion frequency could inform future lion incursion frequency over a couple of days only (Figure 3f).
