The etiologic agents of acute gastrointestinal symptoms are well described in the literature and include parasites (eg, Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Cyclospora histolytica, and Entamoeba histolytica ), bacteria (eg, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Vibrio cholerae, enterovirulent Escherichia coli, Aeromonas, Yersinia, Bacillus perfringens, and Clostridium perfringens ), and viruses (eg, enteroviruses, rotaviruses, parvoviruses, adenoviruses, caliciviruses, and astroviruses). Pathogens can be transmitted to humans by water, person-to-person contact, animal-to-human contact, food, and aerosols. Parasites are identified as pathogens of importance in all countries, and numerous waterborne outbreaks of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis have been reported in the United States and the United Kingdom. Infectious agents are not the only cause of acute diarrheal disease. Milk or soy protein intolerance, food abuses or diet changes, adverse effects of prescription drugs (especially antibiotics), as well as fungal, algal, or shellfish toxins may all cause diarrhea. A number of chemicals can also induce gastrointestinal symptoms, such as monosodium glutamate, organic mercury, antimony, and copper.5, 6\n",

            "text": "In general, deriving a good estimate of the incidence of endemic acute gastrointestinal disease in a community is very difficult. Symptoms develop in only a few of the persons who are infected, and only a proportion of these persons will seek medical attention. The doctor may not report the illness, or if samples are taken they may fail to reveal a pathogen. If a pathogen is identified, the result may or may not be reported to a surveillance system (if such a system exists). Only a small proportion of acute episodes reach this level. Existing surveillance systems are thus likely to significantly underestimate the real burden of gastrointestinal disease.7, 8 Few studies have investigated the incidence of gastrointestinal disease at the community level, and most of these studies have been conducted in North America. These studies include the Cleveland study,4, 9 the Tecumseh study,10, 11 and the Virus Watch Program.12 Reported gastrointestinal illness rates were in the range of 0.5 to 2 episodes per year per person, varying from 5 to 100 episodes per 1000 persons per week, according to seasons and age. The number of episodes of gastrointestinal illnesses reported in these studies is similar to the number reported in some recent epidemiologic studies. A seasonal pattern of gastrointestinal illness is often observed. Adults are usually the least susceptible, and children younger than 5 years are the most susceptible. Peaks can be observed in children in autumn, whereas values as low as 5 episodes per 1000 persons per week are reported in summer.",

Enteric viruses are excreted through the feces in the environment by infected persons with or without clinical illness. The enteric viruses include more than 100 types: enteroviruses (eg, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, and hepatitis A), reovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, coronavirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, and Norwalk-like agents.13 Health effect studies have provided data on the prevalence of antibodies to several enteric viruses in US populations.14 Data indicate that the hepatitis A virus is an infection acquired progressively in life, and that in the United States, relatively few children have antibodies to this virus. In contrast, these infections generally are acquired early in life by people in other countries because of low hygiene levels.",

            "text": "Getting a clear understanding of the incidence of diarrhea in developing countries is even more difficult than it is in industrialized countries. Using the results of available studies to produce an overall estimate of diarrheal disease in developing countries is difficult for a number of reasons. Levels of diarrheal disease may markedly differ between relatively close communities because of different socioeconomic factors, such as the availability of a clean water supply and hygiene behavior. Estimates of diarrheal disease incidence from a variety of prospective epidemiologic studies indicate a range of 1 of 25 episodes per person per year. It seems clear that the incidence is higher in poorer communities and in rural environments than in urban environments. The age distribution of persons with diarrheal disease in developing countries seems to be similar in all regions in which this information reported. Disease incidence is relatively low in the first few months of life, and then peaks at about 24 months before declining toward adulthood. Travelers to developing countries are at risk.15, 16 Data from various countries indicate a similar incidence of 1 to 15 episodes per person per year for travelers, suggesting a high degree susceptibility and a high attack rate. This difference is even more notable given the fact that travelers usually live in more hygienic surroundings than do local persons. Thus, the evidence presented supports the hypothesis that local people build up a substantial immunity to the enteropathogens circulating in their communities. However, a consequence of achieving this level of immunity there is that young children in developing countries have a substantially higher incidence of illness than do children in developed nations. This high incidence of gastrointestinal disease in children is one of the reasons behind the high childhood mortality rates in developing countries.",

In southeastern China17 and Uzbekistan,18 diarrhea related to the source of drinking water was estimated to comprise about 85% of the illnesses in people who drank river water. In the Philippines, Moe et al19 reported that improved drinking water would have little or no effect in areas with poor environmental sanitation. In areas with good community sanitation,20 reducing fecal coliform counts by 2 orders of magnitude would result in a 40% reduction in the incidence of diarrhea; eliminating excreta from around houses would result in a 30% reduction; and providing private excreta disposal would result in a 42% reduction.",

In an unsanitary environment, contaminated fomites are everywhere. Furthermore, when the family or the community includes a large number of children, rates of circulation and transmission of infectious diseases are extremely high. Often these children have not received training in personal hygiene. The level of hygiene attained by a community will control gastrointestinal diseases to an equivalent level. Actions should be directed toward keeping surfaces (eg, floors, walls, tables, and fixtures) as clean as possible. Handwashing and other personal hygiene activities will prevent fecal material from being transferred to surfaces where pathogens can survive for various periods. Transmission of pathogens from one person to the other has been demonstrated to occur after a simple handshake; significant contamination can be transmitted to as many as 6 people. A single contaminated doorknob can act as the reservoir to contaminate an entire household. In a very hygienic community, very few persons will harbor pathogens at any given time. Even if fecal contamination of surfaces occurs, the fecal material does not contain pathogens most of the time. However, it can serve as an index of fecal contamination and poor personal hygiene in all environments.",
