In addition, H3N2 viruses were considered to be seeded from Southeast Asia before spreading globally. This study described the molecular epidemiology of influenza A during the post-pandemic season 2010-2011 in Vietnam. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from children with respiratory infections at Children's Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City. The HA, NA, M genes were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. Thirty-five of 1,082 (3.2%) patients were positive for influenza A, including 14 pandemic H1N1 2009 (H1N1pdm09) and 21 H3N2 infections. H3N2 was dominant in the rainy season (May-October 2010) while H1N1pdm09 was dominant in the dry season (November 2010 -April 2011 . Phylogenetic analysis showed that Vietnamese H1N1pdm09 sequences in 2010-2011 formed the distinct cluster, with other contemporary Asian and 2012-American sequences, suggesting a possible common ancestor. All were oseltamivirsensitive except two strains carrying S247N and D199N in NA which reduced the neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility. The Vietnamese H3N2 viruses in mid-2010 belonged to the emerging subclade Perth10/2010, which then spread worldwide in 2011. The Vietnamese influenza viruses were well matched with the Southern Hemisphere vaccine formulation. Mutations at antigenic sites were also identified in these viruses. Surveillance of influenza viruses in tropical countries is important not only for development of their prevention and control strategies but also for earlier identification of",

The influenza epidemics lead to approximately 3 to 5 million severe illness cases and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year [World Health Organization, 2014] . The ability to acquire genetic changes makes the virus to overcome the immunity from previous infections and causes yearly epidemics. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza A viruses usually mutate at high frequencies [Peter et al., 2013] . As a result, the accumulation of these mutations at critical positions may lead to alter the antigenic characteristics of surface glycoproteins and the antiviral drug susceptibility. Therefore, monitoring these genetic changes of influenza virus is important for vaccine strain selection as well as identification of drug resistant strains.",

Thus, influenza vaccine is delivered annually to protect against the newly emerged influenza strains. In contrast, influenza virus circulates throughout the year with no clear seasonality in tropical regions. Moreover, little epidemiological information about influenza makes it more difficult to develop the prevention and control programs in these settings [Viboud et al., 2006] . It also has been proposed that Southeast and East Asia are regions where influenza virus A/H3N2 first evolved before spreading worldwide [Rambaut et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2008a] . Therefore, influenza virologic surveillance in these areas is necessary not only to understand the circulation of influenza viruses but also to identify the virus strains which may be included in the annual influenza vaccine composition.",

However, the phylogenetic analysis showed that the mid-2010 Vietnamese H3N2 viruses grouped with viruses from other countries in the winter 2010-2011 and belonged to the A/Perth/10/2010 subclade (Fig. 4) Therefore, taken together with previous studies [Nguyen et al., 2009 Vuong et al., 2013; Saha et al., 2014] , these results suggest that the Southern Hemisphere formulation and timing should be considered for use in Vietnam instead of the current Northern Hemisphere one.

The S185T located within the receptor binding site and the A197T located nearby may affect the binding of HA with its receptor [Yang et al., 2010] . The E374K located in the HA oligomerization interface may have role in membrane fusion [Russell et al., 2008b] .

However, the antigenic properties of these viruses against the vaccine strain were not examined in this study. Therefore, whether these changes affect the vaccine effectiveness needs to be elucidated. In addition, the mutation associated with oseltamivirresistant H275Y was not detected. Instead, 2 mutations D199N and S247N on the NA, which reduced the neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility, were found. It should be noted that none of these patients were treated with antiviral drugs. The S247N was observed in viruses from Australia and Southeast Asia with mild reduction in oseltamivir and zanamivir susceptibility [Hurt et al., 2011] . The D199N mutation has recently detected from patients with oseltamivir resistance [Deyde et al., 2010; Ghedin et al., 2011] and exhibited to reduce susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir [Okomo-Adhiambo et al., 2013] . Although the D199E/G/N mutations have respectively shown to reduce susceptibility to oseltamivir in seasonal H1N1, H5N1, and B influenza viruses, the effect of D199N mutation among H1N1pdm09 needs further investigation [Ghedin et al., 2011] . It should be noted that the viruses in this study were not cultured to avoid the generation of adaptive mutations in vitro.",

Most of patients in this study were <2 years of age might explain for the low influenza infection rate. Thirdly, the data were only collected on patients seeking hospital care, thus the results may not reflect episodes of milder disease occurring simultaneously in the community. Finally, the study was lack of the antigenic assay against vaccine strains and the antiviral drug susceptibility tests. Therefore, the inferences regarding the protection of vaccine strains or of antiviral drugs are limited. However, the genetic data are also useful since amino acid mutations in some important regions usually correlate with significant antigenic changes [Smith et al., 2004] .",

The Vietnamese H3N2 viruses did not group with the vaccine strain A/Brisbane/10/2007 in 2009-2010.These data proved that the influenza activity in Vietnam appeared earlier than in other temperate countries in the Northern Hemisphere, and the current Northern Hemisphere vaccine usage may be too late to provide the optimal protection. These findings are consistent with the recent genetic relatedness analysis of seasonal influenza A viruses circulating in Vietnam from 2001 to 2009, which showed the high match with the Southern Hemisphere vaccine strains[Vuong et al., 2013].",
