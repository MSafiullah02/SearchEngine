The lack of unified control measures, poor biosecurity and the increased international trade in horses has assisted in the spread of EAV.

The outbreak began on a non-thoroughbred stud and spread to five other premises via chilled semen used for artificial insemination. Around 100 animals became infected and the outbreak was contained by means of voluntary movement restrictions. Subsequently EAV was made notifiable in the UK (EAV order 1995).

Whilst it would have been interesting to compare further gene segments appropriate geographic and time point distribution were observed across ORF5 sequences only. As seen from Fig. 2 limited information could be gleaned from phylogeny of full genome data as these data are limited in number and location. It is anticipated that with the development of full genome sequencing into a routine technology, more viruses from all currently existing clades will be added soon to allow for a wider comparison. With regards to GB_Glos_2012 it would be particularly interesting to compare it against the South African and Hungarian strains with which the isolate clustered as here we were limited to the 518 nucleotides of the ORF5 available for the other strains. As with PRRSV, variability of nsp2 is also noted for EAV. We reported a three nucleotide deletion at codon 459 of protein 1ab and comparison with other full genome sequences highlighted numerous alterations in this region e.g. strain S4445 contains a 5 amino acid insertion between codons 448 and 489 of protein 1ab. As with the phylogeny, we were again limited in our ability to collate such observations as the publicly available sequence data for the nsp2 region is restricted to data from the USA or France with the majority of these sequences being linked to a single outbreak in each of these countries.",

GB_Glos_2012 demonstrates the re-emergence of a genotype across decades and around the globe. KY63 is a field strain isolated in Kentucky, USA in 1963; this isolate has always clustered separately from the other US isolates of the same time period suggesting a different origin. Strains H10 and H21 appear to have been isolated in the early 2000s in Hungary and the \u201cSouth African\u201d strains were isolated in the mid-1990s with a history of Eastern European imports, whereas the isolated characterised here (GB_Glos_2012) is from a Spanish stallion. Even considering a potential lack of sampling the case demonstrates that established strains do not become extinct and through global trade may re-appear unexpectedly. This is surprising since Arteriviruses, such as EAV or PRRSV are known for their rapid evolution, linked to the lack of a proofreading enzyme such as the exoribonuclease ExoN, which Coronaviruses for example contain and which is vital for their genetic integrity (Minskaia et al., 2006, Nga et al., 2011).",

This significantly broadens our understanding of the evolution of such viruses: in the absence of appropriate control measure to eradicate certain viruses (strains), host pressure will lead to a continuous divergence of viruses, but with the parallel persistence of \u201cold\u201d variants.",

A similar approach could be undertaken for EAV and thus aid in resolving the differences observed between phylogenies.

As all such systems the approach is not static: sequences that currently remaining outside the clades may form new clusters or existing clusters expand to include such current outliers. Existing clusters may divide into two or more new clusters (not least depending on criteria to be defined further) or even that clusters collapse (cluster C does not have strong bootstrap support at present for example). Importantly, we think that previous approaches by Mittelholzer et al. (2006) and Zhang et al. (2007) made reference to the nomenclature for PRRSV, which is confusing. The numerical nomenclature system (e.g. EAV-1) conveys the impression of subtypes, sub-species or alike. For EAV no biologically criteria have been identified to define such and serologically there is only one group. However, the strains identified in South Africa (Fig. 3, cluster G) are the furthest away from all other viruses; this highlights that a second serogroup or (sub)-species may arise in the future. Similarly reference to and EU or NA origin is not warranted for EAV. More than with PRRSV, EAV strains are spreading globally and the historic origins are not traceable: since clinical outbreaks of EAV appear only periodically, it is assumed that EAV circulated already long before its first isolation.",
