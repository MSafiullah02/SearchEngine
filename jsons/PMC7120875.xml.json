During this time frame, we have gone from a \u201ccraftsman-oriented\u201d economy to a \u201cmass-produced\u201d type of economy. We have gone from a \u201ccommunity-centric\u201d environment to a \u201cglobally centric\u201d one [2]. We have seen the rise and fall of innumerable hegemonies of government to a more pluralistic kind of control [3].

Sir Karl Popper has written elegantly about the basics of scientific change: \u201cThe critical attitude may be described as the conscious attempt to make our theories, our conjectures, suffer in our stead in the struggle for the survival of the fittest. It gives us a chance to survive the elimination of an inadequate hypothesis- when a more dogmatic attitude would eliminate it by eliminating us\u201d [4]. But how can anyone predict the future? In fact, the literature is strewn with the flotsam and prophesies gone awry. For instance, Bill Gate\u2019s 1981 classic, \u201c640,000 bytes of memory ought to be enough for anybody.\u201d Ken Olson in 1997 stated, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for individuals to a computer in their home.\u201d Better for our purposes is Yogi Berra\u2019s quip, \u201cIt\u2019s tough to make predictions, especially about the future\u201d [5].",

            "text": "No one can accurately predict the future. New developments and new discoveries are always capable of rewriting what we think we know. Chance certainly plays a role and no one could have foreseen the impact of the World Wide Web on our society when Tim Burners-Lee wrote the code for CERN in 1991 (note: that\u2019s not that long ago!). So why spend so much time on something as fickle as the future? You can think about what has happened to us by a lack of foresight as we\u2019ve already alluded to, or you can consider the scenario of nuclear weapons as an example. Would you rather develop a monster before you consider how to make a cage? Long-term forecasting is not futile when carefully considered concerns remain the focus. To quote Drexler, \u201cIn a race toward the limits set by natural law, the finish line is predictable even if the path and pace of the runners are not\u201d [6]. David Hume, the eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher, introduced in 1737 the notion that observations cannot logically prove a general rule; rationalism cannot be trusted [7]. By 1945, Bertrand Russell presented the twentieth century\u2019s response to the \u201cgrowth of unreason\u201d and the death of empiricism to vault us into our modern era [8]. This thinking has led us to our recent predilection of future speculation and the scientists\u2019 favorite science philosopher Karl Popper phenomenon of evolutionary process of development [4]. Technologic variations and advancements are quite often deliberate, plodding, and crude in comparison to the science that lies behind them. Edison tried virtually every product on the planet before settling upon tungsten as the filament for his incandescent light bulb [9]. Charles Goodyear tried everything to make unacceptable rubber into the moldable, durable substance we today use in tires by a chance drop of sulfurized rubber in his lab. The point is that engineering the marvels of tomorrow\u2019s technology is methodical and predictable in a fashion in that it is evolving. Future breakthroughs result in rapid progress. Progress evolves through cycles of design, calculation, criticism, redesign, and construction. So, forced by competition and testing, science evolves towards more power and accuracy. Efforts to predict the engineering achievements started way back in classic Greek technology. Leonardo da Vinci in his collected works called the Codex Atlanticus made projections using detailed drawings regarding the ability of machines to improve upon motion and power control with machines [10]. He designed an earth-mover to make canals that were never built. He designed a robotic man at the age of 30. He utilized a design he envisioned at the age of 26 to power his automated soldier or knight. This device used a front wheel drive, rack-and-pinion automated cart to provide both the power and the mobility that his robot would require. Leonardo designed a chain-drive system that would remain unbuilt for almost three centuries and the bicycle. He failed to build an aircraft because of his inadequate understanding of modern aerodynamics and lift. But this lack of scientific knowledge certainly did not stop him from designing these machines [10].",

            "text": "Prior to concluding this section of the introduction, there are three key publications that are worth reviewing. The first is Vannevar Bush\u2019s 1945 article that appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, entitled \u201cAs We May Think\u201d [11]. Bush was an MIT-trained engineer with a particular aptitude for math. He was a young professor at Tufts when World War I broke out. Bush developed a device that would use magnetic fields to detect submarines. He traveled to Washington in May of 1917 to meet with the new director of a group of scientists advising the government, the National Research Council (NRC). After the war, Bush matriculated back to MIT\u2019s electrical engineering department. He became interested in analog computers to solve complex equations and by 1931 he completed the first differential analyzer. He also proposed and built a machine for the FBI that could review 1,000 fingerprints per minute which he called a rapid selector. In 1937, Bush became the president of the Carnegie Institution with a then $1.5 million annual budget for research. His prestige rapidly increased and by 1940 Roosevelt called on him to create a new national organization for scientific military research called the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). Bush was made the first chairman and given a direct line to the White House. By 1941 the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) was set up and Bush became its director [12]. Bush became intimately involved in advising Roosevelt about the Manhattan Project. Colliers magazine hailed Bush as the \u201cman who may win or lose the war\u201d. By war\u2019s end, Bush dreamed about a national science group and the National Science Foundation was created in 1950 [12]. He published \u201cAs We May Think\u201d in the Atlantic Monthly. This article describes a whole host of technologies that did not then exist. He describes a theoretical machine called a \u201cmemex.\u201d This was to be a multipurpose intelligence extender. The memex would be a repository of general information that a user could call upon for facts and figures [11]. His description is hauntingly close to modern hypertext and the Internet. In 1960, Ted Nelson, who coined the term hypertext acknowledged his debt to Bush.",

            "text": "The second article was first presented on December 29, 1959, at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society at the California Institute of Technology. It was subsequently published in the February issue of Caltech\u2019s Engineering Science by the Nobel laureate Richard P. Feynman. The title, typical of Feynman, was inauspiciously called \u201cThere\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\u201d [13]. He stated that he wished to talk about \u201cthe problem of manipulating and controlling things on a small scale\u201d [13]. He goes on to state that an enormous number of technical applications would arise from such a technology and that there were no fundamental reasons of physics preventing its development. He proceeded in the ensuing 11 pages to recount the possibilities of molecular engineering, which heretofore have been unheard of. He then continued with the physics of such machines including miniaturization, lubrication, supply, and demand. He concluded with a discussion of \u201crearranging the atoms\u201d themselves. He speculates the complexities involved with quantum physics at the atomic level, but concludes \u201cThe principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom. It is not an attempt to violate any laws; it is something, in principle that can be done; but in practice, it has not been done because we are too big\u201d [13]. He stated that it is his opinion that such a nanotechnology (sic word mine) cannot be avoided in the future. And he created a cash award of $1,000 for school kids and engineers to start this technology: \u201cI do not expect that such prizes will have to wait very long for claimants\u201d [13]. But Feynman never saw the emergence of this technology in his lifetime. Tom Newman, a Stanford electrical engineering grad student, used electron-beam lithography to transcribe the first page of Charles Dickens\u2019s A Tale of Two Cities onto a square 1/160th of a millimeter on the head of a pin [14]. In fact, it was not until the Bush Administration was leaving office that Clinton enacted the National Nanotechnology Initiative in order to speed basic research.",

            "text": "The final article which fittingly concludes this section while also introducing the next appeared in Electronics in April 19, 1965, by Gordon E. Moore. The article was called \u201cCramming more components onto integrated circuits\u201d by the then director of Research and Development of Fairchild Semiconductor [15]. He started this article with the prophetic words: \u201cThe future of integrated electronics is the future of electronics itself\u201d [15]. Moore talked about the future of intelligent technologies as no one before had; he speculated about ubiquitous computerization. He stated that computers of the future will be distributed, not centralized. He predicted that the machines of the future would be built at lower costs and with faster turnaround because of acceleration of power and capacity. He based his observations on 25 years of experience in the miniaturization of electronic components. He predicted that integrated electronics would become generally available throughout all of society, performing many functions that presently are done inadequately by high-cost systems. He predicted that silicon would most likely remain the basic material of semiconductors and the key to this expansion. He finally warmed to his topic in talking about graphs and curves he had generated. For simple circuits, he said, the cost per component was nearly inversely proportional to the number of components. He demonstrated cost curves from 1962, 1965, and 1970 showing a 1/10 reduction in cost but he didn\u2019t stop there. He predicted that if trends hold, and he saw no reasons why they should not, then within 10 years an integrated circuit with 65,000 components could be achieved for minimum cost and the size will be reduced to about \u00bc a square inch. He also predicted the heat generated by tens of thousands of components in a single silicon chip. He also noted that the shrinking dimensions on the integrated structure would result in operations at higher speeds for the same power per unit area [15]. Thus, in one neat and tidy paper, Moore predicted the coming era of intelligence technologies. All subsequent works on the future of these technologies continued Moore\u2019s prescient observations and his doubling times have eroded, not held constant. Technology is advancing faster than Moore even conceded.",

            "text": "The goal of this section is to convince you that all of our previous recorded history regarding technology in general and digital intelligent technologies in particular are converging. Convergence is that phenomenon when the focal capacity in any given area meets at commonality. The commonality of all of these technologies is life itself. Lest you think that believable science is being stretched into science fiction, a wide variety of resources will be utilized that are available to you, the reader (disbeliever or believer), so that you can check on the sources\u2019 validity of anything that this author is writing about. Ray Kurzweil, the entrepreneurial scientist who developed digital software for the music industry, has published several books on this subject. He has a website and technologic discussion blog with graphs regarding human technologic advancement as the fundamental preposition and he devised the law of accelerating returns. K. Eric Drexler published \u201cEngines of Creation\u201d that has already been mentioned. He suggested that mankind was approaching a new frontier of technologic advance based upon nanotechnology that would be fostered by advances in intelligent technologies [6]. In June 2002 our own National Science Foundation (introduced by the way by Vannevar Bush, recall \u201cAs We May Think\u201d) met in Arlington, Virginia, and reported upon \u201cConverging Technologies for Improving Human Performance\u201d [16]. They focused on specific issues that are rapidly advancing in four areas of scientific research. These included nanotechnology, biotechnology, informational technology, and cognitive science. In addition, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has now had yearly scientific workshops and meetings specifically addressing the convergence of technologies and the applications to space exploration. By reviewing each of the salient pieces of these science facts, it is hoped that you too will feel the growing excitement that has spawned so much negative or \u201cconservative\u201d scientific response by some serious researchers. Francis Fukuyama has publicized his views of the perils of converging technologies in \u201cOur Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution\u201d [17].",

Carnegie Mellon bestowed their top science award to him in 1994, and he won the American Publisher\u2019s Award for Most Outstanding Computer Science Book in 1990 for his \u201cAge of Intelligent Machines\u201d [18].

He outlined a scenario where our technology has become so sophisticated that it endangers the human species.

What has Joy so spooked is a well-fabricated and illustrated march to \u201cmassive leaps\u201d in technologic advancement by the convergence of intelligent technologies [19]. Kurzweil in his writings took all of mankind\u2019s technologic advancements and attempted to do what Gordon Moore had done for just microprocessors, but he overlaid them in graphic formats to see what is happening. He then explained that almost every aspect of modern technology is rapidly expanding at exponential growth rates. The exception is computer or intelligent technology itself which is expanding at a double exponential rate. That is to say, that its rate of growth is itself exponential!",

The methods that we\u2019ve alluded to throughout this textbook have evolved and followed the trends that we have just been talking about. Celsus gave way to the Marian approach, which in turn gave way to the lateral perineal lithotomy, which gave way to Civiale\u2019s pioneering lithotrity, which became obsolete with Bigelow\u2019s litholapaxy, which has been antiquated by the holmium: YAG laser, and bladder stones themselves became a historical oddity by improved dietary nutrition, and open renal stone surgery is rarely indicated any longer, despite the rapid increase in new stone sufferers. The literature is nearly impossible to keep up with, the newer technologies are hard to place into perspective, but the abilities of our technology to change what we are doing currently is ever more likely [25].

The computer chip comes from germanium or silicon solid-state transistors that were first of two Nobel Prizes in physics for John Bardeen (the only physicist to win two Nobel Prizes in physics) [29]. In 1950, ENIAC at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania was the first modern electronic computer with the essential features found on current computers. By the early 1950s, microprocessors began to be conceptualized, and computers began to make their way into scientific and business accounting [30]. In the summer of 1956, John McCarthy who founded the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) along with Marvin Minsky (then at MIT), started a 6-week workshop at Dartmouth College on \u201cArtificial Intelligence.\u201d There were 12 original participants in the prophetic group. The field of AI came into being when the concept of universal computation, the cultural view of the brain as a computer, and the availability of digital computing machines were combined [31]. The field of cybernetics came into being when concepts of information, feedback, and control were generalized from specific applications (i.e., in engineering) to systems in general, including systems of living organisms, abstract intelligent processes, and language. Already mentioned were Vannevar Bush\u2019s vital contributions with his view of the information revolution.

Stewart is the best place to start [32]. He notes that the word cybernetics was derived from the Greek kubernetes or steersman and was coined by Norbert Wiener a professor of mathematics at MIT. But like many things in history, everyone overlooked a little understood paper by James Clerk Maxwell from the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London in 1868 \u201cOn Governors\u201d [33]. Wiener started meeting with other young scientists monthly at Vanderbilt Hall in the early 1940s. One of the first investigators he met was a Harvard Medical School professor of physiology Arturo Rosenblueth. This pair would later team up during the war years to investigate a machine\u2019s ability to predict voluntary control (desperately needed for wartime anti-aircraft design systems). By 1943 these investigations were published in the Philosophy of Science called \u201cBehavior, purpose and teleology\u201d [32]. They specifically defined behavior as any change of an entity with respect to its surroundings. This began the scientific understanding of mechanized actions or the understanding of human behavior with mechanized processes. Their first classification separated active behavior, in which the object is itself the source of energy in the output, and non-active behavior or passive behavior in which all the energy in the output comes from the immediate output. The essence of their theories was based upon feedback loops for control; the mathematics was just beginning at this time. They stated, \u201cthe broad classes of behavior are the same in machines and in living organisms\u2026.while the behavioristic analysis of machines and living organisms is largely uniform, their functional study reveals deep differences\u201d [32]. Wiener and Rosenbleuth\u2019s ideas would begin to stimulate formal scientific investigation when the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation organized a series of scientific meetings to fertilize new methods of investigation throughout the 1940s. By the 1950s the term \u201ccybernetics\u201d was increasingly utilized to describe much of the scientific investigation of control mechanisms, digital processing, and of course computer technologies and intelligent systems.",

Now such artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been increasingly utilized in a wide and spectacular array of medical uses: diagnosis (echocardiography, brain mapping, lung scans, and prostate biopsy readings), therapy (gastroesophageal reflux algorithms), effect of treating (methadone in addiction), Alzheimer disease therapies, and modeling obesity outcomes [34].

About 15 years ago, when DNA sequencing was in its infancy, it was estimated that it would take thousands of years to sequence every base pair on the whole of human chromosomes. But the entire sequence was completed in just under 15 years at a cost of several millions of dollars. In fact, you can now purchase your very own DNA sequencer and perform this amazing feet of biotechnology yourself at home. Another example would be the 15 years it took to sequence the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but only 31 days to unravel the SARS virus. Sequencing is following the same exponential technologic growth pathway that applies to computers, intelligent technologies, and everything else we\u2019ve used as examples (Table 32.1) [37].

The first living cells housing nanoscale biomachines evolved 3.5 billion years ago. In 400 BC Democritus coined the word \u201catom,\u201d thought to be the basis of all matter. In 1931 Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska developed the electron microscope for subnanometer imaging. In 1959 Richard Feynman gave the prophetic lecture predicting the rise of nanotechnologies. In 1968 Alfred Y. Cho and John Arthur of Bell labs invented molecular-beam epitaxy to deposit single atomic layers on a surface. In 1974 Norio Taniguchi conceived the word \u201cnanotechnology.\u201d In 1981 Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer created a scanning tunneling microscope, which can image individual atoms [5]. By 1985 Robert F. Curl, Jr., Harold W. Kroto, and Richard E. Smalley discovered buckminsterfullerenes, also known as buckyballs, which measure about 1 nm in diameter (1996 Nobel Prize) [43]. These are 12 carbon compounds that are made from the vapors of carbon dust and form very structurally sound covalent bonds. The carbon buckminsterfullerenes provide almost 1,000 times the strength of steel and have the capacity to auto-organize themselves if damaged.

Nanoshells are small beads of glass coated with gold that can absorb light, particularly near-infrared, which can be beamed into the body. These nanoshells could then be induced from an extracorporeal strong infrared source to be heated. Buckyballs can be made from just a few dozen carbon atoms. The potential for the future of nanotechnology like many other futuristic applications to medicine is unknown. But it is intriguing to speculate about the possibilities.

As the rise of stone surgery is almost entirely dependent upon the technology and skill of the surgeon, there has been increased emphasis on comparing the surgeon to the airline pilot. In aviation, the pilot is expected to perform with a risk of failure less than 0.0001 %. Complications in surgery occur in the range of 1\u20135 % or more, this is a factor of 100\u00d7 more than in the airline industry. Many operative modifications have been instituted to control preventable errors in the operating room, but truthfully not many of these actually apply to stone patients. For instance, wrong site errors are not even a realistic probability in patients with stones; though patients can present with bilateral stones, there are no real reported cases of this phenomenon. The errors in stone disease management can come from lack of skill; a surgeon, for instance, elects to perform one procedure when another is likely to benefit the patient preferentially, or unexpected anatomical variation makes an approach risky. The most common scenario is a large renal stone that might best be managed with a percutaneous nephrostomy and an antegrade nephroscopic approach that the surgeon may not be comfortable performing. All too often, a shock wave lithotripsy is chosen because sadly the reimbursement level is higher than some more applicable method. Our system of reimbursement in the United States has evolved into a nightmare of complexity and one that no longer reflects upon reality [46]. These financial disincentives have to be considered in a realistic discussion of error and more often than not are disregarded or relegated to the backroom discussion [47]. Atul Gwande mentions the notion of professionalism that would normally be considered the check to such unprofessional behavior. He states, \u201cAll learned occupations have a definition of professionalism, a code of conduct. It is where they spell out their ideals and duties. The codes are sometimes stated, sometimes just understood. But they all have at least three common elements. First is an expectation of selflessness\u2026second is an expectation of skill\u2026third is an expectation of trustworthiness\u201d [48]. These are truly great expectations for rules of professionalism in an era of spending cutbacks, limitations in hours, financial cliffs, and rising malpractice costs. But a patient is on the other end of this professionalism equation and that can never be forgotten.",

Now with the Internet, consumerism, the Baby Boomers aging, risk adjustment, outcomes measurement, and quality metrics, blind trust in clinicians has begun to erode\u201d [49]. It is hard to find confidence in a system that appears to be spiraling out of control. Two sentinel studies that were used by the Institute of Medicine to generate their pronouncements in To Err Is Human came from the 1991 Results of the Harvard Medical Practice Study I & II [50, 51]. The first study was a retrospective review of 30,121 randomly selected records from 51 randomly selected places in New York State in 1984. They found adverse events in 3.7 % of these hospitalizations and 27.6 % of these were secondary to negligence. They found that 70.5 % of these errors resulted in disability that persisted for less than 6 months, 2.6 % resulted in permanent disability, and 13.6 % led to the patient\u2019s death [50]. Their second piece immediately followed looking at the nature of these errors. Drug complications were the most common adverse event (19 %), wound infections in 14 %, and technical complications in 13 %. The major area that was isolated was diagnostic errors in 75 % and what were called \u201cnoninvasive therapeutic mishaps\u201d or errors of omission (77 %) [51]. The other major study utilized by the Institute of Medicine was Costs of Medical Injuries in Utah and Colorado published in 1999 [52]. This also was a largely Harvard School of Public Health endeavor. In this evaluation they identified 459 adverse events, of which 265 were preventable from 14,732 randomly selected discharges from 28 hospitals. The costs associated with adverse events equaled $348,081,000 and about \u00bd of that number from the preventable errors [52]. Clearly the technologies that we have presented could solve many, if not most, of these errors as time goes on and the cost savings in error prevention would pay for the technology. The professionalism of those involved was not evaluated, nor is there a method to evaluate this quality of the health caregivers. The Institute of Medicine followed their first publication with recommendations for fixing the trouble US healthcare system with a second, Crossing the Quality Chasm [53]. In this volume they begin with \u201cThe American health delivery system is in need of fundamental change. Many patients, doctors, nurses, and health care leaders are concerned that the care delivered is not, essentially, the care we should receive.\u201d In nine chapters they proceed to relate how they think that a new and improved health system can be created.",

            "text": "How does all of this apply to the history of urolithiasis and what are the implications to the treatment of stone disease? In a related paper in the Journal of Urology in 2001, a survey of urologic medical malpractice cases was reported. They were able to identify 259 medical malpractice claims from 1995 to 1999. The average urologist gets sued for malpractice twice in his career and certain parts of the country were worse than others (Southeastern > North Central >South Central > New England > Mid-Atlantic > Western > New York) [54]. They also noted that the most common procedure-specific claim was for endoscopic procedures (22 %) with most being stone patients. In another study involving malpractice litigation in one state, New York, 469 urologic claims occurred between 1985 and 2004 with a remarkably constant 22 claims annually during this period. Claims based on endourologic procedures (mostly stones) were the second leading cause of malpractice claims in NYS, second only to oncologic operations (25 vs. 46) [55]. In a follow-up on this same group of malpractice claims, missed diagnosis led to malpractice claims in 75 cases, and only two of these were stone related, both kidney stones [56]. Now getting to the stone group and a different group of investigators but still looking at New York State from 2005 to 2010, we can gather even better information. There were 25/585 closed claims that were related to endourology (4.3 %). Sixteen of these cases were women and nine were men. Twenty-two of these cases involved stones; the remaining three were from ureteral obstruction. Cystoscopy and stent placement accounted for most of the suits (52 %) followed by ureteroscopic lithotripsy (32 %), shock wave lithotripsy (8 %), and percutaneous procedures (8 %). Sixteen patients (62 %) required secondary procedures following their complications and six (24 %) died, all from sepsis. Ureteral stones were the major culprits in about 80 % of these cases [57]. Things go wrong far more commonly than medical malpractice cases get filed in our tort system. With the emphasis on the historical perspective, in fact, things go wrong a lot less commonly now than at any previous time in surgical history. Yet our stone patients are still dying on our watch; complications are still occurring with some degree of regularity. Though communication with the patient and the family has been widely proclaimed along with excellent documentation to help minimize the threat of the lawsuit, what about preventing the errors that result in injury of unintended outcomes to begin with?",

In the past two decades an increase in calcium phosphate stones has been noted in the United States, with females being more common than males [58]. We have seen that brushite stone formation is often concurrent with apatite plugging of the papillary tubules leading to fibrosis and permanent renal injury. This is becoming an increasingly disconcerting trend in urolithiasis and should serve as a warning to those of us who see and treat many recurrent stone formers to be ever vigilant to this possible conversion to a worse scenario [59]. In addition, it appears that our interventions in stone formers by repeated shock wave lithotripsy in particular might indeed be damaging the kidney itself and also contributing to the transformation from calcium oxalate stones to calcium phosphate stones [60].",

But our abilities to gauge success have improved, and CT scanning posttreatment is much better on finding pieces of stone than was the KUB. One thing is certain: if a shock wave lithotripsy fails to break up the stone, odds are given our current technologies that another method should be utilized in subsequent interventions. Multiple, serial shock wave lithotripsies should not be considered the method of choice for dealing with non-fragmentable stones [61]. In addition, in skilled hands the holmium:YAG (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) mid-infrared laser remains currently unsurpassed and the most effective lithotripter source in the surgical armamentarium in the urologist\u2019s arsenal. With ureteroscopes evolving into smaller and improved optical capacity, there are virtually no regions within the kidney or ureter that can avoid these diminutive scopes\u2019 abilities. But complications can and do occur, but with systems in place to carefully monitor performance and follow-up of patients, one could speculate that Six Sigma (or 1/million) might not be achievable soon, but the aviation standard of 1/10,000 just might. Anesthesia using Six Sigma tools has now dropped its serious complication rate down or \u201cmishaps\u201d to near 1/200,000 [62]. Let us focus our attention on this amazing and truly underappreciated bit of fact. Ellison Pierce was fixated on the notion that unacceptable numbers of serious complications occurred in anesthesia and when he was elected to be vice president of the American Society of Anesthesiology in 1982 he had opportunity to do something about it. He recruited an engineer named Jeffrey Cooper who utilized a technique referred to as \u201ccritical incident analysis\u201d to begin a systematic approach to all aspects of the anesthesia/patient interaction [63]. The first in-depth analysis of 359 errors broke the whole process of anesthesia down in sections which were then attacked by solving or developing solutions to problems\u2014utilizing pulse oximeters, placing end-tidal CO2 monitors on anesthesia machines, and standardization of anesthesia machines and even the dials on the gas cylinders [63]. Others are just beginning to follow this pathway, but with the evolution of technology occurring as it is by quantum leaps, why should stone disease management have to wait much longer?",

Polymer science, microcomputerization, optical engineering, bioengineering, and many other technologic arenas are being focused upon advanced healthcare delivery. Surgery has not been immune to such technologic advancement. The precise extent and overall impact of new, minimal access urologic surgeries has almost certainly not yet achieved its limits. This logarithmic growth in minimally invasive stone procedures reflects both the clinician\u2019s abilities to adapt to new technology and also the patient\u2019s themselves desiring centers where such methods are being utilized. With the rapid dissemination of knowledge by mass media, an ever increasingly informed society is seeking alternative therapy for heretofore conventional open operations. Minimal access surgery is a redefinition of the term for technologically advanced surgery originally coined by J.E.A. Wickham in 1987, referred to as the \u201cnew surgery or minimally invasive surgery.\u201d [64] These terms are just a method of quantifying the degree of surgical trauma inflicted upon patients. Laparoscopic surgery has been correctly pointed out by Cuschieri to produce minimal access trauma but still imparts surgical trauma. Minimal invasive surgery is the next echelon vis-\u00e0-vis further reduction of risk and trauma for patients [65]. This type of surgery does minimize trauma by eliminating direct organ dissection and cutting through the bodies walls via \u201cclassic\u201d methods. Endoscopic surgeries next reduce the trauma by proceeding through natural orifices to gain access to the stones (in our focused case) in the urinary tract. Shock wave lithotripsy eliminates any invasion through the body or via any natural orifices and utilizes high-energy shock waves to comminute the calculus. But one might correctly assume that this technologic advance is not quite finished and that newer, safer alternatives might yet be invented.",

In the earliest surgical days of perineal lithotomy, mortality was age dependent and greater than 50 % of the patients died and probably many more suffered irreversible harm. Cheselden with his scrupulous separation of \u201cobserved\u201d cases from his private practice (unobserved cases) reported statistics only on the former. Even with the development of transurethral lithotrity, there was an impressive mortality. Patients and surgeons were inured with death, suffering, and morbidity. We fortunately have evolved beyond this pain and suffering with great expectation to advance even further. Most of us have lived through two revolutionary eras of urologic practice: the endoscopic treatment of prostatic disease and the abdication of open stone surgery. Wickham has chosen the latter to represent the traumas inflicted upon our patients and the result of technology on reducing them. Progressing from open stone surgery through percutaneous nephrostolithotripsy and including first- and second-generation shock wave lithotripsy therapy, patients are subject to less and less interventional trauma [68]. The results are dramatically reduced hospital stays, faster return to normal activities, and patients who are very aware of their good fortune. In one decade, urologists have progressed in the treatment of stone disease further than any other surgical specialty though this too is changing.",

By 1901 a standardized method of case reporting had been developed at Johns Hopkins Medical School. This was an attempt by early health professionals, physicians, and nurses to investigate the outcomes of care (Osler with the blackboard). This became mandated in the United States by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in 1983. Unexpended findings at autopsy also were historically significant in evaluating the cause of death. Lundberg noted 40 % discrepancy between antemortem and postmortem diagnoses in 1998 [70]. Autopsies have continuously declined throughout the twentieth century. In the 1940s autopsy rates were typically at 50 %, but currently they are performed in less than 9 % of hospital deaths. Stone disease no longer has the high mortality rates that were ascribed to the past, but they still rarely occur. It is the morbidity that is frequently associated with stone disease presently that is of concern and the rising rates of prevalence of this disease. The perfect storm situation that underscores the concern for this morbidity is the overuse of shock wave lithotripsy in some regions for kidney stones, possibly because the reimbursement for this modality is so much higher than equally or in some cases more effective therapies [46]. When reimbursement begins to have a factor in the decision for therapy, there are all kinds of ethical concerns that come into play, outcomes typically not being foremost in consideration. Our hope for the future of technology is that it will solve this dilemma as well as make safer, less invasive methods readily available to urolithiasis sufferers.",

This picture symbolizes the confluence of technologies that now offers the promise of improving human lives in many ways, and the realignment of traditional disciplinary boundaries that will be needed to realize this potential. New and more direct pathways towards human goals are envisioned in working habits, in economic activity, and in the humanities\u201d [16]\u2014thus begins the first National Science Foundation/Department of Commerce-sponsored scientific meeting on technologic convergence on June 2002 in Arlington, Virginia. Called \u201cConverging Technologies for Improving Human Performance,\u201d this government-sponsored conference covered all aspects of rapidly expanding technologies [16]. We have spent a good bit of this chapter discussing the exponential growth of divergent technologies\u2014nano, bio, info, and cogno. What happens when they start to blur and combine to achieve the same ends? This is indeed what is happening. The old constraints of specialization are being wiped out by the supercomputing systems currently being implemented. Computers are becoming so powerful and fast that autoengineering systems are not only capable; they are the only method that can create the computer chips that are being used by the computers. This technology is crossing over to other design systems, engineering, and research and development. In other words, as intelligent technologies rapidly become more intelligent, the pace of change is further accelerated. The technology that will be with us tomorrow is definitely not with us currently. As with buying a computer currently, you can wait until the next bigger, faster, more sophisticated system becomes available and you will end up waiting forever. Or, you can scratch your head and get into the technology and become inspired to seek and discover all you can that the technology can offer.
