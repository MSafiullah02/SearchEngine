Child-Pugh scores did not differ between survivors or nonsurvivors (12.8 versus 12.3, P \u03ed 0.26), however APACHE II scores (P \u03ed 0.007), acute physiology scores (P \u03ed 0.006), and Karnofsky scores (P \u03ed 0.001) were significant predictors of outcome. By univariate analysis, requirement of mechanical ventilation analysis (P \u03ed 0.001), duration of mechanical ventilation (P \u03ed 0.001), pulmonary infiltrates (P \u03ed 0.0001), infections (P \u03ed 0.047), gastrointestinal bleeding (P \u03ed 0.005), and serum creatinine \u03fe1.5mg/dl (P \u03ed 0.0005) were significantly associated with mortality. By logistic regression analysis only pulmonary infiltrates (P \u03ed 0.0001) and renal dysfunction (P \u03ed 0.041) were independent predictors of mortality. When controlled for the severity of illness (APACHE II scores), the mortality in patients with cirrhosis caused by alcohol was significantly lower than that in patients with liver disease not caused by alcohol (P \u03ed 0.01). Our study not only identified predictors of poor outcome in patients with cirrhosis requiring ICU care but also provided data that may have implications for optimal timing for transplantation.",

Admission vital signs, Karnofsky score, and laboratory data (complete blood count, BUN, creatinine, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, prothrombin partial thromboplastin times, serum cholesterol, albumin, and electrolytes) were also recorded. The APACHE scoring system is the most widely employed severity-of-illness scale in the ICU studies. 15 The APACHE II score was calculated at the time of the ICU admission by adding the acute physiology score (APS), chronic health points, and age points. 15 It has also been shown that preadmission functional status of the patient is an important determinant of the outcome in critically ill patients. 15, 16 We employed the Karnofsky performance score to assess the functional status of the study patients. 17 During the ICU stay, the following variables were recorded: invasive procedures (requirement for pulmonary artery catheter, arterial line, tracheostomy, endoscopy, bronchoscopy); total parenteral or enteral nutrition; inotropic or vasopressor support; requirement for and duration of mechanical ventilation; dialysis; infections; and presence of pulmonary infiltrates and their etiology. The criteria for diagnosing nosocomial pneumonia, 16 adult respiratory distress syndrome, 18 pulmonary edema, 19 and peritonitis 20 were as previously reported. Statistical analysis. Patient demographics and laboratory values were entered into a database (Prophet, BBN Systems and Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA). Contingency tables were analyzed using the 2 or Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were compared using the t-test or Mann-Whitney test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done in stepwise fashion with variables being entered to the equation if the significance level was less than 0.1 and removed from the equation if greater than 0.15. 21 The pool of variables available for analysis was chosen from variables that were significant by univariate analysis and considered to be of clinical importance (factors that could possibly be altered by management in the ICU).",

Child-Pugh scores failed to predict the outcome, whereas APACHE II scores, APS scores, and functional status of the patient (Karnofsky score) were more accurate predictors of outcome. The lack of predictive accuracy of Child-Pugh scores is probably because extrahepatic severity-of-illness variables, e.g., renal function, vital signs, and pulmonary status, are not measured by Child-Pugh scores, although these scores do assess a number of different criteria related to the liver disease.",

The prognostic significance of hyperbilirubinemia and elevated prothrombin time has also been recognized in patients with other medical conditions requiring ICU care. In a study assessing outcome in ICU patients treated with hemodialysis for acute renal failure, serum bilirubin and prothrombin time were significantly associated with mortality; hyperbilirubinemia was an independent predictor of mortality. 22 Bilirubin was also a significant predictor of outcome in transplant recipients requiring ICU care 4 and of early graft failure in liver transplant candidates undergoing transplantation. 23 We observed a high incidence of renal dysfunction in our patients with cirrhosis admitted to the ICU. Renal impairment (creatinine more than 1.5mg/dl) was present in 76% of the patients, and 20% of the patients required dialysis. Patients requiring dialysis were significantly more ill (as assessed by APACHE II scores). However, when controlled for the severity of illness, renal impairment (P \u03ed 0.014) and dialysis (P \u03ed 0.017) remained significantly associated with mortality in the ICU. The grave prognostic association of renal failure in endstage liver disease was also emphasized in a recent Spanish study. Renal impairment after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis was reported to be the most significant predictor of hospital mortality. 24 These data have important implications regarding timing of transplantation. Patients with endstage liver disease and renal impairment are at high risk for mortality. However, transplantation should ideally be undertaken before renal failure and the requirement for dialysis ensue. Pretransplant renal dysfunction was an independent predictor of early graft failure after liver transplantation 25, 26 and pretransplant dialysis has been identified as a significant risk factor for early posttransplant mortality and infectious morbidity. [27] [28] [29] [30] Nearly one-third of our patients with cirrhosis in the ICU experienced infections. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bacteremia have been reported in 7%-15% and 4%-10% of patients with cirrhosis, respectively. 31 Our incidence of SBP (35%) and bacteremia (20%) was therefore somewhat higher than that reported in cirrhotic patients in general. This was likely reflective of the fact that our patients represented a subgroup of most critically ill patients with liver disease. Although mortality was higher in the infected patients, infections were not an independent predictor of mortality. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and enterococcus were the most frequent causes of culture-positive SBP or spontaneous bacteremia; however, culturenegative neutrocytic ascites was the most frequently observed variant of SBP. Patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment, and those requiring dialysis were at significantly higher risk for infections in the ICU. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been shown to impair the reticuloendothelial function and facilitate bacterial translocation across the gut. 32, 33 Likewise, the association of renal failure with infections is well recognized.",

The mortality in these patients (81%) was comparable to that of patients with documented infections in the ICU (60%). We hypothesize that this clinical presentation may likely be caused by enhanced production and decreased metabolism of cytokines, e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (1L)-6, which have been demonstrated in patients with endstage liver disease. 34 A systemic inflammatory response syndrome in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, in the absence of infections, has recently been described, with leukocyte activation in the peripheral blood of patients with cirrhosis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome correlated with the serum levels of 1L-6. 35 Mental status has been shown to be a significant predictor of outcome in ICU patients in a number of clinical settings, e.g., patients with acute renal failure requiring dialysis and transplant recipients. 4, 36 Although encephalopathy was the predominant reason for ICU admission in our patients, no association between the presence or absence of encephalopathy, the degree of encephalopathy (stage I, II, or III) or coma scores (APACHE) was demonstrated in our study.

Although Child-Pugh scores, serum bilirubin, creatinine, or the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was not different, the patients with liver disease not caused by alcohol may have been more debilitated, as indicated by a significantly greater requirement for mechanical ventilation and a higher incidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Nevertheless, the association of underlying liver disease with outcome has also been noted in transplant recipients. Higher graft and patient survival was observed in patients undergoing liver transplantation for cholestatic and alcoholic liver disease compared with other liver diseases, including hepatitis. 23 The vast majority of our patients with nonalcoholic liver disease had viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis C virus. It has been proposed that hepatitis C virus is an immunodulatory virus. 37 Greater infectious morbidity in patients with hepatitis C virus compared with patients without hepatitis C virus infection has been documented in transplant recipients. 38 In the nontransplant setting, T-cell-derived cytokine levels were significantly higher in patients with hepatitis C virus compared with normal controls. 39 Whether differences in cytokine profile, level, or expression were contributory variables to differential disease severity in patients with and without viral hepatitis in our study remains speculative.",
