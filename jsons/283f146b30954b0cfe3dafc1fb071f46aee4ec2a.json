In Canada, there were 375 probable and suspect cases between March and July 2003 with 44 deaths, reflecting a mortality rate of 11%. Spread of SARS was shown to be by airborne droplets and results in acute pulmonary inflammation and epithelial damage. 3 It has now been determined that a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, is the etiologic agent in SARS. Based on phylogenetic sequence analysis, it best fits within group 2 coronaviruses, which include the mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV). 4, 5 As for most infections, SARS varies considerably in terms of its clinical severity. This variation is almost certainly due to population-based diversity in the genes controlling the immune response. Clearance of mouse hepatitis virus coincides with a robust innate immune response, including increased numbers of CD8 T cells. Disease and death do not correlate with high viral titers, and it has been suggested that disease reflects alteration in host innate immune response. Furthermore, host production and response to type 1 interferons (IFN) is a key determinant of outcome in MHV-infected mice. 6 However, IFNs and other cytokines regulate in a coordinate manner both inflammation and the Th1/Th2 character of the specific immune response. An imbalance in timing and proportions of cellular responses to inflammatory cytokines after viral infection can lead to chronic disease or death. Although a number of models for SARS have been proposed including SARS-CoV infection of mice, of cats and ferrets, and SARS-CoV infection of non-human primates, none of the models produce lung pathology similar to that seen in humans and serve only as models where agents including neutralizing antibodies, putative vaccines, or anti-virals can be studied for effect on viral replication. 7, 8 MHV-1 was first isolated in 1950, and mice infected by MHV-1 had massive hepatic necrosis on autopsy. On further analysis, it was realized that MHV-1 infected mice were co-infected with Eperythrozoon coccoides. When mice were infected with MHV-1 devoid of this bacterium, only mild hepatitis was seen and all mice survived. As described below, the MHV-1 mouse model established in our laboratory offers the potential to provide insights into the pathogenesis of MHV-induced lung injury and the contribution of both the virus and host immune response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 387, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 616, "end": 618, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 619, "end": 620, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1222, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1902, "end": 1904, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1905, "end": 1906, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Mice: Female Balb/cJ, A/J, and C3H mice, 6-8 weeks of age, were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed in the animal facility of the Toronto General Research and were fed with standard laboratory chow diet and water ad libitum.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MATERIALS AND METHODS"}, {"text": "Virus: MHV-1, MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, MHV-S, and MHV-3 was originally obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and plaque purified on monolayers of DBT cells and titered on L2 cells using a standard plaque assay. 9 Tissue processing: Lungs, spleens, livers, kidneys, small intestines, hearts, and brains were harvested from mice and samples snap frozen and stored in a -80 o C freezer or fixed with 10% formalin for further analysis.

In addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, focal deposition of fibrin was seen around small arterial blood vessels and in alveolar spaces with entrapment of platelets. Changes were noted as early as 3 days p.i. and progressed to day 28. Clinically these mice became lethargic, with rapid respiration, but all of the mice survived and pulmonary pathology resolved within 21 days of infection. Balb/cJ mice infected intranasally with MHV-JHM developed neither liver or lung pathology. Although MHV-3 and MHV-A59 produced pulmonary lesions, these were milder than those generated by MHV-1 and did not have the characteristics of lesions caused by SARS. MHV-A59 and MHV-3 infected mice all developed severe hepatic necrosis and died of liver failure by day 10 and thus these strains of MHV do not represent relevant models of SARS (Table 1) . These data suggest that MHV-1 induces a pathology most similar to human SARS. Therefore, we infected 3 inbred strains of mice (C57Bl/6J, C3H/HeJ, and A/J mice) that have previously been known to show varying degrees of susceptibility to other strains of MHV. Although C57Bl/6J developed acute pulmonary disease, these mice all survived and the pulmonary lesions resolved by day 21. C3H/HeJ mice showed an intermediate pattern of resistance/susceptibility with 40% of mice dying by day 28. Surviving C3H mice developed pulmonary fibrosis and bronchial hyperplasia (Figure 2) . A/J mice all died within 7-10 days post-MHV-1 infection of severe pulmonary disease. Lungs showed 100% consolidated pneumonitis with hyaline membranes, fibrin deposition, and lymphocytic and macrophage infiltration ( Figure 1A) . We examined lung tissue from both susceptible A/J and resistant C57Bl/6J mice for presence of fgl2 mRNA transcripts by real-time PCR, protein, and fibrin, as fgl2 is known to cause thrombosis. Shown in Figure 1B , fgl2 protein was expressed by inflammatory cells and type 1 pneumocytes in juxtaposition with deposits of fibrin. Lungs from Balb/cJ and C57Bl/6 mice had neither fgl2 or fibrin deposits. Electron micrographs of lung showed virions mostly localized to type 1 pneumocytes and pulmonary macrophages (data not shown). By plaque assay, virus was detected in the lung by 12 hours, reaching maximal levels by 48-72 hours and in A/J mice persisted at high levels until death of animals. Virus was also detected in the lungs of C57Bl/6J mice by 12 hours p.i., reaching maximal levels by day 4 but disappearing by days 7-10 p.i. Serum was collected from A/J and C57Bl/6J mice pre and post MHV-1 infection and cytokines measured ( Table 2) . Gene expression levels for the different IFN\u03b1s and IFN-\u00df were assessed in lung tissues from MHV-1 infected C57Bl/6Jand A/J mice, using quantitative real-time PCR.
