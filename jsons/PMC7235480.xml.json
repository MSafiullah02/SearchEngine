This combination could prove useful and safer in terms of side effects than the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, especially in a home administration context. This is because azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine may influence the QT tract elongation and requires, therefore, electrocardiographic monitoring. In conclusion, low doxycycline doses in association with hydroxychloroquine might be a promising prophylactic and therapeutic strategy for the early phase of COVID\u201019. Clinical trials are needed to assess their efficacy and safety in suspected or confirmed COVID\u201019 patients.",
