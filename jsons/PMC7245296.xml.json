As of May 2020, around 4 million cases have been detected worldwide, with over 284,000 reported deaths. Great efforts are currently underway towards the characterization of the virus and the treatment of its disease. Without the possibility of a vaccine envisioned for the near future, disease containment has focused mainly on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at restricting the circulation of the population, as well as at reducing the risk of contagion in groups of vulnerable individuals. The choice of containment strategy is a key factor to forecast the local severity of the epidemic, as evidenced by the outcome of divergent public health policies adapted by different countries. It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of models to assess the outcome of alternative NPIs will play an important role in the formulation of new public health policies.",

The main goal of NPIs is to flatten the curve of total infected individuals, delaying the peak while keeping the number of cases within the capacity of the health system. Different countries have achieved this objective with varying degrees of success, which can at least be partially explained by their choice of NPIs. Thus, it becomes essential to measure the relative success of each case and to incorporate this knowledge into models capable of assisting decision makers in the formulation of new NPIs. As mentioned before, a key parameter that reflects the dynamics of the epidemics is the reproduction number. However, in [19] authors found that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number R\n0 is untenable in realistic populations, and provides very little understanding of the evolution of the epidemic. This departure from the classical theoretical picture is not due to behavioral factors and other exogenous epidemiological determinants. Rather, it can be simply explained by the (clustered) contact structure of the population. The authors also provided evidence that methodologies aimed at estimating the instantaneous reproduction number R(t) can be used operationally to characterize the correct dynamics of the epidemic from incidence data.",

It is important to note that even though NPIs can have a noticeable effect on the reproduction number R(t), their effects are not instantaneous; instead, they are modulated by the proper characteristic times of the disease. Since R(t) is an emergent quantity resulting from decreased social contact in large groups of individuals, proposals depending on the capacity to enforce sudden changes of the reproduction number (e.g. as in the modulation of infection rate by a periodic square function, as mentioned above) must be evaluated critically. One of the keys points for understanding the spreading of the disease is the variability in the contagion rate and its dependence on the density and movement of people within or between cities and regions. In this context, in [22] the authors used cell phone data from approximately 11 million devices to study how the flow of people through the city of Wuhan contributed to dispersing SARS-CoV-2 throughout China. The authors confirmed the efficacy of lockdown measures for decreasing mobility, and showed that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicted the relative frequency and geographic distribution of COVID-19 infections across China.",

We caution the reader to adopt a critical stance towards simple epidemiological models. Even when these models are fed with population census data and realistic mobility estimates, they are fundamentally limited in what they can tell us about the mid- to long-term evolution of the epidemic. While the simplest epidemiological models have several limitations of their own, building more complex models does not necessarily improve our understanding of the epidemic, and can certainly obfuscate the basic limitations that are intrinsic to the very foundations of the models. Here, models are considered only as ways of exploring the possible future courses of the epidemic, without claims of accuracy, let alone of infallibility. Claims concerning the outcomes of public policies based solely on numerical simulations should be approached with utmost care. The situation is both novel and challenging, full of unknowns that cannot be dispelled by comparison with previous epidemics, and several of the proposed NPIs (such as the enforcement of periodic lockdowns, or the pursuit of massive herd immunity) are unheard of in modern public health policy. The cost of implementing such policies could be huge, and failures could be even costlier. When advising public policy makers, it is our position that models, no matter how detailed, only represent one among multiple sources of information, and should supplement the analysis of actual data, the epidemiological situation, and the advice of public health experts.",

We consider focal dynamics and how they may lead towards the homogenization of the epidemics (Sec. 4). Then, after estimating relevant parameters from fitting the models to local data in Sec. 5, we consider coupled models (Sec. 6) and the role of mobility as estimated from cell phone data (Sec. 7). We incorporate this data to deterministic and stochastic models, discussing their comparative weaknesses and advantages, and use them to forecast the number of new cases based on possible changes to the isolation policy.

Argentina has a total population of nearly 45 millions, distributed between 23 federal states (provinces), plus an autonomous city (the city of Buenos Aires, or CABA). Most of the population lives in this city (2.9 millions) plus its suburbs (the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, Greater Buenos Aires or AMBA, plus nearby districts, totaling 40 districts with a population over 13 millions). The next most populated regions are the rest of the province of Buenos Aires (PBA), and the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Santa Fe. The first officially confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 was an infected traveler coming from abroad identified on March 3rd. On March 11th, all travellers from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases were requested to stay in isolation for 14 days. Schools and universities were closed on March 16th, and a complete lockdown was enforced on March 19th. Almost immediately afterwards, borders were closed except for flights bringing stranded Argentinians back from abroad, and vice-versa for foreigners. As a result of these measures, the number of infectious travelers slowly increased until reaching a maximum, and then decreased monotonously with time (see Fig. 1\n). The nationwide lockdown was maintained until April 26th, when provinces with zero or very few cases were allowed to relax lockdown rules. In contrast, densely populated areas (over 500,000 inhabitants) or with a large number of confirmed cases were maintained in strict lockdown for at least two more weeks, with the possibility of further extensions to the lockdown.",

However, since the COVID-19 epidemic started with travelers coming from other countries, modeling the increase of infected individuals solely as an interaction with the compartment of exposed individuals will fail to reproduce the early dynamics of the disease. As discussed next, considering the contribution of these individuals results in more reasonable estimates of the disease transmission rate, which are in better agreement with those obtained in other countries by other methods [2], [9], [10], [18]. We thus briefly summarize how to include incoming infectious individuals in the simplest models, and then adopt the same mechanism when developing more complicated models in the following sections.",

(1)-(3) is important when the number of infectious individuals is small, since in those situations fluctuations can lead to the extinction of the epidemic, even for a highly contagious disease (this can happen, for instance, if the first few infectious individuals had very limited contact with the susceptible population). Typically, an epidemic outbreak starts with few infectious cases that are spatially scattered. If the mobility of those cases is small, the epidemic will first develop in scattered foci and then slowly spread until all the interconnected susceptible subjects interact with the infectious population, reaching what is known as the homogeneous situation, described, e.g., by the system of Eqs.  (4)-(7). Typically, the deterministic model used to describe the homogeneous case is therefore thought as the appropriate way to address the evolution of an epidemic outbreak involving a large number of individuals. However, it can also serve as an estimation of the result obtained by analyzing an ensemble of stochastic simulations. To this end, in this section we consider inhomogeneous distributions of infectious cases as obtained by coupling stochastic epidemic models as those in Eqs.  (1)-(3).",

We assumed that the population could be grouped into 15 regions (where the number was chosen to reproduce the internal division of the city of Buenos Aires into so-called \u201ccommunes\u201d, note these are smaller and different from the districts in the suburbs considered later). The number of inhabitants in each commune was obtained from census data. In our numerical experiments, each subject spends half of the day in its commune and a second half either in the same or a different one (the full mathematical details of the coupled stochastic model are described later in Sec. 6). In the first half of the day, the probability of contagion in the jth commune is given by:(19)PEj(t)=1\u2212exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03942Ij(t)/Nj),giving rise to a number of new exposed individuals Ej(t+\u03942)=Bin(Sj(t),PEj(t)). In the second part of the day, we use a mobility matrix [27] to estimate m\ni,j, the proportion of residents from the ith commune that travel to work in the jth commune. In this way, the number of people that will be found in the jth commune during the second part of the day is Nj(t+\u03942)=\u2211k=115mk,j, leading to \u2211k=115mk,jIk(t+\u03942)/Nk infectious people. Therefore, in this part of the day, the probability of contagion is:(20)PEj(t)=1\u2212exp[\u2212\u03b2\u03942\u2211k=115mk,jIk(t+\u03942)\u2211k=115mk,j].We can now compute the number I\nj,i of infectious individuals in the jth commune which are residents of the ith commune as Ij,i=Bin(mi,jSi(t+\u03942),PEj(t+\u03942)). Adding all the communes, we obtain,(21)Ej(t+1)=\u2211kBin(mj,kSj(t+\u03942)/Nj,PEk(t+\u03942))This method of updating stochastic models every half day will be found useful in the following sections, when we use cell phone data to estimate actual mobility between larger districts.",

The number of infectious individuals quickly drops to zero in some realizations, while in others infectious cases persist for longer times. The mean time for the extinction of the focus can be estimated from such an ensemble. This is also shown in Fig. 4, which presents this time as a function of the size of the population in the focus.

These two values were then interpolated with a logistic function to obtain a smooth version of \u03b2(t) for the model (as will be shown later from the analysis of cell phone data, this is in agreement with observations that the mobility of individuals decreases slowly in time, starting even before the lockdown is put in place). To produce forecasts using the model, it is necessary to calculate the errors that occur when estimating \u03b2(t) in this way. We thus also fitted the model to the data using least squares with a moving window of 10 days to estimate the dispersion \u03c3\u03b2 in the values of \u03b2(t).

This indicates the need of factoring individual mobility in the analysis, which will be shown next to correlate with the observed behavior of \u03b2(t). Also, note that the uncertainty of solutions within 95% confidence intervals increases very rapidly, thus forbidding reliable long-term forecasts of the number of cases.

We observe that the stochastic model either provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the cumulative number of cases (e.g., for Lujn, Vicente Lpez, and CABA), or underestimates the official data. An opposite result was observed for some of the districts modeled with the coupled deterministic model (i.e., Vicente Lpez). This difference could stem from the fact that, as opposed to the ODEs, the stochastic model can reproduce regional extinctions in the progression of the daily number of cases (unless driven by other region through the mixing matrix).

We asked whether such overall change in mobility sufficed to explain the goodness of fit of our models, or whether the finer structure of the mixing matrix and the local mobility estimates also played a significant role. For this purpose, we compared the results against a null model obtained from repeating the above presented simulations across 1000 independent realizations, randomly scrambling the ordering of the regions in the mixing matrix M\ni,j and in the infection rate vector \u03b2i. Note that both variables were scrambled only once per simulation, i.e., not once per time step. Finally, we derived a p-value by counting the number of times the goodness of fit (computed as the inverse of the mean squared error [MSE]) of the model with shuffled M\ni,j and \u03b2i was better than the one obtained from the unshuffled data. We conclude that the structure of the empirical mixing matrix plays a significant role in the goodness of fit of our predictions, since the average MSE is higher for the shuffled than for the unshuffled mixing matrix (p < 0.001, and p < 0.05 for 17 of the regions). Conversely, we did not find a significant effect of the local mobility. This is consistent with cursory observations that suggest higher heterogeneity in the inter-regional mobility compared to the local circulation.",

Making these models more complex does not necessarily improve their forecasting capabilities, specially in a situation in which solutions (and small differences) grow, in some cases, exponentially in time.
