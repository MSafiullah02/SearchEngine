SARS has rapidly spread worldwide and there were in total 8098 reported cases with 774 fatalities at July 31st, 2003 (World Health Organization, 2003a). An on\u2010going controversial topic is the estimation of the fatality rate of SARS. The usual definition of the fatality rate that has been adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) is the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to the cumulative number of infected people in the course of the epidemic (World Health Organization, 2003b). This is often called the case fatality rate and is assumed to be a constant.",

For example, in the midst of the SARS outbreak at April 15th, 2003, the fatality rate in Hong Kong was 4.5% according to the WHO estimate, but it hit a record high of 17.0% at the end of the epidemic. Furthermore, the WHO estimate cannot reflect the changing fatality rate over the course of the epidemic in a timely manner owing to the use of cumulative data in the calculation. The WHO estimates of the fatality rates of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Beijing and Toronto were 17.0%, 13.9%, 10.7%, 6.5% and 15.8% at July 31st, 2003, respectively.

(2003) were the first to apply a survival analysis framework to analyse the SARS data and to estimate the time delay distributions of the times since infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death and admission to discharge. They assumed a fixed probability \u03c0 (the case fatality rate) and 1\u2212\u03c0 for the respective outcomes of death and recovery for each in\u2010patient on admission during the whole course of the epidemic. Their approach projected an estimate of the case fatality rate, and the estimate depends on whether the age of the patient is over 60 years or not. Their formulation can also be easily extended to a mixture of regression or threshold models to incorporate exogenous variables. In this setting, the constant case fatality rate is often interpreted as a measure of the severity or virulence of an infectious disease.",

When modelling this rate, there is no need to model the infectious process as our interest is in measuring the fatality that is inflicted by the epidemic. Also, the duration of hospitalization of individual patients is not taken into account since the initiation of hospitalization of an SARS patient is dependent on several factors, including the very early screening of hospital staff who are exposed, leading to detection and hospitalization of very early and asymptomatic disease, which is in contrast with the reluctance of some cases to seek medical attention, thereby delaying their hospitalization in the process. In this paper, we call this rate the realtime fatality rate. The rapid accumula\u2010 tion of experience and knowledge on the diagnosis, investigation and management, along with different age groups being affected at different times, compounded by differences in viral loads and other confounding factors, do not permit the assumption of a constant rate throughout the period of the outbreak . To monitor the fatality of an emerging epidemic, an estimator for such a time\u2010specific rate at the population level should be used to assess the efficacy of treatment in realtime, especially when the disease is rapidly evolving. For instance, there is also considerable controversy on the treatment of SARS (Wenzel and Edmond, 2003). The efficacy of ribavirin and corticosteroids, which were commonly used in Hong Kong for an empirical treatment of SARS, is not proven by controlled trial studies that were impossible to organize during the initial outbreak. In the absence of large scale clinical trials to assess the efficacy of various treatments, investigators are interested in the estimation of the realtime fatality rate over the course of the epidemic with a broad assessment of the effect of other factors, including variation in clinical management and other exogenous (including unidentified or unspecified) factors over the course of the outbreak.",

The in\u2010patients are subject to death, or recovery or to remain in the hospital over the course of the epidemic. Here, the timescale of interest is the calendar time, rather than the usual time to event from admission in standard survival analysis studies as in Donnelly et al. (2003). A new measure termed the realtime fatality rate is proposed in this paper and is defined as the probability of death conditioned on a transition to death or recovery at time t. This formulation can therefore model the fatality rate in realtime for the infected community in a macro perspective. Since rate estimates from survival models are usually estimated as step functions, a kernel method is used to smooth the estimates of the transition rates for recovery and death at time t, and for the realtime fatality rate. This realtime fatality rate is also useful in providing information on the efficacy of certain treatments and on the management of the disease during the outbreak of the disease. The approximate pointwise confidence limits of the respective transition and the realtime fatality rates are readily available. The method is applied to the SARS data from the regions affected, namely Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, Taiwan and Beijing.",

All patients with probable SARS were diagnosed according to the criteria that were established by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2003b). Briefly, patients with probable SARS presented with high fever (temperature above 38\u00b0C), coughing or breathing difficulty, contact history with SARS patients and pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia on chest radiographs or high resolution computed tomog\u2010raphy of the thorax that could not be explained by an alternative diagnosis (Tsang, Mok, Wong and Ooi, 2003). The criteria from the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2003) do not require microbiological confirmation although most patients with SARS in Hong Kong have positive serological evidence of SARS coronavirus infection, i.e. a significant rise in immunoglobulin G after a period of 21 days (Peiris et al., 2003).",

The primary target of most medical treatments and policies for lethal epidemics such as SARS is to lower the fatality rate during the outbreak of the epidemic, i.e. to lower the force of death relative to recovery, rather than necessarily to shorten the period of hospitalization. Hence a measure of treatment efficacy should be time sensitive (calendar time but not chronological time) and focus on their effects on death and recovery. By considering these two outcomes as competing \u2018risks\u2019 as in Yip and Lam (1992), we can obtain a realtime fatality rate which serves well for treatment or policy evaluation during the epidemic. The two risks, which are not necessarily independent, are assumed to operate simultaneously on the in\u2010patients. Since the times of the outbreak in SARS\u2010affected areas are different, we have different time origins (different calendar times) for different regions depending on the time of onset of the SARS epidemic and the availability of the data, with all areas followed longitudinally up to June 30th, 2003. The method proposed makes use of the information only on the cumulative number of deaths, cumulative number of discharges and SARS patients who are still in hospital on day t (for the Hong Kong region, t=0 for March 1st, 2003, t=1 for March 2nd, 2003 and so on), denoted by N\n1(t),N\n2(t) and I(t) respectively. Suppose that N\n1(t) and N\n2(t) are counting processes with intensity processes or cause\u2010specific instantaneous transition rates for a transition to death and to recovery on the tth day, denoted by \u03b3\n1(t) and \u03b3\n2(t) respectively, that satisfy the multiplicative intensity model\n\nwhere F\nt={I(u),N\ni(u), for i=1,2;0u<t}, the \u03c3\u2010field representing the history of the epidemic process up to but not including time t.

This is particularly true for SARS, when clinicians all over the world had to deal with this highly contagious and frightening pneumonic illness with no idea of its aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, management issues or prognosis, other than anecdotal information from colleagues from mainland China (Tsang and Lam, 2003; Lee et al., 2003). The original estimate of the fatality rate for SARS was only about 4.5%, by both the WHO and the Hong Kong Health Authority (Department of Health of Hong Kong Government, 2003), even as late as the beginning of April 2003. This was later adjusted to about 10% in May 2003. This underestimation of the fatality rate from SARS must have undoubtedly affected the health care planning measures that were taken to contain SARS, and thus the outcome of the SARS outbreak at the community level.",

Besides Beijing, the realtime fatality rates of all other areas seem to fluctuate around 12\u201320%. The constant fatality assumption, which was adopted by Donnelly et al. (2003), does not reflect the situation at the population level. Indeed the approach of Donnelly et al. (2003) can be extended easily to regression models set up to allow for differences in the diagnosis and management of patients by allowing the (time constant) case fatality rate to depend on relevant (possibly time\u2010varying) explanatory variables. However, a time\u2010varying fatality rate at a population level is always helpful and meaningful to medical researchers.",

Any variation in clinical outcome measures, e.g. as a result of improved treatment modalities, would not be depicted by such a definition. By using the actual calendar timescale, rather than duration of hospitalization, the method proposed provides a visual assessment of the effect of other factors, including variation in clinical management and other exogenous (including unidentified) factors over the course of the outbreak. A stable estimate of the fatality rate could reflect a more mature approach to the diagnosis and treatment of SARS, although the efficacy of using high dose corticosteroid and ribavirin, to deal with the lung parenchymal inflammation and coronavirus itself, are largely controversial (Booth et al., 2003; Wenzel and Edmond, 2003; Cyranoski, 2003). The constant case fatality assumption is more suitable for some well\u2010known infectious diseases such as rabies or smallpox because the aetiology, pathogenesis and treatment have been well studied with a standard treatment protocol. It is recommended that the realtime fatality rate be investigated at the outbreak of an emerging epidemic. It can serve as an indicator of the change in the fatality rate over time and can provide information on the effectiveness of the policy and treatment that are adopted.",

In the absence of data from controlled clinical trials for the treatment of SARS, it would be interesting to speculate whether the time\u2010varying fatality rates that are calculated by our model could be related to the different clinical treatment protocols that were used by these areas. For instance, the use of ribavirin was essentially forbidden in Canada by late April 2003, whereas it has consistently been the standard empirical practice in Hong Kong. The use of continuous positive airway pressure, delivered by nasal masks, to patients with hypoxia has been partly attributed as a cause of the low case fatality and low intensive care unit admission in mainland China (personal communication from Professor N. S. Zhong of Guangdong). The use of traditional Chinese medicine has also been claimed to be the cause of low case fatalities in Beijing, and glycyrrhizin, an active component of liquorice roots, has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS\u2010associated coronavirus (Cinatl et al., 2003). The Singaporian practice of using ribavirin and corticosteroid in the treatment of SARS is not uniform, and the standard protocol that is practised in Taiwan has not been fully published (Twu et al., 2003; Hsu et al., 2003). Although these differences in clinical practices could contribute to a difference in case fatalities, it should be cautioned that they do not necessarily equate to conclusions that are drawn from controlled clinical trials. Not withstanding these limitations, especially acknowledging the insensitivity of the case fatality rate as a clinical outcome and the possible discrepancy in the diagnostic stringency, it is possible that ribivarin treatment could have no effects in the clinical outcome of SARS patients.",
