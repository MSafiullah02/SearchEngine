Pol3 is translated as a Gag3-Pol3 fusion protein dependent on a +1 programmed frameshift at a site with the overlap between the two genes. We show that the Ty3 frameshift frequency varies up to 10-fold in S. cerevisiae cells depending on carbon source. Frameshift efficiency is significantly lower in cells growing on glucose as carbon source than in cells growing on poor alternative carbon sources (glycerol/lactate or galactose). Our results indicate that Ty3 programmed ribosomal frameshift efficiency in response to glucose signalling requires two protein kinases: Snf1p and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Increased frameshifting on alternative carbon sources also appears to require cytoplasmic localization of Snf1p, mediated by the Sip2p protein. In addition to the two required protein kinases, our results implicate that Stm1p, a ribosomeassociated protein involved in nutrient sensing, is essential for the carbon sourcedependent regulation of Ty3 frameshifting. These data indicate that Ty3 programmed ribosomal frameshift is not a constitutive process but that it is regulated in response to the glucose-signalling pathway. a Frameshift frequency in the glucose grown wild type yeast strain is 4.4 AE 0.3 %.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) is one of the major control mechanisms of gene expression in various metazoan viruses including retroviruses and also occurs more rarely in cellular genes of eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Jacks and Varmus, 1985; Farabaugh, 1996; Namy et al., 2004; Jacobs et al., 2007) . During translation elongation, ribosomes change reading frame in a +1 or \u00c01 direction relative to the start codon, resulting in the translation of a protein encoded in two reading frames in the mRNA.

Peptides derived from Gag3, after proteolytic cleavage, function as viral nucleocapsid proteins for the formation of Ty3 virus-like particles in the yeast cells.

The protein kinases Snf1p and cAMP-PKA are known to be the major factors regulating diverse metabolic events by carbon sources in S. cerevisiae. Having shown that glucose signalling regulates the PRF frequency in Ty3, we tested whether Snf1p and PKA were involved in the regulation of the Ty3 frameshift frequency. First, we used mutant strains in which PKA or Snf1p is constitutively active. Reg1p is the negative regulator of Snf1p kinase responsible for reduced activity in glucose-grown cells. In a reg1\u0394 mutant, Snf1p activity is constitutively high (Ludin et al., 1998) and we found that Ty3 PRF in a reg1\u0394 mutant was nearly 2-fold higher than in wild-type yeast grown in glucose medium ( Table 3 ). The high-affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase Pde2p is a negative regulator of PKA activity; the increased levels of cytoplasmic cAMP in a pde2\u0394 mutant cause elevated PKA activity (Park et al., 2005) and we found that Ty3 PRF in a pde2\u0394 mutant was nearly 2-fold higher than wild type (Table 3) . By contrast, a pde1\u0394 mutant lacking low-affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase Pde1p has no effect on the cytoplasmic cAMP levels (Park et al., 2005) and we found that Ty3 PRF is unchanged from wild type ( Table 3) . As expected, expression of the control CYC1-lacZ gene fusion was increased relative to wild type more than 3-fold in the reg1\u0394 mutant strain grown in glucose, demonstrating that Snf1p is constitutively active in this mutant yeast strain.

Furthermore, in cells grown in ethanol, which causes sequestration of Snf1p in the vacuole, Ty3 PRF frequency decreased 3-fold. These results suggest that cytoplasmic Snf1 kinase may be necessary for stimulation of PRF in Ty3 in response to alternative carbon sources. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of snf1\u0394 and sip2\u0394 deletions on PRF efficiency. Sip2p, one of the b-subunits of Snf1p, promotes cytoplasmic localization and stimulates the kinase activity of Snf1p (Vincent et al., 2001) . snf1\u0394 and sip2\u0394 mutants are each viable; although sip2\u0394 cells grow in alternative carbon sources, snf1\u0394 cells do not. To test the effect of Snf1p on Ty3 PRF, snf1\u0394 or sip2\u0394 mutant yeast strain was grown in glucose medium to logarithmic stage and then shifted to glycerol-lactate medium for 8 h. In wild-type cells, this nutritional shift resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in PRF (Table 2 ), but in snf1\u0394 or sip2\u0394 mutant cells there was no increase in the frameshift frequency when these strains were grown in glycerol and lactate medium (Table 4 ).

Ethanol-induced localization of the Snf1p kinase to the vacuole, which occurs both in the wild-type strain or a sip2\u0394 strain, should reduce cytoplasmic Snf1 activity and also reduces Ty3 PRF, consistent with our hypothesis (Table 4 ). The results obtained from reg1\u0394, snf1\u0394 and sip2\u0394 mutants strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic Snf1p-Sip2p complex stimulates Ty3 PRF in response to alternative carbon sources ( Table 4) .

Alternatively, it was possible that increased cAMP might regulate Ty3 PRF by a pathway not involving PKA. To test the role of cAMP-dependent PKA in the activation of Ty3 frameshift, we quantified Ty3 PRF in a strain lacking the three PKA structural genes, tpk1\u0394, tpk2\u0394, and tpk3\u0394. Because PKA is essential, the triple deletion mutant is inviable; viability can be restored by deletion of the YAK1 gene, a non-essential gene encoding another kinase involved in the glucose response. This mutant was derived from the S. cerevisiae strain \u03a31278b background, which has an intrinsically high level of cAMP and hence very high levels of PKA activity (Stanhill et al., 1999) . This higher level may explain why the PRF frequency (14%) for the \u03a31278b strain grown in glucose is 3.1-fold higher than in the S288c-based BY4741 series of wild-type yeast strains used in other experiments (Table 5 ).

We believe that the Snf1p kinase directly acts on the translation elongation complex in the cytoplasm. Our results clearly show that stimulation of PRF by Snf1p in alternative carbon sources requires the Sip2 protein. Snf1p is the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins that forms complexes with a single gamma subunit, Snf4p, and three alternative beta subunits, Sip1p, Sip2p and Gal83p. All three Snf1p complexes localize to the cytoplasm during growth on glucose as carbon source. During growth on alternative carbon sources two of the complexes shift to new cellular locations. Gal83p-associated Snf1p shifts to the nucleus in alternative carbon sources and mediates its transcriptional effect (Vincent et al., 2001) . Although overexpression of Sip1p can complement the transcriptional defect of a gal83\u0394 mutant (Mylin et al., 1994) , Sip1p-associated Snf1p is not normally nuclear but instead after a shift to ethanol medium it localizes to the vacuole (Vincent et al., 2001) ; the purpose of this localization is unclear. A significant decrease in the PRF frequency in ethanol-grown yeast cells further supports the involvement of cytoplasmic Snf1p in the regulation of PRF in Ty3. The Snf1p-Sip2p complex remains cytoplasmically localized in all carbon sources. We have demonstrated that, on alternative carbon sources, transcription of CYC1 is derepressed to nearly wild-type levels in \u0394sip2 mutant, indicating that Sip2p-associated Snf1p is not required for the nuclear functions of Snf1p. Hence Sip2 may be essential for the Snf1p-dependent increase in Ty3 PRF, which occurs during cytoplasmic translation. Adding glucose to the yeast cultures growing in non-fermentable carbon sources causes a rapid but transient increase in the cytoplasmic level of cAMP, which activates PKA. It is known that the PKA acts on Snf1p complex and regulates its activities (Hedbacker et al., 2004) . Hence it appears that the Snf1p and PKA control the PRF in an interdependent manner.

Our demonstration that Ty3 PRF is drastically reduced when cells are transferred to ethanol suggests that this effect may be the cause of the decline in Pol3 expression and in Ty3 transposition.
