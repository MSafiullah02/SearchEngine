            "text": "The recent emergence of BTV in livestock in Great Britain (GB) (Landeg 2007) highlights the need to understand the potential effects of climate change on the occurrence, distribution and prevalence of livestock diseases. BTV is an orbivirus that is transmitted by Culicoides midges (Mellor et al. 2000; Mehlhorn et al. 2007; Meiswinkel et al. 2007). Other exotic arboviruses that infect livestock and are probably transmitted by the same midge species as BTV (Mellor et al. 2000) include EHDV, Akabane virus and bovine ephemeral fever virus. Incursions of these viruses have been reported recently in Israel (Yadin et al. 2008) and they could also spread to the European continent as the climate changes. There is already evidence that climate change is affecting endemic diseases in GB too. For example, liver fluke is expanding in range in GB (Scottish Agricultural College 2004; Pritchard et al. 2005) because of warmer, wetter conditions that favour its mud snail intermediate host. National Farmers\u2019 Union (2005) has summarized the key climate concerns for farmers and growers in GB as carbon dioxide levels, temperature (including its effect on growing season), water availability (including relative humidity and soil moisture), cloud cover, wind, weather extremes and sea level rise. Climate change is forecast to affect average annual temperature and precipitation in GB (Hulme et al. 2002) as well as to increase the frequency of extreme weather events including torrential rains, very strong winds, heat waves and droughts. Flooding could increase the prevalence of endemic pathogens that are transmitted by the faecal\u2013oral route, and even that of botulism and anthrax (Baylis and Githeko 2006). Here, the factors through which climate change could affect livestock diseases are reviewed as a basis for developing a qualitative risk assessment framework. A case study is presented for liver fluke and the implications of the effect of climate change on livestock diseases are considered.",

The emergence of disease is a broad term, which covers not only evolution of new microbes, but also expansion in geographic range, increase in incidence, change in pathways or pathology and infection in new host species or populations (Olival and Daszak 2005). Some indication of which animal diseases may emerge in GB with climate change could be gained from considering those livestock diseases that are emerging or are established in other parts of the world (e.g. southern France or Spain) that have a climate similar to that forecast for GB in the future.",

Equine piroplasmosis, which is a tick\u2010borne disease of horses caused by two intraerythrocytic protozoans (Theileria equi and Babesia caballi), provides another example of a disease that occurs near GB. A survey of 424 horses in southern France showed seroprevalence of 64\u00b74% for T. equi and 19\u00b77% for B. caballi (Leblond et al. 2005).",

            "text": "However, a difficulty with this approach is that not all factors will change at the same rate as climate changes. As the average temperatures increase across GB, some factors may change faster than others in effect, resulting in mistiming. An example of mistiming because of climate change is the loss of synchrony between nesting and peak food abundance in migratory birds (Both et al. 2006). Differential movements of wildlife species\u2019 traits (e.g. the range and abundance of species, timing of migration and morphology) in response to the rapid rate of temperature rise together with habitat destructions could result in a disruption of the connectedness among many species in current ecosystems, leading to a reformulation of wildlife species communities (Root et al. 2003). Differential rates of change could create novel, or at least different, microenvironments and ecological and agricultural combinations with certain imbalances and provide new opportunities for livestock diseases to emerge in GB compared to in southern Europe at present. Therefore, forecasting which livestock diseases will emerge in GB as a result of climate change is not as simple as looking at current livestock diseases in southern Europe alone. The arrival of exotic diseases in GB from distant parts of the world is not new (Gould et al. 2006). To forecast the \u2018unexpected\u2019, all potential routes for disease to enter GB need to be considered in risk assessments. Similarly, the introduction, establishment and rapid spread of WNV in the Americas (Diaz et al. 2008) show that there is a risk of livestock diseases from distant parts of the world emerging in Europe. With modern international travel and globalized trade, any risk assessment has to look beyond those diseases currently in Europe. For example, exotic pathogens such as the VEEV and the rickettsia Ehrlichia ruminantium need further consideration.",

            "text": "The ability of a microbial pathogen to mutate and hence respond to opportunities arising from change is a key factor in considering the potential impact of climate change. For example, genetic studies (Brault et al. 2004) of VEEV in Mexico implicated a single amino acid substitution in the envelope glycoprotein in the adaptation of the virus to an efficient epizootic vector, namely the mosquito Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus. This vector became the most abundant species of mosquito feeding on mammals after deforestation eliminated the habitats of Culex taeniopus, which had been the principal mosquito vector. This example illustrates the ability of RNA viruses to respond rapidly to changes in vector populations such as those that could arise as a result of climate change. Another example is a single mutation in CHIKV that promotes infection in the mosquito Aedes albopictus over the recognized vector, Ae. aegypti (Tsetsarkin et al. 2007). This mutation increases the potential for CHIKV to extend its range into Europe and the Americas, where Ae. albopictus has established over the past 20 years (Medlock et al. 2006). In 2007, transmission of CHIKV was reported for the first time outside the tropics with the occurrence of cases in southern Europe (Enserink 2007).",

The degree of conservation of the host receptor used by the pathogen is also important, and although not directly affected by climate change would reduce the species barrier, and hence facilitate spillover into new species such as livestock through encroachment into wildlife habitats, for example.",

            "text": "There are several examples of recent changes in vector range that are related to changes in climatic variables, and that are accompanied by disease. The incursions of BTV into southern Europe reflect the northwards expansion of the traditional vector, Culicoides imicola (Purse et al. 2005), which has also supported excursions of AHSV from endemic areas (sub\u2010Saharan Africa) into Portugal and Spain (Mellor and Hamblin 2004). Argasid (soft) ticks survive well in very dry, desert conditions and Ornithodoros sonrai has expanded its range, and that of tick\u2010borne borreliosis, into areas of sub\u2010Saharan Africa as the 750\u2010mm isohyet (Trape et al. 1996) has moved in association with the drought. O. sonrai serves as the primary vector for ASFV in Senegal (Vial et al. 2007) and its expansion in range could be accompanied by persistence of ASF. The soft tick O. savignyi, which transmits AHFV, is well\u2010established through countries in the Persian Gulf region (Charrel et al. 2007). AHFV was discovered in 1995 and there is little information on its geographic distribution in relation to the wide range of O. savignyi, which could potentially expand with climate change. Argasid ticks have a higher critical temperature (which controls water permeability) than ixodid (hard) ticks and thus have a greater ability to resist desiccation (Davis 1974), which may facilitate their expansion in range with climate change. Although it is unlikely that those Ornithodoros ticks which serve as vectors for ASF and AHF could establish in GB through climate change, other Argasid ticks are present on bats (Argas vespertilionis) and pigeons (Argas reflexus) in GB although only one species of Ornithodoros tick occurs in north west Europe. This is O. maritimus, which is found on seabirds around GB (Martyn 1988).",

It requires microclimates provided by vegetation cover with at least 80% humidity for survival, in addition to an abundance of hosts, including small and large mammals (Pietzsch et al. 2005). Its distribution from historical records has been mapped in GB (Pietzsch et al. 2005). The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, is the vector for Eh. canis and Babesia canis in dogs and also for human rickettsioses including Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii) and Boutonneuse fever (Ri. conorii). Dogs transported from the south of France, Spain and Italy have introduced this tick into northern Europe (Hillyard 1996). Infestations of this hard tick have been reported within and outside GB quarantine kennels (Bates 2008), with a case of its establishing in a well\u2010heated house in London reported more than 20 years ago (Fox and Sykes 1985). Rhipicephalus species require temperatures above 18\u00b0C to complete their life cycle and milder winters could facilitate their establishment in GB. Climate\u2010related change was attributed as the major factor in the marked shift in the distribution of I. ricinus to higher altitudes (by up to 500 m) in the Krkonose National Park in the Czech Republic, where two human cases of TBE have occurred at altitudes higher than any previously reported (Daniel et al. 2004; Danielova et al. 2006).",

They noted that tick distribution and abundance are more likely to be affected by factors other than climate such as host abundance, host resistance to ticks, acaricide use and grazing management.

For example, BTV is transmitted most efficiently by C. imicola at temperatures of 28\u201330\u00b0C, much less efficiently at lower temperatures, and not at all below 10\u00b0C (Gloster et al. 2007). Midges of the C. obsoletus complex (Mehlhorn et al. 2007), which are indigenous to the north Palaearctic, have served as vectors for BTV8 outbreaks in north\u2010western Europe since 2006. The higher temperatures recently experienced in northern Europe have increased the competence of the indigenous species of midge which, for the first time, have served as vectors for BTV. Similarly, the competence of Culicoides midges for transmitting AHSV increases with temperature (Mellor and Hamblin 2004). In contrast, infection of Western equine encephalitis virus in the mosquito vector, Cu. tarsalis, is suppressed at higher temperatures (Reeves et al. 1994). For many arboviruses, the extrinsic incubation period, which is the time between when an uninfected vector feeds on a viraemic host and is able to infect a susceptible host, is shorter at higher temperatures. This reflects a higher rate of virogenesis, which compensates for the shorter lifespan of the vector at higher temperatures.",

The main effect of climate change on mean temperature is through warmer night\u2010time temperatures (Beniston and Diaz 2004). This is important for many insect vectors that fly and feed at night. In the heat wave of summer 2003, night\u2010time temperatures did not cool off to any great extent in Switzerland (Beniston and Diaz 2004), compounding the effects of heat stress on both humans and livestock. The very high minimum temperatures distinguished the 2003 heat wave from those that occurred in 1947 and 1976. In this respect, the 2003 event was a \u2018climatic surprise\u2019 and Beniston and Diaz (2004) forecast that similar events are likely to occur with increasing frequency in the latter part of the 21st century.

Of particular importance is the impact of climate change on tick\u2010to\u2010tick (nonviraemic) transmission of flaviviruses (e.g. LIV) in the TBEV group (Randolph et al. 2000; Rogers and Randolph 2006).

Climate change could affect the nature and intensity of livestock farming in GB through drought, climate variability (which could reduce grass supply and hence increase reliance on supplementary feed), the requirement for shade and housing to protect against heat stress, new types of animal feed supplement, industry competition and response to extreme weather events such as heat waves and flooding. It is unlikely to become hot enough in GB to require dairy cattle always to be housed during the day in summer and only to graze at night (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2000). For the purpose of risk assessment, the main considerations are the effect of climate change on the intensity of farming and the movement of livestock. More intensive farming, requiring housing to meet food and water shortages and to provide protection from heat stress, could increase the frequency and duration of direct animal\u2010to\u2010animal contacts and hence increase the risk of transmission of diseases. An increase in extensive farming, for example because of a longer grass\u2010growing season (National Farmers\u2019 Union 2005), may reduce the frequency of such contacts, but may increase the opportunities for contact between livestock and wildlife. Flooding is likely to confine livestock to smaller areas, and may promote mixing of breeds and species (e.g. mixing sheep and cattle grazing pastures). Increased transport and movement of livestock within GB to areas with better grasslands or to avoid drought and flooding may also increase between\u2010farm livestock contacts and the risk of exposure of susceptible animals and herds to infection and infestation (Baylis and Githeko 2006).",

It is possible that GB livestock farmers will introduce breeds of livestock better able to withstand different climatic conditions. Some breeds of sheep are much more susceptible to certain livestock diseases e.g. BTV (Darpel et al. 2007) and MVV (Berriatua et al. 2003) than are others and their introduction by GB farmers would alter the susceptibility of GB herds to disease.",

In the southwestern US, the abundance of the deer mouse, a reservoir for Sin Nombre hantavirus, has increased with increased rainfall during recent years (Kruse et al. 2004). Root et al. (2007) reported a doubling of badger numbers in Wytham Woods (Oxfordshire, UK) between 1987 and 2001 and an increase in numbers in southern Finland. They suggested that this may be because of the increase in the availability of earthworms as a result of milder, damper microclimatic conditions and the absence of winter frosts, enabling badgers to feed throughout the winter. In GB, there is some evidence that the common rat increased in abundance between 1996 and 2002, although large annual population fluctuations may obscure trends (Battersby 2005). Similarly, roe deer and muntjac are increasing in abundance in GB (Battersby 2005). This may be related to climate change (for example milder winters), although other factors such as the creation of more deer\u2010friendly habitats through recent changes in land use are also important.

Changes in farming practice and land use because of climate change may occur concurrently with anthropogenic changes such as deforestation, economic change and social change, including the demand for more free\u2010range and \u2018organic\u2019 produce. During periods of drought, the risk of escalation of a low level conflict increases (Giles 2007). Military action although not likely in GB, could increase the prevalence and distribution of livestock diseases in other parts of the world, which in turn would increase the risk of release into GB. Farming of exotic livestock species such as camelids, alpacas and ostriches may increase in GB, and these species may serve as reservoirs or vector hosts for certain livestock diseases. Changes in farming practice in response to climate change, together with the effect of climate change on habitats, will affect the distribution and abundance of wildlife and these changes will affect both the vector species that can be supported and the availability of reservoir hosts of livestock pathogens. Contact between humans, livestock and wildlife may increase, thus creating opportunities for the emergence of new livestock diseases. Local anthropogenic changes may also have an important effect on the vectors. For example, in the Camargue region of France, the abundance of Cu. modestus, which is the main mosquito vector for WNV, has been affected by expansion of rice cultivation, pesticide use and pest\u2010management strategies (Poncon et al. 2007). Change in crop type and hence pesticide use because of adaptation to climate change could affect vectors and host reservoirs, as indeed could growth of small copses to provide a local supply of wood for fuel. Extreme weather events such as flooding in GB can prevent distribution of treated water to households, thus increasing the tendency to store water in containers, which if left stagnant, could provide breeding sites for mosquitoes.",

However, the study recommended the investigation of other factors such as the abundance of tick hosts, human behaviour in relation to exposure to ticks and public health services (e.g. regional differences in vaccination rate) to fully explain the spatial variation observed.

Elfadil et al. (2006) studied the environmental and animal risk factors associated with RVF in south\u2010west Saudi Arabia. Positive associations were found between RVF and the following factors: a dense mosquito population, high rainfall and the presence of lakes and/or ponds. Linthicum et al.

The objective of the work here was more to screen for the emergence of the unexpected in GB against a background of change. The scenarios could be complicated.

An example for the unexpected is the sudden introduction and rapid spread of WNV in the Americas. Although the timing of such an event may be difficult to forecast, importation of an exotic infected bird or indeed an infected mosquito via an airport has been identified as a risk factor for WNV (see Rogers and Sanderson 2006). Other factors such as the existence of both an immunologically na\u00efve bird population (Buckley et al. 2003) and a high density of competent mosquitoes are also important (Glaser 2004).

For module 5, more mixing of cattle and sheep through changes in land use and farming intensity with climate change, or in response to flooding, may increase the exposure of cattle to liver fluke.

Pneumonia caused by lungworm infection and scours caused by gastrointestinal parasites increased in cattle in the south\u2010west of GB in 2007 as a result of the very wet summer, which suited the development and spread of helminth larvae on pasture (Scottish Agricultural College Veterinary Services 2007b). Listeriosis is associated with consumption of soil, although there is no evidence of any increase in either encephalitic or reproductive listeriosis over the past 10 years. B. licheniformis is a soil\u2010borne organism that can cause abortion through build\u2010up in silage and there has been a progressive increase in this type of abortion over the past 10 years.",

            "text": "The approach here assesses the effect of climate change on livestock diseases by identifying the main factors through which changing climatic conditions affect the biology, transmission and epidemiology of the pathogens and vectors. Dufour et al. (2006) addressed issues such as the effect of climate change on the vector, host reservoir, characteristics and epidemiology of the pathogen to evaluate the risk of emergence and development of infectious diseases in France as a result of global warming. They concluded that the probability of the evolution of the epidemiological situation of disease in France was negligible to low for RVFV, low to moderate for AHSV and high for WNV and BTV. These biological approaches can be coupled with methods for eliciting expert opinion that ask experts separately, through questionnaires or workshops, to assess the risks of release and exposure and the potential consequences for GB according to the World Organisation for Animal Health framework for risk assessment (Office International des Epizooties 2004). Such an approach has recently been applied to assess the risks of incursion of five vector\u2010borne epizootic viruses into Europe from other parts of the world (P. Gale, unpublished data). Experts can also be asked to assess risks not only for a top\u2010level \u2018all routes\u2019 overview but also for specific routes for example, vectors, meat products, wildlife, livestock, persons and companion animals. Comparing results from the two approaches provides complementary information and a powerful tool to address the question of the effect of climate change on livestock diseases.",
