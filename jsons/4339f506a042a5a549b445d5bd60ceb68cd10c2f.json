However, it has recently been suggested that they may cause more severe respiratory disease. Immunofluorescence (IF) assays are rapid and inexpensive and are often used for the detection of respiratory viruses. Objectives: We sought to develop an IF procedure, using commercially available reagents, for the detection of respiratory picornaviruses directly from nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Study design: From 1st November 2006 until 31st October 2007 all NPA from patients with respiratory infection were stained with the Light Diagnostic Pan-Enterovirus Reagent -\"Blend\" by IF (IF-ENVPAN). Those specimens which tested positive with this stain were further tested (subject to the availability of frozen specimen) with the xTAG respiratory viral panel, a multiplex PCR directed against respiratory picornaviruses, adenovirus (ADV), respiratory sincytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (IFA and IFB), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-4, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and coronaviruses. Results: 241/1122 NPA tested positive by IF-ENVPAN. 143 NPA were available for testing by xTAG respiratory viral panel.

Testing with enterovirus and rhinovirus specific PCR or sequencing-studies are necessary to resolve this uncertainty. However, it is probable that both rhinoviruses and enteroviruses are part of a continuous spectrum of related viruses causing related diseases. 23 Of a total of 1122 tested NPA 241 were positive by IF-ENVPAN for respiratory picornaviruses. When using IF, respiratory picornaviruses were the second most frequently detected viral pathogens in NPA; the first if only subjects older than 1 year are considered. Our IF data supports the suspected high frequency of respiratory picornaviruses as viral pathogens as described by other authors. [3] [4] [5] 7, 8 xTAG multiplex PCR detected at least one viral pathogen (41 respiratory picornaviruses) in 56 of the 100 IF negative NPA and was thus, when compared to IF, more sensitive for the detection of respiratory viruses, particularly for respiratory picornaviruses. Given the wide genetic variation of respiratory picornaviruses, it is possible that the monoclonal antibody blend does not react with all serotypes present. On the other hand, the enhanced sensitivity of molecular methods compared to IF for the detection of respiratory viruses 20, 24, 25 should not only be regarded as being advantageous. Respiratory picornaviruses have also been detected by PCR in approximately 20% of subjects lacking respiratory symptoms. [26] [27] [28] [29] Moreover, at least two reports have documented the recovery of respiratory picornaviruses by PCR for 2-3 week following acute respiratory illness. 28, 29 Does the detection of respiratory picornaviruses nucleic acid represent the presence of virus without correlation with the current clinical symptoms, the persistence of virus genome following previous infection or an active infection? 7,28,30 A major advantage of IF methods is, paradoxically, their relative insensitivity-there has to be a substantial quantity of virus material present to score as positive. 30 An IF positive result correlates well with an active infection. 16 Furthermore, IF is much more flexible and much less expensive than molecular procedures: the results are available several time a day within 2-4 h and the preparation of new specimens can begin while earlier ones are being completed. 16, 31 For all these reasons IF still retains advantages over PCR as a first-line test to guide clinicians. 31 Summing up, our data support the clinical utility of IF-ENVPAN staining of NPA for the detection of respiratory picornaviruses, particularly in infants and children. The addition of IF-ENVPAN to IF screening, targeting ADV, RSV, PIV, IFA, IFB and HMPV, will provide a more complete diagnosis of respiratory viral infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end":
