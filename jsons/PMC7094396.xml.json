However, only a tiny fraction of all H. pylori-infected individuals eventually develop GC [2]. The majority of infected cases remain asymptomatic through life. It is now understood that the chronic inflammatory response initiated by H. pylori critically contributes to GC pathogenesis [3]. Typically starting from the antral region that incites an inflammatory response, this H. pylori-mediated inflammation can gradually spread to the upper stomach over time and cause increasingly severe mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and malignant transformation at the gastric lining [4,5].",

H. pylori could directly elevate the expression of spermine oxidase in gastric epithelial cells and macrophages, and induce DNA damage through the production of reactive oxygen species [6,7]. H. pylori and high salt diet also synergistically increase the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL1, IL6, and TNF, which possess angiogenic and pro-metastatic roles in tumor [8,9]. Adaptive immune responses involving B cells and T cells likely also contributed to GC initiation. Mice infected with Helicobacter spp. showed symptoms of human GC patients, but not when B cells and T cells were absent [10,11]. Further evidence demonstrated that Th1-mediated IFNg responses contributed to the gastric atrophy in mice infected with Helicobacter spp. [12,13].",

IL10 is shown to suppress innate and adaptive immune responses, mediate tissue repair, and maintain epithelium integrity [17]. In addition, IL10 can directly dampen the signal transduction of CD8 T cells, thus increasing the threshold required for antigen recognition and activation [18]. Interestingly, polymorphisms that increase IL10 production are associated with elevated GC risk [[19], [20], [21]], which is contrary to the hypothesis that IL10 may prevent inflammation-induced disruption of the epithelium. Also, there is evidence that IL10 can promote the activation and expansion of tumor-resident CD8 T cells in murine tumor studies [22,23], which is in contrast with the common notion that IL10 inhibited CD8 T cell responses.",

In GC patients, IL10 expression level is positively associated with the density of microvessels and negatively associated with CD8 T cell infiltration in the tumor [26]. However, the appearance of IL10 is often accompanied by inhibitory immune cells, such as regulatory B cells, regulatory dendritic cells, M2-polarized macrophages, and tumor-associated macrophages [[27], [28], [29]]. Hence, some of the IL10-mediated suppressive effects, previously described in other studies, might have required the coexistence of other inhibitory molecules and cell types. Indeed, IL10 in IL10 receptor (IL10R)-expressing CD8 T cells has been shown to strongly induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1 and promote the in situ proliferation of tumor-resident CD8 T cells [22,23]. In addition, in a coronavirus-infected murine encephalitis model, CD8 T cells that produced IL10 displayed higher cytokine and chemokine expression and stronger cytolytic activity [30].",

In both healthy controls and GC patients, CD8 T cells that expressed IL10 could be observed following anti-CD3/CD28 and IL2 stimulation. Interestingly, IL10-single positive cells were rare, and the majority of IL10-expressing cells also presented concurrent IFNg expression. GC patients had more IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cells than healthy controls, while healthy controls had more IFNg-single positive CD8 T cells than GC patients, which seemed to suggest that the IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cell population arose due to disease. We later found that prolonged stimulation alone could result in higher levels of IFNg/IL10-double positive cells and lower levels of IFNg-single positive cells. Hence, it is possible that CD8 T cells in GC patients are continuously being challenged with tumor antigens and/or H. pylori antigens, resulting in prolonged activation and higher frequencies of IFNg/IL10-double positive cells. In the future, the antigen specificity of IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cells should be investigated.",

We found that certain features of the IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cell subset, including lower PD1, lower TIM3, and higher KLRG1, resembled Tfc cells [25]. Indeed, we found that the IFNg/IL10-double positive cells were highly enriched in CD45RO+CXCR5+ CD8 T cells, while IFNg-single positive cells were enriched in CD45RO+CXCR5- CD8 T cells. This feature would help us demonstrate the role of IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cells in animal models using deletions and adoptive transfers. In past research, Tfc cells were shown to present stronger proliferation in response to PD1 blockade in exhausted CD8 T cells [31], suggesting that they might be candidates of antitumor immunotherapy. However, regulatory functions also have been demonstrated in IL10-expressing CD8 T cells. For example, IL4 and IL12-induced IL10-expressing CD8 T cells was shown to inhibit graft-versus-host disease in vivo, and suppressed naive and effector T cell activation and IgG/IgE production [32]. Interestingly, CD8 T cell-mediated IL10 was shown to resolve chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain [33]. Hence, IL10 expression might serve multiple roles in CD8 T cells, and the function of IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cells should be further investigated using animal models.",
