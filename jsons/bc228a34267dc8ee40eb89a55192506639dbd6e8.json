The notion of catharsis is closely related to \"purification\" or \"purgation\". In 2008 it was the \"global economic pandemic\" that infected world economy and society in general. Bailout rescue funds were widely distributed by the European Commission, the Central European Bank, and the IMF to EU-Member states, and the main question arising refers to the extent to which these funds induced a \"purification\" of the chronic problems of the Greek health system. The main purpose of this editorial is to review the plethora of measures implemented in Greece during the economic crisis, to assess their degree of success in leading to the much awaited 'catharsis'.",

Given the commitment of the European health model [1] to the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and universality in the access to health services, several reforms have been introduced aiming at improving health outcomes in a cost-effective way in the European setting. The recent economic crisis introduced a new impetus in the balancing of economic and social objectives within the health systems. The decline in GDP and the corresponding reduction in health expenditures have jeopardized the ability of the European governments to meet the obligations stemming from the European values of equity, efficiency, and effectiveness [1] . The Commission called the member countries to revisit their strategies and adapt to the changing macro-economic environment by introducing more resilient policies.",

Despite the often-stated argument that austerity measures are associated strictly to funding curtailment, there is a greater scope of policies, as it has been reported by the ECFIN [3] : \"Since the 2008-2009 crisis the focus of reforms has been on generating savings and improving the financing side, with few reforms aiming at improving the value for money of public health care\".",

Based on this, assessing health inequalities in Greece and how they have changed as a result of the economic crisis is among the primary objectives of this editorial.

The first bankruptcy took place in the year 1827, four years after the Greek revolution against the Ottoman State. Similar economic events leading to bankruptcy were recorded in 1832, 1843, 1893, and during the great crisis of 1932. Upon examination, the economic crisis of 1929 compared to the crisis of 2009 shows crucial differences with respect to both its depth and duration as well as on the range of its impact on health systems, the society and citizens' overall health. (whereas the corresponding EU-27 average was at around 2% at that time), went into recession in 2009. The economic downturn had a series of adverse effects on the wider economy and the health sector as a corollary. More specifically [5] , over the 2008-2015 period, GDP was reduced by 29.5%, wages were reduced by 35-45%, private consumption dropped by 30% and health expenditure declined by 41%. At the same time, income inequality (S80/S20) increased by 11% and the unemployment rate reached 27.1% (an increase of 276.4%). The share of population at risk of poverty increased from 27.6% in 2009 to 36% in 2014. Finally, life expectancy stabilized at about 80 years.",

Even before the crisis, the Greek healthcare system was suffering from a series of inefficiencies relating to structural problems in the public administration, financial pressures and the failure to contain health expenditure growth. In the pre-crisis period (1980-2009), the system faced serious economic problems due to tax evasion, corruption, waste of public money, considerable inefficiencies in the operation of public hospitals, lack of transparency, absence of cost containment measures and an ineffective and inefficient primary health care system. Until 2009, the National Health System of Greece was notorious for not using any monitoring tools to collect and analyze information on its performance. The distribution of health resources in the regions was mainly based on historical and political criteria, such as fragmented reforms, which were the result of political pressure and client-based relations. Consequently, the NHS was characterized by uneven, unequal and inadequate distribution of health and financial resources. In addition, there was a mismatch between the existing public funding allocation for health and citizens' expectations, which stem from the limited participation of citizens in health policy-making and prioritization.",

A DEA analysis has indicated that only 23.2% of the hospitals were fully efficient, 37.5% were only efficient, while 39.3% were inefficient [6] . These results could be attributed to several chronic issues regarding medical procedures in Greece, such as the inadequate medical guidelines, the absence of medical protocols and medical records, the fragmentation of services combined with poor coordination between them, and the insufficient supervision by regional or national authorities. Many healthcare units were subject to understaffing, low number of nurses compared to doctors, unbalanced distribution of specialized doctors, lack of GPs and an absent referral system. Moreover, there has been no successful initiative promoting prevention for several years. Inefficiencies are also observed in primary healthcare. Several studies have measured the efficiency of rural health centers across Greece. Results indicate that the mean technical efficiency level was under 60% [7] .",

According to OECD data, pharmaceutical expenditure accounts for 1.5% of GDP on average across the OECD countries [7] . Greece was classified among the highest spenders with 2.5% of GDP devoted to pharmaceutical care [7] . Examination of the evolution of pharmaceutical expenditure in the pre-crisis period of 2000-2009 among the OECD countries, shows that Greece has the highest annual rate of growth (1.1% per annum).

Calculating the incremental cost effectiveness ratios (i.e., marginal increase in health expenditure divided by marginal increase in life expectancy) we find Greece to be the most cost-ineffective country, as it is associated with the highest Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio ( ICER Greece = 1.18 ). At the same time, the rest of its Southern European neighbors record much lower ratios ( ICER Portugal = 0.74, ICER Spain = 0.68, ICER Italy = 0.62 ) .

A mandatory all-day functioning of public hospitals was enacted, with the afternoon outpatient surgeries of public hospitals providing medical services to patients, on a consultation fee ranging between 30 and 90 euros. In addition, a centralized procurement of health supplies and a mandatory e-prescription by active substance were introduced.

However, the economic crisis brought a halt to this declining trend. For the first time in Greek history, infant mortality increased during the crisis by 65% [15] . In 2008 as much as 2.6 infant deaths per thousand live births were recorded. In 2017 this rate increased to 4.3 infant deaths. It is often argued that infant mortality depends on education, income, and other socio-economic variables. It is considered as a representative indicator of the general socio-economic level of a country. The increase in infant mortality in Greece reveals the detrimental effects of the recession and the overall deterioration of the social safety net.",

The mean scores of HRQoL indicated a significant reduction by 10% in the case of EQ-VAS and by 22% in the EQ-5D Index. Specifically, the value of EQ-VAS before the crisis was EQ-VAS Before = 86.06 and the reported value during the crisis was EQ-VAS During = 76.72. The reduction in EQ-5D index was larger, revealing more accentuated effects of the crisis on HRQoL compared with the EQ-VAS. The EQ-5D Index before the crisis was EQ-5D Index Before = 0.83 and during the crisis EQ-5D Index During = 0.65. Hence, the EQ-5D index appears to be more sensitive in describing the health impact of the crisis. A significant reduction in HRQoL was also associated with a gradient among the rich and the poor revealing a polarization and greater inequalities among the income classes. The repercussions of the crisis were much more apparent in the poor population and less so in the rich. The change in mean EQ-VAS before and after the crisis was much larger in the poor class in comparison with the richer one. Indicatively, the change in the mean value among the poor was 14.9 (EQ-VAS Before = 82.2-EQ-VAS During = 67.9), while the corresponding change for the rich was 4.9 (EQ-VAS Before = 88.7-EQ-VAS During = 83.8).

EU policy objectives focus on certain values rooted in the long history of European nations. However, while it is easier to agree on some shared values, it is much harder to implement these. The Greek case study, with its positive and negative aspects of health reforms can be a useful example of the wide range of austerity policies implemented and the augmented social benefits and risks. The Coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and has become one of the biggest threats to the global economy. We do not know how long it will last and what is its impact on inequality, unemployment, and the economic growth. The OECD [17] , in its March 2020 report downgrades economic forecast for all economies across the world. The governor of the Bank of Greece forecasts zero economic growth, while the Morgan Stanley projects a 5.3 recession in Greece [18] . Despite of its negative effects on society and economy, the crisis should be viewed as a \"window opportunity\" to rethink the European values and implement the relevant effective policies, if 'catharsis' is to ever be achieved.",
