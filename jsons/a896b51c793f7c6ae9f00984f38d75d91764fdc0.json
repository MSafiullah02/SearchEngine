            "text": "Optimism among health law scholars is rare in the time of coronavirus. Yet this piece suggests that the crisis might be helpful in overruling one controversial health law policy that predates the virus: the FDA\"s blood donation ban for gay and bisexual men. The blood ban was developed in response to the 1980s HIV-AIDS outbreak. Scholars have criticized this policy for years now as being outdated and unconstitutional. A step in the right direction occurred on April 2, 2020, when the FDA issued new recommendations to blood banks changing the one-year deferral for donations from men who have sex with men to a threemonth deferral due to the shortage in the blood supply and after a public outcry on the issue. Yet, the policy is still problematic as it expresses disdain about sex between men. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, states have issued travel restrictions on travelers from severely impacted states. This piece argues that outside of the dwindling blood supply, experience with stigma as a result of the travel restrictions has the potential to change public perceptions about the ban. Both policies, the blood ban and the COVID-19 interstate travel restrictions, are necessary for the short term, are based on activities connected with a disease, and create stigma with respect to the affected populations. Although no one can imagine the travel restrictions continuing after the pandemic is under control, the FDA\"s ban has existed for decades after the end of the AIDS crisis. Drawing parallels between the policies and their stigmatizing effects could help mobilize the public against the blood ban and eventually have it lifted entirely.",

            "text": "On March 12, 2020, during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic before shelter-in-place orders had been enacted, the Red Cross turned to Twitter in an effort to encourage the public to donate blood \"in a time where blood centers throughout the country have experienced a significant drop in donations due to #COVID19.\" 1 \"Don\"t let #COVID19 stop you. If you're healthy, your blood donation is needed. Donating blood is safe and people should not hesitate to give,\" the tweet thread declared. 2 The Red Cross's original tweet went viral: it was \"liked\" more than 6,900 times and shared more than 2,800 times. 3 Some people who shared the tweet, however, had a point they wished to get across to the Red Cross and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the regulator in charge of the blood donation policies. Kevin Maisto, for example, shared the PSA for donation with his own caption: \"As a healthy gay man, I cannot help. Sorry!\" 4 Maisto and others 5 were referring to a nearly four-decades-old public health policy known as the gay blood ban. The second half of the 1980s was an era in which a connection between the HIV-AIDS, gay sex, and blood transfusions was first discovered. This was also a time that HIV testing and blood detection tools were nascent and underdeveloped. Therefore, as a necessary measure to prevent the spread of the virus, in 1985, the FDA recommended that blood banks indefinitely defer blood donations from men who had had sex with men (MSM), even one time, since 1977. 6 Nowadays, however, things are far different with regard to blood testing as well as HIV treatment and detection. Technological advancements in blood monitoring have significantly decreased the chances of contracting HIV through a blood transfusion from 1 in 2,500 prior to Soucek and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions that helped improve this piece. I also wish to thank Heather Rothman for her excellent editing work. Special thanks to Asaf Kletter for helping to clarify my argument. The FDA\"s blood ban was amended in 2015 to recommend the deferral of blood donations from men who had had sex with men in the year prior to the donation. 11 This amendment was the fruit of years of lobbying and advocacy efforts by organizations such as the American Association of Blood Banks, America\"s Blood Centers, the American Red Cross, and the American College of Physicians. 12 Still, many scholars have argued against the modified blood ban, contending that it is discriminatory, unnecessarily stigmatizing, and unconstitutional. 13 Critics have also noted that evidence-based research points to lifting the ban altogether, 14 an action already undertaken by several countries worldwide. 15 11 The FDA also recommends to \"defer for 12 months from the most recent contact a female who has had sex during the past 12 months with a man who has had sex with another man in the past 12 months.

At the end of that period, the donor returns to give blood again, and if also negative, the frozen units are approved for transfusion. Under such conditions, blood safety is ensured, as donors are checked at two points in time. 16 Italy, which eliminated MSM deferrals in 2001, takes a different approach, one of \"individual risk assessment\" of \"risky behaviors.\" It assesses each potential donor\"s risk with an extensive questionnaire whereby \"sexual orientation is not a disqualifier; instead, sexual orientation is one component of individualized risk assessment.\" 17 Research concluded that this policy did not affect either the incidence or prevalence of HIV infection among blood donors (whether MSM or not). 18 Public outcries for lifting the blood ban due to the scarce blood supply during the COVID-19 crisis did not begin and end on social media. On March 26, 2020, a group of fifteen US Democratic representatives sent a letter to the FDA urging the agency to \"shift away from antiquated and stigmatizing donation policies\" and address a need for blood donations. 19 Tapping into the connection between ameliorating the blood shortage and removing the ban has been undertaken before. In 2014, for example, it was estimated that lifting the ban altogether would add 360,600 potential male blood donors who would likely donate 615,300 additional pints of blood each year, a 4% increase from yearly blood donations. 20 On April 2, 2020, the FDA issued new recommendations to blood banks changing the current one-year deferral for donations from MSM to a three-month deferral due to the severe shortage in blood supply. 21 The new policy, similar to the one currently in place in the United Kingdom, 22 will allow MSM to donate blood if they have not had sexual contact within the last 15 Soucek, supra note 6, at 1903; I.

On March 12, President Trump said in a press conference that it is a \"possibility\" that the administration could restrict travel within the United States if certain areas get \"too hot,\" i.e., where percentages of coronavirus are higher compared with those of the rest of the country. 36 The Supreme Court acknowledged that although \"the word \"travel\" is not found in the text of the Constitution \u2026 the \"constitutional right to travel from one State to another\" is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence,\" and is considered a fundamental right.

Nonetheless, other groups charged the Center with stigmatizing the gay men population, similar to the arguments made in the blood ban context. See: Pulver, supra note 12, at 127. 33 ",

California discusses the constitutionality of restrictions on the movement of individuals. 39 Following a conviction under the California state law banning persons from transporting \"any indigent person who is not a resident\" to the state, the Supreme Court struck down the statute, as it put an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. 40 The law was put in place to allow states to take \"precautionary measures against the moral pestilence of paupers, vagabonds, and possibly convicts,\" 41 and it thus informs the balance between freedom of movement and economic interests, not with public health interests. 42 Longstanding case law upheld states\" authority to enact laws meant to protect the public against diseases even if those restrictions cause incidental burdens on interstate commerce. 43 In 1986, the Supreme Court concluded that \"as long as a State does not needlessly obstruct interstate trade or attempt to \"place itself in a position of economic isolation,\" it retains broad regulatory authority to protect the health and safety of its citizens\u2026\" 44 Public health law experts see domestic travel bans as constitutionally problematic: \"Authorities\" attempts to confine infected and uninfected individuals together within a cordon sanitaire would be subjected to the highest level of judicial scrutiny.\" 45 One hundred and twenty years ago, for example, the Northern District Court of California banned a quarantine in San Francisco during a plague outbreak because it almost exclusively targeted residents of Chinese descent. 46 Presidential action restricting domestic travel would be even more problematic from a federalism standpoint, 47 by which under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution the states are entrusted with the police powers to protect the welfare, safety, and health of the public. 48 Against this background, President Trump\"s statement about potentially restricting interstate travel seems unlikely to occur by the federal government. Nevertheless, at the time of this writing, governors in 21 jurisdictions had sought to reduce the number of out-of-state travelers by requiring arriving visitors to self-quarantine for fourteen days through executive orders. 49 In 50 the quarantine only applied to those arriving to the state from the \"too hot areas\" of New York and New Jersey. 51 Texas added to the list 14-day quarantine mandates to travelers coming from Connecticut or the City of New Orleans. 52 Maine and Vermont ordered residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from traveling to their states altogether. 53 Those create \"de facto travel bans for short-term visitors.\" 54 Connecting the Dots: Stigmatizing Effects of the Blood Ban and the COVID-19 Travel Restrictions",

Some may argue that state residency is not clearly associated with an identity (with a few exceptions such as the \"Texan cultural identity\" 58 ). Nevertheless, I suggest that animosity against non-residents from states highly infected by COVID-19 would likely exist due to the expressive value of the policy restrictions. 59 And here is my claim. Suddenly, residents of states once thought of as thriving will be considered \"less than,\" contaminated, and a likely public health hazard. Many Americans will experience firsthand the stigmatizing effects of the travel restrictions that generalize and stigmatize entire populations. For example, New York and New Jersey have been known as the most impacted states. As a reaction, Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo initially announced that police had begun stopping cars with New York plates and that the National Guard would help them conduct house-to-house searches to find people who had traveled from New York and demand that they self-quarantine for 14 days. The policy was changed to resemble a 14-day quarantine similar to that of other states after criticism from the ACLU. 60 A Washington Post piece, published on April 3, 2020, brought to light stories about New York residents being turned away from other states with quotes such as \"Many people consider New Yorkers lepers,\" \"These Cruise ship passengers desperately plead with Florida to allow them in, NBC NEWS (April 1, 2020), https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cruise-ship-passengers-desperately-plead-florida-allow-them-n1173576?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma.",

This process of reflection helps elicit empathic responses for somebody in similar situations. 63 The idea is simple yet has been empirically proven: a person who has experienced something, or even knew someone who belongs to a marginalized or stigmatized group, 64 and has been aware of the experience, tends to be more empathetic toward the experiences of \"the other\" going through parallel incidents. Even the Red Cross in its PSA uses the notion of contact with someone who has benefited from a blood donation to encourage the public to give blood. 65 Experiences of those who have personally been affected and stigmatized by policies enacted in response to the coronavirus pandemic could be leveraged to move the needle on the The key is to effectively communicate to the public and to policy makers the parallels between the two policies. FDA policies have historically been amended through public campaigns, advocacy, and lobbying efforts. 66 This is a rare moment in history and an opportunity for advocates to act and help get people to mobilize against the blood ban and lift it completely. This opportunity is even clearer in light of the FDA\"s indication that it \"intends to revise and replace\" its guidelines based on comments and experience with the implementation within 60 days following the termination of the public health emergency. 67 Empirical research is needed in order to definitively show that people would associate the stigmatizing effects of interstate travel restrictions with the stigma that stems from the blood ban and will support lifting the FDA\"s restrictions. This paper highlights the non-intuitive connections between two public health policies, the COVID-19 interstate travel restriction and the FDA's blood ban, the first crucial step in order to provide support for overriding the blood restriction. With better articulation that such blanket policy is unnecessary nowadays, there is hope that increased empathy and understanding for lifting the blood ban altogether will follow in the post-COVID-19 era.",
