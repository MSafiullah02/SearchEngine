There are two major categories of ventricular dysfunction that can lead to HF, systolic dysfunction, and the commonly termed diastolic dysfunction. The primary mechanism leading to systolic dysfunction is the impairment of ventricular contractility leading to increased ventricular volumes. The primary mechanism for diastolic dysfunction is the impairment of compliance or the inability to increase ventricular end-diastolic volumes and stroke volume. Current evidence suggests that diastolic dysfunction is the cause of the HF syndrome in at least 50% of the elderly with HF, and that the proportion increases with advancing age. Elderly HF patients, with either systolic or diastolic dysfunction, have high morbidity, frequent hospitalizations, and a high incidence of comorbid conditions including stroke, MI, renal dysfunction, and pulmonary disease. Critically ill elderly patients with HF have a poor prognosis, and their management can be complicated. Predictors of mortality include age, male gender, recent hospitalization, diabetes, left ventricular dilatation, systolic dysfunction, coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency, hyponatremia, reduced peak oxygen consumption, and increased minute ventilation.",

Older patients may present with atypical symptoms of HF, such as fatigue, failure to thrive, somnolence, weakness, and confusion. In both diastolic and systolic dysfunction patients commonly experience symptoms of congestion. On physical examination, a laterally or inferiorly displaced apical impulse with an S3 supports systolic dysfunction rather than diastolic dysfunction. Rales, an elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, edema, and evidence of low cardiac output may be found in either. An ECG, chest radiograph, and echocardiogram are essential diagnostic tests. An abnormal ECG highly correlates with the presence of CV disease, and an enlarged cardiac shadow or pulmonary vascular congestion on chest radiograph supports cardiac dysfunction. Ventricular systolic function, ventricular hypertrophy, valvular dysfunction, chamber size, and some assessment of hemodynamics can be made by echocardiography. The measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide levels may also aid in the identification of ventricular dysfunction and the syndrome of HF.",

Diuretic therapy, hormonal therapy, or other vasodilator therapies are essential approaches for managing congestive symptoms.

Thereafter, the goals of care are (1) identification of the stroke as ischemic or hemorrhagic, (2) initiation of thrombolytic therapy when indicated, and (3) recognition and therapy of medical or neurologic complications. The first goal is most easily achieved by obtaining a noncontract-enhanced CT scan of the brain as quickly as possible when stroke is suspected. Hemorrhage is usually obvious on this scan, although early in the course of ischemic stroke there may be no visible abnormality. Early CT may reveal one of the many mimics of stroke: subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, neoplasm, or hydrocephalus. Contrast enhancement may improve yield if tumor or infection are likely. Recall that comorbid conditions abound in the elderly; cardiac arrhythmias or infarction may provoke or result from a cerebrovascular event, mandating 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and continuous cardiac monitoring in all stroke patients. Questions of the numerous other causes of altered mental status in the geriatric patient must be investigated and settled quickly. Current recommendations for management include initiation of intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) as soon as possible, within 180 min of onset of stroke, in the absence of contraindications. Use of rt-PA appears to improve outcome from stroke at 3 months. There is a relative paucity of data documenting treatment of older patients, however, that while there may be poorer outcome from stroke in the elderly population, there is no increased likelihood of rt-PA-induced severe intracranial hemorrhage.

The condition known as protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and micronutrient deficiency complicate the treatment of several conditions seen in the ICU.

Wound healing is impeded by a poor nutritional state in particular, development of decubitus ulcers is more common in malnourished elderly individuals, and successful management is decidedly more difficult. Patients with PEM are at increased risk for serious complications while in the hospital, with slower recovery, poorer functional status at discharge, and higher rates of mortality after discharge.

Because of the various types of body habitus found in ICU patients, a calculation of the Quetelet body mass index (BMI) is helpful to standardize weight to height, providing a relatively standardized estimate of body fat: BMI  =  weight (kg)/by height (in m2). In the geriatric population, a BMI less than 20 is predictive of nearly 50% 1-year mortality; indeed, it may be a stronger predictor of mortality than is diagnosis. Similar results have been found among critically ill adults with a BMI less than or equal to the 15th percentile. Such data suggests that the optimal BMI may be higher in the elderly than in the general population. Misguided hypocaloric feeding, directed at mobilizing excess fat stores in the obese, but malnourished, elderly patient may worsen the situation by leaving the ongoing catabolic protein breakdown associated with critical illness uncorrected.",

Albumin is a product of hepatic metabolism, synthesized ultimately from ingested or infused nitrogenous precursors in the presence of adequate caloric support. Although it is held that the serum albumin level is reflective of the nutritional state, various factors influencing serum albumin levels make it only vaguely reflective of overall nutritional status. Serum albumin level does decline somewhat with age\u20140.8 g/L per decade for individuals older than 60 years of age\u2014but generally remains within the numerical normal range. Significantly reduced albumin concentration, therefore, should be attributed to disease processes and be aggressively investigated. A substantial decline in serum albumin concentration is accurately predictive of mortality and worse outcome among the elderly. However, the half-life of albumin, 18\u201319 days, limits the applicability in monitoring acute metabolic and synthetic functions, in which rapid change is significant. Alternatives to albumin include prealbumin and retinol-binding protein. The former has a half-time of 2 days and is not affected by age but is elevated with steroid use. The latter has a half-time of 12 h, decreases slightly with age, and is elevated in the setting of acute liver injury. The serum level of renally excreted retinol binding protein is artificially elevated in renal failure, which may falsely suggest nutritional integrity in patients with reduced renal function.",

Although the family member\u2019s \u201cdo everything for Granddad\u201d dictum is familiar, it often represents an unrealistic appraisal of the possible benefit from certain modalities of care that can be done, but possibly should not be done. Although the ICU is designed as a temporary environment that allows support of body functions during recovery, the complicated technology and meticulous attention to detail that characterizes that environment is not the basis for such \u201cmagical\u201d accomplishments as saving the life of a patient who has a lethal condition, despite the expectations and exhortations of some. Nonetheless, death can often skillfully be forestalled with polished and professional ICU care to such a degree that it may occur immediately after a de-escalation of such care, or later while the patient is on the general ward, in a step-down unit or rehabilitation facility, or after returning home (either early or late) to a life with varying similarity to that prior to the original serious medical occurrence. Meaningful discussions with elderly patients and their families, whether prior to complex morbid surgical procedures or as an ICU stay extends past the first few days, must include accurate outcome data, so as to facilitate informed decisions regarding the specifics and suitability of continued care. Studies addressing outcome in the critically ill geriatric population have produced various results that vary with the metric employed, the duration over which the outcome is monitored, and broad intrapopulation patient variability. The latter category highlights differences in age, premorbid physical status, statements of preference regarding aggressiveness of long-term medical care, and patient and family declarations addressing such subjective concepts as posthospitalization quality of life. The term outcome must be specifically defined as to the depth of support required by the post-ICU elder and its correspondence with that autonomous person\u2019s preferences, which, again, may vary widely, based on cultural, religious, national, and other parameters. Although some elders may prefer a less aggressive care regimen designed around end-of-life comfort at the expense of duration of remaining life, others may desire life extension in the face of critical illness by use of complex technology despite a vanishingly small or nonexistent expectation of recovery. Furthermore, the clinician\u2019s perceptions of the patient\u2019s desires may not be accurate, and thus may lead to withdrawal of care or withholding of a modality of treatment in a manner that would not be considered in the care of a younger patient. It is important to remember that while age may be associated with worse outcome from critical illness; numerous investigations have demonstrated that age, in and of itself, is less a factor than is the severity of the specific condition that warrants intensive care or the general medical condition of the patient prior to the institution of intensive care. Quality of life (QOL) in the post-ICU elder is not necessarily inferior to that of younger individuals; indeed, overall QOL has been demonstrated to be similarly good across age groups ranging from middle-aged to very old (above 80 years). While years of living bring elderly patients with the most complex illnesses and comorbid conditions to the door of the hospital and intensive care unit, it is to be remembered that the elderly can recover fully, or almost so, from profoundly serious illness despite numerous worrisome impediments that would discourage all but the most optimistic clinician. Although a substantial percentage of the elderly cannot be brought back to an independent level of functioning, every effort should be expended to achieve accurate diagnosis and expeditious treatment, providing full intensive support to conditions that are correctable and recognition when reasonable limits have been reached. It should be stressed that every effort should be made to honor the patients autonomy and that their wishes should be addressed early and in a timely fashion.",

Absolute contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy are hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial neoplasm, active internal bleeding, or suspected aortic dissection, all of which have a higher incidence in the elderly.Mortality related to CABG can be estimated to be 30% or higher in the elderly with multiple comorbid conditions.Current evidence suggests that diastolic dysfunction is the cause of the heart failure syndrome in at least 50% of the elderly with heart failure, and that the proportion increases with advancing age.In the event of increasing respiratory failure, positive pressure ventilation unloads respiratory muscles and prevents or treats respiratory muscle fatigue.
