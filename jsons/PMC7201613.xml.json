This life stage is important for building human and social capital, resources that can sustain wellbeing in adulthood [1\u20133]. For young people living with HIV (YPLHIV), who because of greater access to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), can expect to reach adulthood, building and sustaining wellbeing as they grow older is crucial. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) there are an estimated 2.8 million YPLHIV aged 15\u201324 years [4]. Many YPLHIV in SSA are at high risk for HIV-related mortality, morbidity [5] and poor quality of life due to the sub-optimal access to treatment and psycho-social services, including exposure to multiple stigmas [6\u20139]. According to the United Nations [10], the number of YPLHIV in Africa is projected to increase by 44% between 2015 and 2030. Models predict that investment in the quality of life among the growing youth population in SSA, particularly via addressing health needs, could increase labour productivity and resultantly accelerate economic growth [11]. If long-run economic growth is to be achieved, then public health policies need to also promote the wellbeing among YPLHIV, a vulnerable and growing population in this region.",

            "text": "In social psychology, wellbeing denotes a sense of thriving in multiple life domains such as family, career and health [12]. Two constructs of wellbeing exist, subjective wellbeing (SWB) which focuses on people\u2019s emotional and cognitive evaluations of their lives [13] and psychological wellbeing (PWB) which emphasise positive functioning, relationships and human potential [14, 15]. The wellbeing of YPLHIV in SSA is likely to be compromised given the impact HIV/AIDS has on key dimensions of wellbeing such as finding meaning, self-acceptance and maintenance of positive caregiver and peer relationships [16]. Importantly, emerging empirical evidence has shown that YPLHIV in this setting are at high risk for depression and anxiety [17\u201319] and suicidal ideation [20]. Negative mental health functioning is one of the strongest predictors of wellbeing [21], and if experienced during adolescence may lead to reduced wellbeing in adulthood [2, 22], and subsequently unfavourable labour-market outcomes such as low earnings [23\u201325]. The risk of lowered wellbeing among YPLHIV is of major concern as econometric evidence has shown that the stocks and intergenerational transfer of human capital to young people in this region has already been eroded by the HIV/AIDS epidemic [26, 27].",

Substantial investment and progress has been made in reducing the HIV epidemic among young people (SDG 3.3) via scale-up of HIV testing and access to treatment [30, 31]. Yet, promoting mental health and wellbeing (SDG 3.4) among young people has received very little attention. There is growing recognition for the need to include quality of life as an HIV/AIDS programme target [32, 33]. Current multi-sectoral HIV programmes are focused on reducing new HIV-infections among adolescent girls and young women via improving access to health and social services, including economic opportunities [34]. However, monitoring and evaluation frameworks of these programmes do not explicitly include wellbeing as an outcome, a recommended measure in the field of economics for measuring social progress [35]. Valuing only narrow health outcomes in health economic analyses may fail to capture the broader impacts of the multi-sectoral initiatives that go beyond health [36, 37]. From a public health financing perspective, understanding the impact of HIV policies on wellbeing could provide a range of ways to direct and strengthen investments for YPLHIV.",

However, several multi-dimensional wellbeing measures developed for young people in the Global North exist in the field of social psychology, these include multi-dimensional SWB scales (i.e. Student Life Satisfaction Scale [41], Personal Wellbeing Index [42]), and PWB measures (Ryff Scale of PWB [43], Mental Health Continuum Short-Form [44]). In the field of HIV/AIDS epidemiology, health-related quality of life measures that encompass some wellbeing dimensions such as emotional and social functioning have been recommended [45] and applied among adolescents living with HIV, these include the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory [46], KIDSCREEN [47], WHO Quality of Life [48].

A better understanding of the correlates and local experiences of wellbeing among YPLHIV in SSA and how these relate to international conceptualisations of wellbeing is required in the selection of culturally sensitive, yet generalisable, measures of wellbeing for SSA. While several studies have explored wellbeing among young people in this sub-region [49, 50], to the best of our knowledge, no study has systematically reviewed the evidence on what constitutes wellbeing among YPLHIV on the continent. The objectives of this mixed-methods review are to identify and critically assess: 1) quantitative evidence on the correlates of wellbeing among YPLHIV; 2) qualitative evidence on the lived experiences of wellbeing among YPLHIV; 3) integrate these two strands of evidence and identify appropriate measures of wellbeing based on key dimensions of wellbeing relevant to YPLHIV.",

We drew on the relationality meaning model as proposed by Wissing [60] as relationships and connections have been shown to be central to formation of wellbeing among young people [61\u201365]. According to the relationality meaning model, relationships, with self (intrapersonal) and others (interpersonal) are at the centre of a meaningful life, and play an important role in the connections between people and context (i.e. social, cultural, ecological, physical, spiritual) [60]. This model has a strong PWB orientation and emphasises three key elements: 1. meaning of life (experienced in the connectedness to something larger than life and the realisation of values); 2. meaning in life (experienced in the belongingness and relatedness to other people); and 3. meaning to life (expressed via actions such as expressions of affection, longing for belongingness, building relationships). This model hypothesises that meaning of life facilitates the construction of meaning in life which in turn directs activities to provide meaning to life [60]. We specifically applied elements of this model to understand the pathways to wellbeing in order to elucidate dimensions that are relevant in capturing the wellbeing among YPLHIV.",

For qualitative studies, we applied a quality assessment tool adapted from the COREQ checklist [83] and key studies [84, 85]. DG and JS selected the following indicators for this tool based on its relevance to qualitative research design 1) rigor \u2014 use of appropriate theoretical frameworks, sufficient data collected; 2) sincerity \u2014 self-reflexivity, transparency about the methods and challenges; 3) credibility \u2014 triangulation of data, inductive nature of derived themes.",

We categorised studies by country income classification and SSA sub-region as the quality of life among YPLHIV may vary depending on the country\u2019s healthcare resources and HIV-epidemic pattern specific to that sub-region. For the qualitative studies, we applied meta-ethnographic analytical methods [86], as implemented by Atkins, Lewin [87]. We specifically used the reciprocal translation analytical approach to develop themes. This approach entailed analysing and synthesising participant views (first-order construct) and authors\u2019 interpretation (second order constructs) to develop third-order constructs. We implemented this approach by comparing first and second order constructs across studies that were homogeneous in terms of design elements (setting, population and period of ART roll-out) and chronologically ordered studies based on publication date [87]. Subsequently, we matched themes across papers ensuring the third order captured similar themes from various studies. We then tabulated translations by highlighting key third order constructs derived and supporting quotes and narratives. Finally, we interpreted the themes across studies to develop a line-of-argument synthesis describing how all themes interacted to shape wellbeing. We evaluated the quality of the qualitative evidence synthesis using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach [88]. This approach includes an assessment of the methodological limitations, coherence, relevance, and adequacy. Lastly, we integrated the main quantitative and qualitative findings by mapping key correlates and themes that emerged from the data to subjective and psychological wellbeing dimensions [13, 72]. Thereafter, we interpreted our data drawing on the relationality meaning model [60].",

Perceived contributors included forms of internalised stigma, characterised as fear of the rejection and isolation if HIV status was accidentally disclosed to peers [100], partners [101\u2013104] or parents [103, 105, 106]. Hence, keeping one\u2019s HIV status undisclosed was often described as an everyday lived experience [107\u2013110]. Studies described how internalised stigma impeded ability to build \u201chealthy identities\u201d [104, 108, 111] and access social support [101]. Gendered social expectations appeared to facilitate internalised stigma and consequently limited disclosure. For example, in Uganda, a young woman living with HIV feared loss of social value if her intimate relationship was curtailed and hence opted for non-disclosure of her HIV status [101]. Similarly, young men living with HIV in Uganda felt unable to uphold masculine socio-cultural identities and thus chose not to disclose their HIV status to their parents in fear of the \u201closs of rights\u201d to endowments [105, 106]. Most studies described the manifestations of HIV-related stigma in terms of experienced stigma, which was encountered in relationships with mothers [112, 113], family members [101, 114], learners and educators (102Mutumba et al., 2015, 107, 115), and HCWs [115] [113]. Authors also described how stigma intersected with gendered attitudes towards sexuality and self-acceptance among young women [101, 115\u2013117], including cultural norms such as respect for elders [113, 118, 119].\nb)Social support",

Religion and faith were primarily expressed as \u201cbelief in God\u201d [100, 109, 111, 112, 116, 121, 123, 125]. Most authors perceived religion as bringing comfort and hope, as well as meaning and purpose in their lives. In addition, in a Namibian study, interpreting HIV acquisition as a \u201ctest or punishments from God\u201d helped a young woman to accept her HIV status [116]. Another major positive coping strategy that YPLHIV applied was future goal setting such as desire for marriage and children [107, 119, 125, 126]. Educational aspirations were perceived as bringing a sense of purpose or social value to participants\u2019 lives [107, 122]. In contrast, YPLHIV also utilised negative coping strategies such as social withdrawal [107, 108, 111], self-blame [102, 123] and anticipation of death [103, 104, 117].\niii.Standard of living",

These households were often described by authors as lacking economic security and social protection. In Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa, caregivers and community HCWs reported how food insecurity challenged ART adherence and positive mental health functioning among YPLHIV [104, 110, 111, 127]. Young men living with HIV often reported difficulty in establishing economic security as the sole reason for delaying sexual debut, marriage and having children [100, 103, 126]. In Uganda, two studies noted how young men had \u201cshattered dreams\u201d [112] as household poverty traps prevented young men from completing their schooling, achieving their career aspirations and entering into the formal labour market. A young man\u2019s inability to contribute to his household made him feel \u201cunwanted\u201d and \u201churt\u201d [114].",

In contrast, our synthesis also revealed that in certain instances, social networks and gender norms embedded within these networks compromised wellbeing. Based on our evidence, dimensions that potentially constitute wellbeing for YPLHIV can be mapped onto the following PWB dimensions: 1) self-acceptance \u2014 internalised stigma, externalised stigma, social acceptance; 2) belonging \u2014 family connectedness; 3) autonomy \u2014 disclosure, sexual intercourse; 4) positive relations \u2014 social support; 5) environmental mastery \u2014 positive and negative coping; 6) purpose in life \u2014 religious activities, educational aspirations .",

However, our findings suggest that social networks have both benefits and liabilities for wellbeing among YPLHIV in this setting, which is consistent with recent evidence that highlights the positive and negative relational mechanisms of social networks on SWB [129], particularly among adolescents [130]. Our quantitative synthesis showed a strong positive correlation between HIV-related stigma and poor mental functioning which may likely reduce overall wellbeing as shown in previous studies among adults living with HIV in SSA [131] and high income countries [132]. Drawing on our qualitative review findings together with the relational meaning model [60] and Goffman\u2019s accounts of stigma [133], internalised stigma may reduce wellbeing by lowering self-worth. In addition, externalised stigma encountered within social networks may reduce connectedness of self with family members and peers [102, 112, 134]. Together, these processes are likely to challenge self-acceptance. The effects of stigma on wellbeing are likely be more pronounced for sexually HIV-positive young women, who, due to the intersection of stigma with sexual norms, may harbour heightened feelings of shame and rejection [113, 116]. These findings suggest that wellbeing measures which focus on self-acceptance and self-worth may be appropriate for this population.",

In addition, the absence of relationships, particularly with fathers, may have reduced belongingness [114]. Family belonging has been shown to mediate pathways to SWB [135] and PWB [136] among adolescents in developed settings, possibly via promotion of meaning in life [137].

It is plausible that these strong social networks also promote PWB as shown in a previous adolescent study from Brazil [138]. Accounts from our qualitative synthesis suggest that YPLHIV drew on the emotional support from family, peers and HCWs members during challenging life events (i.e. disclosure, adherence challenges, rejection) which may have helped maintain positive mental health and potentially PWB [102, 103, 109]. However, in instances where supportive social networks were limited, we found that YPLHIV drew on negative coping mechanisms (e.g. social withdrawal, self-blame) [104], which likely reduced their PWB [139]. Our findings suggest that social support positively impacts PWB by adding meaning to life, specifically on an intra-personal level such as improving one\u2019s sense of environmental mastery (e.g. ART adherence), a dimension of PWB. Our findings suggest that wellbeing measures should also encompass dimensions related to positive relations and environmental mastery.",

            "text": "Overall, our findings support the use of multi-dimensional relational wellbeing scales aligned to life domains which are important to YPLHIV (i.e. family, religion, education, living standards). Subjective wellbeing scales that consider these domains include the Personal Wellbeing Index [42] and the Student Life Satisfaction Scale [41]. The Personal Wellbeing Index has been applied in South Africa\u2019s national social attitudes survey of individuals aged 16 years and older [143]. The Personal Wellbeing Index has exhibited good scale reliability among adolescents in developing countries [144] whereas the Student Life Satisfaction Scale has shown favourable psychometric properties among children in South Africa [145]. Broader wellbeing scales such as Ryff\u2019s PWB scale and the Mental Health Continuum Short- Form have shown strong alignment with themes that emerged in our synthesis (i.e. social support, belonging, purpose in life, self-acceptance). These PWB scales have shown good validity among adolescent populations in the North [146]. In addition, the Mental Health Continuum Short- Form has shown strong alignment with conceptualisation of a good life among adolescents in South Africa [65]. Further studies are needed to validate these wellbeing measures among YPLHIV in SSA, paying careful attention to translational issues [147, 148]. These proposed scales are relatively brief and can be either self- or interviewer- administered in national economic or HIV surveys, including programme evaluations. In addition, key dimensions of wellbeing in this setting (e.g. positive relations, acceptance, coping) could be used as key output measures in monitoring and evaluation frameworks of multi-sectoral HIV policies and programmes to indirectly assess wellbeing impacts. Our findings also highlight the importance of including social support, stigma, gender and living standards as explanatory variables in econometric models examining the wellbeing effects of HIV/AIDS policies among YPLHIV.",

            "text": "This review is subject to the following limitations: 1) key population groups such as LGTBQI, sex workers and injecting drug users were excluded, as their lived experiences are likely to be different given the higher levels of stigma they possibly encounter relative to the general population of YPLHIV [149\u2013151]; 2) several applicable regional conferences lack online abstract and thus our review may have missed potentially relevant material; 3) our review focused only on YPLHIV in SSA and thus findings may not be generalisable to other regions. However, results from recent studies suggest that there are similarities between YPLHIV in SSA and other developing nations within the South-East Asia Region and Region of the Americas in terms of correlates of mental illness [81, 152] and adherence [153, 154]. Hence, results could be relevant to settings with similar disease and socio-economic profiles. Several gaps in our evidence base were identified. First, no study directly assessed correlates of wellbeing (using a wellbeing scale) or evaluated experiences of subjective or psychological wellbeing. Second, there were no data from Central Africa, with only one study from West Africa. Third, our evidence is not generalisable to YPLHIV in the community given that most studies sampled individuals from healthcare facilities. Fourth, variability in outcome definition and scale choice made it difficult to compare between quantitative studies and did not allow for a meta-analysis. Fifth, the lack of age-stratified data limited our ability to compare correlates and wellbeing by relevant age-bands (15\u201319 vs. 20\u201324 yrs.). Sixth, weaknesses in the study design and analytical techniques used in the quantitative evidence limited out ability to draw out any causal interpretations. Lastly, for the qualitative review, data saturation among 20\u201324-year-olds and YPLHIV in rural settings was not reached, leaving gaps in our understanding of how these factors may have shaped wellbeing.",

Understanding the wellbeing effects of HIV/AIDS policies could help steer policies in the direction that meets the broader needs of YPLHIV. This review has shown that social support was a key correlate of poor mental health and that social relationships shaped positive lived experiences. In view of the negative association between poor mental health functioning and measures of wellbeing found in the literature, it is plausible to posit that in this population wellbeing is multi-dimensional and that relational dimensions frame wellbeing among YPLHIV. Multi-dimensional wellbeing scales with a strong relational focus that could be applicable for this group include the Personal Wellbeing Index, Ryff\u2019s PWB and Mental Health Continuum Short-Form. Future studies should go beyond the investigation of mental health and examine wellbeing, based on definitions grounded in theory, to provide more accurate data on the wellbeing effects of policies. However, psychometric evaluations of these scales in this population in SSA are warranted, together with validation of these scales against adolescents and young people\u2019s subjective experiences in SSA.",
