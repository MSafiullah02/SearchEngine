It implies not only the physical arrival of the species, but also its successful establishment within the local community. Oceanic islands, like the Hawaiian and the Galapagos archipelagos, represent excellent systems to study the mechanisms of colonization because of their historical isolation. Ecosystem isolation was one of the most important premises used by MacArthur and Wilson (1967) for postulating the theory of Island Biogeography. In this landmark theory, they proposed that the number of species present in an isolated natural community is determined by both immigration and extinction rates. Immigration rates depend on the distance separating the island from potential sources of colonization (distance effect), while the size of the island limits resource and habitat availability and influences species extinction rates (species-area effect).",

However, the observed patterns of parasite species richness do not always fit these simple general laws of biogeography due to the complexity of host-parasite interactions and co-evolution (Poulin 2004; Strona and Fattorini 2014).",

Such direct immigration can be the result of active dispersal, and this mechanism is typically restricted to larger arthropod parasites or parasitoids with strong flying capacity such as parasitic wasps (Iqbal and Austin 2002; Masner and Johnson 2007). Other parasitic microorganisms have motile, free-living stages, but the distances they can travel are measured in centimeters rather than kilometers, and these short dispersals generally involve host-seeking behaviors. For instance, skin-penetrating nematodes such as hookworms can move quickly in the soil as they search for hosts using chemical cues (Castelletto et al. 2014), and uniflagellated zoospores of the highly lethal Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis\u2014a widespread amphibian pathogenic fungus\u2014can only swim for 24 h over few centimeters in still medium (Piotrowski et al. 2004). Thus, we do not consider host-seeking movements as active dispersal, at least not at a scale relevant to colonization of remote islands.",

The aerial dispersal of plant pathogens, especially fungal spores, has largely contributed to the global spread of important crop diseases like the sugarcane rust or coffee leaf rust (Brown and Hovmoller 2002). Some animal pathogens can also survive several days or weeks outside of their host and can be spread by aerosols and reach naive hosts. Notably, wind dispersal has played a role in various outbreaks of foot and mouth disease virus and avian influenza virus in Europe (Keeling et al. 2001; Ypma et al. 2013). Other parasites may use water currents to reach new areas. Pathogenic bacterial species such as Vibrio cholera can form biofilms in marine and freshwater environments, facilitating their persistence and dispersal (Hall-Stoodley and Stoodley 2005). The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii can survive in seawater for up to 24 months and remain infective, and oocysts shed with felid feces in freshwater runoff are a likely source of infections in marine ecosystems (Conrad et al. 2005; Lindsay and Dubey 2009).",

Ancestors of endemic species may have brought their parasites with them, leading to their coevolution in isolation. Such patterns can be found in some malaria parasite lineages restricted to endemic avian hosts in the Lesser Antilles (Fallon et al. 2005), or in Hepatozoon parasites of endemic reptiles in Seychelles or New Zealand (Godfrey et al. 2011; Harris et al. 2011). Newly arrived parasites can also switch to local hosts, sometimes even distantly related to their original host. This is the case for native helminth parasites of Hawaiian stream fishes that most likely colonized the islands with native fish-eating birds and marine fishes (Font 2003).",

Although seabirds often show high breeding site fidelity, colonies can be visited by transient birds (e.g., immature birds, failed breeders) or by infested birds deserting their colonies, which facilitates the colonization of new locations by parasites (Brown and Brown 2004; Dietrich et al. 2011). Many bird species also naturally travel long distances and may use islands as stop-over sites during their migration or foraging, carrying along parasites. Wild migrating birds and seabirds play an important role in the global spread of avian influenza and Lyme disease, respectively (Olsen et al. 1995; Olsen et al. 2006; Kilpatrick et al. 2006a).",

Human colonization has been followed by species extirpation since prehistoric times (Milberg and Tyrberg 1993). The introduction of invasive species and diseases by humans is a major cause of disturbance of natural communities around the globe, and islands have not been spared (Blackburn et al. 2004; Bellard et al. 2016). Parasite invasions of islands can originate from accidental transport of invasive hosts and vectors (Wyatt et al. 2008), or the deliberate introduction of domestic animals (Bunbury et al. 2008) and game (Diamond and Veitch 1981). Probably one of the most famous examples of the impact of introduced parasites on insular wildlife is the decline of the Hawaiian endemic avifauna following the introduction of the avian malaria Plasmodium relictum, avianpox virus, and their mosquito vector Culex quinquefasciatus (Warner 1968; van Riper et al. 1986, 2002). In some rare cases, parasites are deliberately introduced in new areas as a mean to control invasive species. The most notorious example is the introduction of myxoma virus in Australia in the 1950s to control invasive rabbit populations (Fenner et al. 1957).",

Notably, parasites in aggregated distributions among few hosts are more susceptible to \u201cmissing the boat\u201d and going extinct (Paterson et al. 1999; MacLeod et al. 2010).

Infecting naive hosts allows parasites to remain in the new ecosystem even if the original, colonizing host goes extinct or is only transient (Smith and Carpenter 2006). Therefore, the capacity of the parasite to infect a wide range of hosts contributes greatly to its persistence after colonization. It has been argued that all parasites, except true specialists, can switch hosts rapidly if they can exploit newly available resources without having to evolve novel capacities (Hoberg and Brooks 2008). Lower prevalence and smaller distributions of host-specific avian blood parasites in island systems compared to widespread host-generalists provide support for this idea (Beadell et al. 2004; Ewen et al. 2012; Clark and Clegg 2015).",

            "text": "The Galapagos flycatcher\n(Myiarchus magnirostris) colonized the Galapagos Islands about 850,000 years ago, and their closest relatives are the Brown-crested flycatchers (Myiarchus tyrannulus) from Central America (Sari and Parker 2012). In order to investigate which parasites colonized the archipelago with their hosts, Sari et al. (2013) sampled mites, lice, and blood parasites from Galapagos flycatchers on seven Galapagos islands and also from Brown-crested flycatchers at four locations in Costa Rica. These authors described a suite of six mite and louse species infecting Galapagos flycatchers, of which five species are shared with the Brown-crested flycatchers, leading to the conclusion that these mites and lice arrived to Galapagos together with their bird hosts when they naturally colonized the archipelago. Taking a closer look at the morphology of this ectoparasite assemblage, Sari et al. (2013) reported that only one of these species, a mite from the genus Nycteridocaulus (Family Proctophyllodidae), has evolved evident morphological differentiation between the two host species, leading to the conclusion that the Nycteridocaulus from the Galapagos flycatcher is probably not conspecific with that from the Brown-crested flycatcher. The other mite and louse species have the same morphological characteristics and taxonomic classification, for both host species. However, genetic distance between Ricinus marginatus lice collected from both host species was found to be almost ten times larger than the genetic distance between their hosts (Sari et al. 2013). Both hosts and their lice have been evolving in allopatry for about 850,000 years (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-65909-1_2), but evident speciation was only observed in the bird hosts (Sari et al. 2013). These findings add to the body of knowledge indicating that morphological evolution tends to be more conservative in parasites than their hosts (Klassen 1992) and suggest that the process of speciation for lice can take much longer than it takes for their hosts, as mentioned by McDowall (2000).",

The Galapagos hawk colonized the archipelago about 300,000 years ago and its closest related continental species is the Swainson\u2019s Hawk (Buteo swainsoni) (Bollmer et al. 2006; Amaral et al. 2009) (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-65909-1_2). Five species of ectoparasites have been found on hawks on several of the Galapagos islands: one hippoboscid fly (Icosta nigra), three species of lice (Degeeriella regalis, Colpocephalum turbinatum, and Craspedorrhynchus sp.), and one skin mite (Myialges caulotoon) (Whiteman et al. 2006, 2007, 2009). All these species are also found on Swainson\u2019s hawks and are thought to have colonized Galapagos together with their hawk host (Price et al. 2003; Parker et al. 2006). Whiteman et al. (2009) looked at variation in both morphology and DNA sequences for one of these species, the head louse Craspedorrhynchus sp., in populations of Galapagos hawks and Swainson\u2019s hawks in North and South America. They found approximately 10% genetic divergence between lice from the two host species, while almost no genetic differentiation was found between the Galapagos and the Swainson\u2019s hawks used in this study (only one base pair in 497 nucleotides sequenced of COI). In contrast, hawks from Galapagos and Swainson\u2019s hawks are strikingly different in morphology but the Craspedorrhynchus lice found on the two hosts showed a lot of overlap in morphological characteristics. Subtle morphological differences, however, were observed in the head and genitalia of lice between the two host species, allowing the identification of their geographical origin and possibly lineage diversification.",

However, these lice have different prevalence on different islands, demonstrating that the relationships among parasites, hosts, and islands are idiosyncratic (Rivera-Parra et al. 2014). Nematode parasites that colonized Galapagos together with the founding population of the Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis nigra species complex) also show a similar island-dependent distribution (Fourni\u00e9 et al. 2015). Each Galapagos tortoise species is found only on one island, and each island has a different combination of nematodes. Fourni\u00e9 et al.

Four lineages of Plasmodium parasites\nhave been identified in the Galapagos (Levin et al. 2009, 2013). One lineage was repeatedly detected in Galapagos penguins and occasionally in yellow warblers and the other three were only detected in one or a handful of Galapagos birds at one location, at one given time (Levin et al. 2013). A very large sampling effort (nearly 4000 birds molecularly screened for blood parasites) was needed in order to reveal these few rare lineages. Interestingly, two of the rare lineages were perfect DNA matches with Plasmodium lineages amplified from North American breeding bobolink samples (Levin et al. 2013). Although this is not confirmation that migratory bobolinks introduced these rare lineages to the Galapagos, it is evidence that the islands may be exposed to more potential parasite introductions than previously thought. It is not currently known whether these rare lineages have established in the islands.\n",

By comparing the blood parasites found in North American breeding bobolinks to those found in the brown-headed cowbird, a short-distance migrant that breeds in sympatry, the authors were able to begin teasing apart the potential origins of the rare Galapagos Plasmodium lineages (Levin et al. 2016). If the Galapagos Plasmodium lineage is shared between bobolinks and cowbirds and predominantly matches DNA sequences from other North American hosts, the colonizing lineage is likely of North American origin. If this lineage is detected in bobolinks but not cowbirds and matches predominantly South American sequences, then the origin is mostly likely South American. Bobolinks stop over in Galapagos only during their southward migration, but could still harbor chronic infections by parasites acquired many months before, while overwintering. Indeed, one of the Plasmodium lineages\nfound in Galapagos birds was likely of North American origin, while the other match was likely from South America (Levin et al. 2016). More work is needed to further understand the probability of colonization by blood parasites (and other parasites) via migratory birds. Recently, several bobolinks have been sampled in Galapagos in October during migration (P. Parker, personal communication). By far the most abundant migratory birds in Galapagos are shorebirds, and to our knowledge, none have been tested for blood parasites.",

All analyses placed the Galapagos population of A. taeniorhynchus within one single coherent cluster clearly separated from the continental mosquito populations. This result suggests that the Galapagos population of A. taeniorhynchus originated from a single colonization event and now represents a distinct evolutionary unit divergent from the continental populations. Molecular clock analysis\nestimated that the Galapagos and continental clades diverged 176,000 years ago (95% confidence interval: 93,000\u2013352,000 years). Although imprecise, this estimation demonstrated that the colonization by A. taeniorhynchus was not human-driven.",

First, the strong flying capacity of A. taeniorhynchus is well known, and long-distance dispersal has been observed various times in this species (Provost 1951; Bello et al. 2005). Arrival of A. taeniorhynchus in Galapagos could have been facilitated by the strong wind and oceanic current found in the Intertropical Convergence Zone during cyclic climatic fluctuations such as El Ni\u00f1o events (Peck 1994). Second, A. taeniorhynchus lays desiccation-resistant eggs, which has been significantly associated with the success of invasive mosquito introductions in new areas (Juliano and Lounibos 2005). Third, larvae of A. taeniorhynchus successfully grow in water with a wide range of salinity (Clark et al. 2004), which gives them the possibility to breed in a wide range of habitats across the archipelago, notably in the mangroves found throughout the coasts of the archipelago.",

However, these results do not provide direct evidence for the role of A. taeniorhynchus in the transmission of these parasites. Mosquitoes are not the typical vectors of Haemoproteus spp., although some studies have supported this possibility (Ishtiaq et al. 2008). Galapagos microfilarial nematodes infect the flightless cormorants and the Galapagos penguins (Merkel et al. 2007). They may be transmitted by multiple vector species, but Aedes taeniorhynchus is thought to be one important vector for this parasite, because microfilariae prevalence across its hosts\u2019 ranges correlates with ecological factors suitable for A. taeniorhynchus populations (Siers et al. 2010), and this mosquito was shown to feed on cormorants (Bataille et al. 2012). Hepatozoon parasites were also detected by PCR in both thoraces and heads of mosquitoes. Aedes taeniorhynchus could be involved in the transmission of this parasite by accidental ingestion of infected mosquitoes, but maybe also by mosquito bites (Telford et al. 2001). This mosquito could also be a mechanical vector (i.e., transfer of the parasite without passage within the vector necessary for the parasite\u2019s life cycle) of avipoxvirus between birds in the archipelago (Thiel et al. 2005).",

Although some are wingless (e.g., sheep ked), most hippoboscids have fully functional wings. Despite the ability to fly, hippoboscids tend to remain closely associated with their hosts, with only one off-host life stage: female hippoboscids lay a single, late-instar larva, which pupates in the ground. Hippoboscid flies are common on Galapagos seabirds, the Galapagos hawk, and the Galapagos dove (Whiteman et al. 2007; Valkiunas et al. 2010; Levin et al. 2012) (see Fig. 3.4). The flies tend to be very host-specific, with one fly species per host species (or a few closely related host species). For example, over the course of sampling >100 flies from great and magnificent frigatebirds and blue-footed, red-footed, and Nazca boobies, the species of hippoboscid that infects boobies, Olfersia aenescens, was never found on a frigatebird and vice versa, despite the fact that these seabirds often breed in dense, multi-species colonies with ample opportunity for flies to host-switch (I. Levin, personal observation.). Hippoboscid flies are definitive hosts for blood parasites in the subgenus Haemoproteus haemoproteus (Valkiunas 2005; Levin et al. 2011). Because of the host-specificity of the flies, lineages of H. haemoproteus are often specific to a particular host and fly pair (Valkiunas et al. 2010; Levin et al. 2011, 2012).\n",

            "text": "For reasons already mentioned, it is difficult to determine the order and combination of arrival in Galapagos: did colonizing birds arrive infected with flies and Haemoproteus? Or did the flies and Haemoproteus arrive later? Perhaps the most parsimonious explanation is that colonizing birds were infected with both parasite and vector, but we have little evidence to back up this claim. The various DNA lineages of found infecting Galapagos doves were also detected in continental South American dove species (Santiago-Alarcon et al. 2010). These lineages do not appear to have diversified recently from one single lineage, which would be evidence of differentiation within the Galapagos archipelago since arrival. Instead, it seems plausible that this parasite was introduced recently and multiple times to Galapagos, probably via a vagrant dove host like the eared dove (Zenaida auriculata) or with introduced rock doves, both of which have been found to be hosts of H. multipigmentatus (Santiago-Alarcon et al. 2010; Valkiunas et al. 2010). Rock doves were introduced to Galapagos in the early 1970s and are now completely eradicated from the islands, but H. multipigmentatus was also detected in rock doves once collected in Galapagos (P. Parker, personal communication). Interestingly, rock doves in continental areas are infected with the hippoboscid fly Pseudolynchia canariensis, while the flies found infecting Galapagos doves belong to the species , so the role of the supposed vector of H. multipigmentatus in Galapagos in these multiple colonization events is currently unknown.",

            "text": "In contrast, Galapagos frigatebird species are infected with just one lineage of Haemoproteus iwa, which is probably vectored by the hippoboscid fly, Olfersia spinifera (Levin et al. 2011). Vector confirmation for both M. galapagoensis and O. spinifera involved DNA amplification of Haemoproteus from fly thorax without amplification of avian host DNA, indicating developing parasite (sporozoite) in the thorax (Valkiunas et al. 2010; Levin et al. 2011). Although Galapagos frigatebirds are genetically isolated from frigatebirds in the rest of their tropical range (Hailer et al. 2010; see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-65909-1_2), only one Haemoproteus iwa lineage has ever been recovered both in Galapagos birds and frigatebirds in other locations (Levin et al. 2011). Magnificent frigatebirds colonized the Galapagos archipelago approximately 247,200 years ago (95% confidence intervals: 82,800\u2013647,400) (Hailer et al. 2010). Using the estimated DNA sequence divergence rate for the hemosporidian cytochrome b gene (1.2% per million years, Ricklefs and Outlaw 2010), the lack of sequence divergence within Galapagos is consistent with the parasite and vector arriving with the colonizing host (Levin et al. 2011). However, it is still possible that the parasite and fly vector are more recent arrivals. Frigatebirds are philopatric to their breeding site, but travel great distances during the non-breeding season (Dearborn et al. 2003; Weimerskirch et al. 2006). We know that hippoboscid flies do regularly move between host individuals at a local scale; interestingly, the flies that do move between birds are less likely to be infected with Haemoproteus iwa (Levin and Parker 2014). In order to fully understand the colonization history of hippoboscid fly vectors in Galapagos , large-scale phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies of Haemoproteus parasites, bird hosts, and hippoboscid flies are needed, with an effort to estimate arrival dates where possible.",

Parasites introduced with chickens have been particularly well studied. Several surveys carried out on chickens from inhabited islands of the archipelago (Gottdenker et al. 2005; Soos et al. 2008; Deem et al. 2012) indicated infection by Mycoplasma gallisepticum, a globally distributed bacterium that causes chronic respiratory disease in poultry and conjunctivitis in wild birds (Williams et al. 2002), and by nine different types of viruses, including the contagious Newcastle disease (avian paramyxovirus 1) that infects many domestic and wild avian species (Alexander et al. 2012). Antibodies to Newcastle virus and to an adenovirus (Adenovirus-2) were also detected in Galapagos finches on Floreana Island, suggesting potential spillover from poultry to wild birds (Deem et al. 2012). Multiple nematode, cestode, trematode, and protozoan parasites were also identified, including a Dyspharynx nematode that has been associated with mortalities in Galapagos dark-billed cuckoos (Gottdenker et al. 2005). Marek\u2019s disease, caused by a herpesvirus, is also present and caused mortality in Galapagos domestic poultry in 1995/1996, but risks for native Galapagos avifauna are considered low because there are no susceptible native galliform species in the archipelago (Miller et al. 2001; Gottdenker et al. 2005).",

This canarypox virus lineage can have a major impact on the survival of some endemic passerine populations during stressful environmental conditions like El Ni\u00f1o events (Curry and Grant 1989). Examination of museum specimens suggested that this avipoxvirus arrived to the archipelago in the late 1890s, possibly with early settlers, or via a natural colonization with migrating passerines like Bobolinks (see Sect. 3.2) (Parker et al. 2011). Despite the difference in hosts between fowlpox and canarypox viruses, the sympatry of the two pox lineages in some areas may allow for recombination and virulence alteration of avian pox viruses in Galapagos (Thiel et al. 2005). The transmission of avian pox in the archipelago is probably facilitated by endemic and introduced mechanical vectors (see sections on vectors above and below).",

Infected cats can notably transmit the parasite to other hosts via ingestion of contaminated feces. Infection by T. gondii was observed in many species of birds across the globe (Dubey 2002), including the endemic bird \u2018Alala from Hawaii (Work et al. 2000). In Galapagos, low prevalence (1\u20138%) of antibodies to T. gondii was detected in Galapagos penguins and flightless cormorants (Deem et al. 2010).",

The best approaches for studying colonization include detailed phylogeographic and population genetic approaches. When possible, researchers should sample the entire parasite community in and on Galapagos animals and their closest continental relatives. By sampling parasite assemblages, we can reconstruct more accurate hypotheses about parasite arrival and divergence within Galapagos. For example, by examining all species of lice and mites found on the Galapagos flycatcher and their most closely related continental sister taxa, the Brown-crested flycatcher, Sari et al. (2013) concluded that the suite of ectoparasites probably arrived with the ancestor of the Galapagos flycatcher and that only one mite species had diverged in morphology since arrival to Galapagos. Sampling only the divergent mite could have led to a different conclusion. Furthermore, vertically transmitted and closely host-associated parasites can be used as additional evidence for revealing host evolutionary history (Whiteman and Parker 2005). Thus, studying parasite colonization adds more information about the evolutionary history of Galapagos than simply an answer to how that particular parasite colonized the islands.",

Host-specific parasites are of less concern because their most plausible route of introduction is with the host, and even if they arrived, they are less likely to establish on a novel host. There is still concern about the introduction of parasites via migratory birds, but there is little that can be done to prevent parasite spread from migratory sources, except regular avian screening (see Fig. 3.7). For example, there is concern about the potential arrival of , the pathogenic hemosporidian species that has contributed to the decline and extinction of many Hawaiian honeycreepers. Plasmodium relictum could arrive to Galapagos via an infected bird, but in order for the parasite to establish, a competent vector is needed. Unfortunately, the vector of this lineage in Hawaii, Culex quinquefasciatus, is well established in Galapagos. Preventing the colonization of P. relictum would require eliminating the introduced C. quinquefasciatus, which is not a simple task.
