Therefore, each amino acid is encoded by several codons, with the exception of two amino acids (methionine and tryptophan). This codon redundancy results in synonymous codon usage, whereby one amino acid is encoded by 2, 4, or 6 codons [2]. Several previous studies have revealed that synonymous codons are utilized with different frequencies and are not randomly used by different genomes or genes. This non-randomness is referred to as codon usage bias [3, 4]. Each species preferentially uses different synonymous codons [5]. This results in a species-specific codon usage bias.",

Codons and anti-codons in tRNA do not interact in a one-to-one fashion [7]. Base pairing at the third codon position is wobble; for example, G can pair with both cytosine (C) and uracil (U) [8]. It has been demonstrated that tRNA modification directly affects tRNA and mRNA wobble base pairing [9, 10]. Both the available tRNA isoacceptors and tRNA modification change with the cell cycle, and they can be altered by cellular stresses [11, 12]. For efficient protein translation, the codon usage pattern should correlate with the population of available tRNA isoacceptors [13]. In the cellular stress-response, the alteration could enhance the expression of stress-response genes, with the codon usage patterns compatible with the changed tRNA modifications. Those genes shown to be regulated by this codon-specific manner are called Modification Tunable Transcripts (MoTTs) [12, 14].",

            "text": "Two major models have been proposed to explain the causes of codon usage bias: mutation pressure, and translational selection [15]. As to mutation pressure, it is believed that GC content is the major factor driving codon usage bias [16, 17]. The high mutation rates of some nucleotides or codons result in nucleotide substitution that might contribute to lower frequencies of some nucleotides and codons [15]. Mutation pressure has been suggested to be the most important factor determining the codon usage bias in human RNA viruses [18, 19, 20]. However, there are correlations between the codon usage bias and other factors related to translation efficiency (such as available tRNAs, mRNA secondary structure, translation elongation rate, and the intragenic and intergenic codon bias) that cannot be explained by mutation pressure. This suggests that translational selection also influences codon usage bias [15]. The translational selection acts on codon usage bias to achieve efficient and accurate translation. The use of codons correlates with abundant tRNAs, resulting in a higher translation rate [21, 22, 23]. A correlation between codon usage bias and abundant tRNAs has been found in prokaryotes (such as E. coli [24]) and in some eukaryotes (such as S. cerevisiae [25], C. elegans [22], Drosophila [23], and human [26]). However, rare codons are preferred to encode some specific sets of genes or regions of genes, for instance, to enable protein oscillation in different phases of the cell cycle, slow down protein translation across the membrane, and reduce ribosome jamming and mRNA secondary structure at the 5\u2032end of coding sequences [11, 27, 28, 29]. Therefore, the translational selection acting on the optimization of frequent and rare codon utilization is important in appropriate gene translation.",

Thus, one would intuitively think that the codon usage of a viral genome should match that of its host in order to be efficiently expressed. Surprisingly, however, most viruses have codon usage patterns that are different from the codon usage preference of their hosts [30, 31, 32, 33]. A previous study indicated an alteration in the cellular tRNA level after the infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [34]. In contrast, the cellular tRNA level was found to be unchanged following vaccinia and influenza A virus (IAV) infection, whereas an alteration in the polysome-associated tRNA population was observed, particularly the population of polysome tRNA isoacceptors correlated with viral codon usage [35]. These findings suggest that the codon usage pattern and the regulation of translational machineries may influence gene expression in some viruses.",

The open reading frames (ORFs) of the protein coding sequences were rechecked by ORFfinder (NCBI) before performing the RSCU calculation. The RSCU is a simple parameter that represents the codon usage bias of synonymous codons in a coding sequence. In our analysis, the RSCU was calculated from the protein coding sequences of the human and RNA viruses. The RSCU of each gene consists of 59 values corresponding to 59 synonymous codons; thus, the PCA was performed to simplify the data to a smaller number of principal factors as a summary feature of the codon usage pattern of each gene. The PCA successfully reduced the 59 values of each RSCU into two significant components. The RSCUs of the human genes and RNA viruses were represented by the coordinates of principal component 1 (PC1, x-axis) and principal component 2 (PC2, y-axis) plotted on the PCA of an RSCU graph (Figure 1\n).

CAI is a common parameter used to assess the codon usage bias of a gene. It is calculated from the frequency of the overall codons in a given protein coding sequence with respect to a reference set of genes [37]. In our analysis, the human codon usage table, which is the average codon frequency of a human genome, was used as the reference set. From the results (Figure 1), the PCA of the RSCU of the human codon usage table was plotted near the x and y intercepts, showing the average codon usage pattern of all human genes. A number of human genes in the PCA of the RSCU graph were selected and subjected to the CAI calculation. The graphs of PC1 and CAI, of PC2 and CAI, were plotted; the linear regression and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) were subsequently analyzed. From Figure 2\nA, it was found that the CAI of genes gradually decreased with an increase in PC1 (R2 = 0.7958, PCC = -0.8921, p-value <0.0001), while a positive correlation was observed between CAI and PC2 (R2 = 0.5824, PCC = 0.7631, p-value < 0.0001). The percentages of the GC content at the third position of the codon (%G+C(3)) of the human genes were also determined. In a similar way to CAI (Figure 2B), %G+C(3) gradually decreased with an increase in PC1 (R2 = 0.9459, PCC = -0.9726, p-value < 0.0001). A weak correlation between PC2 and %G+C(3) was observed (R2 = 0.4373, PCC = 0.6613, p-value < 0.0001). Thus, the PCA of the RSCU analysis could be used to characterize the heterogeneity of the codon usage bias in the human genome, in which genes in the left-upper quadrant contain more optimal codon usage for high expression, whereas those in the right quadrants near or below the x-axis have less optimal codon usage.",

Moreover, there are significant variations of codon usage bias among different species, and even among genes in the same organism [5, 21]. Theoretically, two major factors shape the codon usage bias: mutation pressure and translational selection [18]. Mutation pressure can result in uneven frequencies of nucleotide content, which can in turn influence codon usage bias [15, 47]. As to translational optimization, the frequent codons are usually found correlated with the population of tRNA isoacceptors [13, 15]. Thus, the frequent or optimal codons would result in more rapid protein translation due to the greater availability of tRNAs corresponding to the frequently used codons [48].",

The G-to-A hypermutation in the HIV-1 genome has been attributed to viral reverse transcriptase (RT), which lacks 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease proofreading activity, leading to the misincorporation of nucleotides [50, 51]. In addition, the function of host enzymes of the APOBEC3 (A3) family has been found to partially contribute to a G-to-A mutation [52, 53]. Furthermore, a difference in codon usage has been observed among individual genes of HIV-1 [51]. The HIV-1 gag gene, encoded for structural protein, adopts a great difference in codon usage pattern compared to human host cells. In contrast, the HIV-1 genes involved in the regulation of the replication cycle, tat and rev genes, have been demonstrated to be more similar to human codon usage bias [54].",

We demonstrated that the PCA of RSCU analysis is compatible with a well-established index, CAI. This suggested that the PCA of RSCU could be used in assessing codon usage bias and comparing the difference in codon usage pattern. In particular, the PCA of RSCU allowed a comparison to be made of individual genes in the whole genome scale. Human genes possess various, different codon usage patterns, as observed in each quadrant of a graph. As mentioned earlier, there are a number of human genes located densely in the right quadrants; these genes adopt a non-optimal codon usage pattern similar to CCR genes. Although most of the RNA viruses have a non-optimal codon usage pattern, a great variation in codon usage patterns was observed among the groups of +ssRNA, dsRNA, and retroviruses. The greatest difference in the codon usage patterns belonged to rotavirus, as seen in the graph. By comparison, the rubella virus exhibited a more similar codon usage pattern to humans. These results correspond with those of another study which demonstrated that the codon usage patterns of +ssRNA viruses are closer to human than other RNA viruses, and that the lowest CAI belongs to dsRNA viruses. In more detail, rubella virus (+ssRNA) had the highest CAI at 0.773, and rotavirus had the lowest CAI at 0.683 [55].",

However, the number of retrieved genes did not affect the significance level or the number of enriched GO terms in Figure 4; for instance, 898 genes for the \u2013ssRNA subgroup 3 resulted in only 1 enriched GO term, whereas 188 genes for the +ssRNA subgroup 7 resulted in 5 GO terms. This suggests that the enriched GO terms did not result from a bias from the different numbers of retrieved genes among the virus groups. It is also possible that some virus groups with a limited number of retrieved genes might not have had sufficient statistical power to enable the detection of enriched GO terms. Among the retrieved human genes, only the genes that adopted a non-optimal codon usage pattern retrieved from the area where they were located densely in the right quadrants gave significant overrepresented GO terms. This suggested that the difference in codon usage bias in human genes might have specific functions. The contribution of non-optimal codon usage bias in human genes on the regulation of protein expression has been investigated in previous research [11, 56, 57]. One study on CCR genes revealed that the non-optimal codon usage pattern generates the oscillation in protein expression during cell cycle progression [11]. We demonstrated that the RSCUs of RNA viruses were similar to the RSCUs of CCR genes, using both the CCCS calculation and the PCA of RSCU. The results showed that \u2013ssRNA, dsRNA, HIV-1, HIV-2, ambisense viruses, and a few viruses in the +ssRNA group exhibited non-optimal codon usage similar to that of the CCR genes. This suggests that despite having a non-optimal codon usage bias, viral genes might be efficiently expressed during the specific phase of the cell cycle correlated with the available tRNA population in that period.",

Alteration of the tRNA population depends on the level of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and cellular ATP concentration [59]. In yeast cells, oscillation of the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and ATP during the cell cycle has been found to result in an increase in tRNA levels in the G2/M phase, but a low tRNA level was observed toward the end of the G1 phase [11]. Therefore, with a low-charged tRNA concentration, the genes expressed during G1 prefer optimal codon usage bias, whereas the genes with non-optimal codon usage bias are highly expressed in the other phases of the cell cycle with a high-charged tRNA concentration [11]. The availability of charged tRNAs during the cell cycle may regulate protein translation in a codon usage-specific manner. Several studies have revealed viral subversion of the cell cycle by arresting via various mechanisms to generate the resources and favorable environment for viral replication and viral protein production [60]. Cell cycle arrest has been observed in both DNA and RNA virus infections. In some RNA viruses, cell cycle arrest at a specific phase may lead to an increase in viral protein translation [61]. During the G2/M phase, the expression of many proteins has been found to fluctuate by arresting at G2/M, viruses may use this mechanism to regulate protein expression [62]. Another study found that HIV-1 was more transcriptionally active during the G2 phase, and that arresting of the cell cycle may help limit the host immune response [63]. Moreover, an HIV-1 infection also causes an alteration at the cellular tRNA level [34]. As to avian coronavirus infections, G2/M arrest has been found with an increased viral protein expression [64]. Furthermore, rotavirus infection arrests the cell cycle in the S/G2 phase, favoring viral protein expression [61], while influenza A virus infection arrests the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, resulting in increased viral protein expression [65, 66]. These findings suggest that viruses may manipulate the cell cycle and cellular translation machinery to create available tRNA population favoring the viral codon usage pattern.",

            "text": "Several GO terms of human genes with codon usage patterns similar to RNA viruses have been found by previous studies to be identical to the GO terms of upregulated protein profiles in viral infections. Global proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes in HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells revealed that HIV-1 affected transcriptional and translational regulation, and targeted RNA or protein degradation in order to modulate biological processes (including signal transduction, cell cycle, metabolic processes, and the immune system) [42]. In addition, a study of ZIKV infected human neurospheres also found an upregulation profile of proteins involving cell cycle arrest. This resulted in an alteration of the cell cycle in order to regulate the transcription and translation of the host cells [44]. IAV infection targeted several cellular pathways to favor its replication, including aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and spliceosome [43]. Moreover, regulated proteins and phosphoproteins in DENV-infected cells were related to cellular macromolecule biosynthesis, RNA splicing, chromatin modification, and cell stress response, and these regulations help facilitate viral protein expression [45]. This suggests that human genes with codon usage patterns similar to that of viruses may be upregulated at the translational level in a viral infection. It is unclear whether viruses evolved to regulate the translational machinery in order to accommodate the codon usage pattern that had already been shaped by mutational pressure, or whether they adapted their codon usage pattern to match the cellular translational machinery condition in infected cells. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Further studies are required to gain more insight into this new aspect of the virus-host interaction.",
