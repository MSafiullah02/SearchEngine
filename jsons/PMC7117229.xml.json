            "text": "FIP is a usually fatal, immune-mediated, disease triggered by infection with FCoV, which can affect both domestic and wild felines (Pedersen, 1987; Barlough and Scott, 1988). The elucidation of FCoV epidemiology is essential to our understanding of FIP, but to study the FCoV infection it is necessary to be able to detect the virus. Unfortunately, most attempts to culture FCoV from clinical cases of FIP or from cats believed to have been exposed to FCoV have failed (Pedersen, 1987; Pedersen et al., 1984; Hohdatsu et al., 1992). While, in a number of studies, methods of demonstrating the virus in cats with clinical FIP have been found (Pedersen, 1987; Hok, 1989a, Hok, 1989b; Cammarata Parodi et al., 1993; Martinez and Weiss, 1993; Tammer et al., 1995), they are generally of little use as reliable diagnostic tools, and at the start of the study, there were no commercially available tests for the detection of the virus within chronically-infected, but clinically healthy cats. Since persistently infected cats may harbour FCoV in their intestines, blood or possibly tonsils, and shed the virus in faeces or saliva, these cats may act as a continued source of infection (Pedersen, 1987; Addie et al., 1996; Foley et al., 1997). Being able to detect these cats is essential, not only for our understanding of their role in the dissemination of the FCoV infection, but also in determining what role chronic viraemia may play in the induction of clinical FIP.",

This current study involved developing a successful method for the culture of FCoV, and an RT-PCR assay for the detection of the FCoV genome. It was then possible to determine (i) whether cats remained viraemic over time, (ii) whether or not the presence of viraemia led ultimately to the development of FIP, and (iii) whether this type of methodology could be used in the diagnosis of FIP.",

The inability to detect UCD1 and UCD3 may have resulted from failure of these strains to grow in WFE cells, since they are known to grow poorly in cell culture (Pedersen et al., 1984).

Interestingly, some of the bands seen running at the desired molecular weight were not detected by probing. There could be two reasons for this lack of hybridisation; (i) that the bands were due to mis-priming and were not FCoV-specific, or (ii) that while the bands were due to FCoV, mutations within the S gene prevented the probe from binding. In support for the latter theory is the finding that at least some of the extra bands did hybridise with the probe, and that coronaviruses are known to have a high level of mutation (Chen and Baric, 1995).",

None of the persistently-infected cats developed signs of clinical disease within this period of observation. Given this, and the overall lack of new FIP cases within the catteries, it appears logical to surmise that in most cats the persistence of viraemia is not associated with the development of disease.

While the presence of antibody generally correlated well with the presence of the virus, virus was not detected in all antibody-positive cats, and two of the viraemic cats lacked specific antibody. Seronegativity has been reported previously in cats with clinical FIP (Scott, 1986; Sparkes et al., 1991; Fehr et al., 1996) and healthy, but FCoV-infected individuals (Fehr et al., 1996; Richter et al., 1996; Herrewegh et al., 1997). Fehr et al. (1996), and Herrewegh et al. (1997)found a considerable proportion of healthy cats from mixed backgrounds to be seronegative for FCoV, despite being RT-PCR positive; eight of 18 cats (44%), and five of 16 cats (31%), respectively. Richter et al. (1996)found 10 out of 23 healthy but viraemic cats to be antibody-negative (44%), along with six of 28 cats with clinical FIP (21%). There are a number of possibilities for this apparent lack of serological response. In clinically ill cats, the lack of detectable antibody may be due to it being bound up in the form of immune complexes (Scott, 1986). However, since the seronegative cats in our study were not clinically ill, this appears to be an unlikely explanation. It is perhaps more likely that the lack of antibody relates to recent infection. This theory is supported by Richter et al. (1996), who found seven of the 10 viraemic, but seronegative cats, to be less than 12 weeks of age. At this age kittens are likely to have lost their maternally derived antibody, but may have only recently been exposed to the virus (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Foley et al., 1997). The possibility of recent infection may also explain three of the five cases identified by Herrewegh et al. (1997), since all three were under 10 months of age. The remaining healthy, seronegative, but viraemic cats, in the studies by Richter et al. (1996)and Herrewegh et al. (1997), were of a wide range of ages. Interestingly, three of the cats had previously tested seropositive for FCoV. Of the two seronegative cats in our study, one was only 6 months of age, and not available for further study, while the other was 3 years of age, and remained seronegative during the following year of observation, but became seropositive 18 months later. From these findings, it would appear that while some viraemic cats may be intermittently seropositive, others may fail to produce detectable antibody. The significance of these findings to development of disease remains unclear.",

However, the test has much to recommend it for the detection of persistently-infected `carrier' cats, and in the screening of cats prior to their introduction to FCoV-free breeding colonies. It will also be an important asset in the ongoing study into FCoV epidemiology.",

A similar percentage of samples tested positive for FCoV by direct RT-PCR and after 4 weeks of co-cultivation. This can be seen in the clinical FIP samples, where approximately 80% were positive by direct RT-PCR and 91% were positive after co-cultivation and RT-PCR, (73% being positive after co-cultivation, RT-PCR and probe). Interestingly, when samples from individual cats were assessed, the culture system was less predictable. Presumably, the viruses had to adapt to the cell-line in which they had been placed, and different isolates had differing abilities to do this. It is possible that, during the initial period of adaptation, most of the input virus failed to replicate, resulting in a reduced number of positive samples. As the adapted virus then began to grow more strongly, it again became detectable. The adaptation period appeared to take at least 4 weeks. As of this, for most samples the `without culture' samples gave the best chance of virus detection, followed by those assessed after either 1 or 4 weeks of culture. As the virus was difficult to detect in samples that had been cultured for between 2\u20133 weeks, the prevalence of FCoV viraemia may have been underestimated in groups of cats that were assessed at these times. An example of this may be seen with the cats of Group 3 (Table 3). These cats were assessed after their samples had been cultured for only 2 weeks. Fifteen of 27 cats (56%) were found to be infected by RT-PCR, as compared to ten of the 11 cats (91%) in Group 1, which were assessed after 4 weeks of culture.",

Controls against cross-contamination were stringent, so the most likely scenario is that the level of virus was undetectable in the initial samples, but co-cultivation allowed for its amplification. It may have been the case that, in these samples, the number of FCoV-infected white blood cells or the amount of intracellular virus was very small (Weiss and Scott, 1981). In vitro cultivation of the cells may have stimulated virus expression and/or replication, and so aided detection (Weiss and Scott, 1981). Studies in mice have been performed that show that antigen- or mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes acquire the capacity to replicate exogenous or endogenous viruses (Hirsch, 1976). Also, in vitro maintenance of PBMCs from infected animals can activate the expression or replication of certain viruses producing persistent infections (Stock and Ferrer, 1972; Rowe et al., 1997). Similarly, PBMCs from FCoV-infected cats may have acquired the capacity to express or replicate virus in vitro, to co-infect other cells, or to release soluble factors (e.g. cytokines) into the culture medium to activate virus within other cells (Weiss and Scott, 1981). The co-cultivation system has been shown to be a suitable method for the growth of field strain FCoVs, and particularly when combined with the RT-PCR assay will allow for the continued study of these viruses.",
