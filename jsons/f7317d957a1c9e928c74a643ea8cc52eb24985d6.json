            "text": "Episodes of acute rhinosinusitis are common among adults and are associated with a significant amount of morbidity. The symptoms of rhinosinusitis are nasal drainage, congestion, and sinus pressure. A bacterial sinus infection is more likely if these symptoms worsen after 5-7 days or do not improve after 10-14 days. The majority of bacterial episodes have been associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In the current era of increasing resistance to b-lactams and macrolides, treatment guidelines have been formulated worldwide to assist clinicians in the selection of antibacterials. According to one model, the following antibacterials are most likely to provide desired outcomes (90%-92% predicted clinical efficacy) for adults: respiratory fluoroquinolones (i.e., moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin), ceftriaxone, and highdose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g of amoxicillin/day and 250 mg of clavulanate/day). Although the role of the fluoroquinolones in the treatment of this condition is evolving, fluoroquinolones are often recommended as second-line therapy or as first-line therapy for selected patients (e.g., those who received antibacterials in the previous 4-6 weeks or adults with moderate-to-severe disease).",

Because sinusitis is generally preceded by rhinitis and rarely occurs without concurrent rhinitis, the more appropriate term for this condition is \"rhinosinusitis.\" Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time point after viral infection but is generally assumed to have occurred if symptoms have persisted for 110 days or have worsened after 5-7 days [2] .",

Most of these viral infections occur during the early fall to early spring, manifesting as a common cold, and the incidence of sinusitis is higher during this time [1] . Viral URTI stimulates increases in inflammation and in the local immune response of the nasopharynx and surrounding mucosa. Some viruses, such as influenza virus, produce significant mucosal damage.

Viruses have a suppressive effect on the function of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes [5] , including diminished adherent, chemotactic, phagocytic, oxidative, secretory, and bactericidal functions of neutrophils. Viruses also decrease the function of macrophages and lymphocytes, resulting in patients with viral URTIs being generally more vulnerable to secondary overgrowth and subsequent bacterial infection by pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Colonization with nontypeable H. influenzae is significantly affected by concurrent infection with RSV; however, the site of bacterial attachment is not known. The mechanism of attachment involves up-regulation of expression of epithelial cell-surface receptors, including CEA-CAM1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [5] .

[6] instilled S. pneumoniae during ongoing nasal allergic inflammation in a mouse model and found that allergy augments the infection and the resultant inflammatory response. They also showed that allergy alone or allergen exposure did not enhance the sinus infection, which suggests that local inflammation is important. The scientific basis for the role that allergy plays in ABRS includes the following theories: release of mediators from mast cells during an allergic reaction causes greater transudation of fluid and increased proliferation of bacteria in the sinus cavities; inflammatory mediators released by eosinophils during an allergic reaction expose epithelial S. pneumoniae binding sites; and ciliary transport from the sinuses altered by allergic inflammation reduces clearance of bacteria.",

Among S. pneumoniae isolates, the worldwide prevalence of resistance to penicillin (MIC, \u04432 mg/L) was 18.2%, and that of resistance to macrolides (erythromycin MIC, \u04431 mg/L) was 24.6%. In the United States, 37% of 2432 S. pneumoniae isolates demonstrated resistance to penicillin. The worldwide prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae (ofloxacin MIC, \u04438 mg/L) was low (1.1%) [12] . The prevalences of blactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates are 16.9% and 92.1%, respectively. In this surveillance study, both H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were highly susceptible to the tested fluoroquinolones (199.8%).",

Two studies have shown that moxifloxacin achieves high concentrations in sinus tissues [30] . Following the administration of single oral doses (400 mg) to 20 patients, Dinis et al. [30] found that moxifloxacin was distributed extensively throughout both inflamed and noninflamed sinus mucsoa, although concentrations were highest in the maxillary sinus. The tissue-to-blood ratios were 14:1 at most sites. In a second study, Gehanno et al. [31] measured moxifloxacin concentrations in sinus tissue after steady-state conditions (i.e., 400 mg/day for 5 days) had been reached in patients with chronic sinusitis. Concentrations of moxifloxacin in sinus mucosa were consistently higher than those in plasma: 4.56-5.73 mg/kg at 2-6 h after administration of a dose versus 1.25-2.81 mg/kg at 12-36 h after administration of a dose. The tissue:plasma ratio was 200%-328.9% (2-36 h after administration of a dose). Similar findings were found in other types of sinus tissue (e.g., maxillary sinus and anterior ethmoid sinus or nasal polyps). In both studies, sinus mucosal concentrations were well above MIC 90 values of moxifloxacin against a wide range of bacteria. In a study that used pharmacodynamic end points to evaluate gatifloxacin for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis, the median 24-h AUC for sinus aspirates and plasma samples was 1.51 (range, 0.88-2.23) [32] .",

Resistance to this pathogen occurs in 2 discrete steps, with spontaneous mutations occurring initially in parC and secondarily in gyrA [34] [35] [36] . Because there is increasing evidence that selection of resistant pneumococcal strains may vary among the respiratory fluoroquinolones, a new pharmacodynamic tool-the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) theory-has been developed. In brief, the MPC is the concentration required to inhibit the growth of the least susceptible wild-type mutants (i.e., single-step mutants), whereas the MIC is the lowest concentration needed to stop growth of wild-type bacteria [37] . Among a large number of clinical isolates of fluoroquinolone-susceptible S. pneumoniae ( ), moxifloxacin was found to be the fluoroquinn p 146 olone least likely to select for resistant mutants, followed by gatifloxacin and levofloxacin [38, 39] . Additional preliminary in vitro data suggest that AUC:MICs 1100 may protect against the selection of resistant S. pneumoniae mutants [40] .",

At the test-of-cure visit (7-14 days after therapy), clinical cure rates for patients who could be clinically evaluated were 74% for those given gatifloxacin for 5 days, 80% for those given gatifloxacin for 10 days, and 72% for those given amoxicillinclavulanate for 10 days. This study suggests that, for select patients with maxillary sinusitis, short-course gatifloxacin therapy is effective. Levofloxacin clinical trials. At least 2 comparative trials have established the effectiveness of levofloxacin for the treatment of adults with ABRS [49, 50] . In one trial, a total of 535 patients who could be clinically evaluated randomly received levofloxacin (500 mg/day) or amoxicillin-clavulanate (500 mg of amoxicillin t.i.d. and 125 mg of clavulanate t.i.d.) for 10-14 days [49] . Clinical cure/improvement rates, 2-5 days after therapy, were 88.4% for levofloxacin-treated patients, compared with 87.3% for amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients. In a second trial, 216 patients were randomized in double-blind fashion to receive therapy with either levofloxacin (500 mg/ day) or clarithromycin (500 mg b.i.d.) for 2 weeks [50] . Among 190 patients who could be evaluated, clinical cure/improvement rates were 96.0% for levofloxacin, compared with 93.3% for clarithromycin. At the follow-up evaluation 1 month after therapy, 4.1% of patients receiving levofloxacin and 7.2% receiving clarithromycin experienced a relapse of symptoms. Although these studies demonstrate the effectiveness of levofloxacin for ABRS, both of these studies were conducted almost 10 years ago, prior to the emergence of multidrug resistance in S. pneumoniae.

Collectively, treatment guidelines from North America and some countries in Europe reveal that amoxicillin and amoxicillinclavulanate are the most commonly recommended agents for the treatment of ABRS [5, 20] . Macrolides are the second most commonly used class globally, but national guidelines from the United States, France, and Spain recommend either no role or a limited role for macrolides, because of concerns about resistance in S. pneumoniae and because of their intrinsically poor activity against H. influenzae [5, 20] . The respiratory fluoroquinolones are positioned for use in patients with moderate or severe disease and those who have a history of recent antimicrobial use, when there is a failure to improve on the results of initial therapy after 72 h, and if there is an environment of antimicrobial resistance [5] .",
