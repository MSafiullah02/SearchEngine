Protein specificity of MAbs SA 87-A1 and SA 46-4 was first studied by Western blot analysis of Vero cell lysates infected with SARS-CoV. The results in Fig. 1 showed that MAbs SA87-A1 and SA46-4 reacted with N from infected cells and not with proteins from mock-infected cells. These MAbs reacted with a viral protein, which migrated as a doublet close to 50 kDa, the predicted size for the N protein. The presence of N in two forms was also shown by Western blotting using in vitro expressed N protein (data not shown). The presence of N in two forms may reflect a post-translational modification. This result is consistent with the results reported by Leung et al. 1 In their experiments, Western blots prepared using lysates from SARS-CoV infected cells probed with sera from patients showed several N protein-specific bands. They indicated that the N protein cleavage site is at the C-terminal, and this type of cleavage is specifically found in every preparation of the crude extracts. Post-translational cleavage of N would be a unique property of SARS-CoV, which is a subject of further study in our laboratory. To further define MAb specificity, IFA was performed on Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV Urbani strain. The cells were fixed and incubated with MAbs SA87-A1 and SA46-4, and then double stained with AlexaFluor 594 (Molecular Probes) conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and a nuclear stain ToPro-3 (Molecular Probes). As shown in Fig. 2 , both MAbs SA46-4 and SA87-A1 specifically recognized the viral N protein, which is accumulated in the cytoplasm, in contrast with the ToPro-3 nuclear staining.",

Especially, because previous studies demonstrated that N protein detection exhibited a high positive rate between day 3 and day 5 after the onset of symptoms, these anti-N MAbs will be suitable reagents for early detection of SARS-CoV infection. 5 Furthermore, the N protein has been determined to be the most antigenic structural protein, expressed in high abundance in infected cells, and N protein sequences are relatively conserved among different strains of SARS-CoV. 1, 4, 6 These MAbs may have a substantial impact on the development of diagnostic tests for SARS.",
