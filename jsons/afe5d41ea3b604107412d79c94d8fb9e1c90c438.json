A freak exception to the immunity of natural catastrophe bonds against volatility in the financial markets arose following the sudden collapse of Lehman Brothers during the financial crash of 2007.

The metric for impact includes not just loss inflicted but also the media attention gained. An insightful ISIS slogan is that media is half Jihad.

Given two weapons of similar effectiveness and reliability, the weapon that is easiest and least expensive in resources to procure is likely to be used.

Technically, they are complex to manufacture in a reliable and secure way, and buying them on the black market runs the risk of all illicit markets: the problem of lemons.

Insurance accumulation risk in an urban area may be gauged from a loss analysis using a five-ton bomb scenario. But how likely is such a weapon mode? Attack severity is constrained by the logistical burden of acquiring the skilled personnel, material, testing facilities and financial resources required for a weapon attack mode: the bigger and more ambitious the weapon, the greater is the logistical burden. Most importantly in a hostile counter-terrorism environment, attack severity is limited by the persistent and pervasive threat of arrest and plot disruption. Once a weapon of a particular size has been developed, an expedient terrorist choice would be to deploy it without delay. Alternatively, a riskier decision may be made to continue to develop a larger more potent weapon, which would pose a greater logistical challenge and would require extra material and financial resources, more time and more operatives.

In an oppressive counterterrorism environment, it is hard and perhaps foolhardy for a terrorist organization to skip weapon sizes because the extra development and testing time for a new superior weapon would present an excessive risk of interdiction or malfunction.

Before any massive CBRN attack, some precursory lesser attack may provide an early warning indicator of increasing terrorist capability and progression on the demanding technical learning curve. As the anthrax letter scare in Autumn 2001 demonstrated, even a small quantity of anthrax can cause mass terror. If a terrorist cell has accumulated even a modest quantity of a highly toxic substance, there would be very strong counterterrorism pressure to deploy it rather than to delay an attack by months to acquire much more. The law of diminishing returns would apply to the prospective terrorist gain. Operational research methods can quantify the balance between the risk of arrest and the reward of a more potent weapon. Since 9/11, denial of safe terrorist havens for laboratory R&D has meant that not even a minor Jihadi CBRN attack has been witnessed, and there is scant evidence of experimentation and preparation of toxic material. In Syria, chlorine bombs have been deployed, but these lack the lethal potency of nerve agents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Severity of Weapon Attack Modes"}, {"text": "Amongst the foremost concerns widely expressed about terrorism risk assessment is over the estimation of the annual frequency of the class of macroterror attacks, defined as those which cause significant economic loss in excess of $1 billion, numerous casualties in excess of 50 fatalities, or harm to iconic national targets. This frequency is tightly constrained by counter-terrorism action, specifically mass electronic surveillance. Spectacular macro-terror attacks require diligent planning, reconnaissance and attack preparation, and a number of trained operatives; the more ambitious and extensive a terrorist plot is, the more operatives are needed. No person lives in complete isolation. Every human being has his or her own social network, and terrorists need emotional, religious and operational support and encouragement from theirs. Social networks are amenable to a substantial degree of analytical characterization, providing a sufficient window on terrorist cell contacts for most plots to be interdicted. The various links between members of a social network provide key insight into the involvement of an individual in a terrorist plot. The singular achievement of the Western security services in interdicting the vast majority of significant plots since 9/11 is evidence of their command of terrorist communications networks, in particular monitoring electronic meta-data on who is contacting whom.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Frequency of Terrorist Attacks"}, {"text": "For terrorism frequency analysis in the Western alliance, the basic metric is not the number of successful macro-terror attacks, of which there are very few, but the number of plots, of which there are far more.

The tragically common US occurrence of lone-wolf shooters suggests that the interdiction rate could not be maintained at a higher level than this without a great deal of luck. Less methodically, more interdictions may occur through lucky tip-offs or random searches, or through the deliberate entrapment of terrorists. The latter has been a popular if controversial FBI tactic; civil libertarians may question whether sting operations would ultimately lead to real attacks without external assistance. A conservative and robust approach to frequency modelling involves simulating plot sequences with interdiction rates based on counter-terrorism surveillance leading to courtroom terrorism convictions, but without any additional supplement to the interdiction rates to account for lucky or contrived interdictions. The Five Eyes Alliance is the foremost international intelligence gathering collective. It comprises the five English-speaking countries: UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Recognizing the tight surveillance in the Five Eyes Alliance, terrorism insurance in these countries is effectively insurance against the failure of counter-terrorism. No terrorism insurance loss can occur without a gross breach of security and intelligence failure, which are the responsibility of the state. It is salutary for insurers to reflect that the prime impact from a terrorist attack is not the insurance loss, but the casualties, economic damage, national and international political repercussions, and of course public fear and apprehension. Such are the serious societal consequences that as the principal stakeholders in security, Western governments have been committed to spending heavily on counter-terrorism, even during times of economic austerity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Frequency of Terrorist Attacks"}, {"text": "Terrorism is a man-made rather than natural hazard. This is generally perceived to be a negative and destabilizing characteristic for insurance purposes. However, because terrorist plots are conceived by human beings, they can be (and usually are) thwarted in a way that hurricanes and other hazards of Nature cannot. In 2004, when four hurricanes struck Florida, Governor Jeb Bush was powerless to stop their repeated landfall in his state. Unlike hurricane risk, terrorism is a control process: as and when the threat is raised, the counter-terrorism response is also raised. Also, as and when terrorist attacks do occur, the forces of counter-terrorism react promptly to suppress the likelihood of further attacks. This response has happened after each of the notable successful attacks against the Western alliance since 9/11. When Michael Chertoff was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security in February 2005, President Bush instructed him not to let 9/11 happen again. He did not. Following this instruction, Secretary Chertoff kept a clean terrorism sheet for his entire four-year term of office-but Hurricane Katrina struck catastrophically in August 2005. Al Qaeda commented with schadenfreude that the hurricane had joined the Jihad.

In many countries of the world, where the law enforcement and security services are ineffective or corrupt, terrorists are allowed to attack at will, and terrorism risk is then very dependent on human behaviour.

This remains to be seen. If a terrorism act is certified, insurers are eligible for payments under the Program. These depend on multiple factors, including the Program Trigger, individual insurer deductibles, the Federal share of compensation, and the Program Cap. The Program Trigger is the amount of aggregate industry insured losses that must be exceeded before any Federal payments are made. The Program Trigger was $120 million in calendar year 2016; increasing by $20 million per year thereafter until $200 million in 2020.
