A C18 column is used with a mobile phase consisting of either methanol or acetonitrile as organic component along with an aqueous phase containing either an acid modifier like acetic acid or phosphoric acid.[23\u201336] GA being a triterpinesaponin, its content in the plant tissue varies significantly at different time periods of the year. Thus a proper quantification of the same in the marketed polyherbal preparation is essential. In our study we have developed a simple, rapid and sensitive method for the estimation of GA from a polyherbal preparation containing extract of Glycyrrhizaglabra. We have used LC- DAD method for quantification and LC MS-MS system with gradient elution for identity confirmation. The earlier methods[37\u201339] are much more tedious and time consuming compared to the newly developed method which is rapid and reproducible and has been validated as per ICH guidelines.[40]",

To ensure reliability and accuracy of the proposed method, recovery studies were carried out by mixing a known quantity of the standard drug with the sample at three different concentration levels (10, 20 and 30% above assay value labeled as A, B and C). Six injections of the standard solutions were done to study the precision of the method. The linearity of the method was established by triplicate injections of standard solution in the concentration range of 12.4 to124 \u03bcg/ml. The intra-day precision was calculated using six injections at the higher concentration range (124 \u03bcg/ml) on the same day. These studies were repeated with solutions of different concentration on different days to obtain the inter-day precision. The specificity of the method was studied from purity plot of PDA detector. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) were determined by injecting progressively low concentrations of standard solution under optimized chromatographic conditions.[41] Ruggedness of the method was studied by carrying out experiment on instruments of different make. The robustness of the method was determined by making slight changes in chromatographic conditions like composition (\u00b15%) and pH (\u00b10.1%) of mobile phase.",
