A recent study using a non-immune human scFv library [16 ] has clearly shown that phage vectors allow higher display levels and make biopanning more efficient (i.e. greater numbers of binders are isolated in fewer rounds). The reason for these differences stems from the need for a helper phage (e.g. VCS-M13 or M13KO7) for rescue of phagemid vectors ( Figure 2 ). Wild-type pIII, encoded by the helper phage, is packaged more efficiently than scFv-pIII fusions encoded by phagemids. As a result, phagemid virions contain none or a single copy of the scFv-pIII hybrid, whereas several copies can be packaged in phage virions.",

The pIII mutant helper phages produce multivalent phagemid particles that can be used for the initial round of biopanning, whereas rescue with standard helper phages produces monovalent (highaffinity) particles for the following rounds [22 ] . Two improved mutant helper phages with partial deletions or amber stop codons in gene 3 have been reported (Hyperphage and Phaberge) [17 ,22 ] . Compared with other M13-pIII mutants [23, 24] , the new helpers appear to be more stable and produce higher titers of rescued phagemids. These mutant helper phages can also be extremely useful for the selective infection of phage (SIP) [25] . SIP phagemid vectors contain an N-terminal truncation of pIII that produces non-infective particles unless the displayed rAbs or Afs interact with the desired antigen (provided in trans and fused to the N-terminal domain of pIII) [26] . The selection of specific rAb and Af binders using phage display. Gene libraries of rAbs or Afs, cloned in phage or phagemid vectors, can be rescued in phage particles displaying the corresponding rAb or Af on their capsids. This allows the specific binding of phage particles displaying rAb and Af binders to a given immobilized antigen, for example, on a solid surface (other strategies have also been developed [77] ). Elution of bound phages, and their amplification by re-infecting E. coli cells, permits their clonal expansion. After a few rounds of panning (including phage binding, elution and amplification), the binding activity of individual clones can be screened by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on microtiter plates.",

As oxidized scFvs seem to refold in vitro with higher efficiency [44 ], these strains may also be useful for the refolding of scFvs from Targeting of functional rAbs to various E. coli compartments. rAbs (illustrated here as an scFv molecule for simplicity) can be expressed in E. coli using the classical Sec pathway that targets the protein to the periplasmic space. Periplasmic chaperones (e.g. DsbA and FkpA) fold the Ig domains or rAbs using this expression strategy. When fused to a C-terminal autotransporter domain (AT), these rAbs can be redirected to the outer membrane (OM) and become exposed at the surface of the bacteria. Alternatively, rAbs devoid of Sec signal peptides can be expressed in a functional form in the cytoplasm of E. coli trxB gor mutant strains. Cytoplasmic co-expression of signal sequence-less (Dss) derivatives of periplasmic chaperones (e.g. DsbC or Skp) assist in many cases the folding of the cytoplasmic rAbs. In addition, rAbs can be secreted toward the extracellular medium, directly from the cytoplasm, by fusion with a C-terminal secretion signal from E. coli a-hemolysin (HlyA) and its type I transporter (TolC-HlyB-HlyD) . See text for details. IM, inner membrane. inclusion bodies. Functional (correctly folded and oxidized) and soluble Fab and scFv molecules have been produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli cells carrying mutations in the genes coding for thiorredoxin reductase (trxB) and glutathione oxidoreductase (gor), with yields similar or even higher than those obtained in the periplasm [37 ,45 ,46 ]. E. coli trxB gor mutant cells have an oxidizing cytoplasm capable of forming disulfide bridges in proteins [47, 48] . At induction temperatures above 308C efficient folding of Fabs and scFvs in E. coli trxB gor mutants appears to require cytoplasmic co-expression of the periplasmic chaperones DsbC or Skp (devoid of their N-terminal signal peptides) [37 ,45 ] . Interestingly, in vivo biotinylation of an scFv expressed in the absence of chaperones in the cytoplasm of E. coli trxB gor cells was only efficient at temperatures below 308C [49 ] . Biotinylated rAbs can be bound to avidin-and streptavidincontaining resins (e.g. streptavidin magnetic beads) and immunoconjugates (e.g. streptavidin-peroxidase) for purification, immunoprecipitation and detection purposes.",

Alternatively, shortening the length of the linker peptide connecting the V H -V L domains in scFvs generates diabodies (scFv dimers), triabodies and tetrabodies, with mono-bi-tri-or tetra-antigen specificities (reviewed in [57] ). Bivalent dimeric and bi-specific camel sdAbs have also been produced by fusing two V HH domains with a natural hinge peptide [58] .

Therefore, current studies are focusing on the major factors influencing their stability and expression [59, 60] , while others search for new methodologies to produce oligomeric rAbs of high-avidity. For instance, novel 'di-diabody' molecules of high stability have been obtained in the periplasm by the interaction of two bi-specific diabody molecules with the constant C H 3 domain from a natural IgG [61] . Stable dimers of V HH have been secreted to the supernatants of E. coli cultures using a modified HlyA signal containing the leucine zipper of GCN4 [52 ] . Another report used the B subunit of the Verotoxin 1 (VT1B), a Shiga-like A:B 5 toxin from E. coli O157:H7, to assemble stable and soluble pentamers of sdAb with high avidity in the periplasm [39, 62 ] . The sdAb molecules were derived from a na\u00efve llama V HH library and the small VT1B monomer (7.7 kDa) was fused to the N termini of the sdAbs, which did not interfere with their binding properties. A novel multimerization system, based on the interaction between the prokaryotic ribonuclease Barnase (110 amino acids) and its inhibitor Barstar (89 amino acids), has revealed important advantages [44 ] . Barnase and Barstar interact with extremely high affinity (K D $10 \u00c014 M), thus making complexes of remarkable stability. These polypeptides are soluble, fold independently of its interacting pair, and can be secreted to the periplasm. Fusing these proteins to the C terminus of scFvs has allowed the production of stable mono-di-and trivalent complexes of high avidity and with long half-lives in vivo. Of specific note using this approach, homogeneous bi-specific dimers can be produced in vitro during the process of large-scale protein purification by in-column refolding.",

            "text": "Two Af libraries have been constructed based on ankyrin repeats (AnkR) as protein scaffolds [69 ,70] . AnkR proteins are composed of several 33 amino acid repeats stacked in a row, each repeat comprising a b-turn followed by two antiparallel a helices and a C-terminal loop [71] . The AnkR proteins are found in organisms from all phyla and can be located in the cytoplasm, anchored to membranes or secreted to the extracellular space. The strategy to generate the AnkR Af libraries was based on the design of a synthetic AnkR consensus sequence, derived from natural AnkR sequences, with randomized amino acid positions at the b-turn and the short hinge connecting the two a helices. This AnkR module was repeated two or three times, depending on the specific library, and the fusion proteins were flanked at their N and C termini with capping AnkR of defined sequence [69 ] . The AnkR Afs were highly stable, soluble and accumulated in the cytoplasm of E. coli at high concentrations (yields averaged 200 mg/L of culture in shake flasks). More importantly, high-affinity binders (K D in the nanomolar range) against different protein targets (e.g. MBP) were selected from these libraries using ribosomal display (a powerful technique for the selection of binders directly from an in vitro transcription-translation reaction [72, 73] ). The same report also showed a co-crystal of MBP with its binder AnkR Af, revealing the interaction surface between these two molecules. The three-dimensional X-ray structure of the MBP-Af complex showed the randomized amino acids of the AnkRs forming a concave surface contacting MBP and covering $600 \u00c5 2 of its surface, which is only slightly smaller than the surface covered in antigen-antibody complexes (777 AE 135 \u00c5 2 ) [74] . Given the extraordinary properties of AnkR Afs (e.g. high solubility, affinity, flexible modularity, absence of disulfide bonds, etc.), these Afs may be suited not only for in vitro applications (e.g. affinity purification, protein co-crystallization and protein chips), but might also have a role as intracellular inhibitors of specific processes in vivo.",
