This study aimed to determine whether non-replicating FMDV could induce apoptosis of the host immune cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that bone morrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were induced to undergo apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, which was determined by the annexin-V staining, DNA fragmentation, and TUNEL staining methods, after they were treated with the chemically inactivated FMDV in vitro. The initiation of apoptosis was apparently via an interaction of the integrin receptor on BMDCs and the RGD motif within the VP1 capsid protein of FMDV. The initiation activated a cascade of apoptotic pathway including reduced expression of Bcl-2, activation of caspases, and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Pretreatment with BMDCs with LPS prevented the inactivated FMDV induced apoptosis, suggesting immature BMDCs are susceptible to such apoptosis. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the inactivated FMDV induces the apoptosis in BMDCs via the integrin receptor and subsequently triggers the apoptosis signal, suggesting that such induction of apoptosis is likely to impair immune responses against FMDV infection.",

Acute infection of FMDV causes young animals to die, abortions of pregnant ones, and extensive lesions in mouth and feet. During acute phase the FMDV infection, a marked transient lymphopenia occurs and affects all of the lymph cell subsets, CD4 \u00fe , and CD8 \u00fe , during 2-3 days after the infection [Bautista et al., 2003; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2006] , suggesting an interaction of the FMDV with the host immune cells. Such remarkable changes in immune system have been also seen in other viral pathogens including classical swine fever virus (CSFV) [Susa et al., 1992; Summerfield et al., 2001] , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [Moses et al., 1998] , influenza virus [Lewis et al., 1986] , etc. One reason for the lymphopenia during the acute infection is due to virusinduced apoptosis. Lymphocytes, including the T cells, B cells and antigen presenting cell (APC), are usually targets of viral infection to evade host immune responses.",

For instance, induction of DC apoptosis by HIV, CSFV, and Influenza virus leads to the retardation of immune system [Hinshaw et al., 1994; Shi et al., 1996; Summerfield et al., 1998; Gougeon, 2003; Stasakova et al., 2005] , which creates a window period for viral replications and propagations that leads to an immune suppression. The viral induced apoptosis can occur before and after the virus entry. Induction of apoptosis before viral entry has been reported for primary cells or cell lines exposed to type 3 reovirus [Tyler et al., 1995] , avian leukosis virus [Brojatsch et al., 1996] , bovine herpesvirus 1 [Hanon et al., 1998] , vaccinia virus [Ramsey-Ewing and Moss, 1998 ], sindbis virus [Jan and Griffin, 1999] , and murine coronavirus [Liu et al., 2003] . Ostrowski et al. [2005] recently demonstrated that FMDV can infect murine DCs in vitro and subsequently suppress thymus-dependent immune responses in vivo. However, whether this interaction of FMDV and DC induces the DC to undergo an apoptosis in turns to lead the observed immune suppression has not been investigated.",

As shown in Figure 5A , addition of a broadspectrum caspase inhibitor (z-VAD.fmk) significantly blocked the apoptosis. Similarly, the inhibitors of caspase-3, 8, and 9 have been shown to partially blocke the apoptosis Figure 5B . Inhibitions of caspase 8 is suggesting that apoptosis in BMDCs induced by the inactivated FMDV is partially mediated by caspase 8. The inhibitions of caspases 3 and 9 are suggesting that the downstream of the apoptosis signaling cascade are activated and the apoptosis process is irreversible. In contrast, the caspase-1 inhibitor was totally unable Fig. 4 . The induction of apoptosis by the inactivated FMDV to BMDCs is mediated by mitochondria signaling. A: Proteins were extracted from the BMDCs after treated with the inactivated FMDV or HBsAg as the negative control at different times, and subjected into SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis by anti-BCL2, anti-Bax, and anti-Bcl-XL specific antibodies.

We also showed that the difference on the inhibitions of apoptosis induced by these three caspaseinhibitors, which may be caused by their different roles on the apoptosis induction. In general, caspase-3 functioned as the irreversible inducer of the apoptosis [Cohen, 1997] ; caspapse-9 is mainly observed to a critical apoptotic stimulus through the mitochondrial dysfunction [Kuida et al., 1998 ]. However, the caspase-8 is observed to regulate both mitochondrial and the death receptor pathways [Varfolomeev et al., 1998; Chandra et al., 2004] . So that we showed in Figure 5B that the inhibitors for caspase-8 or -9 could only partially block the apoptosis induced by killed FMDV, however the inhibitor for caspase-3 could block the apoptosis twofold over the inhibition obtained from the caspase-8 or caspase-9, suggesting that the killed FMDV may activate the apoptosis of BMDC by caspase-8 or caspase-9 first and subsequently activate the caspase-3 to become the irreversible phase.",

In this study, we showed that LPS induced maturation of BMDCs exhibited a resistance to the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 6B,C) . This is further supported by the rapamycin treatment experiment since the rapamycin downregulates the endocytosis and promotes the maturation of BMDCs (Fig. 3B) . These results suggest that the resistance to the apoptosis induced by the inactivated FMDV may be due to matured BMDCs losing the endocytosis ability during their maturation.",

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that a marked immuno-pathogenesis and lymphopenia has been associated with acute viral infections caused by viruses including the HIV-1 [Moses et al., 1998] , measles virus [Okada et al., 2000] , CSFV [Susa et al., 1992] , and FMDV [Bautista et al., 2003; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2006 ]. In the case of FMDV, the induction of transient lymphopenia during acute phase infection affects all subpopulations of lymphocytes, such as CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe , during 2-3 days after infection [Bautista et al., 2003] . One reason for the lymphopenia during the acute infection is of a viral induced apoptosis. A depletion of lymphocytes due to apoptosis has also been described in mice infected with a highly virulent influenza A virus (AIV, H5N1) isolated from humans [Tumpey et al., 2000] . Peng et al. [2004] has demonstrated recently that the recombinant VP1 of FMDV could induce the apoptosis of human cancer cells by modulating the Akt signaling pathway. However, no association of lymphocytes apoptosis is investigated. Ostrowski et al. [2005] , recently demonstrated that FMDV can infect murine DCs in vitro and subsequently suppress thymus-dependent immune responses in vivo. This interaction of FMDV and DC may induce the DC to undergo an apoptosis. Here, we described for the first time that the FMDV induces a rapid apoptosis in murine bone morrow derived DC (BMDC) before its infection. Since DCs play a crucial role in connection innate and adaptive immune responses, FMDV destroys the DC or affects DC functions, including downregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, inhibition of cytokine secretion, and maturation and its presentation ability (data not shown), which could lead the host immune system impairment. Although, we have not investigated that the induction of apoptosis in DCs occur after FMDV infection in animals during its acute phase, our results clearly demonstrated that the inactivated FMDV induced immature BMDCs undergone apoptosis rapidly, which may reveal one of the important strategies to knockdown the immune surveillance before the FMDV invades into host cells.",
