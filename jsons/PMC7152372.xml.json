The dissemination of infectious agents with the purpose of attacking livestock and agricultural resources has similar motives. Many of the agents that could potentially be used in bioterror (BT) attacks are also responsible for naturally occurring infectious diseases in the tropics. As such, naturally occurring outbreaks must be differentiated from BT attacks for public health, forensic, and security reasons. If a BT attack occurs in tropical underdeveloped countries, owing to their weak public health infrastructure, the public health implications would be even more dramatic than in developed countries. An outbreak of smallpox due to a BT attack would probably require vaccination and mandatory quarantine of millions of people in order to control the outbreak and quell global public unrest. This chapter will concentrate on selected infectious agents that have the potential to be used as bioterror agents in human populations.",

As in most emerging infections, we predict that in bioterrorist attacks the etiological diagnosis will be made by a clinician or pathologist and the recognition of a bioterrorist event will be through geographical and epidemiological anomalies. We have very limited environmental detection capability at this time, and there are no comprehensive point-of-care diagnostics for most of the high-impact BT agents. Some diseases such as inhalational anthrax or smallpox may be relatively readily recognized by an alert clinician because of their very distinctive presentation in many cases. However, the leading edge of a BT epidemic may arrive on a pathologist's doorstep without prior suspicion. For example, individual cases of pneumonic plague as the earliest harbingers of an attack will presumably present as community-acquired pneumonia and probably die without clinical diagnosis. Given the short window available for successful treatment, the recognition of these earliest cases is paramount. Sartwell1 has demonstrated empirically that incubation periods follow a log-normal distribution, which results in \u201cfront-loading\u201d of cases (Fig. 119-1\n). Delay in recognizing the epidemic through reliance on syndromic surveillance or other surrogates will likely result in most of the cases of diseases such as plague and tularemia being well into their disease course and perhaps unsalvageable.2\n",

Indeed, the extension of the risk population to include children, the elderly, and the immunosuppressed is likely to provide considerable insight into these often-understudied groups. It is also likely that our lack of information about them will challenge our current diagnostic algorithms.",

Ever since the times of the ancient Greeks and Romans, humans have tried to inflict damage by the use of contagion on other populations.6,\n7 Less than 4% of the people or groups responsible for terrorist attacks on human populations take responsibility for their actions.8 Therefore, the use of biological weapons is ideal to conduct covert attacks. In addition, it has been estimated that to kill the same number of human beings with biological weapons as compared to chemical or nuclear weapons, the cost is far less with biological weapons ($2/human casualty) compared with chemical ($2000/human casualty) and nuclear ($2,000,000/human casualty) weapons.6 Hypothetical BT attacks would range from an overt attack of a large city with a bomb containing several kilograms of an agent (weaponized bacteria, viruses, or toxins) to discrete or covert intentional release of the infectious agent through a delivery system, such as spray devices, postal service, ventilation ducts, water supplies, and food supply.",

Therefore, the first challenge is to identify the infectious agent responsible for a certain disease correctly, followed by a thorough epidemiologic and microbiologic analysis of the epidemic or outbreak. In some circumstances, the identification of a BT attack would be obvious. A case of smallpox in any human population is an international emergency that would trigger a massive response of the public health systems around the world. Sophisticated epidemiological investigations would follow in order to characterize the outbreak, identify the source, and possibly label it \u201cintentional.\u201d In other cases, the identification of the outbreak as secondary to intentional dissemination of an infectious agent will require the use of sophisticated epidemiological and molecular tools, especially for diseases endemic to the area where the outbreak occurs. The need to use genetic sequences as markers has spawned a new discipline referred to as microbial forensics, sister to phylogenetics and \u201cmolecular epidemiology.\u201d",

They include presence of disease outbreaks of the same illness in noncontiguous areas, disease outbreaks with zoonotic impact, different attack rates in different environments (indoor versus outdoor), presence of large epidemics in small populations, increased number of unexplained deaths, unusually high severity of a disease for a particular pathogen, unusual clinical manifestations owing to route of transmission for a given pathogen, presence of a disease (vector-borne or not) in an area not endemic for that particular disease, multiple epidemics with different diseases in the same population, a case of a disease by an uncommon agent (smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fevers, inhalational anthrax), unusual strains of microorganisms when compared to conventional strains circulating in the same affected areas, and genetically homogenous organisms isolated from different locations.9,\n10 These are a few guidelines that could prove helpful when investigating an outbreak, but it has to be kept in mind that the deduction will not be based on any single finding but rather the pattern seen in its totality. First and foremost, the possibility of an attack must be ever in mind, or differentiation of a covert BT attack and a natural outbreak of an infectious disease may not be made. In fact, the outbreak of salmonellosis in Oregon in 1984 was due to a covert attack planned by the Rajneeshee leadership and accompanied by distinctive epidemiological clues. It was not labeled as intentional until somebody came forward with the information leading to the responsible group; as in most of medicine, the unsuspected diagnosis is the easiest to miss.11\n",

This new method of surveillance is based on syndromic disease rates such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological syndromes or analysis of other health-related activities such as laboratory test requests and results, purchasing rates for certain pharmaceutical agents, unexplained death rates, and veterinary surveillance.2,\n10,\n11 The purpose of syndromic surveillance is to detect a BT attack as early as possible by analyzing the previously mentioned variables by extracting and analyzing data through computer networks. The rationale behind syndromic surveillance is the nonspecific nature of early signs and symptoms of many of the illnesses caused by BT agents. Examples of proposed syndromes are as follows: gastroenteritis of any apparent infectious etiology, pneumonia with the sudden death of a previously healthy adult, widened mediastinum in a febrile patient, acute neurologic illness with fever, and advancing cranial nerve impairment with weakness.12 A key component of this system is the continuous analysis of health-care variables to establish thresholds for all variables being analyzed. It is worth mentioning that one of the first flags raised by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic in its early stages in the United States was the increased number of orders for pentamidine from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to treat several patients in California for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. As of May 2003, syndromic surveillance systems had been established in approximately 100 sites. One of the best known systems is the so-called Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE II) being developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Biophysics Laboratory.12 This project is sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for use in the Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections System. The first system developed (ESSENCE I) is already in use at all U.S. military treatment facilities.12 ESSENCE II uses the following syndromes for analysis: respiratory, gastrointestinal, fever, dermatological hemorrhagic, dermatological infectious, neurological, and coma.",

Other variables are included in the analysis, such as time and place, and an epidemiological curve can be constructed.10 Epidemiological curves are an important tool to analyze epidemics and suggest the mode of transmission and propagation. A point source epidemic curve is classically log-normal in distribution1 and would suggest a common exposure of a population to an infectious agent. Of course, there can be variations depending on the presence of susceptible subpopulations (e.g., children, immunosuppressed, aged) and on varying doses of the agent. Propagative curves are more characteristic of highly communicable agents such as smallpox.",

These symptoms are followed in 3 to 4 days by an abrupt onset of respi-ratory insufficiency, stridor, diaphoresis, and cyanosis. The subsequent clinical course is rapid, and patients usually die within 24 to 36 hours after clinical deterioration.

However, many patients also developed hematogenous hemorrhagic pneumonia. Pleural effusions were usually large and frequently led to severe lung atelectasis.

Vectors are also numerous and include ticks, fleas, mosquitoes, and biting flies.37,\n38 This is an impressive range for any human pathogen.",

In natural infections, both ulceroglandular and typhoidal forms can have a hematogenous pulmonary component, although it is more common in typhoidal forms. Pulmonary features include cough, pleural effusions, and multifocal bronchopneumonic infiltrates.

Smallpox (see Chapter 58) is the only disease so far eradicated from the face of the earth due to human intervention. The WHO declared smallpox eradicated in 1980 after the last case of natural disease was diagnosed in Somalia in 1977,42 and vaccination ceased around the world, rendering humankind vulnerable to reintroduction of the virus.43, 44, 45 A laboratory accident was responsible for two more cases in 1978 in England. This accident prompted the WHO to restrict the frozen virus to two places in the world: the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Institute for Polyomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides in Moscow, later moved to NPO VECTOR, Novosibirisk, Russia. However, it is suspected that secret military repositories exist after the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and the subsequent exodus of scientists involved in its bioweapons program (Biopreparat).46,\n47 The agent responsible for this disease is an orthopox virus with no known animal reservoir, but high aerosol infectivity, stability, and mortality. Although not a category A agent, monkeypox is responsible for outbreaks in Africa and is the only other member of the orthopox genus capable of producing systemic disease in humans. The clinical disease is potentially indistinguishable from smallpox, where mortality rates in tropical Africa are around 10% to 15%. In May and June 2003, an outbreak of monkeypox occurred in the United States.48 Thirty-seven infections were laboratory-documented and involved humans exposed to infected prairie dogs that had become infected because of contact with infected Gambian rats and dormice, two animal species shipped from Africa earlier that year. Infected humans included veterinarians, exotic pet dealers, and pet owners. The clinical spectrum in this outbreak ranged from asymptomatic seroconversions to febrile illness with papulovesicular rash. No deaths were associated with this outbreak. However, phylogenetic analysis of the virus placed it in the West Africa clade as opposed to the Central Africa clade which carries the previously mentioned case-fatality rate of 10% to 15%.",

The initial phase is nonspecific, common to other viral syndromes, and is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, fatigue, malaise, and headaches. During this prodromal phase in 10% of patients with fair complexion, a discrete erythematous rash appears on the face, forearms, and hands. The typical smallpox rash has a centrifugal distribution (that is, more abundant on the face and extremities than on the trunk and abdomen). An enanthem also develops with presence of oral ulcerations by the time the exanthem appears. Systemic manisfestations begin to subside once the rash appears and can reappear with superinfection of skin lesions or superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. Progression of the lesions is synchronous (maculopapules, vesicles, pustules). After pustules rupture, scabs form and detach in 2 to 3 weeks, leaving depigmented, scarred areas. This form of the disease, called variola major, is fatal in up to 30% of unvaccinated patients and 3% of vaccinated individuals. Various hemorrhagic forms exist. In some cases, the rash progresses very slowly and hemorrhage develops into the base of the lesions, which remain flat and soft instead of tense, carrying a bad prognosis. In some other cases, the disease is hemorrhagic from the beginning, leading to death 5 to 7 days after the initial symptoms appear (case-fatality rate: 100%). Finally, in some cases, a severe and overwhelming illness is followed by dusky skin lesions; these patients have a large quantity of virus and are extremely dangerous epidemiologically. Previously vaccinated individuals usually develop a milder disease that consists of a mild pre-eruptive phase followed by few skin lesions that appear more superficial, evolve more rapidly, and are not as synchronous as the classical type.50\n",

Large outbreaks of the disease still occur in tropical regions around the world in areas stricken by war, famine, and poverty. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), on the other hand, is transmitted by tick bites and occurs endemically in South and Central America as well as North America. Rickettsiae target the microvascular endothelium leading to leaky capillaries systemically.67 The main causes of morbidity and mortality are noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and cerebral edema leading to diffuse alveolar damage and meningoencephalitis. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific and include fever, malaise, headache, myalgias/arthralgias, cough, nausea, vomiting, confusion, stupor, and coma in severe cases. Skin rash ranges from maculopapular to petechial, depending on the severity, and is observed in around 90% of patients with RMSF and 2% to 100% of cases of epidemic typhus, depending on the darkness of cutaneous pigmentation. Rickettsiae are remarkably underestimated biothreats as they are highly infectious by low-dose aerosol exposure, possess a stable extracellular form, and are resistant to most empirically administered antibiotics, including \u03b2-lactams, aminoglycosides, and macrolides, and are exacerbated by sulfonamides. Case-fatality rates can be as high as 40% to 50% without antibiotic therapy and 3% to 5% with adequate antibiotic coverage. Lethal cases are usually due to delayed diagnosis.64,\n65,\n68\n",

However, the use of the toxin in small BT attacks is possible in the tropics because of its ready availability and relatively easy extraction from the beans. Clinical presentation depends on the route of administration as does the LD50. In cases where large amounts of the toxin are ingested, the manifestations include nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal cramping, rectal hemorrhage, and diarrhea. As the clinical course progresses, anuria, mydriasis, severe headaches, and shock supervene leading to the patient's demise in 2 to 3 days. Clinical manifestations usually appear within 10 hours after ingestion of the toxin. Inhalational exposure leads to prominent pulmonary manifestations 8 to 28 hours after exposure and fever, dyspnea, progressive cough, cyanosis, and death. Histologically, there is widespread necrosis of pulmonary parenchyma and pulmonary edema. A single case of parenteral intoxication was documented.

The importance of these diagnostic techniques in a disease such as plague is evident. The log-normal epidemic curve with a narrow dispersion of the incubation periods (see Fig. 119-1) and the short interval for successful antibiotic therapy mandate recognition of the earliest cases if the bulk of the exposed are to be saved.
