Important figures in the human history, such as Pharaoh Tutankhamun and his family (1324 BC), Saint Augustine (579 BC), Dante Alighieri (1321 AD), and Charles V of the Holy Roman Germanic Empire (1558 AD), were affected by severe intermittent fevers (Celli 1925; Bruce-Chwatt 1988; Hawass et al. 2010; Fiocruz 2017).",

            "text": "The great navigations and the consequent territorial conquests were the perfect opportunity for malaria to spread to other regions of the planet, being considered one of the most devastating diseases of North American colonies between the XVI and the XVIII centuries (Duffy 1953; Ackerknecht 1966; Russell 1968). At the XVIII century, Italians thought that the symptoms of intermittent fever were due to unhealthy air\u2014\u201cmal aire\u201d\u2014and that expression gave rise to the current name of the disease, malaria. In South America, this disease arrived through the ships that brought the slaves to work mainly in Brazil (Yalcindag et al. 2012). At the XVII century, as the mortality increased, South American, Indians, and Jesuit priests started using teas and beverages prepared with Cinchona sp. as treatment (Lee 2002; Ockenhouse et al. 2005). In 1820, Pierre Pelletier and Joseph Caventau isolated quinine from Cinchona sp., proved its antimalarial effect, and in the next year, quinine and quinine sulfate were commercially available as the first antimalarial drugs (Cunico et al. 2008). Despite the discovery of an effective active principle, it took some decades to elucidate the causes of malaria. It was in 1880 that the French physician Charles Alphonse Laveran observed the malaria-causing protozoa in red blood cells of one of his patients. Between 1897 and 1899, Italian researchers Amico Bignami, Giuseppe Bastianelli, Battista Grassi, and the English physician Ronald Ross identified the female of the Anopheles mosquito as the transmitter of Plasmodium protozoan to the mammals and defined its life cycle, for which he was awarded Nobel Prizes in 1902 and 1907 (Keeble 1997; Despomnier et al. 2006; FioCruz 2017).",

Also, countries with the highest number of malaria cases are in regions with poor sanitary conditions that also favor the reproduction and development of the malaria vector.\n",

Studies on the elucidation of the possible mechanism of action of this complex include two targets, i.e., the inhibition of hemozoin (malarial pigment) and DNA interaction. Experiments with mice showed that treatment 1 mg/kg of AuCQ, and parallely with equivalent concentrations of CQDP, induced a reduction in parasite cells of 84 and 44%, respectively, when compared to the untreated control. These results suggest that the complexation of gold to CQ increased the in vivo susceptibility of P. berghei to CQ (Navarro et al. 1997, 2011) and lead to the search for novel gold\u2013CQ complexes, which were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated against CQ-sentitive and CQ-resistant strains of P. falciparum. In this perspective, changes in the molecular structure of the [Au(PPh3)(CQ)]PF6 complex were performed, such as variation in the counter anion (complex 6, Fig. 8.3), in the phosphine ligand (complex 7, Fig. 8.3), and in gold oxidation state (Au (I) and Au (III)) (Navarro et al. 1997, 2004).",

Furthermore, toxicity studies showed that these complexes demonstrated less toxicity than the Ni(II) analogue (Adediji et al. 2009).

The complexes of general formula [M2+(Amodiaquine)(Cl)2] and [Mn+(primaquine)2(X)n(H2O)y], where M= VO(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), Rh(III), Pd(II), Au(III), Ag(I), Mn(II), Sn(II), and Pt(II), were prepared and studied as potential antimalarial agents (Wasi et al. 1987). The antimalarial activity of platinum (II) complexes containing 4-aminoquinoline analogues was also considered (Souza et al. 2011). All these results indicated that metal complexation to traditional antimalarial quinolones represents an attractive alternative to the development of new antimalarials agents.",

            "text": "In a very informative review on gallium(III) complexes as new promising metal-based drug candidates, Lessa et al. (2012) mentioned the complex of general formula [Ga-3-Madd]ClO4, where H2-3-Madd = 1,12 bis-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-1,5,8,12-tetraazododecane, active against chloroquine-resistant FCR-3 and Indo-1 lineages at low micromolar concentrations. The complexes [Fe-3-Eadd]ClO4 (complex 8, Fig. 8.4) and [Ga-3-Eadd]ClO4 (complex 9, Fig. 8.4), where H2-3-Eadd = 1,12-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-ethyl-benzyl-1,5,8,12-tetraazadodecane, were investigated in respect to their antimalarials activities against HB3 (chloroquine-sensitive) and Dd2 (chloroquine-resistant) P. falciparum strains. The results revealed that both complexes were effective against the HB3 chloroquine-resistant strains, but were 10\u201330 times less potent against Dh2 chloroquine-resistant strains. In the case of HB3 strains, both complexes were good inhibitors of hemozoin formation and modest to Dh2 strain. According to the authors, these results suggested that due to the similar antimalarial activities of the complexes, gallium(III) can replace iron(III) in biological environments.\n",

A series of copper (II) complexes containing naphthoquinone ligands were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated. All complexes exhibit enhanced antimalarial activity against 3D7 P. falciparum strains. Furthermore, correlations between the antimalarial activity and the metal redox couple indicate the component of the parasitic electron transport chain as a possible target of such compounds (Gokhale et al. 2006). Complexes containing buparvaquone of general formula [M(II)(L1)2(C2H5OH)2], where M(II) = Cu, Co, Ni, Mn, and Fe and L1 = buparvaquone ({3-trans-(4-tert-butylcyclohexyl) methyl-2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone}), were studied (Gokhale et al. 2003). The copper complex that showed better results demonstrated a thousand-fold enhancement in the antimalarial activity of parent quinone against 3D7 strain. Furthermore, this complex was three times more active against the chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum K1 strain when compared to the free ligand. Experiments with this strain cellular showed a 90% reduction in parasitemia at a dose of 15 mg/kg, which demonstrates the high potential of the copper complex as antimalarial agent (Gokhale et al. 2003). The antimalarial activity of gold(I) thiosemicarbazone complexes (complexes 10 and 11, Fig. 8.4) and platinum (II) and palladium(II) complexes with ligands derived from pyrazole (complexes 12\u201315, Fig. 8.4) was also investigated. These complexes exhibited better efficacy in comparison to their free ligands against D10, W2, and 3D7 strains of P. falciparum (Khanye et al. 2010; Quirante et al. 2011). Besides the enhancement of the efficacy of organic drugs, the metal complexes correspond to new alternatives for the treatment of malaria, such as the inhibition of the parasite establishment in the vector mosquito.",

Several organometallic complexes were prepared and valued as potential antimalarial agents, with ferrocene exhibiting the hightest antimalarial activity (Wani et al. 2015). Ferrocenes are highly liposoluble, stable, and nontoxic and have accessible redox potential, which make them very attractive to therapeutic applications (Van-Staveren and Metzler-Nolte 2004; Fouda et al. 2007), including malaria treatment. Inspired in ferrocene, several ferrocene-conjugated analogue structures were synthesized such as Mefloquine, artemisia, mepacrine, quinine, atovaquone, and other molecules (Biot et al. 2000; Blackie et al. 2003; Blackie and Chibale 2008).",

Among all these compounds, ferroquine is the most successful representative, already being tested in phase II clinical trials. Studies on the physiology of the parasite allowed the understanding of the mechanisms of action of new drugs and stimulated the design of new more efficient drugs. With these studies, in the near future, it is expected that metallodrugs with low toxicity and high efficiency will be found for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases such as malaria. In addition, the production costs and the final product are extremely important factors, since this guarantees the accessibility of the population of poor countries affected by these diseases.\n",
