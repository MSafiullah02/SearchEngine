Due to the importance of safety in ensuring a high quality of care, patient safety has become a fundamental aspect of the drive to improve quality, and this is receiving increasing interest from healthcare stakeholders in many countries [1]. Various stakeholders are responsible for ensuring that patient care is safely delivered and that patients are not harmed, including society overall, patients, clinicians including physicians and nurses, educators, administrators, researchers, professional bodies, governments and legislative bodies, and accrediting agencies [2].",

This act focuses on implementing a national reporting and learning system, the development of national healthcare standards and indexes, and formulating a strategic and comprehensive plan for patient safety every 5 years. In accordance with the act, the first national plan for patient safety (covering 2018 to 2022) was released in April 2018, which includes prioritizing R&D and supporting the process under both short-term and long-term national strategies [4].",

However, little is currently known about the concerns of the various healthcare stakeholders. Many modern theorists have quoted empirical evidence from the field of policy studies to suggest that policies and actions are intertwined [5]. However, national policies should actually be created using a bottom-up approach as much as possible. The report from a study of developing the national plan for patient-safety R&D [6] also emphasized the importance of regularly surveying consumers and providers to explore their concerns and interests and their implications for national strategic planning and decision-making. The various healthcare stakeholders define quality of care in different ways. Traditional survey and content analysis, and consensus panel methods with qualitative interviews are used where evidence is sparse or opinions are diverse. These methods require consultation with a large group from a geographically dispersed population, and their credibility is greatly dependent on the sampling method and panel composition [7].",

Natural language processing (NLP) facilitates the analysis of these data to extract meaning. NLP has been applied in highly diverse disciplines and applications, such as social media, political speeches, and physician discharge summaries [[8], [9], [10]]. As an unsupervised NLP technique, topic-modeling based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a statistical approach for discovering or identifying topics associated with certain words or phrases [11]. One study [12] applied the topic-modeling technique to compare narrative reviews of online communities about hospitals to the domain of governmental hospital surveys.

Topic modeling is a statistical method for uncovering abstract topics from a collection of documents [14]. For example, if a document includes \u2018law\u2019 as a topic, this document is likely to contain related words such as \u2018legislation,\u2019 \u2018medical law,\u2019 \u2018health act,\u2019 \u2018civic group(s),\u2019 \u2018duty,\u2019 \u2018inform,\u2019 \u2018rule,\u2019 \u2018policy,\u2019 and \u2018personnel.\u2019 If a document is about the topic of \u2018institutional action on patient safety,\u2019 then terms such as \u2018action,\u2019 \u2018intervention,\u2019 \u2018inquiry,\u2019 \u2018standards,\u2019 \u2018prevention,\u2019 \u2018education,\u2019 \u2018report,\u2019 \u2018regulation,\u2019 and \u2018surveillance\u2019 will co-appear with high probabilities. The name of the topic is abstracted and summarized by researchers (e.g., the topics \u2018law\u2019 or \u2018patient safety activities\u2019) based on the keywords that appear most frequently, because computer algorithms can find statistical clustering patterns of keywords but they cannot summarize the topics that keywords relate to. A document usually has a mixture of different topics, and topic modeling can capture those topics statistically using different algorithms. Topic models have several advantages when working with a large complex text data set where the topic categories might not be clear or easy to discern a priori. These models have been shown to be generally useful in several applications, such as analyzing text-based survey responses, foreign media, and FDA drug labels [8,9,14]. In this study we used the LDA algorithm developed by Blei and colleagues [11,15] to obtain the parameters for every document (i.e., Web-based documents).",

Regarding the applications to clinical documentation, one study [10] analyzed the free-text descriptions of a large repository of reports on patient safety events. Those authors were able to automatically reclassify the events that were ambiguously categorized by event reporters.

We therefore set alpha to 1.2195, and beta was freely estimated by conducting the test with the following setting: 2,000 iterations, burn-in period of 1,000 iterations, and a thinning interval of 500 iterations.

Third, we asked two expert academics working on patient safety to review our inferred themes: an oncology specialist and an emergency medicine professor affiliated to an academic tertiary hospital and university. We explained our research aims, methods, and results, and then asked the two experts to independently score their level of agreement using a 5-point scale [from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)] and provide comments and feedback, which were used when confirming and revising the topic themes.

Healthcare facilities increased their efforts in infection control and the government implemented a patient safety precaution alert system in late 2017 and comprehensive measures for preventing healthcare-associated infections, such as by releasing guidelines, training, and performing epidemic investigations and surveillance. However, the research topics did not reflect these concerns. One possible reason is that hospital infections represent strictly confidential information for each hospital, and so both the size and types of problems are unknown. Most of the cases are treated internally, and the information becomes public only if several patients got unexpected infection problems or died simultaneously. Other unusual situations, such as the increased cases of hepatitis C virus at a clinic in 2015 [27], become public after they are investigated by public health authorities. Such cases are often due to the lack of routine measurements and patient monitoring, and reviewing and improving everyday healthcare practices.",

However, a few studies have used topic modeling and social media to capture public opinions about healthcare policy from different user groups. Traditional ways to obtain a consensus from stakeholders including using group panels with the RAND Appropriate Method [29] or the Delphi technique [30]. Different stakeholders have diverse views about the quality of care that are influenced by their past experiences, expectations, and definitions of quality of care, as well as the perceived power relationship between stakeholders [7].
