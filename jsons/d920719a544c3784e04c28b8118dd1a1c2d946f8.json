Healthcare infrastructures and resources, particularly as it relates to the care of the most critically ill patients, are currently being strained globally. In this context, in the United States, the American College of Surgeons and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released recommendations for the management of elective surgical procedures [2, 3], suggesting delaying all elective procedures without high acuity in order to focus on more urgent cases, preserve valuable resources and prevent the spread of COVID-19 among healthcare providers, patient families and the public. In contrast, maintaining emergency surgery capabilities is critical for patients who require life-saving operations that cannot be delayed. We herein present our first case of acute type A aortic dissection with COVID-19 which was confirmed on the 6 th postoperative day.",

The computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed an acute type A (DeBakey type I) aortic dissection with a primary intimal tear at the level of the sinotubular junction, markedly compressed true lumen in the descending/thoracoabdominal aorta, dissection flap extending down into the superior mesenteric and bilateral renal arteries and poor contrast enhancement of the right kidney ( Figures 1A and 1B) . He was emergently transferred to the University of Michigan for further management. On arrival, the patient had a low grade fever (37.6\u00b0C) without cough, dyspnea or recent travel. He did not meet any of our institutional criteria for COVID-19 testing at that time, which included fever > 38\u00b0C, cough and/or dyspnea without a clear alternative cause, risk factors (such as immunocompromised state or age > 70 years) for developing a severe form of disease if infected, recent domestic/international travel, employment as a healthcare worker or contact with a known COVID-19 patient, and therefore he was not tested. There were a total of 33 COVID-19 cases in the State of Michigan and no case in our county (Washtenaw County) at that time [4] . Ascending and hemiarch aortic repair under moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest with retrograde cerebral perfusion was immediately performed. The procedure was uneventful with cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamp and circulatory arrest times of 107, 52 and 8 minutes.",

The chest radiograph was unremarkable ( Figure 1C) . He was diuresed due to higher-than-usual oxygen demands. He was eventually extubated on the 2nd postoperative day. The patient started ambulating with assistance. Meanwhile, he continued to be diuresed; however, his hypoxemia gradually exacerbated. The chest radiograph on the 5th postoperative day demonstrated bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates and, on that same day, he needed re-intubation ( Figure 1D ). Respiratory virus panel was sent and resulted negative. A real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 was performed and was positive. Several caregivers involved in his care were immediately quarantined afterwards, although they were all asymptomatic. His respiratory status rapidly worsened over the ensuing 48 hours (with partial pressure of O2 or PaO 2 73 mmHg, despite 100% FiO 2 ) and inhaled nitric oxide was initiated. Despite maximum medical therapy, the patient expired on the 11th postoperative day due to multiorgan failure essentially resulting from progressive respiratory failure and acute renal failure.",

While it is still unclear at what time point our patient acquired COVID-19, we suspect it was preoperatively, given the time course of his clinical deterioration. We thoroughly elicited his medical history and review of system, but he was not even considered suspicious for COVID-19 at presentation.",

There are clearly patients with mild symptoms or even asymptomatic patients who are infected with COVID-19 [5] that will not be detected by the current screening process. The currently outlined risk factors for acquisition of the disease are likely no longer relevant, as there have been > 400,000 cases in the United States with that number rapidly rising on a daily basis [1]. In order to protect patients, healthcare providers and the public, we advocate for a more liberal testing for patients who are undergoing major emergent operations. Such patients can then be placed in the appropriate isolation precautions, providers can wear the appropriate personal protective equipment and procedure rooms can be adequately sterilized postoperatively. In this context, operating surgeons have to be mindful with respect to the COVID-19 test processing time, which significantly varies among institutions ranging from 2-3 hours to days, and the possibility of false negative results.",

            "text": "This humbling experience and the ongoing spread of COVID-19 highlight how inadequate our preparation was for this pandemic, despite having witnessed the preceding situations in China, South Korea, Iran, Japan and Europe. In light of the very high mortality associated with non-operative management of type A aortic dissection and with the lack of existing data regarding concurrent aortic dissection and COVID-19 infection, it remains inconclusive to suggest that cases like the present report be delayed for these dual diagnoses. However, non-operative management may be justified in patients with COVID-19 with type A aortic dissection with severe multiple medical comorbidities, advanced age, severe malperfusion syndrome and daily heavy smoking, as the mortality of these patients can be close to 100%. Alternatively, endovascular repair may be considered if anatomically suitable, as the pulmonary burden from cardiopulmonary bypass usage and associated induced inflammatory cascade can be avoided. This fact implies the importance of cancelling all non-essential procedures with the goal to preserve and redirect life-saving healthcare resources. Given the rare incidence of aortic dissections, 6 testing such patients for COVID-19 on presentation would likely not place an excessive burden on the currently limited testing resources. Even more broadly, we may have to assume all patients needing an emergent operation may have been exposed to COVID-19. ",
