            "text": "The lectin DC-SIGN (CD209) and the related lectin DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN, CD209L) bind to a virtually identical spectrum of viral and non-viral pathogens in a carbohydrate-dependent manner (Cambi et al., 2005, Koppel et al., 2005). Both lectins recognize high-mannose carbohydrates. In addition, DC-SIGN binds to Lewis X sugars (Appelmelk et al., 2003, Feinberg et al., 2001, Guo et al., 2004, Lin et al., 2003, van Die et al., 2003, Van Liempt et al., 2004). DC-SIGN is expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000), platelets (Boukour et al., 2006, Chaipan et al., 2006), activated primary B-cells (He et al., 2006, Rappocciolo et al., 2006) and certain macrophages (Soilleux et al., 2001, Soilleux et al., 2002), whereas DC-SIGNR is found on vascular endothelium in the placenta and on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells (Bashirova et al., 2001, P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001c). In liver (Lai et al., 2006), lymph node and placenta (Soilleux et al., 2001, Soilleux et al., 2002, P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001c), both lectins are co-expressed. DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (collectively referred to as DC-SIGN/R) can concentrate virions on the cell surface, thereby facilitating engagement of the cognate cellular receptors and subsequent infectious viral entry into target cells.",

            "text": "DC-SIGN-mediated capture of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) by DCs in the anogenital mucosa was roposed to facilitate dissemination of sexually transmitted HIV-1 (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000). However, several reports indicate that the contribution of DC-SIGN to augmentation of HIV-1 infectivity by DCs is minor (Boggiano et al., 2007, Gummuluru et al., 2003). Nevertheless, DC-SIGN on platelets or activated B-cells might promote HIV-1 spread once the virus has reached the blood stream (Boukour et al., 2006, Chaipan et al., 2006, Rappocciolo et al., 2006). DC-SIGNR in lymph nodes and liver might also impact spread of HIV-1 and hepatotropic viruses, like hepatitis C virus (HCV). Indeed, polymorphisms in the DC-SIGNR neck region modulate susceptibility to HIV-1 infection (Liu et al., 2006), and maybe more impressively, a correlation between the DC-SIGNR genotype and the viral load in HCV infected patients has been documented (Nattermann et al., 2006). While the former finding is controversial (Lichterfeld et al., 2003), the observations that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are permissive for HIV-1 infection (Steffan et al., 1992) and capture HCV envelope protein E2 in a DC-SIGNR-dependent manner (Lai et al., 2006, Ludwig et al., 2004, P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2003) indicate that DC-SIGNR and possibly other lectins on LSECs might impact spread of several clinically relevant human viruses.",

            "text": "The DC-SIGN/R and CD23 genes are located in a cluster of lectin encoding genes on chromosome 19p13.3 (Soilleux et al., 2000). Liu and colleagues (2004) reported that the gene for LSECtin, another calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin, is also localized in this cluster. They found that LSECtin is co-expressed with DC-SIGNR in liver and lymph node and, like DC-SIGN/R, binds to mannose (Liu et al., 2004). We previously discovered that LSECtin, like DC-SIGN/R, augments Ebola virus (EBOV) and SARS coronavirus infection (Gramberg et al., 2005). However, in contrast to DC-SIGN/R, LSECtin failed to augment HCV and HIV-1 infection and virus interactions with LSECtin were not inhibited by the mannose polymer mannan (Gramberg et al., 2005). Thus, LSECtin might have an expression pattern similar to DC-SIGNR but it seems to interact with a more restricted spectrum of viruses and seemingly in a mannose-independent manner. Interestingly, a recent study confirmed interactions between LSECtin and EBOV and detected LSECtin on dendritic cells and macrophages under certain conditions (Dominguez-Soto et al., 2007), suggesting some similarities between the expression pattern of LSECtin and DC-SIGN. However, both the natural function and the role of LSECtin in virus infection are incompletely understood.",

LSECtin also bound to HIV-1-GP but failed to capture HIV-1 particles, demonstrating that capture of soluble GP is not necessarily predictive of virion capture.

Screening of hybridoma supernatants by ELISA identified four supernatants that specifically reacted with the antigen used for immunization. Antibodies from the respective supernatants were purified. All antibodies were reactive against recombinant LSECtin as assessed by ELISA and allowed detection of both recombinant and cellular LSECtin by Western blot (Table 1\n; Fig. 1A). However, only the D18 antibody was reactive against native, cell surface expressed LSECtin as judged by FACS analysis (Fig. 1A) and was therefore chosen for further analysis. LSECtin is a type II transmembrane protein, which, based on sequence analysis, exhibits the following domain structure: N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (CD), transmembrane domain, neck domain and C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). In order to identify the LSECtin domain recognized by D18, various portions of LSECtin were bacterially produced (Fig. 1B) and D18 reactivity against the recombinant proteins assessed by ELISA. D18 specifically reacted with the purified neck domain and all proteins containing this domain (Fig. 1C), indicating that the D18 epitope is located in the LSECtin neck region.",

Immunohistochemical staining of parental 293 cells and cells engineered to express LSECtin confirmed the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 2A, B). Staining of tissue sections revealed no evidence for LSECtin expression in any major organ/tissue, except lymph node (Fig. 2C, D), liver (Fig. 2G) and bone marrow (Fig. 2J), where LSECtin was detected with a continuous staining pattern along the sinusoids, in keeping with expression by sinusoidal endothelial cells rather than Kupffer cells, which would give a discontinuous staining pattern. Very similar staining was observed with the DC-SIGN/R-specific antibody DC28 (Baribaud et al., 2001) (Fig. 2E, H, K) and was mainly due to DC-SIGNR expression (Bashirova et al., 2001, Lai et al., 2006, P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001c). Sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver (Fig. 2I), but not lymph node (Fig. 2F), also expressed CLEC-2, a novel HIV-1 attachment factor (Chaipan et al., 2006). In the liver, anti-LSECtin immunostaining was more similar to anti-CLEC-2 immunostaining, in keeping with LSECtin expression by sinus endothelial cells, rather than sinus endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, which have been reported to express both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, and DC-SIGN alone, respectively (Lai et al., 2006). Finally, DC-SIGNR (Fig. 2N), but not LSECtin (Fig. 2M) or CLEC-2 (Fig. 2O), was expressed by vascular cells in the placenta. Thus, in agreement with previous results (Liu et al., 2004), LSECtin shows a restricted tissue expression and is only found in liver, lymph node and bone marrow sinusoids, where it is co-expressed with DC-SIGNR. In light of recent published data suggesting expression of LSECtin by human peripheral blood and thymic dendritic cells isolated ex vivo (Dominguez-Soto et al., 2007), normal thymic tissue was immunostained for LSECtin (Fig. 2P). No positive immunostaining was identified, although DC-SIGN/R (Fig. 2Q) and CD68 immunostaining (Fig. 2R) demonstrated the presence of abundant cells of macrophage/dendritic cell lineage.",

            "text": "Our previous analyses failed to detect LSECtin interactions with HIV-1 (Gramberg et al., 2005). It was unclear, however, whether LSECtin simply failed to bind to the surface unit Gp120 of the HIV-1 envelope protein or whether the failure to capture HIV-1 was due to more complex reasons. We therefore analyzed binding of a soluble HIV-1-Gp120-Fc fusion protein to CD4-negative HeLa cells transiently expressing DC-SIGN, LSECtin, Langerin and CD23. Langerin, which is exclusively expressed by Langerhans cells (Valladeau et al., 1999), was included as a positive control since we previously showed robust HIV-1-Gp120 binding to this lectin (Turville et al., 2002). CD23 served as a negative control. Cell surface expression of all lectins was readily detectable (Fig. 3A, upper panel). DC-SIGN and Langerin but not CD23 readily bound to HIV-1-Gp120 (Fig. 3A, lower panel), as expected (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000, Turville et al., 2002). To our surprise, LSECtin also captured HIV-1-Gp120 with high efficiency (Fig. 3A, lower panel). The mannose polymer mannan blocked binding of HIV-1-Gp120 and, with slightly lower efficiency, binding of soluble EBOV-GP-Fc to DC-SIGN and Langerin (Fig. 3B). In contrast, mannan did not inhibit ligand binding to LSECtin (Fig. 3B), providing further evidence that LSECtin does not recognize mannose residues on the surface of ligands. Given the similar binding of soluble Env by DC-SIGN, LSECtin and Langerin, we next compared the ability of these lectins to support HIV-1 transfer to target cells (trans-infection). While DC-SIGN-expressing cells captured and transmitted HIV-1 to target cells with high efficiency, LSECtin and Langerin-positive cells failed to bind and transmit HIV-1 (Fig. 4\n). Langerin expression also failed to enhance EBOV-GP-driven infection, while DC-SIGN and LSECtin augmented infection efficiency, as expected (Gramberg et al., 2005). Finally, all cell lines exhibited comparable susceptibility to infection with a control virus bearing the G-protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). Thus, despite efficient binding to HIV-1-Gp120, LSECtin and Langerin do not interact with HIV-1, at least under the conditions tested and thus may not support HIV-1 spread in infected patients.",

Because DC-SIGN/R and LSECtin differ in their carbohydrate specificities (Gramberg et al., 2005), we asked if these differences translate into different affinities for EBOV-GP, which might have important implications for EBOV attachment to liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells. In order to assess affinities of LSECtin and DC-SIGNR for EBOV-GP, 293 cells expressing roughly comparable amounts of these lectins (Fig. 5A) were incubated with purified soluble EBOV-GP-Fc fusion protein and binding was assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B). Quantification of binding efficiency and assessment of K\nD values employing a previously described method (Lozach et al., 2003) revealed comparable high affinity binding for LSECtin (K\nD\n = 21 nM) and DC-SIGNR (K\nD\n = 26 nM) (Fig. 5C). Thus, LSECtin and DC-SIGNR on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells might be equally adept at capturing soluble EBOV-GP and possibly EBOV particles.",

We investigated whether LSECtin was also capable of ligand internalization. B-THP cells (Wu et al., 2004) expressing exogenous DC-SIGN or LSECtin, but not control B-THP cells, readily captured soluble Alexa-labeled EBOV-GP. Binding was lectin dependent because a cell population double positive for lectin and EBOV-GP was readily detectable by flow cytometry. The population of double positive B-THP LSECtin cells was relatively heterogeneous and less prominent than that observed with B-THP DC-SIGN cells due to reduced expression of LSECtin relative to DC-SIGN. When cells were maintained at 4 \u00b0C, EBOV-GP binding could be abrogated by trypsin digestion, which cleaved both DC-SIGN and LSECtin (Fig. 6A and data not shown, the remaining LSECtin signal was most likely due to unspecific reactivity of B-THP LSECtin cells with antibodies; T.G. and S.P., unpublished observations), suggesting that EBOV-GP was localized to the cell surface under these conditions. In contrast, shifting cells to 37 \u00b0C for 5 or 15 min before trypsin digestion abrogated lectin expression but preserved the EBOV-GP signal, indicating that the soluble protein had been internalized. After successful cellular uptake, the lectin\u2013ligand complexes might be dissociated by low pH in endosomal compartments. Alternatively, the complexes might remain stable at low pH and might traffic to lysosomes. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we assessed whether exposure to low pH released EBOV-GP from DC-SIGN/R and LSECtin expressing T-REx cells. At neutral pH, all lectin expressing cells bound to EBOV-GP with comparable efficiency (data not shown). Upon treatment with medium of pH 6.0 or lower, EBOV-GP was released from DC-SIGN/R, with the association of DC-SIGNR with ligand being slightly more resistant to low pH than DC-SIGN\u2013ligand complexes (Fig. 6B). In contrast, even exposure to pH 5.5 did not dissolve LSECtin\u2013EBOV-GP complexes (Fig. 6B), suggesting that intact LSECtin\u2013ligand complexes might traffic to lysosomes.",

LSECtin bound to soluble dimeric EBOV-GP and HIV-1-GP and enhanced EBOV-GP-driven entry. However, LSECtin failed to capture and transmit HIV-1 to target cells, suggesting that LSECtin does not interact with trimeric virion-associated HIV-1-GP. Binding of EBOV-GP to LSECtin triggered internalization and lectin\u2013ligand complexes remained stable at low pH, indicating that intact LSECtin\u2013ligand complexes might be transported into lysosomes. Thus, LSECtin like DC-SIGN might function as an antigen uptake receptor, but the intracellular fate of their ligands might be different.

Staining of tissue sections revealed that LSECtin and DC-SIGNR are co-expressed by liver, lymph node and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial cells (Fig. 2), which is in agreement with a previous report (Liu et al., 2004). LSECs are exposed to blood from the systemic circulation and from the gut and exhibit powerful scavenger capabilities (Lalor et al., 2006). Lectins like mannose receptor (MR), DC-SIGNR and LSECtin might contribute to the scavenger function of LSECs (Lalor et al., 2006). Whether the interaction of these lectins with viruses present in the blood stream preferentially leads to viral uptake, processing and MHC presentation or augmentation of viral infectivity remains to be determined. Notably, LSECs are permissive for HIV-1 infection (Steffan et al., 1992) and polymorphisms in the DC-SIGNR neck region might impact susceptibility to HIV infection (Liu et al., 2006). Moreover, LSECs capture HCV envelope protein via DC-SIGNR (Lai et al., 2006, Ludwig et al., 2004) and certain variations in the DC-SIGNR neck region are associated with a reduced viral load in HCV patients (Nattermann et al., 2006). Thus, DC-SIGNR on LSECs and lymph node and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelium might promote HIV-1 and particularly HCV infection. By contrast, LSECtin does not interact with these viruses but our cell culture data indicate that LSECtin could facilitate filovirus interactions with sinusoidal endothelium in liver, lymph node and bone marrow. Potentially increased expression of LSECtin due to elevated cytokine production in the context of EBOV infection might facilitate these interactions. Liver and particularly lymph nodes are prominent early targets of EBOV in experimentally infected macaques, whereas infection of bone marrow is observed at later stages (Geisbert et al., 2003a, Geisbert et al., 2003b). Because infection of the vascular endothelium in these organs is only detected during the later stages of EBOV replication (Geisbert et al., 2003b), one might postulate that LSECtin and DC-SIGNR mainly promote viral spread by virus capture and transmission to adjacent target cells, like hepatocytes or Kupffer cells. In fact, LSECs can bind and transmit duck hepatitis B virus to adjacent hepatocytes but do not become infected themselves (Breiner et al., 2001), suggesting that these cells, like DCs, might promote viral infection in trans.",

            "text": "LSECtin did not bind or transmit HIV-1 (Fig. 4), which is in agreement with our previous results (Gramberg et al., 2005). However, LSECtin captured a soluble HIV-1 Gp120-Fc fusion protein with high efficiency (Fig. 3), suggesting that the binding interface present in soluble Gp120 is obscured or absent in Env trimers on HIV-1 particles. Notably, similar results were obtained with Langerin (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), a C-type lectin specifically expressed on Langerhans cells (Valladeau et al., 1999), probably the first cell type to come into contact with sexually transmitted HIV-1. The discrepancy between Gp120 and virion binding by LSECtin indicates that soluble and virion-associated Gp120 might differ in terms of content and/or surface exposure of glycans. Alternatively, the multimerization status of Gp120 (soluble Fc fusion protein is most likely dimeric while virion-associated protein is trimeric) or the lectin expression level might play a role. For Langerin, the situation might be different because it has recently been proposed that Langerin efficiently captures HIV-1 and targets bound virions for degradation in intracellular compartments (de Witte et al., 2007). In light of these results, our finding that Langerin expressing HeLa cells did not capture HIV-1 can be explained in three ways. Exogenous Langerin on HeLa cells, unlike endogenous Langerin on Langerhans cells, might not be capable of binding HIV-1, maybe because a cofactor present on Langerhans cells is missing. Alternatively, as for LSECtin, lectin expression levels might play a role. Thus, higher copy numbers of surface expressed Langerin might be required for binding to HIV-1 as compared to binding to soluble gp120. In this context, it needs to be pointed out that Langerhans cells most likely express substantially higher levels of Langerin relative to the transfected cells used in the present study. Finally, Langerin-bound HIV-1 might be rapidly endocytosed and degraded in HeLa cells. However, the absence of any specific HIV-1 binding to Langerin expressing HeLa and 293T cells even early after exposure (Fig. 4 and data not shown) suggests that HIV-1 degradation might not account for the effects observed. In any case, it is notable that binding to soluble Gp120 is not necessarily predictive for binding to virus particles (present manuscript) and capture of virions does not necessarily result in transmission (Baribaud et al., 2001, P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2001b). Detailed analysis of the determinants involved might yield important insights into the molecular mechanisms behind lectin-mediated augmentation of viral infectivity.",

            "text": "Ligand captured by DC-SIGN, but not DC-SIGNR (Guo et al., 2004), is endocytosed and transported into late endosomes/lysosomes (Engering et al., 2002). The acidic milieu in this compartment dissociates the lectin\u2013ligand complex and DC-SIGN might be recycled to the cell surface (Engering et al., 2002). Soluble EBOV glycoprotein bound to LSECtin expressing cells at 37 \u00b0C but not at 4 \u00b0C was protected against protease digestion (Fig. 6A), suggesting that LSECtin\u2013ligand complexes were also endocytosed. A recent study by Dominguez-Soto and colleagues (2007) confirms and extends this observation by showing that tyrosine- and diglutamic-containing motifs in the cytoplasmic domain mediate rapid LSECtin internalization. LSECtin like DC-SIGN might therefore function as an antigen uptake receptor. However, the fate of the endocytosed lectins might be different. Low pH dissociated DC-SIGN/R\u2013ligand complexes, whereas LSECtin\u2013ligand complexes remained stable, even in an acidic milieu similar to that observed in lysosomes (Fig. 6B). Thus, both LSECtin and ligand might be degraded in lysosomes whereas DC-SIGN might be recycled to the cell surface. Obviously, EBOV escapes degradation upon LSECtin-mediated uptake and uses this lectin for augmentation of infectivity (Fig. 4; Gramberg et al., 2005). These results are not unexpected because endosomal/lysosomal enzymes were shown to dissociate GP1 (which is bound by LSECtin) from GP2 (which drives membrane fusion) (Chandran et al., 2005, Schornberg et al., 2006), thereby most likely releasing EBOV from LSECtin and allowing the virus to fuse with the vesicle membrane.",
