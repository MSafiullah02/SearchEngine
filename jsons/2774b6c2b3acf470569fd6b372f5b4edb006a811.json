Second, the pattern of CD8 + T-cell activation in 1\u00b0HLH, in most cases in the apparent absence of a microbial trigger, is very similar to that in 2\u00b0HLH triggered by a viral infection. Third, strong activation of cytotoxic CD4 + T cells is a signature of 1\u00b0HLH that is much less pronounced in virus-triggered 2\u00b0HLH. These findings are relevant for understanding the pathogenesis of different HLH variants and have implications for their differential diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 193, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous studies have reported increased HLA-DR expression on T cells [30] [31] [32] and a mild decrease in the percentage of CD45RA + CD4 + T cells [31, 33] in children with active HLH. However, this has not been analyzed in larger cohorts with clearly defined disease subtypes and the current possibilities to confirm genetic disease. Here, we observed a strong activation of the CD8 + T-cell compartment in patients with 2\u00b0V-HLH and 1\u00b0HLH, while this was less pronounced in patients with 2\u00b0HLH in the absence of infections, including patients with MAS. In some infants, disease states fulfilling all current clinical criteria of 2\u00b0HLH even occurred in the absence of any measurable T-cell activation. In patients with 1\u00b0HLH and 2\u00b0V-HLH, activation was polyclonal with a mild perturbation of the normal repertoire. A large fraction of CD8 + T cells had a CCR7 \u2212 CD45RA \u2212 effector memory phenotype that was associated with downregulation of CD127, and upregulation of HLA-DR, PD-1, CD57, and perforin. This differentiation pattern is similar to that of virus-specific CD8 + T cells in patients undergoing an acute virus infection in the absence of HLH. In CMV infection, the percentage of CD127 \u2212 cells correlates with the level of viral replication [34] and incomplete virus control increases the fraction of CD57 + CD8 + T cells [26] . CD57 defines T cells with a high lytic granule content and cytotoxic activity [27] . Thus, the CD8 + T cell phenotype that was highly represented in 1\u00b0HLH and 2\u00b0V-HLH (CCR7 \u2212 CD45RA \u2212 CD127 \u2212 HLA-DR + PD-1 + CD57 + and perforin + ) is a phenotype that is also observed in patients with highly active, uncontrolled viral infections in the absence of features of HLH [35] [36] [37] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 70, "end": 74, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 75, "end": 79, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 80, "end": 84, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 149, "end": 153, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1255, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1336, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1421, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1708, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1713, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1718, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Interestingly, however, in our study, only 3 of 31 infants with 1\u00b0HLH had a proven concomitant viral infection and apart from 1 patient with periungual S. aureus infection, no bacterial or opportunistic infections were detected.

Obviously, although in most patients an extensive search for systemic viral infections including EBV, CMV, adenovirus, HHV-6, and HHV-8 and Parvovirus has been performed, these investigations do not rule out all infections, particularly with respiratory or gastrointestinal viruses. It is unclear, however, whether a local infection without systemic spread is sufficient to trigger and maintain the very strong systemic T-cell activation observed in 1\u00b0HLH. At least in perforin-deficient PKO mice, only systemic persistent infection with LCMV or MCMV can induce HLH [12, 38] , while local infections with respiratory viruses (RSV, pneumonia virus of mice, influenza) do not cause HLH in PKO mice [39] . Overall, it therefore remains a relevant possibility that the highly activated T-cell phenotype observed in human 1\u00b0HLH is in most cases not driven by a persisting viral (or other microbial) infection. This would imply that in humans, perforin-mediated control of T-cell stimulation is required for maintenance of T-cell homeostasis even in the absence of continued viral stimulation. Such pathophysiological differences between 1\u00b0HLH and 2\u00b0V-HLH are also suggested by a different pattern of CD4 + T cell activation in the two conditions. In 1\u00b0HLH, the percentage of CD4 + T cells with a highly activated HLA-DR + CD127 \u2212 PD1 + CD57 + perforin + phenotype was higher than in 2\u00b0V-HLH. Although perforin-expressing CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic activity have been described in persistent virus infections such as HIV, EBV and CMV infections [28, 40] in none of these conditions these cells reach the levels we observed in primary HLH. The stronger activation of CD4 + T cells in 1\u00b0HLH than in 2\u00b0V-HLH suggests qualitative differences in the activation of Tcell populations. Thus, the cytotoxicity defect and the associated impaired elimination of stimulating APC [41] could favor additional recruitment of CD4 + T cells into the inflammatory response through prolonged presentation of antigen via MHC class II. What is the function of the cytotoxic CD4 + T cells? It has been speculated that they play a role in containing viral infections tropic for MHC class II positive cells such as EBV in B cells [40] . They could also take over a prominent role in antiviral responses to pathogens that have evolved mechanisms to evade antigen presentation on MHC class I molecules [42] . However, in view of the above considerations, it is also conceivable that these cytotoxic CD4 + T cells have a role in human T-cell homeostasis that is independent of infection control, e.g. by controlling APC [41] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 31, "end": 34, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 603, "end": 607, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 608, "end": 611, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 733, "end": 737, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1582, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1586, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1904, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2243, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2413, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2626, "end": 2630, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A relevant number of infants without cytotoxicity defects fulfilling all current diagnostic criteria for HLH in the absence of an infection had mostly naive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with very few cells expressing markers of activation or advanced differentiation.

In fact, we have recently documented similar sCD25 levels in immunodeficient patients fulfilling clinical HLH criteria that completely lacked T and NK cells [6] . In the current study, we have formally labeled these patients as 2\u00b0HLH, but as discussed previously, it is questionable whether the hemophagocytic inflammatory syndrome in these patients should really be called HLH. This study further illustrates, that the current clinical criteria for HLH cannot differentiate between T cell driven disease (\"bona fide\" HLH) and hemophagocytic syndromes without T-cell activation [6] . Because of obvious implications for therapy, in particular if targeting T cells, a revision and prospective validation of the diagnostic criteria is needed.
