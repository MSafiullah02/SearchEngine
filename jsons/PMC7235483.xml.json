Otherwise, urgent visits and surgery that cannot be postponed are carried out regularly. For patients undergoing treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs for chronic dermatological diseases, such as psoriasis, several guidelines suggest to assess on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis the initiation of a new therapy with a biological drug as well as the possible suspension in case of positivity.\n2\n Apart from psoriasis, which can sometimes also be treated in an alternative way, we must focus our attention on the most fragile patients in dermatology, that is, oncologic patients suffering from advanced melanoma. In fact, we should remember that cancer\u2010related treatments may cause immunosuppression, and the first available data suggest that patients with cancer have a risk of excess mortality due to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.\n3\n\n",
