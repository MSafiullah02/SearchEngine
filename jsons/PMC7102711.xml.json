Since September 2012, 27 countries have reported cases of MERS and WHO has been notified of 2079 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least 722 deaths by the end of August 2017 [2]. MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae and the genus Betacoronavirus causes the disease [3]. Human-to-human transmission appears to be limited to family and health care settings [4]. In general, a significant proportion of the cases are suspected to be a result of zoonotic transmission. Serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection of dromedaries was reported from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Qatar, Jordan, Pakistan and Africa [2], [5], [6]. In addition, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected in nasal swabs of dromedaries in Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and UAE [2], [6], [7], [8]. Moreover, widespread circulation of different genetic variants of MERS-CoV in camels, with geographic clustering of human and camel MERS-CoV sequences [6], [9]. Few studies have provided evidence for zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV from camels [6], [10], [11], but the mechanisms of direct or indirect zoonotic transmission have yet to be known.",

The data showed that Out of the 698 camel nasal swabs tested, 195 were MERS-CoV positive and 503 were negative by the ICA, while 394 were positive and 304 were negative by the UpE and Orf1a real-time RTPCR, therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of the ICA compared to those of the real-time RT-PCR were 49.49% and 100%, respectively. Previous reports recorded sensitivity and screening quality of the ICA assay found to be 93.9% and 100%, respectively, compared with that of rtRT-PCR. Also they reported that the ICA was less sensitive for the detection of MERS-CoV antigen (105 TCID50) than was the UpE real-time PCR (104 TCID50). The difference between the assay sensitivities might be regarded to the release of subgenomic RNA after the onset of cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in cell culture, including the UpE target fragment, as previously reported [13], [14], [19]. Also the Rapid MERS-CoV Ag assay cannot detect MERS-CoV loads < 104 or Ct value >30. Previous report pointed out that the MERS-CoV rtRT-PCR assay is the specific assay for molecular studies in a variety of animal species and human [12], [13]. Overall, rapid screening tests are less sensitive than are confirmatory tests; however, the advantages of using rapid screening tests are the high throughput and rapid turnaround time, without requirements of sample preparation and the use of special equipment. Therefore, the ICA is considered satisfactory to be used for screening camel herds against MERS-CoV antigen across animal markets, and slaughterhouses, followed by a confirmatory test for positive samples.",
