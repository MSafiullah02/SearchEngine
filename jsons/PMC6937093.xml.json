Previous small studies have suggested that rapid molecular viral testing might reduce antibiotic use and improve influenza antiviral use.31 32 We have recently shown in a large pragmatic randomised controlled trial (ResPOC)33 that routine syndromic molecular POCT for respiratory viruses (using the FilmArray respiratory panel) in adults presenting to hospital with acute respiratory illness was associated with a number of clinical benefits compared with routine clinical care including a reduction in unnecessary antibiotics use, and a reduced length of hospital stay. It also suggested improved influenza detection and antiviral use and better side room utilisation, although the number of patients infected with influenza was small and the study was not powered to evaluate outcomes in this subgroup.33 This follow-on study seeks to definitively evaluate the impact of routine molecular POCT for influenza on the detection of patients infected with influenza, their clinical care and outcome. Accepting the unpredictability of influenza activity year on year, this study is designed to recruit larger numbers of patients infected with influenza, and powered to evaluate the impact of POCT on national guideline recommended antiviral use. In addition, the novel use of sampling and deferred viral testing in the control group allows a direct assessment of missed diagnosis of influenza in hospitalised adults.",

Rapid and appropriate use of NAI treatment in influenza may also lead to decreased complication and mortality and may shorten length of stay in hospital. The rapid detection of viruses may improve isolation facility use within the NHS with subsequent reduction in nosocomial transmission of viruses and improvements in patient flow through acute areas. The use of a POCT for respiratory viruses may also identify patients where unnecessary antibiotic use can be safely discontinued, promoting antibiotic stewardship and reducing antimicrobial resistance.",
