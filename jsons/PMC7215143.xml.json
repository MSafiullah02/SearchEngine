            "text": "Diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are strongly related to a higher risk of mortality or disease's severity among COVID-19 patients. In China, from 44,672 confirmed cases, 4.7% were critical, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 49%. Patients without comorbidities had lower CFR (0.9%), while those with CVDs, diabetes and hypertension had higher rates (10.5%, 7.3%, 6.5%, respectively) [1]. Obesity is another comorbidity raising the risk of complications in COVID-19 infection. The immune system acts upon inflammation that occurs in adipose tissue due to obesity, increasing vulnerability to infections [2]. Increased circulating levels of many cytokines and proteins released by adipocytes are associated with inflammation in obese individuals [3]. Inflammation from adipose tissue generates chronic and systemic metabolic alterations leading to dyslipidemia, hypertension, CVD and diabetes, thus increasing the risk of infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)2. It is thought that SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, suppress anti-viral type IFN-\u03b3 responses in the early stage of infection leading to an uncontrolled viral replication. This mechanism later leads to an influx of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, resulting in hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage lung tissue (i.e. pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome). Specific Th1/Th17 cells may be activated and contribute to increased inflammation. These facts and the higher mortality by COVID-19 observed in those with underlying diseases indicates that immune response is a determining factor to COVID-19 outcome [4].",

            "text": "According to phylogenetic analyses, SARS-CoV-2 is related to other existing respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5]. SARS-CoV infection accounted for 8098 cases and 774 deaths in 26 countries [6], meanwhile, MERS-CoV infection was identified in 27 countries, with 2449 confirmed cases and 845 deaths [7]. As is being observed in COVID-19, MERS-CoV infection also caused more severe complications in older and immunocompromised patients with a history of diabetes, renal failure, and lung diseases [8]. According to genome sequencing, SARS-CoV-2 is about 89% identical to bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21, 82% identical to human SARS-CoV and about 50% to MERS-CoV [5,9]. Several phylogenetic analyses suggests the bat as most probable animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, and as both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted from bats to palm civets or dromedary camels, and then to humans, it is possible though that another animal plays the role of intermediate host between bat and human in SARS-CoV-2 infection [10]. These viruses have a structural protein, the Spike glycoprotein (S) that is responsible for its binding to host cells [11]. According to Hoffman [12] protein S is primed by human serine protease (TMPRSS2) and recognized by the cell receptor. A recent study described by Liu [11] shows that SARS-CoV entering in the respiratory tract depends on a receptor-binding domain (RBD) to bind to the host, and protein S has two trimers that bind to the heterodimer of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). A synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RBD analysis indicated that the virus enters into the host cell through ACE2 binding. However, MERS-CoV binds specifically to another receptor, dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) [11,13]. Therefore, since SARS-CoV-2 is analogous to SARS-CoV, it is suggested that both use ACE2 as the main mechanism for cell entry.",

Similar risk evidence among people with diabetes has been reported for the previous two CoV infections, SARS in 2002 MERS in 2012 [27]. Studies have associated diabetes with greater weight loss and increased lung inflammation with macrophage infiltrates similar to those observed in the disease [27]. The risk of infections in patients with diabetes can be reduced, although it cannot be completely eliminated, by good glycemic control. For all people with diabetes (over 2 years old) pneumococci and annual vaccination against influenza are recommended. In addition, patients with diabetes have a serious disease when infected with respiratory infections. In fact, diabetes was seen as an important risk factor for mortality in patients infected with pandemic influenza (H1N1) in 2009, SARS-CoV and MERS-SCoV [28]. Glycemic homeostasis requires close quantitative and temporal regulation of glucose flow through different organs. Most of the circulating glucose in the body is in a stable configuration, similar to the biochemical characteristics of the cell wall from commensal bacteria found in the individual [29]. In the immune system, host-pathogen and host-host interactions take place through the recognition and binding of oligosaccharides in so-called C type lectin receptors (CLRs), which will induce a specific immune response. Several C type lectins recognize oligosaccharides rich in sugars such as mannose and fucose, which have a similar chemical structure to glucose [30], as SARS-CoV-2 recognition is through protein S, a glycoprotein, it may as well increase inflammatory processes [12]. In addition, the connection of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 in people with uncontrolled hyperglycemia may be important in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Possible changes in ACE2 glycosylation, as well as viral peak protein (S) glycosylation, both possibly induced by uncontrolled hyperglycemia, may alter both virus binding to ACE2 and immune response intensity against the virus [31].",

The ACEi and ARB drugs targets the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) and are also used in diabetes treatment, leading to an increased ACE2 expression that has been suggested by Fang [32] as risk increaser for severity of COVID-19, since SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 to enter the cells. In contrast, the study by Meng [33], in a hypertensive Chinese population with COVID-19 under treatment with ACEi/ARB drugs, displayed an attenuated inflammatory response. By inhibiting IL-6 cytokine levels they achieved a better clinical result: higher CD3+ and CD8++ T cell counts in peripheral blood and lower viral load peak in comparison to other antihypertensive drugs. In addition, during hospitalization, 12 patients from the non-ACEi/ARB group (48%) were considered severe and one patient died versus ACEi/ARB group with 4 severe patients (23.5%) and no deaths. Therefore, there is no evidence that increased ACE2 expression by these drugs is indeed harmful, and further studies are needed to clarify their effects on COVID-19 infection. Also, the IL-6 controlled levels leading to better clinical results showed that an equilibrated inflammatory response is determining a better outcome for COVID-19 disease.",

            "text": "It has been reported that patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 present the cytokine storm (CS) phenomenon, an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CS can be triggered by infectious diseases, rheumatic diseases, and tumor immunotherapy, and it generally presents as systemic inflammation, and multiple organ failure [34]. Among the consequences of CS on lung viral infections are epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis, resulting in vascular leakage and alveolar edema ultimately leading to hypoxia; impaired T cell response, accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages, changed tissue homeostasis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the last being a primary cause of death in SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV patients [35]. The levels of inflammatory factors were measured in a study reported by Huang [36], including 41 COVID-19 patients (13 ICU and 28 non-ICU patients). IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and others inflammatory factors were increased in both ICU and non-ICU patients compared to healthy adults. ICU patients showed higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 than non-ICU patients, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with higher disease severity. A retrospective cohort study conducted by Zhou [37] reported elevated IL-6 blood levels in non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course of COVID-19 illness. Other studies also reported IL-6 increased levels in patients with severe COVID-19 [[38], [39], [40]]. In Anhui, China, a clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029765) using the IL-6 receptor-targeted monoclonal antibody (mAb) tocilizumab, reported improvement of respiratory function and rapid fever control in 21 patients with severe COVID-19. All patients recovered and were discharged from hospital, including two who were in critical condition [41]. This indicates the need of targeting anti-inflammatory strategies to the treatment of COVID-19 and demonstrates that a balanced immune host response is crucial to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection successfully.",

Its action is mediated by binding its active form 1-\u03b1-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) to its receptor, VDR, expressed in several immune cells [42,43]. VD3 has a genomic binding site (VDR-GP), in which a transcriptional complex is formed modulating the expression of genes such as ACE and the VDR itself [42]. According to Sassi [42], individuals with respiratory infections and sepsis had exacerbated symptoms and reduced VD3 levels. When using VD3 as an experimental treatment protocol in patients with respiratory infections, it was observed infection reduction and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, which are produced by helper (Th)1 cells [42]. Besides on acting on the immune system, this hormone plays an important role in metabolic disorders such as the pathophysiology of diabetes, modulating the expression of insulin and reducing systemic inflammation; regulating blood pressure by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); and in obesity, regulating adipogenesis and the production and release of adipokines and cytokines. As VD3 is connected to various metabolic pathways and immune system response, it becomes important to identify it as a therapeutic target [43].",

The role of medications generally used by individuals affected with diabetes, hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases, especially ACE inhibitors is debatable since those drugs lead to ACE2 receptor overexpression, associated to SARS-CoV-2 cell's entry. After virus entry into the cell, it multiplies until reaches many copies, generating a more acute and late inflammatory response. Thus, a storm of cytokines occurs that end up harming healthy cells. In order to regulate inflammation and reduce damage to healthy cells, VD can modulate a favorable immune response and could hypothetically reduce levels of associated complications.",
