Daegu is the 4 th largest city in the population of 2,500,000, surrounded by North Gyeongsang Province. More than 1,000 persons of the religious group attended worship services kneeling on the floor at a relatively small space for the congregation on Feb. 8 and 15. Since Feb. 18, when the first case related to that religious group was identified, the highest number of new cases in a day reached 813 on Feb. 29 ( Figure 1 ) [2] . Since then, the daily number of new cases started to decrease and became below 100 on Mar. 15. Remaining concerns are persistent small cluster outbreaks and an increasing number of imported cases from outside of Korea. Currently, many countries in the world are suffering from surging outbreaks. Although principal emergency strategies are common [3] , COVID-19 is quite different from other known diseases and we have to share our experience and knowledge to overcome this COVID-19 pandemic.",

Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and commercial diagnostic companies started to set up a real-time RT-PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 as soon as the genetic sequences were released. KCDC wanted to boost large-scale DNA analysis capabilities after having experienced the 2015 MERS outbreak. By early March, Korea was capable of running as many as 20,000 tests a day, and total 433,211 tests have been performed as of Apr. 3. Rapidly implemented diagnostic techniques enabled screening contacts proactively and early diagnosis. The relatively shorter period of symptom onset to diagnosis of COVID-19 (7 days in Korea vs. 10 days in China) has led to the rapid isolation of patients and reduction of further transmission [1] . With an increasing number of suspected and/or symptomatic patients to be tested for COVID-19, there has been a need for a safe and efficient screening system. Procedures for obtaining nasopharyngeal swabs, recommended for detection of SARS-CoV-2, are considered as aerosol-generating procedures, and require specific facilities such as airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) which need disinfection and ventilation between patients.",

The shortage of healthcare services has become more severe during this COVID-19 pandemic situation. As well as the essential goods, including hand sanitizers, N95 respirators, and ventilators, the hospital beds are lacking. The surge of the outbreak has led to the breakdown of healthcare systems and an increase in case fatality rates in many countries. Although COVID-19 starts with mild symptoms, about 15% of patients with COVID-19 are progressing to severe, and 5% are requiring ICU care within 5-7 days [5] . They are hospitalized for several weeks till recovery. The hospital beds would be quickly saturated with mild or moderate cases in the early phase of massive outbreak situations. It would be difficult to find beds for patients diagnosed later and some of them could experience aggravation during home isolation as happened in Daegu [1] . Because the early diagnosis and adequate initial management are crucial for a better prognosis of COVID-19, we tested contacts right after epidemiologic investigation. It is less likely that the hospital systems are prepared sufficiently for all the patients with this COVID-19, even in the countries with highperforming health systems. The rapidly deteriorating patients will eventually have adverse outcomes if they don't receive appropriate supportive management in time. Therefore, we established the systems to triage patients and prepared facilities for patients with variable severity.",

            "text": "Daegu. Makeshift wards have been dedicated for patients with COVID-19 in hospitals, and public hospitals have been transformed for COVID-19 care only. Temporary AIIRs using mobile machines generating negative-air-pressure and temporary ICU beds have been prepared. Volunteering doctors and nurses have been taking care of patients. Military personnel and ambulance workers were sent to Daegu from other regions. In addition, some of the patients were transferred to hospitals in other regions. Hospitals for COVID-19 care have been designated for the efficient use of limited resources. The continuous communication and collaboration of professional societies with health authorities and local authorities are the important component for the efficient and rapid response to the health crisis. The Korean Society of Infectious Disease formed the committee for COVID-19 response on Jan 27 and organized the multidisciplinary committee with 10 professional societies including Korean Society of Epidemiology, Korean Society of Healthcare-associated Infection Control and Prevention, Korean Society of Critical Care Medicine, and Korean Society of Emergency Medicine on Feb 4. This multidisciplinary committee have had weekly meeting with KCDC and Ministry of Health and Welfare. We advised installing DT system and implementing strategies to triage patients and prepare facilities for patients with variable severity including LTCs. In Korea, from the painful experiences in 2015 MERS outbreak, the preparedness for emerging infectious diseases (EID) has advanced in terms of diagnostic capacities, transparent risk communications, and the cooperation of people. Although we had built more isolation units in hospitals, we now realize that those are not sufficient to overcome this massive epidemic. The threat of EID would be continued and we do not know how and when it would come. Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, experienced the SARS outbreak, have well prepared for EID and are responding efficiently against COVID-19. Investigation for the built of National Hospitals for Infectious Diseases and for specialists to take care of outbreaks should be put at the top priority for our future safety.",
