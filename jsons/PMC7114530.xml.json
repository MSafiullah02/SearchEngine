            "text": "Host specificity, tissue tropism and virulence of CoVs are dictated by interactions between the spike glycoproteins of the viruses and cellular glycoproteins on surface receptors. Receptor binding and cell entry is essential steps for virus entry into host cell, which leads to internalization of the viruses (Park et al., 2014, Liu et al., 2015). An envelope-anchored spike protein mediates coronavirus entry into cells (Liu et al., 2015). The spike ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit, S1, and a membrane fusion subunit, S2. Two domains in S1, calls S1-NTD and S1-CTD, can potentially function as receptor-binding domains (Li, 2012, Li, 2015) In some CoVs, entry mechanisms progress via sialic acid interactions with spike and/or hemagglutinin esterase glycoproteins (Haijema et al., 2003, Kuo et al., 2000, Phillips et al., 1999, Sanchez et al., 1999). The spike protein of Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) binds carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 1a for cell penetration while human (HCoV-NL63) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV recognize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2) on host cells (Dveksler et al., 1991, Dveksler et al., 1993). Aminopeptidase N (APN) serves as receptor for feline (FCoV), canine (CCoV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), PEDV as well as human (HCoV -229E) (Delmas et al., 1992, Tresnan et al., 1996, Yeager et al., 1992, Kolb et al., 1998, Li, 2015, Liu et al., 2015).",

            "text": "APN/CD13 is a 150 kDa, zinc dependent metalloprotease consisting of 967 amino acids (Rawlings and Barrett, 1995). It is ubiquitously present in diverse organs, tissues and cell types (Luan and Xu, 2007). It is expressed as a glycosylated homodimer on the surface of epithelial cells of liver, intestine, kidney and respiratory tract fibroblasts and leukocytes (Kenny and Maroux, 1982, Lendeckel et al., 2000, Nam and Lee, 2010). Additionally, APN is found on endothelial cells such as cerebral astrocytes as well as pericytes and synaptic membrane in the central nervous system (Kay et al., 1994, Soichiro et al., 1983, Mina-Osorio et al., 2008). APN cleaves the N-terminal amino acids from peptides. In addition, APN plays role as a receptor and signaling molecule (Mina-Osorio et al., 2008). A seven domain organization has been described for APN structure. The first domain constitutes a short cytoplasmic tail on the N-terminal end (amino acids [aa] 1\u20137). Domain II (aa 8\u201339) consists of the transmembrane segment and links to a stalk forming domain III (aa 40\u201370). Domain IV spans from aa 71 to 252. The peptidase activity is housed by domains V and VI (aa 253\u2013580). Located on the C terminus is domain VII consisting of aa 581\u2013967 (Sjostrom et al., 2000).",

Further, expression of pAPN in non-permissive Madin-Darby canine kidney cells resulted in susceptibity of these cells to PEDV (Li et al., 2009). However, PEDV fails to infect native porcine APN expressing swine testis cells which are highly susceptible to TGEV (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). In the current study, by constitutive expression of pAPN in non-susceptible NIH3T3 cells, we have sought to annotate the previous findings stipulating pAPN receptor function for PEDV. In addition, this study aimed at identification of using pAPN protein domain(s) that are critical for its binding and entry.",

As of fact and characteristic of all viruses, the attachment involves definite interactions with precise receptors which determine host specificity and tissue tropism (Sandrine et al., 2012). The extensively studied coronavirus prototype, MHV is able to penetrate the hepatocytes through the biliary glycoprotein on the surface of the liver and cause hepatitis (Godfraind and Coutelier, 1998). In alphacoronaviruses, pAPN on the microvillar membrane of the small intestine is the known gateway for TGEV infections in swine (Delmas et al., 1992, Delmas et al., 1994) while human APN (CD13) is the attachment receptor for HCoV-229E which targets infections to lungs where it has been associated with common cold or severe pneumonia in immunocompromised persons (Lachance et al., 1998, Pene et al., 2003). APN/CD13 is a monomeric or homodimeric type II membrane-bound zinc-dependent metalloproteinase, which cleaves neutral or basic amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides and can release neutral and basic amino acid from the N-terminal of peptides (Mou et al., 2009). It is widely expressed on various cells such as epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney, hepatocytes, osteoclasts, endometrial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, bone marrow stromal cells and on neuronal synaptic membranes. APN is involved in many physiology and pathology processes such as hydrolysis of nutrients, inactivation of bioactive peptides, inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer (Bank et al., 2008, Yamashita et al., 2007, Shimizu et al., 2002). In 2006, the 3D structure of APN has been studied according to the co-crystal complex of APN and bestatin by Ito (Ito et al., 2006). Based on this report on overall structure and subunits of APN, it is composed of consists of 26 \u03b1-helices and 26 \u03b2-strands and can be divided into four domains, an N-terminal \u03b2-domain (Met1-Asp193), a catalytic domain (Phe194-Gly444), a middle \u03b2-domain (Thr445-Trp546), and a C-terminal \u03b1-domain (Ser547-Ala870). They also reported the C-terminal \u03b1-domain might be important as the active site. More recently, Shan et al. reported the protein structure on pAPN by SWISS-MODEL web server (Shan et al., 2015). They reported pAPN contains small intra-cellular domain and large extra cellular domain divided into 3 subdomains named SPA, SPB and SPC.",

It has been established that TGEV binds the pAPN receptor on the surface of swine enterocytes (Delmas et al., 1992, Delmas et al., 1994). Additionally, TGEV along with CCoV, TGEV and HCoV-229E exhibit cross-binding activities to feline APN (fAPN), which is the major receptor for feline infectious peritonitis virus and it has been demonstrated that these viruses can utilize this receptor to infect fAPN-expressing BHK21 and NIH3T3 cells (Tresnan et al., 1996, Tusell and Holmes, 2006, Tusell et al., 2007). PEDV was also reported to interact with pAPN in porcine enterocytes (Li et al., 2009), and is capable of infecting MDCK and ST cells expressing the pAPN receptor (Oh et al., 2003, Nam and Lee, 2010). More recently, Li et al. reported pAPN is important receptor for PEDV infection in swine small intestine (IECs). They found higher expression increased the susceptibility by PEDV, and this was confirmed by siRNA inhibition results. They also found PEDV enters via apical plasma membrane and released from there in polarized epithelial cells (Cong et al., 2015). Other group reported that porcine and human APN serve as efficient receptor for PEDV infection (Li, 2015). They found although TGEV Spike protein bound porcine APN much more tightly than human APN, PEDV Spike protein efficiently bound both porcine and human APN. They also reported that Neu5Ac as the PEDV coreceptor. Very recently, Shirato et al. reported pAPN is not functional receptor for PEDV but promotes the its infection through protease activity (Shirato et al., 2016). Taken together it is acceptable that pAPN as the PEDV receptor still little bit controversial.",

Curiously, TGEV readily infects porcine primary cells whereas attempts to isolate PEDV in both primary and secondary fetal porcine cells have not been successful (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988, Kusanagi et al., 1992). This ambiguity is further compounded by the fact that Vero cells, with no surface pAPN, are susceptible to PEDV (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988). To clarify these doubts, the current study employed the NIH3T3 cells which are non-susceptible to PEDV infection. By constitutive expression of pAPNwt on these cells, the receptor function would be established by the conversion of the cells into a susceptible cell line (NIH3T3-pAPNwt).",

Whether this surface receptor would allow PEDV entry was investigated by infection of the cells along with experimental controls, NIH3T3wt and empty vector harboring cells (NIH3T3pcDNA3.0). Results of our analyses showed that although cytopathic effects such as cell rounding and or syncytia formation were not vividly evident, PEDV antigens were detectable immunocytochemistry. In addition, the number of foci formation was positively correlated with the virus titer and the time allowed for virus replication. This development could only be attributed to the pAPNwt because the wild type NIH3T3 and NIH3T3pcDNA3.0 cells were not permissive to PEDV infection. Since NIH3T3 cells being fibroblasts, have a morphology that may not allow close association between cells, spaces in between cells may have resulted in the lack of syncytia or plaque formation in NIH3T3. In addition, PEDV has already been adapted to Vero cells and it is assumable that NIH3T3 may be an unfamiliar environment for PEDV replication. Indeed, even new isolates of PEDV are able to show distinct signs of CPE in Vero cells only after several passages (Pan et al., 2010), which could probably be an adaptation period.",

They found MDCK cells expressing only SPC region successfully infected by PEDV and even shown cytopathic effects (CPE). They also reported that PEDV titer in MDCK cell expressing only SPC region generated same number of virus in pAPN expressing MDCK and Vero cells. In our study, to determine the specific interactive point of pAPNwt with PEDV, domain mutants were expressed stably in NIH3T3 cells. The cloning strategy of the mutants followed cues that coronaviruses identify certain intermittent motifs on fAPN which are amino acids (aa) 288\u2013290, aa 732\u2013746 (called R1), and aa 764\u2013788 (called R2) which determine their tropism (Tusell et al., 2007). Thus, two mutants; (David and Kathryn, 2007) expressing domains I\u2013VI of pAPNwt and (Susan and Navas-Martin, 2005) expressing domain VII of pAPNwt were constructed and designated pAPND1-VI and pAPNDVII, respectively. NIH3T3 stable cell lines expressing these mutants were assayed for their susceptibility to PEDV and similar to TGEV (Delmas et al., 1994), PEDV successfully infected pAPNDVII expressing cells but that was abrogated in the absence of the seventh domain (pAPNDI-VI). Also noteworthy, PEDV harvested from NIH3T3-pAPNwt and NIH3T3-pAPNDVII induced plaques on Vero cell monolayers indicating virus entry and propagation in those cells. Taken together, all our data confirmed that PEDV replicated in both NIH3T3-pAPNwt and NIH3T3-pAPNDVII suggesting successful entry into the cell lines. We therefore concluded that domain VII of pAPN is critical for PEDV entry. Although structural domain analysis on pAPN used in this study is little bit different from those from Shan et al. study, but functional binding domain from both studies are identical. Especially, our results promising because we studied stable expression of wild type and deletion mutants from stable cell lines expressing those proteins. Even if our studies confirmed with stable cell lines but still don\u2019t know how those mutations on pAPN affected on its stability, 3-D structure and especially function. Still more studies required to answer on those questions.",
