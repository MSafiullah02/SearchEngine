            "text": "Cryptosporidiosis is a common enteric infection of mammals, including domestic and wild animals, and humans (Tzipori and Widmer, 2008). The infection is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and the extreme robustness of the oocysts, the infective stage of Cryptosporidium parasites, accounts for the importance of indirect transmission through ingestion of contaminated water and food (Smith et al., 2006). In humans, cryptosporidiosis is mainly due to Cryptosporidium hominis, a species with a predominant anthroponotic cycle, and to Cryptosporidium parvum, a zoonotic species with a significant impact on young ruminants (Cacci\u00f2 et al., 2005, Xiao, 2010). C. hominis is the species responsible for the majority of human cases in the United States, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, while C. parvum accounts for more human cases in Europe and particularly in the United Kingdom (Chako et al., 2010).",

To date, only a modest number of specimens from sheep have been subgenotyped using this approach, and this has shown the presence of two families, known as IIa and IId (D\u00edaz et al., 2010). The IIa family is commonly found in livestock, and the subtypes identified in sheep are also found in calves (Qu\u00edlez et al., 2008, D\u00edaz et al., 2010, Smith et al., 2010), and some have been associated with infection in humans (Table 1\n). On the contrary, the family IId is strongly associated with lambs, at least in Spain (Qu\u00edlez et al., 2008), and with goat kids in Europe (Geurden et al., 2008, Qu\u00edlez et al., 2008, Drumo et al., 2012).",

The infection in lambs was particularly severe, with a mortality rate close to 80%, and the parasite was the only pathogen identified, as tests for both bacteria and viruses were negative. The analysis of fecal samples collected from lambs after the outbreak indicated that two genotypes, IIaA20G2R1 and IIaA15G2R1, were present in the farm. It should be noted that the IIaA20G2R1 subtype has been previously identified only in neonatal calves in Northern Ireland (Thompson et al., 2007), but not in humans or in other animals. This findings, together with the timing in the onset of symptoms, i.e., first in animals and then in the child, strongly suggest that the child acquired the infection from oocysts shed by the infected lambs. However, transmission must have been indirect, as the children had no contact with the infected animals, and could have resulted from an accidental exposure to oocysts carried by his father on working clothes. Interestingly, the child was excreting oocysts even after the regression of symptoms, albeit in much lower number, but no transmission occurred among other family members.",
