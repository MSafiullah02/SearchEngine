The 97 RNA samples representing cases of undiagnosed respiratory diseases were employed as a template for cDNA synthesis by use of Superscript II kits with random hexamer priming (Invitrogen), and they were analyzed by MassTag PCR by using a viral primer panel [27] that targeted influenza virus A and B (FLUAV and FLUBV, respectively), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV-A and RSV-B, respectively), human parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4 (HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV-4, respectively), human coronavirus 229E and OC-43 (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, respectively), human metapneumovirus, entero- and rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses. The fidelity of the MassTag PCR signal was verified by reamplification of products and by sequence analysis for all positive specimens. In instances in which MassTag PCR indicated the presence of a picornavirus, the VP4/VP2 region was amplified [37]. Amplification products were purified from agarose gels (Qia Gel Extraction Kit; Qiagen), and nucleotidesequencing reactions were performed on both strands by use of the ABI Prism Big Dye cycle sequencing kits and the ABI Prism Genetic Analyzer systems (Applied Biosytems). Identical results were obtained with duplicate aliquots processed at the New York and Berlin laboratories. Sequence analyses, alignments, and phylogenetic reconstructions were performed by use of programs from the Wisconsin GCG Package (Accelrys) and by MEGA3.1 software [38].

Picornaviruses represented the majority of identified viruses in each season (table 1). For purposes of molecular identification, nucleic-acid sequences were obtained from all specimens that MassTag PCR had identified as being positive for virus. We identified 3 cases of human adenovirus (HAdV) infection\u20141 HAdV-B and 2 HAdV-C (table 1). In the case of the picornavirus-positive specimens, we identified, by use of molecular typing, 1 human enterovirus 68 (HEV-68), 8 HRV-A, and 3 HRV-B infections; the remaining 30 HRV sequences (HRV X) did not match with known HRV-A, HRV-B, or HEV sequences.",

MassTag PCR targets conserved sequences in the 5\u2032-untranslated region of entero- and rhinoviruses; thus, to facilitate phylogenetic analysis of HEV and HRV, we amplified and sequenced the VP4/VP2 gene region. However, when we used the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for analysis at the nucleotide level, we did not find, for 30 of the VP4/VP2 sequences, a significant match with HRV-A, HRV-B, or HEV sequences; analysis at the amino-acid level revealed homology to enteroand rhinoviral sequences, with a sequence identity of 60%\u201365%. High similarity at both the nucleotide- and amino-acid levels was evident when sequences were aligned with an unclassified genetic clade of picornaviruses recently identified in New York State [30]. However, detailed phylogenetic analysis indicated significant sequence diversity among the 30 viruses (figure 1). Temporal analysis over 3 seasons indicated a lower frequency of the novel genotype during the 2003 season (20% [6/30]) compared with the 2004 (41% [11/27]) and 2005 (33% [13/40]) seasons; phylogenetic clustering by season was not obvious.

Although we did not have samples to test for the presence of HRV in the lower respiratory tract, the high frequency at which HRV was identified as being the sole virus detected suggests a correlation between the agent and the observed LRTI symptoms. Support for the plausibility of HRV being pathogenic in LRTI comes from the facts that (1) in situ hybridization has demonstrated that HRVs exist in lower airways and (2) HRVs have been shown to trigger inflammatory processes in the infected cells and tissues [5\u20137, 45\u201348].",

            "text": "Among the HRVs identified in the present study were representatives of the novel genetic clade recently discovered in New York State [30]; indeed, these viruses comprised the majority of HRVs detected. HRV-A and HRV-B have been implicated in common colds as well as in severe LRTI. In our patients, viruses of the novel genetic clade were also associated with a wide range of diseases, ranging from rhinitis to bronchitis to severe pneumonia, necessitating supplemental oxygen in \u223c50% of cases. A seasonal pattern of HRV infections has been described [2, 3, 43]; however, data regarding either serotype- or genotype-specific patterns of seasonality or disease symptoms are limited [49\u201351]. A temporal trend of sequence diversity or of correlation between genotype (within the novel HRV clade) and clinical diagnosis was not apparent in our data (figure 1).",

This clade may account, in part, for earlier reports of nontypeable rhinoviruses [41, 44]. Indeed, its discovery may reflect the implementation of new technologies rather than novelty of the agent itself. We anticipate that future work will define more than 1 serogroup. Our findings reinforce other groups' recent work indicating the significance of HRVs in pediatric LRTI. The presence of novel HRVs in 2 disparate geographic locations, in association with serious respiratory disease in children as well as in adults, mandates further work in epidemiology and pathogenesis.",
