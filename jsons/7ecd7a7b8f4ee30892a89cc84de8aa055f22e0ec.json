            "text": "The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 , caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already created emergency situations in almost every country of the world. The disease spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreaks starts on 2 nd March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of the disease also make it difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. We consider the initial phase of the outbreak situation in India and our proposed model is fitted to the daily cumulative new reported cases during the period 2 nd March, 2020 to 24 th March, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), effective reproduction number (R(t)) and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We further assess the effect of preventive measures such as spread of awareness, lock-down, proper hand sanitization, etc. in reducing the new cases. Two intervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the intervention strength over the period of implementation. Our study suggests that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the strength of the intervention should be strengthened over the time to eradicate the disease effectively.",

Our model (2.1) is simulated for 210 days to observe the dynamics of the disease in the absence of any intervention, using the in-built function ode45 in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2014a). From Fig. 5 , we see that the number new cases grows exponentially and attains the maximum at the end of the June. It is also observed that maximum of 26.3593 million new cases can occur in the absence of any intervention during the period (see Table 2 ). However, in the subsequent time, decreasing trend in the new cases is noted. Now we study the efficiency of the intervention by varying the strength of the intervention (k). Regarding the initiation of the control, we follow the same date when Govt. of India implemented nation-wide lock down i.e 25 th March, 2020. Throughout the study we consider this date as the initial date of implementing the intervention.",

The peak of the outbreak is shifted to the end of the month July. In this case, maximum 19.7233 million new cases can occur (see Table 2 ). If the strength of the intervention is increased further (for k = 0.40), the peak of the outbreak decreases and the occurrence of the peak shifted to the end of September (see Fig. 5 ). In this case, the maximum number new cases in a single day reduces to 11.2784 million (see Table 2 ). Now we consider the higher values of intervention strength. For k = 0.75, the new cases tend to decrease within a week (see Fig. 5 ) from the date of implementation and in such a case maximum of 102 new cases can occur (see Table 2 ). If the strength is increased further (i.e for k = 0.85 and 0.95) we see that the disease can be effectively eradicated within 1 to 2 months from the initial date of implementing intervention (see Fig. 5 ). Table 2 . Next we evaluate the maximum number of new cases during the time period 2 nd March, 2020 to 27 th September, 2020 for different values of k (see Fig. 7 ). The actual number of maximum new cases for different values of k are tabulated in Table 2 . The percentage of relative reduction in the final cumulative new cases for different k is presented in Fig. 8 . It is observed that interventions having lower strengths(i.e for k \u2208 [0.1, 0.4]), can reduce up to 54.6% final cumulative cases. However, if the strength of the intervention is considered to be higher then almost 99.8% reduction in the final cumulative cases can be achieved. ",

However, when the value of k is decreased further in the third window, the new cases tend to increase rapidly. This implies that the relaxation in the interventions strategy over the time does not end up with the disease eradication. Next we consider the opposite case i.e we increase the value of k from first window to third window. The values of k are taken as 0.3, 0.65 and 0.8 respectively in the respective time windows. It is observed from Fig. 10 that the new cases tends to increase in the first two windows. However, in the third window where the value of k is high enough, the new tend to decrease. This essentially implies that the intervention should be strengthened over the time to eradicate the disease effectively. ",

We considered the initial phase of outbreak of the disease COVID-19 in India and fitted our proposed model to the cumulative new reported cases during the period 2 nd March, 2020 to 24 th March, 2020. Some model parameters are estimated by fitting our model to the cumulative new reported cases during the above mentioned period. By looking at the estimated parameters, it is observed that the rate of disease transmission is quite high which basically implies the high infectiousness of the disease. The percentage of the symptomatic individuals coming from exposed individuals is estimated to be more than 52%, whereas the percentage of the asymptomatic and quarantined individuals are estimated as more than 27% and 20% respectively. This indicates that the contribution of the asymptomatic population to COVID-19 cases in India is not negligible.",

This high value of R 0 basically captures the outbreak scenario in India. The effective reproduction number (R(t)) provides information about the severity of COVID-19 over different time points. In our study, the values of R(t) lie between 2 and 6 most of the time. This is also confirms high transmissibility of the disease. The epidemic doubling time is also estimated to be approximately 3.34 days. This suggests that the rate of disease transmission need to be controlled otherwise a large proportion will be affected within a very short period of time",

We basically considered the preventive measures such as lock-down, spreading of awareness program through media, proper hand sanitization, etc. which slow down the disease transmissibility. Two intervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the intervention strength over the period of implementation. In the first scenario, we fixed the strength of the intervention throughout the period of implementation and studied the impact of intervention for different level of intervention efforts. In this scenario, our study reveals that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time. In the second scenario, the whole implementation time are divided into three time windows and in each of the window, the intervention strength is taken to be different. In such a scenario, our analysis shows that the strength of the intervention should not be relaxed over the time rather the intervention should be strengthened to eradicate the disease effectively. Designing the efficient intervention strategy is one of the crucial factor to curb the disease spread in an outbreak situation. In this regard, our study suggests that strict intervention should be implemented by the Government in the subsequent period of this outbreak. We believe that the findings obtained from this study can provide fruitful insights in framing policies regarding the control of COVID-19 in India.",
