            "text": "Human behavior, social networks, and the civil infrastructures are closely intertwined. Understanding their co-evolution is critical for designing public policies and decision support for disaster planning. For example, human behaviors and day to day activities of individuals create dense social interactions that are characteristic of modern urban societies. These dense social networks provide a perfect fabric for fast, uncontrolled disease propagation. Conversely, people's behavior in response to public policies and their perception of how the crisis is unfolding as a result of disease outbreak can dramatically alter the normally stable social interactions. Effective planning and response strategies must take these complicated interactions into account. In this chapter, we describe a computer simulation based approach to study these issues using public health and computational epidemiology as an illustrative example. We also formulate game-theoretic and stochastic optimization problems that capture many of the problems that we study empirically.",

Certain aspects of this change arise from structural adaptations such as reciprocity, transitivity, etc. However, changes in social networks also occur as a result of the behavior of individual agents comprising the network. Conversely, individual characteristics and behaviors can depend on the social network to which the agent belongs. For example, it is well known that in many social situations, the behavior of individual agents mimics those of other agents with whom they interact. In other words, individual behaviors and social networks co-evolve. Examples include fashion trends in schools, market practices of firms based on strategies used by successful firms, etc. Social scientists often refer to the change in network structure as selection [22] [23] [24] , and change in individual characteristics as influence [17, 23, 24] . See [1, 7, 2, 9, 8, 10, 11, 33, 18] for work done at the interface of game theory, network formation and individual behavior. We also refer the reader to the work of [12, 29, 30] for theoretical as well as empirical research on the subject of treating selection and influence processes in a network simultaneously.",

Furthermore, we also consider another component that affects this dynamic-public policy. In classical models used in computational epidemiology, individuals do not adapt their contact behavior during epidemics. For example, they do not endogenously engage in social distancing (protective sequestration) based on disease prevalence. Rather, they simply continue mixing (often uniformly) as if no epidemic were under way. Although potentially a reasonable assumption for non-lethal infections such as the common cold, it is known to fail for lethal diseases such as AIDS. People may be expected to adapt their contact patterns when they perceive a potential threat due to the onset of avian influenza. This will likely result in substantial changes in the social networks that in turn will alter epidemic dynamics. In other words, individual behaviors and the social contact networks that they generate interact and co-evolve. For brevity we will call the problem of coevolution of Public policy, Individual behavior and interaction Network as the PIN problem for the rest of the chapter.",

In the event of an influenza pandemic, changes in the structure of the social contact network due to behavioral changes are the most important yet difficult to predict factors in determining the spread.

            "text": "Policy planning has been a central focus of epidemiological research over the years. In addition to empirical observations, practitioners have relied on mathematical models for understanding and comparing different public health policies and making recommendations. These models involve stochastic disease processes on social contact networks. Due to computational considerations, most work in epidemiological modeling has focused on static social networks. However, social networks change quite a bit during an epidemic. For instance, policies put in place by public health authorities such as school closures, quarantine, and face masks cause significant changes to the social network. Equally important though is the role of individual behavior in transforming the social network. The recent SARS epidemic (2003) served as an excellent example of how both these factors changed the social network. Thus, mathematical methods for analyzing epidemics based on models of static social contact networks are unlikely to give practical insights into the spread of diseases. We illustrate the issues by two examples. EXAMPLE 1. First, a simple yet important decision faced by millions of people throughout the country every day during cold and flu season: should I go to work today, even though I have symptoms of a cold or flu? The immediate economic impact of absenteeism due to colds and influenza in the United States in 1980 is estimated to have been $6.5 Billion [31] . While some fraction of these infections arise from exposure outside the workplace, many and perhaps the majority occur because a co-worker decided the consequences of possibly transmitting the disease were less important than the certain consequences of staying home. Indeed, the term presenteeism has been coined to describe the problem.",

Society pressures us in many ways to go to work even when we may be sick: lack of paid sick leave, need to complete tasks, fear of being seen as a malingerer, desire to be perceived as critical to an organization's success, etc. Personal interactions with co-workers can influence the decision either way. The influence co-workers exert may be tied to whether they have themselves been sick. Furthermore, when a person chooses to stay home, it affects the social network at work in at least two different ways: one is simply the removal of the sick person as an active influence in decision-making (note that this biases the influence of the remaining people by removing precisely those who would argue for staying home); the other, more subtle, effect is a change in the probability that co-workers will be infected, and thus a possible change in their influence on the decision. EXAMPLE 2. A second example is the individual decision whether and when to flee in the face of a crisis. As recent mass evacuations have clearly shown, we do not know the best way to clear people out of a city. Much of the uncertainty stems from poor understanding of the effects of individual decisions on the process. How is a person's decision to leave related to official evacuation orders and to decisions made by social contacts? How does it relate to the perceived congestion in the transportation system? How will a household prepare to evacuate and how long will preparations take? What additional demands will be placed on the transportation system as geographically dispersed households gather? How can we take advantage of existing mass transportation resources? How do all these choices depend on timing of an official announcement?",

When the disease has high transmissibility (\u03c4 = 0.0003) vaccination policies have little effect (Fig. 18.3) : even if half a million vaccinations are given (5.6% of the population) there is only a 7% decrease in epidemic size (6.3% of the population). If these vaccines were not randomly assigned, but specifically given to people older than 60 then they are even less effective, only decreasing the epidemic size by 5.1% which is even lower than the vaccination percentage (5.6%). The effect is only slightly greater for less transmissible diseases: with \u03c4 = 0.000048 the epidemic is decreased by 8%. The limited effect of vaccinating those over 60 is a result of the low connectivity of this population.

Additionally, active individuals, who engage in many types of activities (i.e. school, work, and/or college) or live with an individual with these activities, may be relatively easy to identify.

This experiment studies the effectiveness of a collection of interventions both together and in isolation as well as the sensitivity of when they are implemented. The interventions are dynamically triggered at different points in the epidemic and the timing of these triggers is also studied. The interventions are designed to reduce the opportunities for infections by removing infectious people from circulation, reducing their infectivity through treatment, and keeping potentially infectious people from transmitting disease before they develop symptoms.

This more flexible architecture allows the exploration of a wider range of public health policy options, and can reproduce behaviors in the system that may not be obvious. The transparency in the representation of the framework also allows for a more direct interpretation of the results, which allows for greater understanding across a wider audience of policy makers.

Similarly, an infected node u spreads the infection to each neighbor v, independent of the other neighbors of u.

This is especially true in the case of vaccinations, which may have side effects and involve additional costs, and in the case of directives to \"stay home\", might simply be infeasible. Incentives are needed to make people comply. An interesting way to give an incentive could be to enter all the people who get vaccinated into a lottery-such schemes have also been studied in other settings, such as voting. This scenario immediately leads to interesting game theoretic questions, since each individual now has a set of conflicting costs and rewards, and has to make a choice that would optimize his or her perceived utility. There are several papers that study game theoretic questions [1, 7, 9] related to epidemics on networks. However, these results either assume that the graph is very simple, or that the disease model is very simple. The approaches in [7, 9] use differ-ential equations and mean field approximations to formulate realistic disease models on complete mixing networks (cliques). The paper by Aspnes, Chang and Yampolskiy [1] is much closer to our models, in the sense that the network is general, but the disease model is simple and assumes a \"highly contagious disease\". Extensions of this game have been studied in [26, 25] . There are, admittedly, several difficulties with these non-cooperative formulations, e.g., it is hard for nodes to compute their utility functions, and there is no persuasive reason for equilibria to exist. However, the structure of these games may give useful insights into their dynamics. We also give equivalent dynamical system formulations of these games. (VG) This game is denoted by VG(G,r,\u03c4 ,\u012a,x), and is defined in the following manner. Each node corresponds to a player, and a strategy for player v is denoted by a quantity a v \u2208 [0, 1], which is the probability that node v decides to get vaccinated; vaccinating a node is equivalent to lowering the infection probabilities on all edges incident on v. The disease model is specified by\u012a,r and\u03c4 , andx gives the initial conditions, as discussed earlier. We formulate the utility function U v for node v as",

Finally, the cost of the worst Nash equilibrium can be \u0398(n) times The Multi Stage Policy Game (MSPG): While the above questions are mathematically interesting, an inherent difficulty with the above model is that it is hard for individuals to estimate their costs. In light of this, we will consider the following multi-stage version of this problem. We call this the Multi Stage Policy Game (MSPG), and it is denoted by MSPG(G,r,\u03c4 ,\u012a,x). In this game, the strategy a v of player v is actually a vector, and a v (i) denotes the probability that v stays home-people find it much easier to decide whether to stay home or not, when an outbreak has started, than deciding the utility of getting vaccinated. Node v can choose a v (i) depending on how many nodes in its neighborhood are infected. The main objective would be to study this as a dynamical system and explore its limit distribution, and the parameters that influence these distributions. Preliminary empirical results related to this problem can be found in [13] . A simpler variation of the above based on differential equations was formulated and studied in [21] . The model proposed here is more general and network based which makes the problem substantially harder. The MSPG and VPG games are instances of anti-coordination games [8] -it is in the interest of a player to get vaccinated or stay home if a lot of people around her are not doing so. The realism in the contact network and disease model make this a very rich problem area. In addition to the limiting distributions of these games, the computational complexity of these problems is an interesting problem.",

The computational complexity of these problems is in general an open question.As an example, we consider the VP and AVP problems and their computational variants. The complexity of computing the expected number of infected nodes, N inf , for initial conditionsx, when set S i of nodes is vaccinated at step i, is not exactly known. As mentioned in [20] , it is not known how to compute this quantity, even when all the nodes to be vaccinated are chosen in step 1 itself, though it is a reasonable conjecture that this problem is #P-hard. An ( , \u03b4) approximation to N inf can be computed by a simple sampling scheme:1. For i = 1 to t do (a) Generate a random instance of the bond percolation process, by retaining each edge with probability r (e), as defined earlier in the discussion of the AVP problem. (b) Let Z i denote the number of nodes reachable from the initial infected nodes, specified byx. ",
