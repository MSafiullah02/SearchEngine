The study of Liao X, et al. recommended the use of NEWS plus age scoring system for disease change recognition in patients with COVID-19, and provided guidance for the triage of patients with COVID-19. 4 This study shows that the ability of NEWS plus age to predict the deterioration of patients admitted to COVID-19 is good as NEWS. Although further studies with large sample size are needed to evaluate the prediction ability of NEWS on the deterioration of patients with COVID-19, this J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f study still provides a good reference for clinical application of NEWS. By monitoring the vital signs of patients, early and accurate identification of the deterioration of patients admitted to COVID-19 can not only improve the prognosis of patients, but also reduce the burden of medical staff in a tense medical environment.
