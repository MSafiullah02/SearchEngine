            "text": "\nSubtilisin-like pro-protein convertases (PCs) are the major endoproteolytic processing enzymes that mediate the biosynthesis of a great variety of secreted and membrane proteins. These proteins processed by PCs are involved in embryogenesis, gene expression, cell cycle, programmed cell death, intracellular protein targeting, and endocrine/neural functions (Zhou et al., 1999, Muller et al., 2004). These precursor molecules need to undergo a series of processing steps that involve multiple processing enzymes (Posthaus et al., 2003, Chan et al., 1992). The multi-protein family of mammalian serine proteases is responsible for these proteolytic maturation events. They are expressed together or separately in functional cells from both vertebrates and invertebrates. The mammalian PCs have been demonstrated to be involved in several diseases, i.e. HIV, hepatitis B, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), anthrax, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, stroke, glaucoma, and diabetes (Seidah and Prat, 2002, Thomas, 2002, Khatib et al., 2002, Taylor et al., 2003, Molloy et al., 1999, Leak et al., 2007).",

Tanaka (2003) and Sang-Nam et al. (2007) reported that mouse or rat proPC2 with 637 amino acid residues (74 kDa) cleaves into mature PC2 with 529 amino acid residues (64 kDa) in adequate conditions, such as 5.0 pH, higher Ca2+, and other PCs. There is about 96.55% identity between human and mouse PC2, or 99.53% identity between mouse and rat PC2 in amino acid sequence (Smeekens and Steiner, 1990, Seidah et al., 1991, Manser et al., 1990). Fricker et al. (1989) and Hakes et al. (1991) reported that the human and rat proCPE protein sequence with 476 amino acid residues (56 kDa) are highly conserved (99.58% identity between them). The mature CPE protein is about 50 kDa. The soluble CPE (sCPE) is an exo-peptidase that cleaves neuroendocrinopeptide with C-terminal basic amino acid residue and produces active form of peptide hormone and neuropeptide (Fricker and Snyder, 1983, Hook and Loh, 1984). The membrane-bound CPE (mCPE) functions as a sorting receptor in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). It facilitates the sorting of pro-hormones into the regulated secretary pathway (Zhu et al., 2005, Dhanvantari et al., 2003). Brakch et al. (1997) and Miller et al. (2003) reported that the maturation of NPY precursor needed the presence of PC2 and CPE.",

Proteins (50 \u03bcg per gel lane) were fractionated by SDS\u2013PAGE (150 V for 2 h), blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore Co., USA) (166 mA for 2.5 h), and probed with an appropriate primary antibody. The antibody bound to the membrane was detected with the enzyme-catalyzed chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Pierce Co.). The membrane was cut for ECL according to the molecular weights of the detected proteins. To verify the equality of protein loadings among different samples to be compared, the blotted membrane was detected with \u03b2-actin antibody as control. Rabbit antiserum against proPC2 (amino acids 611\u2013638, diluted in 1:1000) (donated by Dr. An Zhou) or antibodies against preproNPY (amino acids 68\u201397, diluted in 1: 2000) and CPE (diluted in 1:2000) were used.

NPY molecule is one of the most abundant peptides found in the mammalian tissue (Chronwall et al., 1985, De Quidt and Emson, 1986). Its maturation is subjected to the processing of PC2 and CPE. preproNPY has 97 amino acid residues in mouse and human, 98 amino acid residues in rat. The isoelectric point (pI) of preproNPY is 11.1. The Western blot result of preproNPY peptide indicated that its specific band on SDS\u2013PAGE was close to 17 kDa, which is because the higher pI of the peptide formed a larger molecule by combining with more SDS molecule. The electric mobility is very similar with the GHRH analogs we ever reported (Tang et al., 2004). In the study on PC2 activity, the leupeptin in the Berman buffer strongly inhibits PC2 activity and there is lower PC2 activity in the tumor cells.

As long as intracellular proNPY protein occurs, the strong PC2/CPE-mediated processing system processes the precursor into NPY, whereas the weak PC2/CPE-mediated pro-protein processing level in the tumor tissues or cells leads to the aggregations of proCPE and preproNPY proteins. In the research the cell or tissue ICC results collaborated with the Western blot ones. We predict that there is a weak or uneven PCs system in tumor. The microenvironment formed in tumor was different from normal mature tissue. So the profile of tumor may result from not only up- or down-regulation(s) of component(s), but also the difference of the construct ratio of the functional molecules in tumor tissue should be considered.
