The studies on the immunity of shrimp and other crustaceans have mainly focused on general aspects of immunity and as a consequence little is known about the antiviral responses in crustaceans. The aim of this review is to update recent knowledge of innate immunity against viral infections in crustaceans. Several antiviral molecules have been isolated and characterized recently from decapods. Characterization and identification of these molecules might provide a promising strategy for protection and treatment of these viral diseases.

Hence, viral infections are common diseases in crustaceans such as penaeid shrimp, which can be infected by more than twenty different viruses [2] . In crustaceans, research on viruses has increased considerably since the first report on the occurrence of a virus in the crab Macropipus depurator [3] . Crustacean viruses belong to or are related to various viral families like the Baculoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Herpesviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Togaviridae, Iridoviridae or a new virus family, the Nimaviridae [4] . During the past decades, both extensive and intensive shrimp cultures have been established and as a result more detailed knowledge of viral-host interactions has been gained. Among these viruses, the most intensively studied viruses have been characterized from cultured penaeids such as the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), yellow head virus (YHV), and Taura syndrome virus (TSV). Much less details are available for other viruses present in wild crustaceans [5] . Infection with these viruses has caused detrimental diseases in shrimp culturing, resulting in serious economic losses. WSSV, YHV, and TSV have been regarded as the most serious shrimp viruses ( Fig. 1 ) [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 144, "end": 147, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 293, "end": 296, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 447, "end": 450, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 698, "end": 701, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1169, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1379, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1367, "end": 1373, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Crustacean viruses"}, {"text": "WSSV is an enveloped large circular double stranded DNA virus containing about 300 Kbp [7, 8] .

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that WSSV is a new virus family named as the Nimaviridae, genus Whispovirus. WSSV has been widely studied and here we mainly focus on the interaction between this virus and its decapod hosts. The WSSV has a wide host range including all species of shrimps, some other crustaceans (e.g. crayfish, crab, and spiny lobster), and has even been detected in insects (Fig. 2) [10] and can be transmitted from broodstock to the offspring [11] . After infection, the shrimp exhibits very high mortality rates and the cumulative mortality usually reaches 100% within 3-10 days after the onset of the first visible gross signs.

Most cells are capable of endocytosis through several distinct mechanisms including clathrin-coated vesicles, phagocytosis, macropinocytosis and caveolae [27] . Several animal viruses take advantage of the cell endocytic machinery for a successful infection. In this process, viruses are taken up into the cytoplasm, where they produce dsRNA and initiate replication. The incoming virus particles are entering endosomal structures, lysozymes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and occasionally the Golgi complex. The mildly acidic pH in the endosome will trigger penetration and uncoating. During this process, cytoskeleton and cellular proteins are often recruited by the invading viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus entry"}, {"text": "How invertebrate viruses enter host cells remains largely unknown. Coronaviruses have been suggested to use envelope proteins as recognition molecules for viral-host binding and cell entry [28] . This is also supported by an in vitro study showing that a polyclonal antibody against gp116 (YHV glycoprotein 116) inhibited YHV entry into LO cells, but not an antibody to gp64 (YHV glycoprotein 116) [29] . YRP65 has been identified as a YHV receptor in Penaeus monodon. Both antibodies against YRP65 and silencing of the YRP65 are able to specifically inhibit the entry of the YHV into the Oka or lymphoid organ cells [18] . PmRab7, a shrimp small GTPase protein binding directly to VP28 of WSSV, was suggested to be involved in WSSV infection [30] . Silencing of PmRab7 dramatically inhibited WSSV-VP28 RNA and protein expression. Future work is still necessary to elucidate if this PmRab7 localizes on the surface of the host cells and how this protein is involved in virus transport into the cells. Further, the silencing of PmRab7 also inhibited YHV replication in the YHV-infected shrimp. These data indicate that PmRab7 is a common cellular factor required for WSSV or YHV replication in shrimp [31] . However, in a latter study, some shrimp injected with dsRNA did not show any antiviral protection and some of the RT-PCR results of host gene/viral gene are not in agreement with each other in the quantitation of their transcripts. Thus, the data presented in this study may need more detailed investigations for a fully understanding of the mechanism by which PmRab7 interacts with WSSV. Besides, another Rab GTPase from Penaeus japonicus was reported to regulate shrimp hemocytic phagocytosis through a proposed protein complex consisting of the PjRab, beta-actin, tropomyosin, and an envelope protein VP466 of WSSV, indicating a possible role of phagocytosis involved in virus evasion in shrimp [32] .

Peroxinectin, a cell adhesive and opsonic peroxidase, has been shown to mediate attachment and spreading of the hemocytes in crayfish. This molecule can also trigger degranulation by a regulated exocytosis [36, 37] . Binding of peroxinectin to the cell surface via an extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) may produce a signal into the cell through an integrin for further cellular responses [38] . The cellular responses have been suggested to be triggered via a pathway that includes protein kinase C (PKC) activation and elevated protein tyrosine phosphorylation of a cellular protein of w80 kDa [39] . Hemocyte lysate supernatant (HLS) containing peroxinectin treated GCs and SGCs from WSSV-infected crayfish resulted in three different cell-reactions: non-spread, spread, and degranulated cells. The non-spread cell groups from both GCs and SGCs exhibited more WSSV positive cells than the degranulated cells. Taken these data together, it is likely that the PKC pathway might be somehow affected by WSSV during its replication within the cells [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 119, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 120, "end": 123, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 362, "end": 366, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 575, "end": 579, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 580, "end": 583, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 764, "end": 768, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 971, "end": 975, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1426, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Virus entry"}, {"text": "In crustaceans, the number of freely circulating hemocytes varies in response to environmental stress, endocrine activity during the moulting cycle, and infection.

WSSV affects the hemocytes in crayfish P. leniusculus. For instance, infection of WSSV has a significant effect on the proportion of different hemocyte types in the animals. The number of GCs was significantly higher in WSSV-injected crayfish compared to control animals [12] . Studies from crayfish and shrimp suggest that SGCs are more susceptible to WSSV and the virus replicates more rapidly in SGCs than GCs resulting in the gradually decreased SGCs from blood circulation [34, 35] . Other studies showed that the total numbers of circulating hemocytes in shrimp were dramatically decreased after infection by WSSV [41] [42] [43] . On the other hand, immune-relevant molecules from crustacean hemocytes are essential in defence against invasive pathogens [37, 44] . The data from recent studies also demonstrate that silencing of immunerelevant genes like anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) from crayfish hemocytes led to rapid infection of WSSV [45] . Therefore, immediate regeneration of hemocytes is critical for the survival of the animals against pathogenic intruders and hence the hematopoiesis, a process in which mature hemocytes are produced and subsequently released from the hematopoietic tissue, is therefore an important process during an infection with a microorganism.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 324, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 325, "end": 328, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 602, "end": 606, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 809, "end": 813, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 814, "end": 817, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 956, "end": 960, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 961, "end": 965, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1095, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1099, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1288, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral infection and hematopoiesis in crustaceans"}, {"text": "So far, little is known about hematopoiesis under a viral infection in crustaceans.

This study also indicated that the hemocytes were synthesized and partly differentiated in the Hpt, but the final differentiation into functional hemocytes was not completed until they were released into the circulation. Hematopoiesis is tightly regulated by the lineage restricted activity of various factors that promote cell diversification [47] [48] [49] . The hematopoietic tissue has been studied in several crustaceans, but the mechanisms for the release of blood cells into circulation in crustaceans are still unclear. The identification of three different proteins/transcripts can be used as markers/indicators for hematopoietic cell proliferation and specific differentiation into SGCs or GCs.

Interestingly, the crayfish ALF was up-regulated by a WSSV challenge and was shown to be involved in antiviral response against WSSV. Silencing of ALF specially resulted in higher rates of WSSV propagation both in the animals and in a cell culture of Hpt from crayfish. In contrast, enhanced expression of ALF in the animals by the administration of UVtreated WSSV led to lower viral replication and a partial protection against a subsequent challenge with the active virus [45] . ALF from shrimp was also up-regulated in Litopenaeus vannamei upon WSSV challenge [66] . Silencing of LvALF1 resulted in a significant increase of mortality in L. vannamei challenged by Vibrio penaeicida and Fusarium oxysporum indicating that LvALF1 has a role in protecting shrimp from both bacterial and fungal infections, but not to a WSSV infection even if it was up-regulated by WSSV infection [65] . This is different from crayfish ALF which showed antiviral property both in vivo and in vitro [45] . The mechanism for the antiviral activity of crayfish ALF is still unknown. Further studies have shown that recombinant ALFPm3, from shrimp P. monodon affected the viral infection by inhibiting the attachment of virus to the crayfish Hpt cells suggesting that ALF may act during the initial stages of virus entry to host cells (unpublished data). The mechanism of this inhibition still needs further investigations. A gene named as PmAV was found to be up-regulated in virus resistant shrimp and the PmAV protein has a C-type lectinlike domain (CTLD). Recombinant PmAV protein displayed a strong antiviral activity in inhibiting virus-induced cytopathic effect in fish cells in vitro. Further experiments showed that PmAV did not bind to the WSSV implying that the antiviral mechanism of this protein was not due to inhibition of the attachment of virus to target host cell [67] . A novel C-type lectin (LvCTL1) showed strong affinity to WSSV and interacted with several envelope proteins of WSSV. Binding of recombinant LvCTL1 to WSSV could protect the shrimp from viral infection and could delay the survival of shrimps against WSSV infection [68] . Besides, a beta-integrin was found to interact with a WSSV envelope protein VP187 containing the RGD motif. Soluble integrin, integrin-specific antibody and an RGD containing peptide could block the WSSV infection in vivo and in vitro. Silencing of beta-integrin efficiently inhibited the virus infection. These data suggest that this beta-integrin may function as a cellular receptor for WSSV infection [69] . Injection of recombinant shrimp fortilin followed by WSSV challenge resulted in decreased viral infection by an unknown mechanism in P. monodon [70] . A syntenin and its protein partner alpha-2-macroglobulin co-precipitated with each other and both of them were up-regulated in the acute-phase of a WSSV infection [71] . Hemocyanin, the respiratory protein of arthropods and molluscs, was found to exhibit non-specific antiviral properties [72] and to delay the infection of WSSV in vivo in P. japonicus [73] . Other host proteins like a chitin-binding protein [74] and actin microfilaments have been shown to interact with WSSV component proteins [75] . Some other genes have been found to be up-regulated as a response to WSSV infection in the animals, but no mechanistic studies have been performed.

When injected intramuscularly or administered orally with VP28, the shrimps obtained a higher and prolonged survival rates after WSSV challenge [85, 86] .

However, strong inactivation of WSSV by some normal rabbit sera was observed in a manner independent of anti-VP28 antibodies questioning the potential of anti-VP28 preimmune antibodies to specifically neutralize WSSV [96] . Thus, further investigations are necessary for the availability of these antibodies against different viral proteins.

For instance, Baculovirus contains p35 and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins [126] which can inhibit multiple caspases [127] [128] [129] . Besides, an increasing number of viruses are shown to induce apoptosis actively at late stages of infection.

Apoptosis has been considered to constitute a defence responsible for eliminating virus in naturally TSV infected shrimp [136] . However, other studies [132, 137] suggest that apoptosis cannot be taken as an effective protection against WSSV in shrimp. For example by knocking down caspase-3 by RNAi this reduces mortality in Pacific white shrimp challenged with a low dose of WSSV but not if a high-dose of WSSV is used. This suggests that apoptosis may increase rather than decrease mortality in WSSVchallenged shrimp [138] . Another study indicates that shrimp with gross signs of WSSV infection from shrimp farms exhibited up to 40% apoptotic cells, and it was suggested that apoptosis might be implicated in shrimp death [132] . Similarly, the widespread and progressive occurrence of apoptosis in P. monodon infected with YHV is a major cause of dysfunction and death of the host. YHVinfected cells show the signs of viral-triggered apoptosis like nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis [133] . The expression of ribophorin I was up-regulated and remained high until the moribund stage in YHV-infected shrimp [139] . Ribophorin I belongs to the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex involved in apoptosis [140] . Whereas, the transcriptional level of defender against apoptotic death 1 (DAD1), a negative regulator of apoptosis [141] , decreased dramatically after YHV challenge in P. monodon, suggesting that DAD1 plays a role in mortality caused by YHV [142] . A shrimp translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is an antiapoptotic protein which has been implied to play a key role in shrimp defence responses or in control over viral-triggered apoptosis [143] . Whereas a hepatopancreatic nuclease is shown unlikely to be involved in viral-triggered apoptosis in shrimp [144] . The DNA fragmentation for WSSV-infected shrimp is the possible result of WSSV nuclease activity rather than shrimp nuclease activity. WSSV nuclease was identified and clearly shown to be expressed in the hepatopancreas of WSSV-infected shrimp [145] . However, signs of endogenous apoptosis have been shown in the shrimp lymphoid organ without known viral infections [133, 136] . Thus, still quite a lot of controversy remains for the role of apoptosis in antiviral responses in crustaceans and this may be due to different species used for the assays, the big variations of animals, different experimental manipulations, etc. Besides, apoptosis is a complex process involving the interaction of many proteins. Few of these proteins have been characterized from crustaceans.

The RNAi technique is now explored as an alternative and more specific approach to counteract virus infections in shrimps. Injection of dsRNA/siRNA specific to viral genes can block viral disease progression. This effect has been confirmed with different unrelated viruses. For instance, viral replication was efficiently suppressed with injection of WSSV-specific dsRNA/siRNA targeting VP19, VP28, VP281, or WSSV protein kinase in penaeid shrimp [103, 160, 161] . Lower YHV replication was observed in shrimp primary cell cultures by transfecting the cells with dsRNA targeted to the viral nonstructural genes [162] .

It is a molecule that often forms during viral infection as a result of viral genomic replication and viral RNAs with extensive secondary structure [164] . In mammals, dsRNA is recognized by TLR3, which activates myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88)-dependent and an independent signal transduction cascade, resulting in expression of IFN-b [165, 166] . DsRNA can also induce antiviral responses intracellularly by directly activating PKR, which results in inhibition of cellular and viral protein synthesis via phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 a (eIF2a) [167] . Further, some of the components of the pro-apoptotic pathways (e.g. PKR, RNaseL, IFN regulatory factor 3, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase) can be activated by dsRNA [168] . Hence, dsRNA is involved in both signaling viral infection and inducing apoptosis. It has been generally agreed that these dsRNA-induced IFNs are lacking in invertebrates [169] [170] [171] . Recent studies reveal the existence of both innate (non-sequence specific) and RNAi related (sequence specific) antiviral phenomena in a crustacean model [103, 104, 107, 172] . But the protection induced by dsRNA could be overwhelmed by a higher dose (8-fold) of infectious virus, which means that sequence independent dsRNA induces quite a low induction of resistance to virus infection. The mechanism of this difference between higher and lower amount of infectious virus remains unknown. The protective efficiency for WSSV infection by specific dsRNAs is also varied between different viral genes targeted and no explanations have been addressed for these differences in this study. Other studies have shown that viral RNAs exhibit different sensitivities to RNAi attack [173] . This may results from protective proteins that bind to the viral RNA, or protective RNA structure because the viral RNA presents in a virus particle or a subcellular compartment that is not accessible to the RNAi machinery [173] . It remains unclear whether the antiviral protection by virus-specific long dsRNA is the result of RNAi mechanism alone or the combination of innate immune activation and RNAi in shrimp. Further, the readout from these studies was mainly based on the cumulative mortalities and no mechanism so far is available for these antiviral phenomena. Importantly, these studies suggest a possible evolutionary link (recognition of dsRNA) between innate antiviral immunity in invertebrates and vertebrates (Fig. 5) . DsRNAs have been implied as important regulators for gene expression [174, 175] . The distinction between self and non-self dsRNA is suggested by different structural features including 5 0 triphosphate, 3 0 protruding end or other specific motifs. Following the identification of RNA helicases, retinoic acid inducible gene-I, melanoma differentiation associated gene-5, and TLRs 7/8, more details will be elucidated on how different dsRNAs are selectively recognized by different sensors of the innate immune responses [168] .

We have succeeded in developing an Hpt cell culture from crayfish, which can be a useful tool for gene functional studies in crustaceans [46] . This Hpt cultures can also be used to replicate WSSV and to study host-virus interactions (Fig. 4) [176] .

Compared to other pharmacological interventions, RNAi is an attractive antiviral therapeutic because it allows interference with the target gene in a highly sequence-specific manner, and therefore essential viral genes can be targeted by design with little or no risk of unexpected off-target effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that the viral disease progression can be blocked by injecting shrimp with dsRNA/siRNA specific to viral genes. This strategy is effective against three unrelated viruses: WSSV, TSV and YHV [104, 105] . The mechanism for this phenomenon is still not clear. In these studies, positive strand RNA virus (e.g. TSV and YHV) and DNA virus (e.g. WSSV) often induce the formation of dsRNAs during their infectious cycles such as genomic replicative intermediates, intramolecular interactions within viral transcripts, and bi-directional transcription [178] . And these dsRNAs might engage the shrimp RNAi pathway, resulting in effective antiviral responses. Thus it will be of interest to investigate whether viral dsRNA accumulates in crustacean cells infected with WSSV, TSV, or YHV. Two components of RNA silencing, Argonaute and Dicer-1, have been characterized from P. monodon [179] [180] [181] . Based on the studies in crustaceans above, plants [149] , fruit flies [150] [151] [152] , mosquitoes [154] , and nematodes [155, 156] , it is likely that RNAi indeed exists as a natural antiviral mechanism in several organisms including crustaceans. These studies and further investigations of genes involved in RNAi in crustaceans should provide the possibility by reverse-genetic approaches to test this hypothesis directly. [107] . Viral dsRNA or extracellular dsRNA enters the RNAi pathway, and/or activates innate antiviral responses directly or indirectly. Signal transduction triggered by dsRNA recognition may regulate transcriptomic expression leading to antiviral reactions. These pathways may function independently as well as interact together to facilitate the antiviral responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 53, "text": "[173]", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 581, "end": 586, "text": "[104,", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 587, "end": 591, "text": "105]", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 935, "end": 940, "text": "[178]", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1271, "text": "[179]", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1277, "text": "[180]", "ref_id": "BIBREF179"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1283, "text": "[181]", "ref_id": "BIBREF180"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1341, "text": "[149]", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1361, "text": "[150]", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1367, "text": "[151]", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1373, "text": "[152]", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1392, "text": "[154]", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1414, "text": "[155,", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1419, "text": "156]", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1718, "text": "[107]", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding remarks"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Marine viruses and their biogeochemical and ecological effects", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Fuhrman", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1999, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "399", "issn": "", "pages": "541--549", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Viral pathogens of the penaeid shrimp", "authors": [{"first": "P", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Loh", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Tapay", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Lu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Nadala", "middle": [], "last": "Jr", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["C"], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1997, "venue": "Adv Virus Res", "volume": "48", "issn": "", "pages": "263--312", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "A virus disease in Crustacea", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Vago", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1966, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "209", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "White spot syndrome virus interaction with a freshwater crayfish.
