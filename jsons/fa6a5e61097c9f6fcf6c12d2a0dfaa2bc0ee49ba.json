In all of these locations, relevant and up to date knowledge of presentations, diagnoses, potential complications and clinical management will help the anesthetist and the surgical team, not only with the performance of their interventions, but also in buying time before these are undertaken, avoiding complications and altering the eventual outcome for the child. Diseases such as epiglottitis and diphtheria may show diminished incidence but they have not gone away and their clinical features and essential management remain unchanged. Paradoxically, perhaps, some conditions such as Lemierre's syndrome appear to be making a comeback. In these instances, clinicians need to be alert to these less common conditions, not only in regard to the disease itself but also to potentially serious complications. This article describes those infections of the airway that are most likely to present to the anesthetist, their attendant complications and recommendations for treatment.",

The retropharyngeal space contains loose connective tissue and lymph nodes that drain the nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, middle ear, teeth and adjacent bones. Retropharyngeal abscesses are more common in young children and this may be because lymph tissue in this area involutes and atrophies in older patients (13) . Most studies give a male to female ratio of nearly 2 : 1 (11, 14) and a median age of 32.5-36 months (15, 16) . The incidence of this condition appears to be markedly on the rise (15) . In a recent series covering 11 years (1995-2006) and 162 children with retropharyngeal abscesses, Page (11) noted a linearly rising incidence over the study period. Computed tomography was performed in 94% and had an accuracy of 68%. The principal symptoms were fever, sore throat, torticollis and neck pain. There was obstruction of the airway in only 8%. The commonest clinical signs were lymphadenopathy, local tenderness and limited range of movement. However, more specific findings were somewhat less common, e.g. pharyngeal bulge in 23% (Figure 3 ), tonsillar deviation in 12% and drooling in 10%.",

This paper described an evolving condition beginning with suppuration at the local site, followed by thrombophlebitis with septic emboli a later feature. No specificity was attributed to F. necrophorum but rather a recognition that the picture may be caused by normally saprophytic anaerobes, possibly working in synergy (26) , and indeed its growth may be promoted by coexisting aerobes (27) . The septicemic phase typically occurs 4-5 days after the onset of a sore throat or tonsillitis and is characterized by a rise in temperature and rigors, whereas the original pharyngeal \u2044 tonsillar condition may have improved (28) . The infection has local effects, classically causing thrombosis in the ipsilateral internal jugular vein (IJV), and more distant spread with suppuration most commonly affecting the lungs, but also causing septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, meningitis and liver, renal and skin abscesses ('necrobacillosis') (28).",

Surgical access to these lesions is most often achieved using a suspension laryngoscope and anesthesia achieved with either spontaneous ventilation with insufflation of gases into the hypopharynx or by jet ventilation. The latter can be used either supra-or infra-glottically by rigid cannulae fixed to the laryngoscope (43) . In either case, an antisialogogue is administered and topical lidocaine sprayed onto the larynx (max. 6 mgAEkg )1 ) (44, 45) . Disadvantages of jet ventilation, particularly supra-glottically, are the potential dispersion of papillomatous matter distally and the need for muscle relaxation and, if used sub-glottically, one must ensure adequate escape of gases to prevent barotrauma. However, contamination of the field and the OR with vapors are then avoided (46) . Advantages of spontaneous ventilation are the preservation of the patient's respiratory drive, a potential safety factor, and the relative containment of debrided material. Additionally, total intravenous anesthesia can reduce or supplant the need for vapors (44) (45) (46) . Tracheostomy is generally avoided as this is associated with increased distal spread (41) .",
