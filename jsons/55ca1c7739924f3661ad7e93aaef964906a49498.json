Naturally occurring infections with BDV have been confirmed in horses, sheep, cats and ostriches Lundgren et al., 1993; Malkinson et al., 19931 , and the disease can be experimentally transmitted to a wide range of animal species from birds and rodents to non-human primates. There is a variable period of incubation, as well as diverse pathological manifestations depending on the species, immune status and age of the host, as we11 as the particular virus strain used for the infection Richt et al., 1992) . Furthermore, serological data support an association of BDV with specific psychiatric disorders, providing further impetus for the study of this neurotropic infectious agent (Amsterdam et al., 1985; Bode et al., 1992 Bode et al., , 1988 Bode et al., , 1994 Fu et al., 1993; Rott et al., 1991; VandeWoude et al., 1990) .",

Tannic acid enhanced staining was employed on all samples. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Philips 410 electron microscope. The MBV cells used for these studies corresponded to passages 20 to 25 after the establishment of the persistent infections. As shown in Fig. 1 , a striking feature of BDV-infected MDCK cells was the presence of enveloped particles varying from about 50-100 nm in diameter. The particles were found in groups free in the cytoplasm, close to the plasma membrane. Most of the particles were roughly spherical, although some were ovalshaped. At higher magnification (Fig. 21 , the particles can be seen to have a limiting outer membrane with an electron dense inner leaflet. Some particles show a relatively homogeneous internal structure which sometimes has a strand-like appearance, whereas in other particles the internal ~m~nents are apparently condensed in close apposition to the outer membrane leaving an electron-lucent central region. The particles were found in proximity to the basolateral plasma membrane, but showed no association with cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi complex, or other intracytoplasmic membranes. The assembly process or site at which the particles are assembled was not observed. Some particles (e.g., one particle in Fig. 1A ) appeared to have an incompletely formed envelope consisting of a crescent-like structure.",

Because virus release occurs at very low levels in the persistently-infected MDCK cells, it has not been possible to compare the morphology of the sectioned particles with negatively stained preparations of released particles.

            "text": "Many enveloped viruses express virus-specific antigens at the plasma membrane and assemble virions by budding at the cell surface. Enveloped viruses of other families, such as bunyaviruses or coronaviruses, are assembled by budding into cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi complex (Pettersson, 1991) . In all of the above instances, the outer surfaces of the viral envelopes are covered with a layer of virus-coded glycoproteins which are synthesized as transmembrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. The glycosylated external domain is found in the lumen of the ER and/or other membranes of the exocytic pathway, and/or on the outer surface of the plasma membranes. In contrast to such assembly processes, the envelopes of the particles observed in BDV-infected cells are in direct contact with the cytoplasmic matrix, a topology which would not be expected to be compatible with the presence of a layer of external surface glycoproteins. Thus, it is surprising to find particles with the morphology of enveloped virions within the cytosol, and their assembly process remains uncertain. It has, however, been reported that rabies virus assembly can sometimes occur free in the cytoplasm (Hummeler and Tomassini, 1973) . It is possible that the particles we observed represent an unusual type of endocytic vesicle; however, vesicles of similar appearance have not been observed in uninfected MDCK cells. We did not observe release of particles into the medium, which is consistent with the finding that little or no infectious virus is released into culture medium from the persistently infected MDCK cells. If the enveloped particles observed in the present study represent BDV virions, their presence within the cytoplasm suggests an unusual assembly process which may not involve expression of viral antigens in the plasma membrane. It will be of interest to obtain further information on the structural components of BDV particles and to compare their assembly process with the other members of the order Mononegavirales. Such studies will presumably require a cell culture system which produces higher yields of infectious virus particles.",
