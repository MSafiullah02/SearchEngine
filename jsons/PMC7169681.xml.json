IA has been reported in 1.6%\u201014% of heart transplant recipients (HTRs), with most the cases occurring within the first 3 months post transplant.1 Nosocomially acquired IA has been noted in setting of outbreaks, and has been linked to construction work within the hospital settings or surroundings. Delay in establishing an early diagnosis remains a major impediment to the successful treatment of IA. Data in hematological malignancies suggest that computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest may detect the diseases earlier than serum galactomannan (GM).2 However, the appropriate screening strategy for IA in the setting of an outbreak in HTRs remains undefined.",

The antimicrobial prophylaxis implemented during the outbreak following heart transplantation for all new HTRs from October 2013 onward was micafungin 50 mg intravenously daily while the patients were hospitalized, followed by inhaled amphotericin (AmB) 20 mg twice a day for 3 months. For recipients transplanted between February and October of 2013, serum GM and screening chest CT scans were performed; and if the CT scan of the chest was normal, they were started on inhaled AmB for 3 months. Abnormal CT findings prompted a diagnostic workup including bronchoscopy with cultures and GM, and/or biopsy.

The median time from transplantation to initial chest CT was 164 days (IQR 115\u2010216), 292 days (IQR 248\u2010335) for second CT, and 366 days (IQR 348\u2010388) for third CT. Four (27%) HTRs had abnormal initial CT scans, two of which were diagnosed with IA (Figure 2A and B). Both IA cases had the diagnosis of IA established after imaging screening although they were asymptomatic. The other two HTRs with abnormal CT chest were diagnosed with post\u2010transplant lymphoproliferative disease and coronavirus lower respiratory tract infection respectively. The two asymptomatic cases of IA that were identified by screening had complete response to therapy at 12 weeks of treatment with voriconazole compared to partial or failure of therapy in the five index cases (Table 1). Serum GM was performed on 30 HTRs; it was positive only in one of five symptomatic cases. Bronchoalveolar lavage GM was performed in five of the symptomatic HTRs with IA and was positive in four patients. Of a total of 28 who received inhaled AmB, 53% had to discontinue treatment before the end of 3 months because of side effects. None of the HTRs who had normal CTs and subsequently received prophylaxis developed IA. No additional cases of IA were identified since the screening and prophylactic measures were instituted (Figure 1).",

Munoz et al1 described a similarly adverse outcome, with two deaths of three patients affected during an outbreak of IA in a major heart surgery unit. In addition, similar to other SOT studies,1 the sensitivity of serum GM in detecting cases of IA was poor; only one HTR with IA had a positive serum GM. Hence, we could not rely on the latter as a screening tool, and performed low radiation dose CT scans of the chest on asymptomatic HTRs. This helped to identify two asymptomatic HTRs with IA, who achieved complete response to therapy at 12 weeks, as compared to partial response or failure to therapy in the rest of cohort, including three deaths. Although this screening strategy might be costly and expose patient to increased radiation, it helped identify asymptomatic HTRs early in the course of disease. The concept of early diagnosis and improved outcomes has been shown in patients with hematological malignancy and invasive fungal infection.2, 6 This strategy also helped in following patients who did not tolerate prophylaxis because of side effects, and ensureing that these HTRs did not develop IA.",

Despite our limited single\u2010center, retrospective, small cohort, and the absence of a control group, we have shown that, in an outbreak setting, early diagnosis of IA by CT scanning of the chest may be an effective screening strategy in HTRs and improve outcomes. The negative predictive value of CT scans in diagnosis IA was 100%; 95% confidence interval (71.5%\u2010100%). Based on our experience during an outbreak of aspergillosis, we propose a combination of screening thoracic CT scans on patients transplanted during the same period as the index cases, in addition to universal prophylaxis on all new HTRs. However, since this study represents the experience of a single center in the context of an outbreak, larger studies will be needed before our strategy can be recommended for generalization.",
