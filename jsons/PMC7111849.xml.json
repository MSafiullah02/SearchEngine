            "text": "Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans (Li et al., 2003, Li et al., 2004, Li et al., 2005a, Li et al., 2005b). ACE2 is an 805 amino acid carboxy-metalloprotease and plays a significant role in cardiovascular physiology (Eriksson et al., 2002). Several lines of findings demonstrated N terminal of human ACE2 (hACE2), independent of proteolytic site, contains the binding domain of SARS-CoV S1, the receptor binding protein (Hofmann et al., 2004, Li et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2006). Furthermore, the replication limitation of SARS-CoV in non-primate animals is determined by the natural ACE2 homologs from non-primate animals such as mice, rats and palm-civets (Li et al., 2004, Li et al., 2005a, Li et al., 2005b). SARS-CoV could infect domestic cats (Martina et al., 2003, Ng, 2003). This study was aimed to clone fACE2 gene from cat tissue and revealed the potential ability of fACE2 to mediate SARS-CoV infection of cats.",

Four fragments of fACE2 gene were amplified with the primers based on hACE2 gene (GenBank accession: AF241254) and the resultant fACE2 sequence obtained by the previous steps. The primers for fragment 1 (440\u20131495 nt in hACE2 gene) are F1: 5\u2032-AGCAAACGGTTGAACAC-3\u2032, and R1: 5\u2032-AAGACCATCCACCTCCAC-3\u2032 specific to hACE2. Fragment 2 (2\u2013831nt in hACE2 gene) was amplified with primers F2: 5\u2032-GCCCAACCCAAGTTCAAAGGCT-3\u2032 specific to hACE2 gene and R2: 5\u2032-AAGGGTAGGTATCCATCAAC-3\u2032 specific to fragment 1. Fragment 3 from 1287 nt to 2504 nt was obtained with primers F3: 5\u2032-AGATCATGTCACTTTCTGCG-3\u2032 specific to fragment 1 and R3: 5\u2032-ATCATCAGTGTTTTGGAATC-3\u2032 specific to hACE2 gene.

As a result, the coding region of fACE2 gene is spliced which is 2418 bp in length, same as that of human (GenBank accession: AF241254), mouse (GenBank accession: AB053181) and rat ACE2 (GenBank accession: AY881244). It encodes 805 amino acids including 17aa of signal peptide sequence and C-terminal transmembrane domain. The similarities to that of human, mouse and rat ACE2 are, respectively, 85%, 84% and 84% at the nucleotide level and 85%, 81% and 81% at the deduced amino acid level.

SDS\u2013PAGE detected the expression at the size of about 42 kDa as expected. Both fACE219\u2013367 and Vero E6 ACE219\u2013367 previously expressed by this laboratory (Yang et al., 2006) were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%).Western blot assay was performed with goat polyclonal antibody to hACE2 (R&D) and HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotech) (Sambrook et al., 1989). This result showed that fACE219\u2013367 could cross-react with the antibody to hACE2. Alternatively, the purified SARS-CoV S1 protein, rabbit antiserum to S1 prepared by this laboratory (Fei et al., 2006) were sequentially overlaid on the blotted membrane. This ligand blotting assay indicated that S1 could detect His-tagged fACE219\u2013367 of 42 kDa, as well as GST-ACE219\u2013367 of 65 kDa from Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2\n).",
