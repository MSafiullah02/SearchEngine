            "text": "The epidemiology of animal virus diseases has changed significantly by the introduction of artificial insemination (AI). The application of artificial insemination prevents the transmission and spread of virus by direct contact between males and females, and it has been proven that artificial insemination improves the control of many diseases. On the other hand, virus spread by contaminated semen by artificial insemination can be enormous, since contaminated semen could infect numerous farms, areas, or even countries within a few hours or days. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been detected in semen (Guerin et al., 1995), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and African swine fever virus (AFSV) have been isolated from porcine semen (Thacker et al., 1984). For SVDV and AFSV, transmission to sows by artificial insemination of contaminated semen has been reported (McVicar et al., 1977, Thacker et al., 1984). Under experimental conditions it was shown that transmission of CSFV by artificial insemination was possible and that semen contaminated with CSFV could cause an infection in sows after artificial insemination (de Smit et al., 1999). Transmission of PRRSV to sows artificially inseminated with undiluted semen from experimentally infected boars has also been demonstrated (Yaeger et al., 1993). It has been suggested that the introduction of PRRSV in herds by semen contaminated with PRRSV might even be of high risk (LePotier et al., 1997).",

It has been shown that even matrices such as boar semen can be used in PCR-based tests (Shin et al., 1997). However, conventional PCR tests can be hampered by the high risk of contamination of previously amplified material. Recently, the quantitative ReTi-PCR technology has been developed with several advantages to the conventional PCR. The ReTi-PCR technique combines amplification and detection of amplified products in one closed tube. Therefore amplified material will not be released in the environment by reopening and other handlings of test tubes. Consequently, the chance of contamination of other test samples by previously amplified material is strongly reduced.",

Additionally, the fundamental specificity of primers and probes were confirmed by nucleotide sequence alignments with known sequences of closely related viruses using blast search at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (OMIGA). If necessary, primers and/or probes were degenerated at defined nucleotide positions in order to maximize the detection of all known strains and isolates. For each ReTi-PCR, two probes were designed to hybridize side by side on the PCR product. The 3\u2032 end of the upstream probe was labeled with fluorescein acting as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor for the acceptor dye (LC Red 640) coupled to the 5\u2032 end of the downstream probe. The FRET signal is transmitted only if donor and acceptor hybridize to their respective specific regions and in the vicinity of each other.",

Briefly, per microplate well (6-well cell culture plate) 106 cells in RPMI were seeded and incubated with 480 \u03bcl of 10 and 100 times diluted semen. Incubation and a blind passage were performed as described for FMDV (see above). Cells were screened for the presence of PRRSV antigens by IPMA using monoclonal antibodies. In addition, for a very limited number of samples a bioassay was performed. Therefore, a volume of 10 ml of semen was intra-peritoneally injected in 10-week-old pigs. Serum samples were collected for 2 weeks, and screened for the presence of PRRSV.",

Furthermore, ReTi-PCR tests proved to have several advantages in the detection of viruses in semen above the conventionally used virus isolation methods. Due to its sensitivity and rapidity, ReTi-PCR tests can be used for the sensitive screening of semen for the presence of viruses during outbreaks, for the rapid screening of semen for the presence of e.g. PRRSV prior to artificial insemination, and these tests offer opportunities for the early diagnosis of list A-diseases. The ReTi-PCR technique makes it possible to develop highly specific PCR tests mainly based on the strategic choice of primers in combination with specific probes. Herein, the blast search is a powerful tool in the search for conserved regions with respect to related and non-related viruses. Due to strict regimes of sample preparation, and the use of a closed system (amplification and analyses in one closed capillary) strongly reduces the spread of previously amplified product and consequently the risk of contamination as observed by conventional PCR techniques.",

            "text": "The use of artificial insemination has increased enormously in the swine industry. One disadvantage of this increase might be that one infected boar can rapidly infect multiple sows in more than one area or country. As viral infections can run a subclinical course, not all virus infections in boars will result in clinical symptoms, such as fever or reduced libido. This indicates that boars can shed virus in semen without showing clinical signs. This theory was confirmed by some of the boars infected experimentally. PRV, CSFV, FMDV, PRRSV, and to a lesser extent SVDV, were excreted in semen of experimentally infected boars, and furthermore, excretion could occur intermittently. For PRRSV it was shown that excretion in semen was prolonged and PRRSV could be detected for a longer time in semen than in blood. This means that PRRSV test results of blood samples not always reflect the situation in semen, and that, despite intensive monitoring of boars with regular tests on blood samples, the safety of semen cannot be guaranteed for 100%. Although we did not use infected semen on recipient sows, others have shown that intra-vaginal infection by artificial insemination with contaminated semen is possible (Thacker et al., 1984, Yaeger et al., 1993, de Smit et al., 1999).",

To minimize the risk of introducing viral infections by artificial insemination as much as possible, semen may be screened for the presence of infectious viruses or viral genomic sequences by very sensitive tests. Due to the fact that undiluted semen is often toxic for cultures of many cell types, virus isolation can often not be used for the detection of viruses in semen or its sensitivity is too low. In addition, virus isolation is laborious and expensive. But most important, virus isolation is time consuming and therefore not applicable for boar semen, since this can only be stored temporarily, or for the rapid diagnosis of list-A diseases. Most conventional methods, used for the diagnosis of list-A diseases, take several days depending on the virus of interest. In contrast to virus isolation, the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests are rapid assays as results can be obtained within 4 h. This also offers opportunities to screen fresh semen prior to insemination for the presence of viruses such as PRRSV, as semen has been suspected to be an important source in the transmission of PRRSV (LePotier et al., 1997).",

For PRRSV, the sensitive bioassay confirmed two positive results of the ReTi-PCR, whereas virus isolations of these semen samples were negative. The presence of neutralizing antibodies may partly interfere with the low virus recovery by virus isolation. The presence of neutralizing antibodies might also explain the low recovery of CSFV in semen collected after day 12 pi by virus isolation, as antibodies were detected in all boars experimentally infected with CSFV. Furthermore, our study also shows that the presence of viruses in semen was detected earlier by ReTi-PCR than by virus isolation, but also earlier than most antibody detection assays. For example, the ReTi-PCR was able to detect FMDV at 1 day pi. Early diagnosis and rapid measures to reduce the transmission and spread of list-A diseases, such as CFS, FMD and SVD, are of great importance. However, the ReTi-PCR tests may also have their limitations as some semen samples were scored as negative whereas virus isolation became positive, although only after one blind passage. A more extensive validation study needs to be performed to determine the real percentage of false negative samples by ReTi-PCR, and whether these ReTi-PCR tests have their limitations.",

It is appreciated that the PRV, CSFV, and the SVDV ReTi-PCR tests still have to prove their value in outbreak situations, and that the PRRSV ReTi-PCR has to prove its value for export and in the delivery of PRRSV-negative semen to PRRSV-free herds. To date, only the FMDV ReTi-PCR has proven its value in an outbreak situation. Their study showed that for the validation of other samples, such as plasma and tissues samples, only the DNA/RNA isolation procedure for that particular sample had to be optimized, whereas the conditions for amplification and detection remained unchanged (Moonen et al., 2003).",
