            "text": "Influenza is an acute but normally self-limiting respiratory disease caused by influenza virus that results in considerable morbidity and lost working days. Patient groups such as the elderly, the immunocompromised and those with underlying chronic conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are vulnerable to complications that can result in mortality. Influenza virus is an enveloped, single stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome. The three genera known as A, B and C are grouped by differences in their core proteins; influenza A and B are the most common and are strongly associated with epidemics. Historically, the only therapies for influenza A infection were amantidine and rimantidine that inhibit viral entry into cells by targeting the M2 protein of influenza A virus. More recently treatment options for influenza A and B have expanded to include the neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir (RELENZA\u2122) and oseltamivir (TAMIFLU\u2122). Neuraminidase promotes influenza virus release from infected cells and facilitates virus spread within the respiratory tract. These inhibitors block replication of both influenza A and B viruses, cause fewer side effects and have less potential to select resistant variants than the M2 inhibitors. Early treatment with either drug reduces the severity and duration of influenza symptoms and associated complications (Hayden et al., 1996, Hayden et al., 1997, Treanor et al., 2000, Makela et al., 2000, Monto et al., 2000, Kashiwagi et al., 2000).",

            "text": "The antiviral efficacy of zanamivir was monitored by analysis of the rate of decline in upper airway viral load determined during a time course of treatment. The viral titres present in patient samples were historically determined by a culture-enhanced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CE-ELISA), or plaque assay as described by Barnett et al. (2000). Since these methods rely on the ability of clinical isolates to replicate in cell culture, it may not be possible to quantify viruses that replicate inefficiently, or fail to produce cytopathic effects in cell culture. A fluorogenic real-time PCR-based technique that detects and quantifies influenza A and B virus RNA has been developed to serve as an alternative assay that is not dependent upon the replicative efficiency of the virus in cell culture, the capacity of the virus to form plaques, or the sensitivity and specificity of monoclonal antibodies. Real time qPCR is a modified form of PCR that measures an increase in PCR product over time. Reactions that exploit the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 nuclease activity of Taq polymerase to cleave a sequence specific fluorescent labelled probe are sometimes known as TaqMan\u00ae PCR (Holland et al., 1991, Lee et al., 1993, Livak et al., 1995).",

The precision of the method was determined by assessing the agreement between replicate measurements of validation control samples by transforming the raw data to their common logarithms and performing analysis of variance (ANOVA). The lower and upper limits of quantification were defined by the validation control sample concentrations possessing acceptable precision, which was the lowest amount of influenza in vRNA copies/ml present in a sample for which the coefficient of variation does not exceed 100%. The lower limit of quantitation was 3.33 log10 copies/ml (ten copies/PCR reaction).

The real time quantitative PCR assays described have been applied to determine the antiviral activity of inhaled zanamivir for the treatment of naturally acquired influenza in military recruits living in residential units. A significant increase in the rate of viral load reduction was shown once zanamivir therapy had commenced as compared with placebo (Puhakka et al., 2003). Assays used historically were semi-quantitative and dependent upon the growth of infectious virus, and for plaque assays, upon the capacity of the virus to form plaques. The variation in the minimum number of influenza virus copies of different virus subtypes required to generate a stock of infectious virus may be due to differences in adaptation to cell culture or variation in the levels of non-infectious virus particles in these laboratory cultured virus strains. The success of assays such as the CE-ELISA is also dependent on the availability of monoclonal antibodies of high sensitivity and specificity to detect viral nucleoprotein. There is evidence to suggest that the results of diagnostic tests dependent upon the detection of nucleoprotein by an enzyme conjugated monoclonal antibody, such as Directigen\u2122 FLU-A test (Beckton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Maryland, US), are affected by freezing and thawing of specimens prior to testing (Waner et al., 1991). The nucleic acid based real time PCR assays were not affected by up to five sample freeze\u2013thaw events, suggesting that even though influenza is an RNA virus, methods based upon the amplification of short segments of viral RNA are robust. Decreases in viral load were generally less rapid when measured by real time qPCR than when measured by CE-ELISA. This was probably due to the slower decay rate of the viral nucleic acid measured by PCR relative to infectious virus.",

The inclusion of an external standard curve and the reliable quantification of influenza cDNA in assays which are linear over seven orders of magnitude eliminates the need for sample dilution, which minimises sample handling and associated increases in variability. Limited data (not shown) suggests that for samples with higher viral loads an accurate quantitative result can be obtained by extrapolation of the standard curve but the reporting of low viral load quantities should be interpreted with caution, particularly small magnitude viral load changes at low viral loads. The chance of experiencing cross-contamination and hence false positive results is low as the need for post PCR sample handling is removed, since the detection of the PCR products occurs online during real-time PCR amplification. Real time qPCR reactions can be set up in advance of cycling, allowing processing in batches. Additionally, appropriately archived samples or cDNA primed with random hexamers or appropriate specific primers can be re-tested using these real time qPCR assays as they are not dependent on the infectivity of the virus.",

At concentrations below the limit of quantification the coefficient of variation between repeated tests becomes unacceptably large and the actual quantity difficult to interpret, as is the case for all PCR based assays. Probability rather than sample quality variation is the predominant cause of variability at low copy numbers (De Vries et al., 1999). The theoretical uncertainty of measurements made by quantitative PCR has been modelled. The theoretical variability of viral loads of below ten copies/PCR reaction (3.33 log10 copies/ml) was calculated to be greater than 30%, even assuming optimal PCR efficiency and excluding other variables (Peccoud and Jacob, 1996).

Our data suggests that at the viral loads tested it is feasible to thaw and re-test throat swab samples stored in virus transport medium up to five times.

However, the real time PCR assays were 93 fold more sensitive than the virus infectivity assay (CE-ELISA), so potentially more useful where maximal sensitivity was required for the analysis of influenza viral load as is required for clinical trials. Similarly, the real time qPCR assays appeared to be more sensitive when applied to clinical samples. For clinical trials of zanamivir there was a requirement to quantify virus in the throat, which is the main site of action of the drug, as well as the nose where titres may be higher. Therefore, use of the real time PCR assays allows quantitation of viral load at lower concentrations of virus, which may be negative by the CE-ELISA method. However, a further distinction between the two assays is that the CE-ELISA detects only infectious virus, whereas PCR assays including these real time qPCR assays detect both infectious and non-infectious virus. Therefore, detection and quantitation of viral nucleic acid by the real time PCRs may reflect the presence of some virus, which is unable to produce an infection. The production of non-infectious virus particles, known as the Von Magnus effect, is particularly common in laboratory strains of virus.

Three different haemaglutinin and two neuraminidase subtypes account for virtually all human infections (Hayden and Palese, 1997). All of the M1 sequences from these subtypes found in humans including the H5N1 strain recovered from an outbreak in Hong Kong (Claas et al., 1998), aligned with the probe and primer sequences for influenza A. Unlike the assay described here, other published assays (van Elden et al., 2001, Schweiger et al., 2000) are unlikely to quantify accurately or sensitively detect H5N1 isolates due to misalignment of at least one and up to four nucleotide changes in the probe sequence. This highlights the need for regular reviews of any primer or probe sequences used diagnostically or for quantification of viruses that are subject to genetic drift. The robustness of the assay primers was confirmed by the similar qualitative results obtained by SYBR Green assays, although the SYBR Green assay tended to report slightly higher viral load values.",
