The discipline of palliative medicine prides itself on patient autonomy and fulfilment of personal care preferences. We believe that each patient is unique with needs based on personal experiences and cultural, familial and social influences. These considerations impact how we communicate and treat each patient. Similarly, for policy makers drafting infection control measures in the COVID-19 pandemic, cultural and societal norms warrant special consideration to ensure that measures implemented are acceptable and feasible to the general public.",

Social-distancing means that such activities are no longer possible. This disruption in the daily routine of the elderly erodes the image of the \u201cideal\u201d independent elderly.

Filial piety, which is defined by the principle of non-abandonment motivates carers of the frail or sick elderly to continue traveling between households to provide care. Restrictions on traveling are particularly agonising for families who need to support an elderly patient with cancer, who may wish to achieve a home death with home hospice support. Reciprocally, the elderly sick may also perceive themselves as a threat to the harmony of the family unit by being a source of emotional, financial and physical burden. This complex web of reciprocal familial obligations and self-sacrifice across both the patient and family members is commonly witnessed in the practice of palliative medicine.",
