The hypervariable region of nsp2 was essential for NF-\u03baB activation (Fang et al., 2012a) . This finding was supported by Huang et al ) that nsp2 of HP-PRRSV had no inhibitory effect on IFN\u03b2 production. The nsp2 function for the innate immune modulation needs to be clarified. nsp4: PRRSV nsp4 is a serine proteinase (SP) and inhibits IFN\u03b2 promoter activity (Beura et al., 2010). Nsp4 did not hinder NF-kB phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation but antagonize IFN\u03b2 transcription in the nucleus (Chen et al., 2014b). The inhibition depends on the SP activity in nsp4. Studies also show that nsp4 cleaves NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) at a single site (glutamate 349) and thus suppresses NF-\u03baB activation and IFN\u03b2 production (Huang et al., 2014). However, a recent study showed that scission of NEMO by nsp4 occurred at two additional sites (glutamates 166 and 171) (Chen et al., 2019). This study further showed the NEMO fragment of residues 1-349 could activate IFN-\u03b2 transcription more robustly than full-length NEMO, whereas all other NEMO cleavage products were abrogated for the IFN-\u03b2-inducing capacity. Thus, NEMO cleavage at E349 alone may not be sufficient to completely inactivate the IFN response via this signaling adaptor. These findings suggest that the multiple-site NEMO-cleavage by nsp4 is critical for disarming the innate immune response for viral survival. Additionally, nsp4 suppresses IFN\u03b2 transcription by blocking NF-\u03baB activation (Chen et al., 2014b). PRRSV nsp4 of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

The etiologic agents were identified shortly in the Netherlands and the US, and these viruses were named Lelystad and VR-2332, respectively (Benfield et al., 1992; Wensvoort et al., 1991) . The genomic sequences of Lelystad and VR-2332 show only approximately 60% identity (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999) , and thus PRRSV isolates are grouped to PRRSV-1 (formerly known as European genotype) and PRRSV-2 (formerly known as North American genotype), respectively. Since its emergence, PRRSV has been evolving greatly, and a recent variant of PRRS-2 in China shows much higher virulence compared to previous isolates (Tian et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008) . Regardless of the genetic types of PRRSV, clinical manifestations are similar representing mainly respiratory symptoms in piglets and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f abortion, reproductive failure, fetal death, and congenital infections in pregnant animals (See a review in Chand et al., 2012) .",

The viral genome is a single-stranded positivesense RNA molecule of approximately 15 Kb in length with the 5'-cap and 3'polyadenylation (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999; Wootton et al., 2000) . The PRRSV genome contains 11 open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs 3 through 7, plus the newly identified ORF5a and ORF2 (TF) (Fang et al., 2012b; Firth et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2011) . ORF1a and ORF1b occupy 75% of the genome and overlap slightly. They code for two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b, of which pp1b is translated by the -1 ribosomal frameshift in the overlapping region (den Boon et al., 1991) . Pp1a contains four viral proteinase activities: two papain-like cysteine proteinases (PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2), poliovirus 3C-like cysteine proteinase (CP or PLP2), and serine proteinase (SP), residing in nonstructural proteins (nsps) 1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, and nsp4, respectively. The proteolytic processing of pp1a and pp1ab is reviewed elsewhere (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder et al., 2013) . PLP1\u03b1, PLP1\u03b2, and PLP2 generate nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, and nsp2 from pp1a, respectively, and SP in nsp4 generates nsp3 through nsp14. Thus, a total of 14 nsps are generated from pp1a and pp1b by autoproteolytic processing. Two additional nsps have newly been identified within nsp2, and nsp2TF and nsp2N are generated by -1/-2 frameshifting (Fang et al., 2012b) . The remaining 25% of the viral J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f genome codes for nine structural proteins; seven membrane proteins (GP2a, GP2b[E], GP3, GP4, GP5a, GP5, and M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein.",

The binding of IFNs to their receptors phosphorylates Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) and activates signal transducers and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and STAT2, which recruits interferon response factor 9 (IRF9) to form an IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. ISGF3 enters the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated regulatory response elements (ISRE) of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) for expression, and ISGs are the major executors to establish an antiviral status of cells and to regulate other cellular functions (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014; Schneider et al., 2014) .",

Ubiquitination and ISGylation are important posttranslational modifications involved in the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and tolllike receptors (TLRs) signaling pathways, and the OTU domain interferes these pathways to antagonize type I IFN production (Makarova et al., 2000) . The DUB activity of nsp2 OTU interferes with the polyubiquitination process of I\u03baB\u03b1 and prevents I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, leading to inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. Nsp2 inhibits IFN\u03b2 production by suppressing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f different pathogenic strains has a different ability to inhibit IFN\u03b2 expression. HP-PRRSV nsp4 has greater inhibitory effect on IFN\u03b2 than nsp4 of less pathogenic strains. As discussed above, nsp1\u03b1 binds to and degrades SLA-I (Du et al., 2016a) , A recent study supports this finding that HP-PRRSV nsp4 also downregulates the cellular level of \u03b22microglobulin (\u03b22M) (Qi et al., 2017) , which forms a heterotrimeric complex with the SLA-I heavy chain and plays a critica1 role in SLA-I antigen presentation. PRRSV nsp4 binds to the B2M promoter and suppresses \u03b22M transcription. These findings imply that HP-PRRSV may modulate the SLA-I antigen presentation pathway, suggesting that the IFN inhibition by nsp4 is correlated with PRRSV pathogenesis. nsp11: PRRSV nsp11 is a nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (Nedialkova et al., 2009 ).",

PRRSV upregulates the proapoptotic protein Bax expression and causes cytochrome C release and caspase-9 activation (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2007) . In addition, the decrease of antiapoptotic protein and the increase of proapoptotic protein make an additional contribution to PRRSVinduced mitochondrial apoptosis (Yin et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2016) . PRRSV also increases TNFR1/FasL, indicating the contribution of the death receptor pathway to apoptosis. Thus, a crosstalk seems to occur between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways for PRRSV-mediated apoptosis. GP5 was initially suggested as the viral protein for inducing PRRSV apoptosis (Su\u00e1rez et al., 1996) , but it was not possible to confirm that finding (Lee J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f et al., 2004) , and instead, nsp4 and nsp10 were recently determined as the PRRSV apoptotic proteins (Yuan et al., 2016) .",

Three major MAPK pathways are described; ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2), JNK, and p38. The activation of MAPKs is a common event in response to viral infection (Fung and Liu, 2017; Nacken et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2009) . During PRRSV infection, JNK is activated (Huo et al., 2013; Jing et al., 2014; Lee and Lee, 2012; Liu et al., 2017b; Yin et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2016) , which is attributed to ROS generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Huo et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2012) . The JNK activation by PRRSV also contributes to virus-induced cytokine production (Lee and Lee, 2012; Liu et al., 2017b) . Changes in redox balance during viral infection are linked to viral pathogenesis (Lee, 2018) , and an oxidative stress is induced by PRRSV in both cells and pigs (Yan et al., , 2015 . The increased ROS generation by PRRSV likely attributes to the elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is associated with the changes of heat shock protein 90 and caveolin-1 expression. Inhibition of ROS generation by antioxidant protects cells from PRRSVinduced apoptosis through suppressing JNK activation (Yin et al., 2012) . In addition, decreased glutathione peroxidase is observed in PRRSV-infected pigs (\u0160tukelj et al., 2013) , suggesting that inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activity may also contribute to oxidative stress by PRRSV infection.",

For PRRSV, the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated at an early stage of infection (Huo et al., 2013; Ni et al., 2015; Pujhari et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014a; Zhang and Wang, 2010; Zhu et al., 2013) . The Akt activation by PRRSV leads to negative regulation of the JNK pathway (Huo et al., 2013) and inhibits host cell apoptosis early in infection through inhibitory phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic protein Bad (Zhu et al., 2013) . Both FAK and EGFR are induced by PRRSV, which in turn contributes to PI3K/Akt activation. Thus, the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway inhibits PRRSV-induced apoptosis and facilitates viral replication. Ensembl release 77; https://m.ensembl.org/index.html), which is probably due to incomplete swine genome sequence and its annotation . In one study using sows, endometrial samples were collected from pregnant animals and the expression profiles of miRNAs were examined. A total of 288 miRNAs were identified in the pig endometrium (Hong et al., 2019) . Studies have been conducted to determine the host cell-PRRSV interaction networks, and numerous species of miRNAs appear to be altered (Calcatera et al., 2018; Dhorne-Pollet et al., 2019; Hicks et al., 2013; Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019a) , suggesting that host miRNAs indeed modulate PRRSV replication, either positively or negatively. miR-181, miR-23, miR-30c, and miR-24-3p are reported to play important roles in PRRSV replication and in modulating host antiviral responses, while other such as miR-204, miR-221, and miR-219 need more study to understand for their functions . Some of the miRNAs are discussed below for their role in during PRRSV infection. At the time of writing this review, it is somewhat difficult to translate the differential expression of miRNA for meaningful implications for PRRS pathogenesis, and thus it is prepared as a systematic review with limited critical analyses.",

Previous studies show that the expressions of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 are significantly elevated in virulent PRRSV-infected swine (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2004) . Similarly, HP-PRRSV generates high levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in peripheral blood , indicating that HP-PRRSV may aggravate inflammation and damage tissues and organs. In addition, in pregnant gilts that are challenged on 85 days of gestation and euthanized 21 days postinfection, cytokine gene expressions are significantly upregulated in the thymus and spleen of the fetuses (Pasternak et al., 2020) .",

The inflammation in the lungs by PRRSV stimulates the recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to affected sites, and the recruitment of fresh target cells provides favorable conditions to PRRSV for replication. PRRSV activates NF-kB during infection (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2005) , and N and nsp2 have been reported as the activators, whereas nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, nsp4, and nsp11 are known as the suppressors. The dual roles of PRRSV for NF-\u03baB regulation make the viral pathogenesis complicated. It seems that the suppression of NF-\u03baB leads to the suppression of type I IFN response (see the section \"2.1 Suppression of Type 1 interferon response\"), and the activation of NF-\u03baB results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines. While the bases for NF-\u03baB suppression and IFN inhibition by PRRSV are well characterized, mechanisms for NF-\u03baB activation is poorly studied. Ke et al (2019b) recently described a molecular basis for NF-\u03baB activation by PRRSV. In that study, PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1) was identified as the cellular protein binding to N of PRRSV. Since PIAS1 can function as a repressor for NF-\u03baB, binding of N to PIAS1 releases the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB. As a result, NF-\u03baB is activated and triggers the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.",

IL-17 production by nsp11 was also dependent on the PI3K-p38MAPK-C/EBP\u03b2/CREB pathways. A PI3K inhibitor impaired IL-17 production and alleviated lung inflammation caused by HP-PRRSV infection in pigs, indicating higher IL-17 level induced by HP-PRRSV might be associated with severe lung inflammation and pneumonia .",

The ER is an organelle for lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, folding, and maturation. Cellular disturbances such as redox imbalance can cause accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins, leading to activation of an UPR. The outcome of UPR is mitigation of ER stress through blocking protein translation, increasing protein folding capacity, and promoting ubiquitination-mediated misfolded protein degradation, and reestablishing the homeostasis (Wu and Kaufman, 2006) . Prolonged activation of UPR may result in cell deaths. For PRRSV, two branches of UPR pathways, IRE1-XBP1 and PERK-eIF2\u03b1, are activated. The UPR induction by PRRSV contributes to apoptosis (Huo et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2016) and deregulates cytokine production in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f PAMs (Chen et al., 2017b) . Further studies reveal that GP2a targets GRP78 for degradation . Moreover, the UPR does not inhibit but instead stimulates efficient replication of PRRSV . In response to PRRSV infection, induction of UPR has been found not only contributing to PRRSV-induced apoptosis in host cells (Huo et al., 2013) , but also involving in the regulation of viral replication and dysregulation of cytokine production in PAMs (Chen et al., 2017b) .",

Thus, miRNAs are important gene regulators for differentiation, developments, cellular proliferation and death, immune responses, and microbial infections. During viral infection, miRNAs can affect viral replication by regulating host immune responses to generate a less favorable environment for invading viruses. In turn, many viruses have evolved to produce miRNAs that can act as a negative regulator for immune response and to promote viral replication. The number of known pig miRNA genes is relatively low when compared to human and mouse genomes (877 for pig vs. 4272 for human and 2009 for mouse, ver.",

The overexpression of miR-130 does not induce IFN-\u03b1 or TNF-\u03b1 expression in PRRSV-infected PAMs. miR-130 directly targets the 5' UTR of the PRRSV genome.Intranasal inoculation of piglets with miR-130b has exhibited antiviral activity in vivo and partially protected piglets from a lethal challenge with HP-PRRSV, demonstrating the importance of the miR-130 family in inhibiting PRRSV replication.miRNA-181 and miRNA-206: miR-181 is a positive regulator of immune response, and miR-181 can directly impair PRRSV infection. miR-181 strongly inhibits PRRSV replication in vitro by specific binding to a highly (over 96%) conserved region in the downstream of ORF4 of the viral genome. The inhibition of PRRSV J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f replication is specific and dose dependent. The interactions between miR-181 and PRRSV mRNAs are specific. miR-181 and other PRRSV-targeting miRNAs, such as miR-206, are expressed much more abundantly in minimally permissive cells and tissues than in highly permissive cells and tissues. HP-PRRSV-infected pigs treated with miR-181 mimics show a substantially decrease in viral loads in blood and relief from fever compared to controls, indicating the important role of host miRNAs in modulating PRRSV infection and viral pathogenesis, which also supports the idea that host miRNAs may be useful for RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated antiviral therapeutic strategies.miRNA-506: miR-506 can target porcine CD151 3'-UTR mRNA, and overexpression of miR-506 significantly decreases CD151 expression at both mRNA and protein levels(Wu et al., 2014). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-506 reduces PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells.",

The analysis of recombinants between the 1991-2013 data and the 2014-2018 data show a trend moving from complex to simple.
