In fact, first responders and local healthcare practitioners, and even non-clinical locals rush to the scene and to local healthcare facilities to offer their services or make donations. The presence of so many volunteers and donations can be of great help during a disaster if properly managed. Even before 9/11, hospitals were required to have a disaster plan and ensure that their employees were familiar with it. Very few hospitals, however, actually worked on coordinating their disaster response plans with other hospital facilities, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), or local governmental facilities to offer a united response in case of a disaster. 1 Healthcare institutions therefore had difficulties not only working with other institutions preparing for a disaster but also were often unprepared for managing unexpected resources from the community.",

Commonly cited references for medical practitioners such as Up-To-Date.com now describe how to manage disaster victims and describe the different signs and symptoms of major biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction. 3 Disaster drill frequency has increased across the country. However, even now, post-9/11, disaster preparedness is in its infancy. A 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study on terrorism preparedness for officebased medical practitioners from 2003 to 2004 showed that less than 50% of physicians received some kind of training on at least one terrorism-related disease. 4 An even smaller percentage of allied health professionals received this training. The debacle of coordinating an efficient response to the flood victims in Louisiana also indicates that more training and education in the field of disaster medicine is needed. Training for the specialized field of terror medicine is also necessary as long as governments are an active target of terrorists.",

First, how should an institution respond to a terrorist attack? The details of a particular hospital's response plan are not obvious and require thoughtful development by administrators, clinicians, and other hospital staff who are well versed in NIMS protocols. As well, the plan needs to be rolled out to staff in a timely and efficacious manner. Second, financial planning for an MCI is essential: technologically advanced, sturdy, or space-saving medical equipment designed for MCI and often applicable for patient care during normal operations is available. Financial managers should be trained in how to incorporate MCI equipment purchases into their budgetary outlays in order to save expenses later during a real MCI. Third, terror medicine addresses incidents that -by definition -occur infrequently and unpredictably, but have high casualty rates when they do happen. Hospital staff may be trained once in the proper management protocols for MCI, but since they do not practice using these guidelines frequently, they will not be able to recall them quickly during an MCI. In a MCI, losing minutes of time can equate to losing patients. Basic education and training for terror medicine is similar to other situations like fencing: the fencer practices parries and reposts for hours until they are a part of his unconscious muscle memory and he can focus on his overall strategy. In a similar fashion, a doctor should not have to be struggling with putting on the right kind of boots and helmet while a patient lies dying at his feet. Much time can be wasted searching for the location of Personal Protective Equiment (PPE), the right persons to contact for interfacility risk communication, or the right way to request consults during an MCI. Proper education and training before MCI is essential.",

Early uses of terror weapons do not usually show a systematic application; usually the technology was developed carefully but not applied in the most strategic manner. Conventional weapons were the first to be used in mass casualty events. A very early example of a conventional attack resulting in mass casualties was Archimedes's burning mirrors used against Roman soldiers. \u2020 The pioneer of chemical weaponry was Thomas Cochrane. In the Napoleonic Wars, he proposed that the British navy use sulfur dioxide, which had a poisonous smoke. In the right wind conditions, it \"would drift onto the object of attack with the dual purpose of providing a dense smokescreen and asphyxiating or driving off the defenders.\" 5 While this use of toxins is a creative approach to chemical weaponry, it is clear that the tactic could easily turn on those who used it. Later, in World War I, chemical weapons were used more frequently. Chlorine gas was used experimentally by the Germans at Ypres in 1915 but the commanders were unprepared for its deadly success in collapsing the Allied line. The great advantage of surprise was thereby lost for an unsystematic attack with limited goals, as Heller points out. 6 If the Germans had been educated in the likely outcome of the attack, that is, the routing of thousands of Allied soldiers from their front, they would have more likely employed the new weapon more strategically. As it happened, the Allies had time to develop and roll out gas masks (primitive personal protective equipment) to their soldiers ( Fig. 5.1 ).",

During that period, the effort was made to develop CBRNE weapons as true mass casualty weapons. Discoveries in atomic physics, for instance, led to the development of fusion and fission bombs by the Allies. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 are the first clear examples of deliberate, systematic MCI weapons deployment in human history: a mass casualty weapon was deployed and the ensuing casualty levels and threat of future incidents were key factors in the surrender of Japan shortly thereafter. \u2021 The Japanese government and healthcare \u2020 When Marcellus [the Roman commander attacking Syracuse, Archimedes' city] withdrew them [his ships] a bow-shot, the old man [Archimedes] constructed a kind of hexagonal mirror, and at an interval proportionate to the size of the mirror he set similar small mirrors with four edges, moved by links and by a form of hinge, and made it the centre of the sun's beams -its noon-tide beam, whether in summer or in mid-winter. Afterwards, when the beams were reflected in the mirror, a fearful kindling of fire was raised in the ships, and at the distance of a bow-shot he turned them into ashes. In this way did the old man prevail over Marcellus with his weapons.

As shown historically, with the rise of MCI attacks, having greater disaster education can help mitigate the severity and duration of victim injuries should an MCI occur. Because much of the field is in constant flux, however, pedagogical material must often be modified and revised, and should require a low level of investment to create. The earliest educators for MCI were in the military, since historically military personnel have borne the brunt of mass casualties. Military healthcare educational research facilities shared a background with military medicine during the cold war, and were the first to approach the challenge of educating on terror medicine. The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID, http://www.usamriid.army. mil/index.htm), the center of excellence for the Department of Defense medical biological defense research, was founded in 1969. The education section of the Institute focuses on instructing military personnel on defending against biological weapons but recently has branched out to include civilian clinicians in biological terror medicine education. \u00a7 Several major civilian research facilities exist in America that provide education for MCI. In the civil healthcare environment only a few academic and hospital based institutes took the initiative and developed content for healthcare providers. Most of the work on terror was developed by grants provided by the CDC and tailored for public health with the assumption that terrorism is a public health domain. A full list of courses and publications is available. The Center for Public Health Preparedness at Harvard has developed partnerships with local, regional, and statewide organizations to promote emergency preparedness educational opportunities (homepage: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hcphp/products/ webcasts/index.html). The Integrative Center for Homeland Security at Texas A&M University (homepage: http://homelandsecurity.tamu.edu/) has begun to collaborate with Texas A&M faculty to offer courses for degree credit in the field of emergency preparedness and related areas. The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health offers a wide variety of educational material for terror medicine through its Public Health Preparedness division (homepage: http://www.jhsph.edu/ preparedness/).",

Most of the preparations were for bringing about MCI rather than for responding to it. Even so, it is useful to review historical types of training because the principle of preparedness remains the same: regularized training is remarkably effective. Students who were trained in these systems were often demonstrably more successful during combat than their counterparts, who had little or no standardized training. The Spartans, for instance, were famous for the harsh training and indoctrination of their citizen-soldiers. \u00a7 \u00a7 Because of this training, they were the most feared soldiers in ancient Greece due to their immaculate discipline and valor. \u00b6 \u00b6 Early on, the Romans had professionalized gladiator training; later, they realized that this training could carry over into other areas and applied it to their soldiers so that they were well versed in sophisticated weapons tactics. || || Later, starting in 1493 a.d., the Ottoman Empire systematically trained thousands of enslaved children of Christian subjects to be Janizaries, elite guards, and soldiers.*** Ever since the Renaissance, most military and paramilitary institutions have employed \u00a7 \u00a7 Plutarch, Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans: Lycurgus. At the age of seven, Spartan boys left home and went to live under military discipline. Those who showed the most skill and courage were appointed by the old men to be leaders, with the authority to order the other boys and the power to punish disobedience. The main subject they studied was command and obedience. Spartan boys learned enough reading and writing to be literate, but learning how to endure pain and conquer in battle was considered even more important. Of all the accidents of this war, this same fell out the most contrary to the opinion of the Grecians. For they expected that the Lacedaemonians [Spartans] should never, neither by famine nor whatsoever other necessity, have been constrained to deliver up their arms, but have died with them in their hands, fighting as long as they had been able: and would not believe that those that yielded, were like to those that were slain. || || As Valerius Maximus (ca. 20 ad) wrote in Factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri ix (Nine Books of Memorable Actions and Speeches) 2.3.2, The practice of weapons training was given to soldiers by P. Rutilius, consul with C. Mallis. For he, following the example of no previous general, with teachers summoned from the gladiatorial training school of C. Aurelus Scaurus, implanted in the legions a more sophisticated method of avoiding and dealing a blow and mixed bravery with skill and skill back again with virtue so that skill became stronger by bravery's passion and passion became more wary with the knowledge of this art. Standing in the front of their ranks, he stretched the sleeve of his gown over the head of the foremost soldier, and his blessing was delivered in the following words \"Let them be called Janizaries [yingi-cheri-or 'new soldiers']; may their counternaces be ever bright; their hand victorious; their swords keen; may their spear always hang over the heads of their enemies; and, wheresoever they go, may they return with a white face.\" .\u2026 Such was the origin of these haughty troops, the terror of the nations.\u2026 Both classes [of Janizaries] are kept under a strict discipline. The former especially are accustomed to privation of food, drink, and comfortable clothing and to hard labor. They are exercised in shooting with the bow and arquebuse by day, systematic training. The more rigorous the training, in general the more successful were the students.",

            "text": "Until the past half-century, systematic training regimens were largely used for military training and readiness and no programs for training clinicians to respond appropriately to a mass casualty event were implemented significantly. In the present day, educators and trainers have realized that training military members for war is similar in principle to training responders for MCI preparedness. Both involve readiness for low-frequency/high-casualty events: even though a battle may not loom in the near future, still, military personnel must be ready for it when it occurs. Likewise, physicians should be ready to lead their teams in the event of an MCI, and systematic training should give them the skills necessary to respond effectively. Training clinicians for terror medicine is thus a new and -given the worldwide terrorist threat levels -vitally important field. Training now involves two steps. The student must reach a competency level in a particular subject, and then undergo exercises to maintain the ability to perform that procedure. The frequency of exercises for the second step varies inversely to how often a procedure is performed in medical practice. Some procedures are crucial and have a high level of complexity, so require ongoing training. For example, C-sections are complex procedures, yet are central to obstetrics/gynecology practice, so a resident in the field must frequently be tested on the ability to perform the procedure. Other protocols are straightforward and may only be necessary if an MCI were to occur. Thus, training for these procedures can be rolled out on an ad hoc basis and is called \"Just In Time Training.\" For instance, clinicians do not need to know how to use a cyanide antidote kit in nearly every medical situation, so it would not normally be worthwhile for them to memorize the proper steps in the application of the antidote. However, if patients could have been poisoned by a cyanide agent, then they would need to be trained speedily in the proper application of the antidote.",

Training on real, living patients is the traditional way that clinical personnel have learned how to perform procedures. The advantage of training on live patients is clear: since the patients have complete fidelity to actual victims, then the physician learns exactly how to do a procedure correctly. Since terror medicine focuses upon low-frequency events, it is not ideal to rely upon live patient training to teach physicians the proper MCI response: most clinical personnel would not encounter a terror victim until an actual MCI, when large numbers of patients would threaten to overwhelm his or her ability to treat them. Other methods of training and spend the night in a long, lighted hall, with an overseer, who walks up and down, and permits no one to stir. When they are received into the corps of the Janizaries, they are placed in cloister-like barracks, in which the different odas or ortas live so entirely in common that the military dignitaries are called from their soups and kitchens. Here not only the younger continue to obey the elders in silence and submission, but all are governed with such strictness that no one is permitted to spend the night abroad, and whoever is punished is compelled to kiss the hand of him who inflicts the punishment.",
