            "text": "The Flavivirus genus is the largest of the Flaviviridae family, which are among some of the most significant emergent or re\u2010emergent human pathogens worldwide. Examples include West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses. These viruses require an arthropod vector where they are transmitted to vertebrates through an infected mosquito during its blood\u2010feeding cycle. Although flaviviruses are responsible for hundreds of millions of infections worldwide, global eradication of flaviviruses remain a challenging task mainly due to the mosquito intermediate vector. Interestingly, disturbances within the vector\u2010vertebrate equilibrium have resulted in a significant interregional spread of these viruses (Chambers, Hahn, Galler, & Rice, 1990). Most flavivirus infections are asymptomatic however, also provoke a range of clinical manifestations from mild flu\u2010like symptoms to severe complications. More specifically, WNV causes meningitis and encephalitis (Sejvar & Marfin, 2006), DENV promotes dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (Gubler, 1998), and ZIKV induces microcephaly and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (Mlakar et al., 2016). Currently, the only effective vaccines available towards flaviviruses are the tick\u2010borne encephalitis virus and JEV purified, inactivated virus vaccines and the YFV 17D live attenuated virus vaccine (Chambers et al., 1990; Leyssen, De Clercq, & Neyts, 2000; Monath, 1987; Stock, Boschetti, Herzog, Appelhans, & Niedrig, 2012).",

The 11\u2010kb genome encodes for a single polycistronic open reading frame flanked by an ~100 nucleotide 5\u2032 and 400\u2013700 nucleotide 3\u2032 untranslated region. The (+)RNA translocates to the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is then translated by the host ribosome into a polyprotein and processed into 10 proteins (Pijlman et al., 2008). Due to the limited number of viral proteins, host factors such as lipids and proteins are sequestered and exploited to assist in viral replication. Viruses require these host factors for entry, transcription and translation, immune evasion, and finally egress, which are vital stages of the viral life cycle and frequent targets during the design of \u201cnovel\u201d antiviral drugs. However, an aspect that is generally overlooked and is a significant hallmark of almost every (+)RNA virus is the formation of virus\u2010induced membrane structures (Mackenzie, 2005; Mart\u00edn\u2010Acebes, V\u00e1zquez\u2010Calvo, & Saiz, 2016; Nagy & Pogany, 2011; Neufeldt, Cortese, Acosta, & Bartenschlager, 2018). In this review, we will focus on the role of these virus\u2010induced membrane structures during flavivirus replication, examine the host factors (lipids and proteins) required for the biogenesis of these structures, and discuss the importance of targeting these structures during antiviral therapy.",

Pestivirus and hepacivirus replication occurs within a perinuclear matrix defined as the membranous web (Egger et al., 2002); bromoviruses induce numerous intraluminal ER membrane invaginations (Lee & Ahlquist, 2003); and alphaviruses replicate in spherule\u2010lined cytoplasmic vacuoles derived from the lysosome and endosomes (Froshauer, Kartenbeck, & Helenius, 1988). Flaviviruses are no exception to this process as they induce the formation of vesicle packets (VPs) and convoluted membranes/paracrystalline arrays (CM/PC) (Mackenzie, Jones, & Young, 1996). WNV\u2010induced ER rearrangements are first observed before the end of the latent period (9 to 10 h.p.i) and is apparent with an increase in cytoplasmic vacuoles (Ishak, Tovey, & Howard, 1988; Ng, 1987; Ng & Hong, 1989; Westaway, Mackenzie, Kenney, Jones, & Khromykh, 1997). As the infection progresses, membrane structures protruding the rough ER membranes proliferate with whorls of fibres in various vacuoles (Ng, 1987; later confirmed as replicating RNA by ultrastructural studies) and are followed by the formation of microtubule paracrystals (Ng & Hong, 1989). These structures have been confirmed as three continuous membranous structures: VP, CM/PC (Mackenzie et al., 1996; Westaway et al., 1997).",

The WNV VPs consist of numerous vesicles that are either connected to the rough ER or interconnected to one another by pores that open to the cytoplasm via a membranous neck (Gillespie, Hoenen, Morgan, & Mackenzie, 2010). The neck acts as a passage for the movement of cytoplasmic content into the VP and the transport of newly transcribed viral RNA out to the cytoplasm (Gillespie et al., 2010). Furthermore, the newly synthesised RNA translocates to the CM/PC where it is proposed to undergo translation and proteolytic processing by the viral protease NS2B\u20103 and host signalase (Westaway et al., 1997). CM/PC structures are continuous with the rough ER with the WNV CM/PC containing markers from the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (Mackenzie, Jones, & Westaway, 1999). Interestingly, WNV\u2010infected mammalian and insect cells contain both VP and CM structures (Ng, 1987); however, these structures were only observed in DENV\u2010infected mammalian cells. DENV\u2010infected insect cells contain VPs but do not contain CM structures (Junjhon et al., 2014).",

Furthermore, the process of compartmentalisation increases the local concentration of replicative components, narrows RNA replication and translation to specific sites, acts as a scaffolding for RC anchoring to membranes, and tethers the viral RNA during unwinding (Mackenzie, 2005; Miller & Krijnse\u2010Locker, 2008).

These studies identified host proteins that required for the regulation of the cytoskeleton networks, cell trafficking, RNA processing, host translation, protein modification and degradation, stress response, signal transduction, apoptosis, and lipid metabolism (Krishnan et al., 2008; Marceau et al., 2016; Savidis et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016). Krishnan et al. (2008) identified 305 host proteins that regulate WNV infection of which 283 are host susceptibility factors and 22 are host resistance factors. Interestingly, enrichment of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism regulatory genes were specific to WNV, indicative of the importance of lipid metabolism during WNV replication in mammalian cells (Krishnan et al., 2008).

In the presence of NADPH, FASN primarily synthesises palmitate\u2014a long\u2010chain fatty acid (C 16:0)\u2014from acetyl\u2010CoA and malonyl\u2010CoA (Wakil, 1989). Mart\u00edn\u2010Acebes et al. (2011) showed that WNV replication is dependent on FASN activity by using two FASN inhibitors: cerulenin and C75. Upon infection with WNV, FASN is recruited and localises with the WNV RC. Inhibition of FASN activity attenuates WNV replication, which suggests a preferential requirement of fatty acids in regulating WNV\u2010induced membrane proliferation (Mart\u00edn\u2010Acebes et al., 2011). DENV also requires FASN activity for membrane biogenesis. During DENV infection, FASN is recruited to sites of viral compartments by interacting with the viral NS3 protein, which in turn stimulates the activity of FASN to increase fatty acid biosynthesis (Heaton et al., 2010). Collectively, WNV and DENV preferentially require fatty acid biosynthesis alongside the mevalonate pathways to form the CM/PC and VP. Expression of FASN catalyses the conversion of acetyl\u2010CoA and the generation of palmitoyl\u2010CoA, the first two steps in regulating the fatty acid synthesis pathway (Smith, 1994, Tong, 2005, Heaton et al., 2010). The newly generated fatty acids are modified or incorporated into the ER, thus leading to the expansion of the viral membranes and regulating membrane fluidity and curvature (Heaton et al., 2010). Furthermore, fatty acid biosynthesis together with cholesterol synthesis can aid in viral membrane biosynthesis.",

Cholesterol biosynthesis is regulated within the ER by the sterol regulatory element\u2010binding protein, a membrane\u2010bound transcription factor. Sterol regulatory element\u2010binding proteins play a key role in activating genes that upregulate cholesterol synthesis and uptake, such as 3\u2010hydroxy\u20103\u2010methylglutaryl\u2010CoA reductase (HMGCR) and FASN (Simons & Ikonen, 2000).

(2007) demonstrated that WNV up\u2010regulates cholesterol biosynthesis during infection, and this increase caused a redistribution of cholesterol to the viral RCs. The manipulation of cholesterol levels by reducing HMGCR and altering cellular geranylgeranylated protein concentration drastically reduced viral replication, presumably by reducing HMGCR levels contributing to membrane biogenesis (Mackenzie et al., 2007). In contrast, depletion of intracellular cholesterol with U18666A (a multiaction inhibitor that acts by inhibiting HMGCR activity and the release of cholesterol from late endosome and lysosome [Cenedella, 2009]) inhibits DENV entry and replication by trapping virions in late endosomes/lysosomes; however, the formation of VPs and RCs was not altered (Poh et al., 2012). These results suggest that cholesterol depletion affects WNV and DENV at different stages of their replication cycles and that a combination of multiple lipid classes is involved in the shaping of the VPs. Further, reducing individual lipid components is not sufficient to completely prevent VP formation, and a combined reduction of fatty acids, sterols, and sphingolipids are required.",

Sphingolipids consist of four main members: sphingomyelin, ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine\u20101\u2010phosphate. Due to the central position occupied by ceramide in the sphingolipid pathway, it is considered as the central metabolic hub for sphingolipid biosynthesis and catabolism (Hannun & Obeid, 2008). Removal of phosphorylcholine from sphingomyelin by the hydrolytic activity of acid sphingomyelinase results in the production of ceramide through the sphingomyelinase pathway (Uterm\u00f6hlen, Herz, Schramm, & Kr\u00f6nke, 2008). Ceramide is also synthesised in the ER through the de novo pathway by the catalysis of serine and palmitoyl\u2010CoA by serine\u2010palmitoyl\u2010coenzyme A transferase, which acts as the first committed step in ceramide biosynthesis. Finally, recycling of complex sphingolipids through the salvage pathway can convert sphingosine into ceramide by the enzymatic activity of ceramide synthase (Merrill & Wang, 1992).",

Sphingomyelin does not have the tendency to form membrane curvature due to the phosphorylcholine head group. However, the formation of ceramide by cleaving the phosphorylcholine head group causes a structural change resulting in a cone\u2010shaped lipid structure, which has the tendency to induce spontaneous negative curvature. The presence of ceramide on one leaflet of a lipid bilayer enhances membrane bending (negative curvature) and the tendency to form hexagonal phases II structures (Go\u00f1i & Alonso, 2002; Kr\u00f6nke, 1999; Uterm\u00f6hlen et al., 2008).

JEV and WNV both require ceramide enriched membrane\u2010platforms to enter and egress from cells, respectively. The increase in membrane\u2010bound ceramide by sphingomyelinase treatment significantly increased JEV infection, whereas reduction in ceramide levels had converse effects (Tani et al., 2010). Further, Mart\u00edn\u2010Acebes et al. (2014) demonstrated that WNV virions possess a unique membrane envelope composition enriched in sphingolipids and the reduction of ceramide by inhibiting sphingomyelinase reduced virion release (Mart\u00edn\u2010Acebes et al., 2014). Apart from entry and egress, Perera et al. (2012) suggested that the negative curvature\u2010enhancing lipids such as ceramide may be active in the formation of the membranes induced during DENV infection (Perera et al., 2012). Mass spectrometry analysis on DENV\u2010infected cells revealed that membrane remodelling was directly linked with the induction of unique lipids (such as sphingolipids) during replication where 85% of these lipids were different in viral membranes compared with uninfected cells (Perera et al., 2012). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the down regulation of ceramide has contrary effects on WNV and DENV replication. Reduction of intracellular ceramide levels attenuated WNV replication but enhanced DENV replication (Aktepe et al., 2015). These results suggest that a regulated flux of sphingomyelin\u2010to\u2010ceramide conservation is essential for flavivirus infection, where a regulated balance of sphingolipids is required during specific stages of viral replication.

Both these studies observed a significant decrease in phosphatidylcholine (PChol) abundance with an increase in lyso\u2010PChol. This change is indicative of increased activity of the host enzyme Phospholipase A2, a role that has been recently shown for at least WNV (Liebscher et al., 2018). In contrast to ceramide, lyso\u2010PChol exhibits the capacity to induce positive membrane curvature due to its relatively large hydrophilic head group in relation to its hydrocarbon tail (Fuller & Rand, 2001). Therefore, the combination of ceramide and lyso\u2010PChol to induce both negative and positive curvature would align with the requirements of the invagination from the ER to form the VP. A more recent study has also revealed a highly dynamic regulation of lipid homeostasis in DENV\u2010infected mosquitoes (Chotiwan et al., 2018), which again showed major changes in phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, and sterol lipids. This study additionally showed that the entire repertoire of lipid biochemistry contributes to DENV replication including lipid synthesis, lipolysis, lipid conversion, \u03b2\u2010oxidation, and/or redistribution to provide the optimal lipid environment and platforms facilitating efficient virus replication.",

The insertion of cone shaped ceramide lipids on one leaflet of the lipid bilayer enforces spontaneous negative membrane curvature (Figure 1; Go\u00f1i & Alonso, 2002; Kr\u00f6nke, 1999; Uterm\u00f6hlen et al., 2008). The attenuation observed during WNV replication in the absence of ceramide may be linked to CM/PC and VP abnormalities. Although Perera et al. (2012) suggests that ceramide may be active in the formation of the membranes induced during DENV infection, we have established that depleting endogenous ceramide levels enhanced DENV replication. Unlike WNV, DENV may require diverse classes of lipids to proliferate viral membranes. Additionally, we have demonstrated that both WNV and DENV require RTN3.1A to form viral membranes. Alongside the negative curvature induced by lipids, RTN3.1A inserts into the lipid bilayer to induce positive curvatures to counteract the negative curvature, thus aid in the expansion of the CM/PC and VP (Figure 1). Together, the coalescence of these factors are most likely driven by the association of host and viral proteins within specific membrane platforms (i.e., DNAJC14 within detergent\u2010resistant membranes) to initiate RC formation and stability.",

            "text": "Figure 1: Hypothetical model for the flavivirus replication complex (RC); vesicle packet (VP). Flavivirus infection constructs membrane proliferations termed VPs which house the viral RC. The construction and stability of the RC promotes an exponential increase in viral replication. Translation of viral proteins on the surface of the ER acts as a platform for protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013lipid interactions. Viral proteins interact with DNAJC14, which acts as a chaperone to modulate VP formation (Yi et al., 2011, Yi et al., 2012), potentially on cholesterol\u2010rich microdomains (Mackenzie et al., 2007). We speculate that the viral protein NS4A (based on its predicted topology, structure, and membrane remodelling capacity [Roosendaal et al., 2006, Miller et al., 2007]) induces membrane curvature while interacting with the host RTN3.1A protein (Aktepe et al., 2017). We suggest that the biogenesis and recruitment of the cone\u2010shaped lipids ceramide (Aktepe et al., 2015) and lyso\u2010PChol (Liebscher et al., 2018) stabilises and provides the required curvature for the formation of the VP. Viral and host proteins supporting the VP neck structure (an integral component of the VP that allows for the passage of nucleotides, proteins, and viral RNA) is currently unknown; however, components of the ESCRT complex may be recruited to aid in the stabilisation of the neck (Barajas et al., 2009, Barajas et al., 2014, Diaz et al., 2015)",
