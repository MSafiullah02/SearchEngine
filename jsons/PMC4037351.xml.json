Interferons are classified into three categories, Types I, II and III. The expressions of Type I interferons (IFN\u2010\u03b1 family and IFN\u2010\u03b2) and Type III interferons (IFN\u2010\u03bb family) are directly triggered by virus\u2010induced signalling. In contrast, Type II interferon (IFN\u2010\u03b3) is generally expressed by T cells, NK cells or monocytes in response to cytokines rather than viral particles 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Type I and III interferons are expressed in several cell types, including but not limited to bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts and plasmacytoid dendritic cells 12, 13, 14. The interferons initiate a robust antiviral response impairing virus replication and cell\u2010to\u2010cell spread of virus. Additionally, some but not all studies have suggested an association of asthma and interferon deficiency, which may predispose an individual to virus\u2010induced exacerbations of asthma 14, 15, 16, 17.",

For example, analyses of in vitro cell cultures (primary bronchial epithelial cells, monocytes and alveolar macrophages derived from asthma patients) infected with HRV have shown diminished IFN\u2010\u03bb, \u03b1, \u03b3 and \u03b2 responses compared to cells derived from control non\u2010asthma patients 15, 17, 33, 34, 35.

For asthma patients not currently experiencing an exacerbation or viral infection, sputum gene expression of IFN\u2010\u03bb1 (IL\u201029) inversely correlated with their asthma symptom scores 28.

IFN\u2010\u03b3 protein levels in nasal lavage samples from atopic asthma patients and healthy controls exhibited comparable increases during experimental HRV\u201016 inoculation 5. Interestingly, one study reported that asthma symptoms were related to both lower expression of IFN\u2010\u03bb1 mRNA and increased expression of IFN\u2010\u03bb2 (IL\u201028) in sputum cells 28. In addition, IFN\u2010\u03bb protein and mRNA expression in upper airway respiratory secretions were increased in wheezing adolescents during a viral infection compared to non\u2010wheezers and correlated with the severity of wheezing illness 37. Our data are consistent with the latter findings, as we have shown increased lower airway expression of IFN\u2010\u03b2 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 in those experiencing an exacerbation. Furthermore, IFN\u2010\u03b3, IFN\u2010\u03b21 and IFN\u2010\u03b11 show significant correlations with quantification of asthma symptom severity as measured by the peak Asthma Index. These data suggest the possibility that a vigorous interferon response during a viral respiratory infection could contribute to the development and severity of an asthma exacerbation. Conceptually, the interferon expression may serve two roles: first, at onset of viral exposure, interferons may protect from severe infection; second, once infection has occurred, interferons may contribute to promoting the inflammatory cascade in the airway contributing to increased asthma symptoms.",

We examined asthma patients with naturally occurring viral infections. Finally, we utilized a quantitative measure of asthma symptom severity, the Asthma Index, which incorporates both subjective and objective measures of control. It is notable that our gene expression data for IL\u201010, MBP and IL\u201013 are consistent with published observations on the protein expression of these and related products in the airway 24, 26, 27, 38, 39, which provides validation for the use of sputum cell gene expression as a surrogate biomarker for the respective cytokine or mediator.",

Therefore, the changes in mRNA expression may be the result of either increased transcription per cell or fluctuations in cellular composition. Also, our analysis focused on gene expression, and confirmatory studies of protein secretion are needed. On the other hand, use of RT\u2010PCR is a very sensitive method of quantifying gene expression, and it is possible that many proteins that cannot be detected in sputum (either due to low levels of protein expression or lack of sensitive/specific reagents) can readily be assessed by mRNA levels. Additionally, as sputum cell samples mainly consist of leucocytes, our data may not reflect changes in epithelial cell gene expression.",
