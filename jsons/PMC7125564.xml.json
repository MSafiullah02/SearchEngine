            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the prototype species of the family Coronaviridae, causes an acute and highly contagious disease of chickens. Numerous IBV strains exist, and clinical signs of the disease they cause vary from mild to severe. More than 20 IBV serotypes have been recognized worldwide, which are defined by cross-reactivity among the structural proteins Cowen and Hitchner, 1975, Hopkins, 1974. Live vaccines containing strains of IBV from multiple serotypes are routinely used in commercial chicken flocks. Disease outbreaks in commercial flocks occur when new viruses emerge from existing viruses by mutations, insertions, deletions, or recombination Cavanagh et al., 1992, Gelb et al., 1991, Kusters et al., 1990. However, because these conclusions are based on available sequence from structural genes, viral evolution has only been described for this small part of the genome. Because only two IBVs have been fully sequenced, it has been impossible to fully understand the viral evolutionary process including the extent to which vaccine viruses have contributed genetic material to pathogenic field strains.",

            "text": "Six subgenomic (sg) mRNA species are transcribed from the IBV genome in virus-infected cells. This includes a genome-length mRNA (mRNA 1) of 27.6 kb and five sg species (mRNA 2\u20136) with sizes ranging from 2 to 7 kb. These mRNAs form a 3\u2032-co-terminal nested structure (Stern and Sefton, 1984), each containing a short nontranslated leader sequence (64 nucleotides (nt)), derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome by a discontinuous process. The phenomenon of leader switching has been described for several coronaviruses including IBV Chang et al., 1994, Makino et al., 1988, Stirrups et al., 2000. The mRNA 1 contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF 1a and 1b) encoding 441- and 300-kDa polyproteins, respectively (Boursnell et al., 1987). By a unique frameshifting mechanism, the downstream ORF 1b is produced as a fusion protein of 741 kDa with 1a Brierley et al., 1987, Brierley et al., 1989. These polyproteins are proteolytically processed into smaller products required for RNA synthesis and other aspects of viral replication. Four main structural proteins are encoded by sgmRNAs: the spike (S) glycoprotein (mRNA 2), the small envelope (E) protein (mRNA 3), the membrane (M) glycoprotein (mRNA 4), and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (mRNA 6) Lai, 1990, Spaan et al., 1988, Sutou et al., 1988. The S1 fragment of the spike protein carries antigenic epitopes that induce virus-neutralizing (VN) antibody, and also determines virus serotype Cavanagh and Davis, 1986, Cavanagh et al., 1986.",

Proteolytic processing of the polyproteins by equivalent protease activities has been demonstrated in murine and human coronaviruses (reviewed in Lim et al., 2000, Ng and Liu, 2000). Despite the conservation of function, there are some organizational differences in PLpro domains between IBV and some other coronaviruses Herold et al., 1993, Lee et al., 1991. Because of its key role in replicase gene expression, 3C-LP has been termed the coronavirus main protease (Mpro; Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The IBV PLpro domain-1 (PL1pro), encoded between nt 4243 and 5019 (aa 1239\u20131497), is responsible for cleavage of the N-terminal regions of 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins in IBV-infected cells, whereas the PLpro domain-2 (PL2pro) encoded between nt 4681\u20135553 (aa 1385\u20131675) is reported to be functionally inactive in IBV Lim and Liu, 1998, Lim et al., 2000, Liu et al., 1995. A more important role in the processing of polyproteins is played by the Mpro, which is responsible for the cleavage of other regions of the ORF 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins Liu et al., 1994, Liu et al., 1997, Liu et al., 1998, Ng and Liu, 1998, Ng and Liu, 2002. The catalytic center of both proteinases consists of His and Cys residues in all coronaviruses (reviewed in Lim et al., 2000, Ng and Liu, 2000). The processed products constitute a group of replicative enzymes, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA helicase. Therefore, the significance of the coronavirus leader sequence and several putative functional domains essential for viral replication made them logical choices for sequence analysis and phylogenetic comparisons to correlate with the serological or pathological classification of coronaviruses.",

One report has described the alignment of the 5\u2032-proximal region of replicase genes from a limited number of IBV strains (Stirrups et al., 2000), and a few reports describe IBV Mpro and RdRp domains from the Beaudette strain only Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002, Stephensen et al., 1999. Here, we have sequenced four regions of the replicase gene corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal end, PLpro, Mpro, and RdRp domains from 20 heterologous IBV strains, and compared then with previously published IBV and other coronavirus sequences. We present evidence that (i) the Mpro and RdRp regions are highly conserved among all coronaviruses unlike the 5\u2032-terminal sequence and PLpro domains, (ii) the clustering of heterologous IBV strains based on the replicase gene sequences does not correlate with the antigen-based S1 phylogeny, (iii) several widely used IBV vaccines and field strains isolated over the past decade have closely related replicase genes suggestive of a possible common ancestry or a converging evolution, and (iv) the replicase gene is unlikely to be the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses fall into three antigenic groups (Dea et al., 1990), which are defined by cross-reactivity among the structural proteins. Unlike the structural proteins, the coronavirus replicase gene is not subjected to immune selective pressure. Therefore, one would expect that the replicase gene would be highly conserved among coronavirus groups. In fact, this is the case when the Mpro and RdRp sequences are compared (Table 3) and as others have reported for other coronavirus groups Chouljenko et al., 2001, Gonzalez et al., 2003, Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002, Stephensen et al., 1999. We found a high percentage of sequence similarities in coronavirus Mpro (with 28% absolutely conserved residues), including the substrate recognition site, and an even higher similarity in the RdRp (with 48% absolutely conserved residues), including the polymerase motifs. However, two-way sequence comparisons of the coronavirus 5\u2032-termini and the PLpro domains of ORF1a had very low sequence identity between coronaviruses of different groups as has been reported by others (Herold et al., 1999). Despite the fact that these regions have varying degrees of genetic diversity, the relationships between the coronaviruses of different groups are the same, no matter what region of the genome is compared. When recombination occurs (Cavanagh and Davis, 1988), it would seem to occur within the major coronaviruses antigenic groups, but not between them. This is expected because in order for recombination to occur, two viruses must be present in the same cell, which is unlikely between coronaviruses adapted to different host species. The highly conserved Mpro-mediated processing pathways as well as the substrate binding sites of this enzyme in all coronaviruses Anand et al., 2003, Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002 make this proteinase an attractive target for the development of drugs directed against coronaviruses. The active domains of RdRp also maintain a high degree of homology among all coronaviruses, as has been found in other RNA viruses Koonin and Dolja, 1993, Otsuka et al., 1999, making this proteinase another potential target for drugs controlling coronaviruses.",

For example, unlike the S1 genes, the replicase genes of the Ma5 and H52 Mass serotype viruses consistently clustered with those of non-Mass strains (Figs. 2a\u2013d). The common clustering of replicase genes of these heterologous IBV strains could be due to an introduction of a replicase gene from a common source through introduction. Others have speculated that IBV strains substitute large genomic fragments in multiple genes (Lee and Jackwood, 2000) because the viability of the progeny viruses depends on the specific interactions of more than one gene working in concert to maintain structural and replicative integrity. Alternatively, it is probably more likely that the smaller S1 genes are exchanged between viruses through recombination and the stable replicase backbone is maintained. It is entirely possible that recombination events have occurred to introduce new replicase or new S1 genes into these viruses.",

The phenomenon of leader switching involves a recombination event over a region comprising the leader sequence and the adjacent 5\u2032 UTR (Chang et al., 1996). Previous reports have suggested that the leader sequences of IBV strains may contain higher (17.2%) substitution rates when compared to the complete 5\u2032 UTR (4.3%; Stirrups et al., 2000). In our study, the 5\u2032 UTR of all 22 IBV strains are highly conserved (94\u2013100% identity), indicating the exchange of leader or adjacent 5\u2032 UTR fragments has occurred in mixed infections. This observation is supported by experimental evidence of the exchange of leader sequences among heterologous IBV strains (Stirrups et al., 2000) and in mixed MHV infections (Makino et al., 1986). The sequence comparison scores are more variable in the N-terminal coding region (Table 1), and the most in PLpro domains (Table 2) including a more variable region in the latter (Fig. 3) than the IBV Mpro and RdRp domains (Table 3). The reason for sequence variation in the N-terminal half of ORF1a among IBV strains is not clear.",

We speculate that there are some replicase genotypes that may confer a selective advantage to the virus. We examined both the 5\u2032 terminal region and the PLpro gene by year and location of isolation, but excluded the Mpro and RdRp genes because they are so highly conserved that no clear differences between isolates can be discerned. In the 5\u2032 terminal region and the PLpro gene, the IBV strains isolated from commercial chickens over the past decade cluster with three specific vaccine virus strains, ArkDPI, H52, and Ma5, no matter where in the United States they were isolated. There are three exceptions to this clustering, the 5\u2032 terminal region of the Gray virus isolated in 1960 (Winterfield and Hitchner, 1962) clusters with modern field strains (Fig. 2a), although its PLpro gene is more like the Conn and Florida reference viruses isolated in 1956 and 1971, respectively Jungherr et al., 1956, Winterfield et al., 1971\n(Fig. 2b). In addition, there are two modern field isolates, one from China (BJ) and one from California (K1699) isolated in 2003 and 2001, respectively, that are outliers and do not appear to have 5\u2032 termini or PLpro genes that are related to other viruses (Figs. 2a and b). This common clustering of three widely used vaccines and IBV field isolates from the past decade suggests to us that there may be a common evolutionary progression in the 5\u2032 terminal region and in the PLpro gene. Although the 5\u2032 terminal region genotype found in modern isolates was present in 1960, when the Gray virus was isolated, it appears to be more prevalent today. The question arises as to why this type of progression to a specific genotype would have occurred and how it could have happened. As to the question of why, we speculate that the more modern genotype must offer some fitness advantage to the virus. As to how it could have occurred, we consider the widespread use of multiple types of modified live vaccines in both the broiler and egg layer commercial poultry industries as the possible mechanism by which this modern replicase gene genotype was introduced. The Ark, Conn, and Mass (Ma5, H52) strains have been used simultaneously as live vaccines among commercial poultry (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). Although we cannot prove or disprove that recombination has occurred, we can point to the evolutionary trends in the S1 gene as compared to the evolutionary trends in the replicase gene. The trends in S1 evolution have been toward ever increasing diversity (Jia et al., 2002), while it appears that the replicase gene is evolving to less variety between isolates. These juxtaposed evolutionary trends suggest that (1) these two regions are under very different selective pressures and thus undergo much different rates and modes of change, and (2) the exchange of genetic material may have occurred between vaccine strains and field isolates.",

In our study, there were no differences in any essential residues in Mpro and RdRp domains. In addition, we found that there was no clear relationship between viral pathotype and replicase genotype. As an example, the H52 vaccine strain is very closely related to the virulent DE072 isolate in all regions of the replicase (99.8% identity in the 5\u2032 terminus, 99.5% in PLpro, 99.3% in Mpro, 99.6% in RdRp) despite their differences in pathotype. In addition, a direct comparison of the replicase genes of the M41 challenge and vaccine strains where there were very few aa differences between the two strains with clearly different pathotypes. None of the aa changes between the two M41 strains were consistently observed in either all virulent or all avirulent strains.

The selected regions of the replicase genes were amplified with primers synthesized from conserved regions designed by aligning IBV Beaudette sequence and sequences from other coronaviruses. The PCR profiles involved an initial denaturation for 4 min at 94 \u00b0C followed by 35 cycles of annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and melting at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min.
