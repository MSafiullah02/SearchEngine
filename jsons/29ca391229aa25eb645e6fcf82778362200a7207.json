This is the number of cases generated in the current population at a moment in time, but it does not assume complete susceptibility in the population. The effective reproduction ratio can change with vaccination. Both R 0 and R are not solely determined by the pathogen, although the pathogen, of course, has a large impact. Other factors such as population density, behavior patterns, and interventions can change R. For most situations when R > 1 the infection will be able to spread within a population, while if R < 1 it will not be able to spread. Estimates of the median daily reproduction number in Wuhan declined from 2.35 before travel restrictions to 1.05 after travel restrictions. 1 Other investigators have estimated R to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-3.9). 1, 5 Over time R will hopefully decrease as interventions take effect. In the prior severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2003, R was estimated initially at 2.75 but with interventions, R dropped <1 rapidly.",

            "text": "However, the previous SARS epidemic also demonstrates another important point, namely that even when R was <1, super-spreader events occurred and the epidemic continued. In Toronto, most early SARS cases occurred in hospitals, with the movement of SARS patients between hospitals contributing to the outbreak. 6, 7 In Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, transmission often occurred through transmission in hospital wards. While the typical infected patient transmitted to <1 other patient, occasional outliers transmitted to multiple individuals (threshold value defining a super-spreader was 8 in SARS). 8 How can we apply the epidemiology and the lessons from the SARS epidemic to bronchoscopy? Screening based on symptoms, even in the best case scenario, is not sensitive. If a routine bronchoscopy patient (eg, for a lung nodule) is infected but asymptomatic and therefore remains undetected, then health care providers will be unprotected. Now, this is true in many areas of health care delivery, not just the bronchoscopy laboratory. But unlike other areas of health care, the act of bronchoscopy is likely to increase the probability of transmission to bronchoscopy personnel due to respiratory droplets. That same bronchoscopy personnel provide care to other particularly vulnerable patients every day, setting up a super-spreader situation since infected individuals have close contact with a particularly vulnerable population with frequent comorbidities, including cancer and immunosuppression. 9, 10 In addition, data is still scant on whether SARS-CoV-2 can survive outside the body for long. The coronavirus that caused Middle East respiratory syndrome demonstrated the ability to survive outside the body for up to 60 minutes. A report of a cluster of 19 cases in a shopping mall suggests that the virus might have spread via indirect transmission, but the evidence is not definitive at this time. 11 One possible step to at least partially address this risk is to test all patients before undergoing any type of bronchoscopy and/or increase the level of health care provider protection in the bronchoscopy area. This, of course, is only possible once testing becomes more widely available such that all other higher priority patients can be tested. Another intervention is to consider delaying elective cases when possible. The available data suggests that for diagnosis and staging of cancer a brief delay could be implemented without much adverse impact. 12 In the absence of widely available testing, one option would be to implement a 2-week delay combined with self-quarantine for elective cancer diagnosis and staging cases. Patients who remain asymptomatic would have their elective bronchoscopy. After a brief 2-week downtime, the daily flow of elective cancer cases would return to more normal levels so that delays in cancer care would not be excessive while balancing the need for containment of the pandemic. Which interventions to implement and when to implement them will be context-dependent, depending in large part on the prevalence of the disease in each locale and the available resources, so individualization to each particular hospital's context is important.",

But good decisions are based on an assessment of probabilities and consequences. A rare event with disastrous consequences warrants a different decision threshold. 13 Super-spreader events provide insight into the probabilities and consequences in this context. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the health care environment is always a concern because of the vulnerable population we serve. But the risk of transmission to staff is even higher in the bronchoscopy area and the consequences would be worse than in other health care settings.

This will require additional data collection and analysis as well as timely and prudent decision making that incorporates not only probabilities but consequences as well.
