Recent developments are presented so that the clinician may provide evidence-based, high-quality patient care. Recent Findings New resistance patterns in cutaneous pathogens have recently emerged as a result of inappropriate antimicrobial use. Several new FDA-approved antimicrobials have been approved to treat such infections, including multi-drug resistant pathogens. Several organizational guidelines for cutaneous infection management have been updated with new recommendations for screening, diagnostic, and treatment strategies. Summary Clinicians should be aware of the most recent evidence and guidelines for the management of cutaneous infections in order to reduce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and most effectively treat their patients.",

Overall, SSTIs have a higher incidence than urinary tract infections and pneumonia combined and has been steadily rising [1\u2022] . Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the incidence of SSTIs presumably due to the aging population, increase in number of immunocompromised people, and the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens [2] . Data from 2012 showed that the total cost of SSTIs in the USA alone was $13.8 billion, mostly due to hospitalizations [3] . Clearly, cutaneous infections and their management are a significant health and financial burden and providers should be educated on the most recent developments in order to provide effective, evidence-based care for their patients.",

SSTI antibiotic resistance can mainly be attributed to antibiotic overuse; resistance has been demonstrated with multiple topical antibiotics such as fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin [6, 7, 8\u2022\u2022] . Several studies have shown that there is limited clinical data to support the widespread use of topical antibiotics in preventing infection or promoting wound healing following uncomplicated minor wounds with the exception of impetigo and nasal decolonization of S. aureus [8\u2022\u2022, 9] . Indeed, a 2015 meta-analysis concluded that nasal mupirocin may have a significant protective effect against MRSA skin infections [10] .

Additionally, women with herpetic breast lesions are advised not to breastfeed from affected breast until resolution of lesion [77] .

One study found that a subset of Meckel cell carcinoma patients (19%) was MCPyV negative and had an increased risk of death compared to those with positive serologies [93] . In another study of 219 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma, 52% were seropositive for antibodies to MCPyV oncoproteins. Seropositivity at the time of diagnosis was found to independently predict decreased disease recurrence. For those who are seropositive, rising antibody titer surveillance may be a useful early indicator of recurrence [94] .",

It is evident that the emergence of resistant strains of microorganisms in all categories described, whether it be bacteria, fungi or viruses, has driven the discovery and production of new antimicrobials which are now at the disposal of the provider. Additionally, new guidelines on treatment as well as prevention strategies are able to aid providers of how to effectively combat this resistance and provide better outcomes for their patients. Advances in diagnostics technology have also become available which can provide an accurate determination of causative agents leading to more directed therapies and potentially reduce the frequency of empiric treatment. Readers should take note of new emerging infections and newly described presentations which they may encounter in their practice. As research advances in this field, new discoveries will continue to change our understanding of basic science as well as clinical management of cutaneous infections in order to provide the most effective and safe care to patients who will be afflicted by them.",
