            "text": "Cell entry of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is mediated by the interaction of its spike (S) protein and cellular receptor carcinoembryonic antigen adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1, MHVR). However, a highly neurotropic MHV, wild-type (wt) JHMV is known to spread to receptor-negative BHK cells from firstly infected receptor-positive DBT cells (MHVR-independent infection). 1 Although the mechanism of this infection is still unclear, it is hypothesized that the S protein attached on cell surface is activated for fusion by natural dissociation of S1 from S2, which was revealed in wt JHMV but not mutants derived from it, 2 with or without MHVR-independent infection activity, respectively. 3, 4 Wild-type JHMV fails to infect BHK cells by a standard infection procedure, because the virus is not able to attach cells without MHVR. However, the S protein expressed on cell surface infected with wt can attach onto MHVR-negative cells by overlaying these cells, which induces fusion/infection of MHVR deficient cells (infected-cell overlay test). If MHVR-independent infection occurs as expected above, then we will be able to make wt JHMV infect cells by attaching virions onto cells without MHVR. To test this possibility, we employed the spinoculation method, which has been shown to facilitate the binding of 5 Two strains of JHMV, cl-2 and its soluble receptor resistant mutant, srr7, 6 were used for spinoculation. There is only one single amino-acid substitution in the S2 subunit of srr7 as compared with cl-2. They were spinoculated onto BHK cells, which facilitated the attachment of these viruses to the same extent. It also facilitated the infection of cl-2 virus but not that of srr7, being in good agreement with the result obtained by infected-cell overlay test. Furthermore, dissociation of S1 from S2 was confirmed in cells expressing",

The centrifugation had small effects on virus infection (23-fold increase compared with no-centrifuged plate), when DBT cells were infected with cl-2. In contrast, cl-2 infection of receptor-deficient BHK cells was extensively (ca. 800-fold) increased by centrifugation, while virus hardly infected BHK cells without centrifugation (2.75 syncytia per well). On the other hand, no syncytium formation was observed in BHK cells spinoculated with JHMV srr7, while an increase in infection similar to cl-2 was observed in DBT cells. We then examined whether spinoculation increased the attachment of the viruses or not. Real-time PCR showed that attachment of both cl-2 and srr7 was increased significantly by spinoculation in both DBT and BHK cells (data not shown). These data suggest that spinouclation increased attachment to MHVR-negative cells regardless of viruses used, however, only cl-2 infected those cells as shown in Table 1 . This result is in good agreement with the MHVR-independent infection observed by the infected-cell overlay test, suggesting that localization of cl-2 S protein in close proximity is an important condition for MHVR-independent infection.",
