For example, TLR 2 recognizes various ligands expressed by Gram-positive bacteria, whereas TLR 3 engages dsRNA and TLR 4 is specific for Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharides (LPS; Alexopoulou et al., 2001, Campos et al., 2001, Johnson et al., 2002, Opitz et al., 2001). TLR 5, on the other hand, recognizes bacterial flagellin, while TLRs 7 and 8 interact with antiviral compounds and TLR 9 binds bacterial DNA Bauer et al., 2001, Gewirtz et al., 2001, Ito et al., 2002. Recently, TLRs were observed to influence the development of the adaptive immune response presumably through the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC; Schjetne et al., 2003). The most compelling evidence comes from studies on dendritic cells (Banchereau et al., 2003). It has previously been shown that multiple TLRs are found on dendritic cells. Signaling through these receptors augments antigen presentation by driving cell maturation, up-regulating expression of costimulatory molecules on the cell, and inducing cytokines (Palucka and Banchereau, 2002). Thus, TLRs may serve as a unique link between innate and adaptive immunity.",

Inherited retinal degenerative diseases can be associated with mutations of RPE cellular genes Hamel et al., 1993, Morimura et al., 1998, Morimura et al., 1999. Moreover, degenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, can be associated with early damage to the RPE cell Cai et al., 2000, Lutty et al., 1999. In addition, a variety of in vivo and in vitro studies have identified this cell as an ideal target for infectious agents such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Toxoplasma gondii and coronavirus Detrick et al., 1996, Detrick et al., 2001, Hooks et al., 1993, Nagineni et al., 2000, Nagineni et al., 2002. Furthermore, this cell is a rich source of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that may contribute to or limit pathologic processes Chin et al., 2001, Momma et al., 2003. Recently, the RPE cell has been shown to play a pivotal role in the immune system. It has been demonstrated that interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) treatment up-regulates the expression of both MHC class-I and -II molecules on RPE cells (Percopo et al., 1990). Moreover, RPE cells have been reported to act as APC in the retina (Percopo et al., 1990). Hence, RPE cells can incorporate pathogens, produce a variety of cytokines, and present pathogen-derived peptides to sensitized T cells. This finding, that RPE cells function as APC in the retina, extends the activities of this cell beyond its participation as a first line defense cell and underscores its important role in adaptive immunity. Therefore, based on these observations, it was of interest to further define the role of this epithelial cell in innate and adaptive immune responses within the retina.",

The results of this study demonstrate that RPE cells do indeed constitutively express distinct types of TLRs and that their expressions are modulated in the presence of dsRNA and cytokines. TLR 3 is a receptor for dsRNA, and dsRNA is a common replication intermediate for many viruses. Moreover, TLR 3 has been described as a specific TLR because it displays the most restricted cellular expression pattern (Janssens and Beyaert, 2003). Because TLR 3 gene expression was identified in RPE cells and because the RPE cells are a site of replication for both RNA and DNA viruses, we further investigated TLR 3 signaling in these cells. Our data suggest that the binding of poly I:C, an analog of dsRNA, to TLR 3 on human RPE cells resulted in the production of IFN-\u03b2 and other cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Thus, TLR 3 signaling within the retina may provide additional protective molecules to mediate viral infections.",

As seen in Fig. 5A\u2013D\n, supernatant fluids from untreated RPE cells did not contain IL-6 or IL-8 and only very low levels of MCP-1 and sICAM-1.

Following poly I:C treatment at 2, 20, or 100 \u03bcg/ml, the concentration of IL-6 increased from 40 to 80 ng/ml, IL-8 increased from 9 to 29 ng/ml, MCP-1 increased from 50 to 160 ng/ml, and sICAM-1 increased from 2.5 to 8 ng/ml. In contrast, treatment of RPE cells under similar conditions with poly dI:dC did not enhance the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and sICAM-1 (Fig. 5).",

Furthermore, human RPE cells highly expressed TLR 3. Protein expression for TLRs 2, 3 and 4 was also observed on RPE cells and this expression was augmented by treatment with poly I:C or IFN-\u03b3. Because TLR 3 is found on a limited number of cells and was highly expressed in RPE cells, we performed studies to analyze signaling through TLR 3. The interaction of poly I:C with RPE cells resulted in the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 as well as IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and sICAM-1. Moreover, we show that IFN-\u03b2 is highly effective in inhibiting virus replication in RPE cells. Specificity for TLR 3 signaling was demonstrated by the inhibition of poly I:C induction of IFN-\u03b2 by pretreatment of RPE cells with anti-TLR 3 antibody.",

Recently, it has been demonstrated that these epithelial cells contain several TLRs and respond to microbes by secreting cytokines and chemokines. For example, a murine intestinal epithelial cell line is highly responsive to LPS and expresses both TLR 4 and CD14. Corneal epithelial cells have been reported to express TLR 4 and CD14, and the LPS treatment of these cells resulted in the secretion of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Song et al., 2001). Like other epithelial cells, the RPE cell can also be considered as a front line defense against invading organisms. It is strategically located between the neural retina and the blood-rich choroid. The RPE forms a barrier, limiting access to photoreceptors and other neuronal cells within the retina. Earlier studies by our laboratory and others have revealed that RPE cells can be stimulated to produce a variety of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules Elner et al., 1990, Elner et al., 1992, Momma et al., 2003, Nagineni et al., 1994. In this report, we show that RPE cells possess a variety of TLRs and the costimulatory molecules, CD14 and MD2 (Tabeta et al., 2000). TLR 2 and TLR 4 are the most widely studied members of the TLR family Johnson et al., 2002, Faure et al., 2000, Opitz et al., 2001. Both of these TLRs were found on the RPE cell. Thus, RPE cells may defend against infections by sensing microbial invasion through multiple TLRs and the costimulatory molecules, CD14 and MD2.",

Earlier studies demonstrate that TLR 3 is constitutively expressed on intestinal epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and mast cells Cario and Podolsky, 2000, Muzio et al., 2000. The dendritic cell is a potent antigen-presenting cell that expresses multiple TLRs including TLR 3 Banchereau et al., 2003, Jarrossay et al., 2001. Several studies suggest that TLR signaling on dendritic cells amplifies antigen presentation by producing proinflammatory cytokines, up-regulating co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD40, CD80, and CD86, and by increasing migration of cells to the lymph node (Palucka and Banchereau, 2002). The dendritic cell and the RPE cell share some common features. Both cells express TLR 3 and are APC. The dendritic cell responds to TLR 3 signaling by producing both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, whereas the RPE cell produces only IFN-\u03b2. This difference is probably a reflection of different cellular origins. Presently, dendritic cells are considered to be of bone marrow origin while RPE cells are of neural ectoderm origin. Additional studies are required to determine if the TLRs on the RPE cell also can augment APC functions.",

Specificity for dsRNA interactions with TLR 3 was demonstrated by Matsumoto et al. (2002). Their studies pointed out that poly I:C-induced IFN-\u03b2 was suppressed by pretreatment with monoclonal antibody to TLR 3. Additional studies on TLR 3 knockout mice revealed that poly I:C treatment up-regulated the production of type-1 IFNs (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2) in wild-type mice but not in TLR 3 KO mice (Alexopoulou et al., 2001). In this report, we demonstrate that the poly I:C treatment of human RPE cells results in the production and release of IFN-\u03b2 and not IFN-\u03b1. Moreover, these RPE cells are highly sensitive to the antiviral actions of human IFN-\u03b2. Clearly, dsRNA-mediated signaling in RPE cells can have a protective role in viral infections in the retina. In light of this, numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have identified that RPE cells are one of the principle targets for infectious agents, such as CMV, T. gondii, and murine coronaviruses Bodaghi et al., 1999, Detrick et al., 2001, Hooks et al., 1993, Nagineni et al., 1996.
