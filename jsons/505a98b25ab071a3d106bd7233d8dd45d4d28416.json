It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with significant mortality and morbidity rate. The severe risk factors are commonly detected in patients of older age and with medical comorbidities like cancer and diabetes. Scientists and doctors have scrambled to gain knowledge about the novel virus and its pathophysiology in order to discover possible therapeutic regimens and vaccines for COVID-19. The therapeutic strategies like targeting the viral genome emphasize the promising approach to target COVID-19. Additionally, blocking the receptor, ACE2 via the neutralizing antibodies for viral escape that prevents it from entering into the cells provides another therapeutic regimen. In this review article, we have presented the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in comorbid patients and discussed organ failure caused by this virus. Based on the data available from the scientific literature and ongoing clinical trials, we have focused on therapeutic strategies. We hope that we would fill the gaps that puzzled the researchers and clinicians with the best of our knowledge collected for the betterment of the patients for the coming future.

It has 4 structural proteins, including envelope, spike, nucleocapsid and membrane. They are comprised of the functional subunits S1 and S2, which are responsible for detecting ACE2 receptors present on the host cells. ACE2 receptors are utilized by the virus to enter the host cells [6] [7] [8] . ACE2 expression is detected on type I and type II alveolar epithelium, upper respiratory system, heart, kidney tubular epithelium, pancreas, endothelial cells and enterocytes. Thus, the external spike protein determines the infectious nature and host specificity of SARS-CoV-2. The host cells allow the entry of the virus through the process called endocytosis. Moreover, the transmembrane proximal serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is the host protein that facilitates the entry of the virus through the S protein [5, 9] . Additionally, it is involved in priming the S protein and potentiates the cleavage of the spike (Fig.1 ).",

The genome of the virus encodes various non-structural proteins like papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the coronavirus main protease, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) [10, 11] . The virus then hijacks the machinery of the cell to synthesize the viral polypeptides that encode for the replicase transcriptase complex. The active virus produces RNA through RdRp. Moreover, PLpro actively deubiquitinases certain immune regulator cells like IF3 and NF-\u03baB to suppress the immune response [11, 12] . It uses the endoplasmic reticulum to synthesize M and S proteins, which are essential for its outer capsule. The viral proteinases 3CLpro and PLpro more effectively cleave the viral polyproteins with the help of the host translation machinery [10, 11] . They produce new spikes and glycoproteins that are assembled into numerous copies of the virus. After replication of the genetic material, the golgi bodies exocytose the viruses, which then attack other cells. The created stress on the endoplasmic reticulum by the virus also induces apoptosis of the healthy host cells after releasing millions of viral copies. The viruses continue to attack other cells or end up as droplets and enter the lungs [13] . As an immune response, a fever is generated as the host's immune system fights to clear the virus out of the body. Pro-inflammatory chemokines are activated to produce inflammatory cells. CD4+ T helper cells develop immunity against SARS-CoV-2 by producing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 [14] . SARS-CoV-2 also targets these circulating immune cells and induces apoptosis of CD3, CD8 and CD4 cells, causing lymphocytopenia [15] [16] [17] [18] . This results in the overproduction of cytokines, causing a cytokine storm as it is released from the inhibition of innate immunity. The cytokine storm results in hyper inflammation, ultimately causing failure of multiple organs [19] [20] [21] . For instance, under severe conditions, a patient's immune system can attack the lung cells. This results in fluid filling the lungs and cell apoptosis, causing difficulty in breathing. In some cases, this leads to death. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported critically ill cases of viral pneumonia. Later, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) identified the virus as SARS-CoV-2 [26] . The Chinese government then mandated a quarantine to control the epidemic stage and to determine the effectiveness of a quarantine against the virus [27] . However, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted rapidly, quickly crossing borders of various countries. Thus, the number of established cases climbed quickly, causing the WHO to announce COVID-19 a global pandemic disease on March 11, 2020. Initially, China had the most confirmed cases, followed by North America and Europe. Italy and the US, however, surpassed China in terms of the number of established cases. Thus, at this stage of vigorous spread, it is essential to determine the mechanism of viral infection to control and treat the disease. Until now, it was believed that bat, especially Rhinolophus affinis, was the natural host of the virus [7] . It is still uncertain how this virus was transmitted from bat to human, although some research has suggested that pangolin (Manis javanica) could be the intermediate host [14, 28, 29] . The aggressive intervention steps were taken by governments, such as isolating and quarantining latent patients, have reduced the contact rate and effectively decreased the peak for COVID-19 cases.",

About 23% of COVID-19 ill patients had cardiac injury [17] , and 13% showed an elevation in creatinine kinase [35] . The mRNA and protein ACE2 expression levels are higher in these patients with cardiac disease, creating an increased risk for severe COVID-19 complications, including heart failure. Moreover, it was also suggested by Liang Chen et al. that the human heart infected with SARS-CoV-2 attacks pericytes, resulting in microvascular disorders [36] . This microvascular disorder causes J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f dysfunction in capillary endothelial cells, low microvascular reactivity and high vascular permeability. The modelling and docking results also showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a receptor-binding domain that fits well with human ACE2 receptors. Moreover, the amino acid residues including 491Tyr, 441Leu, 479Gln, 487Asn, 472Phe and 480Ser of the SARS-CoV-2 mature spike protein are involved in binding with the ACE2 receptor [36] . Thus, these amino acid residues in the binding domain are important to consider in the design of potential drug treatments. Taken together, these findings show that COVID-19 in patients with cardiovascular disease often results in a critical condition and death.",

Most of these patients were male, older, or had other illnesses. Additionally, 13.1% had elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). After hospitalization (10 days), the serum creatinine peak elevated to 91\u00b167 \u03bcmol/L, and about 43.9% of the patients showed proteinuria. These patients also showed a higher incidence of AKI (11.9%) after hospitalization; only 5.1% had AKI during admission. The in-hospital mortality recorded was 16.1%; however, those with raised baseline serum creatinine had a mortality rate of 33.7%. Furthermore, the Univariate Cox regression analysis also showed that COVID-19 patients who were male and/or older than 65 were highly prone to in-hospital death. Therefore, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f clinicians must be aware of kidney diseases in COVID-19 patients after hospitalization as early diagnosis and effective treatment would reduce the death rate in patients.",

            "text": "This suggests that DM is the predominant comorbidity with COVID-19. A few mechanisms have been suggested by researchers to explain the high susceptible of DM patients to COVID-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 19 pathogenesis. These include having an efficient cellular binding and easy entry of the virus, low chance for viral clearance, weakened T-cell function, highly prone to cytokine storm and hyperinflammation. Additionally, ACE2 expression weakens with the administration of insulin [48, 49] , whereas ACE2 expression is upregulated by hypoglycemic agents like thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptides-1, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, antihypertensives and statins [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . The rodent DM model showed higher expression ACE2 in heart, lung, kidney and pancreas compared with normal controls [48, 49] . Furthermore, Rao et al [55] . from their Mendelian randomization study determined from the diseases and traits that the lungs of DM patient showed increased expression of ACE2. The protein levels of proteases like furin that facilitate the cleaving of the spike protein for virus entry were also found to be overexpressed in DM patients [56] . In order to understand the association between ACE2 expression in DM patients and COVID-19 infection, we must understand the mechanism of ACE2 action. ACE2 catalyses the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 and angiotensin 1-9 (Fig. 2) . These act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory enzymes and are found to be protective against lung ARDs [57] . After SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2, the virus degrades it, and thus the free angiotensin II induces acute lung injury [58] . Additionally, increased loss of potassium levels through urine and increased secretion of aldosterone also result after the intrusion of the virus [35] . Thus, ACE2 is unable to protect against lung injury after the entry of SARS-CoV-2 because ACE2 is degraded by the virus. The aetiology is still confusing, but it is clear that DM patients are at higher risk for severe complications with COVID-19. Thus, we have an urgent need for research studies focused on determining how hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycaemic conditions affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and how DM might affect vaccine efficacy.",

The process includes purifying the plasma that contains antibodies from a recovered COVID-19 patient. The next step is targeting these antibodies to the spike protein of the virus to neutralize it and likely to develop passive immunity against disease [68] . Moreover, structural and sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 with the other lethal CoV viruses such as SARS and MERS would help determine the best epitope to use in the design of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. This would essentially neutralize the viral S protein, although creating a vaccine is a slow process. The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins are 76.5% homologous at the amino acid level [5] . Recently, Wan et al. [69] also determined that SARS-CoV with residue 479 (lysine) and SARS-CoV-2 with glutamine 394 residue recognize and bind to lysine 31 of the ACE2 receptor in humans [70] . An alternate approach is to inject neutralizing antibodies into COVID-19-infected animals to obtain purified polyclonal antibodies from these animals [71] .

Increased ACE activity and reduced ACE2 activity promote lung injury. Furthermore, there have been several reports that ACE inhibitors (ACEI) inhibit the expression of ACE2 in kidney and heart [50] . As determined histologically, ACE2 is primarily membrane-bound but is also present as a soluble form in body fluids at a very low level [75, 76] .

[85] determined that the serum levels of angiotensin II are increased in COVID-19 patients who had pneumonia and lung injury. This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the balance of the ratio of ACE/ACE2, resulting in increased levels of angiotensin II. This further induces inflammation, pulmonary vasoconstriction and oxidative organ damage, causing acute lung injury. Thus, the modulation of RAS by ARBs or recombinant ACE2 increases the amount of ACE2 receptors and controls the levels of angiotensin II [86] . Moreover, this also increases the level of soluble ACE2 that competitively binds with SARS-CoV-2, causing delayed entry of the virus into cells and protecting against lung injury.",

If the viral polymerase could be selectively targeted or blocked, the virus could no longer produce RNA copies and the viral infection could be stopped. For instance, remdesivir is a drug developed against the Ebola virus specifically, but it showed promising results when used to treat MERS-CoV infection [63] . Remdesivir, conceals the viral RNA polymerase and prevents the proofreading to occur via the viral exonucleases. This way it decreases the viral RNA production in the host cells (Fig. 1) . Remdesivir was also suggested to give positive results when used against SARS-CoV-2, and a clinical trial sponsored by the NIH began in February 2020. However, the clinical impact of this drug against COVID-19 is still unclear and researchers are waiting for the outcome of the patient's ongoing clinical trials. Targeting viral processing is another possible treatment strategy, which takes advantage of the fact that viral proteases have a specific site where protein cutting occurs [89] . Therefore, drugs that fit into this specific site can block the functionality of a viral protease, thereby inhibiting viral protein production. Viral proteases are promising therapeutic targets since they are available in limited numbers in the host cells and have a specific site for catalytic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f activity [89] . This type of therapy has been successfully used against HIV, and now researchers are seeking to use protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.",

It was notably reported that chloroquine inhibits the replication of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-1. It was also found to prevent the entry of virus by inhibiting the glycosylation of ACE2 receptors, block proteases and regulate acidification in the endosome (Fig. 1) . Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine also promote an immunomodulatory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f effect via the production of cytokines and suppress autophagy and lysosomal functionality in host cells [90, 93] . Chloroquine was identified to suppress SARS-CoV-2 growth in vitro, showing more than a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) with a low micromolar range [94] . There are no adverse side effects known for the proposed usage of chloroquine against COVID-19 [95] . There was a sharp increase in the prescription of these drugs for COVID-19 patients with the reference of USA President Mr Donald Trump in late March in the US (https://www.bbc.com/news/51980731). Furthermore, it was also granted by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine drug as an emergency as authorized for COVID-19 therapy. There are more than 20 clinical trials carried in the US, UK, China and Spain on these drugs. The later reports from the clinical trials also suggested that chloroquine drug would minimise the disease duration [95] . Bur, later on, April 24, the FDA also licenced the usage of the drug issued under the warning regarding the dangerous threat for the serious heart rhythm adverse side effects in COVID-19 patients when used. However, to get a complete clearance of virus, chloroquine is combined with other drugs. For instance, hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin resulted in greater clearance of virus than hydroxychloroquine alone [96] .",
