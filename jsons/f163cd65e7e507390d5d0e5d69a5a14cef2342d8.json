During recent years, extensive research has been focused on developing computationally efficient and accurate models that can find novel noncoding RNAs and reveal their associated biological functionalities. Functionalities of noncoding RNAs are, to a large extent, determined by the secondary structures they fold into. Secondary structures are formed by bonded base pairs between nucleotides and may remain unchanged over evolution while the nucleotides of a sequence have been significantly modified through mutations. Profiling models based solely on sequence content such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [9] may miss important homologies when directly used to search genomes for noncoding RNAs containing complex secondary structures. Therefore, models that can profile noncoding RNAs must include both the content and structural information from the homologous sequences. The Covariance Model (CM) developed by Eddy and Durbin [5] extends the profiling HMM by allowing the coemission of pairing nucleotides on certain states to model base pairs, and introduces bifurcation states to emit parallel stems in the conformation. The CM is capable of modeling secondary structures comprised of nested and parallel stems. However, pseudoknot structures, where at least two structurally interleaving stems are involved, cannot be directly modeled with the CM and remained computationally intractable for searching [1] [10] [13] [14] [15] . So far, only a few systems have been developed for profiling and searching for RNA pseudoknots. One example of related work includes ERPIN, developed by Gautheret and Lambert [6] [11] . ERPIN searches genomes by sequentially looking for single stem loop motifs contained in the noncoding RNA gene. Since ERPIN does not allow the presence of gaps when it performs alignments, it is computationally very efficient. However, alignments with no gaps may miss distant homologies and thus result in a lower sensitivity. Another example is from Brown and Wilson [2] . They proposed a more realistic model comprised of a number of Stochastic Context Free Grammar (SCFG) [5] [16] components to profile pseudoknot structures. In their model, different components are used to derive the interleaving stems in a pseudoknot structure. The optimal alignment score of a sequence segment is computed by aligning it to all the components iteratively. The model can be used to search sequences with simple pseudoknot structures efficiently. However, for pseudoknots with more complex structure, more than two SCFG components may be needed and the extension of the iterative alignment algorithm on k components may need to perform k! different alignments in total since all components are treated equally in their model.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 715, "end": 718, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1042, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1521, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1531, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1541, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1719, "end": 1722, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1727, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2099, "end": 2102, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2209, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2214, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this paper, we propose a new method to search for RNA pseudoknot structures using a model of multiple CMs. Unlike the model of Brown and Wilson, independent CM components are used to profile the interleaving stems in a pseudoknot. Based on the model, we have developed a generic framework for modeling interleaving stems of pseudoknot structures; we propose an algorithm that can efficiently assign stems to components such that interleaving stems are profiled in different components. The components with more stems are associated with higher weights in determining the overall conformation of a sequence segment. In order to efficiently perform alignments of the sequence segment to the model, our searching algorithm aligns it to each component independently following the descending order of component weights. The statistical log-odds scores are computed based on the structural alignment scores on each CM component. Due to the conformational constraints inherently imposed by the CM components, stem contentions occur infrequently (less than 30%) and can be effectively resolved based on the conformational constraints from the alignment results on components with higher weight values. The algorithm is able to accomplish the search with a worst case time complexity of O((k \u2212 1)W 3 L) and a space complexity of O(kW 2 ), where k is the number of CM components in the model, W and L are the size of the searching window and the length of the genome respectively. We used the model to search for a variety of RNA pseudoknots inserted in randomly generated sequences. Experiments show that the model can achieve excellent sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) on almost all of them, while using only slightly more computation time than searching for pseudoknot-free RNA structures. We then applied the model and the searching algorithm to identify the pseudoknots on the 3' untranslated region in several RNA genomes from the corona virus family. An exact match between the locations found by our program and the real locations is observed. Finally, in order to test the ability of our program to cope with noncoding RNA genes with complex pseudoknot structures, two DNA genomes of bacterias were searched to find the location of the tmRNA genes. The results show that our program identified the locations with a small amount of error (with a right shift of around 20 nucleotide bases). To the best of our knowledge, these are the first experiments where a whole genome of more than a million nucleotides is successfully searched for a complex structure that contains pseudoknots.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "To test the performance of the model, we developed a searching program in C language and carried out searching experiments on a Sun/Solaris workstation.

In order to test whether the model is sensitive to the base composition of the background sequence, we varied the C+G concentration in the random background. The program computes the log-odds, the logarithmic ratio of the probability of generating sequence segment s by the null (random) model R to that by our model M . It reports a hit when the Z-score of s is greater than 4.0.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experiments and Results"}, {"text": "The program correctly identifies more than 80% of inserted sequence segments with excellent specificity in most of the experiments. The only exception is the srpRNA, where the program misses more than 50% inserted sequence segments in one of the experiments. The relatively lower sensitivity in that particular experiment can be partly ascribed to the fact that the pseudoknot structure of srpRNA contains fewer nucleotides; thus, its structural and sequence patterns have larger probability to occur randomly. The running time for srpRNA, however, is also significantly shorter than that needed by most of other RNA pseudoknots due to the smaller size of the model. Additionally, while alpha\u2212RBS pseudoknot has a more complex structure and three CM components are needed to model it, our searching algorithm efficiently identifies more than 95% of the inserted pseudoknots with high specificities. Our results demonstrate that higher C+G concentration in the background does not adversely affect the specificity of the model. The program achieves better overall performance in both sensitivity and specificity on the background of higher C+G concentrations. We therefore conjecture that the specificity of the model is partly determined by the base composition of the genome and can be improved if the base composition of the target gene is considerably different from its background.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experiments and Results"}, {"text": "To test the accuracy of the program on real genomes, we performed experiments to search for particular pseudoknot structures in the genomes for a variety of organisms.

This pseudoknot was recently shown to be essential for the replication of the viruses in the family [7] . In addition, we performed an experiment where the genomes of bacterias, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis MC58, were searched for their tmRNA genes. The Haemophilus influenzae DNA genome contains about 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 nucleotides and Neisseria meningitidis MC58 DNA genome contains about 2.2 \u00d7 10 6 nucleotides. The tmRNA functions importantly in the trans-translation process to add a C-terminal peptide tag to the incomplete protein product of a broken mRNA [12] . The central part of the secondary structure of tmRNA molecule consists of four pseudoknot structures. Figure 1 shows the pseudoknot structures on the tmRNA gene. In order to search the DNA genomes efficiently, the combined pseudoknots 1 and 2 were used to search the genome first and the program searches for the whole tmRNA gene only in the region around the locations where a hit for Pk1 and Pk2 is detected. We cut the genome into segments with shorter lengths (around 10 5 nucleotide bases for each), and run the program in parallel on ten of them in two rounds. The result for Neisseria meningitidis MC58 shows that we successfully identified the exact locations of tmRNA. However, the locations of tmRNA obtained for Haemophilus influenzae have a shift of around 20 nucleotides with respect to its real location. This error can probably be ascribed to our \"hit-and-extend\" searching strategy to resolve the difficulty arising from the complex structure and the relatively much larger size of tmRNA genes; positional errors may occur during different searching stages and accumulate to a significant value. Our experiment on the DNA genomes also demonstrates that, for each genome, it is very likely there is only one tmRNA gene in it, since our program found only one significant hit.

In our model, stem contention may occur such that two or more base pairs obtained from different components require the participation of the same nucleotide. We break the contention by introducing different priorities to components; base pairs determined from components with the highest priority win the contention.

Based on the consensus structure of the RNA sequence, an undirected graph G = (V, E) can be constructed where V , the set of vertices in G, consists of all stems on the sequence. Two vertices are connected with an edge in G if the corresponding stems are in parallel or nested. The set of vertices V needs to be partitioned into subsets such that the subgraph induced by each subset forms a clique. We use a greedy algorithm to perform the partition. Starting with a vertex set S initialized to contain a arbitrarily selected vertex, the algorithm iteratively searches the neighbors of the vertices in S and computes the set of vertices that are connected to all vertices in S. It then randomly selects one vertex v that is not in S from the set and modifies S by assigning v to S. The algorithm outputs S as one of the subsets in the partition when S can not be enlarged and randomly selects an unassigned vertex and repeats the same procedure.

Similar to the emission probabilities in HMMs, the emission probabilities in the CM for both unpaired nucleotides and base pairs are position dependent. The profiling of a stem hence consists of a chain of consecutive emissions of base pairs. Parallel stems on the RNA sequence are modeled with bifurcation transitions where a bifurcation state is split into two states.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "The genome of Haemophilus searched in our experiment is the reversed complementary DNA strand", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>GA </td><td>Organism </td><td>ncRNA </td><td>RL </td><td>SL </td><td>RT(hr) </td><td>GL(bs)\n</td></tr><tr><td>NC000907 </td><td>Haemophilus </td><td>tmRNA </td><td>472210 \u2212 </td><td>472575 </td><td>472177 \u2212 </td><td>472542 </td><td>170.00 1.83 </td><td>\u00d7 106\n</td></tr><tr><td>NC003112 </td><td>Neisseria meningitidis </td><td>tmRNA </td><td>1241197\u2212 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>1241197\u2212 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>170.00 </td><td>2.2 \u00d7 106\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>1241559 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>1241559\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>NC003045 </td><td>Bovine </td><td>3'UTR </td><td>30798 \u2212 </td><td>30859 </td><td>30798 \u2212 </td><td>30859 </td><td>1.24 </td><td>31028\n</td></tr><tr><td>CoronaVirus </td><td>pk\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>NC002645 </td><td>Human CoronaVirus </td><td>3'UTR pk\n</td><td>27063 \u2212 </td><td>27125 </td><td>27063 \u2212 </td><td>27125 </td><td>1.12 </td><td>27317\n</td></tr><tr><td>NC001846 </td><td>Murine </td><td>3'UTR </td><td>31092 \u2212 </td><td>31153 </td><td>31092 \u2212 </td><td>31153 </td><td>1.27 </td><td>31357\n</td></tr><tr><td>HepatitusVirus </td><td>pk\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>NC003436 </td><td>Porcine </td><td>3'UTR </td><td>27820 \u2212 </td><td>27882 </td><td>27820 \u2212 </td><td>27882 </td><td>1.17 </td><td>28033\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>DiarrheaVirus </td><td>pk\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": []}
