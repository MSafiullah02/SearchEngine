            "text": "Background: An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 and triggered a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). We aimed to find risk factors for the progression of COVID-19 to help reducing the risk of critical illness and death for clinical help. Methods: The data of COVID-19 patients until March 20, 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of critical/mortal and non-critical COVID-19 patients with meta-analysis. Results: Thirteen studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 3027 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male, older than 65, and smoking were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (male: OR = 1.76, 95% CI (1.41, 2.18), P < 0.00001; age over 65 years old: OR =6.06, 95% CI(3.98, 9.22), P < 0.00001; current smoking: OR =2.51, 95% CI(1.39, 3.32), P = 0.0006). The proportion of underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease were statistically significant higher in critical/mortal patients compared to the non-critical patients (diabetes: OR=3.68, 95% CI (2.68, 5.03), P < 0.00001; hypertension: OR = 2.72, 95% CI (1.60,4.64), P = 0.0002; cardiovascular disease: OR = 5.19, 95% CI(3.25, 8.29), P < 0.00001; respiratory disease: OR = 5.15, 95% CI(2.51, 10.57), P < 0.00001). Clinical manifestations such as fever, shortness of breath or dyspnea were associated with the progression of disease [fever: 0R = 0.56, 95% CI (0.38, 0.82), P = 0.003;shortness of breath or dyspnea: 0R=4.16, 95% CI (3.13, 5.53), P < 0.00001]. Laboratory examination such as aspartate amino transferase(AST) > 40U/L, creatinine(Cr) \u2265 133mol/L, hypersensitive cardiac troponin I(hs-cTnI) > 28pg/mL, procalcitonin(PCT) > 0.5ng/mL, lactatede hydrogenase(LDH) > 245U/L, and D-dimer \uff1e 0.5mg/L predicted the deterioration of disease while white blood cells(WBC)\uff1c4x10 9 /L meant a better clinical status[AST > 40U/L:OR=4.00, 95% CI (2.46, 6.52), P < 0.00001; Cr \u2265 133\u03bcmol/L: OR = 5.30, 95% CI (2.19, 12.83), P = 0.0002; hs-cTnI > 28 pg/mL: OR = 43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001; PCT > 0.5 ng/mL: OR = 43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001;LDH \uff1e 245U/L: OR = 43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001; D-dimer > 0.5mg/L: OR = 43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P \uff1c 0.00001; WBC < 4X10 9 /L: OR = 0.30, 95% CI (0.17, 0.51), P < 0.00001]. Conclusion: Male, aged over 65, smoking patients might face a greater risk of developing into the critical or mortal condition and the comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases could also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. Clinical manifestation such as fever, shortness of breath or dyspnea and laboratory examination such as WBC, AST, Cr, PCT, LDH, hs-cTnI and D-dimer could imply the progression of COVID-19.",

The rapidly increasing of patients, especially the critical or mortal patients, brought a big challenge to the public health. Lai [3] et al. found that mortality was correlated with country health care resources. However, in many countries, the invasive ventilator and intensive care unit (ICU) were far from adequate for the treatment of critical patients.",

And the SARS-CoV-2, which isolated from the lower respiratory tract of pneumonia patients with unknown causes in Wuhan, is identified as the seventh human coronaviruses [19] . SARS-CoV-2 attacks the alveolar epithelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is the ACE of isozyme, mainly distributed in cardiovascular, kidneys, testes, lung and colon, and other organizations [20] . The main role of ACE2 is to incise Ang II to generate Ang 1-7, which mediates the protective effects of vasodilation, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferation, to antagonize Ang II-induced vascular smooth muscle contraction, cell proliferation, fibrosis promotion and vascular inflammation [21] [22] [23] . When SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor on the surface of alveolar epithelial cells, The expression of ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells is down-regulated by mechanisms such as internalization, shedding and viral replication [24] . Then the increased concentration of Ang II leads to inflammatory response, and exudation of neutrophils, macrophages and fibrinous, resulting in loss of pulmonary ventilation function and difficulty in maintaining oxygenation [25] . At the same time, viral infection will cause the imbalance of T helper-1 and T helper-2 responses, and induce an inflammatory storm by increasing the levels of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-4, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6 [26] . Inflammatory storm in critical patients releases cytokines, causing systemic immune injury, which may be an important cause of multiple organ failure and even death [27] .",

It will increase the risk of thrombosis and more likely to cause ischemia and hypoxia due to the embolization of the viscera, which leads to the progression of the disease to critical disease or death. When the D-dimer > 0.5mg/L, it indicates the hypercoagulability of blood and suggests the deterioration of patients. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury by direct and/or indirect action. The direct injury is to infect cardiomyocytes by identifying ACE2 receptor, while the indirect injury may be caused by inflammatory storm inducing by immune response and/or oxygen supply imbalance inducing by acute respiratory distress syndrome.",
