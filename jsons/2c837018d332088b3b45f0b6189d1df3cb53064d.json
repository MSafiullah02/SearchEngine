            "text": "On December 31st 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology detected in Wuhan City (Hubei Province, China), possibly associated with exposures in a seafood wholesale market in the same city 2 . The cause of the syndrome was a new type of coronavirus isolated on January 7th 2020 and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious among humans and is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019, hereinafter referred to as COVID-19 Gorbalenya (2020) . Borrowing cyber security terminology, COVID-19 is a zero-day attack where the target system is the human immune system and the attacker is SARS-CoV-2. The human immune system has no specific defense against SARS-CoV-2. Being SARS-CoV-2 a new type of virus, there is no immunity provided by either natural or artificial immunity (i.e. antibodies or vaccines) humans can rely on. In the last three months, since the virus was first identified as a novel coronavirus in January 2020, an ever increasing number of scientific works have appeared in literature. Identifying relevant research outcomes at very early stages is utmost important for guiding the scientific community and governments in more effective research and decisions, respectively. However, traditional methods for measuring the relevance and impact of research outcomes (e.g. citation count, impact factor, etc.) might be ineffective due to the extremely narrow observation window currently available. Notoriously, indicators like citation count or impact factor require broader observation windows (i.e. few years) to be reliable Lehmann et al. (2008) . Altmetrics might be valid tools for measuring the impact in quasi-zero-day time-window. Altmetrics 3 have been introduced by Priem et al. (2012) as the study and use of scholarly impact measures based on activity in online tools and environments. The term has also been used to describe the metrics themselves. COVID-19 pandemic offers an extraordinary playground for understanding inherent correlation between impact and altmetrics. In fact, for the first time in human history, we are facing a pandemic, which is described, debated, and investigated in real time by the scientific community via conventional research venues (i.e. journal papers), jointly with social and on-line media.",

            "text": "Correlation among indicators. Much research focuses on finding a correlation between altmetrics and traditional indicators. The rationale behind these works is based on the assumption that traditional indicators have been extensively used for scoring research works, and measuring their impact. Hence, their reliability is accepted by practice. Works such as ; ; Bar-Ilan (2012) ; Thelwall et al. (2013) ; Sud and Thelwall (2014) ; follow this research line. These studies record moderate agreement (i.e. \u223c0.6 with Spearman correlation coefficient) with specific sources of altmetrics, i.e. Mendeley and Twitter. According to Thelwall (2018) and , Mendeley is the on-line platform that provides an indicator (i,e. the number of Mendeley readers) that correlates well with citation counts after a time period consisting of few years. The meta-analyisis conducted by Bornmann (2015) confirms this result, i.e. the correlation with traditional citations for micro-blogging is negligible, for blog counts it is small, and for bookmark counts from online reference managers, it is medium to large. Nevertheless, none of those studies take into account the key property of altmetrics, i.e. that they emerge quickly Peters et al. (2014) . Hence, altmetrics should be used for measuring impact at very early stages, as soon as a topic emerges or a set of research works appear in literature. As a consequence, we use a tight time scale (i.e. quasi-zero-day time-window) for carrying out our analysis.",

(2017) ; Bornmann and Haunschild (2018) ; . More in detail, Wouters et al. (2015) uses the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2016, i.e. the reference system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education institutions, for mining possible correlation among different metrics. The analysis is based on different metrics (either traditional or alternative) and research areas, and its outcomes converge towards limited or no correlation. Ravenscroft et al. (2017) finds very low or negative correlation coefficients between altmetrics provided by Altmetric.com and REF scores concerning societal impact published by British universities in use case studies. The aim of the analysis carried out by Bornmann and Haunschild (2018) is twofold. Bornmann and Haunschild (2018) investigates the correlation between citation counts and the relationship between the dimensions and quality of papers using regression analysis on post-publication peer-review system of F1000Prime assessments. Such a regression analysis shows that only Mendeley readers and citation counts are significantly related to quality. Finally, uses data from the Italian National Scientific Qualification (NSQ). The results show good correlation between Mendeley readers and citation count, and moderate accuracy for the automatic prediction of the candidates qualification at the NSQ by using independent settings of indicators as features for training a N\u00e4ive Bayes algorithm.",

We use Scopus as it is used by many organisations as the reference service for assessing the impact of research from a quantitative perspective (e.g. citation count, hindex, and impact factor). For example, the Italian National Scientific Habilitation 7 (ASN) uses Scopus for defining threshold values about the number of citations and h-index scores that candidates to permanent positions of Full and Associate Professor in Italian universities should exceed. The altmetrics gathering activity is based on Plum Analytics 8 (PlumX), which is accessed through its integration in the Scopus API 9 . We use PlumX among the variety of altmetrics 6 https://dev.elsevier.com/tecdoc_cited_by_in_scopus.html 7 https://www.anvur.it/en/activities/asn/ 8 https://plumanalytics.com/learn/about-metrics/ 9 https://dev.elsevier.com/documentation/PlumXMetricsAPI.wadl providers (e.g. Altmetric.com or ImpactStory) as, according to Peters et al. (2014) , it is the service that registers the most metrics for the most platforms. Additionally, in our previous study , we found that PlumX is currently the service that covers the highest number of research work (\u223c52.6M 10 ) if compared to Altmetric.com (\u223c5M 11 ) and ImpactStory (\u223c1M 12 ). PlumX provides three different levels of analytics consisting of (i) the category, which provides a global view across different indicators that are similar in semantics (e.g. the number alternative citations of a research work on social media); (ii) the metric, which identifies the indicator (e.g. the number of tweets about a research work); (iii) and the source, that basically allows to track the provenance of an indicator (e.g. the number of tweets on Twitter about a research work). Hereinafter we refer to these levels as the category-metric-source hierarchy. Table 1 summarises the categories provided by PlumX by suggesting an explanation for each of them. A more detailed explanation about the categories, metric, and sources as provided by PlumX is available on-line 13 . ",

This condition is useful to understand what are possible dense areas for each indicator. The density is computed with the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Scott (2015) by using Gaussian kernels. We use the method introduced by Silverman (1986) to compute the estimator bandwidth. We remark that the bandwidth is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. We opt for Silverman (1986) as it is one of the most used methods at the state of the art for automatic bandwidth estimation. The KDE is performed first by using absolute values (i.e. the values we record by gathering citation count and altmetrics) as sample set. Then, it is performed by using standardised values as sample set. The former is meant to get the probability distribution for each indicator separately. However, each indicator provides values recorded on very different ranges (cf. Table 2 ). Hence, KDE resulting from those different indicators are not directly comparable. Accordingly, we standardise indicator values and we then perform KDE over them. Again, KDE is performed for each indicator and for each level of the category-metric-source hierarchy. Standardised values are obtained by computing z-scores as the ratio between the sample mean and the standard deviation. Equation 1 formalises the formula we use for computing z-scores.",

            "text": "Correlation analysis. The correlation analysis aims at identifying similarities among different indicators both in their semantics and intended use on web platforms or social media (e.g. Twitter, Mendeley, etc.). This analysis repeats the experiment we carried out in . We remind that in Nuzzolese et al. (2019) we used the papers extracted from the curricula of the candidates to the scientific habilitation process held in Italy for all possible disciplines as dataset. In the context of this work we narrow the experiment to a dataset with very peculiar boundaries in terms of (i) the topic (i.e. COVID-19) and (ii) the observation time-window (i.e. ranging from January 15th 2020 to February 24th 2020). As in , we use the sample Pearson correlation coefficient (i.e. r) as the measure to assess the linear correlation between pairs of sets of indicators. The Pearson correlation coefficient is widely used in literature. It records correlation in terms of a value ranging from +1 to -1, where, +1 indicates total positive linear correlation, 0 indicates no linear correlation, and -1 indicates total negative linear correlation. For computing r, we construct a vector for each paper. The elements of a vector are the indicator values associated with its corresponding paper. We fill elements with 0 if an indicator is not available for a certain paper. The latter condition is mandatory in order to have vectors of equal size. In fact, r is computed by means of pairwise comparisons among vectors. The sample Pearson correlation coefficient is first computed among categories and then on sources by following the category-metric-source hierarchy as provided by PlumX. Again, we do not take into account the level of metrics as it is mirrored by the level of sources with a one-to-one correspondence. Additionally, r is investigated futher only for those sources belonging to a category for which we record moderate correlation, i.e. r>0.6. That is, we do not further investigate r if there is limited or no correlation at category level. Figure 7 shows the confusion matrices resulting from the pairwise comparisons of the correlation coefficients. For categories (cf. Figure 7a ) the highest correlation coefficients are recorded between: (i) mentions and citations, with r=0.63, statistical significance p<0.01 (p-values are computed by using the Student's t-distribution), and standard error SE r =0.04; (ii) social media and citations, with r=0.69, p<0.01, and SE r =0.04; and (iii) social media and mentions, with r=0.81, p<0.01, and SE r =0.03. Figure 7b shows the confusion matrix for the sources associated with the social media and citations categories, i.e. Twitter and Facebook for social media and Scopus for citations. If we focus on cross-category sources only (i.e. we do not take into account moderate correlation coefficients recorded between sources associated with the same category) we record moderate correlation between Facebook and Scopus, with r=0.69, p<0.01, and SE r =0.04. Figure 7c shows the confusion matrix for the sources associated with the mentions and citations categories, i.e. News, Stack Exchange, and Wikipedia for mentions and Scopus for citations. The only cross-category sources associated with moderate correlation are News for mentions and Scopus for citations, with r=0.63, p<0.01, and SE r =0.04. Finally, Figure 7d shows the confusion matrix for the sources associated with the mentions and social media categories. In the latter we record r>0.6 for the following cross-category sources: (i) Facebook and News, with r=0.69, p<0.01, and SE r =0.04; (ii) Facebook and Blog, with r=0.62, p<0.01, and SE r =0.04; (iii) Twitter and News, with r=0.83, p<0.01, and SE r =0.03; and (iv) Twitter and Blog, with r=0.84, p<0.01, and SE r =0.03.",

Hence, we use each pair for positioning papers on a Cartesian plane. Then we use such a positioning for defining a selection criterion. The axes of the Cartesian plane are the two indicators part of a pair. The axes values are the z-scores computed for each indicator (cf. Equation 1). We perform this analysis for the pairs (citations, social media), (citations, mentions), and (social media, mentions). We select these pairs only as they correlate better than others according to the correlation analysis (cf. Section 4.1). Furthermore, in COVID-19-KG citations, social media, and mentions are available for the most papers (cf. Figure 4) . Figure 8 shows the results of this analysis. In order to draw a boundary around candidate impactful papers, we identify a threshold t for each category of indicators. We use the lower bound of the 95% quantiles, i.e. Q 95 , as t. The quantiles are obtained by dividing the indicator values available for a given category (e.g. social media) COVID-19-KG into subsets of equal sizes. The lower bounds of the 95% quantiles recorded are 0.27, 1.11, and 1.75 for citations, social media, and mentions, respectively. For example, the Q 95 for the citations category contains all that papers that count more than 0.27 citations each. We opt for 95% quantiles as they are selective. In fact, they allow us to gather the 5% papers in COVID-19-KG that record the highest value with respect to the selected indicator categories. When we use citations and social media categories (we refer this combination to as G c,s ) as the axis of the Cartesian plane we record 6 papers whose indicator values are in Q 95 of both categories (cf. Figure 8a) . Instead, when we use citations and mentions categories (i.e. G c,m ) as axis we record 5 papers whose indicator values are in Q 95 of both categories (cf. Figure 8b) . Finally, when we use social media and mentions categories (i.e. G s,m ) as axis we record 9 papers whose indicator values are in Q 95 of both categories (cf. Figure 7d) .",

Finally, we compute the 95% quantile on resulting CIS values. Again, the lower bound of the 95% quantile is used as threshold value (i.e. t) for identifying candidate impactuful papers.

The limited set of indicators is referred to as I and comprises the categories with highest correlation values. The lower bound of the 95% quantile for CIS values computed over I is 1.21. Such a lower bound for I is 2. Figure 9 shows computed CIS values and selected papers. More specifically, Figure 9a shows CIS values computed on the whole set of indicators.

However, if we analyse the density curves for individual metrics we observe clear patterns that characterise each indicator category uniquely. On one hand, we remark that, for the scope of this work, we investigate those patterns in order to understand how indicator categories behave by using the data coming from the COVID-19-KG. On the other hand, it is worth saying that patterns from KDE are specifically suitable for working in scenarios in which inference is required. For example, an algorithm might leverage learned patterns for implementing a classic binary classification task. This task might require to identify relevant papers from other samples with similar characteristics (e.g. similar time-window). A typical classification task might distinguish papers according to the relevant/not-relevant dichotomy. Accordingly, as future work, it would be interesting to associate KDE probability with impact categories, e.g. those emerging from the geometric space analysis or the CIS one. The KDE based on z-scores shows that density curves are mostly overlapped with each other, both at category and source level. Thus, we observe a similar citational behaviour once the indicator values are standardised as a shared pattern clearly emerges from their density curves. However, the KDE based on z-scores flattens differences that in terms of indicator values and their semantics, though implicit, are fairly evident. For example, social media counts range from 0 to 45,197 with 1,250.34 and 36.5 as mean and median, respectively, while citations ranges from 0 to 82 with 1.63 and 0 as mean and median, respectively (cf.

Indeed, CIS is a multi-dimensional selection tool which is customisable in terms of the indicators used for performing the analysis. It is fairly evident (cf. Table 3 ) that both CIS I and CIS I share most of the papers identified by applying the two-dimensional geometric space selection with citations and mentions used as axes (referred to as G c,m in Table 3 ). CIS I and CIS I extend the set of selected papers returned by G c,m with 4 additional papers (cf. 20 Andersen et al.

However, the paper reporting the theory of snakes being the intermediate hosts has been largely (i) retweeted, shared, and liked on different social networks, and (ii) discussed and reported by many international newspapers worldwide. Thus it contributed to the massive \"infodemic\" 21 about COVID-19, i.e. an over-abundance of information, either accurate or not, which makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it Zarocostas (2020) . This infodemic is captured by altmetrics that by definition are fed by on-line tools and platforms. As a matter of fact, the paper about the theory of snakes being the intermediate hosts is selected among the candidates only by G s,m , where both axes are altmetrics, and not by G c,s and G c,m , where traditional citations are taken into account. This suggests a twofold speculation: (i) the scientometric community should handle altmetrics very carefully as they may lead to unreliable and debatable results; (ii) altmetrics are promising tools not only for measuring impact, but also to make unwanted scanarios (e.g. infodemic) emerge from the knowledge soup of scientific literature.

            "text": "In this work we investigate altmetrics and citation count as tools for detecting impactful research works in quasizero-day time-windows, as it is for the case of COVID-19. COVID-19 offers an extraordinary real-world case-study for understanding inherent correlation among impact and altmetrics. As mentioned in Section 1, for the first time in history, humankind is facing a pandemic, which is described, debated, and investigated in real time by the scientific community via conventional research venues (i.e. journal papers), and social and on-line media. The latters are the natural playground of altmetrics. Our case-study relies on a sample of 212 scientific papers on COVID-19 collected by means of a literature review. Such a literature review is based on a two-stage screening process used to assess the relevance of studies on COVID-19 appeared in literature from January 15th 2020 to February 24th 2020. This sample is used for constructing a knowledge graph, i.e. COVID-19-KG, modelled in compliance with the Indicators Ontology (i.e. I-Ont). COVID-19-KG is the input of our analysis aimed at investigating (i) behavioural characteristics of altmetrics and citation count and (ii) possibible approaches for using altmetrics along with citation count for automatically identifying candidate impactful research works in COVID-19-KG. We find moderate correlation among traditional citation count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. This suggests there is a common intended meaning of the citational acts associated with these indicators. Additionally, we define the Comprehensive Impact Score (CIS) that harmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact indicator. CIS shows to be a promising tool for selecting relevant papers even in a tight observation window. Possible future work include the use of CIS as a feature for predicting the results of evaluation procedures of academics as presented in works like . Similarly, further investigation is needed to mine the rhetorical nature of citational acts associated with altmetrics. The latter is a mandatory step for building tools such as Ciancarini et al. (2014) and Peroni et al. (2020) . More ambitiously, future research focused on altmetrics and citations should go in the direction envisioned by Gil et al. (2014) and Kitano (2016) , thus contributing to a new family of artificial intelligence aimed at achieving autonomous discovery science.",

As a matter of fact, the limited time-window is a mandatory requirement inherently related to the limited scientific literature we have since COVID-19 first appeared in human history (approximately December 2019). Based on our results we are happy to record social media (i.e. Twitter and Facebook) and mentions (limited to News and Blogs only) as valid tools for fast and early scholarly communication. This follows the visionary intuition of the altmetrics manifesto 18 byPriem et al. (2012). The moderate occurrence of traditional citation counts with a certain positive (i.e. r > 0.6) and statistically significant (i.e. p < 0.01) correlation with altmetrics (i.e. social media and mentions) is, instead, a bit surprising. The statistics about usage (cf.Table 2), along with the results recorded for the KDE and the correlation analysis entitle us to claim that tweets on Twitter, shares and likes on Facebook, mentions on news and blogs, and citations in academic literature tracked by Scopus, are the channels that have been mostly used for early scholarly communication about COVID-19, i.e. this addresses RQ1.",
