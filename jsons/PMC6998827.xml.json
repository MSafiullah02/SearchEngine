            "text": "As the birth rate declines and life expectancy rises, population aging is occurring throughout the world, which is the main driver of the dementia epidemic [1]. It is estimated by the World Alzheimer Report 2018 [2, 3] that there will be a dramatic increase in the number of people living with dementia in the coming decades, from 50 million in 2018 to 152 million by 2050, with a particularly sharp increase in low- and middle-income countries. In 2017, the number of people aged 65 and over in China was 158 million, accounting for 11.4% of the total population [4]. Among them, 4.6% were estimated to have dementia [5]. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), refers to an intermediate clinical state between normal cognitive aging and dementia [6]. A meta-analysis indicates that the annual conversion rate from MCI to dementia is approximately 20% in community settings and over 30% in memory clinics [7]. It is also noteworthy that depression is often concomitant with cognitive deficits. Population-based studies have found that late-life depression (depression that occurs at the age 60 and above) and its symptoms are associated with cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia [8].",

The prevalence increases with age, ranging from 35 to 80% for people aged 80\u2013105 [10]. This means China is currently faced with the challenge of having to cope with an increasing proportion of its older adults with dementia and MCI. Moreover, there has been an emerging trend of older adults moving from communities to residential care homes for care. The older adults living in residential care homes (RCHs) are generally the middle-old (aged 75\u201384) and the oldest-old (aged\u226585). Age as an intrinsic factor places them at a high risk for cognitive decline, ensuing a high risk of dementia [11, 12], resulting in a higher prevalence of MCI in RCHs than in communities [13].",

A study in the UK has revealed that use of mobile devices by older adults can support mental health, promote self-reliance, prevent loneliness, and improve mood [14]. A study in Singapore [15] suggested that compared to those who never or rarely used mobile phones, more frequent (occasional or daily) use of mobile phones was associated with lower rates and risk of decline in global cognitive, attention and working memory, and memory functioning. Barbosa\u2019s study [16] concluded that 3-month use of a communication app on a tablet could enhance social connectedness as well as sense of well-being and confidence with technology among older adults in residential care.

Parametric statistical tests were performed for normally distributed data and non-parametric tests for abnormally distributed data. After testing the assumptions for multivariate regression such as presence of linearity between the independent variables and the dependent variable and the absence of multicollinearity between the independent variables, a multivariate linear regression model was used to control for confounding factors such as age, sex, BMI, level of education, monthly income, frequency of socialization and underlying diseases. Mobile device use, age, sex, BMI, level of education, monthly income, frequency of socialization and type of underlying disease were used as the independent variables, and the total MoCA score and the sub-scores of each dimension as dependent variables respectively to analyze the impact of mobile device use on cognitive function. A binary logistic regression model was used to examine the impact of mobile device use on the level of depressive symptoms while adjusting for the confounding factors age, sex, BMI, level of education, monthly income, frequency of socialization and type of underlying disease. In the model, absence of depressive symptoms (GDS-15 score < 5) was assigned the value of \u201c0\u201d while presence of depressive symptoms was assigned the value of \u201c1\u201d (GDS-15 score \u2265 5). P < 0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference.",

Social interaction is considered as one of the lifestyle factors that play a significant role in maintaining or improving cognitive functioning in older adults. A growing body of literature has described positive effects of social engagement and negative effects of social isolation on cognitive performance in older adults [24]. Previous research [25, 26] has shown that frail older adults living in retirement homes are especially vulnerable to social isolation and loneliness, which is related to decreased social networks, mobility, health status, and interaction with close ties. The most distinctive features of mobile devices are access to Internet, multimedia and multi-task processing. In our study, the mobile devices users living in RCHs used the device for communication with social ties (family members, friends, staff in the RCH, etc.), entertainment (listening to music, watching videos, playing games, etc.) and information search (keeping up with current events and latest news, looking up recipes and health information online, etc.). Studies suggest that digital communication technologies embedded in mobile devices can contribute to social connectedness (meaningful social interaction) and help tackle feelings of loneliness and factors leading to social isolation in later life [27, 28]. Enhanced social connectedness may have contributed to the significantly higher cognitive scores of mobile device users in MoCA test and lower risks for geriatric depression in our study. The results of the logistic regression have revealed that the female residents in RCHs had a significantly lower risk for depressive symptoms, which might be due to that they were more socially engaged than male residents.",

These results indicate that, in spite of the changes in neurobiological functioning caused by aging, complex cognitively-engaging activities such as Internet searching may improve brain functions in older adults, thus enhancing their cognitive skills, especially executive functions. In addition, playing games on mobile devices has also been proven to have generalized positive effects on cognitive control abilities in older adults [30].

Studies have revealed that self-confidence, feelings of loneliness, social interaction, satisfaction with one\u2019s life, and depression can be improved when older adults learn how to use computers and gain access to Internet [33, 34]. Moreover, older adults are motivated to use digital technology to support their mental health through mechanisms of distraction (from unwanted thoughts and may help to concentrate the mind), normalization (reading online descriptions of symptoms of poor mental health are felt to be normalizing), and facilitated expression of mental states (helpful for exploring their own feelings and being able to express these) [14].

Secondly, the habit of mobile device use (i.e. for how long the older adults have been using the device, how often they use the device, how much time they spend using it each day, etc.) was not discussed in our study, which can be taken into consideration by future research. Thirdly, comorbidities that could affect cognitive functioning and mood, such as vitamin B12 and D depletions, hypothyroidism were not considered in our study. Fourthly, the diagnosis of MCI was based on the MoCA score. Therefore, multi-center studies with a larger sample size should be carried out in the future to further examine the effect of mobile device use on cognitive function and depression in residents of RCHs as well as the cognitive trajectory of mobile device users over time of usage and time of institutionalization. In future studies, the size of the resident\u2019s social network, the type of activities they perform throughout the day in RCHs and the type of activities performed with the mobile device and the frequency of using the device should also be taken into account.",
