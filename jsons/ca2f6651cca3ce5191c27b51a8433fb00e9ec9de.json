In turn, drug discovery efforts have focused on investigating mechanisms that have the potential for raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in plasma in the belief that there is an inverse relationship between HDL-C levels and the risk of coronary heart disease. Current therapies such as fibrates or niacin exert only a moderate effect on increasing HDL-C levels while displaying significant side effects.",

In this regard, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which is a 74-kDa plasma glycoprotein secreted by the liver, has been investigated. CETP facilitates the transfer of the cholesterol ester from HDL to LDL and VLDL in exchange for triglycerides and furthermore, CETP inhibition leads to increased HDL-C in humans. HDL particles can accept cholesterol from peripheral tissues such as macrophages, and thus CETP inhibitors could promote reverse cholesterol transport and therefore be anti-atherogenic.",

            "text": "Recently, there have been studies on the role of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK-1) in the cell cycle as a response to genotoxic stresses. These studies demonstrated that inhibition of CHK-1 offers a mechanism for sensitising various DNA-damaging therapies. Human CHK-1 is a serine/threonine kinase that is phosphorylated by the upstream kinases ATR and/or ATM following DNA damage. CHK-1 subsequently phosphorylates Cdc25A and induces its degradation. This results in inhibition of the downstream cyclin E/Cdk2 or cyclin B/Cdc2 kinases, leading to cell cycle arrest at the S phase or G2/M phase, respectively. As tumour cells can arrest at different cell cycle checkpoints mediated by CHK-1, they have a chance to repair themselves. Thus, inhibition of CHK-1 to remove S and G2/ M checkpoints will cause tumour cells to undergo premature mitotic entry, leading to cell death.",

            "text": "Tumour cells and normal cells differ in that tumour cells are often deficient in p53, preventing arrest at the G1 checkpoint, whereas, in response to DNA damage, normal cells are capable of arresting at G1 checkpoint through the p53-mediated pathway, ensuring genomic integrity. This difference provides the potential for a therapeutic window for sensitising DNA-damaging treatments of cancer using CHK-1 inhibitors. A recent publication reports the discovery of 1,4-dihydroindeno [1,2-c] pyrazoles as a new class of CHK-1 kinase inhibitors. 2 The program used the screening hit 8 as a starting point for further design. This compound possessed an IC 50 of 510 nM against CHK-1. An x-ray co-crystal structure of 8 bound to the CHK-1 active site indicated to the project team that they should focus their efforts on elucidating SAR around the fluoro group because it occupied a region where extra hydrogen bonding between the inhibitor and several polar residues of the backbone protein could be envisioned. A hit-to-lead process was then undertaken supported by x-ray crystallography. From these rounds of medicinal design, a number of potent compounds were obtained that possessed inhibitory properties against CHK-1. One of the most potent compounds was 9 which possessed an IC 50 value of 6.2 nM. Compounds active in the enzymatic inhibition assay, such as 9, were then tested in two cellular assays. A cell proliferation assay (MTS assay) in HeLa cells (a human cervical cancer cell line) was used to measure the ability of CHK-1 inhibitors to sensitise cells to the DNA-damaging agent, doxorubicin. An EC 50 was determined for the inhibitor as a single agent and the inhibitor in combination with doxorubicin; with the ratio being a relative scale of an inhibitor's ability to potentiate the DNA-damaging agent. Additionally, a cell cycle analysis (FACS assay) in H1299 cells (a human lung cancer cell line) was performed to determine if the mechanism of doxorubicin sensitisation is through abrogation of G2/M check-point. Here, the EC 50 was either the concentration of a CHK-1 inhibitor that reduces doxorubicin-induced G2/M cell population by half, or it was measured in the absence of doxorubicin. Compound 9 possessed an EC 50 of 1.8 lM in the MTS assay, and an EC 50 of 770 nM in the FACS assay (with doxorubicin present).",

Based on one of the hits from virtual screening, a small library of 15 analogues was synthesised producing four compounds that inhibited glutamine synthetase. 14 The related 3C and 3C-like proteinase (3C pro and 3CL pro ) of picornaviruses and coronaviruses, respectively, are good drug targets. As part of an effort to generate broad-spectrum inhibitors of these enzymes, a library of inhibitors based on a halopyridinyl ester was prepared. Three of the compounds inhibited the cleavage activity of HAV 3C pro with K ic s of 120-240 nM -among the most potent non-peptidic inhibitors reported to date against a 3C pro . 15 Vancomycin is mainly used as an antibacterial agent of last resort, but recently vancomycin-resistant bacterial strains have been emerging.

The lead compound prevented wild-type HIV-1 multiplication in MT-4 cell culture with an EC 50 value of 0.35 lM. To perform a structure-activity relationship study, 40 analogues of the lead compound were prepared by an unprecedented one-pot method of solution-phase parallel synthesis. 21 The cyclodepsipeptide Jaspamide is an interesting marine metabolite, that possesses a potent inhibitory activity against breast and prostate cancer, as a consequence of its ability to disrupt actin cytoskeleton dynamics. A recent report describes the synthetic modification of the natural metabolite, generating small arrays of unnatural variants. 22 ",
