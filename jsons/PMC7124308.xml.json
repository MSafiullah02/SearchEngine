            "text": "AstVs (family Astroviridae) are small-rounded viruses (SRVs) with a peculiar starlike shape when observed on electron microscopy (EM), although this conformation is not always readily recognizable. AstV genome is composed of a plus-sense single-stranded RNA of 6.4 of 7.3 kb in size, containing 3 open reading frames (ORFs) and with a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail.1 Two ORFs, located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome (ORF1a and ORF1b), encode nonstructural proteins, while ORF2, located at the 3\u2032 end, encodes the capsid protein.1 AstVs were first identified by EM in 1975 in Scotland in the stools of infants hospitalized with diarrhea.9 Subsequently, similar SRVs have been identified from several mammalian and avian species,10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 including bats,19 rats,20 and aquatic mammals.21 AstV infection is associated with gastroenteritis in most animal species, and human AstVs are regarded as the second or third most common cause of viral diarrhea in children.1 AstVs have also been associated with extraintestinal diseases, such as nephritis in chicken,2 hepatitis in ducks,16 and shaking syndrome in mink.3\n",

In this classification, 2 genogroups (GI and II) have been defined in Mamastrovirus genus. AstV strains within the same species display a p-distance lower than 0.312 and species are assigned consecutive letters. In this system, human AstVs type 1 to type 8 are GI.A, feline AstV is GI.B, and canine AstVs are GI.E.",

AstV-like particles were first detected on EM in beagle pups with diarrheal disease in the United States in 1980, in mixed infection with canine parvovirus type-2 (CPV2) and canine coronaviruses (CCoV).5 AstV-like particles were also detected on EM in 3 of 157 normal fecal samples (but not in 29 diarrheal samples) in a survey in Australia in 1984.27 In a large EM-based survey in Germany, SRVs were identified in 41 of 4044 (about 1%) feces of dogs with diarrhea.28 More recently, AstVs have been identified in dogs with enteric signs and characterized molecularly, suggesting that the detected viruses may represent a distinct AstV species.6, 7, 8\n",

The hypervariable region is believed to form the spikes of the virion and to interact with the cell receptors32 as neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been mapped to this variable domain.33, 34 These findings may be predictive of marked antigenic differences among the various canine strains.",

Clinical signs in the pup lasted 4 days, with viral shedding continuing for 8 days after the pup recovered from the disease. The pup tested negative to all other canine pathogens, suggesting that AstV was actually the causative agent of the disease.7 By quantification of viral load in real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), a positive correlation between the clinical signs and the virus titers was observed with the highest viral loads occurring during the acute symptomatic phase. Also, specific IgGs were not detected in the serum sample collected at the time of hospitalization, but they were detectable 2 weeks after hospitalization, indicating seroconversion.7 Interesting pieces of information have been gathered by monitoring an outbreak of gastroenteric disease associated with canine AstV, affecting 2 household dogs (aged 2 years and 2 months, respectively). The AstV strain, ITA/2010/Zoid, displayed limited amino acid identity (70.3% to 73.9%) to other canine AstV strains in the full-length capsid protein. Antibodies specific for the prototype canine astrovirus isolate ITA/2008/Bari were not detected in the convalescent sera of the animals, suggesting limited antigenic relatedness. In the 2 animals, virus shedding (up to 107 to 108 copies of genome equivalents/gr of feces) was correlated with clinical signs, with the disease being severer and virus shedding being more prolonged (more than 1 month) in the young pup (Martella and colleagues, unpublished information, 2011). Prolonged virus shedding after acute infection and resistance in the environments35, 36 could be factors facilitating virus diffusion in susceptible population.",

The low prevalence rates on EM, compared to the high rates revealed in molecular assays, suggest AstV titers in the feces are above the EM detection limits for a restricted time period.7 Also, EM is not always able to characterize firmly SRVs, as the peculiar morphology of AstVs is often lost during sample conservation and/or processing.9 Several primer sets have been developed to recognize effectively canine AstVs in RT-PCR (Table 1). The primers have been designed in highly conserved regions of the ORF1b (RdRp) and ORF2 (capsid protein). Also, a quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) has been set up (Table 1). The qRT-PCR assay was able to detect AstV strains that markedly differed in the capsid gene and proved to be highly sensitive (Martella and colleagues, unpublished data, 2011).
