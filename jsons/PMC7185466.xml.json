            "text": "As air passes through the nose, three distinct respiratory processes are taking place in the nasal cavities: air filtering, heating and humidifying. Altogether, these functions constitute the air conditioning within the upper respiratory airways [1]. In the vestibular region, these cavities are lined by a skin-like epithelium that gradually changes towards the nasal valves to the characteristic pseudo-stratified columnar ciliated lining termed the respiratory epithelium [2]. As part of the nose's functions, nasal epithelium (NE), along with mucous airway surface liquid (ASL), provides an important physico-chemical and immunological barrier against different factors targeting lower airways [2]. These defence mechanisms depend on mucociliary clearance, its regenerative capacity and ability to participate in immune responses by secreting pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, among others [3]. In fact, all respiratory passages, from the nose to the terminal bronchioles share these features reflecting their common susceptibility to various agents such as irritants/occupational sensitizers, allergens and microorganisms [2]. In both upper and lower airways, physiological responses to these agents include: narrowing of the lumen, mucous secretion and inflammation [1], [2]. Given the anatomical and physiological similarities, the concept of united airways is being increasingly discussed in clinical medicine leading to the notion that reactions in the upper airways (i.e., nose) influence or reflect complications in lower airways (i.e., lungs) [4], [5], [6], [7]. Therefore, NE cells, harvested by a non-invasive brushing procedure, have been used to assess upper and lower airway diseases [8], [9]. In this way, extensive characterization of NE proteome would allow better understanding of signaling pathways and networks driving the physiology or pathophysiology of the respiratory system. To the best of our knowledge, only three studies aimed to investigate human NE proteome have been published using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE), one by our own group to search proteins associated with cystic fibrosis disease [10], [11]. Min-Man et al. [12] investigated proteins associated with the pathogenesis of nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis while Lee et al. constructed a partial 2DE reference map of nasal mucosa proteins. However, 2DE-based proteomics deliver poor coverage of membrane proteins [13].",

Cell lysis was assisted by intermittent sonication cycles (10 \u00d7 10 in. pulse interleaved by 30 in.) on ice. The sample was clarified by centrifugation at 2000 \u00d7g for 3 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove cellular debris.

The 2D-LC-MS/MS experiments were conducted as previously described [15], [16]. The CID spectra were analyzed using SEQUEST\u2122 operating on a Beowulf 18-node parallel virtual machine cluster computer (ThermoElectron, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using a UniProt non-redundant human proteome database (http://www.expasy.org, 03/2008 release). Only peptides with conventional tryptic termini (allowing for up to two internal missed cleavages) possessing delta-correlation scores (\u0394Cn) > 0.1 and charge state-dependent cross correlation (Xcorr) criteria of > 2.1 for [M+H]1+, > 2.3 for [M+H]2+ and > 3.5 for [M+H]3+ were considered as legitimate identifications. A final list of the identified proteins with the corresponding number of unique peptides (UPCs; non-redundant) and total counts for those peptides (TPCs) observed in two consecutive runs was obtained. The obtained identifications are the sum of 70 and 80 SCX fractions for the soluble and membrane-enriched fractions, respectively, each analyzed in duplicate. Results were further analyzed using in-house developed software for determination of unique peptides and proteins, considering only positive identifications when at least 2 UPs per protein were assigned. To increase identification confidence, only proteins identified in three independent experiments were considered positively identified. The false discovery rate (FDR %) (peptide level) was calculated by searching the data against a decoy database and was estimated to be between 4.2% and 4.5%. To aid the biological interpretation of the extensive proteins' lists, proteins were categorized according to their Gene Ontology (GO) annotations using ProteinOn, a web tool focused on calculating GO-based protein semantic similarity [17], curated information deposited in Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (http://www.hprd.org, release 8, July 2009) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity\u00ae Systems, www.ingenuity.com). Putative transmembrane domains (TMD) and grand average hydropath value index (GRAVY) [18] were calculated by freely available tools (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM and http://www.geneinfinity.org/sms_proteingravy.html). Protein amount in the samples was estimated by exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) [19], an index that compares the number of parent ions per protein observed with the number of predicted peptides for each protein. For emPAI calculations, only predicted tryptic peptides with more than 5 amino acids (TP > 5aa) were considered for index calculation as smaller peptides are hardly identified by MS and fall out of the range of the MS analysis (> 300 m/z). Protein contents in molar percentages were calculated by emPAI normalization between experiments, as described by Ishihama et al. (2005).",

A large number of identified proteins are involved in ion, amino acid and lipid transportation. The identification of several ion channels is consistent with the role of the respiratory epithelium in controlling the ionic composition and fluid volume at the airways surface, which is critical for normal lung physiology [22], [23] (Fig. 5\n). Indeed, we have identified the electrogenic Na+/K+-ATPase subunits (ATP1A1, ATP1B1, ATP1B3) components of a pump located at basolateral membrane that drive the absorption of Na+ at the apical membrane through the epithelial sodium channel ENaC [24]. The transepithelial electrical potential difference generated by Na+ absorption also drives a transepithelial Cl\u2212 absorption to maintain the electroneutrality of the ion transport process. The Cl\u2212 ion must first enter the cell through the basolateral membrane by means of the Na+-K+-Cl\u2212 co-transporter (NKCC2), which was also identified in this study, being secreted at the apical membrane, for example, via the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The electrical driving force for Cl\u2212 secretion is also supplied by basolateral K+ channels [25]. Although we were able to show the presence of CFTR in human NE by immunocytochemistry [14], [26], [27] neither CFTR, ENaC nor basolateral K+ channels were identified in this study by two unique peptides identified in three independent runs. However, by lowering this threshold to one peptide, the CFTR was identified in four independent experiments by a total of five unique peptides. The high degree of hydrophobicity, extensive glycosylation of CFTR protein [28] and low expression in NE [29] may explain our inability to identify this protein using stringent identification thresholds. Similarly, important basolateral K+ channels such as KCNN1, KCNN4, KCNJ5, KCND1 and KCNAB1 were also identified using less stringent thresholds, suggesting the low abundance of these regulatory proteins. However, a subunit of the electrogenic H+/K+-ATPase (ATP12A) was identified using stringent criteria. This protein, along with Na+/K+-ATPase, is responsible for maintenance of osmotic balance and intracellular ionic composition. Absorption or secretion of water in NE is driven by osmosis and determined by transepithelial NaCl movement through the lipid layer via aquaporin family of proteins [30], [31]. Here, aquaporin 5 (AQP5) was identified as the only molecule involved in water movement across the nasal epithelium.",

They are located in the membranes of endo(sarco)plasmic reticulum, including the nuclear envelope (SERCA pump), the Golgi network (the SPCA pump) and plasma membrane (PMCA pump) [34]. Each pump is a product of a multigene family, the number of isoforms being further increased by alternative splicing of the primary transcripts. In this study, several components of those three Ca2+ pumps were identified: ATP2A1, ATP2A2 and ATP2A3 belonging to the SERCA pump, ATP2C1 belonging to the SPCA pump and ATP2B1, ATP2B4 belonging to the PMCA [34]. Components of V-type H+-ATPase were also identified, namely two subunits belonging to the membrane-embedded V0 complex (ATP6V0A4, ATP6V0C) and two subunits belonging to the citoplasmic V1 complex (ATP6AP1, ATP6V1E1) responsible for H+ translocation across the membrane and mediation of ATP hydrolysis. While known to be associated with the endosomal membrane, this pump was also found in plasma membranes where the proton pump energizes transport across cell membranes and entire epithelia [35]. The Cu2+-ATPase 7B (ATP7B), also observed in our data, is responsible for the delicate balance of Cu2+ in the cells and throughout the whole body in association with ATP7A. Its absence or malfunction is described in severe human genetic disorders, Menkes and Wilson diseases. ATP7B is primarily expressed in the liver but it was also observed at lower levels in brain, heart and lungs [36]. Combined data from various reports on polarized hepatic cells suggest a continuous recycling of ATP7B-containing vesicles between sub-apical compartment and the apical membrane for release of Cu2+ as its levels increased in the cell [36].",

In particular, ABCC1 (also known by MRP1, Multidrug Resistance Protein 1) is highly expressed mainly at the basolateral side of bronchial epithelial cells, namely ciliated and goblet cells. This is consistent with our data where a high number of unique peptides were detected for this protein (Table SD1). MRP1 confers resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents including vincristine, daunorubicin and methotrexate. Physiological substrates for MRP1 are e.g., leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and glutathione disulfide. Interestingly, these substrates play an important role in lung physiology with respect to inflammation and oxidative stress [37]. ABCC3 (or MRP3) gene is the closest MRP1 homologue. Its product is involved in resistance against the anti-cancer drugs etoposide, teniposide and at higher concentrations also to methotrexate. The physiological function is still unknown for ABCC4 (or MRP4). They may serve as an efflux pump of nucleosides cAMP and cGMP at low affinity, likely in a GSH-independent manner, having thus different substrate specificities. In summary, expression levels of these transporters at airway epithelium, in particular in NE, should be crucial for detoxification and might have implications in therapeutic strategies for respiratory diseases.",

These structures are located at plasma membrane and have an important function of establishing physical interactions between adjacent cells, maintaining integrity and impermeability of airway epithelia [49], [50]. In addition, a substantial number of proteins are involved in receptor activity which is compatible with the important role of epithelial cells in sensing changes in its environment [51]. This group includes proteins belonging to the small GTPase superfamily (RAB13, RAB21, RAP1A, RAC1), tyrosine protein kinase family (EGFR, IGF1R, ERBB2, EPHA2) and tyrosine protein phosphatase family (PTPRC, PTPRJ). Some molecules involved in immune response were also grouped here. This is the case of HLA-A, HLA-DRA proteins, constituents of the MHC classe I and II, respectively, the antigen binders IGHG1, IGKC, IGHM, and leukocyte surface markers such CD47, CD9, CD59, CD14. The latter marker was already described as cooperating with MD-2 and TLR4 to mediate the innate immune response to bacterial LPS [51], [52]. Other LPS binding proteins such as \u03b1-1 defensin, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein were also grouped here. Molecules involved in immune response can arise from several sources, including inflammatory cells resident in the epithelium. In accordance with current knowledge, its interaction with respiratory epithelia modulates innate and acquired immune response against microbial infections and inhaled toxic pollutants [3], [53].",

Glutathione is one of the most powerful endogenous antioxidants, protecting molecules by conjugating with hydrogen peroxide to yield water and oxygen via glutathione peroxidase (GPX1). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is then regenerated to GSH by NADPH via glutathione reductase (GSR). NFR-2 [Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2] is a transcription factor that regulates the antioxidant response [54], [55], [56] by inducing expression of genes involved in combating oxidative stress and activating the body's own protective response. Examples of these are glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), a family of cytosolic, mitochondrial and microsomal enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of GSH with both endogenous and xenobiotic electrophiles which members GSTA1, GSTK1, GSTO1 and GSTP1 were identified here, along with the glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), an enzyme involved in the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of GSH. GST and GCLC are induced by NFR-2 activation and represent an important route to eliminate potentially harmful and toxic compounds while balancing redox state of a cell [57], [58]. This result is in agreement with higher proportion of identified proteins involved in drug and xenobiotics metabolism (ALDH5A1, ALDH7A1, ALDH9A1, CAT, CES1, CES2, GCLC, GSTA1, GSTO1, GSTP1, HSP90AB1, NQO1, PPP2R1A). All these proteins are involved in the maintenance of an adequate oxidant/antioxidant balance in NE cells, playing a decisive role in ameliorating the oxidative stress and protect the airways against hostility and injury promoted by the environment. Accumulation of ROS with concomitant attack to cellular membranes might compromise cellular structure maintenance and tissue integrity, therefore combating oxidative stress is a critical and vital function in this tissue. A slight enrichment of DNA replication, recombination and repair functions in soluble fraction was also observed (Table SD4b), which in conjugation with oxidative stress response machinery, may orchestrate a particular proteinaceous environment propitious to cellular division in accordance with the rapid turnover and regeneration of NE.",

This interface is constantly being exposed to physical and chemical aggressions resulting in increased wound healing and remodeling[3], [53], [59], [60]. The epithelium, therefore, has increased demands of high energy compounds (ATP and NADH), reducing equivalents (NADPH) and pentoses, molecules derived from the highlighted processes, while maintaining a constant reservoir of glucose to guarantee proper physiological functions and assure tissue integrity and structure. Of particular interest is the generation of pentoses for the synthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids, used in genomic material processing, and NADPH, which functions in reductive biosynthesis (e.g. fatty acids synthesis) and cell protection from oxidative stress by glutathione reduction [61].",

This observation is illustrated by the identification of several subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, involved in energy production and ATP metabolism, and also structural ribosomal constituents, namely several members of the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome. Components of cytoskeleton such as keratins, among others, also belong to the top 100 most abundant proteins in nasal epithelium cells. We observed on both NE fractions type II (KRT1, KRT5, KRT7, KRT8) and type I keratins (KRT10, KRT18, KRT19). High abundance of keratins is in agreement with their known importance as structural stabilizers of epithelial cells given their polimerization into keratin filaments. Intracellularly, they braid the nucleus, span through the cytoplasm and are attached to the cytoplasmic plaques of the desmosomes. Thus, it seems that they are inherent part of the continuum of stability from the single cell to the tissue formation [67]. Identification of tubulin isoforms (TUBB2A and TUBA1A) among the most abundant proteins (mNE), is in accordance with its role in airway epithelium as building blocks of cilia of tall columnar cells besides being important components of cytoskeleton microtubules [68].",

The majority of the studies were focused on human nasal lavage fluid (NLF) and only three elected nasal cells as biological material for investigation of human nasal epithelium proteome, all using a 2D-PAGE-MALDI-TOF-MS approach [10], [11], [12]. By comparing that data (160 proteins in total) with our own (1482 proteins), we observed only 61 commonly proteins identified, confirming that 2D-PAGE is a complementary tool in proteomics although limitative (Fig. 6\n) [71]. Out of the studies describing the microenvironment of human nasal epithelium based on nasal lavage fluid analysis, a comprehensive investigation of this human sample was performed by Casado et al.(2005), using capillary LC coupled to an ESI-Q-TOF MS equipment as an approach to produce a profile of proteins in NLF from healthy subjects [70]. From the 67 IPA mapped-proteins described in Casado's work, 43 proteins were highlighted in our own work (results not shown). This group of proteins includes many secreted proteins involved in innate and acquired immunity (e.g., immunoglobulins and proteins secreted by serous and mucous cells) but also components of plasma as a result from exudation and cellular cytoskeleton (e.g., keratins).",

This search delivered five references (Fig. SD3), describing proteomic studies referred above on human nasal lavage [70], [72], human olfactory cleft mucus [73] and human bronchial airway epithelium brushing [74]. In the last study, Steiling and co-workers used bronchial epithelial cells harvested by brushing the mainstream bronchus to investigate molecular changes induced by tobacco exposure on a transcript and protein level. Data coming from protein profiling was extracted (859 proteins) for further comparison with NE proteome herein obtained (1482 proteins). IPA's comparison revealed that about 540 proteins are commonly expressed in both airway epithelia (Fig. SD4, details available in Table SD7). Despite using a 1D-PAGE-LC-MS/MS strategy, which is compatible with membrane analysis, the nature of these overlapping proteins is mainly soluble and the major molecular function associated to this group of proteins is catalytic activity, including oxireductase and hydrolase activities. Among these, several proteins are annotated in HPRD as being expressed in respiratory system (e.g., nasal and bronchial epithelium, lungs and bronchoalveolar fluid) as is the case of PLUNC protein, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and aldehyde dehydrogenase 3B1, annotated as being expressed in bronchial epithelial cells, airway epithelia and lung, respectively. In the present work, proteins such as CD44, HLA-DRA, mucin 1 transmembrane and aquaporin 5 are examples of proteins described in mNE that are also annotated in HPRD as expressed in bronchial epithelial cells but failed their identification in Steiling's work.",

Lung cancer appears as the pathology with more associated proteins (75 out of the 141). However, other diseases emerged from IPA's analysis, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or pneumonitis (Table SD4e). Two proteins, NOS2 and TPI1, have been associated with asthma while MPO and LTF have been involved in the development of cystic fibrosis [76], [77]. Significantly, several of those proteins are among the top 100 most abundant proteins, as is the case for AGR2, ALDH3A1, ALDOA, GSN, HSP90AA1, HSP90B1, KRT5, KRT19, PPIA, S100P, SERPINB3, TMSB4X, TPI1, TUBA1A, VIM, YWHAE, S100A4, CTSB, previously associated with development, progression and or metastasis of lung cancer and also ACTA2, GAPDH, HBB, HSP90B1, S100A4, S100A9, S100P, TALDO1, TXN, associated with other respiratory disorders. This is also the case of two key proteins, previously described in cystic fibrosis mouse model by our group [78], retinal dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) along with ADH7, which were found to be crucial enzymes in retinoic acid metabolism, a hormone known as important regulator of organ development and homeostasis, including the lung [79]. Expression of ALDH1A1 in airway epithelium has already been confirmed by in situhybridization of embryonic lung [80]. As recently referred by Bossi and Lehner [81], these proteins might fall on the group of \u201cuniversally expressed housekeeping proteins\u201d, which brings the clinical proteomics field to the future challenge of, not only completing characterization of each cell type that comprise airway epithelium, but also most importantly, defining particular interactions that can occur in that tissue that could be associated with the pathophysiology of respiratory diseases such as asthma, CF and COPD.",

Here, we present the most complete proteome profiling of NE to date. We employed an improved subcellular fractionation method followed by a high sensitive multidimensional protein identification technology unraveling mechanisms and processes intimately correlated with normal and pathological lung function. Most of the identified NE proteome overlaps with the previously described ones for bronchial epithelia providing extra consistency related to the usefulness of these cells in lower airways epithelia research.",
