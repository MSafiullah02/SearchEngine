            "text": "Interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3) have emerged as important gatekeepers of pathogen infection in vertebrates1. Initial siRNA knockdown studies of IFITM3 increased the susceptibility of mammalian cell lines to influenza A virus (IAV), and overexpression showed that IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 could also inhibit infection by other strains of IAV as well as flaviviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV), with IFITM3 being the most active against IAV2. In addition to IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3, humans have two other IFITM isoforms (5 and 10) and mice have four others (5, 6, 7 and 10) that are not induced by IFNs1\u20133. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 are active against many other viruses1,3, including Ebola virus (EBOV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), non-enveloped mammalian reovirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)4,5. IFITMs are, however, not active against DNA viruses such as papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus and adenovirus6 and even promote human coronavirus OC43 infection7,8. SiRNA knockdown of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 together has also been reported to increase Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in macrophages9. Moreover, IFITM3 was shown to associate with Mtb in late endosomal compartments and found to restrict Mtb by imaging flow cytometry9. IFITMs are active in multiple mammalian cell types, including primary CD8+ T cells and respiratory dendritic cells directly involved in adaptive immunity to IAV10. Notably, ifitm3\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to infection by IAV11,12. Moreover, IFITM3 appears to be important for the intrinsic and inducible antiviral activity of human embryonic stem cells13. IFITMs have also been suggested to limit virus infection in a variety of other vertebrates1,3, highlighting their possible evolutionarily conserved function in host immunity.",

            "text": "IFITMs encode relatively small membrane proteins (107\u2013144 amino acids)1 that were originally predicted to be dual-pass transmembrane proteins based on two hydrophobic domains2 (Fig. 1a). However, subsequent epitope mapping studies in cells14\u201316 and preliminary structural studies in vitro17 have suggested that IFITMs are type IV membrane proteins in which only the second hydrophobic domain is a transmembrane domain, with the C terminus facing the outside of cells. In contrast, the first hydrophobic domain of IFITM3 is suggested to function as an amphipathic helix and regulate interactions with the inner leaflet of host membranes18. This IFITM membrane topology model is also supported by the discovery of post-translational modifications on IFITM3 (S-fatty-acylation of Cys71, Cys72 and Cys105, phosphorylation of Tyr20, ubiquitination of Lys24, Lys83, Lys88 and Lys104 and methylation of Lys88)19. In mammalian cells, IFITM2 and IFITM3 are mostly distributed through early and late endocytic vesicles and on lysosomes, as shown by immunofluorescence1,3,19 and live-cell imaging studies20. IFITM1 has a truncated N terminus, lacks the AP2 sorting motif (YXX\u03a6) found in IFITM2 and IFITM3, and shows more plasma membrane localization1,3,19. The cellular localization of the IFITMs may be a crucial determinant for their specificities toward viruses, as IFITM1 is more active against viruses that enter through the plasma membrane or early endocytic vesicles, whereas IFITM2 and IFITM3 are more active against viruses that enter within late endocytic compartments1,3,19. In humans, individuals with the IFITM3 SNP rs12252-C allele, which encodes a predicted 21-amino acid truncation of the N terminus (IFITM3-N21\u0394), show increased morbidity and mortality from H1N1 strains of IAV12. The IFITM3 rs12252-C allele is more prevalent in Asian populations21 and is associated with fatal IAV H7N9 infection22,23, as well as acute HIV-1 infection24. However, recent meta-analyses25\u201327, overexpression studies28 and direct transcript analyses29 have challenged the significance of this allele in humans. Further studies of IFITM3 SNPs have identified rs34481144 as another loss-of-function allele in the IFITM3 5\u2032 UTR that results in lower mRNA expression, which correlates with reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells in patient airways and increased severity of influenza-mediated illness30. These studies highlight that IFITMs are highly regulated in mammalian cells and are important for host susceptibility to diverse pathogens.",

Overexpression studies showed that IFITMs do not affect the expression levels of host ligands and receptors for viruses (for example, sialic acid levels)2 or uptake of IAV particles into mammalian cells31, suggesting that these small membrane proteins may interfere with intermediate or late stages of virus entry rather than initial binding or internalization into host cells. Notably, overexpression of IFITM3 appears to arrest internalized virus particles within endocytic vesicles and prevent the translocation of viral contents into the cytosol31. Overexpression studies have also suggested that IFITM3 expands Rab7- and LAMP1-positive late endocytic compartments31 and potentially alters the localization and activity of v-ATPase32 without affecting lysosomal cathepsin activity33. Alternatively, overexpression studies have also suggested that IFITMs can influence cell\u2013cell fusion34 or indirectly alter intracellular cholesterol homeostasis35 to block viral hemifusion with host membranes. However, live-cell imaging of IAV entry and lipid mixing has shown that IFITMs do not affect virus hemifusion in endosomes36 or localization to endosomes37, indicating a possible role in blocking fusion pore formation. Interestingly, IFITMs may also be incorporated in HIV-1 virions and other viruses to inhibit virus spreading or be transferred through exosomes to propagate antiviral activity to neighboring cells38. The broad activity of IFITMs against different classes of viruses and perhaps even intracellular bacterial pathogens suggests a general mechanism of action that is functional in many different cell types. However, the lack of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 mutant cell lines and tools for live imaging of IFITMs has limited their direct mechanistic investigation in host cells during infection, as well as dissection of their regulatory mechanisms.",

We discovered that IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 act cooperatively in IFN-stimulated cells against diverse viruses (IAV, VSV, DENV, WNV and ZIKV) and enhance the trafficking of both endogenous (activated EGFR) and exogenous (virus particles) cargo in late endocytic vesicles to lysosomes for degradation. Using live-cell IFITM3 imaging experiments, we observed that internalized IAV particles primarily undergo lipid mixing or hemifusion with host membranes after fusion of virus-bearing vesicles with IFITM3-positive vesicles. The prefusion colocalization of virus particles with IFITM3-positive vesicles was specific to restricted viruses (IAV and EBOV) and was markedly decreased with loss-of-function IFITM3 mutants such as the N21\u0394 SNP rs12252-C allele. We also demonstrated that site-specific S-fatty-acylation of Cys72 is important for IFITM3 trafficking to incoming IAV particles. Collectively, our results showed that IFITM3 can engage vesicles bearing incoming virus particles and promote shuttling of late endocytic cargo to lysosomes for degradation, which highlights a general mechanism by which IFITMs may intercept pathogens and prevent their entry into host cells. These studies were uniquely enabled by site-specific protein labeling and imaging methods, which should also facilitate the functional analysis of other host factors involved in pathogen restriction as well as their mechanisms of regulation.",

Among the gRNAs we evaluated targeting exon 1 of human IFITM3 (Supplementary Fig. 1b), gRNA3 afforded the most efficient cleavage of genomic IFITM3 (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Western blot analysis of CRISPR\u2013Cas9-gRNA3-transfected stable cell clones after puromycin selection yielded several HeLa and A549 clones with decreased and/or deleted IFITM2 and IFITM3 using an N-terminally-directed antibody that cross-reacts with both proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Because human IFITM2 and IFITM3 have high sequence identity in their first exons and also flank IFITM1 on chromosome 11, we evaluated the expression of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 using isoform-specific antibodies (Fig. 1b). From this analysis, we identified HeLa cell clones with reduced expression in IFITM2 (C4\u20134), IFITM3 (C345\u20135), or both (C5-2, IFITM2/3-KO), as well as one clone that showed loss of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 expression (C5-9) compared to Cas9 empty-vector-treated HeLa cells (WT HeLa) (Fig. 1b). For A549 cells, we only isolated IFITM2/IFITM3 double KO clones with partially reduced expression of IFITM1 (C1\u20133) (Fig. 1c).

            "text": "We next evaluated the virus susceptibility of these HeLa and A549 IFITM (1, 2 and 3) mutant cell lines with and without IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Infection of the HeLa cell clones with IAV (A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) strain) showed that reduced expression of IFITM2 or IFITM3 increased virus susceptibility approximately two- or four-fold, respectively, compared to controls (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 1e). However, HeLa cell clones with complete loss of IFITM2 and IFITM3 (C5-2, IFITM2/3-KO) or all three isoforms (C5-9) exhibited greater than 20-fold increased infection, as judged by anti-influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) staining (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 1e). The cooperative antiviral activity among IFITMs was even more pronounced in IFN-\u03b1 treated cells, in which reduced expression of IFITM2 or IFITM3 alone did not have a major effect on IAV infection, whereas deletion of both or all three isoforms again resulted in greater than 20-fold increased susceptibility (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 1e). No significant difference in IAV infection of clones with KO of IFITM2/3 (C5-2,) or all three isoforms (C5-9) was observed, even with IFN-\u03b1 treatment (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 1e), suggesting that IFITM1 does not play a significant role in preventing IAV infection. In contrast, the analysis of IFITM mutant cell lines with other viruses showed that VSV and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) infected na\u00efve HeLa cell clones at similar levels, but with IFN-\u03b1 treatment, reduced expression or deletion of IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 increased infection, particularly when all three isoforms were deleted (Supplementary Fig. 1f). DENV also showed increased infectivity in the na\u00efve IFITM-mutant HeLa cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 1f). However, loss of IFITM2 or IFITM3 expression alone in IFN-\u03b1 treated cells only partially attenuated DENV infection compared to HeLa cells without IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 (Supplementary Fig. 1f). YFV and o\u2019nyong\u2019nyong virus (ONNV) showed enhanced infection of na\u00efve IFITM-mutant cells but were attenuated with IFN-\u03b1 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 1f), suggesting that other IFN-effectors also contribute to host restriction of these viruses. We observed similar trends with virus infections of na\u00efve and IFN-\u03b1 treated IFITM2/3-mutant A549 cells compared to wild-type (WT) controls (Supplementary Fig. 1g). To confirm that the virus susceptibility was indeed due to reduced expression or deletion of IFITM2 or IFITM3, we generated stable clones reconstituted with IFITM2 or IFITM3. In the HeLa IFITM2/3-KO clone (C5-2), we generated cells expressing low, medium or near-WT levels of IFITM3 and a clone expressing only IFITM2 (Fig. 1e). IAV infection of these HeLa cell lines showed dose-dependent antiviral activity by IFITM3 and indicated that IFITM3 or IFITM2 expression alone was sufficient to render these IFITM2/3-KO HeLa and A549 cells resistant to virus infection (Fig. 1f). These results show that human IFITM3 functions in a dose-dependent manner and may be redundant with IFITM2 toward some viruses, but it may act synergistically with IFITM1 to restrict a broad spectrum of viruses in IFN-stimulated cells. At endogenous levels in IFN-stimulated cells, IFITM2 and IFITM3 are most important for IAV and VEEV, whereas all three IFITMs are involved in preventing VSV and DENV infections.",

Immunofluorescence analysis showed that endogenous as well as reconstituted IFITM3 is present on intracellular vesicular structures that partially colocalize with CD63-positive late endocytic compartments in IFN-\u03b1 treated A549 cells (Fig. 2a). Fluorescence imaging of endocytic markers (GFP-Rab5a, GFP-Rab7a and LAMP1-mCherry) did not show significant differences in the distribution of early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes between A549 WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). We also did not observe significant enlargement or expansion of LAMP1-mCherry compartments in IFN-\u03b1-treated control cells compared to IFITM2/3-KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), in contrast to results of previous IFITM3 overexpression studies31. Moreover, the uptake of exogenous cargo (dextran particles) was similar between IFN-\u03b1-treated WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). IFN-\u03b1-treated WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells also exhibited similar labeling with fluorogenic cell-penetrating peptides that enter through the endocytic pathway39 (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results collectively suggest that IFITM2 and IFITM3 do not significantly regulate early endocytic events or generally alter endocytic vesicle membrane permeability.",

            "text": "As early endocytic events are not affected and endogenous IFITM3 is mainly localized to late endosomes or lysosomes, we evaluated whether IFITM2/3 may affect late endocytic vesicle cargo trafficking and degradation. Our initial pulse-chase labeling studies with fluorescent dextran particles suggested that exogenous cargo trafficking to lysosomes was modestly delayed in IFN-\u03b1 treated IFITM2/3-KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). To evaluate the trafficking and degradation of endogenous endocytic cargo, we focused on the turnover of activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is one of the major sialylated cell surface receptors for IAV40 and is readily detectable in A549 cells. While the cell surface levels of EGFR were similar in WT and IFITM2/3-KO A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a), following EGF-stimulation of IFN-\u03b1-treated A549 cells, EGFR was largely degraded after 90 min (Fig. 2b,c). Notably, EGFR turnover was markedly delayed in IFN-\u03b1-treated IFITM2/3-KO cells, with significant levels still present after 90 min (Fig. 2b,c). Stable reconstitution of IFITM3 in IFN-\u03b1-treated IFITM2/3-KO cells rescued and even accelerated the degradation of EGFR (Fig. 2b,c). By contrast, treatment of these cells with transferrin (Tf) in the same time frame (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c) suggests IFITM2 and IFITM3 do not significantly affect the turnover of activated transferrin receptor (TfR, CD71), a GPI-anchor-modified membrane protein that is recycled to the plasma membrane. Analysis of lysosomal protease activity using a fluorogenic cathepsin B substrate and cysteine protease activity-based profiling showed similar levels of endolysosomal proteolytic activity in IFN-\u03b1-treated A549 and HeLa cells regardless of IFITM2/3 expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). These data, together with pulse-chase analysis of fluorescent-dextran particles, suggest that IFITM2 and IFITM3 do not significantly alter endolysosomal protease activity but may enhance the trafficking of late endocytic cargo to lysosomes for degradation, even in the absence of virus infection.",

            "text": "To investigate the effects of IFITMs on viral entry and trafficking, we employed live-cell fluorescence microscopy to monitor individual IAV particles during synchronized infection. Using a membrane-incorporated dye, 1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD), which readily labels IAV particles in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 5) and exhibits fluorescence dequenching upon hemifusion or full fusion between viral and endosomal membranes41, we were able to track viral membrane fusion, as indicated by glycoprotein-mediated lipid mixing, and monitor the trafficking of virus-fused vesicles. Because IAV is known to fuse with late endosomes, we first evaluated IAV lipid mixing and trafficking in WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells transduced to express LAMP1-GFP. These experiments were performed in HeLa cells, which exhibit less contour than A549 cells and enabled more comprehensive quantitative imaging of DiD-IAV particles by wide-field epifluorescence microscopy. IAV lipid mixing occurred almost exclusively in LAMP1-positive compartments (Fig. 3a,b; Supplementary Video 1). The rate at which IAV particles underwent lipid mixing was similar in WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells (Fig. 3c, black and white circles), with a t1/2 of approximately 41 min for both. In IFN-\u03b1-treated cells, the DiD-IAV dequenching rate was delayed in IFITM2/3-KO HeLa cells compared to WT cells (Fig. 3c, black and white squares). The t1/2 for lipid mixing in IFN-treated IFITM2/3-KO HeLa cells occurred 11 min later than that in WT cells. Moreover, the trafficking of DiD-IAV particles to LAMP1-positive compartments in IFN-\u03b1-treated WT HeLa cells was also ~10 min faster, on average, even though virus trafficking times may vary widely even in synchronized infections (Fig. 3d). No significant difference in trafficking of DiD-IAV particles to LAMP1-positive compartments was observed in unstimulated cells (Fig. 3d). Although IFN-\u03b1 treatment reduced the relative amount of dequenched DiD-IAV particles, the percentage of dequenched DiD-IAV particles (Fig. 3e) and the degree of colocalization with LAMP1-positive compartments were similar between HeLa WT and IFITM2/3-KO cells at 2 h post-infection (Fig. 3f). These results show that IFN-\u03b1 treatment impacts the kinetics, but not total extent, of viral lipid mixing in IFITM2/3-KO cells compared to WT cells, which suggests that IFITM2 and IFITM3 primarily influence the rate of virus trafficking to late endosomal compartments rather than the gross composition of the endosomal milieu, consistent with our data on dextran particle trafficking (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d) EGFR (Fig. 2b,c) and TfR turnover (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c).",

Briefly, the co-transfection of mammalian cells with plasmids encoding with HA-IFITM3-F8-TAG and Mm-PylRS-AF/Pyl-tRNACUA enables site-specific incorporation of trans-cyclooct-2-ene-lysine (TCOK) and subsequent bioorthogonal labeling with BODIPY-tetrazine (BODIPY-Tz) (Supplementary Fig. 7). Importantly, HA-IFITM3-F8-TCOK labeled with BODIPY-Tz retains antiviral activity toward IAV (Supplementary Fig. 8a). The analysis of IFITM3 expression levels by \u03b1-IFITM3 antibody staining showed that HA-IFITM3 site-specifically labeled with TCOK in IFITM2/3-KO cells yielded slightly lower levels of total protein compared to WT HeLa cells \u00b1 IFN-\u03b1, as shown by western blot and flow cytometry analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8b,c), and a similar pattern of vesicle staining as indicated by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 8d).

Instead, we observed a significantly greater overlap of BODIPY-IFITM3 with Rab7 (MCC 0.98 \u00b1 0.06) and LAMP1 (MCC 0.97 \u00b1 0.03) (Supplementary Fig. 9), which shows that IFITM3 largely resides in late endocytic vesicles and is consistent with previous immunofluorescence9,16,33,35 and live-cell imaging studies of IFITM3 in WT HeLa cells20. Using DiD-labeled IAV and epifluorescence imaging, we observed BODIPY-IFITM3 colocalization with the majority of internalized virus particles before lipid mixing (Fig. 4a,b; Supplementary Video 2), with another 20 percent of DiD-dequenching events occurring in compartments without detectable BODIPY-IFITM3 (Fig. 4c). In these latter events, BODIPY-IFITM3 vesicles were observed to colocalize with DiD-dequenched puncta later in time, where secondary DiD dequenching events could occasionally be observed (Fig. 4d; Supplementary Video 3). This secondary DiD dequenching likely represents further dye diffusion due to endosome fusion with an IFITM3-positive vesicle and expansion of the limiting membrane. Reintroduction of IFITM3 into HeLa IFITM2/3-KO cells did not significantly alter the total percentage of IAV particles undergoing lipid mixing by 2 h post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Consistent with our previous experiments (Fig. 3), these results show that although virus particles may fuse with IFITM3-positive vesicles, IFITM3 does not significantly inhibit IAV lipid mixing or hemifusion with endocytic membranes. More importantly, IFITM3 colocalized with nearly 80 percent of DiD-IAV particles at the time of lipid mixing (Fig. 4e), but this was markedly decreased with VSV particles pseudotyped with the glycoprotein complex (GPC) of Lassa virus (LASV), a late-penetrating arenavirus that is not restricted by IFITMs2 (Fig. 4e; Supplementary Video 4). In these experiments, both IAV and LASV GPC-pseudotyped VSV still trafficked to late endocytic compartments, as indicated by colocalization with LAMP1 (Fig. 4e), and the extent of colocalization of both viruses with IFITM3 at 1 h post-infection was similar (Supplementary Fig. 10b). However, most LASV GPC-bearing particles dequenched before their endosomes acquired IFITM3 (Fig. 4f), whereas IAV dequenching generally occurred shortly after colocalization with IFITM3 (Fig. 4f). To further investigate the specificity of IFITM3 trafficking toward restricted viruses, we analyzed VSV particles pseudotyped with the glycoprotein of Ebola virus (EBOV), a late endosome/lysosome-entering virus that is restricted by IFITM3 (refs. 33,42). Like IAV, the majority of DiD-EBOV particles colocalized with IFITM3 prior to lipid mixing (Fig. 4e,f). These results demonstrate for the first time that incoming virus particles interact with IFITM3-positive vesicles before fusion and that this phenomenon is specific to restricted viruses such as IAV and EBOV.",

In particular, we evaluated the rs12252-C allele of IFITM3 that yields an N21\u0394 truncation mutant and is suggested to affect host cell susceptibility to IAV infection12,43. Stable expression of IFITM3-N21\u0394 in A549 IFITM2/3-KO cells revealed more peripheral plasma membrane distribution (Supplementary Fig. 11a), lower protein levels and reduced antiviral activity against IAV compared to WT IFITM3 (Supplementary Fig. 11b,c), consistent with previous studies12,43. Moreover, IFITM3-N21\u0394 also exhibited decreased antiviral activity toward IAV and ZIKV, in contrast to the similar levels of full-length IFITM2 or IFITM3 in HeLa IFITM2/3-KO (C5-2) cells (Fig. 5a\u2013c). To analyze IFITM3-N21\u0394 trafficking during IAV infection, we generated a HA-IFITM3-N21\u0394-V93-TAG construct for site-specific fluorophore labeling with BODIPY-Tz. Whereas wide-field epifluorescence microscopy showed that the BODIPY-labeled IFITM3 constructs were primarily in intracellular vesicles (Supplementary Fig. 12), confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that HA-IFITM3-N21\u0394-V93-BODIPY exhibited slightly more co-staining with a plasma membrane marker compared to the HA-IFITM3-F8-BODIPY and HA-IFITM3-V93-BODIPY constructs (Supplementary Fig. 13a,b). For DiD-IAV imaging studies, we observed a 55% reduction in the number of IAV particles colocalized with IFITM3-N21\u0394 at the time of lipid mixing relative to WT IFITM3 (Fig. 5d\u2013f), indicating that the truncated protein is less likely to be incorporated into, but not completely absent from, endosomal compartments supporting viral fusion (Fig. 5d\u2013f). Reintroduction of WT IFITM3 and IFITM3-N21\u0394 into HeLa IFITM2/3-KO cells also did not significantly alter the total percentage of IAV particles undergoing lipid mixing by 2 h post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 10c). These results demonstrate that a quantitative difference in IFITM3 trafficking to incoming virus particles is correlated with altered steady state localization and antiviral activity, further suggesting that direct engagement or fusion of IFITM3-positive vesicles with pathogens is important for its cellular mechanism of action.",

            "text": "To further investigate mechanisms that control IFITM3 trafficking to virus particles, we analyzed site-specific mutants of S-palmitoylation14,44,45. Previous studies from our group demonstrated that Cys72 in human IFITM3 is the most prominent site of S-palmitoylation45,46 and is crucial for antiviral activity toward IAV45,47 as well as DENV47. However, the mechanism by which site-specific S-palmitoylation regulates IFITM3 antiviral activity is unclear, as similar levels of steady state protein expression and cellular localization patterns were observed with WT IFITM3 and individual Ala mutants at Cys71, Cys72 and Cys105 (ref. 45). We therefore generated F8-TAG constructs of these IFITM3 Cys-to-Ala mutants and analyzed their trafficking properties during IAV entry. These IFITM3 Cys-to-Ala mutants were expressed at similar levels to WT IFITM3-F8-TAG and showed decreased levels of S-fatty-acylation in HeLa IFITM2/3-KO (C5-2) cells, particularly with the C72A mutant (Supplementary Fig. 14a,b). Although the relative levels of site-specific S-fatty-acylation on these TAG-modified constructs of human IFITM3 are less dramatic than those of our previous studies with murine IFITM3 (ref. 45), Cys72 is still the most prominent site of modification46. Importantly, mutation of Cys72 to Ala most significantly decreased the antiviral activity of IFITM3 toward IAV, whereas Cys71 and Cys105 Ala mutants retained more activity (Supplementary Fig. 14c), consistent with previous studies from our group45 and others47. The steady state localization of these BODIPY-labeled constructs was similar to that in WT IFITM3 (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 15). However, the trafficking and colocalization of the IFITM3-C72A mutant with dequenched DiD-IAV particles were significantly decreased to ~20% compared to WT IFITM3 or Ala mutants at Cys71 and Cys105 (Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. 16). In comparison to WT, IFITM3-C72A mutant trafficking to DiD-IAV particles was also delayed (Supplementary Fig. 14d). These results show that although S-fatty-acylation does not significantly affect IFITM3 steady state cellular distribution, site-specific S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 at Cys72 is important for its rate of trafficking to IAV particles during infection, which was only revealed by site-specific fluorophore labeling and live-cell imaging.",

Nonetheless, the precise cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action for these small membrane proteins have been challenging to elucidate. By generating single and multiple IFITM-deficient mammalian cell lines, we demonstrated that IFITM2 and IFITM3 may be redundant and act synergistically with IFITM1 toward different restricted viruses in na\u00efve and IFN-\u03b1-stimulated cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these IFITMs function in a dose-dependent fashion and do not affect early stages of exogenous cargo or pathogen uptake, but rather enhance the trafficking and turnover of late endocytic cargo to lysosomes. In the absence of infection, IFITM2/3-deficient cells stimulated with IFN-\u03b1 showed slower rates of EGFR turnover. During IAV infection, we observed that fluorescently labeled IAV particles enter host cells and undergo hemifusion at similar rates in WT and IFITM2/3-deficient cells, consistent with previous siRNA knockdown studies of IFITM3 (ref. 36). However, in IFITM2/3-KO cells we observed that fluorescently labeled IAV particles traffic to lysosomes approximately 10 min more slowly on average. Our findings suggest that beyond potentially inhibiting virus pore formation36, IFITM2/3 may prevent virus entry by altering rates of virus-endosome fusion and/or accelerating the trafficking of endosomal cargo to lysosomes for destruction.",

Using site-specific fluorophore labeling of IFITM3 in mammalian cells, we were able to directly visualize IFITM3 trafficking with fluorescently labeled virus particles and observed for the first time that IFITM3-positive vesicles fuse with incoming virus-bearing vesicles before hemifusion. Importantly, the IFITM3-positive vesicle fusion and colocalization before hemifusion were specific to restricted viruses such as IAV and pseudotyped EBOV, but not LASV-pseudotyped virus particles, and colocalization was significantly reduced with loss-of-function mutants such as IFITM3-N21\u0394. The ability of IFITMs to engage endosomes bearing incoming virus particles and enhance their trafficking to late endocytic compartments provides an important mechanism to explain the specificity of IFITMs against different viruses and potentially predicts points of viral entry into host cells. Different viruses may therefore initiate fusion in different subsets of late endo/lysosomal compartments and exhibit differential sensitivity to IFN effector expression levels and trafficking properties. These interactions are not readily apparent from bulk viral entry studies, which highlight the utility of our site-specific protein labeling and live single-particle imaging approaches that should facilitate future studies on virus-host factor dynamics.",

            "text": "Our ability to image IFITM3 trafficking in live cells has not only revealed interactions with pathogens during infection, but also uncovered how post-translational modifications regulate the function of these small membrane proteins. We initially discovered IFITM3 S-fatty-acylation14,44 and determined endogenous levels45 and specific sites of modification45,46, as well as confirmed its modification with palmitic acid46. Although these results have also been confirmed by others47\u201349 and have been shown for IFITM5 (ref. 50), how S-palmitoylation at Cys72 regulated IFITM3 antiviral activity was unclear from steady state localization studies. Using site-specific fluorophore labeling and live-cell imaging during infection, we now observe that inhibition of S-palmitoylation at Cys72, but not Cys71 or Cys105, by site-directed mutagenesis impairs IFITM3 trafficking to incoming IAV particles and thus reveals how site-specific S-palmitoylation regulates IFITM3 antiviral activity. The chemical imaging approach described here has uncovered important aspects of how IFITMs engage pathogens during infection, as well as key regulatory mechanisms, and should facilitate the analysis of other host factors involved in pathogen restriction. Nonetheless, key questions still remain regarding the cellular pathway and biochemical mechanism by which these IFN-effectors prevent pathogen entry and accelerate trafficking of incoming viral particles to lysosomes for destruction. Our ability to conduct site-specific labeling IFITM3 with unique chemical reactivity should enable additional imaging studies, discovery of specific protein-protein interaction partners and reconstitution of lipidated isoforms for biochemical and structural studies in the future.",
