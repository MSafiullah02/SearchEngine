            "text": "It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may use ACE2 as a receptor to gain entry into human cells, in a way similar to that of SARS-CoV. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of ACE2 may therefore help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we utilized previously uploaded information on ACE2 expression in various conditions including SARS-CoA to evaluate the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV and extrapolate that to COVID-19. We found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different. However, based on the elevated expression of ACE2 in cigarette smokers, we speculate that long-term smoking may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Analysis of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings may help clinicians and researchers gain more insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and design therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.",

Later, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 was identified based on sequencing of respiratory tract samples from these patients. As of April 12, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed patients and more than 3000 deaths have been reported in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. Analysis of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed that this new virus shares about 80-90% sequence identity to the original SARS-CoV. Both bioinformatics modeling and in vitro experiments indicate that 2019-nCoV likely utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to gain entry into human cells [2, 3] .",

            "text": "ACE2, discovered in 2000, shares 40% identity and 61% similarity with ACE [4] . The full-length protein structure of ACE2 consists of an Nterminal and a C-terminal domain with a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular segment [5] . Considering the difference in active sites between ACE2 and ACE, the functions of these two enzymes are distinct. Unlike ACE, which converts angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (AngII), ACE2 converts Ang II to Ang-(1-(1 and Ang I to Ang-(1-9) [6, 7] . ACE2 is expressed in different tissues, such as renal, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal [8, 9] . ACE2 is also present in lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells [10] . ACE2 was previously identified as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV and HCoVhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102463 Received 21 March 2020; Received in revised form 9 April 2020; Accepted 10 April 2020 NL63 [11, 12] . Considering that the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV and that SARS-CoV-2 appears to use the same ACE2 receptor to enter cells, analyses of ACE2 expression and distribution in lung and related biological processes may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.",

The main symptoms of patients with COVID-19 infection were interstitial changes in the lung as demonstrated by chest CT. Severe pulmonary interstitial disease leads to hypoxemia and type I respiratory distress, which is related to the prognosis of patients. SARS-CoV-2 invades the lungs through the respiratory tract and causes severe pneumonia, which is the most frequent presentation. It has been found that SARS-CoV-2 is able to bind to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of epithelial cells. Zhou et al. further confirmed that ACE2 is necessary for infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2 [2] . We accessed and analyzed six independent studies (GSE37768, GSE73395, GSE89809, GSE63127, GSE97010, and GSE17400), covering a healthy We showed that ACE2 was found in all of the samples including the healthy population and patients with chronic airway diseases. Thus, there may be no significant difference in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection between a healthy population and patients with chronic respiratory diseases. In contrast, current limited data on COVID-19 suggests that patients with underlying lung conditions may be at greater risk for severe chronic airway disease or death.",

Moreover, ACE2 is also related to adaptive immune responses [17] . In this current study, GSEA analysis showed that the high expression of ACE2 was related to innate immune responses, adaptive immune responses, B cell regulation and cytokine secretion, as well as an enhanced inflammatory response induced by IL-1, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8. We speculate that the immune system dysfunction involved in the high expression of ACE2 is related to the symptoms of a cytokine storm. A clinical study in Wuhan pointed out that the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10 and IL-8 were significantly increased in critically ill patients with new coronavirus infection, indicating that the pathologic process may involve an exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response [1] . This may be related to pyroptosis, which has been suggested as another pathogenic mechanism involved in COVID-19 infection. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of apoptosis. The fact that tissue injury and death may be related to a pro-inflammatory process resulting from the viral infection suggests that the use of IL-1\u03b2 blockers or IL-18 blockers may have some benefit in COVID-19 patients.",

It has been shown that RPS3 plays an important role in cell mitosis by interacting with \u03b1-tubulin. When cells are infected with HIV-1, HIV-1 Tat protein can interact with RPS3 and disturb its localization on the spindle, and ultimately inhibit cell proliferation [18] .

Ang2 induced vascular permeability and lung injury is facilitated by binding to the Angiotensin-2 receptor type 1 (AT1R) [26] . In a mouse model, SARS-CoV induced lung injury can be attenuated by blocking AT1R [27] .

It is postulated that this may be related to the higher mortality in Chinese patients with COVID-19 who have hypertension as a comorbidity. Additionally, ACE2 null mice display reduced cardiac contractility. If ACE2 is downregulated by SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding to ACE2, this may explain why cardiac impairment is observed to be a significant characteristic of patients who die from COVID-19 [32] Fig. 5 .",

Additionally, DPP-4 was found to be an entry receptor for MERS, but this has not yet been shown in SARS-CoV-2. A further consideration and potential target for treatment may relate to the role of ADAM-17. While ACE2 is a membrane bound protein, it is cleaved by ADAM-17 leading to shedding to form soluble ACE2. ADAM-17 therefore may lead to a decrease in membrane bound ACE2, reducing its regulatory activity. AT1R upregulates ADAM-17, so use of an ARB may potentially block shedding and reduction of membrane bound ACE2. However, it is believed that the majority of ACE2 is membrane bound and that the decrease resulting from shedding would not significantly affect ACE2 activity to begin with [33] .",

Due to human-human transmission of the virus, cases have easily spread across borders and has led to the need to implement disruptive quarantine procedures. Our current study found that there was no significant difference in ACE2 expression between a healthy population and patients with chronic airway disease. The activation of neutrophils, NK cells, Th17 cells, Th2 cells, Th1 cells, dendritic cells, TNF\u03b1 secreting cells can be induced by overexpression of ACE2 leading to a severe inflammatory response. A schematic model is showed in Fig. 4 . These findings may help clinicians and researchers gain more insight into the pathogenesis and use this to design therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Note that all results in this study are based on data mining and basic science and translational studies are required to confirm these models.",

SARS-COV-2 virus uses the ACE2 receptor to gain entry into the cell, leading to the increase in proinflammatory cytokines and the development of cytokine storm, as well as increased viral replication (see Fig. 4 ). TMPRSS2 assists in S protein priming. ARBs may potentially increase the expression of ACE2, leading increased binding of SARS-CoV-2 and greater proinflammatory cytokine production. SARS-CoV-2 may at the same time downregulate ACE2, which leads to an increase in angiotensin 2 mediated lung injury. The negative regulatory activity of ACE2 is reduced by SARS-CoV-2 and leads to worsening severity of illness.",
