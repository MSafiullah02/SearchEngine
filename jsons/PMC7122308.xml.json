To a similar extent, it has been said that to know sepsis is to know critical care medicine [1]. Overwhelming sepsis and septic shock often manifest with concurrent derangements in cardiovascular function, intravascular volume status, respiratory function, immune/inflammatory regulation, renal function, coagulation, hepatic function, and metabolic function \u2013 sepsis literally affects every organ system to some degree. The degree to which any of these derangements are manifest in a given child is highly variable and influenced by multiple host and pathogen factors, including the child\u2019s developmental stage, the presence or absence of co-morbidities, the host\u2019s immune/inflammatory state, the host\u2019s genetic background, and the specific pathogens involved. These factors combine, in turn, to profoundly influence the ultimate outcome.",

Modern intensive care and a better understanding of this disease have led to significant improvements in mortality. For example, sepsis associated mortality decreased from a majority of children in 1966 (i.e., close to 100 %) [2] to approximately 10 % among children in developed countries today [3, 4]. Despite the tremendous advances made in the last few decades, the morbidity and mortality attributed to sepsis remain unacceptably high. Severe sepsis is still one of the leading causes of death in children with almost 4,500 deaths reported annually in the United States alone [5]. Worldwide, especially in developing countries, the toll of sepsis in terms of mortality and costs is probably much higher, although exact figures are lacking. However, if all of the pediatric deaths resulting from infectious diseases are considered in aggregate, sepsis is clearly the leading killer of children worldwide (see further discussion below) [4, 6].",

Nearly 100,000 children per year present to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) with severe sepsis [10], resulting in approximately 21,000 hospitalizations [11] and 4,500 deaths in the pediatric age group [5] on an annual basis.

However, more recent studies suggest that the pediatric sepsis is becoming more prevalent [9, 15]. For example, the prevalence of severe sepsis increased by more than 80 % between 1995 and 2000. Between 2000 and 2005, the prevalence of severe sepsis increased again by 45 %. The increase in sepsis is likely due in part to the increasing life expectancy of technology-dependent children and children with chronic medical conditions. Current estimates suggest that there are between 75,000 to 100,000 cases of severe sepsis in children in the United States every year, with an associated cost of $4.8 billion [10, 15]. While the overall case fatality rate has decreased (from 1995 to 2000, the case fatality rate decreased from 10.7 to 8.9 %), because there are more children affected now, the absolute number of deaths from sepsis has increased [15].",

In this group, neonates (i.e., infants less than 28 days of age) are particularly at risk for sepsis, with prematurity and low-birth weight being significant risk factors. Again, in the series reported by Watson and colleagues, low- (LBW) and very-low birth weight (VLBW) infants accounted for nearly one-fourth of all children with severe sepsis and approximately 70 % of all infants with severe sepsis in 1995 [5]. During infancy, chronic medical conditions \u2013 especially chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disorders, and malignancies \u2013 appear to be significant risk factors. The increase in sepsis cases also reflects the growing numbers of VLBW infants in the United States. The majority of infections causing severe sepsis in children are respiratory infections (accounting for about one third of all cases) and primary bacteremias (which account for approximately one quarter of all cases of sepsis in children). Bacteremia without an apparent focus appears to be more frequent in neonates and children with an underlying malignancy, whereas respiratory infections predominate in older children without underlying illness [5, 13, 14].",

Identified alterations include polymorphisms in TNF receptors, interleukin-1 receptors, Fc\u03b3-receptor, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Polymorphisms in cytokine genes may determine the concentrations of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines produced during sepsis and may influence whether persons have a marked hyper inflammatory or hypo inflammatory response to infection. Combinations of polymorphisms, or haplotypes, may ultimately be used to identify patients at high risk for the development of sepsis and organ dysfunction during infection and might dictate immune based therapy to modulate the response to a given patient.

The constellation of signs and symptoms associated with this syndrome included elevated temperature, tachycardia, tachypnea, abnormal peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count, and evidence of organ dysfunction. Shortly thereafter, an international group of experts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) convened to refine the definition of sepsis and proposed the now familiar definitions for SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock [29]. The need for a more pediatric-specific definition for SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock became clear quickly, and the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference was held in 2002 to develop these definitions (Tables 30.1, 30.2 and 30.3) [31]. Because tachycardia and tachypnea are common symptoms in a variety of pediatric conditions, the major difference in the definition of SIRS between children and adults is that the diagnosis of pediatric SIRS requires that temperature or leukocyte abnormalities are also present. In children less than 1 year of age, bradycardia may be a sign of SIRS and subsequently this condition is also included in the definition. Finally, the presence of fever is defined as >38.5 \u00b0C, which provides a more specific cut off than 38 \u00b0C. The definitions propose six age groups for age-specific vital sign and laboratory parameters: newborn (0\u20131 week), neonate (1 week to 1 month), infant (1 month to 1 year), toddler and preschool (2\u20135 years), school age child (6\u201312 years), and adolescent and young adult (13\u201318 years). These categories are based on expert opinion, since evidence based values for abnormal vital signs and laboratory markers are lacking [32]. As new insights develop, the definition of sepsis will also need to be re-evaluated.\n\n\n",

For example, Proulx and colleagues analyzed the incidence and outcome of SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock in a single tertiary care children\u2019s hospital [36]. Out of 1,058 admissions analyzed over a 1-year period, 82 % of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) met criteria for SIRS, while 23 % had sepsis, 4 % had severe sepsis, and 2 % had septic shock. The SIRS criteria also lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity outside the PICU environment, where early recognition and diagnosis are critically important. For many of these reasons, the \u201cPIRO\u201d concept [37] was proposed as a staging system for sepsis, modeled after the TNM (Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis) system [38] for staging malignancies. The PIRO staging system stratifies patients on the basis of their Predisposing conditions, the nature and extent of the insult (Infection), the nature and magnitude of the host Response, and the degree of concomitant Organ dysfunction (Table 30.4). The PIRO staging system has many favorable attributes, but will require thorough validation and testing before it is widely adopted and applied in clinical practice [39\u201341], particularly in pediatrics [42, 43].\n",

A suspected infection, as shown by positive findings at physical examination (e.g., signs of arthritis or osteomyelitis), petechial rash, or abnormalities on auscultation of the chest can therefore define sepsis. Laboratory evidence of infection such as the presence of white blood cells in a normally sterile body fluid or imaging techniques showing pulmonary infiltrates can also validate the suspicion of an infection. It should also be noted that in the definition of septic shock, there is no requirement for systemic hypotension, because children are often able to maintain their blood pressure at the expense of peripheral perfusion, even if they are severely ill.",

In addition, Graciano and colleagues recently developed and prospectively evaluated the Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (P-MODS) using a database of 6,456 consecutive admissions to the PICU at their tertiary care institution [47]. Finally, there are a number of disease-specific scoring systems that have been proposed for use in children with meningococcemia and septic shock [48\u201351]. Scoring systems such as these are important to link the severity of sepsis with measured outcome variables. Further information regarding these types of scores is provided in other chapters of this textbook. In addition, recent work by our group suggests that a pediatric sepsis biomarker risk profile (PERSEVERE) reliably identifies critically ill children at risk of death from septic shock. PERSEVERE, which is based upon five biomarkers performs better than any of the currently used severity of illness scores [52].",

Fever is frequently the initial manifestation of infection and is believed to result from the release of a number of the cytokines elicited in response to infection, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. Children, especially infants, may also present with hypothermia, which appears to be associated with worse outcome in adults with sepsis [55]. The mental status of a child with sepsis is frequently altered, ranging from agitation to obtundation. This depressed mental status can be present even in the absence of meningitis and reflects inadequate oxygen delivery to the central nervous system. The skin is frequently hypoperfused with decreased capillary refill and mottling. Petechiae and purpura are sometimes present and, while helpful in diagnosis, can be ominous signs. For example, petechiae classically points towards meningococcal sepsis, but can also be manifest in several other infections (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, enterovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella, etc.).",

Septic shock does not readily fall into any one of these four categories. Rather, septic shock is unique in that several of these forms may be present simultaneously in the same affected child. For example, a child with septic shock may exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with hypovolemic shock secondary to capillary leak, increased insensible losses, and decreased effective blood volume secondary to venodilation; cardiogenic shock secondary to the myocardial-depressant effects of bacterial toxins and inflammatory cytokines; and distributive shock from decreased systemic vascular resistance. The degree to which any one child manifests these physiologic perturbations varies considerably. For example, Ceneviva et al. [57] categorized 50 children with fluid-refractory septic shock based upon hemodynamic data obtained with the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter into one of three possible cardiovascular derangements \u2013 (i) a hyperdynamic state characterized by a high cardiac output (>5.5 L/min/m2 BSA) and low systemic vascular resistance (<800 dyn sec/cm5) (classically referred to as warm shock); (ii) a hypodynamic state characterized by low cardiac output (<3.3 L/min/m2 BSA) and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR); or (iii) a hypodynamic state characterized by low cardiac output and high SVR (>1,200 dyn sec-cm5) (classically referred to as cold shock). In stark contrast to adults in which the early stage of septic shock is most often (~90 %) characterized by a high cardiac output and low SVR (warm shock), most of the studied children (~60 % of cases) were in a hypodynamic state characterized by low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance (cold shock) and required the addition of inotropes and vasodilators to decrease SVR, increase CI, and improve peripheral perfusion [57]. Children with low cardiac output (as defined by a cardiac index less than 2.0 L/min/m2 BSA) had the highest risk of mortality. These findings have been confirmed in multiple studies using a variety of methods to measure cardiac output and vascular resistance [58\u201364]. Collectively, these studies all point to the fact that hypotension in children is a very late sign that portends a poor prognosis. Moreover, children more commonly present with cold shock, as opposed to warm shock.",

For example, the DAMP High mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) is involved in the progression of sepsis to septic shock [75, 98]. HMGB-1 is produced by macrophages or endothelial cells stimulated with LPS or TNF-\u03b1 and signals through TLR2, TLR4, and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) [99]. HMGB-1 results in cytokine production, activation of coagulation, and PMN recruitment [98, 100]. HMGB-1 mediates disruption of epithelial junctions within the gut via the induction of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI), leading to increased bacterial translocation [101]. Other specific DAMPs, including heat shock proteins (Hsps) and uric acid, may also stimulate TLRs, regulate PMN function, and function as immune adjuvants. Hsp are significantly elevated in septic adults and children [102]. Elevated Hsp60 and Hsp70 measured within 24 h of PICU admission was associated with pediatric septic shock and there was a strong trend towards a significant association with death [103, 104]. Cytokine production, PMN recruitment, and dendritic cell stimulation [105] are all increased following exposure to uric acid. In addition to its role as a pro-inflammatory DAMP, uric acid may also serve as an potentially beneficial antioxidant [106].",

Pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CXCL8 (IL-8), IL-12, IL-18, interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and TNF-\u03b1 are produced early in the host response and activate innate immune effector cells [107]. Compared to septic adults, septic neonates produce less IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12 [108\u2013113]. A wide variety of chemokines are increased during sepsis, including CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1a), and CXCL8 (IL-8) [114]. Other chemo-attractive molecules also increase with sepsis, including complement proteins C3a and C5a, antimicrobial proteins or peptides including cathelicidins and defensins, as well as components of invading bacteria themselves [107, 115]. The importance of chemo-attractive substances in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis is highlighted by recent studies showing that CXCL8 can be used a stratifying factor for survival in children [116], and C5a is implicated in sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in adults [75]. Chemokine investigations in septic neonates revealed that CXCL10 is a sensitive early marker of infection [114], and low CCL5 levels may predict development of DIC [117].",

The previously accepted host-response to sepsis paradigm (an intense pro-inflammatory response, or SIRS temporally followed by a compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome [CARS]) has been challenged by the failure of multiple anti-inflammatory strategies. New data demonstrate a simultaneous pro/anti-inflammatory response where the magnitude may determine outcome [119]. Near simultaneous increases in anti-inflammatory cytokine production (TGF-\u03b2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, and IL-13) occur during infection countering the actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines [107, 120, 121]. These mediators blunt the activation of phagocytic cells, block fever, modify coagulation factor expression, and decrease production of ROI/RNI, NO, and other vasoactive mediators [122\u2013126].\n\n",

Contrary to its name, the alternative pathway is actually the primary mechanism of amplification of complement activation following C3 convertase assembly (which cleaves C3 to C3a and C3b) formation via the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways. Dysregulation of complement activation may participate in the untoward effects with severe sepsis or septic shock.

These components serve to reduce bacterial load and include collectins (e.g., surfactant proteins A and D), lactoferrin, cathelicidin, bacteriocidal permeability increasing protein (BPI), and phospholipase A2 [141]. Acute phase reactant proteins including CRP (opsonin), lactoferrin (reduce available iron/antimicrobial peptide-lactoferricin), serum amyloid A (cellular recruitment), procalcitonin (unknown function), haptoglobin, fibronectin (opsonic function), pentraxin 3 (binds C1q and activates classical complement pathway) and others increase significantly during sepsis and provide useful adjuvant immune functions [107]. Natural antibodies (predominantly IgM) produced by circulating B1 lymphocytes augment opsonizing capacity [142\u2013144]. PMNs from term neonates are deficient in BPI, potentially contributing to the increased risk for infection [145]. Polymorphisms in BPI increase the risk for gram-negative sepsis in children [146]. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is capable of activating the lectin and alternative complement pathways, and decreased MBL levels are associated with an increased risk of sepsis during the first month of life [147, 148]. Despite increases in acute phase and other innate proteins with infection, neonatal plasma has significantly impaired opsonizing activity compared to adults that increases the likelihood of progression to systemic infection [149].",

Cytokine production increases expression of endothelial tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). PAI-1 inhibits fibrinolysis by inhibiting the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin important for the breakdown of fibrin. Deposition of fibrin in small vessels leads to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ failure [158].

Endothelial cells produce activating cytokines and chemokine gradients that recruit circulating PMNs to the site of infection. Expression of cell adhesion molecules by PMNs and endothelium allows cells to roll and extravasate into surrounding tissues. Activated PMNs phagocytose and kill pathogens via oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms. IL1\u03b2 is produced by activated PMNs largely via an NLRP3/ASC/CASP1-dependent mechanism that amplifies the recruitment of additional PMNs from the bone marrow to the site of infection [160]. Activated PMNs may release RNI, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and proteolytic enzymes extracellularly via activation of membrane associated-NADPH oxidase. These reactive intermediates and enzymes can lead to destruction of non-phagocytized bacteria but also can cause local tissue destruction [161, 162] and thus play a role in progression from sepsis to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). With PMN death, the DNA (chromatin), histone and antimicrobial proteins are expelled into the environment and serve to trap bacteria (neutrophil extracelluar traps, NETs) [163]. The formation of NETs can occur following activation of platelet TLR4 [164] and may lead to excessive local inflammation and tissue damage [165]. High early levels of circulating free neutrophil-derived DNA produced by NETs are associated with multiple organ failure, and death [166].",

DCs are \u201cprofessional APCs\u201d and are depleted from the spleen and lymph nodes with sepsis in animal models and may be important for survival [176]. Monocytes and macrophages are closely related to PMNs (common myeloid progenitor) and can kill pathogens by similar means. Circulating monocytes differentiate into macrophages following exposure to maturing cytokines and exit the blood stream into tissues.

            "text": "Recent studies have shown the critical importance of vascular endothelial activation in the early recognition and containment of microbial invasion. Expression of TLRs allows endothelium to become activated in the presence of microbial components, leading to production of cytokines and chemokine gradients, as well as adhesion molecules (VCAM, ICAM, L, P, and E-selectins, etc.). These substances all act in concert to attract circulating leukocytes and facilitate adherence [178\u2013182]. Vasoactive substances released from activated leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells include platelet-activating factor (PAF), thromboxane (TBX), leukotrienes (LTE), nitric oxide (NO), histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandins (PGE) [183, 184]. These substances are all necessary to attract immune cells (primarily PMNs) to the site of infection and to facilitate pathogen containment. Stimulated endothelium can be a double-edged sword, however, because excessive activation can lead to vascular dilation and leak which are a driving forces behind the severe consequences of septic shock [178, 185]. Systemic overproduction of cytokines and vasoactive substances including NO are associated with circulatory alterations and organ failure. The balance of NO and endothelin-1 (ET-1), which is a vasoconstrictor, may be disrupted with endothelial damage, favoring the constrictive effects of ET-1 leading to ischemia and injury [186]. This phenomenon may explain in part why NO inhibitors increased mortality in adults with septic shock [187]. Glucocorticoid receptor is the target for the endogenous, adrenally produced steroid corticosterone. Endothelial GR is a critical negative regulator of NO synthase expression and NF-\u03baB activation [188], demonstrating its role of endothelium in protecting the host during sepsis. Recent studies revealed a potential role of plasma angiopoietin protein during pediatric septic shock [189]. Angiopoietin-1 (protects against vascular leak) was reduced while angiopoietin-2 (promotes vascular permeability) was elevated highlighting a novel potential therapeutic opportunity to reduce end organ injury with pediatric septic shock.",

As discussed above, septic shock is really a composite of hypovolemic, cardiogenic, and distributive shock. Distributive shock is related to endothelial NO production that leads to excessive vasodilation. Cardiogenic shock may be related to mitochondrial death (induced by RNI and ROI) with subsequent myocardial dysfunction. In addition, some of the mediators released by the innate immune system are likely myocardial depressant factors [193]. Hypovolemia (absolute or relative) is very common. Peripheral vasoregulation abnormalities and myocardial dysfunction may play a larger role in hemodynamic derangements in pediatric patients, especially infants and neonates. Factors contributing to developmental differences in hemodynamic responses include altered structure and function of cardiomyocytes, limited ability to increase stroke volume and contractility, and contributions of the transition from fetal to neonatal circulation [65, 194\u2013197]. In adults, septic shock is most commonly characterized by reduced systemic vascular resistance and elevated cardiac index [198]. In children, as discussed above, reduced cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance is more common [57\u201364]. The hemodynamic presentation in neonates is much more variable [199] and complicated by an unclear association between a normal blood pressure and adequate systemic blood flow [200, 201]. Myocardial dysfunction can lead to ventricular wall stretch that in turn elevates brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). BNP levels have utility as prognostic indicators of mortality [202] in older patients with sepsis and in post-operative children [203].",

This phenomena is termed \u201cimmunoparalysis\u201d and is associated with reduced MHC class 2 expression and TNF-\u03b1 production by mononuclear cells following endotoxin stimulation. In addition to altered monocytic responses, there is significant loss of lymphoid CD4+ T and B cells via caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways [205, 206]. Whether by clonal selection, apoptosis, or elevated endogenous glucocorticoid levels [207\u2013209], lymphocyte loss may lead to a state of immune compromise following the acute phase of sepsis [207, 209\u2013214]. New data suggests that IL-7 may play an important role in promoting T-cell activation and the prevention of apoptosis [215]. The importance of immunoparalysis has been convincingly demonstrated in infected adults [216\u2013219] and children [204]. However, immunoparalysis following sepsis may not impact the preterm neonate in whom adaptive immune function is less well developed [220, 221].",

The role of vagal tone in the pediatric host response to sepsis is unclear. Discovery and characterization of the impact of epigenetic-mediated immune system functional alterations following sepsis is an area of intense research. DNA methylation as well as post-translational modification of histone proteins (methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation) may occur after sepsis [195, 223]. These DNA alterations may modify transcription factor access of gene-specific promoter regions ultimately leading to short and long-term changes in gene expression and immune function.",

In adult animals, B cells (and in particular B cell cytokine production) and not T cells were shown to be important in the early host response [225]. Interestingly, experimental data using neonatal mice lacking an adaptive immune system (RAG-1\u2212/\u2212) showed no difference in early polymicrobial sepsis survival as compared to wild-type animals with a present adaptive immune system [226].

Recent studies suggest that the mechanism of organ failure in sepsis may relate to decreased oxygen utilization associated with mitochondrial dysfunction rather than or in addition to poor oxygen delivery to tissues [242, 243]. Mitochondrial dysfunction can initiate activation of cell death pathways including apoptosis, pyroptosis, necrosis, and NETosis (i.e., cell death mediated by neutrophil extracelluar traps).

Plasma BPI concentrations in critically ill children with sepsis syndrome or organ system failure both had higher median plasma BPI concentrations than critically ill controls without sepsis or organ failure. Plasma BPI concentrations were also positively associated with pediatric risk of mortality score [140]. Free radicals play an important role in the inflammatory process of sepsis [244]. In a piglet neonatal sepsis model edaravone, a novel free radical scavenger, increased MAP and cardiac output, lowered heart rate, hydroperoxide, nitrite, and nitrate levels, delayed the TNF-alpha surge, prevented HMGB1 elevation, and was associated with longer survival times [245]. Elevated plasma nitrite/nitrates and increased organ failure scores are present in children with sepsis with an exaggerated proinflammatory state and a robust anti-inflammatory response [246]. Increased plasma nitrite and nitrate concentrations are associated with the development of multiple organ failure in pediatric sepsis [247].",

Elevated MMP8 mRNA expression and activity in septic shock correlates with decreased survival and increased organ failure in pediatric patients. MMP8 is a direct activator of NF-\u03baB [248]. Inhibition (genetic or pharmacologic) of MMP8 leads to improved survival and a blunted inflammatory profile in a murine model of sepsis. GWEP revealed zinc homeostasis as an important feature of pediatric sepsis [249\u2013251]. Prophylactic zinc supplementation reduced bacterial load and mortality in a murine model of peritoneal sepsis [252]. PBMC PPAR-\u03b1 gene expression is decreased with severe sepsis. PPAR-\u03b1 knockout mice exhibit a decreased inflammatory response and poor bacterial clearance in septic animals [253]. PPAR-\u03b3 exhibits altered expression and activity in PBMCs from children with septic shock [254]. Kruppel-like transcription factor 2 (KLF2) is a potent regulator of myeloid cell activation. Myeloid cell KLF2 expression is reduced with hypoxia and exposure to bacterial products, and a reduction of KLF2 is associated with increased NF-\u03baB mediated HIF-1\u03b1 transcription [255].",

Unfortunately, early recognition and diagnosis of sepsis, especially in children, remains a significant challenge, even in developed countries with advanced health care delivery systems [4, 256, 264]. Failure to recognize the signs and symptoms of sepsis and to institute timely and appropriate care leads to higher mortality rates in children and adults [54, 265\u2013271]. There are no simple, straightforward blood tests that can reliably diagnose patients with sepsis. While early evidence suggests that the biomarker procalcitonin is more sensitive than C-reactive protein (CRP) in detecting serious bacterial illness in children with fever [272], additional studies are required. The currently available test for procalcitonin is relatively inexpensive and readily available. Interleukin (IL)-27 may also be a more accurate biomarker compared to CRP, especially when used in conjunction with procalcitonin \u2013 though again further studies are required [273, 274]. Until these biomarkers are studied more extensively, sepsis will remain primarily a clinical diagnosis based upon the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms (i.e., SIRS) that occur with infection.",

Autopsy studies in adults have shown that the failure to diagnose and appropriately treat infections with antibiotics or surgical drainage is the most common avoidable error in the treatment of sepsis [278, 279]. Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of early source control (which may include surgical removal of the nidus of infection) and antibiotic administration. For example, Gaieski and colleagues showed that mortality significantly increased when antibiotics were delayed beyond 1 h in critically ill adults presenting to the ED with severe sepsis and septic shock [280]. A study by Kumar and colleagues showed that only 50 % of patients received antibiotics within 6 h of documented hypotension, which was associated with increased risk for mortality [267]. A protocolized approach to the management of sepsis has been shown to improve the time to administration of antibiotics in several studies involving both children [281\u2013283] and adults presenting to the ED [284\u2013289]. Indeed, this kind of approach has even been successful in resource-poor countries. For example, studies conducted in a rural population in India showed that home administration of oral and injectable antibiotics to neonates with perinatal-acquired sepsis resulted in significant reductions in sepsis-related neonatal mortality \u2013 sustained over a 10-year period [290, 291].",

Many of these children have had poor oral intake of fluid for a period of time prior to developing sepsis. With the development of increased vascular permeability, intravascular volume has been lost due to third spacing. Finally, peripheral vasodilation related to excessive NO production (see above) results in an abnormally increased vascular capacitance, decreasing the effective circulating volume. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with crystalloids or colloids is therefore essential to increase survival of septic shock in children. This goal can be reached by administering 20 mL/kg boluses over 5-10 min, repeated as necessary to achieve the hemodynamic goals stated in the preceding paragraph [305, 306]. Large fluid deficits are typically encountered, requiring 60 mL/kg volume resuscitation or occasionally much higher amounts [305]. Transfusion of packed red blood cells should be considered to maintain hemoglobin levels at levels consistent with adequate oxygen delivery, though the optimal hemoglobin for infants and children with septic shock is not currently known.",

There is perhaps one caveat, in that there is some preliminary data suggesting a mortality benefit with colloid compared to crystalloid in critically ill children with severe sepsis secondary to malaria [314, 315]. In recent years, several studies have shown a correlation between fluid overload and increased mortality in critically ill children requiring renal replacement therapy [316\u2013319]. Fluid overload has also been shown to correlate with impaired oxygenation, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and increased PICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), even in critically ill children who do not require renal replacement therapy [320]. Preliminary data from our group suggests that fluid overload is associated with worse outcomes in critically ill children with a low initial probability of mortality, but not in children with an intermediate-risk or high-risk of mortality (Wong, personal communication).",

In this prospective, randomized, controlled study, children presenting to the hospital (in Uganda, Kenya, or Tanzania) with a severe febrile illness received one of three treatments: 20\u201340 mL/kg 5 % albumin, 20\u201340 mL/kg 0.9 % saline, or no fluid bolus. There were no differences in mortality at 48 h between the saline (110/1,047 children, 10.5 %) and albumin (111/1,050 children, 10.6 %) groups, though mortality was lowest (76/1,044 children, 7.3 %) in the control group that did not receive a fluid bolus. These results were consistent across all sub-group analyses [321]. A follow-up analysis of these results showed that excess mortality occurred as a result of cardiovascular collapse and not fluid overload (pulmonary edema, neurologic deterioration, etc.) [322]. Given the accumulation of several decades of experience with intravenous fluid resuscitation, it would seem premature to abandon (or even temper) this therapy without additional data. In addition, it should be noted that the FEAST study and the majority of the aforementioned studies comparing crystalloid to colloid in children were performed in patient populations (e.g., dengue fever, severe malaria, severe malnutrition, etc.) that are quite different from the majority of critically ill children with shock in the developed world. Whether these findings can be generalized to different populations around the world remains an area of active study. In light of the remaining questions and available data, the usual practice in most PICUs is to initiate volume resuscitation with crystalloid fluids as a first line and follow with colloid if needed.",

            "text": "While the principles of hemodynamic monitoring and support have been discussed elsewhere in this textbook, a brief discussion here is justified. In the case of fluid refractory shock, inotropic or vasoactive support should be started without delay. Again, the most common hemodynamic derangements observed in critically ill children with septic shock are low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance (i.e., so-called cold shock). Dopamine has traditionally been the initial agent of choice for infants and children with septic shock [306], though the choice of additional agents will be determined by the clinical condition of the child. For example, dobutamine or epinephrine may be preferable in children with low cardiac output and poor peripheral perfusion (cold shock), especially given the association of dopamine with increased morbidity and mortality in several studies [323]. In addition, there have been some observational studies in both critically ill children and adults suggesting that dopamine may be associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality [324\u2013326]. Norepinephrine is the preferred agent for children with normal cardiac output and bounding peripheral pulses (warm shock). A type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as milrinone may also improve perfusion in children with cold shock, who are adequately volume resuscitated, though hypotension is always a risk with this agent. Regardless of the vasoactive regimen chosen, close monitoring of the oxygen delivery, as assessed by end-organ function, mixed venous oxygen saturation and a falling lactate levels, is necessary to tailor ongoing treatment. Finally, extracorporeal life support (ECLS) may be necessary and lifesaving in select patients [327\u2013332].",

Because of increased metabolic rate and poor nutrition, septic patients are frequently catabolic and at risk for the development of protein calorie malnutrition [333]. Intestinal ischemia in association with the loss of the mucosal barrier from malnutrition has been associated with translocation of bacteria and endotoxin from the intestine into the blood stream [334, 335]. Use of enteral feeding in critical illness has been shown to improve survival and decrease hospital stay [336]. The benefit of enteral feeding should be balanced with the risk of stressing the intestinal function in the face of poor splanchnic perfusion, especially in the presence of vasopressors such as epinephrine and norepinephrine [337, 338]. Regardless of the mode of feeding, adequate nutrition and nitrogen balance is important for maintaining adequate host immune function and achieving homeostasis. Malnutrition may adversely affect the immune function and the ability to have an appropriate immune response [339].

However, more recent data suggests that patients, who are critically ill, in persistent shock, requiring vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, might benefit from physiological doses of corticosteroids [341]. This finding has not been confirmed in other studies [342]. Some investigators have postulated that some patients with sepsis may have a relative adrenal insufficiency despite normal serum cortisol levels, because of desensitization of corticosteroid responsiveness [343, 344]. This has been shown in critically ill children with meningococcal sepsis [345] and in other forms of sepsis [343]. Unfortunately, there have been no randomized, controlled studies of corticosteroid replacement in critically ill children with severe sepsis or septic shock. The most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [300] recommend corticosteroids only if the patient remains refractory to vasoactive medications. In addition, use of the ACTH stimulation test to discern between relative and absolute adrenal insufficiency is not necessary. The pediatric version of these guidelines suggests starting stress-dose hydrocortisone (50\u2013100 mg/m2/day hydrocortisone) in critically ill children with fluid-refractory and catecholamine-resistant septic shock and suspected or proven absolute adrenal insufficiency (i.e., after appropriate diagnostic workup with a random/basal serum cortisol level followed by an ACTH stimulation test). The diagnosis and treatment of adrenal insufficiency is discussed in great detail in other chapters of this textbook.",
