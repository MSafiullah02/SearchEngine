And while communicable diseases are more significant burden of disease for poor countries they also pose major threats to health in rich countries.

Subsidies to farmers in rich countries for producing crops such as sugar beet, cotton and even tobacco can trap poor country producers in poverty, and consequently poor health.

Conditions and diseases of global health have a major impact on health and the burden of disease in both rich and poor countries as Markle et al. (2007) elaborate.

MDG 8, calling for a new global partnership is relevant to the determinants of global health, it sets targets for establishing fair trading and financial systems, meeting the UN target for aid first agreed in 1970, working with pharmaceutical companies to ensure access to affordable essential medicines and with private sector partners to make the benefits of new technologies including information and communications available to all.

This might appear straightforward when the objectives of cooperation are so clearly beneficial to all, but, as noted, the interests of states and other actors vary. Even in relation to global public goods for health, from which all benefit and none can be excluded as described in 10.1007/978-1-4614-5401-4_8, there is disagreement as to how responsibilities for action and funding are shared. States and other parties such as multinational companies may be happy to benefit from global public goods but unwilling to pay for them. Voluntary cooperation may be insufficient to address such factors, a system of global agreement between all the parties is required, preferably supported by some form of international law. Thus, for example, surveillance of threats to global health is clearly a global public good for health and after some years of negotiation the responsibilities of states were set out in law as International Health Regulations. However, this has not been the end of negotiations as, for example, in the case of influenza virus sharing by Indonesia (see 10.1007/978-1-4614-5401-4_6).",

It might be considered that any such agreement had to be ratified by the countries concerned before they can be considered relevant. Kates and Katz (2010) examine 50 significant international health agreements, classified as legally binding treaties and executive agreements and protocols, non-binding agreements and commitments to UN organisations, agencies and programmes plus declarations, principles, other international agreements and partnerships. Of these only 36 had been joined by the USA and only 8 of the 21 legal binding treaties had been ratified by the US Senate. Examples of such agreements include: the Millennium Development Goals, the Framework Convention on Tobacco control, the Doha declaration on Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement and Public Health and the Global Health Security Initiative. However, even when agreements are not legally binding or ratified they may still have moral force and the weight of international public opinion, as noted in 10.1007/978-1-4614-5401-4_7 and 10.1007/978-1-4614-5401-4_5.

Perhaps one reason for this is that health diplomacy is recognized by the Global Fund to be particularly important in fragile situations. Negotiations must recognize the differing cultural expectations and fears of participants in conflict situations to ensure safe access to services by local populations and safe passage for health workers whether from local communities or from external sources. Often such negotiations are even more complex because the participants may include parties in dispute and may involve local and international civil society organizations delivering health services alongside peacekeeping forces (whose role may not be acceptable to all participants).",

These start by addressing the interpretation of global health issues by different departments but often lead to a true cross sector approach with the engagement of business and civil society organizations. A similar broad cross sector approach to the determinants of global health can be seen in the EU\u2019s evolving approach to global health described in 10.1007/978-1-4614-5401-4_16.",

The WHO is clearly convinced of the importance of global health diplomacy to address the broader determinants of health Chan (2008). It also recognizes the importance of wider engagement with all sectors of society. The longstanding proposal for the creation of a forum for civil society organizations and other non-state actors alongside the World Health Assembly are discussed in 10.1007/978-1-4614-5401-4_18. While the proposal for a World Health Forum was abandoned by the WHO in November 2011 on the grounds of lack of support and finance, the need for such a wider forum remains valid and vital to the emergence of a new phase of governance for global health. This would provide the necessary response to the Copernican shift in our understanding of global health and its governance as set out in Chap. 23.",
