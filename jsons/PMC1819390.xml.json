            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) has been used to inhibit the replication of a wide range of viruses including the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), dengue virus, poliovirus, influenza virus A, coronaviruses, herpesviruses, and picornaviruses [1,2]. Due to its sequence specificity, RNAi is a potentially selective method for intracellular immunization against HIV-1 infection. RNAi-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication has been accomplished by synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in a transient manner [3-6] and by shRNA expression vectors in stably transfected cells [7-9]. Despite potent inhibition, the use of both approaches as therapeutic antiviral is limited because of the rapid emergence of HIV-1 escape mutants [9-11]. Strategies to reduce the chance of viral escape include the simultaneous use of multiple siRNAs [12,13], the intracellular expression of a second generation of escape-anticipating shRNAs [14], or microRNA-based double-stranded RNAs (miRNAs), which do not require perfect sequence complementarity for inhibition [15,16].",

These molecules should yield multiple effective siRNAs upon intracellular processing [6,17,18]. However, lhRNA approaches raise concerns about induction of the dsRNA-triggered interferon (IFN) response. Others and we have shown that endogenously expressed lhRNA and dsRNA can inhibit HIV-1 production without induction of the innate antiviral response [18-21]. In fact, most reports on IFN induction by long dsRNAs in mammalian cells are based on transfection of cells with in vitro synthesized dsRNAs [22,23]. Apparently, endogenously produced dsRNA is less active than exogenous dsRNA in inducing the IFN response.",

Transient expression of DNA constructs encoding virus-specific dsRNA in plant protoplasts or insect cells partially protects the cells from infection by the homologous virus [23,24]. Stable expression of such constructs renders the cells resistant to infection [25,26]. lhRNA can inhibit HIV-1 production under certain conditions, without induction of the IFN response [6,17,18]. Ideally, a single lhRNA should generate multiple effective siRNAs upon intracellular processing, providing more durable inhibition of HIV-1 than a single shRNA. An additional advantage of lhRNA inhibitors is that it does not require pre-determination of the optimal shRNAs and corresponding HIV-1 target sequences because multiple effective siRNAs will be produced. A potential disadvantage of the use of lhRNA as therapeutic is that the generation of multiple siRNAs will be more likely to cause off-target effects.",

An alternative for stable expression of shRNAs is a conditionally replicating HIV-1-based virus, which was previously used by us to deliver an antiviral shRNA cassette into HIV-1 susceptible target cells [27]. In the current study, we constructed the HIV-lhNef variant, which contains a 300 bp extended hairpin structure at the 3' genome position of the Nef gene of the otherwise wild-type HIV-1. We tested this HIV-lhNef for its capacity to inhibit the production of wild-type virus. Intriguingly, HIV-lhNef potently inhibited wild-type HIV-1 production in trans.

The hairpin structure is present in the full-length genomic RNA and all spliced mRNAs. This structure induced a severe virus production and replication defect. Similarly, we were not able to obtain stable expression of the lhRNA inhibitor from a lentiviral vector (results not shown), probably due to problems in reverse transcription of the excessively stable hairpin structure [29]. The presence of the lhNef insert resulted in a dramatic drop of the viral transduction titer, possibly also due to self-targeting of Nef/LTR sequences in the vector genome. Unlike the non-replicating lentiviral vector, the HIV-lhNef virus could generate spontaneous variants by evolution. Indeed, replicating virus variants could be selected with a severely truncated lhNef hairpin structure [28]. These escape variants are listed in Figure 1B, with the number of basepairs in the remaining hairpin structure in their name. For instance, AS44 has 44 remaining basepairs, producing a hairpin of intermediate stability (\u0394G = - 84.7 kcal/mol). We now set out to test these variants in further detail, e.g. for their ability to inhibit wild-type HIV-1 in trans.",

We measured CA-p24 in the culture supernatant as a measure of virus production 2 days post-transfection. Whereas wild-type HIV-1 produced high CA-p24 levels, no virus production was detected for HIV-lhNef (Fig. 2A, upper panel). This loss of virus production is due to the presence of the lhNef hairpin because no such effect was scored for several control constructs: HIV-1 with a CMV insertion in sense and antisense orientation (HIV-CMV and HIV-asCMV) and the Nef-deleted HIV-1 construct R1 (Fig. 2A). Notably, HIV-asCMV did not produce high CA-p24 values probably due to promoter interference from the strong CMV promoter. We next co-transfected equal amounts of wild-type HIV-1 with HIV-lhNef, HIV-CMV, HIV-asCMV or R1 (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Interestingly, only HIV-lhNef was able to potently inhibit wild-type HIV-1 production in trans. The level of inhibition is comparable to that obtained in a co-transfection with the highly effective shNef inhibitor [9], which we used as a positive control. We next titrated the HIV-lhNef construct to test if the inhibitory effect is concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B). We measured 92% inhibition of wild-type virus production when mixed 2:1 with the HIV-lhNef inhibitory construct. Even at a 7:1 ratio, HIV-1 production was reduced by 61%. The mechanism of this potent inhibition is currently unknown. Although HIV-lhNef may be a potently interfering construct, a major problem is that it does not replicate.",

A single PCR product was observed at day 58, indicating that HIV-1 predominated the culture and thus effectively outcompeted AS19. The same result was obtained when HIV-1 and AS19 were mixed in a 1:10 ratio (Fig. 5B). The competition results for all AS variants are summarized in Table 1 and shown in Additional file 1. The AS variants are likely to be less replication competent than wild-type HIV-1 due to the Nef-minus genotype, but the remnant hairpin structure may also impose a negative effect on the replication capacity. We therefore included the unrelated Nef-minus mutant R1 with a 106 nt deletion in Nef, but without a hairpin structure [9]. R1 produces CA-p24 levels comparable to wild-type HIV-1 and cannot inhibit viral production in trans (Fig. 2 and 4). We performed competition experiments between HIV-1 and R1, but also with AS19 and R1. HIV-1 also outcompetes the alternative Nef-minus R1 mutant (Fig. 5C).

In fact, all AS mutants outcompeted wild-type HIV-1, as illustrated for the AS19 variant (Fig. 6A). The results for all AS variants are summarized in Table 1 and shown in Additional files 1, 2 and 3. Intriguingly, variant R1 co-existed with the wild-type virus for 62 days (Fig. 6B). This result confirms that the Nef function is not important in T cell lines.

We therefore tested if HIV-lhNef could inhibit the Luc-Nef reporter, in which a 250 nt Nef target sequence was placed downstream of the Photinus luciferase gene [11]. As a positive control, we showed that HIV-lhNef induced a dramatic decrease of wild-type HIV-1 production in trans, comparable in efficiency with the highly effective RNAi-inducers shGag and shNef [13] (Fig. 7A). However, no sequence-specific inhibition of the Luc-Nef reporter was obtained with HIV-lhNef (Fig. 7B). The shGag molecule serves as a negative control in this experiment, and shNef as a potent positive control. In these transient transfection experiments a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid was included, which provides a control for transfection efficiency and possible aspecific effects. Renilla luciferase expression was similar in all transfections (results not shown), indicating that HIV-lhNef mediated inhibition of HIV-1 is specific and not due to non-specific effects, e.g. due to IFN induction by dsRNA.",

Moreover, HIV-lhNef may cause degradation of its own mRNA due to processing by the RNAi machinery. We postulate that the lhNef hairpin may induce an antiviral response against wild-type HIV-1 either through a sequence-specific RNAi mechanism or through aberrant HIV-1 transcripts lacking the 3' non-coding region and polyA tail that induce a potent HIV-1-specific RNA silencing response in cells. Tests with reporter constructs do not support a sequence-specific RNAi effect, although the effect induced by lhNef is HIV-1 specific. The mechanism of trans-inhibition is currently unknown, but it remains of interest to study the molecular details because the observed inhibition is extremely potent. We are currently dissecting the mechanism of inhibition by testing HIV-lhNef variants that lack important RNA signals (TAR, polyA, PAS, PBS, DIS, SD, psi).",

            "text": "Nef represents a pathogenicity factor that disorders adaptive immunity by down regulating CD4 and MHC-1 receptors, by inhibiting T-cell chemotaxis, and by inducing apoptosis in bystander T-cells, and hence plays a major role in the destruction of the host immune system [32,33]. It has been suggested that any therapeutic intervention aimed at either completely blocking or at least partially reducing the expression of Nef during HIV-1 infection would likely enhance the ability of the immune system to fight HIV infection [34]. Humans infected with Nef-defective HIV-1 strains show low viral loads and no or very slow disease progression and represent long-term non-progressors or long-term slow-progressors [31,35]. Moreover, macaques vaccinated with a SIV strain that only lacks Nef are better protected against superinfection than macaques vaccinated with a SIV strain lacking the three accessory genes Nef, Vpr and Vpx [36]. The cross-protection conferred by the attenuated SIV strains appears not to be based on stimulation of the adaptive immune system, but on other (unknown) mechanisms [37]. In this study, we demonstrate effective outgrowth of the Nef-minus AS escape variants in competitions with wild-type HIV-1. This result was obtained in the SupT1 T cell line, which does not provide a clear Nef-phenotype. We think that this outcompetition is related to the presence of the genomic hairpin structure, because no such effect was observed for the control Nef-deletion virus R1. These in vitro results may relate to the superior protection with Nef-deleted viruses in vivo.",

We previously described inhibition of HIV-1 replication by a conditional-live HIV-rtTA virus that expresses a shRNA against the Nef gene [27]. This approach is especially suitable for targeting cells that are susceptible to HIV-1 infection. However, HIV-1 escape variants will emerge rapidly under shNef pressure [9]. Expression of multiple shRNAs or a single lhRNA from such a vector could prevent viral escape because multiple precise mutations should occur. Use of a murine leukemia virus (MLV) can also be used for efficient and stable delivery of anti-HIV-1 shRNA [39]. However, MLV can replicate only in actively dividing cells, which limits its application as a therapeutic virus.",

The replication-competent AS escape variants lost the trans-inhibitory properties of HIV-lhNef, but effectively outcompeted wild-type HIV-1 in T cells. It is important to asses what is the minimum length of a hairpin that can mediate trans-inhibition of wild type HIV-1. We have previously shown that a 19 nt shRNA expressed from conditionally replicating HIV-1-based virus, can inhibit viral replication [27]. Any hairpin longer than that should in theory mediate trans-inhibition of HIV-1. Further research is needed to see if we can design constructs that are replication competent, yet remain a potent trans-inhibitor of HIV-1. For example, a lhRNA variant with G-U wobbles could be designed, which will destabilize the RNA structure and therefore stimulate viral replication. Such an approach using 90\u2013100 bp lhRNA molecules has been suggested as a means for intracellular immunisation against HBV and HCV, without evoking non-specific IFN responses [19,40]. Such constructs could form the basis for an attenuated virus vaccine and anti-HIV therapeutic virus in one.",

Transfections were performed with lipofectamine-2000 and 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells. Virus production was measured in the culture supernatant 2 days after transfection by CA-p24 ELISA and RL expression was measured with the Renilla luciferase assay system (Promega). We plotted the relative percentage of CA-p24/RL, with the transfection HIV + pBluescript set at 100%. Error bars represent the standard deviation from quadruple transfections in two independent experiments. (B) Trans-inhibition of HIV-1 production by the AS escape mutants. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with 150 ng HIV-1 and 150 ng pSuper-shNef, HIV-lhNef, the AS escape mutants or R1. CA-p24 production was measured in the culture supernatant at two days post-transfection. Error bars represent the standard deviation from quadruple transfections in two independent experiments.",
