Many of these are negative\u2010stranded RNA viruses, which originate in the nectarivorous and frugivorous mega\u2010bats of the tropics and subtropics (Filoviruses, Coronaviruses, Lyssaviruses, Henipaviruses (Chua et al. 2000; Leroy et al. 2005; Peel et al. 2012; Banyard et al. 2013). Despite the different host\u2013pathogen relationships in this group of viruses, they exhibit similar patterns of annual or interannual patterns of infection and spillover. Viral infections have been present in bats over evolutionary timescales, and bats have been historically sympatric with humans throughout Africa, Asia, and Australia. But the preponderance of emergence events have occurred within the last 20 years (Woolhouse et al. 2005; Woolhouse and Gaunt 2007). Outbreaks of Hendra virus in 1994, Nipah virus in 1998, Ebola virus in 2014 have been associated with significant landscape changes in the years prior (Bradshaw 2012; Pulliam et al. 2012; Bausch and Schwarz 2014), but limited data exist on how bat populations are influenced by such changes, making it difficult to ascertain the role of landscape change in bat\u2010borne disease emergence.",

            "text": "We use the tropical and subtropical fruit bat species of eastern Australia as an example of how a mechanistic link can be made between food resource phenology and bat population response in the context of Hendra virus disease ecology. Endemic to Australia, Hendra virus resides in its reservoir host, Pteropus fruit bats and periodically infects horses, and subsequently, humans (Halpin et al. 2000, 2011; Field et al. 2011). The emergence of Hendra virus is a good study system for questions about host population dynamics and disease emergence because: (1) Reliable data have been collected on viral prevalence, spillover events (transmission from reservoir host to secondary host such as livestock and humans), and host population distributions; and (2) Hendra virus\u2010fruit bat ecological dynamics can provide insights into other important bat\u2010borne viral zoonoses which have emerged in Africa and Asia. Since its emergence in 1994, Hendra virus spillover occurs sporadically and aseasonally in the tropics, but interannually during winter in the subtropics (Plowright et al. 2015). This curious pattern of Hendra virus spillover has been explored through spatiotemporal surveys of viral prevalence and seroprevalence in bats (Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011; Field et al. 2011, 2015b) and modeling studies of virus survival under different environmental conditions (Martin et al. 2015). Yet, the less explored host population dynamics can have a profound impact on the ecology underlying Hendra virus prevalence and spillover. Hypotheses proposed to explain pulses of infection in bat populations suggest that viral dynamics are intrinsically linked to fluctuations in bat populations (flux) or the food resources that drive these fluctuations, whether through population density effects on transmission, or environmental stress effects on viral excretion (Plowright et al. 2015). The precise manner in which fruit bat population density influences viral dynamics is uncertain, and models of bat population flux are necessary to understand observed patterns in viral prevalence or spillover.",

            "text": "The unique foraging behavior of fruit bat populations presents some challenges to modeling population dynamics. There are four species of Australian fruit bats: the little red flying fox (Pteropus scapulatus), the spectacled flying fox (P. conspiculatus), the black flying fox (P. alecto), and the gray\u2010headed flying fox (P. poliocephalus) (see Fig. S1 for distributions (Ratcliffe 1931). Hendra virus and anti\u2010Hendra virus antibodies have been detected in all four species; however, P. alecto is suspected to be the most important source of spillover (Daniels et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2014; Edson et al. 2015; Field et al. 2015b; Goldspink et al. 2015). Spatial distribution and behavior can be highly variable across species and individuals, ranging from sedentary to entirely migratory behavior (Eby 1991; Smith et al. 2011; Roberts et al. 2012b). Individuals typically forage within 20\u201330 km of their day roost, but have been observed traveling over 100 km in a night or many hundreds of kilometers within a few days (Roberts et al. 2012b). At the population level, movement among roosts can be continuous at low levels or involve the relocation of entire populations to a new roosting site depending on foraging conditions or disturbance (Eby et al. 1999; Shilton et al. 2008; Roberts et al. 2012b).",

            "text": "Fruit bat populations rapidly disperse and coalesce, redistributing large numbers of individuals across the landscape to forage on pollen, nectar, and capsular fruit of Myrtaceous trees, especially Eucalyptus and Corymbia (generally referred to as Eucalypts), Melaleuca, and Banksia (Courts 1998; Eby 1998, 2008; Birt 2004; Eby and Law 2008). Flexible population structure is manifested by low spatial cohesiveness and loosely defined social relationships, which can produce fission\u2010fusion type behavior (Aureli et al. 2008). Synchronized group movement occurs when environmental pressure, such as local resource depletion, migrating to unusually large pulses of nectar, or disturbances such as human aided dispersal and cyclones, reaches a threshold and precipitates a unanimous decision within and among groups (Eby et al. 1999; Conradt and Roper 2005; Shilton et al. 2008). As the majority of the fruit bat diet is comprised of pollen and nectar (Parry\u2010Jones and Augee 1991; Courts 1998), cycles of flowering and nectar production in Eucalypts drive a significant portion of bat population dynamics. Therefore, detecting phenological cycles in Eucalypts is necessary for building models of bat population flux.",

            "text": "A primary challenge is identifying variables that detect phenological cycles of flowering and nectar production across a landscape used by a population of bats. The Eucalypts of Australasia are broad\u2010leaf evergreens that undergo continuous cycles of growth and reproduction adapted for animal\u2010mediated pollination. Regional Eucalypt communities are often diverse, with unique responses to climate, which produce variable annual and interannual phenological cycles depending on the climate regime and species assemblage of the region (Law et al. 2000; Wilson 2003; Keatley and Hudson 2007). Remotely sensed reflectance and climate data that characterizes temporal changes in the local environment may enable detection of flowering and nectar production. However, to our knowledge, no studies have been published that directly link remotely sensed or climate data to nectar production. Fortunately, ample evidence in the literature provides sound basis for construction of proxy variables for flowering (Lindenmayer et al. 2015). For example, Eucalypt canopies experience a peak in leaf area during growth phases, which are then followed by decreased vegetative growth and initiation of the flowering process (Ashton 1975; Pook 1984; Pook et al. 1997). Changes in forest canopy structure and leaf physiology between these phenological cycles are discernible in remotely sensed spectral reflectance data and indices thereof (Coops et al. 1997; Datt 1998, 1999; Leuning et al. 2005; Ahl et al. 2006; Youngentob et al. 2012). Additionally, modeling studies show climatic factors, especially changes in temperature and precipitation in the months prior to flowering, are key predictors of the annual timing of flowering events (Keatley et al. 2002; Hudson et al. 2011a,b; Rawal et al. 2014a, 2015). Therefore, remotely sensed reflectance and climate data together serve as pertinent proxy variables for flowering and nectar production of Eucalypt forests.",

            "text": "Here, we develop a novel approach to predict bat population changes over time in response to food resource phenology. Previous research has analyzed trends in roost locations or zoonotic transmission events, within a presence\u2010only modeling framework, to identify the spatial distribution of bats and/or risk of disease transmission to humans (Peterson et al. 2004; Parsons et al. 2010; Hahn et al. 2014a,b; Pigott et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2014; Thanapongtharm et al. 2015). However, models of roost population abundance and occupancy remain unexplored, even though trends in abundance are important for understanding disease dynamics within bats and risk of transmission to humans. Models of roost occupancy are challenging because nectar pulses, which attract migratory bats, are driven by climatic conditions over various time lags (Keatley et al. 2002; Rawal et al. 2014a), and Eucalypt species assemblages are regionally diverse, so the timing and magnitude of nectar pulses is regionally unique (Keatley and Hudson 2007; Birtchnell and Gibson 2008). We address these challenges using proxies of nectar production that detect temporal patterns of general physiological states of Eucalypts (e.g., growth phases, bud formation, and flowering) to predict bat population flux. We develop a novel spatial sampling algorithm that relates bat population response to custom\u2010built proxies of nectar production and employ a statistical learning approach to identify optimal combinations of predictors. This study is part of a broader effort to characterize spatiotemporal bat population flux at the landscape scale and understand its relationship with viral prevalence and spillover.",

Estimated numbers of each species are recorded at \u201cfly\u2010out\u201d when bats are leaving the roost at dusk to forage. Census observations were recorded at approximately bimonthly intervals (with occasional irregularity) from 2005 to 2014 and display high variability, which appears qualitatively seasonal (Fig. 1). Three roosts were selected from the database located at Sandgate, Lowood, and Canungra (Fig. 1). These roosts were selected because they satisfied several criteria: (1) limited overlap within a 40 km foraging radius; (2) minimal interference from the migrations of the little red flying fox (P. scapulatus), which appear sporadically across SEQ in large nomadic groups of over 100,000; (3) sample sizes of census counts were large enough for rigorous cross\u2010validation; and (4) Hendra virus spillover events have been observed within their foraging radii. Based on similar foraging ecology, census counts of P. alecto and P. poliocephalus were combined to give the total bat population response used in our models.",

The sequence of Eucalypt leaf production, bud initiation, and anthesis is similar across species and produce changes in canopy structure, which can be detected via satellite imagery (Datt 1998, 1999; Leuning et al. 2005; Ahl et al. 2006; Youngentob et al. 2012). Reflectance data were acquired from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products MCD15A2, MCD43A4, MOD11A2, and MOD13A1, which were downloaded from NASA servers via the \u201cMODIS\u201d package in R at 8\u2010day intervals from 18 February 2000 to 22 September 2014 and processed to a spatial resolution of 500 m in Albers Equal Area Conic projection (Mattiuzzi 2014; R Core Team 2015). In addition to the commonly used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), several Eucalypt\u2010focused vegetation indices were constructed using the seven broad spectrum bi\u2010directionally adjusted Nadir BRDF reflectance bands from the MCD43A4 product. We based the Eucalypt\u2010focused indices on laboratory measurements performed by Datt (1998, 1999), which used narrow spectral bands measured from 118 Eucalypt leaf samples to identify indices of spectral reflectance wavelengths that were strongly correlated with chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, and water content. From Datt's work (1998, 1999), we identified four indices that use reflectance wavelengths within the range of the seven broad reflectance bands from the MCD43A4 MODIS product, which allowed the construction of spatial variables that closely approximate these indices (Fig. S2 and Table S1).",

Hence, climate data were structured to reflect climate extrema over relevant time lags. Raw climate data (daily rainfall and minimum and maximum temperature grids; Australian Bureau of Meteorology) were resampled using the nearest neighbor method to 500 m, matching the spatial resolution of the MODIS data. Precipitation values were summed over time, giving cumulative precipitation for the preceding 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months. Temperature anomaly values were calculated by comparing observed value of each grid cell for a given day to the mean value for the same day each year during the 14 year span of the data. Cumulative anomalies over multiple temporal intervals were calculated by adding all anomaly values for a grid cell for the preceding 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months.",

Bats are central place foragers, where they roost colonially and commute to foraging patches over a broad landscape (Elliott 1988). Although this type of foraging behavior facilitates population counts at roosts, the aspects of the environment that determine presence and abundance are found at foraging sites distributed across the surrounding landscape. A spatial sampling algorithm sampled the area surrounding a roost subject to spatial constraints based on previous knowledge of bat foraging behavior. First, sampling was restricted to areas containing preferred diet plant species of fruit bats (Eby and Law (2008), delineated by selecting polygons from regional ecosystem maps (produced by the Queensland Herbarium) that represent vegetation groups containing these diet species (Neldner 2004). Second, within the restricted sampling area, the weighted mean was taken using a spatial kernel representing the distribution of fruit bat foraging activity. The spatial kernel was defined by a Gompertz probability density function (using the \u201cflexsurv\u201d package in R; Jackson 2014) given by: f(x|a,b)=beaxe\u2212baeax\u22121\n",

The spatially weighted mean was calculated for rasters giving a time series with regular intervals for each spatial variable. The values at the time of census counts were calculated using linear interpolation between the two nearest time steps.

In the case of Canungra, occupancy can be predicted with only one parameter, ECARR_18mo (change in chlorophyll a reflectance ratio over 18 months). Overall, models predicting abundance included climate variables as well (Table 1). This is likely attributable to variable nectar production during flowering events; climate variables may be a better indicator of the magnitude of nectar production (Birtchnell and Gibson 2008).",

Specifically, Binomial models of roost occupancy show the four spillover events that occurred near Sandgate and Lowood occurred at times the two roosts were occupied (>1000 bats), but predicted to be unoccupied based on nectar\u2010based resources. Conversely, 7 of the 8 spillover events near Canungra occurred when models predicted high probability of occupancy. However, maximum population counts were higher at Canungra and presence of at least 1000 individuals was almost continuous. Models of population abundance predict a mean of 3020 bats at the time of observed spillover events, which is relatively low considering the large aggregations commonly observed with fruit bats (Eby 1991; Shilton et al. 2008; Roberts et al. 2012a).",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to accurately model the occurrence of fruit bats at day roosts and explain a significant portion of the variation in abundance over time. Previous work has modeled the spatial extent of bat habitat or potential areas where Hendra virus spillover could occur, based on bat roost locations, regardless of occupancy (Parsons et al. 2010; Hahn et al. 2014a,b; Smith et al. 2014; Thanapongtharm et al. 2015). Our methods show how models of bat population flux at the roost scale can be built, facilitating landscape\u2010scale spatiotemporal predictions of foraging suitability and bat population distribution. The success of our models (measured by their ability to classify occupancy with ~90% accuracy and explain ~50% of the variability of abundance) stems from a well\u2010informed suite of proxy variables, a sampling algorithm that relates predictors to population response in an ecologically relevant manner, and a statistical learning algorithm that identifies optimal predictor sets. Models relied most on time\u2010lagged changes of Eucalypt\u2010focused vegetation indices (which likely detect structural changes in the forest canopy as Eucalypts undergo phenological cycles of growth and flowering (Zhang et al. 2003; Ahl et al. 2006) and temperature extrema (which trigger synchronized flowering events within species; Moncur 1992; Rawal et al. 2015), indicating that temporal changes in bat population abundance at these roosts are largely driven by cycles of nectar production in the surrounding landscape. Comparison of spillover to models of occupancy and abundance suggests that (1) spillover near our study roosts occurred when nectar\u2010based resources are predicted to support relatively low population abundance, and (2) the relationship between spillover risk and population abundance may be heterogeneous across the region. This is the first time that spillover has been related to temporal trends in bat population flux driven by nectar foraging suitability, and given the limited data on spillover and high degree of stochasticity in bat disease ecology, further analyses are required.",

            "text": "General limitations of our study are worth consideration. First, our analysis focuses on three study roosts because they contain census time series with sufficient sample sizes for robust temporal cross\u2010validation, and spillover events have occurred within their foraging radii, allowing comparison of population flux and spillover. Although many other roosts are found in southeast Queensland, we expect that they exhibit similar seasonal patterns of occupancy based on their proximity to our study roosts. The observed patterns at the three roosts \u2013 spillover occurring in winter during low predicted population sizes \u2013 is corroborated by studies showing that viral excretion (Field et al. 2015b) and spillover (Plowright et al. 2015) in the subtropics are highest in winter, coincident with smaller winter population sizes (Nelson 1965; Eby 1991). Second, the set of variables which predict bat occurrence and abundance is unique between roosts. This is expected because the assemblage of Eucalypt species \u2013 each with a species\u2010specific flowering response to climate \u2013 surrounding each roost is unique (Keatley and Hudson 2007; Birtchnell and Gibson 2008), necessitating an individual model fitted to each roost data set. However, specific predictor\u2013response relationships at the roost scale do not preclude developing landscape\u2010scale models, as discussed below. Third, models detect the pattern of occupancy with high classification accuracy (86\u201393%); however, predicting bat abundance is more challenging, with 43\u201353% of the variation in the data accounted for. Given the overdispersion in the abundance data (due to variable population response and human error in estimating census counts) coupled with error/approximation associated with climate and remote sensing variables, accounting for half the variation in bat population response is noteworthy. It should also be noted that foraging behavior in P. alecto and P. poliocephalus is flexible. They primarily feed on nectar and pollen of Eucalypts (Parry\u2010Jones and Augee 1991; Courts 1998); however, when these are unavailable, they can remain at a roost by switching to non\u2010nectar\u2010based resources such as fruits of non\u2010native plants found in urban and peri\u2010urban landscapes (Eby 1998; Markus and Hall 2004; Fahr et al. 2015; Field et al. 2015a). The extent to which populations utilize, and are able to be supported by, urban and peri\u2010urban areas is unknown. However, generalist feeding behavior could explain occurrence or high abundance at times when models based on nectar phenology predict absence or low abundance. Furthermore, social drivers of colonial behavior in bats can lead to high peaks in abundance that are not necessarily driven by food abundance (nectar\u2010based or otherwise).",

            "text": "Our models provide an important observation related to the temporal relationship between pathogen spillover and bat population dynamics due to nectar foraging; that is, Hendra virus spillover in this region is likely not driven by large groups of migratory bats that feed on nectar and pollen of Eucalypts. Most Hendra virus spillover events occur in winter in southeast Queensland when our abundance models predict relatively low (mean of 3020) population sizes at roosts. Interpretation of spillover risk based on our models and data alone is speculative; however, they support the hypothesis that spillover may be associated with resident sedentary subpopulations that choose to remain in the roost and subsist on urban\u2010based resources when nectar availability is low (Plowright et al. 2015). General foraging behavior of fruit bats allows them to form sedentary populations in response to both seasonal changes in nectar availability and loss of foraging habitat. If winter population sizes approach or surpass the seasonal carrying capacity of the landscape, and food resources are limited, part of the population may also suffer from nutritional stress. Further, lower night time temperatures may increase caloric requirement and the cost of immune functioning (Hawley and Altizer 2011), facilitating winter nutritional stress, which Plowright et al. (2015) propose may lead to increased viral shedding. Although physiological stress is a recurrent theme in disease ecology (Hawley and Altizer 2011; Brearley et al. 2013; Hing et al. 2016) and has been observed in the Hendra virus disease system (Plowright et al. 2008), its role in Hendra virus spillover is difficult to determine without additional data on chronic or periodic states of stress in bats (McMichael et al. 2014). Alternatively, increased urban foraging in winter, leading to increased contact with horses, could be the only risk factor needed to drive spillover.",

Parry\u2010Jones and Augee (1991) observed remarkable variability in P. poliocephalus in the proportion of diet comprised of nectar and pollen of Eucalypts (28\u201386% depending on the year and season). Therefore, we hypothesize long\u2010term shifts toward a more urban\u2010based diet with less migration in bat foraging behavior as foraging habitat becomes fragmented and the cost of migrating for a nectar dominated diet increases. Dramatic landscape changes in southeast Queensland began to accelerate in the early 1990s (just prior to Hendra virus emergence in 1994 (Bradshaw 2012). Additionally, modeling studies suggest Eucalypts may respond to climate changes with increased asynchrony and decreased intensity of flowering events (Keatley et al. 2002; Hudson et al. 2009, 2011a; Butt et al. 2013; Rawal et al. 2013, 2014a,b, 2015). The combined effect of habitat fragmentation and climate changes may be decreased abundance, increased spatial heterogeneity, and increased asynchrony of nectar resources. Together, these processes may decrease the overall amount of energy available across the landscape and increase the energetic cost of a mobile foraging strategy based primarily on nectar resources (Calcagno et al. 2014). It is plausible that the past 25 years of landscape and climate changes in southeast Queensland have altered the ecological behavior of nectar\u2010seeking in fruit bats leading to supplementation with non\u2010nectar resources in peri\u2010urban areas, consequently diminishing the ability of models based on nectar resources to explain bat abundance.",

Techniques to estimate the distribution of nectar\u2010based resources are important, because they can inform about habitat loss over time, potential seasonal nectar shortages, and times and areas when bat populations are likely to rely more on urban\u2010based resources leading to increased risk of spillover. Expanding models to the landscape scale could be achieved with the same spatial sampling techniques to construct datasets for additional locations, but would use regression trees, which allow multiple predictor\u2013response relationships within datasets, thereby permitting prediction of nectar\u2010driven population density across space and time. This can direct better\u2010informed policy decisions concerning the conservation of bat foraging habitat, which has become a pressing question as humans and bats increasingly compete for habitat.",

Future work will enable identification of habitat areas of high conservation priority that consider the complexities of bat foraging ecology. These can be extended to other ecological systems where fruit bat populations are driven by food resource phenology, such as African fruit bats, which migrate among Miombo forests (Richter and Cumming 2006), and Asian fruit bats that follow the phenology of Durian fruit and petai bean (Epstein et al. 2009).
