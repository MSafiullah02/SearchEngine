The main foci have been on the public health effort to contain the spread of the virus, and the care of individuals with acute infection. We, in eating disorders, must have a broader brief. Not only must we help care for those sufferers who contract COVID-19, we must also address the impact \u2013psychological, financial and social - on those that do not. The peculiarities of COVID-19 and the reaction of the public and governments to it, have particular relevance for people living with an eating disorder and those who care for them.",

The negative emotional effects of \u201cquarantine\u201d [1] are likely to be accentuated for many anorexia nervosa sufferers who are already isolated both emotionally and physically. Impoverished interpersonal function will be more difficult to handle when severe \u201csocial distancing\u201d is in place. These concerns do not just apply to people with eating disorders. Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York, has said \u201cPeople are struggling with the emotions as much as they are struggling with the economics\u201d [2].",

There will no doubt be a plethora of research in the coming months and years documenting what impact COVID-19 will have on the eating disorder community from both a clinician and patient perspective. Before speculating on these potential risks and outcomes, it is worth learning from past similar outbreaks and, where indicated, applying these efforts to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Data involving patients suffering from MERS, SARS, influenza and Ebola [3] were unequivocal in high risk populations (both healthcare providers and patients alike) in revealing a relationship between the neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced, and the outbreak concerned. There are similarities between these past outbreaks and the COVID-19 pandemic in that such outbreaks resulted in an ever-increasing sense of foreboding and fear, as well as elevated feelings of anxiety and panic and symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. What seems to be even more concerning is that there is now evidence to suggest that these adverse cognitive and psychiatric sequelae may have long lasting effects on people at risk [3].",

However, there are some features that stand out and are deserving of our immediate attention. In the short term, the prevalence of COVID-19 will mean that standard treatment approaches should be re-considered. Should people who are undernourished and with cardio-vascular compromise, be admitted? Although there is some debate as to the medical risks associated with this before COVID-19, do these become more of a concern now? Will the number of admissions decrease during the pandemic? On the other hand, because of the fear of community transmission, would there be a feeling of safety with admission to an eating disorder programme, thus increasing admissions and placing an increased demand on such facilities.",

Because of physical distancing and the mantra around the globe of \u201cstaying at home\u201d the running of face to face programmes becomes at the least challenging. There is ample evidence of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) group programmes being conducted utilising video conferencing (telehealth) with good clinical efficacy [4]. However, their adaptation to half day and full day programmes have yet to be investigated. The extension of online and alternate methods of delivering care from brief guided self-help CBT ([e.g. [5]) to more comprehensive care is urgently needed.",

Studies have suggested that anorexia nervosa may accord a level of resilience to viral illness [6]. It is unclear why, but it could be that there are also non-biological effects, e.g. one explained by the social distancing experienced by people with this eating disorder. Notwithstanding this, if they do contract COVID-19 the effect is likely to be more profound than might be expected than for others of a similarly young age group.",

Both the short-term and long -term consequences of having both an eating disorder and COVID-19 simultaneously are unknown and with time this is likely to become more apparent. It is therefore important that we rapidly develop a repository of comments, protocols, case histories, pertinent literature reviews as well as empirical papers on this topic.
