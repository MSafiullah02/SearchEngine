            "text": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent problem in critically ill patients, and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Even though improved renal replacement therapy (RRT) techniques and enhanced knowledge of critical care have increased the survival of critically ill patients with AKI in recent decades [1], recent research still shows a mortality rate of 24% in the AKI population [2], with 19% of the critically ill AKI population requiring RRT [3]. More than half of critically ill patients have AKI, and mortality is worse with progressive AKI [4]. Over the last 2 decades, the optimal timing of RRT initiation and the role of early renal support have been widely discussed. Earlier retrospective and prospective studies revealed the survival benefits of early RRT initiation; however, since the AKIKI and ELAIN trials published in 2016, these survival benefits have become debatable. In recent years, several meta-analyses have been published, most of which investigated prospective or retrospective studies owing to the lack of large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and in these meta-analyses, a definitive conclusion regarding the optimal time of RRT initiation could not be drawn [5\u201311]. Conventional indications (refractory fluid overload, acidemia, hyperkalemia, and uremic complication) for RRT initiation are indisputable over several years. Moreover, bedside intensivists or consulting nephrologists often use conventional indications as well as the patient\u2019s clinical condition to make decisions regarding RRT initiation. Several meta-analyses included studies that did not use conventional indications as late criteria (most prospective trials) [12] or studies that were not based on the AKI population [13\u201315]. To the best of our knowledge, therefore, little is known regarding the safety of the watchful waiting strategy and conventional indications for initiating RRT in AKI patients without the emergent need for RRT initially. The safety concern involves the risk of exposing critically ill patients to AKI-related complications (severe fluid overload, uremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis). Furthermore, recent advancements in novel biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL], cystatin, calprotectin, and [insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7] \u00d7 [tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2]) may provide insights into AKI patient triage, accelerating AKI or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diagnosis and improving AKI prognosis and RRT prediction [16\u201322]. Moreover, biomarker-guided AKI intervention may lead to improved outcomes [23]. A higher NGAL level is now considered a marker of poor prognosis. According to Bagshaw et al., some severely critically ill patients are unlikely to benefit from early RRT, and several potential drawbacks should be considered, such as higher costs or unnecessary complications from dialysis [74]. Several studies in this field used plasma NGAL as their enrollment criterion. Nevertheless, no meta-analysis has discussed whether the early initiation of RRT has positive or negative effects in the high-risk AKI population with high plasma NGAL.",

Several studies that revealed positive [13] or negative [14, 29, 30] effects of early RRT initiation were not included in our meta-analysis. Early renal support has several hypothetical benefits: fluid balance maintenance, electrolyte and acid\u2013base homeostasis, early organ support despite renal function in patients with multiple organ failure, removal of cytokines, and balance of metabolic demand in high catabolism condition (sepsis) [40]. KDIGO guidelines suggest starting RRT emergently in the event of life-threatening conditions (hyperkalemia, metabolic acidemia, pulmonary edema, and uremic complications) considered the conventional indicators for RRT initiation [26]. The 2016 Acute Disease Quality Initiative XVII International Consensus Conference suggested a more personalized consideration, and that RRT should be started when the demand exceeds the total renal capacity [41]. Only two RCTs could demonstrate a significant benefit of early RRT initiation [12, 56]. Several limitations and possible confounders might need to be considered (detailed discussion in Additional file 2: Document S6).",

Other secondary outcomes were also examined, but an inclusive result was reported because of the relatively small sample size (Additional file 1: Table S10A, B and detailed discussion in Additional file 2: Document S8). Three of six RCTs in our sensitivity analysis used conventional criteria alone, and the others used a combination of non-renal recovery or AKI progression as the late RRT initiation criteria. In five RCTs, the time from enrollment in the study to RRT initiation varied in the late initiation group (median time ranging from 21 to 57 h) (Table 3). It is difficult to define the longest safe observation time for the watchful waiting strategy, but 1\u20133 days may be reasonable. We summarized different early and late RRT initiation criteria as well as the primary outcome of eight RCTs using conventional criteria as late criteria, and this information is provided in Additional file 7: Figure S5.",

The role of biomarkers in AKI patient risk prediction and triage was noted only in recent studies and was not addressed in earlier trials. In addition, the adequate prescribed dose of RRT was more standardized after the publication of KDIGO AKI guidelines [26]. For example, in an earlier study by Bouman et al. [28], the minimal prescribed continuous venovenous hemofiltration dose was 24 L/day, which may be inadequate, as indicated by later studies and international guidelines [26, 71, 73].
