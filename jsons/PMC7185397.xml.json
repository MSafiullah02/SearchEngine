The identification of causative agents in severe community-acquired LRTI is mandatory for efficient clinical monitoring and treatment as clinical signs are poor etiological indicators. Until recently, two laboratory approaches have been used: one to identify bacterial infections from various pulmonary samples such as sputum, endotracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage and one to identify respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal aspirates, using generally low sensitivity assays, such as viral culture or antigen detection.",

Several combinations of primers and probes are used by different manufacturers and commercial assays differ in their performances for each pathogen or group of pathogens [3,4]. Validation of the method is not easy since multiplexing may hamper the performance of amplification as compared to single PCR [5]. However, multiplex PCR have a better diagnostic yield for viruses than standard cell cultures with a specificity equal to or above 90% [6].",

The detection of urinary antigen of L. pneumophila serotype 1 is very useful in the diagnosis, but not sufficiently sensitive. In our study, one case of Legionellosis gave a negative result for urinary antigen testing but was positive by PCR on the LRT sample. Our comparative study of NPAs versus LRT samples highlights the clear superiority of pulmonary samples for the diagnosis of L. pneumophila infection, as five of the six L.pneumophila were detected only in pulmonary samples. This result is in accordance with other studies indicating that throat or nasopharyngeal swabs are not reliable for the molecular detection of Legionella [15]. Clinicians should be aware that the absence of detection of Legionella pneumophila by PCR on a nasopharyngeal specimen does not exclude Legionellosis and that PCR on a LRT sample should be performed for the definitive diagnosis.",

PCR-based techniques can be performed in a few hours and are much more sensitive than previous assays based on antigenic detection.
