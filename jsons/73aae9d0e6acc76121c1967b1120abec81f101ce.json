In this opinionated review, we underscore the crucial role of biosensing to handle with such situations. As a matter of fact, testing accelerates life-saving decisions on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in an early stage, and thereby, decelerating or even preventing the spread of such emerging infectious diseases. Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea. Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection. In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing. We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers. Finally, we outline our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic outbreaks.",

However, PCR tests are generally performed in centralized diagnostic services by highly skilled personnel and their results may take from 4 hours up to 3 days. Apart from this, PCR tests are prone to the following limiting factors: (i) Sampling error: Nasopharyngeal swab is suitably performed to take mucus from the ventilatory system; however, this may give rise to false negatives as optimal sampling moment is still ambiguous. (ii) Besides, as a sample preparation (including cell lysis and nucleic acid purification) for PCR analysis is required, not only the number of the tests but also the number of extraction kits is a limiting factor for ramping up COVID-19 testing. (\"Shortage of RNA extraction kits hampers efforts to ramp up COVID-19 coronavirus testing,\" 2020) (iii) Generally, PCR samples require specialized handling and transportation.",

(iv) Quality of reagents utilized by different PCR kit manufacturers may also affect consistency among results. (v) Standard PCR methods may lack of sensitivity, potentially giving rise to false negative results in COVID-19 patients with unapparent clinical symptoms. For patients in recovery, this resulted in the heatedly debated issue with the \"reinfection\", or more accurately \"re-detectable positive\" patients, as confirming tests with moresensitive methods delivered again positive results . (vi) Because of the nucleic acid amplification employed, special primers and probes for each target are necessary which limits PCR's flexibility of scaling up for other nucleic acids in an easy and rapid manner. (vii) This previous point could even be a problem for the same target since SARS-CoV-2 RNA is likely to undergo mutations (Kupferschmidt et al., 2020) . Therefore, sequencing of genetic material of the virus should be continuously monitored and confirmed to ensure accuracy of this method. In this regard, other biosensing technologies offer a complementary approach to standard PCR-based tests not only in terms of sensitivity, but also in terms of diagnostics and therapeutic decisions. Moreover, the biosensing community is actively working to improve portability, time and cost of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection (Nunez-Bajo et al., 2020) as well as to create easy-to-use PCR-based microfluidic devices with an integrated sample preparation (\"State funds the development of rapid tests for coronavirus,\" 2020). Interestingly, an international company envisions an alternative approach by detecting COVID-19 within the exhaled breath condensate using the combination of PCR and LFA technology since it is an airborne droplet infection (\"The detection of COVID-19 on the breath followed by PCR, 2020\". In contrast to PCR, isothermal amplification of genetic material (at constant temperature) enables to develop point-of-care devices for the rapid detection of nucleic acids. A remarkable example of an approved technology for COVID-19 determination is shown by the company Abbott, which delivers results in around 13 minutes (\"Abbott Launches Molecular Point-of-Care Test to Detect Novel Coronavirus in as Little as Five Minutes -Mar 27, 2020\").",

For this purpose, a promising and powerful tool is the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology, mainly employed in gene editing (Li et al., 2019; Zuo et al., 2017) . Thanks to its different CRISPR-associated (Cas) enzymes, that can be programmed by single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) or CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), CRISPR technology enables to target all types of nucleic acids for a wide range of various targets, including bacteria, viruses, microRNAs and cancer mutations, in a simple and easily scalable way (only by changing the target-specific sgRNA/crRNA) (Bruch et al., 2019b; Li et al., 2019) . Current CRISPR-tailored approaches are based on two different detection modes, binding-or cleavage-based, shown in Figure 2 . (Bruch et al., 2019c) . In cleavage-based approach, after the recognition event of the target gene of SARS-CoV-2, the Cas/crRNA complex gets activated and cleaves the surrounding labelled reporter RNAs (reRNA), resulting in a concentration-dependent signal change. For the binding-based CRISPR detection, a catalytically deactivated Cas/crRNA complex, specific to the target sequence of COVID-19, is immobilized on the sensor surface (for example, on a graphenebased field effect transistor as previously applied for detecting genetic mutations (Hajian et al., 2019) ).

In this regard, two amplificationfree biosensing systems using CRISPR technology have recently introduced: the CRISPR-Chip for electrical detection of genetic mutations using Cas9 (Hajian et al., 2019) and the electrochemical CRISPR-Biosensor for microRNA analysis employing Cas13a (Bruch et al., 2019a) . Both groups have announced their interest to extend their systems for an amplification-free on-site COVID-19 testing (\"Cardean Transistors TM Made Available to Companies and Government Agencies Willing To Build Handheld Coronavirus Detection Devices,\" 2020; \"Diagnostics with molecular scissors -is this also possible for on-site COVID-19 tests?,\" 2020). Besides, CRISPR-Biosensor's group would like to target two characteristic genome sequences (E gene and RdRP gene) of SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, using a multiplexed microfluidic chip. In principle, CRISPR-powered approaches allow for an easy adaptation to any nucleic acids and thus, can address potential mutations of SARS-CoV-2 in a timely manner. As another nucleic acid amplification-free approach, an optical biosensor combining plasmonic photothermal effect and localized surface plasmon resonance has been recently demonstrated to discriminate similar gene sequences with high analytical sensitivity (Qiu et al., 2020) .",

With this, it is possible to detect the presence of the novel coronavirus (via IgM) or to provide a history of past infections (via IgG) as these antibodies are much longer present in the blood (Vogel et al., 2020) . In this regard, LFAs, well-known as at-home pregnancy and ovulation tests, offer an equipment free, user-friendly and rapid platform for optical on-site testing and are the masterpiece of biosensing and nanotechnology, so far (Marquez and Morales-Narv\u00e1ez, 2019). Moreover, as LFA utilizes cellulose-based materials (such as paper), it is amenable to mass production at very low costs (Morales-Narv\u00e1ez et al., 2017). Hence, commercial LFAs targeting the aforementioned immunoglobulins even simultaneously have already been developed and approved around the world, including Australia, China, Germany, Singapore, South Korea and USA (Sheridan, 2020) . These devices are now a valuable tool to monitor the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection using a drop of human serum, plasma or even whole blood, offering qualitative results within 15 minutes at the point of care; for example, at home or primary care (Sheridan, 2020) . Interestingly, collective positive tests facilitated by LFAs could lead to spot herd immunity regions, thereby possibly abandoning lockdowns. Moreover, Germany is planning to issue \"immunity certificates\" allowing citizens with positive antibody tests to stop their lockdown early (Bienkov, 2020) . However, highly sensitive approaches enabling a quantitative testing are also demanded since the measurement of the virus-related immunoglobulin levels can be employed as diagnostic criteria for suspected cases with negative PCR results (\"Read Online-Handbook of COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment.pdf,\" 2020). In addition, determination of breadth and kinetics of immune responses can be meaningful to study non-severe cases of novel coronavirus, thereby forecasting infection outcome (Thevarajan et al., 2020) . Although, employment of serological tests to determine COVID-19 immunity is still under debate (Feuer, 2020; Mallapaty, 2020) , -likewise, the protection capability of face masks was cautiously discussed by WHO (Devlin and Campbell, 2020 ) -we believe that serological test will be a crucial tool to execute serosurveys (Stadlbauer et al., 2020) , thereby, offering relevant information to take measures aimed at ceasing lockdowns and getting back to common life gradually.",

Similarly, graphene-based field-effect transistors, enabling portable devices, have been engineered to determine COVID-19 viral load in clinical nasopharyngeal samples, using a specific antibody against its spike protein (Seo et al., 2020) . Viral load, which is conventionally determined using quantitative real-time PCR, is not only important to determine the severity of the infectious disease, but also to monitor viral dynamics in infected patients and a therapy response . Hence, viral load determination may help to facilitate decisions driven by personalized medicine, thereby, effective clinical procedures can be applied. Nevertheless, antibody-based approaches mainly suffer from their relatively slow (typically a few weeks) development when compared with nucleic acid tests against a new infection as well as from their timeconsuming and expensive production. Depending on the specificity of the employed antibodies, they may also suffer from false positives caused by potential cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses. Importantly, existing literature summarizes current commercialized technologies focused on COVID-19 diagnosis and compare their strengths and weaknesses (Mallapaty, 2020; Sheridan, 2020) .",

They are also valuable as a blueprint to formulate therapeutic procedures. The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, a top hospital in China with zero fatalities, recommends the surveillance of the following inflammatory response biomarkers for the SARS-CoV-2 infection: C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3. It is worth mentioning that low total number of lymphocytes at the onset of the disease is also an indicator of poor prognosis, whereas severe infections display a gradually decreased number of peripheral blood lymphocytes (\"Read Online-Handbook of COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment.pdf,\" 2020) . Hence, lymphocyte analysis is also an effective resource in this emerging infectious disease. The clinical relevance of some of these biomarkers are discussed in Table 1 . In this context, the biosensing community is urged to create affordable, rapid, sensitive and multiplexed systems amenable to mass production in order to detect these biomarkers simultaneously. Besides, biosensing devices incorporating artificial antibodies (such as molecularly imprinted polymers) or other innovative antibodies (ex., shark antibodies) (Matz and Dooley, 2019) would be of great value in emerging infectious disease diagnostics, since they are amenable to withstand harsh conditions during handling and delivery.
