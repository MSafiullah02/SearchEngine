Because of concerns for healthcare resources in initial US pandemic modeling and the experience within New York City and surrounding areas, the US Surgeon General and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued guidance to stop performing elective surgeries in the United States.3, 4, 5 This recommendation was based on concerns for the quantity of personal protective equipment (PPE) present within the United States. A recent report regarding the COVID-19 pandemic from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services showed that hospitals are experiencing increasing costs and decreasing revenues which threaten their financial viability. Hospitals have reported that ceasing elective procedures and other services has decreased revenues while their costs have increased as they prepare for a potential surge of patients. Many hospitals reported that their cash reserves are quickly depleting, which could disrupt ongoing hospital operations 6. As predictive models of the impact of COVID-19 on the United States continue to be refined with more data, the delivery of healthcare services outside of COVID-19 must be addressed.",

Their current projections show that April 11, 2020 will be the day with maximum resource utilization (ICU beds, ventilators) within the US. This model assumes that social distancing will be in place until the death rate from COVID-19 falls below 0.3/million people, or likely through the end of May. It also forecasted zero deaths in July and August from COVID-19 if appropriate measures, including mass screening, contact tracing, foreign national testing upon entry to the US, and quarantine of infected patients are put in place to guard against the reintroduction of COVID-19 from another state or country. Historical examples like the \u201c1918 Spanish Flu\u201d pandemic show that multiple waves of the viral diseases occurred over many months. In the 1918 pandemic, the highest mortality was in the second wave (fall) of 1918. The 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the 2009 H1N1 swine flu did not follow similar patterns as the earlier pandemic. Indeed, the evidence suggests that there is no predictable temporal patterns for major viral influenza pandemics.7\n",

While the traditional definition of a recession necessitates two quarters of economic downturn, many have already referred to the US as in a recession.8 A systematic review showed that economic downturn generally decreases the volume of most elective surgical procedures, although a few procedures increased in volume.9 One study reported that the rate of cancellations of total joint arthroplasties was increased during the last economic recession, and appeared to be related to unemployment and consumer confidence.10 Conversely, another study using the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample showed that the 2007 economic recession did not substantially influence growth trends in total hip and total knee arthroplasty. Importantly, the acute economic downturn could result in the loss of employer-provided healthcare insurance for 12 to 35 million people, with an increase of 11 to 13 million people enrolled in Medicaid, and the number of uninsured could increase to 40 million with bigger impacts in Medicaid non-expansion states.11 The economic downturn and associated volatility have the potential to meaningfully impact the volume of elective total joint arthroplasty procedures.",

As with the so-called practice of \u201ccherry-picking\u201d and \u201clemon-dropping\u201d of patients based on the case complexity and resource requirements, an analogous scenario exists with the payor mix. By the time elective surgeries are resumed, the medical system will be under considerable financial strain due to a several month hiatus of incoming revenue. As such, there will be enormous pressure to quickly ramp up surgical volume to meet both the financial needs of the institution as well as the medical needs of the large cohort of patients whose surgical procedures were put on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic. There could very well be a tendency to prioritize patients with straightforward cases who have minimal comorbidities and insurance plans with favorable reimbursement fees. Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with increased medical comorbidities can increase the risk of postoperative complications which can lead to increased costs to the medical system 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. It has also been shown that economically disadvantaged patients have lower function and quality of life before and after total joint arthroplasty 18\n,\n19 and experience higher risk for certain complications and use more resources after primary total joint arthroplasty when compared with non-economically disadvantaged patients 20. With this in mind, there is potential for a widening disparity of care for those who are most vulnerable and for the underserved to become even less served.21\n,\n22 It remains to be seen how the systems will address these potential disparities while striving for economic stability.",

One solution to this may be to utilize midlevel staff (i.e. physician assistants and nurse practioners) to help with the increased caseload and overall throughput in the hospital, and thereby facilitate attending surgeons\u2019 ability to continue with resident and fellow education. Also, to address the backlog of postponed surgeries and remain efficient, hospital systems may need to utilize multiple \u201cflip rooms\u201d rooms with extended hours into the evening and weekends.

Some institutions with capacity for testing have implemented preoperative testing for all preoperative patients.

It remains unknown for how long the IgG antibody response will persist, and whether it will confer long term immunity. Nonetheless, serologic testing for antibodies to the SARS-COV-2 virus is under development for clinical use. On April 1, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first commercial serologic test in the U.S. It is anticipated that there will be several commercial tests available in the near future. Antibody testing would provide a clearer understanding of the prevalence and fatality rate of the disease, since it could identify patients who had the virus even if they had mild or no symptoms. The widespread utilization of antibody testing may also have a large impact on the clinical care pathways for arthroplasty patients as it may have implications for an enhanced ability to segregate patients into known immune and non-immune categories (if the case for long-term immunity can be proven with IgG antibody detection).

Since SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified pathogen, there is no pre-existing immunity to it in the human community, and there is no definitive cure to treat the disease. This is problematic for all patients. However, the elderly, those with underlying chronic conditions, and those with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable. From the early experience with COVID-19 in China, it was reported in a recent JAMA article that those aged 70 to 79 years had an 8.0% case fatality rate (CFR), and in those aged 80 years and older the CFR was 14.8%. The CFR was notably elevated among those with preexisting comorbid conditions\u201410.5% for cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer 28. In a recent meta-analysis from China which evaluated 46,248 infected patients, it was noted that hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease were significant risk factors for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus to develop severe disease compared to patients who had non-severe disease 29. A recent study from Wuhan, China reported on 34 patients who were in the incubation period of infection with COVID-19 and were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgery. Postoperatively all 34 patients developed pneumonia, and 44.1% of the patients needed ICU care, and 20% of the patients died 30. This mortality rate is much higher than the reported overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% in COVID-19 patients without surgery 28. The authors also noted a shorter onset of severe symptoms in this group of post-surgical patients compared to other reports of non-surgical COVID-19 patients. Because of this and the overall significantly higher mortality rate, the authors hypothesized that surgery may accelerate and exacerbate disease progression of COVID-19 30. As such, it may be reasonable to initially restrict elective arthroplasty surgery to those patients without significant medical comorbidities during the early stages of resuming elective procedures when there will still be some degree of COVID-19 patients present in the hospital. This could minimize the risk of postoperative patients developing severe disease should they be exposed and infected with the Coronavirus. Analysis of US Medicare data reveals substantial regional variation in patients at the highest risk, and rates of arthroplasty resumption may concomitantly differ.31 As the census of COVID-19 patients begins to diminish, it may then be safe to re-introduce patients with more concerning comorbid diseases into the hospital setting to undergo elective surgical procedures in parallel pathways of care.",

This approach is attractive because an ambulatory surgery center located remote from a hospital might be better able to isolate and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in performing primary hip and knee replacement in the outpatient setting, with these procedures having been successfully performed during the past decade by a select group of surgeons and institutions with multidisciplinary care team coordination, standardized perioperative protocols, discharge planning, and careful patient selection 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. Multiple systematic reviews have reported that outpatient arthroplasty is safe and effective.47, 48, 49 In 2018, the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, Hip Society, Knee Society, and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons put forth a position statement supporting the notion that some primary hip and knee arthroplasties can be appropriately and safely performed in the outpatient setting with discharge on the day of surgery provided strict preoperative patient selection, standardized perioperative protocols, safe discharge plans, and sufficient practitioner and surgeon experience are maintained 50. The current COVID-19 pandemic may impel an increased utilization of outpatient surgery centers for primary total hip and knee arthroplasty surgery in appropriate patients in order to disencumber the strain currently placed on hospital systems managing patients with COVID-19 disease.",

Questions will arise as to how we as surgeons will meet this demand and maintain quality care and safety for our patients, as well as protect ourselves from COVID-19 exposure and from fatigue and surgical errors. Discussions are already occurring regarding increased operating room (OR) volumes with extended hours into the evening and weekends.51 Such an increased work burden will undoubtedly place additional stress on surgeons, anesthesia staff, residents, fellows, PAs, NPs, nurses, and surgical technicians which may lead to physical and mental fatigue as well a strain on their mental health and overall well-being. Fatigue has been described as both physical and mental weariness and has been shown to negatively impact surgeon performance 52. Recent literature has also described another component of fatigued performance known as \u201cdecision fatigue\u201d which describes a declining ability to repeatedly make critical decisions\u2014independent of physical or mental weariness 53. A 2003 study of surgical errors by Gawande et al. found that 16 percent of self-reported surgical errors at three teaching hospitals in Massachusetts were attributed to surgeon fatigue 54. A similar study among Harvard orthopaedic residents found that those functioning at a fatigued, sleep-deprived level demonstrated a mean 22 percent increased risk of medical errors attributable to fatigue 55. The number of cases being performed in a day along with the case order is also important. A recent study demonstrated that surgical case order is an independent risk factor for adverse events in arthroplasty procedures, with procedures performed later in the day having a higher risk for arthroplasty specific adverse events (but not for systematic adverse events). Significantly increased operative time, higher cost, and longer length of stay were noted for fourth or later arthroplasty cases (p<0.01) 56.",

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation had proposed a three-year extension of the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) alternative payment plan/bundle with new rules; the current CJR has been extended to March 31,2021; in addition, caps on expenditures were placed 30 days before and during the declared national emergency, and the Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances policy applied to CJR, MIPS, and ACO\u2019s.65\n,\n66 COVID-19 is a new disease affecting the population broadly with yet to be defined long term consequence for those who become ill, especially those of Medicare eligible age. The risk adjustments for CJR, Value Based Purchasing, the Readmission Reduction Program, and the hospital and surgeon specific cost measures are now hampered. The disease and its aftermath could arguably warrant a new hierarchical condition category (HCC) to be considered in federal performance measure risk models. Knowing its full impact may take time and clearly is going to be regionally disparate; temporarily lifting those measures and their financial impacts could avoid undue burdens on the hospitals of the regions hardest hit.",
