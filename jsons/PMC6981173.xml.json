Antibodies can be quantitatively measured by a variety of techniques including the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplex bead assays (MBAs). The latter allows the simultaneous detection of antibodies to multiple antigenic targets and has been utilized now for Plasmodium serology for over a decade8. Since the advent of Plasmodium-specific MBAs, numerous assay optimisation and implementation studies9\u201317, as well as epidemiological application studies18\u201321, have been published by various groups.",

Assays of any type require controls or standards to assess variability across runs or batches and to compare research studies, and with a broad panel of antigens in the MBA, it is potentially difficult to find standards for all targets being assayed. Recently, standardization using curves of known concentrations of total human IgG has been suggested, but this was problematic in showing insufficient reproducibility between operators13. Moreover, these do not allow for the assessment of antigen-specific responses which are important for quality control in assessing the stability of specific antibodies over time. In-house pools of hyperimmune sera are commonly employed for serological studies, and recently, a World Health Organization (WHO) reference Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) serological standard has been developed by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC)22. This standard has previously been tested in a MBA panel of 40 malarial and non-malarial antigens15.",

IgG antibody responses were successfully collected across 21 antigens (Table 1; 17 P. falciparum antigens, 2 non-P. falciparum Plasmodium antigens and 2 non-malarial antigens) using a multiplex bead assay (MBA; see methods and29). From all collected survey samples that were processed at the Haitian national laboratory, minor loss of field samples was found due to data management issues (e.g., incorrect barcodes due to accidental typing while scanning barcodes in the laboratory or no blood sample recorded/collected in the field) or loss of DBS between field collection and laboratory assessment (Table 2). Thus, the majority of samples provided data appropriate for analyses: 99.2% (5,956/6,006) for Survey 1; 99.6% (21,801/21,891) for Survey 2; and 99.3% (5,001/5,034) for Survey 3. Laboratory work involved 71 assay plates over five weeks for Survey 1; 257 plates over nine weeks for Survey 2; and 59 plates over four weeks for Survey 3. Together these represent 32,758 participant samples processed over an eighteen-week period. After removal of median fluorescence intensity (MFI) data across all analytes for samples with missing or high responses to the generic glutathione-S-transferase (GST, n = 659, 2.0%; Supplementary Fig. 1), 5,898 samples passed QC in Survey 1 (99.0% of those received at the laboratory); 21,234 samples in Survey 2 (97.4%); and 4,967 samples in Survey 3 (99.3%). Removal of single analytes\u2019 datapoints due to low bead counts accounted for additional minor loss of data (n = 455 observations, 0.07% of all observations). Following these QC checks, there were 673,624 unique IgG observations across the 21 included antigens (Table 2).",

Upon repetition, all 13 of these assay plates passed the QC check and provided useable serological data. When comparing 2 to 5 parameter logistic regression fits for standard curves values, the 5-parameter logistic regression fit showed the smallest sum of squared errors for the HP curve for the majority of antigens and plates (\u226588%; Supplementary Table 1) and thus was used for all standard curves for further analysis.

Inspection of the median and IQR of the y-inflection point was used to assess within and between survey variation in standard curves (Fig. 4). The median and length of the IQR of y-inflection points was similar for Survey 1 and Survey 2 for most antigens; except for a smaller recorded Survey 2 median for MSP2_CH150/9 (i.e., below the 25th percentile of Survey 1) as well as a larger Survey 2 IQR for PfMSP-119, MSP2_CH150/9, SBP1 and to a lesser extent MSP2_Dd2.

Laboratory antibody measurements were collected for 32,758 participant samples across three surveys in eighteen weeks. Results for only 0.2\u20130.5% of the participants for each of the three surveys had to be removed due to high GST responses (i.e., evidence for non-specific IgG binding). The data collected for the remaining participants represent 545,683 P. falciparum serological data points of which only 414 (0.08%) had to be removed due to well-specific errors such as low bead counts. The quality control to assess the inter-plate precision of the assay was based on a specifically created positive control standard of RDT positive Haitians with high titers of anti-Pf antibodies (Haitian hyperimmune sera pool: HP). The rationale for creation of the HP standard was that it would most accurately represent seroresponses of the Haitian populace to the locally circulating P. falciparum parasites. In addition, we included the WHO Pf 10/198 NIBSC reference standard on one plate per day to compare for consistency among days22. The MBA was implemented in this setting as a high-throughput tool enabling rapid turnaround of antibody measurements for malaria epidemiological surveys.",

Minor plate-to-plate variation in MFI values was observed during assay processing, and could have been caused by inter-technician variability, pipetting errors or fluctuations in laboratory temperatures and/or incubation time during assay processing. For this specific study, plate values that fell outside the mean +/\u22122 SD of responses in the third point of the HP standard curve (i.e., the third point in the six-point dilution series of the HP standard) for two out of three highly immunogenic targets were repeated as previously described by others16. Using multiple targets for this selection compared to one target avoids rejecting a plate due to well-specific errors such as low bead counts or pipetting errors. This multi-antigen methodology also allows for pragmatic selection of truly problematic assay plates, since comprehensive errors (i.e., adding wrong amounts of detection reagents, improper incubation time) would affect all antigens\u2019 MFI readings on the entire plate and decreased or elevated signals would be seen throughout the whole antigen panel.",

The median y-inflection points were similar for Survey 1 and Survey 2 for most antigens with narrow IQRs, and the length of the IQR for y-inflection points was generally highest in Survey 3. For four of the included targets, the standard curves revealed a loss of reactivity over time (MSP2_Dd2, MSP2_CH150/9, GEXP18 and SBP1). As beads were coupled in one batch at the start of Survey 1 to exclude variations between bead batches, the loss in reactivity may be explained by these antigens covalently bound to the microbeads as being less stable after long-term storage, or degradation or loss of binding capacity of the IgG antibodies in the HP standard. Therefore, comparison of results among the three surveys for these targets should be interpreted with caution and future use of these antigens would need to optimise storage and binding conditions.",

Here, we reported IgG antibody responses in this reference standard to 14 novel recombinant malarial antigens of which 12 showed robust responses (IgG against Hyp2 and HRP2 did not). Antibody responses to Pf-, Pv- and Pm-MSP-119 antigens were similar to those described when the reference standard was developed and tested on ELISA by showing high titers for the Pf- and Pm-MSP-119 targets, and negligible IgG against PvMSP-11922. By adding this WHO Pf 10/198 NIBSC standard to one plate per day alongside the newly developed hyperimmune pool of Haitian sera on every plate, we were able to confirm the presence or absence of trends over time in antigen-specific results. However, standard curves from this NIBSC standard pool were more variable between plates and surveys. This could partly be explained by the smaller sample size (i.e., less curves were run for the entire study), stability of the sera over time, or potentially this standard may be more sensitive to day-to-day variations in incubation times during assay processing.",

This assay allows for rapid assessment of the exposure history of populations which can directly inform malaria stratification and targeting of interventions. However, inter-plate variability was considerable for some of the newly described targets with lower immunogenicity. IgG antibodies to these targets are perhaps more sensitive to long-term storage, fluctuations in laboratory temperatures and/or incubation time during assay processing. Future work should focus on further optimisation of international assay standards and standardized quality assurance/quality control metrics for multiplex antibody detection assays.",

In 2017, malaria incidence in the Grand\u2019Anse department was estimated at 18.1 per 1,000 inhabitants while this was 0.6 per 1,000 in Artibonite (source: National Malaria Control Program, PNCM, Haiti). Survey design and enrollment procedures have been described elsewhere28. The number of participants providing a blood sample in each survey included, Survey 1: 6,006 participants, Survey 2: 21,891 and Survey 3: 5,034. In the former two surveys, finger-prick capillary blood was collected in microtubes (Safe-T-Fill Capillary Blood Collection Systems: EDTA, RAM Scientific Inc.) and pipetted on Whatman 903 cards (GE Healthcare) within 24 hours, whereas in the latter survey, blood was spotted directly onto the Whatman 903 cards at point-of-contact. In all surveys, cards were dried overnight and packed the next day in individual bags with silica gel. These dried blood spots (DBS) were kept at room temperature and were transported to the national laboratory (Laboratoire National de Sant\u00e9 Publique, LNSP) in Port-au-Prince once per week where they were stored at 4 \u00b0C until processed. Participants were also tested with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT, SD Bioline Malaria Antigen Pf.; 05FK50) and treated according to national guidelines if positive28.",

The approximate serum concentration is used to indicate the dilution factor throughout the remainder of this report. A 6-point titration curve of the Haitian hyperimmune sera was created in bulk, stored at 4 \u00b0C and used on each assay plate. The first point of this HP curve was a dilution of 1:100 and titrated by 5-fold, meaning the second point was 1:500 up to the sixth point at 312,500. The WHO Pf 10/198 NIBSC standard22 was eluted in 1.0 ml of dH20 (1:5 serum concentration, 100 units) and diluted further in Buffer B. As with the HP curve, a 6-point curve (starting at 1:50) of 5-fold dilutions was prepared in bulk for use throughout the whole study and stored at 4 \u00b0C. As samples and controls were diluted 1:2 into assay plates (see below), final starting concentrations for the first points of the titration curves were 1:200 (HP) and 1:100 (NIBSC) and remaining dilution points in titration curves followed accordingly. Unlike the HP curve, the NIBSC standard curve was only run on a single assay plate every day. In addition, two blanks (buffer B only) were run on each plate.",

Briefly, blood elution for each sample was completed by taking one 3 mm spot from the centre of a DBS and eluting overnight in 173 \u00b5l of buffer B to create a 1:100 serum dilution for each sample. Samples were sealed in holding plates for storage at 4 \u00b0C and tested within three weeks of blood elution. For the assay, a mixture of all bead regions was prepared by adding 6 \u00b5l per coupled bead region (62,500 beads/antigen/plate) in 5 ml of Buffer A (PBS containing 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.02% sodium azide) for each plate. The bead mixture was mixed using a serological pipette and 50 \u00b5l was added to each well of a 96-well BioPlex Pro plate (Bio-Rad). Plates were placed on handheld magnetic separators (Luminex Corporation) and washed two times with wash buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20). After removing plates from the separator, 50 \u00b5l of reagent mixture in Buffer A (1:500 biotinylated anti-human IgG, Southern Biotech; 1:625 biotinylated anti-human IgG4, Southern Biotech; and 1:200 Streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin, Invitrogen) was added to each well followed by 50 \u00b5l of eluted blood sample. Plates were incubated on a shaker overnight at room temperature at 600 rpm protected from light. The next day, plates were washed three times and 100 \u00b5l PBS was added to resuspend beads. Plates were shaken lightly for 30 minutes and read with the MAGPIX machine (Millipore) using Bio-Plex Manager MP (Bio-Rad) software with a target of 50 beads/antigen/well. Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was recorded for each sample and corrected for background reactivity by subtracting blank values on each plate (Buffer B only) by antigen (MFI corrected for background, hereafter: MFI).

Logistic regression was only fit if no more than one value of the standard curve was missing and at least one of the recorded MFI values was >4.61 (i.e., MFI 100 before log-transformation).
