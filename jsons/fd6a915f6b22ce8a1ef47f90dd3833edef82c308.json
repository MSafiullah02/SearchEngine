The 73 olfactory epithelium of OMP-H2B::mCherry/TRPM5-eGFP mice expressed nuclear mCherry 74 driven by the OMP promoter in the intermediate layer of the olfactory epithelium (Figures 1a), as 75 expected for the location of nuclei of mature OSNs (Farbman and Margolis, 1980). eGFP 76 expression driven by the TRPM5 promoter was found in MVCs, with cell bodies located mostly 77 in the apical layer of the epithelium (asterisks), and at lower expression levels in a subset of 78 OSNs double-labeled with mCherry (Figure 1a), consistent with earlier publications (Lin et al., 79 2008; Lin et al., 2007; Pyrski et al., 2017). 80 81 We proceeded to isolate cells from the main olfactory epithelium of OMP-82 H2B::mCherry/TRPM5-eGFP mice (see Methods, Figure 1b). Figure 1c shows two isolated 83 OSNs with differential expression of eGFP. Using flow cytometry we found that fluorescence 84 intensity of individual cells for mCherry and eGFP spanned several orders of magnitude (Figure 85 1d). We proceeded to sort three groups of cells: high mCherry-expressing cells with low and 86 high eGFP fluorescence (presumably mature OSNs, these cells are termed OSN_eGFP-and 87 OSN_eGFP+ cells respectively) and cells with low mCherry and high eGFP expression 88 (MVC_eGFP, presumably MVCs). Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed 89 that, as expected the OSN_eGFP-and OSN_eGFP+ cells have higher levels of OMP transcript 90 than MVC_eGFP cells (Figure 1e,i), and OSN_eGFP+ cells and MVC_eGFP cells have higher 91 levels of eGFP transcript compared to OSN_eGFP-cells (Figure 1e,ii). Furthermore, compared 92 to OSN_eGFP-cells both the MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP+ cells expressed higher levels 93 of TRPM5 transcript (Figure 1e,iii) and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT)(Figure 1e,iv), a 94 protein involved in acetylcholine neurotransmission that is expressed in MVCs (Ogura et al., 95 2011). The asterisks in Figure 1e denote significant differences tested with either t-test or 96 ranksum with p-values below the p-value of significance corrected for multiple comparisons 97 using the false discovery rate (pFDR)(Curran-Everett, 2000) (pFDR is 0.033 for OMP, 0.05 for 98 TRPM5, 0.05 for EGFP and 0.03 for ChAT, n=8 for OMP OSN_eGFP-, 4 for OMP 99 OSN_eGFP+ and 4 for MVC_eGFP cells). 100",

Frozen slides were allowed to thaw and dry, then immersed in 70% ethanol overnight at 554 4\u00b0C, and allowed to dry again completely.

Trpm5-B3 probes and OMP-B2 probes (0.4 pmol of each probe in 100 \u00b5l HCR 559 hybridization buffer per slide) were added, and slides were hybridized overnight at 37\u00b0C.

            "text": "viruses to the central nervous system. Specialized chemosensory epithelial cells that 28 express the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5) are 29 found throughout the airways and intestinal epithelium and are involved in responses to viral 30 infection. Herein we performed deep transcriptional profiling of olfactory epithelial cells sorted 31 by flow cytometry based on the expression of fluorescent protein markers for olfactory sensory 32 neurons and TRPM5. We find profuse expression of transcripts involved in inflammation, 33 immunity and viral infection in TRPM5-expressing microvillous cells and olfactory sensory 34 neurons. These cells express the Tmprss2 transcript that encodes for a serine protease that primes 35 the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein before entry into host cells. Our study provides new insights into 36 a potential role for TRPM5-expressing cells in viral infection of the olfactory epithelium. Self-reported loss of smell in a large fraction of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 Giacomelli et al., 2020; Parma et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020a; Yan et al., 2020b) raises the 40 question of how SARS-CoV-2 affects olfaction in a subset of patients. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 41 into cells is mediated by spike protein attachment to the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 followed by 42 spike protein priming by the serine protease TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Chemosensory 43 cells found in the airway (SCCs/brush cells) and intestinal epithelium (tuft cells) express the 44 transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 (TRPM5) and other elements 45 of the taste transduction pathway and have been implicated in immune and inflammatory 46 responses to bacterial, viral and parasitic infection (Luo et al., 2019; Maina et al., 2018; O'Leary 47 et al., 2019; Perniss et al., 2020; Rane et al., 2019; Saunders et al., 2014; Tizzano et al., 2010). In 48 the olfactory epithelium TRPM5 and other proteins involved in taste transduction are also 49 expressed in SCC-like microvillous cells (MVCs)(Genovese and Tizzano, 2018; Lin et al., 50 2008), which have been proposed to be involved in a protective response to high concentrations 51 of odorants (Fu et al., 2018; Lemons et al., 2017). The ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 are 52 expressed in support cells, stem cells, and MVCs (Brann et al., 2020; Fodoulian et al., 2020). 53 However, whether MVCs play a role in viral infection or viral infection defense of the olfactory 54 epithelium is unknown. 55 56 Herein, we performed transcriptional profiling of MVCs and a subset of olfactory sensory 57 neurons (OSNs) expressing eGFP under control of the TRPM5 promoter (OSN_eGFP+ 58 cells)(Lin et al., 2007; Lopez et al., 2014). In order to profile these low abundance cells we used 59 a modified version of Probe-Seq, which allows deep transcriptional profiling of specific cell types identified by fluorescent markers as the defining feature (Amamoto et al., 2019). We 61 crossed a mouse expressing mCherry in the nuclei of OSNs under control of the OMP promoter 62 (OMP-H2B::mCherry mice) with TRPM5-eGFP transgenic mice (Clapp et al., 2006) (OMP-63 H2B::mCherry/TRPM5-eGFP mice). We isolated cells from the olfactory epithelium and used 64 fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort MVC_eGFP cells (mCherry negative and 65 eGFP positive) and cells labeled by OMP-driven mCherry that did or did not express eGFP 66 (OSN_eGFP+ and OSN_eGFP-cells) followed by transcriptional profiling by RNA 4386 genes was significantly higher in MVC_eGFP cells compared to 170 OSN_eGFP-cells, and expression of 5630 genes was lower in MVC_eGFP cells (Figure 5 -171 figure supplement 1). Transcripts for 550 olfactory receptors were lower in MVC_eGFP cells 172 (Figure 5 -figure supplement 1), and no olfactory receptors were upregulated in MVC_eGFP 173 cells compared to OSN_eGFP-. Figure 5a shows expression levels for the transcripts with the 174 largest differences between MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP-cells. Six of the transcripts that 175 are within the top 10 upregulated genes found in MVC_eGFP cells compared to OSN_eGFP-176 cells (Figure 5a) are also found within the 10 top upregulated transcripts when OSN_eGFP+ cells 177 are compared to OSN_eGFP-cells (Figure 4a)(Adgrg6, Avil, Cd24a, eGFP, Espn and Trpm5). 178 TRPM5 and eEGFP were among the top 10 genes whose transcription was higher in 179 MVC_eGFP cells compared to OSN_eGFP-cells with 1471-fold and 75-fold differences 180 respectively. Interestingly, Pou2f3, a transcription factor important in differentiation of MVCs 181 (Yamaguchi et al., 2014; Yamashita et al., 2017), is found within the top 10 upregulated genes 182 found in MVC_eGFP cells compared to OSN_eGFP-(Figure 5a) and is also significantly higher 183 in OSN_eGFP+ cells compared to OSN_eGFP-cells (expression of 3068 genes which was significantly higher in MVC_eGFP cells 189 compared to OSN_eGFP+ cells, and expression of 4060 genes was lower in MVC_eGFP cells 190 (Figure 5 -figure supplement 2). Figure 5b shows expression levels for the genes that showed 191 the largest differences between MVC and OSN_eGFP+ cells. Among the 10 genes that are 192 highly expressed in OSN_eGFP+ cells compared to MVC_eGFP cells we find Pde4a, a gene 193 expressed in mature OSNs (Juilfs et al., 1997) (OMP is also significantly higher in OSN_eGFP+ 194 cells, but is not among the top 10 genes, Figure 5 -figure supplement 2). Interestingly, Hcn2, a 195 gene that encodes for a hyperpolarization-activated cAMP channel that has been postulated to 196 participate in OSN axon growth and glomerular innervation (Mobley et al., 2010), is found in the 197 top 10 upregulated OSN_eGFP+ genes. Finally, the gene encoding for the synaptic protein 198 Snap25 is found in the top 10 upregulated lists for both OSN_eGFP+ and OSN_eGFP-indicating 199 that both OSNs are involved in synaptic transmission (Figures 5a and b). 200 201",

            "text": "the differentially expressed olfactory receptors differed from receptors identified by 206 van der Linden et al. (van der Linden et al., 2018). Finally, we compared expression of 207 transcripts involved in taste transduction, canonical olfactory transduction, and non-canonical OSNs (Figure 4d). The non-canonical OSNs considered here included guanilyl-cyclase D Pyrski et al., 2018). Both OSN_eGFP+ and OSN_eGFP-expressed low levels of Cancna1a 211 encoding for Cav2.1 and Trpc2. OSN_eGFP-expressed higher levels of Trace amine-associated 212 receptors (Liberles, 2015) than OSN_eGFP+ cells. Both OSN_eGFP+ and OSN_eGFP-213 expressed transcripts for OMP, BBS1 and 2 and proteins involved in the canonical olfactory 214 transduction pathway, markers of canonical OSNs. 215 216 Gene ontology enrichment analysis reveals differences in chemosensory transduction and 217 synaptic vesicle function between the three groups of cells. Perusal of the top differences 218 between the three cell groups suggested that these are distinct chemosensory cell types found in 219 the olfactory epithelium. Both OSN_eGFP+ and OSN_eGFP-share expression of OSN-specific 220 transcripts, express distinct subsets of olfactory receptors and differ in expression of the activity-221 dependent transcript S100a5, and MVC_eGFP cells differ from both OSN groups in expression 222 of transcripts for synaptic transmission and for markers of mature OSNs and microvillous cells. 223 In order to perform a thorough analysis of the differences between these chemosensory cell 224 groups we performed an analysis of gene ontology (GO) enrichment for lists of genes related to 225 chemosensory perception. When compared with either OSN_eGFP+ or OSN_eGFP-we found 226 that MVC_eGFP cells were enriched for transcripts for the gene ontology list of sensory 227 perception of sweet/umami taste (GO:0050916 and GO:0050916) (Figure 5d, Figure 5 -figure 228 supplements 3,4) involving taste detection/transduction proteins that have been reported to be 229 expressed in MVCs (Genovese and Tizzano, 2018; Hegg et al., 2010): Gnat3, encoding for 230 gustducin, the G protein mediating sweet and umami taste transduction (McLaughlin et al., 1992), Itpr3, encoding for the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 3 and Tas1r3, encoding 232 for a gustducin-coupled receptor involved in umami and sweet taste (Damak et al., 2003; Zhang 233 et al., 2003). Interestingly, the GO lists for sensory perception of sweet/umami taste 234 (GO:0050916 and GO:0050917) and other lists for sensory and taste perception (GO:0050906, 235 GO:0050912) are enriched in OSN_eGFP+ cells compared to OSN_eGFP-cells (Figure 4e, figure supplement 3, including Gnat3, Itpr3, Tas1r3). Furthermore, gene ontology 237 analysis for OSN_eGFP+ cells compared to OSN_eGFP-cells finds decreased enrichment for 238 sensory perception of smell (GO:0007608) and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways 239 (GO:0007186) that include a large number of olfactory receptors and transcripts encoding for 240 proteins involved in peripheral olfaction such as Gfy, Omp, Pde1c and Pde4a (GO:0007608) and 241 Dgkg, Gng13, Itgb1, Nsg1 (GO:0007186). Finally, enrichment of gene ontology lists for synaptic 242 vesicle function were decreased for MVC_eGFP cells compared with either OSN_eGFP+ or 243 OSN_eGFP-cells (Figure 5c,d). Results of this gene ontology analysis of chemosensation and 244 synaptic vesicle function reinforces the finding that the three cell groups in this study are distinct 245 chemosensory cell types of the olfactory epithelium. OSN_eGFP+ cells are related to 246 MVC_eGFP cells because of expression of taste perception gene ontology, but differ from 247 MVC_eGFP cells in expression of olfactory receptors and transcripts related to synaptic function 248 as expected for an OSN. 249 250 Gene ontology analysis finds enrichment of lists of viral-related, inflammation and immune 251 transcripts in MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP+ cells. SCCs, tuft and brush cells have been 252 implicated in responses to bacterial and viral infection, immunity and inflammation (Luo et al., 253 al., 2014; Tizzano et al., 2010; Ualiyeva et al., 2020). The fact that MVCs are closely related to 255 these cells (Fu et al., 2018; Genovese and Tizzano, 2018; Ogura et al., 2011) lead us to search for 256 gene ontology enrichment related to bacterial and viral infection, immunity and inflammation for 257 MVC_eGFP cells. We found robust enrichment of these gene ontologies in MVC_eGFP cells 258 and OSN_eGFP+ cells (Figures 4e, 5c,d). Transcripts related to viral infection that were higher 259 in MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP+ cells compared to OSN_eGFP-cells (Figure 6) including 260 those involved in viral entry into host cells, viral transcription and regulation of viral 261 transcription, negative regulation of viral genome replication and negative regulation of viral 262 process (Figures 4e, 5c, Figure 6 -figure supplements 1-3). We also found gene ontology 263 enrichment in MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP+ cells compared to OSN_eGFP-cells for 264 defense response to bacterium (Figure 6 -figure supplements 1-3). 265 266 Importantly, we also find enrichment for transcript expression for immunity and inflammation 267 (Figures 4e, 5c,d and Figure 6 -figure supplements 1-3). Genes related to inflammation and 268 immunity that were higher in MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP+ cells compared to 269 OSN_eGFP-cells are shown in Figure 6 -figure supplements 4-7. Among these transcripts IL25 270 and its receptor Il17rb are enriched in both MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP+ cells. In SCCs, 271 brush cells and tuft cell generation of IL25 leads to a type 2 inflammation and stimulates 272 chemosensory cell expansion in a sequence of events that also involves cysteinyl leukotrienes 273 (Bankova et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2019; von Moltke et al., 2016). The presence of both Il25 and 274 Il17rb suggests an autocrine effect. Furthermore, both cell types displayed increased expression 275 of transcripts encoding for enzymes involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis such as Alox5, Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 that are found in brush cells in the airways (Bankova et al., 2018) and tuft cells transcriptional profiling of three chemosensory cells in the mouse olfactory 282 epithelium: MVC_eGFP cells and two types of OSNs: OSN_eGFP+ and OSN_eGFP-. We found 283 that while the transcriptome of each of these cell types is distinct they share common features 284 across groups. The two groups of OSNs share transcript expression for proteins expressed in 285 OSNs such as OMP, olfactory transduction proteins, and proteins involved in synaptic function. 286 Yet, they differ in olfactory receptor expression and OSN_eGFP+ express taste transduction 287 transcripts and other transcripts found in SCCs such as Il25 and Pou2f3. On the other hand, 288 MVC_eGFP cells express transcripts encoding for taste transduction proteins and other 289 transcripts found in SCCs such as Pou2f3 but they do not express transcripts for proteins 290 involved in olfactory transduction and synaptic function, and they do not express olfactory 291 receptors. Finally, we found that MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP+ cells express a substantial 292 number of transcripts involved in viral infection, inflammation and immunity. 293 294 Here we find that OSN_eGFP+ are OSNs expressing full-length TRPM5 in the adult mouse 295 (Figure 3). This raises the question why our results differ from Pyrski and co-workers who did 296 not find full-length TRPM5 in OSNs (Pyrski et al., 2017). Likely, this is due to differences in 297 environmental conditions that alter the number of OSNs expressing TRPM5 in the adult mouse 298 (Figure 2). Interestingly, consistent with our finding of TRPM5 expression in OSNs, analysis of 299 scRNA data in the literature indicates that there are 8 OSNs expressing TRPM5 among 3209 300 OSNs in the data set from Ziegler and co-workers (Ziegler et al., 2020) and 3 OSNs expressing 301 TRPM5 among 2113 OSNs in the data set from Wu and co-workers (Wu et al., 2018). Finally, (Figure 4a) suggesting that these cells express olfactory receptors that are not analysis revealed that MVC_eGFP cells (and OSN_eGFP+ cells to a lesser 307 extent) are enriched in viral-related transcripts compared to OSN_eGFP-(Figures 4e, 5c,d, and figure supplements 1-3). To infect cells, viruses must interact with host cell 309 membranes to trigger membrane fusion and viral entry. Membrane proteins at the surface of the 310 host cell are thus key elements promoting or preventing viral infection. Here we find that 311 transcripts for several membrane proteins and cell adhesion molecules involved in viral entry are 312 enriched in MVC_eGFP cells. Plscr1 encodes a phospholipid scramblase which has been shown 313 to promote herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry in human cervical or vaginal epithelial cells and 314 keratinocytes (Cheshenko et al., 2018), and hepatitis C virus entry into hepatocytes (Gong et al., 315 2011). In contrast with its role in viral entry, PLSCR1 impairs the replication of other types of 316 viruses in infected cells (influenza A virus (Luo et al., 2018), hepatitis B virus (Yang et al., 317 2012)). IFTM2 is another transmembrane protein that mediates viral entry. In contrast with 318 PLSCR1, IFTM2 inhibits viral entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, (Yu et al., 2015)), 319 hepatitis C virus (Narayana et al., 2015), influenza A H1N1 virus, West Nile virus, and dengue 320 virus (Brass et al., 2009). IFTM2 also inhibits viral replication (Brass et al., 2009) and protein 321 synthesis (Lee et al., 2018). Nectins are transmembrane glycoproteins and constitute cell surface 322 receptors for numerous viruses. There is wide evidence that HSV can enter host cells through 323 Nectin-1 dependent mechanisms, particularly for neuronal entry (Kopp et al., 2009; Petermann et 324 al., 2015; Sayers and Elliott, 2016; Shukla et al., 2012), and Nectin-4 appears essential for 325 measles virus epithelial entry (Noyce and Richardson, 2012; Singh et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2016). In addition to cell surface molecules, the mucus contains secreted proteins that confer 327 protection against viruses to the underlying cells. Glycoproteins are major constituents of mucus 328 and exhibit multiple pathogens binding-sites. We found the Ltf transcript in MVC_eGFP cells, 329 which encodes for lactotransferrin. Lactotransferrin is a globular glycoprotein widely represented 330 in the nasal mucus with anti-viral activity against Epstein-Barr virus (Zheng et al., 2014; Zheng 331 et al., 2012), HSV (Shestakov et al., 2012; Valimaa et al., 2009)) and Hepatitis C virus (developed numerous strategies to overcome barrier mechanisms to enter the cells. 335 After viral entry infected cells have other resources to fight against viral infection by disrupting 336 the production of new viral particles, limiting inflammation processes and activating innate 337 immune responses. For example, TRIM25 is an ubiquitin ligase that activates retinoic acid-338 inducible gene I (RIG-I) to promote the antiviral interferon response (Gack et al., 2007). 339 Furthermore, influenza A virus targets TRIM25 to evade recognition by the host cell (Gack et al., 340 2009). In addition, TRIM25 displays a nuclear role in restricting influenza A virus replication 341 (Meyerson et al., 2017). Zc3h12a, also known as MCPIP-1, inhibits hepatitis B and C virus 342 replication, reduces virus-induced inflammation (Li et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2014), and exerts 343 antiviral effects against influenza A virus (Dong et al., 2017). Finally, Pou2f3 also called Skn1a, 344 encodes for a key regulator for the generation of TRPM5-expressing cells in various epithelial 345 tissues (Yamashita et al., 2017). Pou2f3 transcript was increased in MVC_eGFP cells (and to a 346 lesser extent in OSN_eGFP+) compared to OSN_eGFP-. Skn1a/Pou2f3-deficient mice lack 347 intestinal tuft cells and have defective mucosal type 2 responses to helminth infection in the 348 intestine (Gerbe et al., 2016). Finally, both OSN_eGFP+ and MVC_eGFP cells express Il25, an interleukin that is involved in the inflammatory response of TRPM5-expressing epithelial of expression of virally relevant transcripts in MVC_eGFP cells complement 355 published studies on the role of MVC-related SCCs in viral infection. In the trachea, viral-356 associated formyl peptides activate SCCs to release acetylcholine and activate mucocilliary 357 clearance by ciliated cells (Perniss et al., 2020). This activation is mediated by the TRPM5 358 transduction pathway in the SCC and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the ciliated cell. In a 359 similar manner in the olfactory epithelium MVCs respond to ATP, which is involved in 360 activating mucociliary movement by releasing acetylcholine and activating adjacent 361 sustentacular cells through a muscarinic receptor (Fu et al., 2018). Therefore, viral infection 362 could result in activation of MVCs resulting in activation of mucociliary clearance by adjacent 363 sustentacular cells. In addition, in the anterior olfactory epithelium, where there is a higher 364 density of MVCs, mice exposed to mild odorous irritants exhibited a time-dependent increase in 365 apoptosis and a loss of mature OSNs without a significant increase in proliferation or 366 neurogenesis (Lemons et al., 2020). Therefore, activation of MVCs by viruses could lead to loss 367 of mature OSNs contributing to smell loss after viral infection. Interestingly, in the mouse distal 368 lung, where there is no expression of SCCs, there was de novo generation of SCCs after infection 369 with A/H1N1/PR/8 influenza virus (Rane et al., 2019) raising the question whether virus 370 exposure could alter MVC number in the olfactory epithelium. Finally, because we find high 371 expression of transcripts involved in Type 2 immune response in MVCs viral activation of these cells could result in activation of cytokine-induced inflammation by long-term horizontal basal 373 cells that activate type 1 immune responses within the olfactory epithelium (Chen et al., 2019). 374 375The olfactory epithelium provides direct viral access to the brain through the olfactory nerve. 376Whether this olfactory path constitutes route of entry for viruses to the brain is a matter of 377 intense discussion, especially because some viruses are postulated to be involved in 378 encephalopathy and neurodegenerative disorders(Dando et al., 2014; Doty, 2008). Our findings 379 that these TRPM5-bearing OSN_eGFP+ cells are enriched in virally-related genes suggests that 380 these cells may be involved in or prevention of viral entry into the brain (and these two 381 alternatives are not exclusive since they may be different for different viruses). On the one hand, 382we identified transcripts encoding for viral receptors in OSN_eGFP+ cells, suggesting that 383 viruses can enter these OSNs. If viral particles were to enter the OSNs they could reach the 384 olfactory bulb through anterograde transport along the olfactory nerve and from the olfactory 385 bulb, viruses can spread throughout the brain along the olfactory bulb-hippocampus route. On 386 the other hand, we found enrichment for transcripts encoding for proteins involved in limiting 387 viral infection and promoting immune and anti-inflammatory responses in OSNs_eGFP+ and 388MVC_eGFP cells. In this case, viral spread to the brain would be prevented. Finally, the 389 olfactory epithelium is innervated by the trigeminal nerve, and substance P immunostaining is 390 closely associated with subsets of MVCs(Lin et al., 2008). This raises the question whether an 391 interaction between MVCs and trigeminal nerve fibers could participate in local inflammation as392 found for SCCs (Saunders et al., 2014), and could modulate the entry of virus to the brain stem 393 through the trigeminal nerve. Future experiments are necessary to study the potential role of 394 Recently, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have focused their attention on 397 investigating SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of entry into cells. SARS-CoV-2 targets mainly cells of 398 the respiratory pathway where viral entry is mediated by ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 399 2020). Because numerous patients reported loss of smell (Giacomelli et al., 2020; Parma et al., 400 2020; Yan et al., 2020a; Yan et al., 2020b), researchers wondered about the mechanism for 401 SARS-CoV-2 infection of the olfactory epithelium. In our study, we found the Tmprss2 402 transcript was significantly increased in MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP+ compared to 403 OSN_eGFP-(Figure 6). We did not find Ace2 enrichment in these cells, but this may be due to 404 inefficiency in finding with RNAseq low abundance transcripts like Ace2 (Ziegler et al., 2020). 405 Transcriptional profiling of single cells in the olfactory epithelium from other laboratories found 406 expression of transcripts for both Tmprss2 and Ace2 in in sustentacular cells and stem cells, and 407 at lower levels in MVCs (Brann et al., 2020; Fodoulian et al., 2020). Viral infection of 408 sustentacular cells may explain loss of smell because these cells play a key role in supporting 409 olfactory function by providing glucose for the energy necessary for olfactory transduction in the 410 OSN cilia (Villar et al., 2017). Importantly, type I interferons, and to a lesser extent type II 411 interferons induced by response of the host to SARS-CoV-2, and infection by other viruses 412 inducing the interferon pathway increases Ace2 expression in the nasal epithelium (Ziegler et al., 413 2020). MVCs may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the olfactory epithelium because 414 these cells may participate in activating inflammation of the epithelium that elicits type 1 415 immune response (Chen et al., 2019). Finally, our finding of transcripts involved in viral entry, 416replication and defense in a subset of OSNs raises the question whether viruses enter the central 417 nervous system through the olfactory nerve(Bilinska et al., 2020). This is relevant to the potential long term effect of SARS-",

            "text": "Overview of the method for transcriptional profiling of low abundance cell populations. For 425 transcriptional profiling of TRPM5-bearing MVC_eGFP cells and OSN_eGFP+ cells that 426 constitute a small fraction of the cells in the epithelium, we used FACS to separate the cell 427 populations targeted for RNAseq (Amamoto et al., 2019). In our experiments, we isolated the 428 cells from mice that expressed fluorescent marker proteins appropriate for cell sorting. OSNs 429 were expressing mCherry under the control of OMP promoter. eGFP was expressed in MVCs 430 and a subset of OSNs (OSN_eGFP+ cells) under control of the TRPM5 promoter. 431 432 Generation of OMP-H2B::Cherry mice. A PacI cassette containing PacI-H2B::mCherry-pA 433PGK-puro-pA-PacI was inserted into an OMP gene-targeting vector (pPM9)(Mombaerts et  434   al., 1996), which replaces the OMP coding sequence with the PacI cassette and expresses a 435H2B::mCherry fusion protein. Animals are maintained in a mixed 129/B6 background. 436 437 Animals. Mice with TRPM5-driven eGFP expression (Clapp et al.,2006) were crossed with 438 OMP-H2B::Cherry mice. Both lines were maintained separately as homozygous and 439 backcrossed regularly. Experiments were performed on mice from the F1 generation cross of 440 TRPM5-eGFP and OMP-H2B::Cherry mice (OMP-H2B::mCherry/TRPM5-eGFP). PCR was 441 used to verify genotype of experimental mice for eGFP and mCherry expression. Both male and 442 female mice were used for experiments with ages ranging from 3-8 months. Estrous and cage 443 mate information was collected for all female mice in conjunction with experimental use. Mice 444 were housed in passive air exchange caging under a 12:12 light/dark cycle and were given food 445 and water ad libitum. Mice were housed in the National Institutes of Health approved Center for 446 were performed in compliance with University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus 448 Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 449Tissue dissociation of the olfactory epithelium. Following euthanasia via CO2 inhalation, the 451 olfactory epithelium was immediately removed from the nasal cavity and epithelial tissue was 452 separated from the bone in the turbinates. Care was taken not to include respiratory epithelium. 453The epithelium was dissociated enzymatically with Dispase II (2 mg/ml ) diluted in Ringer's 454 solution ( 145mM NaCl, 5mM KCL, 20mM HEPES, 1mM MgCL2, 1mM CaCl2, 1mM Ny-455 Pyruvate, 5mM Glucose) (~25 minutes at 37 0 C) followed by an incubation in a papain plus 456 Ca/Mg++ free Ringer's solution (Ca/Mg++ free Ringer's: 145mM NaCl, 5mM KCL, 20mM 457 HEPES, 1mM Ny-Pyruvate, 1mM EDTA , L-cysteine: 1mg L-cysteine /1.5mL Ca/Mg++ free 458 Ringer's, Papain:1-3ul/1mL Ca/Mg++ free Ringer's), for ~40-45 minutes at 37 0 C. Following 459 incubation, DNase I (Promega) at 0.05U/\u00b5l and RNAse free 10x Reaction buffer (1:20) were 460 added to solution and the tissue was gently triturated using a ~1mm opening pipette. Isolated 461 OSNs were collected from supernatants via centrifugation and resuspended in cell sorting 462 medium of 1x PBS (diluted from commercial 10x PBS, pH 7.4 ) and BrainPhys Neuronal 463 Medium (Stemcell Technologies). Initially, isolated cells were examined with a confocal 464 microscope to confirm efficacy of dissociation methods, and examine cell types and 465 fluorescence. For RNAseq, cells were strained through a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer and kept on ice until 466 sorted via flow cytometry. 467 468 Flow cytometry. Fluorescence activated cell sorting was performed in the collection filter. The 488nm laser was also used to detect light 473 scatter. The threshold was set at 3%. Gating was set to exclude doublets and optimized as cell 474 populations emerged based on fluorescent markers. Flow cytometry calibration beads for 475 AcGFP1/eGFP and mCherry (Takara, 632594, 632595) were used as fluorescence intensity 476 controls. Olfactory epithelium cell suspensions from wild type and OMP-H2B::Cherry mice or 477 TRPM5-eGFP mice were sorted as controls for auto fluorescence for eGFP and mCherry 478 populations respectively. Cells were sorted into RNAprotect Tissue Reagent (Qiagen). 479 RNA-extraction. Total RNA was extracted from sorted, pooled cells from each cell population 481 using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers recommended 482 protocol. 483 484 RT-qPCR. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to 485 assess and confirm identities of cell types from each of the sorted cell populations. Following 486 total RNA extraction, RT-qPCR was performed in the PCR core at University of Colorado 487 Anschutz Medical Campus for the following markers: OMP, TRPM5, eGFP and ChAT. Primers 488 and probes used for eGFP, TRPM5 and OMP were described in (Oshimoto et al., 2013). 489 Predesigned primers and probes for ChAT were purchased from Life Technologies. The mRNA 490 for these targets was measured by RT-qPCR using ABI QuantStudio 7 flex Sequence detector. 491 1\u00b5g total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the High Capacity c-DNA Reverse 492 Transcription kit (ABI-P/N 4368814). cDNA was diluted 1: 2 before PCR amplification. The TaqMan probes were 5'labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM). Real time PCR reactions 495 were carried out in MicroAmp optical tubes (PE ABI) in a 25 \u00b5l mix containing 8 % glycerol, 496 1X TaqMan buffer A ( 500 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 M EDTA, 600 nM passive 497 reference dye ROX, pH 8.3 at room temperature), 300 \u00b5M each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and 600 498 \u00b5M dUTP, 5.5 mM MgCl2, 1X primer-probe mix, 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA and 5 \u00b5l 499 template cDNA. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: Initiation was performed at 50 o C 500 for 2 min followed by activation of TaqGold at 95 o C for 10 min. Subsequently 40 cycles of 501 amplification were performed at 95 o C for 15 secs and 60 o C for 1 min. Experiments were 502 performed with duplicates for each data point. Each PCR run included the standard curve (10 503 fold serially diluted pooled cDNA from control and experimental samples), test samples, no-504 template and NORT controls. The standard curve was then used to calculate the relative 505 amounts of targets in test samples. Quantities of targets in test samples were normalized to the 506 corresponding 18s rRNA (PE ABI, P/N 4308310). 507 508 RNA sequencing and pre-processing. RNA quality control, library preparation, and sequencing 509 were performed at the University of Colorado Genomics and Microarray core. Extracted RNA 510 was used as the input for the Nugen Universal Plus mRNA-seq kit (Redwood City, CA) to build 511 stranded sequencing libraries. Indexed libraries were sequenced using an Illumina 512 NovaSEQ6000. Library preparation and sequencing was performed in two batches, separated by 513 gender. 11 female samples were sequenced with an average depth of 37.3 million +/-SD of 6.5 514 million read pairs, and 25 male samples were sequenced with an average depth of 34.Analysis. Transcript abundance was quantified from trimmed and filtered 521 FASTQ files using Salmon v1.2.1(Patro et al., 2017) and a customized Ensembl GRCm38 522 (release 99) transcriptome (Zerbino et al., 2018). A customized version of the transcriptome was 523 prepared by appending FASTA sequences of eGFP and mCherry to the GRCm38 FASTA file. 524 The corresponding gene transfer format (GTF) file was modified accordingly to incorporate the 525 new transcripts. Transcript abundance was summarized at the gene level using the TxImport 526 (Soneson et al., 2015) package in R. Differential gene expression was quantified using DESeq2 527 (Love et al., 2014) with default parameters after removing genes with an average count of < 5 528 reads in each group. Significance was determined by FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05. TopGO was 529 used for gene ontology analysis (Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2020). The input to TopGO was a list 530 of significant DEGs and a list of all detected genes in the dataset. Enrichment was calculated by 531 dividing the number of detected genes by the number of expected genes within each ontology of 532 the TopGO output. To make the bar graphs in Figures 4 and 5, enrichment scores of 533 downregulated GO terms were multiplied by -1 for visualization. Heatmap visualization was 534 performed using pHeatmap in R (Kolde, 2019). 535 536 TRPM5 exon coverage. To visualize exon coverage of Trpm5, trimmed and filtered FASTQ 537 files were mapped to the Ensembl GRCm38 (version 99) using STAR (params, version 538 above. Read coverage was summarized by Trpm5 exon using a combination of Samtools (for Fluorescence Microscopy and in situ. For euthanasia, mice were 544 anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (20-100 _g/g of body weight), perfused transcardially with 545 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PBS) followed by a PBS-buffered fixative (EMS 32% 546 Paraformaldehyde aqueous solution diluted to 4% with 1x PBS) . The nose was harvested and 547 postfixed for 12 h before being transferred for cryoprotection into PBS with 20% sucrose 548 overnight. The olfactory epithelium was cryosectioned coronally into 16 \u00b5m -thick sections 549 mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (VWR, West Chester, PA). 550 551 In situ.
