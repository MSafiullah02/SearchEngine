            "text": "\"If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day I'm not going to let it stop me from partying,\" declared Brady Sluder, a college student celebrating spring break in Miami. My social media feed has exploded with chastisements of young adults who are ignoring public health advice advocating for social distancing. In particular, I hear these concerns from my retired parents and older neighbors, who worry that their own health will be sacrificed because of the recklessness of young adults. As a physician specializing in adolescent and young adult medicine, I believe that young people are actually in the best position to weather this period of distant socializing because of their fluency with technology as core to their social networking and engagement. However, some young adults may not be listening to public health advice because we are not effectively communicating in ways that resonate with them.",

Young adults are still developing the ability to set long-term goals and delay gratification. While teenagers get a bad rap, young adults actually engage in more risk behaviors than teenagers. For instance, young adults have higher rates of substance use and sexually transmitted infections than adolescents [2] . Missing a much-anticipated spring break trip with friends may seem worse than catching a virus.",

The young person is allowed to analyze the potential risks and benefits that are associated with their behaviors, thus supporting them to make their own informed choices [6] . 3. Privacy. Give young adults some privacy while home. Physicians now caring for young people via telehealth face challenges with providing confidential services when family members are in close proximity. If possible, allowing a young person some private time at home to talk with friends or romantic partners may prevent them from having to physically leave the home to get private time. Parents might allow their young adults more leeway to keep in touch with their friends and peers virtually so they do not have to meet in person. 4. Strengths. Young adults have many strengths, and leveraging these may be a win-win for all involved. Young adults are experts at distant socializing through social media and virtual communications. For instance, they can help families to keep www.jahonline.org connected virtually and troubleshoot technical issues as families work from home. Young adults can also assist with essential groceries for their families and older neighbors. Similarly, undergraduate and medical students have organized fundraisers and drives for personal protective equipment collection to support local hospitals.",
