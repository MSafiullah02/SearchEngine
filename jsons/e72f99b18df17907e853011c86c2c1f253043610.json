The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing day by day. Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing can be deployed very effectively to track the disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policy to manage its spread. This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This has been deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens. Finally, we propose a set of research opportunities and setup grounds for further practical applications.",

The cumulative incidence of the causitive virus (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly increasing and has affected 196 countries and territories with USA, Spain, Italy, U.K. and France being the most affected [2] . World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, while the virus continues to spread [3] . As on 4 May 2020, a total of 3,581,884 confirmed positive cases have been reported leading to 248,558 deaths [2] . The major difference between the pandemic caused by CoV-2 and related viruses, like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), is the ability of CoV-2 to spread rapidly through human contact and leave nearly 20% infected subjects as symptom-less carriers [4] . Moreover, various studies reported that the disease caused by CoV-2 is more dangerous for people with weak immune system. The elderly people and patients with life threatening diseases like cancer, diabetes, neurological conditions, coronary heart disease and HIV/AIDS are more vulnerable to severe effects of COVID-19 [5] . In the absence of any curative drug, the only solution is to slow down the spread by exercising \"social distancing\" to block the chain of spread of the virus. This behavior of CoV-2 requires developing robust mathematical basis for tracking its spread and automation of the tracking tools for on line dynamic decision making.",

We also provide a detailed comparison with a baseline model and show how catastrophic the effects can be if poorly fitting models are used. We present a prediction scheme based on the ML model, which can be used in remote cloud nodes for real-time prediction allowing governments and citizens to respond proactively.

Population density, average and median age, weather conditions, health facilities etc. are also to be integrated for enhancing the accuracy of the predictions. For this case study, we used three instances of single core Azure B1s virtual machines with 1-GiB RAM, SSD Storage and 64-bit Microsoft Windows Server 2016 4 . We used the HealthFog [12] framework leveraging the FogBus [14] for deploying multiple analysis tasks in an ensemble learning fashion to predict various metrics, like the number of anticipated facilities to manage patients and the hospitals. We analyzed that the cost of tracking patients on a daily basis, amortized CPU consumption and Cloud execution is 37% and only 1.2 USD per day.

In recent study by Data-Driven Innovation Laboratory, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) 5 , the regression curves were drawn using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model [25] and Gaussian distribution was deployed to estimate the number of cases with time. However, in the previously reported studies on the earlier version of the virus, namely SARA-CoV-1, the data was reported to follow Generalized Inverse Weibull (GIW) Distribution [26] better than Gaussian as shown in Figure 2 (details of Robust Weibull fitting follow in the next section).

This can be done using the popular Machine Learning technique of Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) for curve fitting [27] . However, as various sources have suggested, in initial stages of COVID-19 the data has many outliers and noise. This makes it hard to accurately predict the number of cases. Thus, we propose an iterative weighting strategy and call our fitting technique \"Robust Fitting\". A diagrammatic representation of the iterative weighting process is shown in Figure 3 . The main idea is as follows. We maintain weights for all data points ( ) in every iteration ( , starting from 0) as . First, we fit a curve using the LM technique with weights of all data points as 1, thus 0 = 1 \u2200 . Second, we find the weight corresponding to every point for the next iteration ( +1 )) as:",

The results are shown in Table 1 . We observe that using the iteratively weighted approach, the Inverse Weibull function fits the best to the COVID-19 dataset, as compared to the iterative versions of Gaussian, Beta (4-parameter), Fisher-Tippet (Extreme Value distribution), and Log Normal functions. When applied to the same dataset, Iterative Weibull showed an average MAPE of 12% lower than non-iteratively weighted Weibull.

Using the proposed Robust Weibull model based on iterative weighting, we show that our model is able to make statistically better predictions than the baseline. The baseline Gaussian model shows an over-optimistic picture of the COVID-19 scenario. A poorly fitting model could lead to a non optimal decision making, leading to worsening of public health situation.",
