            "text": "Respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS pose a major threat to global health, yet antiviral drugs have been difficult to develop. In addition, treating potential pandemic viral strains is problematic because of the many unknowns about the pathogenesis of infection. Current anti-viral drugs, which target a pathogen\u2019s enzymatic functions and provide a \u201cone-bug-one-drug\u201d approach, use resources inefficiently and are often limited by the emergence of viral resistance (Locarnini and Warner, 2007, Richman et al., 2004). The drug-development process requires the ability to identify specific host factors that are necessary for viral growth and virulence that could also be potential drug targets. In light of the large unmet need for novel antiviral strategies, an efficient solution would be to repurpose currently approved drugs as broad-spectrum, host-centered antivirals that could impair viral transmission and prevent clinical pathology by identifying host factors that are targeted by existing drugs and are required for viral growth.",

Many gene expression microarray studies have proposed distinct gene signatures to discriminate different viral infections (Zaas et al., 2009) or influenza from bacterial infections (Parnell et al., 2012, Parnell et al., 2011, Ramilo et al., 2007). However, these experiments aim to reduce the effect of various biological and technical confounding factors as much as possible by focusing on only one viral infection in one tissue and using one type of microarray. This standard, single-cohort approach increases the risk of confounding factors on gene expression profiles from the specific tissue, technologies, demographics, and inclusion criteria of the respective studies or by other unknown biological and technical factors (Parnell et al., 2011, Parnell et al., 2012, Ramilo et al., 2007), all of which can mask the broad pathways used by multiple viruses to establish infection.",

Using 11 additional independent cohorts, we showed that this influenza-specific signature was able to discriminate (1) symptomatic from asymptomatic subjects, (2) influenza infection from other respiratory viral infections, and (3) patients with mixed influenza and/or bacterial pneumonia from those with bacterial pneumonia alone. Finally, we bridge the gap between influenza infection and vaccination by demonstrating that the influenza infection signature is also increased significantly in influenza vaccine responders compared to non-responders.",

We refer to each study (unique GSE ID) in GEO as a dataset and a set of samples for each comparison within a dataset as a cohort. Unlike a single-cohort experiment, where the goal is to control as many confounding factors as possible, we included broad biological and technical heterogeneity, such as treatment protocols and demographics, observed in the population by choosing discovery cohorts that were collected at different centers (with different treatment protocols and demographics) and that profiled more than one viral infection (influenza, RSV, HRV) across different age groups (infant and pediatric). We incorporated technical heterogeneity in our samples by choosing datasets that were profiled using microarrays from two different manufacturers and represented different technological confounding factors (e.g., length of oligonucleotide probes, sample preparation protocols). In order to avoid the potential influence of a single cohort on the results due to unequal sample sizes or other unknown confounding factors among cohorts, we performed a \u201cleave-one-cohort-out\u201d analysis. We hypothesized that the resulting set of genes that were significantly differentially expressed, irrespective of the set of cohorts analyzed, would constitute a robust signature of respiratory viral infection.",

However, the MVS scores increased significantly for virus-shedding symptomatic subjects over 24\u201372 hr and began to decline toward asymptomatic baseline levels as symptoms resolved (Figures 2C, 2D, S1E, and S1G).

Similarly, the MVS scores for 9 of the 12 H1N1 symptomatic volunteers (75%) were higher than those of the H1N1 asymptomatic volunteers at 53 hr after inoculation (Figure 2D).

(2014), typically vaccine responders and non-responders are defined based on 4-fold change in hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay titers 28 days after vaccination. Therefore, we used this definition to categorize responders and non-responders in two independent vaccination cohorts (GSE: GSE48018 and GSE48023 from Franco et al., 2013) and explored whether the IMS scores showed difference between vaccine responders and non-responders prior to the 28-day mark. In a cohort of 128 females (GSE48023), the IMS scores increased significantly on day 3 after vaccination in responders for H1N1 (paired t test p = 0.002) and H3N2 (paired t test p = 0.015), but not in non-responders (paired t test p > 0.2) (Figures 7B and 7C). Similarly, in a cohort of 119 males (GSE48018), the IMS scores increased significantly in responders for H1N1 and H3N2 (paired t test p < 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221216) on day 1 after vaccination for both H1N1 and H3N2 (Figures 7D and 7E). However, the IMS scores also increased significantly in non-responders (paired t test p < 0.01) for H1N1 and H3N2 in the male cohort, although the increase in the non-responders after vaccination was lower than the responders (Figures 7D and 7E). When we used 4-fold increase in the microneutralization titers on 28 days after vaccination to define responders, the IMS scores showed similar results for both cohorts (Figure S5). These results show that the IMS score increases significantly in vaccine responders and could potentially serve as a marker for successful vaccination.",

However, the magnitude of the change in the average IMS score at 18 hr after infection was higher for cells exposed to influenza viral RNA, infected with PR8 influenza virus lacking NS1 protein, or treated with IFN-\u03b2 and is probably due to the absence of the NS1 protein that inhibits vRNA- or IFN-\u03b2-induced pathways in each of these conditions.",

Our results showed that the MVS is able to (1) distinguish virus-infected patients from those with bacterial infections or healthy controls with high accuracy and (2) identify influenza-infected subjects at risk for being ill before onset of clinical symptoms. Although the clinical utility of the MVS might be limited due to the large number of genes in the signature, it provides a potential starting point for simpler diagnostic gene sets. Importantly, it has identified novel pathways to better understand viral host response and identify targets for novel anti-viral therapies. We also showed that the IMS (1) is specific to influenza infection, (2) is able to distinguish influenza infection from bacterial infections, (3) is predictive of clinical illness in challenge studies, (4) is prognostic in influenza pneumonia patients, (5) is correlated with gene expression changes in subjects responding to influenza vaccination, and (6) showed different dynamics in males and females after influenza vaccination.",

In line with this, the IMS scores changed significantly in responders on day 1 for males and on day 3 for females after vaccination. These results suggest that the effect of sex differences on immune response might be more nuanced in that males respond sooner to vaccination compared to females and that sex differences might also have an effect on the dynamics of an immune response, not just its magnitude.

However, contrary to our integrated multi-cohort analysis, which focused on identifying a robust signature of viral infection, their analysis focused on identifying a common transcriptional response to pathogenic infections irrespective of source (bacterial or viral). Furthermore, their analysis relied on a clustering of gene expression patterns across all studies to identify a \u201ccommon host response\u201d of 511 genes, where these genes were not ubiquitously expressed across all datasets. Instead, we employed an established statistical framework to account for the variability of gene expression, array types, and the number of samples within each study. In addition, all samples used in our analysis for the identification of MVS and IMS were peripheral blood samples, whereas Jenner and Young (2005) used samples from various sources including cell lines, sorted immune cells, and other tissues (liver, skin, astrocytes, fibroblasts, etc.). Because of these important differences in study design, many genes identified by Jenner and Young (2005) as those mediating inflammation were not significantly differentially expressed in our analysis, because they are probably overexpressed during both bacterial and viral infections compared to uninfected individuals. However, a number of the IFN-inducible genes they identified were also overexpressed in our analysis, suggesting that although these genes are overexpressed during bacterial and viral infections, they have greater changes in their expression after influenza infection than bacterial infections.",

However, depending on the cell type, IFN dose, and time of treatment, the number of ISGs can vary from 50 to 1,000 (Schoggins and Rice, 2011). Thus, it has remained unclear which of these genes were most relevant to influenza infection. Herein we identified a concise influenza response signature with many ISGs. Indeed, IFN-\u03b2 treatment of HBECs suggests that some or all of the genes in the IMS are stimulated by IFN. This finding indicates that whereas ISGs are a common element among signatures, a concise and specific gene subset features most importantly in response to influenza.",

These results provide further evidence of the conservation of the response to influenza infection and identify a correlation between the systemic immune response in blood and epithelium at the onset of infection as has been observed before (Ioannidis et al., 2012). However, not all IMS genes were overexpressed in these in vitro studies. For example, as expected, CD38 was not differentially expressed, since its expression is specific to lymphocytes (Moreno-Garc\u00eda et al., 2005, Sandoval-Montes and Santos-Argumedo, 2005).

First, the MVS could serve as a starting point to identify broad host factor targets for developing broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs. Most of the existing anti-viral drugs are based on the one-drug-one-bug philosophy, which is inefficient and ineffective because viruses often mutate to develop drug resistance and novel viral strains can emerge from animal carriers. Instead, developing anti-viral drugs that target host factors involved in multiple respiratory viral infections could provide protection against a broader group of viruses and be more effective against novel strains. Second, the IMS score can be used clinically to distinguish influenza infections, regardless of whether there is concurrent bacterial pneumonia, which could help clinicians to determine whether to initiate antiviral treatments in patients with potential co-infections. Third, the IMS score can be used as a more objective measure of a vaccination response. Our results in influenza-vaccinated individuals show that the IMS score increases significantly in responders but remains unchanged in non-responders.",

After computing meta effect-size, p values were corrected for multiple hypotheses testing via Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), and significant genes were identified via Z-statistic.",
