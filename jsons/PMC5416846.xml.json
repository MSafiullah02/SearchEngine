Mimicry-capable RNAs, such as TYMV, showcase the potential dominance of three-dimensional topology, rather than primary or secondary structure, in determining the biological activity of RNAs (4).",

Further complicating this matter, the free energy landscape often features an ensemble of partially folded and misfolded states (15,16), some of which may have functional utility enabled through alternative geometries.

The PLRV used herein (PDB 2A43, shown in Figure 1B) is an X-ray crystallographic structure which possesses C17U/A18C mutations that greatly enhance its frameshifting efficiency (9). This PLRV exhibits considerable structural and spatial homology with BWYV (17), making it a strong candidate for studies in RNA folding and dynamics, and pseudoknot structure-activity analysis, such as understanding the role of conformational dynamics in \u20131 PRF.",

Charge neutrality was obtained through inclusion of 25 Na+ ions (20) placed randomly around the solute with a minimum RNA-ion separation of 5.0 \u00c5, resulting in an ionic concentration of \u223c100 mM, which is similar in magnitude to most in vitro experimental work of this nature (11). While PLRV has been shown to fold in the absence of divalent ions (21), it is possible that Mg2+, a requirement for the folding of many RNAs, would change the folding behavior of PLRV. Although a comparison of the conformational stabilities and dynamics in the presence and absence of Mg2+ is beyond the scope of the current study, this comparison is a target for future investigation. Steepest-descent energy minimization was followed by solvation in a periodic 75 \u00c5 cubic box with \u223c13500 TIP3P water molecules (22) to capture both the bulk and molecular properties of the ionic aqueous solvent, which was then annealed with the RNA held fixed for 1.0 ns prior to the collection of production simulations. All simulations were run in the NPT ensemble (23) at 1 atm and 300 K using a 2.0 fs timestep with bonds constrained using the LINCS algorithm (24) and conformations stored every 100 ps.

Our previously reported K-means clustering algorithm (25) was then applied to the structures resulting from these thermal unfolding simulations, each of which was represented by a four dimensional vector defined by the pseudoknot radius of gyration (Rg), the all-atom root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) from the native starting structure, and the number of native and non-native base-pairing interactions, as determined by the 3DNA analysis tool (26). This clustering resulted in 41 distinct conformational clusters ranging from fully unfolded, with an RMSD of 30.1 \u00c5 and a radius of gyration of 31.7 \u00c5, to fully folded (RMSD of 0.0 \u00c5 and Rg of 11.9 \u00c5).",

Simulations were considered as part of the native state ensemble if they maintained an all-atom RMSD below 5.0 \u00c5, thereby yielding a total native state simulation time of 8.44 \u03bcs across 1175 simulations. Native contacts for each conformation were then identified for the full pseudoknot structure and for each substructure within the pseudoknot motif. The resulting native contact counts were then normalized using the mean number of native contacts observed in native state simulations; for tertiary (T) native contacts and those in Loop 2 (L2), both of which displayed multi-modal distributions, normalization was done using the maximum in the highest-valued peak in the NC distribution. Contacts between atomic pairs not observed in the simulated native state ensemble were classified as non-native contacts (NNC), an atomic-level analog of the recently-published NNC definition of Mouro et al. (29), and normalized using the largest quantity of non-native contacts observed. We emphasize that this latter normalization of non-native contacts may understate the overall degree of non-native character, and thus the degree of misfolding, present within a given structure.

The more structured U1 state represents the collapsed, or globular, portion of the unfolded conformational space, with a near-native mean gyration radius of \u223c13 \u00c5 and a mean RMSD of \u223c12 \u00c5, and exhibits 16.7(\u00b12.7)% of native contacts, including mean Stem 1 and Stem 2 native contact counts of 34.3(\u00b18.2)% and 11.9(\u00b119.5)%, respectively, thereby indicating that stem nucleation may occur within this region of the conformational space, as might the reversing of such nucleation, sans the formation of loop or tertiary contacts. As the mean quantity of non-native contacts for U1 was 32.7(\u00b115.2)% (Table 1), it could be argued that this is a misfolded rather than unfolded state. Our classification of U1 as an unfolded state is based primarily upon the presence of this state along the folding pathway, in which it readily transitions to and from the less-native U2 state and the I3 intermediate described above, as well as the observation that nearly half of the detected non-native contacts within this state occur between the first three residues (5\u0384 terminus) and the five residues directly succeeding them, indicating dominance of highly accessible local interactions rather than long-range or large scale structure formation.",

A strong correlation between the formation of Loop 2 and tertiary contacts is evident in Figure 7C at low to moderate native contact values, with somewhat larger quantities of tertiary contacts and somewhat fewer Loop 2 contacts seemingly favored, suggesting that the formation of tertiary structure prompts further formation of Loop 2 structure. In contrast, at high native contact values the existence of alternative states that favor either increased Loop 2 structure or increased tertiary structure, but not both, reinforces our prior description of the transition between the alternative F1 and F2 native states. Given the quantitative descriptions of the observed intermediates above, alongside our sampling of the free energy landscape shown in Figure 7D, it can be inferred that Stem 2 largely forms prior to both Loop 2 and tertiary contact formation, but may also form later in the folding process, in tandem with the initiation of Loop 2 and tertiary contacts.",

It was also suspected that the U17\u2013C18\u2013A19 linker region plays an important role in initiating ribosomal contact based on proximity to the 5\u0384 terminus and intermolecular association observed during crystallization (9). As with U12 and A19, the U17 and C18 residues remained virtually unchanged between states F1 and F2, and these residues displayed no significant non-native intramolecular associations within our observed macrostate ensembles. Unlike U12 and A19, however, the U17\u2013C18 pair demonstrates high rigidity (low RMSF in Figure 5A), which derives from \u03c0-stacking of these bases and the G3\u00b7C16\u2013A20 base-triplet at the 5\u0384 terminus of Stem 1. These observations are consistent with the speculation noted above, with U12 and A19 being most suitable for ribosomal recognition when remaining looped-out and flexible, while the much more rigid U17 and C18 residues serve to anchor the looped-out position of A19 for recognition with the ribosomal machinery.",

For example, Gao and Simon recently showed that for a structurally similar member of Luteoviridae, pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV), frameshifting efficiency is correlated with Stem 1 stability, but not overall thermodynamic stability (12). This agrees well with our observations of PLRV where Stem 1, which is composed solely of G\u00b7C base-pairs, demonstrates high structural rigidity (low RMSF in Figure 5A), and supports a mechanism based on ribosomal recognition via looped-out viral mRNA nucleotides: ample destabilization of Stem 1, and fraying or destruction of 5\u0384 terminal G3\u00b7C16\u2013A20 base-triplet interactions, would disrupt the structure of the U17\u2013C18\u2013A19 linker, leading to potential dislocation of A19 from the looped-out position needed for suitable positioning relative to the ribosome. Analogously, destabilization of the opposite end of Stem 1, the G6\u00b7C13\u2013A24 base-triplet, could have a similar impact on the looped-out U12 residue.",

While the direct result of this mutation would allow for increased preference for contiguous A-stacking within Loop 2, an indirect result of this increased Loop 2 structural stabilization would be an enhanced preference to maintain the looped-out nucleotide atop Loop 2, keeping that residue in place to interact with the ribosome. In addition, SRV-1 displays a third base-triplet between an adenine in Loop 2 and a G\u00b7C base pair that acts as the linker between Stems 1 and 2. This linker region in SRV-1 is analogous to the U12 linker in PLRV, the latter of which lacks base pair and triplet interactions altogether. In line with the structural logic presented above, Olsthoorn et al. reported that loss of this third base-triplet interaction in SRV-1 (via mutation to a U\u00b7A base pair) decreased PRF by nearly a factor of 4 (11), again supporting Stem 1 stability as a determining factor in PRF efficiency, and suggesting that a lone, looped-out nucleotide linker, such as U12 in PLRV and U13 in BWYV (55), provides some structural advantage which offsets the potential loss from an additional base-triplet and can thereby facilitate more optimal ribosomal recognition.",

Our observed conformational dynamics is well in line with this observation: our simulations provide structural evidence for multiple native states, partially-folded intermediates, and misfolded states that would be accessible upon refolding of the pseudoknot motif following mechanical unfolding at the ribosome, with transitions between these states readily occurring on sub-millisecond timescales. In addition, the stability of Stem 1, and of Stem 1\u2013Loop 2 base-triplet interactions, has been shown to enhance PRF efficiency, which our model accounts for in terms of a resulting preference to maintain looped-out residues (U12 and A19) that can participate in ribosomal recognition. Our computational characterization of alternative native states and regions of high flexibility (Loop 1, Loop 2 and the U12 linker), alongside a conformational equilibrium involving numerous available macrostates, thus supports the conformational plasticity-based model of \u20131 PRF. Indeed, the apparent necessity for regions of high stability and rigidity alongside much more structurally-adaptable regions within the pseudoknot assembly, as a prerequisite for efficient PRF, provides a most intriguing \u2018micro-machine\u2019 view of the function of even this relatively miniscule viral RNA sequence.",

We report herein the presence of two alternate native state conformations, in which a global topological twisting mode allows for alternation between optimizing Loop 2 contacts and tertiary contacts between that loop and the minor groove of the neighboring base-paired stem region. Three folding intermediates have been identified and characterized, as have multiple misfolded states. While misfolding has been the focus of many protein-oriented studies, less attention has been given to this topic with respect to nucleic acids, and we present here the first all-atom, simulation-based study of this nature to probe RNA misfolding.",

Namely, from geometric and statistical considerations, we propose that stem folding order may be predicted by the relative sequence distances between adjacent strands that must find one another to form properly base-paired native stem regions (i.e. the stem-strand-sequence-separation).",

We look forward to expanding on these findings: indeed, the diversity of this data set is testament to the level of detail now achievable through MD simulation methods, which we expect will only continue to open new avenues of RNA investigation.",
