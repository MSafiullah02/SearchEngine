The requirements for drug manufacturing and especially the safety aspects related to the final medicine have become immense. This development has made the drug discovery and development processes both time-consuming and labor intensive. Not surprisingly, development of drugs has become extremely expensive. In addition, the success rate of bringing new successful drugs to the market has been worryingly low. One approach to speed up drug discovery and also to reduce the adverse effects of developed drugs has been to apply structure-based drug design. There are a number of examples of success. For instance, structural information has played an important role in lead optimization in drug screening programs (\n1\n). Furthermore, high-resolution structures of HIV proteinase (\n2\n) and influenza virus neuraminidase (\n3\n) have contributed directly to the development of AIDS (Agenerase\u00ae and Viracept\u00ae) and flu (Relenza\u00ae) drugs, respectively. In total, more than 10 drugs can today be considered as designed based on known high-resolution structures of target molecules.",

The simple reason is the very small number of high-resolution structures available for membrane proteins in general and more specifically for drug targets.

Assay development has focused strongly on automation and miniaturization and, for instance, fluorescence intensity, fluorescence polarization, time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), and fluorescence macroconfocal technology (FMAT) methods have been utilized for high-throughput screening in 96-, 384-, and 1536-well formats (\n15\n).

Application of Ca2+-sensitive dyes has allowed fluorescence imaging in automated 384-well format. Other screening approaches include the establishment of stable cell lines for second messenger and reporter gene detection (\u03b2-lactamase and luciferase) for detection of transcriptional regulation of promoter elements activated by GPCRs (\n18\n). Moreover, transient expression of GPCRs in melanophores from the neural crest of Xenopus laevis has allowed monitoring functional activity by measurement of light absorption based on pigment dispersion (\n19\n). Today agonist activation and antagonist inhibition has been evaluated for more than 100 GPCRs in the melanophore system.

Moreover, structural information on GPCR ligands has presented the basis for design of chemical libraries for screening purposes (\n21\n). Pharmacophore-based design of combinatorial libraries was applied to design a novel series of indolyl sulfonamides as selective high-affinity serotonin 5-HT6 receptor ligands and resulted in the identification of some novel compounds (\n22\n). Pharmacophore models have also been used for virtual screening approaches to identify nonpeptidic ligands for peptide-binding GPCRs such as the somatostatin receptor known for its poor bioavailability and low metabolic stability (\n23\n). Nonpeptidic antagonists for the urotensin II receptor could be identified based on truncated peptide derivatives of the cyclic 11 amino acid peptide urotensin II (\n24\n). Alanine scanning and NMR spectroscopy resulted in the identification of the Trp-Lys-Trp motif in the cyclic part of the human urotensin II. Likewise, when two different pharmacore models were established 172 virtual antagonist hits were identified for the muscarinic M3 receptor leading to three compounds with a novel scaffold (\n25\n).

Three different docking programs (Dock, FlexX, Gold) were used in combination with seven scoring functions (ChemScore, Dock, FlexX, Fresno, Gold, Pmf, Score). In another approach, PREDICT was applied for virtual screening of several GPCRs resulting in enrichment factors of 9- to 44-fold better than what was obtained from random screening (\n43\n). Moreover, a practical scoring function was applied to assess the druggability of compounds, which consisted of 12 metrics taking into account physical, chemical, and structural properties and undesirable functional groups (\n44\n). Evaluation of the 12-metric scoring function for 44 different databases including more than 3.8 million commercially available compounds indicated that the majority of compounds that did not show satisfactory druggability had a high molecular weight and high logP values and also indicated the presence of reactive functional groups.",

Other GPCRs such as taste receptors can also form dimers. Most interestingly, the heterodimeric T1R1+T1R3 combination generates the umami receptor, whereas the T1R2+T1R3 heterodimer defines the sensor for sweet taste (\n47\n,\n48\n). Moreover, when the leukotriene BLT1 receptor was expressed in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies low-affinity binding homodimers were obtained after refolding, which could be reverted to high-affinity binding after addition of a heterotrimeric G\u03b112\u03b21\u03b32 complex to the refolded GPCRs (\n49\n).

As the seven-transmembrane topology of GPCRs makes the expression more difficult and demanding compared to soluble protein, it is not surprising that more or less every available expression system has been tested (\n58\n). Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems have been used frequently and recently also cell-free E. coli- and wheat germ-based systems have been applied. Although cell-free translation has mainly been used for soluble proteins, novel development has also allowed reasonable expression of membrane proteins (\n59\n,\n60\n). E. coli vectors are the most frequently used prokaryotic vectors. GPCRs have been expressed both in inclusion bodies (\n61\n) and the plasma membrane (\n62\n). The approach of production in inclusion bodies generates relatively high expression level, but the drawback is that extensive refolding exercise is required to restore the GPCR (\n63\n). On the other hand, targeting GPCRs to the plasma membrane can generate functional GPCRs. However, the membrane insertion often results in growth regression of bacterial host cells and reduced recombinant protein yields due to the GPCR toxicity. Improved expression has been achieved by introduction of mutations and deletions in the target GPCR and engineering fusions to, for instance, maltose binding protein (MBP) (\n64\n). This approach has resulted in production of milligram levels of rat neurotensin receptor in E. coli cultured in fermentors (\n65\n). In addition to E. coli, Halobacterium salinarum\n(\n66\n) and Lactococcus lactis\n(\n67\n) have been applied for GPCR expression. The yields obtained have so far, however, been relatively modest.",

The most frequently used yeast hosts are Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n(\n68\n,\n69\n) and Pichia pastoris\n(\n70\n). Particularly, the application of P. pastoris has resulted in high binding activity (up to 100 pmol/mg) and impressive yields (5 mg/L) of a large number of GPCRs (\n71\n). Likewise, Baculovirus vectors carrying GPCRs have been introduced into insect cells resulting in robust expression of functionally active GPCRs (\n72\n). Up to 16 GPCRs were expressed from Baculovirus vectors in parallel resulting in 250 pmol/mg receptor (\n73\n). The production of GPCRs in insect cells cultured in bioreactors has provided sufficient material for structural studies on GPCRs as described below. Application of mammalian expression systems for the overexpression of GPCRs has been to some extent hampered by time-consuming and expensive procedures and low expression levels. Despite that a mutant HEK293 cell line allowed production of up to 6 mg/L of rhodopsin (\n74\n). A number of viral vectors such as adenoviruses, vaccinia viruses, lentiviruses, and alphaviruses have also been used for GPCR expression. Particularly, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) vectors, an alphavirus, have been applied for the expression of more than 100 GPCRs in different cell lines (\n75\n,\n76\n). The SFV system has shown high expression levels measured by saturation binding (>100 pmol/mg) and functional coupling to G proteins (intracellular Ca2+ release, inositol phosphate accumulation, cAMP stimulation, and GTP\u03b3S binding). Furthermore, the system has been scaled up to allow large-scale production in multiple liter volumes in spinner and roller flasks as well as in bioreactors.",

Tertiary models of various GPCRs have been built based on the high-resolution structure of bacteriorhodopsin obtained from Halobacterium salinarium\n(\n77\n). A further improvement occurred when the three-dimensional structure of bovine rhodopsin became available (\n78\n) as modeling could switch to this mammalian receptor. However, the real breakthrough was seen very recently when the high-resolution structure of the human \u03b22-adrenergic receptor\u2013lysozyme complex was solved by receptor overexpression in Baculovirus-infected insect cells (\n79\n,\n80\n). The fusion protein was bound to the partial inverse agonist carazolol at a 2.4 \u00c5 resolution. Despite a similar location of carazolol in the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor and retinal in rhodopsin, structural differences in the ligand-binding site and other regions were observed. This clearly signifies the shortcomings of using rhodopsin as a template for GPCR modeling.",

            "text": "In absence of high-resolution structures, site-directed mutagenesis has been applied to investigate the site(s) of interaction between GPCRs and their ligands. In combination with bioinformatics and modeling, site-directed mutagenesis supported by in vitro expression in cells can provide important information on change in binding affinity and functional activity. For instance, mutation of an asparagine residue in the TM2 of the GnRH receptor resulted in complete loss of binding activity (\n81\n). However, the presence of a second mutation in the TM7 restored the binding activity, which indicated a close proximity of TM2 and TM7. Studies on the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) showed that three adjacent N-terminal residues (Asn23, Glu24, and Phe25) affected substance P binding (\n82\n). Moreover, His108 located on the top of TM3 and Tyr287 on the top of TM7 were shown to interact with substance P (\n83\n). Other studies revealed that the binding mode for the nonpeptide antagonist CP 96,345 was different from substance P (\n84\n) for NK1R and their binding pockets were also different (\n85\n). Furthermore, mutant His197 showed a significantly reduced affinity to CP 96,345 (\n86\n). For other GPCRs, it was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis that ligand binding at the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor occurred mainly within the membrane-spanning regions flanking TMs 3, 5, 6, and 7 (\n87\n) and that three binding sites for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), propranolol, and 8-hydroxy-N,N-diproprylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) within the highly conserved 7TM domain existed for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (\n88\n). Overall, based on results obtained from molecular modeling and mutagenesis studies it was suggested that family A receptors might share a common binding pocket (\n89\n,\n90\n). However, because the same effect can be obtained by allosteric modulations (\n91\n) and constitutive signaling (\n92\n) this view might be oversimplified.",

Although drug screening on GPCRs is anticipated to constitute a large part of these activities other approaches will be applied. Much attention will be given to the design of larger and more specialized (GPCR-oriented) libraries. The development of sophisticated software programs and the advancement in bioinformatics will further improve the possibilities of increasing virtual screening methods. This will certainly significantly reduce both costs and time in drug development. As most of the conventional approaches for GPCR screening have already been explored and the chances of discovery of novel drug molecules diminish, it will be essential to look for new opportunities. Orphan GPCRs might be interesting targets for further exploration as ligand molecules with novel therapeutic properties might be discovered. Moreover, investigation of non-G protein signaling pathways for GPCRs might reveal novel mechanisms of actions and in that context discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Finally, structure-based drug design has indeed seen a major breakthrough through the determination of the first human GPCR structure. It is anticipated that other GPCR structures will follow shortly, which will certainly open up extensive new possibilities for rational drug design approaches.",
