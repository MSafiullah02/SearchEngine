Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, for Singapore from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays, using a generalized growth model and employing a renewal equation. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. As of February 19 th , 2020, our results indicate that the mean effective reproduction number Rt is at 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1,1.3) while an estimate of Rt based on cluster size distribution is at 0.63 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.05). These estimates underscore positive impact of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.",

The initial cases have been linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, pointing to an animal source of the epidemic [3] . Subsequently, rapid humanto-human transmission of the disease was confirmed in January 2020, and the etiological agent was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to its genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV discovered in 2003 [1, 4] . The total case tally has reached 75,700 infections including 2128 deaths as of February 19, 2020 [1, 2] . As the virus continues to spread in the human population, obtaining an accurate \"real-time\" picture of the epidemic's trajectory is complicated by several factors including reporting delays and changes in the case definition [5, 6] . Although the epidemic appears to be on a downward trend in China, cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported in 26 countries around the globe, and local transmission is ongoing in Singapore, Japan, Korea and Thailand [7] . Detailed epidemiological data from these countries is needed to monitor transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in near real-time.",

To minimize the risk of hospital-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the Ministry of Health of Singapore has restricted the movement of patients and staff across hospitals [18] . Also, because multiple unlinked community cases of COVID-19 have been reported [19] , various social distancing measures have been put in place including advising the public against large social gatherings in order to mitigate the risk of community transmission [20, 21] .

On the other hand, reproduction numbers above 1.0 indicate sustained community transmission [16, 24] . Using epidemiological data and mathematical modeling tools, we are monitoring the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore in real-time, and here we report results as of February 19, 2020. Specifically, we assess the effective reproduction number from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset after adjusting for reporting delays, and we also derive an estimate of the reproduction number based on the characteristics of the clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore.",

However, it is possible to adjust epidemic curves by reporting delays using statistical methods [27] . The reporting delay for a case is defined as the time lag in days between the date of onset and date of reporting. Here we adjusted the COVID-19 epidemic curve of local cases by reporting delays using a nonparametric method that employs survival analysis techniques [28] [29] [30] .

Estimates of Rt>1 indicate sustained transmission; whereas, Rt <1 implies that the outbreak is slowing down and the incidence trend is declining. Hence, maintaining Rt <1 is required to bring an outbreak under control. Using the reporting delay adjusted incidence curve, we estimate the most recent estimate of Rt for COVID-19 in Singapore. We first characterize daily incidence of local cases using the generalized growth model (GGM) after adjusting for imported cases. This model characterizes the growth profile via two parameters: the growth rate (r) and the scaling of the growth parameter (p). The GGM can reproduce a range of growth dynamics, including constant growth (p=0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth We denote the local incidence at calendar time \" by \" , the raw incidence of imported cases at calendar time \" by \" , and the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval by \" .",

On the other hand, it is not clear if asymptomatic or subclinical cases are as infectious as symptomatic cases. Indeed, we have reported that multiple local cases have yet to be traced to existing transmission chains. Additional data collected during the course of the outbreak will help obtain an improved picture of the transmission dynamics [8] . These findings emphasize the need to strengthen public health interventions including active case contact tracing activities in countries with emerging transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

This indicates that containment efforts are having a significant impact in Singapore. However, some differences in the reproduction numbers reported for the epidemic in China may result from different methods, differences in data sources, and time periods used to estimate the reproduction number. Similarly, a recent study has shown an average reporting delay of 6.1 days in China [54] which agrees with our mean estimate for local cases (6.9 days). Moreover, the scaling parameter for growth rate (p) indicates a sub-exponential growth pattern in Singapore, reflecting the effective isolation and control strategies in the region. This is consistent with a sub-exponential growth pattern for Chinese provinces excluding Hubei (p=0.67), as estimated by a recent study [55] ; whereas, an exponential growth pattern was estimated for Hubei (p~1.0) [55] .",

The lower estimate of the dispersion parameter in our study also indicate significant transmission heterogeneity in Singapore. Super-spreading events of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV associated with nosocomial outbreaks have been observed in the past and attributed to substantial diagnostic delays [16, 30] . Although the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis for COVID-19 patients in Singapore is 7.9 days and no super-spreading event has been observed yet, the dispersion parameter, k<1, indicates the probability of observing large clusters and the potential for super-spreading [56, 57] . Therefore, public health measures enacted by public health authorities in Singapore that advise the public to avoid mass gatherings and confined places are crucial to prevent disease amplification events. However, the presence of asymptomatic cases in the community represent an ongoing threat [58, 59] although it is not currently known if subclinical cases are less infectious.

Investigations are also underway to identify additional cases linked to the \"Grace Assembly of God\" cluster in Singapore. Our study is not exempt from limitations. First, the outbreak is still ongoing and we continue to monitor the transmission potential of COVID-19 in Singapore. Second, onset dates are missing in nine cases, which were excluded from our analyses. Third, we cannot rule out that additional cases will be added to existing clusters, which may lead to underestimating the reproduction number based on the cluster size distribution. Lastly, the cluster size analysis is modeled under the assumption that there is one primary case (i.e. all cases can be connected eventually to one person), rather than being multiple imported cases. Additional work could be conducted to account for the uncertainty regarding the primary number of cases per cluster and the possibility of ongoing transmission in some clusters.",

It is worth noting that ignoring the presence of imported cases, our estimates would have been slightly underestimated (by about 0.1 in absolute value). Based on the entire distribution of cluster sizes, we jointly estimated the reproduction number R and the dispersion parameter k. Fitting the negative binomial distribution to the cluster data in the empirical distributions of the realizations during the early stages of the outbreak in Singapore, the reproduction number is estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.1) after adjusting for the independent and identically distributed observation probability of 50%.

Overall, the current situation in Singapore highlights the need to investigate the unlinked and asymptomatic cases that could be a potential source of secondary cases. Although Singapore has a highly efficient contact tracing mechanism in place [22], continued epidemiological investigations and active case finding efforts are needed to control the outbreak.",
