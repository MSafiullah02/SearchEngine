In catastrophic situations, medical and public health resources may be placed under severe stress and overwhelmed by the volume of victims. The existence of a reserve, surge manpower response capacity may be a necessity for some postdisaster actions to be effective. However, there is a need for that surge personnel reserve to be familiar with disaster medicine, public health, and logistic principles and practices to positively enhance the response. Further, surge responders need to be integrated into the local disaster planning.9 This survey was to determine the responsibility and ability of optometry professionals to serve as a competent adjunct in cases of disasters, to explore possible roles for optometrists as a manpower reserve, and to identify the most appropriate trainers for optometrists to serve as surge responders.",
