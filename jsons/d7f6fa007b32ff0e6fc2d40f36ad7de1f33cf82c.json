Including criteria were patients who: 1) had been diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the criteria established by WHO interim guidance 2, 11, 12 and 2) were admitted to the ICU because of severe or critical conditions. Patients who were < 18 years old or those whose entire stay in hospital lasted for < 48 hours were excluded. The severity of the disease was categorized according to published criteria 13, 14 . Criteria for severe cases included any of the following: 1) Respiratory rate \u2265 30 per minute; 2) blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) \u2264 93% at rest; 3) partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300; or 4) more than 50% of lung infiltrates within 24 to 48 hours. Patients needing mechanical ventilatory support or presenting with septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction or failure constituted the critical cases.",

However, in non-survivors treated with ECMO, the echocardiographic improvement was temporary; and the right-heart dysfunction deteriorated again before death (Supplementary Figure 1) , similar to the post ECMO scenario in children with pulmonary hypertension from pertussis 38 .
