            "text": "Rabies virus G protein is a transmembrane protein with 505 amino acids that weighs 65\u201367 kDa (kda) (Ross et al. 2008) and forms spicules that project outward from the infected cell forming trimers. This protein is used by the virus to join with the host cells and initiates the relationship between them when the cell receptors link. Amino acids 1 through 439 are responsible for the attachment of the virus to the cell receptors causing a fusion of the viral and cell membranes (Gaudin et al. 1993; Gaudin et al. 1999). The three protein-type membrane receptors for the rabies virus that have been identified are (1) the nicotinic receptor for acetylcholine, (2) the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor, and (3) the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). These receptors are implicated in the adsorption of the rabies virus and the promotion of infection directly into the nerve ends and/or gangliosides located in neurons or at the point of axoplasmic transport of muscles. The virus moves along the dorsal ganglions and spinal cord; the brain is quickly infected causing apoptosis of the nerve cells and T cells (Lafon 2011). A total of five antigenic sites have been identified in the soluble region of the protein: I, II, III, IV, and \u201ca,\u201d which are located in residues 231, 330\u2013338, 264, and 342\u2013343, respectively. The antigenic site II, located in position 34\u201342 and 198\u2013200, had only been recognized under denaturing conditions (Benmansour et al. 1991). Furthermore, the presence of a residue of the Glu amino acid in position 333 has been related with the invasion of neurons and pathogenicity (Wunner 2002); the lack of this amino acid causes nonrecognition of the virus and the strains become nonpathogenic.",

In the case of wild rabies, specifically in foxes, the first massive oral vaccination was carried out in 1978 within the Rh\u00f4ne Valley in Switzerland and later it was extended to various other territories. This distribution was carried out manually using vaccine-laden bait (12\u201325 bait/km2) within endemic zones (Wandeler 2000, Bugnon et al. 2004). The first recombinant vaccine was the VR-G developed in 1984 in which the sequence of the G gene was inserted into a plasmid together with the Vaccinia promoter and flanked by the viral thymidine kinase gene. This plasmid was used to transfect cells that had been previously infected with a wild Vaccinia strain, and using homologous recombination, it was possible to obtain the recombinant plasmid (Kieny et al. 1984; Paolazzi et al. 1999. Oral immunization of foxes has allowed the large-scale elimination of the virus in areas of Europe where the baits have been placed. Oral vaccination with the vaccines Raboral V-RG (Vaccinia recombinant virus expressing G protein) (Kieny et al. 1984) and with Rabigen SAG2 (double mutant avirulent strain SAG2) (Artois et al. 1992) was effective for wild rabies in Europe which has helped to almost eradicate wild rabies in the western part of the continent (Desmettre et al. 1990) and has been successful for rabies control in Canada, the United States, and other countries (Lontai 1997; Mainguy et al. 2013). Nevertheless, until now, there is no effective oral vaccination for reservoir species. Notably, in the United States, there are no licensed vaccines for skunks.",

The first experience with the expression of the G protein of the rabies virus was in tomatoes (McGarvey et al. 1995). The full G gene of the virus was cloned into the BIN19 vector downstream of the 35S CaMV promoter. Later, tomato cells were transformed by infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The expressed glycoprotein was purified by immunoprecipitation from leaves and fruits, and two bands, one of 60 kDa and another of 62 kDa, were detected with Western blot. This variation in protein weight could be due to differential glycosylation in the plant cell. The amount of recombinant glycoprotein in leaves was between approximately 1 and 10 ng/mg of soluble protein, while fruits had lower amounts.",

Also, as a way to improve the expression of proteins in plants, other viruses have been used as vectors to infect plant tissue such as the alfalfa mosaic virus (AIMV) using the coat protein (Cp) which serves a carrier for the peptides to be expressed. In this manner, Yusibov et al. (1997) expressed using this system the G and N proteins of the rabies virus and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These constructs were inoculated into tobacco plants (Nicotiana benthamiana) in order to later isolate the virus from the leaves and semi-purify the viral particles for their inoculation of mice. Animals received seven doses (10 \u03bcg per dose) via intraperitoneal injection and assessing the response in the presence or absence of adjuvant. Using antibodies against the Cp protein, the presence of a 28.9 kDa band was found in Western blot which corresponds to the fusion protein formed by the Cp protein of AIMV and the viral peptides of the rabies virus. The identification of each peptide was carried out using monoclonal antibodies against each of them. Finally, it was demonstrated that the viral particles that were inoculated promoted an immune response in mice against the rabies virus antigens, as well as those of HIV-1, regardless of the adjuvant was present or not.",

Corn is a cereal rich in protein which is used for both human and animal consumption; this plant has been an adequate experimental model because of the high levels of expression of transgenes obtained. It was perceived as a species with great potential for producing an edible vaccine. The vector used for the transformation of the plant was pGHCNS. G gene rabies virus was cloned downstream of the promoter and the maize ubiquitin promoter 35ScaMV. The expression cassette was flanked by matrix attachment region (MARs). Maize embryogenic calluses were transformed with the above construction by biolistics. Regenerated maize plants were recovered and grown in greenhouse. The presence of the G gene and its products was detected in vegetal tissue by PCR and Western blot. A fine powder was prepared from transformed grains and administered as pellet (50 \u03bcg of recombinant G protein). Other groups of mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 \u03bcg of G protein using a commercial vaccine. All mice were challenged intracerebrally at day 90 post-vaccination using a vampire bat rabies virus which is used to evaluate commercial vaccine in Mexico. Embryogenic calluses were transformed by biolistics and herbicide-resistant plants were obtained. Twenty-five plants were recovered and 92 % contained the G gene as detected by PCR. The rabies G protein was identified by Western blot and presented a size of about 69 kDa. This increase in molecular weight may be due to posttranslational modifications, and this modification does not seem to have any adverse effect on the antigenic properties of the protein. Similar modifications were showed by McGarvey et al. (1995). Protein was expressed at 1 % of total soluble protein, which is equivalent to about 50 \u03bcg per gram of fresh weight in mass. This study obtained a higher level of expression than ever reported. The level of expression obtained in this study is comparable to results obtained by others in maize when expressing the spike protein of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and the fusion protein of Newcastle disease virus (Lamphear et al. 2002; Guerrero-Andrade et al. 2006). In sera, mice were seronegative at the start of the experiment, but by day 90 post-vaccination, titers varied by more than 0.5 IU. The animals were protected at 100 %, similar at the commercial vaccine. This work has demonstrated that the systems for transformation, selection, and regeneration of mice developed in this study are efficient. Likewise, the plant-based G protein was able to induce viral neutralizing antibodies and protect mice after challenge.",

For transformation, we decided to use the minimal cassette expression approach (promoter-gene-terminator). We employed carrot seeds for induction of carrot callus. We were able to regenerate 300 adult plants from 100 calli selected in liquid medium, and 93.3 % of the analyzed plants showed integration of the transgene with levels of expression varying from 0.2 to 1.4 % TSP. In our project, the plant-produced band migrated slightly above the native G protein (~70 vs 65 kDa); one likely explanation for this was glycosylation of the protein by the plant.

Embryogenic calluses were transformed by biolistics and herbicide-resistant plants were obtained in liquid medium. The presence of the G gene in leaves was determined by PCR and the protein was detected by Western blot using rabbit polyclonal serum against rabies G protein. In order to evaluate the carrot as vaccine, 24 mice were divided into four groups: G1, fed standard mouse chow (negative control); G2, received an intramuscular dose of inactivated rabies vaccine; G3, mice fed 50 \u03bcg of rabies virus G protein in 2 g of raw carrot; and G4, mice received 50 \u03bcg rabies virus G protein contained in 2 g of raw carrot plus 50 \u03bcg of N protein rabies virus (N protein was orally administered) since this molecule has been reported as adjuvant in some rabies vaccines. Mice vaccinated were challenged intracerebrally 60 days post-vaccination. We showed that the ingestion of antigen expressed in carrot resulted in protective rabies antibodies (66 %). These results are consistent with previous studies where the glycoprotein of rabies virus was expressed either in tobacco or in spinach. In this study, we did not observe a 100 % protection of the mice; this is possibly because a greater concentration of G protein is necessary.

Nevertheless, the fact that transformed corn must not be grown on open fields must be taken into account since it is an open pollination plant. It should be grown in greenhouses with the highest biosecurity. There are also issues that still need to be resolved, such as the antigen dose that each plant produces since it could produce tolerance (Loza-Rubio and Rojas-Anaya 2010). One possible alternative for the production of antigenic proteins using plants as an expression system is the use of suspension plant cell in pellets that express the antigens of interest. This would avoid the need for growing the plants in greenhouses. The administration would be oral, which is a significant advantage that could be of interest to pharmaceutical companies.",

Regulation can occur at any step of the expression process, and the promoters that manage it ensure the said control during transcription. The election of a promoter for plant transformation depends on the objective and purpose for which the plant is being transformed, as well as its species. Promoters that are specific to the species or tissue can be used, as well as those for seeds or grains, flowers, pollen, roots, leaves, or even aerial tissue (Buchanan et al. 2000; Potenza et al. 2004). Within the promoter are regulating regions, sequence motifs, or cis elements; these regulating sequences are known as increasers. These can be located upstream or downstream of the coding region. These regions are required to carry out the maximum transcription of a gene, and it is due to this reason that they are used within plant transformation vectors (Alberts et al. 2002).",

Because of all this, legislation is necessary, both at global and local levels, on the research and development of biological products using transgenic plants as a platform. In this regard, Hungary became the first Central European country to adopt legislation on the regulation of genetic engineering activity. Its Gene Technology Law entered into force in January 1999 with the concomitant establishment of an advisory body (The Gene Technology Committee).

In addition, within each of these sectors, GMOs may vary considerably, requiring different kinds of regulations, for example:Some species are not grown for food (e.g., cotton), so food safety regulations are not strictly an issue although it should be kept in mind that some material, e.g., pollen/honey derived from GM, may still enter the food chain.The same species may be modified for very different traits, e.g., an agricultural crop or animal may be modified to produce human pharmaceuticals as tomatoes producing vaccines against virus or animals producing hormones. \u201cPharmed\u201d products under development include vaccines, antibodies, and industrial proteins and, in the crop sector, involve banana, maize, potato, and tomato plants. Special regulations covering potential gene flow to their conventional counterparts may be necessary;Regulations may vary depending on whether the GM species is produced for export or domestic use. For this reason, GMO commercialization is subject to a strict marketability requirement. Otherwise, GMO varieties are not approved for commercialization.

It is important that scientific institutions and community promote the use of everyday language to describe the benefit of new technological discoveries. For example, the use of the word \u201ctransgenic\u201d is perceived as something that is against nature, and in some cases, it has been used instead of \u201ctransgender\u201d in mass media causing further confusion.

These plants were successful antigen production systems. According to the results obtained in this study, it was found that the G protein expressed in the plant systems under evaluation was functional, even though it had suffered some posttranslational modifications. When immunity assays were carried out, it was found that corn tissue was the most effective in providing greater protection when challenged with rabies virus from hematophagous bats, which are the main transmitter of this virus in Mexico. Results show that both carrot and corn are convenient systems for the expression of the G protein since good expression levels were achieved and such levels would allow the production of a subunit vaccine. Nevertheless, the expression of the N protein in tomato plants was not satisfactory. It is noteworthy that the use of biolistics allows permanent expression since the transgene is integrated into the plant genome and from there it segregates into future generations thus obtaining a good candidate for an edible vaccine against the rabies virus in animals and humans.",
