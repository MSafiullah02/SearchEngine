First of all, we describe different strategies developed during the last years to circumvent the inherent difficulties of classical oligosaccharide synthesis, such as the one-pot glycosylation and the solid-phase synthesis, and their application to the preparation of carbohydrate antigens apt to conjugation with protein carriers. Next, we discuss the most representative methodologies employed for the chemical ligation of oligosaccharide structures to proteins. Finally, in the last section, we report significant examples of fully synthetic vaccines exploiting the multivalency effect. These constructs are based on the concept that the conjugation of multiple copies of synthetic oligosaccharide antigens to multivalent scaffolds, such as dendrimers, (cyclo)peptides, gold nanoparticles, and calixarenes, raises cooperative interactions between carbohydrates and immune receptors, leading to strong enhancement of the saccharide antigen immunogenicity. An antigenic determinant, or epitope, is the portion of an antigenic molecule that is bound by a given antibody.",

The innate response is mediated by APCs and it acts during the early stages of the infection. APCs detect and respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), structurally and chemically diverse compounds that are unique to foreign microorganisms, via a multiple set of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), including peptidoglycan recognition proteins, scavenger receptors, C-type lectin receptors typically including a carbohydr-binding domain, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Binding to PRRs induces the pathogen engulfment by APC and its intracellular processing, i.e., enzymatic degradation into short peptides that eventually bind the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule and are exposed on cell surface to be presented to T cells. T and B cells T and B cells are the two subsets of lymphocytes defined by their development in the thymus and bone marrow, respectively. T cell epitope T cell epitope is the minimal portion of an antigenic molecule (typically a peptide) needed to elicit a T cell-dependent immune response.",

            "text": "Together with proteins and nucleic acids, carbohydrates are a major class of biopolymers that mediate a wide range of biological processes in living organisms. It is now well established that, for example, carbohydrates play crucial roles in viral and bacterial invasion, angiogenesis and tumor cells metastasis, embryogenesis, inflammatory reactions, and, more generally speaking, in a large number of fundamental molecular recognition phenomena (Varki et al. 2009; Dwek 1996; Varki 1993) . In particular, there is a growing interest towards what is known as glycoimmunology: this term derives from the merger of glycobiology with immunology, and it deals with the peculiar interactions of carbohydrates with the immune system, emphasizing the importance of using carbohydrates to induce protective immunity against microbial infections but also cancer metastasis. This relatively new field is based on the concept that diverse pathogens and malignant cells expose on their surface a dense array of often unique glycan structures that exert a protective function against the host's immune defense and are essential for their pathogenicity. Typical examples are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, the polysaccharide coat (capsular polysaccharides, CPS) of encapsulated bacteria, and diverse glycoproteins/glycolipids specifically expressed on viral and cancer cell surface. On the other hand, all these glycoforms are capable of interacting with the immune system, acting as cell antigenic determinants, and raising carbohydrate-specific antibodies production, and therefore they represent attractive targets for vaccine development.",

            "text": "Vaccination has certainly been a key breakthrough in the history of medicine and produced a tremendous impact on health-care systems. It is therefore not surprising that, despite the advent of more and more sophisticated antibiotics, vaccination is still considered by the World Health Organization as the most cost-effective approach for preventing infectious diseases and protecting public health, especially in developing countries. There is however a general concern about carbohydratebased vaccines. Vaccines based on free and purified polysaccharides are poorly immunogenic in infants, in young children (under 2 years of age), in the elderly, and in immunocompromised patients, since they induce only short-lasting antibody responses in adults and fail to generate conventional B cell-mediated immunological memory (Gonzalez-Fernandez et al. 2008; Segal and Pollard 2004) . Polysaccharide-based vaccines thereby possess limited clinical efficacy that has been largely ascribed to the T cell-independent immune response, hallmarked by the exclusive production of low-affinity IgM antibodies and no class switch to highaffinity protective IgG antibodies. This kind of immune response is typically triggered by antigens with polymeric structure composed of multiple repeating units, such as polysaccharides (Mond et al. 1995) . The discovery that the polysaccharide immunogenicity can be strongly enhanced by their conjugation to an immunogenic carrier protein led to the development of glycoconjugate vaccines (Lesinski and Westerink 2001; Weintraub 2003) . This strategy opened a new era in the field of vaccinology. Glycoconjugate antigens are able to induce T cell recruitment and immune memory B cell proliferation, with the production of long-lasting IgG antibodies specifically directed towards the carbohydrate strictly associated to the pathogen (Ada and Isaacs 2003) . The isolation and purification of carbohydrate antigens from their natural sources, and their subsequent manipulation for protein conjugation, are however a challenging task. In addition, the material available is often heterogeneous and not sufficient for the inclusion in a vaccine, and these represent major limitations to further expansion in this field. Hence, the development of cost-effective, fully synthetic carbohydrate vaccines would be of great importance, as witnessed by the spectacular success of the Cuban vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Verez-Bencomo et al. 2004) . Synthetic carbohydrate antigens have, indeed, defined composition, and they can be produced as homogeneous compounds in a controlled manner with little or no batch-to-batch variability, affording highly reproducible biological properties. In addition, some microorganisms express carbohydrate structures that have close similarity to mammalian tissue-specific structures, and this molecular mimicry may induce tolerance by the host's immune system. One approach to evade this immune tolerance is to use a chemically modified version of the carbohydrate, an option available only with the recourse to the chemical synthesis. The unnatural structure will be perceived as a foreign antigen by the host, but at the same time, it should elicit antibodies able to cross-react with the natural glycan expressed on the pathogen cell surface.",

As stated above, the achievement of carbohydrate structures in high purity and quantity from natural sources is a tough and complex process. To overcome these problems, significant efforts have been carried out for the development of chemical and enzymatic synthesis of well-defined oligosaccharides and conjugates (Zhu and Schmidt 2009; Boltje et al. 2009; Fraser-Reid et al. 2008; Kamerling 2007; Wong 2003; Ernst et al. 2000; Nicolaou and Mitchell 2001; Koeller and Wong 2001; Seeberger and Werz 2007; Bertozzi and Kiessling 2001) . The synthesis of carbohydrates is more difficult than the synthesis of the other two major classes of biopolymers (peptides/proteins and nucleotides/DNA and RNA).

To design an ideal one-pot glycosylation, it is important to know the \"relative reactivity\" of a variety of glycosides. In 1999 Wong and coworkers performed a competitive HPLC experiment in order to obtain informations on the reactivity of different glycosyl donors (Zhang et al. 1999) . The study was carried out using STol glycosides (easy to prepare) for their intrinsic characteristics, such as stability during protecting groups manipulations and the possibility to study the reactivity via HPLC due to the presence of an aromatic ring. The relative reactivity values (RRVs) for each thioglycosyl donor were obtained by comparison of peracetylated tolylthiomannoside (RRV = 1.0). In particular, high values of RRV represent donors with high reactivity. The authors revealed interesting trends in the reactivity of thioglycoside donors, in particular: (1) pyranosides show reactivities that differ as a function of the sugar (fucose > galactose > mannose > glucose > sialic acid), (2) the reactivity of amino sugars can be tuned by the N-protecting groups (NHCbz > NHTroc > NHPhth > N 3 > NHAc), (3) the protecting groups greatly influence the reactivity properties (in particular the substitution at C-2 plays a significant role), (4) the position that mostly affects pyranosides reactivity is not always the same for all sugars, (5) the magnitude of any protecting group reactivity effect is influenced by its position on the pyranoside, and (6) influence of leaving group like steric effects (the reactivity of the glycosyl donor can be tuned by changing the size of its leaving group) and electronic effects. In addition, it was found that, for each sugar, conformational effects (torsional effects) and solvent effects may be crucial to determine the RRVs.",

As expected by RRV values, the most reactive monosaccharide provided the less reactive disaccharide by self-condensation, which could react with another monosaccharide providing the trimer. With the three donors in hand (mono-, di-, and trisaccharide), compounds 53-57 were prepared using a mannosyl acceptor bearing a suitable linker. Next the inhibition in the interaction between 2G12 and gp120 was studied using 53-57. Compounds 53 and 57 were the less active, while 54 and 55 showed the highest inhibition values (79 % inhibition at 2.0 nM). Surprisingly, the heptamannose 56 showed a low value of inhibition, probably due to a nonoptimal conformation for 2G12 recognition. More recently, the synthesis of a lipomannan (LM), suitable for vaccine formulation, was developed using a convergent and efficient methodology (Gao and Guo 2013) . Lipomannans (LMs), together with lipoarabinomannans (LAMs), are the major virulent factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the pathogen causing tuberculosis (TB), one of the most life-threatening diseases worldwide (more than two million deaths per year). The LM synthesized in this work is composed by a tetramannose residue and a trisaccharide containing a myoinositol derivative 67 (Scheme 11). The one-pot synthesis of the tetramannose building block 63 was carried out using thioglycoside monosaccharides. Each donor was preactivated with p-TolSOTf (generated from p-TolSCl and AgOTf) at \u00c078 C; then the glycosylation was performed by addition of 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylpyridine (TTBP) as a scavenger for TMSOTf generated during the reaction. Tetramannose 63 was obtained in 39 % overall yield (73 % for each glycosylation step) in a total time of 6 h. Due to the low reactivity of the tetramannose thioglycoside 63, this compound was first converted into trichloroacetimidate 64 and then coupled with the trisaccharide acceptor 65 providing the fully protected LM precursor 66 in 77 % yield. The desired LM compound 67 was obtained after deprotection and derivatization, and its structure was confirmed by NMR and MALDI-TOF analysis. Starting from the fully protected intermediate 66, it is possible to regioselectively introduce a proper linker in order to prepare LM-based vaccine by conjugation with carrier protein or other scaffolds.",

SPOS offers two main advantages: (1) only a single purification by chromatography is needed in most cases at the end of the synthesis and (2) unwanted reagents and side products can be easily removed by washing and filtering. Due to the significant improvements in carbohydrate chemistry, during the past decade, there has been a great development of solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis, confirmed by the numerous contributions reported in the literature (Seeberger and Haase 2000; Seeberger 2001; Danishefsky et al. 1993; Randolph et al. 1995; Rademann and Schmidt 1996; Roussel et al. 2000; Jonke et al. 2006; Nicolaou et al. 1997 Nicolaou et al. , 1998 .

Anchoring sites on the protein can be lateral amines (lysine residues), carboxylic acids (aspartic or glutamic acid), or sulfhydryls (cysteine). On the contrary, attachment sites on the carbohydrate portion can be the intrinsic carbonyl group at the reducing end or aldehyde groups inserted by random periodate oxidation of oligo-or polysaccharides. These random strategies however do not allow an accurate control of the conjugation reaction. Moreover, the precise structure of the carbohydrate portion eliciting the immune response cannot be established a priori, leading to low batch-to-batch reproducibility and difficult characterization of the products. The use of synthetic carbohydrates provided with a suitable linker ending with amino, carboxylic, sulfhydrylic, or olefinic groups ensures to preserve the structural integrity of the saccharide moiety. Examples of chemoselective conjugation of these functional groups are shown in Fig. 2 ). However, care must be taken in the choice of the linker. In particular, it has been shown that these moieties could be highly antigenic and therefore suppress antibody responses to weakly immunogenic saccharide antigens such as self-antigens (Buskas et al. 2004; Costantino et al. 2011) .",

It is based on the ligation promoted by \u03b2-2-(thioacetamide)-glucosamine-O-serine, \u03b2-2-(thioacetamide)-glucosamine-Othreonine, and \u03b2-2-(thioacetamide)-glucosamine-N-asparagine residues, which represent favored handles for subsequent (chemo)enzymatic attachment of more complex glycan epitopes for vaccine preparation (Scheme 21) (Brik et al. 2006 The key aspect is the presence of a bioorthogonal functionality, commonly named \"tag,\" at a specific point in the protein, that allows for a late-stage homogenous glycosylation (Chalker et al. 2011a; Gamblin et al. 2009 ). The tagging can be obtained either by site-selective protein modification or by selective protein tagging. The former approach involves site-specific chemical modification under mild conditions of natural residues, such as cysteine, its elimination product, and dehydroalanine, which are well suited for thiol-ene reaction and Michael addition Lin et al. 2008; Chalker et al. 2011b) . Even more interesting is the selective protein-tagging approach. This methodology relies on the insertion of nonnatural amino acids (UAAs) into proteins by genetically reprogramming the translation cascade in E. coli. Translation has a great intrinsic capacity to be adapted to accommodate new building blocks, since the relationship between the template (mRNA) and the product (polypeptide) is defined by the genetic code, which utilizes aminoacyl-tRNA adapters to establish the map between mRNA and the protein sequence.",

The key enzyme of this pathway was found to be an oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) named PglB, which demonstrated relaxed glycan specificity and the ability to transfer a number of polysaccharides to acceptor proteins containing the extended glycosylation sequence recognition pattern D/EYNXS/T (where X and Y are any amino acids except proline). When E. coli was genetically modified to express the general glycosylation locus, it was established, for the first time, that recombinant glycoproteins could be obtained (Wacker et al. 2002) . These findings were recently translated into a novel approach, named protein glycan coupling technology (PGCT), where selected glycans are coupled to target proteins using an E. coli recombinant system to produce an unlimited and readily purified supply of vast combinations of glycoconjugate vaccine candidates. Moreover, in a more advanced vision, both the glycan and protein syntheses could be triggered inside the E. coli host, avoiding the long multistep synthesis of the glycan and the need of manipulating pathogenic bacteria for protein isolation (Terra et al. 2012) . To this end, the loci encoding the glycan and the target carrier protein (containing the appropriate consensus sequon; otherwise it can be directly engineered (Ihssen et al. 2010 )) have to be cloned and expressed in E. coli, usually on a suitable plasmid. Finally, the coupling enzyme has to recognize the reducing end of the target glycan in order to transfer it to the protein (Fig. 4) .",

            "text": "In addition to the abovementioned problems, another important aspect should also be taken into account when designing glycoconjugate vaccines. Due to the presence of diverse T cell epitopes, carrier proteins are highly immunogenic and therefore elicit strong T cell responses, which can overcome that of the saccharide moiety (especially in the case of very short oligosaccharide fragments) causing hapten suppression (Herzenberg and Tokuhisa 1980) . The use of a single peptide as a T cell epitope should give rise to a more robust immune response, more specifically directed towards the carbohydrate antigen. To address this issue, over the last decade, a number of computer algorithms that map the locations of MHC-restricted T cell epitopes within proteins of various origins have been developed. As a result, it has been found that some sequence regions of protein antigens might sensitize CD4+ cells (Weber et al. 2009 ). This finding led to the identification of small and simple T H peptide epitopes that are chemically defined, easily synthesized by SPPS, and able to generate effective helper T cell responses in humans. Among them, the Pan HLA DR-binding Epitope (PADRE), OVA 323-339 and YAF peptides, TT heptapeptide, and tridecapeptide from poliovirus are widely used (Panina-Bordignon et al. 1989; Diethelm-Okita et al. 1997 . Boons recently developed a tricomponent synthetic anticancer vaccine 116 incorporating the Tn antigen (\u03b1GalNAc) linked to YAF peptide and also containing the immunoadjuvant Pam 3 Cys (Scheme 22) (Ingale et al. 2009 ).",

In living cells, this issue is circumvented by multivalent receptor-ligand interactions, where multiple ligands interact simultaneously with multimeric receptors inducing an increase of the binding affinities of several orders of magnitude (multivalency effect). When this phenomenon is referred to carbohydrate-receptor interactions, it is commonly named \"cluster glycoside effect\" (Lundquist and Toone 2002) . A major goal pursued by the vaccinology research is to reproduce the multivalency effect into fully synthetic systems using polyfunctional scaffolds capable of displaying multiple copies of carbohydrate antigens and that can be univocally characterized from a chemical point of view (mass and NMR spectroscopy). Under this point of view, the traditional glycoconjugate vaccines can be considered as an example of replication of the cluster glycoside effect, since they contain a large number of carbohydrate antigens exposed on the protein surface that are collectively much more immunogenic than the corresponding monovalent forms.",

The name comes from the Greek word \u03b4E \u03bd\u03b4\u03c1o\u03bd (dendron), which translates to \"tree\" (Astruc et al. 2010) . Dendritic molecules are characterized by structural perfection: they are monodisperse and usually highly symmetric around the core, adopting a globular three-dimensional morphology. Dendritic molecules can be categorized into low-molecular weight and high-molecular weight species. The first class includes dendrimers and dendrons, while the latter comprises dendronized polymers, hyperbranched polymers, and polymer brushes. Dendrimers can be considered to have three major portions: a core, an inner shell, and an outer shell. In principle, a dendrimer can bear different functionalities in each of these portions to control properties such as solubility, thermal stability, and attachment of compounds for specific applications. Synthetic processes can also precisely control the size and number of branches on the dendrimer. Such molecules can be assembled following two different approaches. In the divergent method, the dendrimer is assembled from a multifunctional core, which is extended outward by a series of reactions. However, each step must be driven to completion in order to avoid mistakes in the dendrimer, which can cause trailing generations (some branches are shorter than others, Fig. 6a ). On the other hand, in the convergent methods, dendrimers are built from Fig. 6 Outline of convergent and divergent syntheses of dendrimers small molecules that end up at the surface of the sphere, and reactions proceed inward to the center core (Fig. 6b) . This method makes it much easier to remove impurities and shorter branches. However dendrimers made this way cannot be as large as those made by divergent methods because of crowding due to steric effects around the core.",

They proposed a new family of model glycoclusters and glycodendrimers, decorated with N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) termini, that can be assembled through a divergent original \"onion peel strategy.\" High chemo-and regioselective photolytic thiol-ene coupling (TEC) and thiol-yne coupling (TYC) were used to rapidly and sequentially grow the dendritic architectures and to install a high degree of branching (Dondoni and Marra 2012; Gingras et al. 2013) . Further branching (up to 36 valences) was added by EDC-mediated esterifications (or amidations) of polypropargylated dendrons (such as 119), to which the LacNAc azide derivative 120 was attached by \"click chemistry\" (Scheme 25). As far as the biological relevance is concerned, LacNAc represents a part of the Lewis x and Lewis y tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (Heimburg-Molinaro et al. 2011) , and it is known to possess strong binding affinities towards galectins, a cancerassociated family of proteins (Zhou 2003; Liu and Rabinovich 2005; Salatino et al. 2008; Rabinovich and Toscano 2009) . Therefore, a protein binding study was carried out with a model leguminous lectin from Erythrina cristagalli agglutinin (ECA). Interestingly, the glycodendrimers exhibited high relative potencies, with an up to 216-fold enhancement in global affinity with respect to the reference monomer.",

The authors employed a water-soluble and readily available polymer, which is the multi-alkyne-functionalized hyperbranched polyglycerol (hbPG) 121, obtained in a one-step copolymerization of glycidol and its propargyl ether. The scaffold presents a globular shape and a flexible dendrimer-like structure, which allows an optimal antigen presentation to the immune system. Moreover, polyglycerols are suitable as inert carriers for biomedical applications, as they are considered biocompatible and non-immunogenic. A tumorassociated MUC1 glycopeptide combined with the immunostimulating T cell epitope P2 from tetanus toxoid was coupled to the terminal alkyne groups by \"click chemistry\" (Scheme 26). MUC1 is a tumor-associated glycoprotein member of the mucins family, densely glycosylated high molecular weight proteins implicated in a variety of epithelial cancers. Typical TACAs of mucins include Tn, sTn (NeuAc\u03b12-6GalNAc), and TF, \u03b1-O-glycosylated to serine/threonine residues in the peptide backbone (Heimburg-Molinaro et al. 2011; Pashov et al. 2011) . The resulting construct 122 was shown to induce a strong immune response in mice, raising IgG antibodies able to recognize human breast cancer cells.",

Therefore, they represent an attractive target for anticancer vaccine formulation (Pashov et al. 2011; Beatson et al. 2010) . Over the years, considerable efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of glycopeptide assemblies that include either a carrier protein or T cell epitopes in order to induce stronger immunological responses. The major contribution to this field came from Danishefsky and coworkers. They reported the synthesis and immunological evaluation of several multivalent, fully synthetic, glycopeptide-based antitumor vaccines (Ragupathi et al. 2006) . The authors speculated that the combination of several carbohydrate antigens closely associated with a particular cancer type could induce a more robust immune response, decreasing the percentage of tumor cells that can elude an immunological response. The constructs were assembled following a unimolecular multivalent approach, where several distinct TACAs are displayed on a single peptide backbone (Kim and Varki 1997) . A sequential assembly of the glycopeptide in order of carbohydrate size, from the smallest (Tn) to the largest and most complex one (Globo H), was performed. The functionalized carbohydrate antigens were prepared either by manipulation of glycal epoxides or sulfonylaziridines, whereas the spacers were built through Horner-Emmons reactions followed by asymmetric hydrogenation or by cross-metathesis (Fig. 7) . The results coming from mice immunization point out that the immunological properties of the individual antigens are preserved in the multivalent structures. However, it seems also that the immunogenicity is influenced by the position of the antigen on the peptide backbone. Overall, the antibodies showed significant reactivity with all three cell lines tested (MCF-7, LSC, DU-145). These vaccine candidates are now at the stage of evaluation in clinical trials. Another exciting approach was reported by the Li team (Huang et al. 2012 ). They synthesized self-adjuvanting vaccine candidates containing Tn-glycosylated full-length MUC1 VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) domains (Pashov et al. 2011) conjugated to a self-assembled peptide sequence (Q11 domain, Fig. 8 ) (Jung et al. 2009 ). The Q11 domain could aggregate in solution, under mild conditions, into fibers over 200 nm long, thus displaying multivalent B cell epitopes on the fiber surface, and it served both as adjuvant and vaccine carrier (Rudra et al. 2010) . Immunological studies revealed the production of high titers of antibodies capable of recognizing human breast tumor cells.",
