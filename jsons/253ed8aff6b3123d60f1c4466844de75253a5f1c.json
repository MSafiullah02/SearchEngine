            "text": "O n 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) directorgeneral declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a publichealth emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Six weeks later, the outbreak was categorized as a pandemic. COVID-19 has already caused 24 times more cases (as of 18 March 2020) than the previous coronavirus-induced PHEIC-the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak-and the COVID-19 numbers are expected to grow. Compared with the 2002-2003 outbreak, however, the COVID-19 emergency is occurring in a much more digitized and connected world. The amount of data produced from the dawn of humankind through 2003 is generated today within a few minutes. Furthermore, advanced computational models, such as those based on machine learning, have shown great potential in tracing the source or predicting the future spread of infectious diseases 1,2 . It is therefore imperative to leverage big data and intelligent analytics and put them to good use for public health.",

China, the country most affected by COVID-19, is reportedly using ubiquitous sensor data and healthcheck apps to curb the disease spread 7 . According to a New York Times report 8 , there is little transparency in how these data are cross-checked and reused for surveillance purposes. For example, the report said that Alipay Health Code, an Alibaba-backed government-run app that supports decisions about who should be quarantined for COVID-19, also seems to share information with the police 8 . In Italy, the European country recording the largest number of COVID-19 cases, the local data-protection authority was urged, on 2 March 2 2020, to issue a statement to clarify the conditions of lawful data use for mitigation and containment purposes. In its statement, the authority warned against the privacy-infringing collection and processing of data by non-institutional actors (e.g., private employers).",

We argue that the use of digitally available data and algorithms for prediction and surveillancee.g., identifying people who have traveled to areas where the disease has spread or tracing and isolating the contacts of infected people-is of paramount importance in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It is equally important, however, to use these data and algorithms in a responsible manner, in compliance with data-protection regulations and with due respect for privacy and confidentiality. Failing to do so will undermine public trust, which will make people less likely to follow public-health advice or recommendations and more likely to have poorer health outcomes 10 .",

            "text": "Careful data-management practices should govern both data collection and data processing. In the collection of data from affected people, the principle of proportionality should apply, which means that the data collection must (i) be proportional to the seriousness of the public-health threat, (ii) be limited to what is necessary to achieve a specific public-health objective, and (iii) be scientifically justified. Gaining access to data from personal devices for contact tracing purposes, for example, can be justified if it occurs within specific bounds, has a clear purpose-e.g., warning and isolating people who may have been exposed to the virusand no less-invasive alternative-e.g., using anonymized mobile positioning data-is suitable for that purpose. Furthermore, 'do it yourself ' health surveillance, as it was labeled by the Italian data-protection authority, should be avoided. comment At the data-processing level, data quality and security controls are needed. Data-integrity weaknesses, which are common when data from personal digital devices are used, can introduce small errors in one or multiple factors, which in turn can have an outsized effect on largescale predictive models. Furthermore, data breaches, insufficient or ineffective de-identification and biases in datasets can become major causes of distrust in public-health services.",

Requesting or warranting access to personal devices can, for purposes such as contact tracing, be more effective than simply leveraging anonymized mobile positioning data. However, compelling providers to allow access to or even assist in decrypting cryptographically protected data (similar to what occurred during the 2016 US Federal Bureau of Investigation-Apple encryption dispute) may be counterproductive, especially if the agreements between (inter) national authorities and service providers lack transparency or proportion. Similar trade-offs apply to health apps that require users to register with their names or national identification numbers.",

Overriding consent and privacy rights in the name of disease surveillance may fuel distrust and ultimately turn out to be disadvantageous. There have been reports that China's digital epidemic control might have exacerbated stigmatization and public mistrust. This risk of mistrust is even greater in countries in which citizens place a much lower level of trust in their government, such as Italy, France and the USA 11 . Therefore, whenever access to these data sources is required and is deemed proportional, the public should be adequately informed. Secrecy about data access and use should be avoided. Transparent public communication about data processing for the common good should be pursued. Data-processing agreements, for example, should disclose which data are transmitted to third parties and for which purpose.",
