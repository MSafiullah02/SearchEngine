Currently, there are more than 10 members in the human cathepsin family [10]. We are interested in cathepsins H, L and S (CTSH, CTSL and CTSS, respectively), because we observed that these channel catfish cathepsins were induced and up-regulated in the early stage of Edwardsiella ictaluri infection in channel catfish ovary cells (ATCC CRL-2772) [Yeh and Klesius, unpublished data], leading us to speculate that these cathepsins may play critical roles in infection.",

A recent in vitro study demonstrated that CTSL is required for Toll-like receptor 9 responses to microbial DNA [12]. Also, CTSL has been implicated in microbial pathogenesis. Simmon et al. [13] showed that CTSL is needed for cleavage of the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in endosomes for viral entry. Chandran et al. [14] also showed that CTSL plays an assistant role in Ebola virus infection. CTSH (E.C. 3.4.22.16), first isolated from rat liver [15], is a potent lysosomal cysteine aminopeptidase in the cathepsin family [6], [8]. In physiological states, CTSH is required for lung development [16], [17].",

The complete sequences of channel catfish CTSH and CTSL cDNAs consisted of 1415 and 1639 nucleotides, respectively, (GenBank accession numbers EU915298 for CTSH and EU915299 for CTSL). Analysis of both sequences revealed that each had an open reading frame (ORF) with the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTR). Like mammalian mRNA, three feature sequences of mRNA, instability motifs, polyadenylation signal sequences and polyadenylation tails, were found in 3\u2032-UTR of CTSH and CTSL sequences (Sequences not shown).",

Other conserved features in both CTSH and CTSL mature peptides include (denoted as residue number for CTSH/CTSL, respectively): (1) the catalytic triad at Cys134/139, His274/279 and Asn294/303 residues, (2) potential substrate binding sites at Gln128/133, Gly176\u2013177/181\u2013182, Trp296/305 and Trp300/309 residues, and (3) five potential cysteine disulfide linkage sites at 131, 165, 174, 207and 315 in CTSH, and 136, 170, 179, 213, 272 and 325 in CTSL (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n) [31], [33].
