Although the concepts of privacy and confidentiality are closely related, and the two terms are often used interchangeably, several differences between them are worth noting. Privacy is the broader of the two concepts; it has at least four primary uses\u2014physical seclusion, protection of personal information (\u201cinformational privacy\u201d), protection of one's personal identity, and the ability to make choices without interference [4]. In relationship to the notion of physical seclusion, privacy is the right to a zone of personal space, and access to that space is controlled by the person who holds the right to it. Related to this right is the human instinct for modesty\u2014the desire to protect one's intimate body parts (defined differently in various cultures) from being exposed against one's will, consent, or knowledge.",

Confidentiality is synonymous with informational privacy. This article addresses issues of the physical privacy of patients and of the confidentiality of patients' personal information. Decisional privacy, the ability to make and act on one's personal choices (related to the bioethical principle of autonomy), is also an important concept in emergency medicine; it is addressed elsewhere in this issue in the article by Dr. Moskop entitled \u201cInformed Consent and Refusal of Treatment: Challenges for Emergency Physicians.\u201d",

Simply stated, to respect human dignity is to recognize that human beings have special, intrinsic moral worth, and one should act with careful consideration for their interests, goals, and choices. Among the basic interests of individuals are control over one's physical environment, including protection from unwanted intrusion by others into one's personal space, and control over one's personal information, including protection of that information from unwanted disclosure to others. By protecting these basic human interests in physical privacy and confidentiality, physicians show respect for the dignity, autonomy, and well-being of their patients. The nearly universal recognition in medical oaths and codes of ethics of duties to protect patient privacy and confidentiality is a powerful indicator of the moral significance of these concepts.",

Physicians need to know about patient health behaviors and symptoms and need to conduct intimate physical examinations to formulate accurate diagnoses and to provide effective therapy. To disclose sensitive and potentially embarrassing personal information and to permit intimate physical examination, patients must trust that their physicians will keep that information confidential and protect them from any unnecessary or inappropriate bodily exposure. The etymology of the English term confidentiality suggests this expectation because it is derived from the Latin word confidere, \u201cto trust\u201d [6]. By protecting physical privacy and confidentiality, physicians establish a relationship of trust that promotes effective therapy and maximizes patient well-being. This relationship of trust also encourages patients to seek health care, without fear or apprehension, when they need it.",

Instead, moral principles, practical exigencies, and legal rules typically recognize and dictate that, in specific circumstances, privacy or confidentiality may be overridden by even more important moral considerations. Protecting physical privacy and confidentiality are best understood as prima facie duties, that is, duties that must be honored unless there exists a stronger conflicting moral duty [7]. Duties that may conflict with respect for privacy or confidentiality include duties to act expeditiously to provide benefit and protect the patient from harm, to protect third parties, and to obey the law. When prima facie duties conflict in a particular situation, physicians may confront difficult moral judgments about which duty should take precedence; this results in the classic ethical dilemma. To reach a conclusion and resolve the dilemma, physicians must consider the reasons for and against alternative courses of action, such as the magnitude and probability of benefits and harms expected from the different alternatives, and choose the best overall course of action.",

The Talmud explains that the tents of the Jewish people are goodly because they are carefully arranged so that no looks into his neighbor's dwelling [8]. Jewish law asks people to avert their gaze if they see someone engaging in a private activity, even an innocent activity that is not being concealed. The Talmud is replete with even a construction code of sorts that includes specifications on how windows should be placed and how walls between neighbors should be built. Neighbors were to be as careful as possible not to look at each other's activities in their common courtyard.",

Late in the nineteenth century, however, an influential and oft-cited law review article by Warren and Brandeis [10] argued that inherent in the Constitution was a fundamental right of privacy, a right to be left alone in one's person and property. The US Supreme Court eventually recognized the concept of the right of privacy in the mid-twentieth century, when the court inferred a right of privacy from the \u201cpenumbra\u201d of other rights in the constitution (the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, and 14th amendments) protecting persons and property from government intrusion [11]. This right of privacy was seen as limiting the ability of government to regulate medical choices, including reproduction. In this regard, the evolution of the constitutional right of privacy was curtailed late in the twentieth century when the court looked not to this right, but instead looked to the liberty interest of the 14th Amendment's due process clause to delineate the ability to refuse medical interventions [12].",

The ethical dilemma in both situations is whether it is acceptable to breach the confidentiality of patients who do not want these conditions reported in an effort to prevent harm to them or other members of society. Proponents of reporting domestic violence, which is mandatory in a few states, believe that it is justified to stop this scourge and to protect vulnerable victims\u2014either the one in question or a potential different future victim. Proponents who argue for mandatory reporting of seizures do so to limit the dangers of someone having an automobile accident as the result of a seizure, causing serious injuries or death to themselves or others. An argument in common against reporting in both of these situations is that they may discourage people from seeking care when they need it or not being open and honest about their conditions if they do [46]. In the case of domestic violence, victims may fear or actually experience retaliation from abusers. Other unwanted consequences could be family separation, loss of a job, deportation, or other outcomes that may be less acceptable than solutions that could be worked out without police involvement. In the case of seizures, critics of mandatory reporting argue that the risk of having an accident above baseline is minimal, and that the loss of driving privileges that can follow reporting can have severe consequences on someone's life, such as compromised ability to work, loss of independence, social isolation, limited participation in the community, and diminished self-worth [48]. At present, there is no consensus in the ethics community over these two issues. The ACEP has issued a policy statement opposing mandatory reporting laws for domestic violence.",
