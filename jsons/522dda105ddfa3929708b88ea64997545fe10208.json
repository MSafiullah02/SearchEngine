The objective of this study was to characterize pathways through which bronchoscopists may be exposed to infectious agents during bronchoscopy procedures. Aerosol number concentrations (0.2-1 mm aerodynamic diameter) were measured using a P-Trak Ultrafine Particle Counter 8525 and mass concentrations (<10 mm) were measured using a SidePak Personal Aerosol Monitor AM510 near the head of patients during bronchoscopy procedures. Procedure pathway, number of patient coughs, number of suctioning events, number of contacts with different surfaces by the pulmonologist, and the use and doffing of personal protective equipment were recorded by the investigator on a specially designed form. Any pulmonologist performing a bronchoscopy procedure was eligible to participate. A total of 18 procedures were observed. Mean particle number and mass concentrations were not elevated during procedures relative to those measured before or after the procedure, on average, but the concentrations were highly variable, exhibiting high levels periodically. Patients frequently coughed during procedures (median 65 coughs, range: 0-565 coughs), and suctioning was commonly performed (median 6.5 suctioning events, range: 0-42). In all procedures, pulmonologists contacted the patient (mean 22.3 contacts, range: 1-48), bronchoscope (mean 19.4 contacts, range: 1-46), and at least one environmental surface (mean 31.2 contacts, range: 3-62). In the majority of procedures, the participant contacted his or her body or personal protective equipment (PPE), with a mean of 17.3 contacts (range: 4-48).

For most procedures, the mean aerosol concentration measured during the procedure was lower than the mean concentration measured before the procedure, and were similar to those measured after the procedure (Figure 1 ). Paired t-tests found that the mean aerosol concentrations were lower during the procedure than before the procedure, with an average difference of \u00c01608 #/cm 3 (95%CI \u00c02822, \u00c0394) and \u00c00.056 mg/m 3 (95%CI \u00c00.092, \u00c00.019).

To explore the relatively high aerosol concentrations measured before the procedure, the analysis was repeated using only the aerosol concentrations measured over the 4 min prior to the procedure (rather than 20 min), and while this approach led to slightly lower particle number and mass concentrations before the procedure, the inference was the same. Figure 2 displays the change in aerosol number and mass concentration over time for five randomly selected bronchoscopy procedures, with the procedure start times aligned. Periodic peaks are clearly visible in the aerosol number concentration (Figure 2a) , and also occur in the aerosol mass concentration ( Figure  2b ). Note that the high pre-procedure aerosol concentrations present for some procedures (e.g., procedures number 7 and 8) decreased rapidly with the start of the procedure, suggesting that perhaps the ventilation was increased in the procedure room at the time the procedure started or background activity ceased. Patient coughs and suctioning events were too numerous for the procedures shown (Table 1) to explain the large peaks visible in Figure 2 . Table 3 describes characteristics of peak aerosol concentrations measured by both aerosol sampling devices during the procedure. In the absence of an occupational exposure limit or other health-related threshold, two criteria were used to define peaks: (1) the event that the concentration exceeds the mean plus one standard deviation of the concentration measured during a procedure; and (2) the mean plus two standard deviations of the concentration measured during a procedure. On average, the aerosol concentrations exceeded the latter threshold for approximately 2% of the procedure duration, or less than 1 min. Maximum concentrations ranged from 308-8,930 #/cm 3 (mean 4,738 #/cm 3 ) and 0.051-3.22 mg/m 3 (mean 0.545 mg/m 3 ). The two aerosol sampling devices measure particles with different aerodynamic diameters to allow for an examination of how well these measures correlated, which might inform the nature of aerosols generated.

[7] Discussion The aerosol concentrations measured before the bronchoscopy procedures were high relative to the concentrations measured during and after the procedure ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ), which was contrary to the expectation that aerosol concentrations present before the procedure would be similar to, or lower than those, present after the procedure. The reason for the high concentrations before the procedure is unclear, but Figure 2 shows that when the pre-procedure aerosol concentration was high, it decreased during the first minutes of the procedure and the downward trend ceased. Human activity (movement of healthcare personnel into and out of the room, arrival of the patient, or preparation of equipment and supplies) could elevate the particle concentrations before the procedure, and given the pattern observed in Figure 2 , was judged the more likely driver of the phenomenon Table 2 .

Both the number and mass concentration of aerosols were variable during bronchoscopy procedures, exhibiting high concentrations over short durations ( Figure 2 , Table 3 ). In this study, cough and suctioning occurred too frequently to explain each peak (Table 1) . Cough generates polydisperse aerosols, [8] many of which are larger than can be captured by the instruments used in this study. As a result, while our instrumentation was able to detect rapid changes in concentrations of respirable particles, the equipment was unable to detect changes in the concentration of larger \"droplet\" particles that may project onto the facial mucous membranes of healthcare personnel or be inhaled.

[9] This research has shown that healthcare personnel are exposed to high concentrations of respirable and ultrafine aerosols for short-durations during bronchoscopy procedures, and that opportunities for contact transmission exist. Important knowledge gaps remain with respect to the potential for exposure to larger aerosols and the distribution of infectious agents among aerosols of different sizes, and these gaps should be addressed through further field research. Mathematical modeling and quantitative microbial risk assessment can aid with assessing the contributions of different routes of exposures to the risk for occupationally-acquired infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 168, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 169, "end": 171, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 491, "end": 494, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P-Trak SidePak"}, {"text": "Bronchoscopy procedures were not found to increase the mean number or the mass concentration of respirable particles, but short-duration peak exposures during the procedure were observed.

Pulmonologists frequently contact environmental surfaces, which may result in exposures to pathogens through the contact transmission route.
