            "text": "Birth asphyxia is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \u201cthe failure to initiate and sustain breathing at birth\u201d and accounts for one-fourth of neonatal mortality [1]. Each year an estimated 10 million babies require assistance to start breathing. Five to 10 % of babies born in facilities need some degree of resuscitation, like tactile stimulation or airway clearing or positioning. Approximately 3\u20136% requires basic neonatal resuscitation, consisting of certain simple initial steps and assisted ventilation [2]. There is an urgent need for neonatal resuscitation in low-resource settings, where access to intrapartum obstetric care is poor and the incidence, mortality, and burden of long term impairment from intra-partum-related events is very high. Delays in initiating resuscitation may exacerbate hypoxia, and leads to neonatal morbidity and mortality [3, 4]. Evidence showed that risk of death increases by 16% for every 30 s delay in initiating ventilation up to 6 min and every 6% for every minute of delay [5]. Therefore, it is clear that the first minute after birth is critical to reduce neonatal mortality. Furthermore, successful neonatal resuscitation by well \u2013 trained health care providers has a potential to prevent perinatal mortality due to intrapartum related asphyxia [6]. Newborns with birth asphyxia can suffer from short- to long-term neurological complications [7]. Therefore, urgent referral of complicated birth asphyxia cases to higher well specialized facility is mandatory. As per the updated recommendations of American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics -international liaison committee on resuscitation; neonatal resuscitation program requires at least one trained person to be present during delivery [8]. This requires that the healthcare personnel involved need to be abreast with the latest recommendations and should follow them in their clinical practice.",

In low-income countries ineffective resuscitation practices are linked insistently to high neonatal deaths from birth asphyxia in the first24 hours [10]. Besides, poor record\u2013keeping and inconsistent quality of care is a major impediment to efforts aimed at improving the health of neonates. It is suspected that while coverage of institutional delivery services have been increased, the quality of care provided is substandard [9\u201312]. Therefore, this 2016 national Emergency Obstetrics and Newborn Care survey [13] provides a unique opportunity to address the information gap of the capacity of quality of neonatal resuscitation to treat and manage asphyxiated babies. In this analysis, we aimed to explore the factors associated with the neonate\u2019s survival after undergoing neonatal resuscitation.",

The EmONC assessment was a national cross-sectional survey of all public hospitals, health centers and private facilities (higher clinics and above) that provided maternal and newborn health services and reported attending births in the past 12 months. The EmONC assessment did not include health posts or medium and small private clinics because these facilities are not expected to attend deliveries. Of the eligible 4385 facilities in all nine regions and two city administrations in Ethiopia, 3804 facilities were assessed (including 293 hospitals, 3459 health centers and 52 clinics). A total of 11 facilities were not accessible due to political unrest or staff refusal. The survey used 13 questionnaires including 12 health facility assessment modules and one health system assessment module. These were adapted from the Averting Maternal Death and Disability program. A module on newborn complications was designed to collect information on resuscitated babies. Data from registers and birth records for the last 12 months prior to the survey were also extracted. In each facility, the three last eligible charts of resuscitated neonates were reviewed and the highest frequency of chart of resuscitated baby were extracted and enrolled to the analysis. Thus, a total of 555 charts were assessed with regard to the process of NR, provider, facility and resuscitated asphyxiated babies characteristics and neonate\u2019s outcome [13, 14].",

It had a binary outcome: survived or dead. Explanatory variables influencing newborn survival after undergoing NR were measured through the Donabedian domains of structure and process quality indicators from the different literatures in line with our secondary data. The process metrics measured using all steps/ type of NR.

The explanatory variables for neonate\u2019s outcome after NR were characteristics of facilities with asphyxiated baby and characteristics of providers who performed NR. A Bi-variable logistic regression analysis was conducted and those independent variables with p value of \u22640.25 were considered for inclusion in the multivariable logistic regression model with the forward likelihood ratio method. Finally, variables with p < 0.05 in the multivariable analysis were considered to declare statistically significant associations between covariates and neonate\u2019s survival after NR.

Thus, this finding has implications both at the health facility level and the HCP level for the fight against neonatal mortality due to birth asphyxia. Appropriate caring for premature newborns and use of partograph to monitor each woman continuously throughout the duration of labor is very important intervention in low-resource settings as prolonged labor and delay in decision making are important causes of adverse obstetric outcomes. Besides, health facilities should invest more in ensuring that the availability of priority equipment\u2019s for NR to perfectly perform the procedure within the golden minute [16].",

One unit increase in the availability of priority equipment\u2019s in a health facility survival of the neonate increased by 1.24 unit (95% CI: 0.99, 1.54; p = 0.05). This implies the benefit of the preparation of essential equipment, and sometimes staff for unforeseeable and foreseeable resuscitations helps them to start ventilation on time, and increases the chances of a baby surviving after resuscitation. By improving the availability and readiness of NR equipment, Ethiopia can reduce barriers to the proper neonatal resuscitation practice and improve performance that impact to decrease high neonatal mortality in the country [17]. This is supported by evidence from an effective intervention to decrease global neonatal mortality; effective NR could prevent neonatal deaths by 30% as well as improve the outcomes of newborns delivered with birth asphyxia [18]. However, to ensure that newborns benefit from NR, essential equipment, medical supplies, need to be made available and ready at the right place for the right application of the procedure [19]. When health facilities are performing low on the availability and readiness measures for NR service, they cannot meet the practice and quality standards [20] and the potential health benefits of NR practice to newborns becomes compromised.",

This can be explained by the fact that a preterm baby who is failing to establish regular respiration needs more swift support and those babies who are extremely bruised at delivery during resuscitation generally have an extremely poor outcome [23].

Therefore, many facilities did not have any charts and were not included in our analysis of NR process quality and outcomes.
