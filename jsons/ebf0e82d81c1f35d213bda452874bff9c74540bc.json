On March 11 th , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic. In the area of Wuhan, COVID-19 mainly affected male patients (around 60%), with a median age of about 50 years; 40% of patients developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) 5% requiring intensive care. The mortality rate was around 2% [3] [4] . However, Grasselli et al. found that the mortality was 26% in ICU. The death rate was higher among those who were older 5 .",

In a certain percentage of patients, COVID-19 is a viral interstitial pneumonia 8 characterized by fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, and bilateral ground-glass opacities 9 , with about 67% of patients evolving to a severe pneumonia [10] [11] However, preliminary observations reported that COVID-19 patients, compared to conventional ARDS, are characterized by moderate to severe hypoxaemia despite a relatively high pulmonary compliance [12] [13] . A potential mechanism may be loss of hypoxic vasoconstriction, explaining the observed severe hypoxaemia and the effect of very high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on oxygenation not depending on lung recruitment 13 . High levels of PEEP may adjust redistribution of perfusion diverting flow toward high ventilation-perfusion (Va/Q) areas increasing arterial oxygen tension (PaO2); however, over-distension of the healthy lung areas and an increased right cardiac afterload is possible 13 .",

Application of positive pressure to the airway may open collapsed alveoli, increases functional residual capacity and improve the Va/Q match and lung compliance. As a result, oxygenation and respiratory workload improve, with the potential benefit of avoiding intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation 14 .

However, experimental studies of exhaled air dispersion by mannequins have demonstrated greater exhaled air dispersion with conventional low flow nasal cannula at 5 l/min, compared with HFNC 51 . Furthermore, the helmet's ports can be protected with two antimicrobial filters, further reducing air dispersion. This is of utmost importance in cases of infections transmitted by aerosolization, such as COVID-19 41 .",

First, the use of helmet without armpit braces is preferable, although not mandatory, since in the literature it has been reported to be more comfortable 48, 53 . Another important precaution is to prevent the rigid collar from generating skin lesions by direct pressure on skin due to ischemia or shearing forces and mechanical stress to the neck. Interestingly awake patients during hCPAP may assume prone position with minimal assistance. Figure 1 shows one patient switched from supine to prone position using hCPAP and continuous tidal volume measurement using a dedicated software built into a turbine driven ventilator 54 . The application of early sessions of pronation in patients with mild-to-moderate ARDS might improve gas exchange without further increasing PEEP 26-27 . This experimental plan has several strengths. First, a thorough literature review and straight-forward protocol definition will guarantee the best possibilities for the intervention. The experimental treatment has notable possibilities of being effective and helpful, in particular in a setting of mass-casualties happening now in Italy and rest of Europe. Second, the ability to limit the treatment to selected patients may amplify the potential benefits reducing the failure rate. Third, if the combination of hCPAP and prone position reduced the intubation rate, the health care system could improve the allocation of ICU beds, granting better treatment to all patients needing ventilatory assistance.",

CPAP may increase alveolar pressures and resistance in small vessels of the lungs (zone 1) 56 especially in nondependent lung regions, explaining the higher perfusion in dependent parts when the subject is prone. This finding suggests the redistribution of perfusion could improve oxygenation in patients lacking hypoxic vasoconstriction.

            "text": "Prone positionProne position was first described in 1976 in patients with ARDS25 . First, prone position modifies respiratory mechanics. In particular, the ventral chest wall cannot expand, because it is in contact with the firm surface of the bed 26 . I n patients with ARDS, the lung weight increases by 4-5 times, pulmonary tissue becomes stiffer and compliance decreases, in association with compression atelectasis 26-27 . During prone position, decreased chest wall compliance improves the redistribution of lung density from dorsal to ventral areas, and increases lung aeration from ventral to atelectatic dorsal regions, improving gas exchange28 . Nowadays, the application of prone position is recommended in most severely ill patients.Guerin et al.  showed that, in patients with severe ARDS, the application of prolonged (17 hours) prone position sessions for approximately 4 days reduced the absolute mortality risk by 17% and the relative risk by 50%29 . However, other studies have not shown outcome benefits of prone position[30][31][32][33] .",
