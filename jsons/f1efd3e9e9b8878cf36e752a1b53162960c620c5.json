Although intracellular communication is observed throughout the body, nowhere else does this property take on such significance and reach such a level of refinement. Cells of nervous tissue possess an unusual morphology and are highly elongated or branched to maximize cell/cell contacts, and cell membranes reveal a spectacular degree of specialization. The metabolism of these neuro-functional cells is rendered subservient to cell function, and cell division does not occur. It is therefore to be expected that persistent infection by viruses could have a profound effect on cell function. The production of viral proteins and their insertion into cell membranes could disrupt vital processes, and render the cells susceptible to immunological attack. Since neuronal tissue does not divide, cells destroyed either by immune responses or directly by the virus cannot be replaced. Similarly, damage induced in supportive tissue could also affect the neurons and so the function of the CNS as a whole could be impaired. It is the purpose of this review to consider briefly the mechanisms by which viruses may persist in the CNS and to assess the effects of this process. To this end we shall consider events in the human CNS, although results obtained from animal experiments will be discussed where relevant.",

Herpes viruses that most commonly establish persistent infections of the human C N S are herpes simplex (HSV) and varicella zoster. Most data have been gathered concerning HSV persistence in the sensory ganglia, but this virus may also persist in the C N S of and man.',' Both HSV and varicella establish a persistent infection that exhibits occasional reactivation. Virus particles then migrate along peripheral nerve fibers to cause a recurrent infection of tissue served by those nerves. This results in cold sores and mouth ulcers in the case of HSV and shingles in the case of varicella. Animal experiments have shown that virus enters the nervous system through peripheral nerves' and establishes a latent infection in the sensory ganglia. There is no evidence that cells in the ganglion infected with virus actually display any surface antigens recognizable by the immune system, and virus-specific intracellular inclusions cannot be found. However, virus-specific DNA and RNA can be detected by in sifu hybridization,''.'' suggesting that limited virus expression may occur. Persistent virus at this site can be rescued by cultivation of explants in vifro or co-cultivation of this tissue with cells susceptible to herpes virus. Human ganglia cells subjected to this technique did not always respond by induction of infectious virus. However, ganglia that failed to respond were obtained from individuals expressing a strong anti-HSV immune response which suggested that these persons were in fact infected.'* This was confirmed by superinfection experiments in which temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of HSV were used. Virus growth was then observed at the nonpermissive temperature, which was interpreted as the complementation of the ts lesion by viral genetic information residing in the cell of the ganglion, but which was itself defective in some other function.' The \"defectiveness\" of the persistent virus may contribute to the carriage of the virus in the absence of any detectable cytopathic effect. Nondefective virus information is presumably carried in an inactive state or one in which virus replication is so slow as to be undetectable by present techniques. The manner in which this is achieved is a t present unknown and it is also not certain whether the DNA is carried in an integrated or episomal form. However, unlike persistent infections, C N S cells maintained in vifro are nondividing, and therefore virus can be efficiently maintained as an episome in the absence of repli~ation.'~ Papovaviruses that persist in the C N S are associated with the slow virus disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The two viruses so far associated with this condition are J C virus and SV40 PML, which are closely related both serologically and by DNA sequence. J C virus grows very poorly in tissue cultures and this has hampered research. Both viruses can be isolated from PML brain and large numbers of particles can be demonstrated in infected tissue by biochemical or electron microscopic s t~d i e s . '~. '~ Therefore, unlike herpes virus persistence, virus antigens are expressed in the CNS. The majority of PML cases occur following some underlying immunodeficiency. This is also true of virus isolation from extraneural tissue, where successful isolation has only been possible in subjects exhibiting a reduced immune response during pregnancy or immunosuppressive regimes following organ transplantation.I6.\"",

In this case virus persists despite a humoral anti-virus immune response.'' The cell-mediated immune system, however, is tolerized towards the virus and this is thought to provide the basis for virus persistence and the failure to eliminate the infection. The virus replication process may be held in check by the production of DI particles that can be detected in many organs, and whose appearance correlates with the cessation of the acute phase of the disease.26 However, in the rodent, this infection is generalized and there is as yet no evidence for immunological tolerance, or DI particles in the chronic human C N S infection.",

Acute measles is a self-limiting condition controlled by a strong immune response, but involvement of neural tissue is well known. The virus exhibits a marked lymphotropism resulting in a transient hyporesponsiveness during the disease, and it is thought the virus gains access to the C N S either by viremia or inside infected lymphocytes. Virus penetration may result in acute encephalitis, but occasionally a persistent infection is established that leads to a fatal slowly progressing disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). During this condition inclusion bodies are present in the C N S cells that consist of measles virus nu~leocapsids.'~-'~ However, cell fusion that is characteristic of measles virus-induced CPE is not observed, and mature virus particles are absent. However, virus expression may sometimes be rescued from this infected tissue by co-cultivation procedure^.'^ These experiments have therefore confirmed that measles virus is the etiological agent of SSPE and also indicated that virus persistence may be based on some defect in the virus maturation process that could involve some form of host effect. Viruses rescued from SSPE tissue revealed some structural differences from wild-type measles strains. Some of these concern electrophoretic migration differences between measles and SSPE virus polypeptides but the advent of monoclonal antibodies has permitted the detection of more subtle differences in s t r u~t u r e . '~~~~ Many of these concern the matrix (M) proteidg and may arise as a consequence of the acquisition of mutations during persistence.m Indeed this process has been detected in persistent infections in ~i r r o .~' . ~~ Most SSPE viruses grow more poorly than wild-type measles and more readily produce persistent infections in tissue culture. This may be a consequence of the acquisition of mutations, discussed above, and therefore there may be some selection towards a more easily carried virus than during the persistent infection itself. However, none of these mutations seems to be a common characteristic of the persistent measles virus and this suggests that this is a general process. No specific marker has yet been found that differentiates persistent measles viruses from isolates derived from acute measles. Interestingly, many of these mutations involve the M protein\" and this protein has been strongly implicated in the original establishment of the persistent infection of the CNS.",

The failure to produce large amounts of this major structural protein is thought to explain the maturation defect observed in the CNS, conferring a cell-associated phenotype of the virus.

Attempts to rescue SSPE viruses from infected tissue are not always successfulJ6 and occasionally a persistently infected cell line is obtained in which capacity to produce M protein is not r e s t~r e d .~~-~' investigation of these cell lines, known as SSPE cell lines, has shown that in one case failure to produce this protein was accomplished by a defect in translation,\" but in other cases, mRNA was apparently not produced or rapidly degraded.'2 Some evidence suggests the latter mechanism also occurs in human brain (Baczko et al.. in preparation). Since M protein and possibly M protein mRNA are not produced in infected brain, these molecules are presumably subject to no selection pressure. Mutations could be rapidly acquired that might explain the variation observed in matrix proteins whose expression was restored during the rescue of SSPE vir~ses.~' Other mutations could have a more profound effect, either on the ability of a rescued mRNA to function in translation reactions or on the ability of genome RNA to act as template for the production of mRNA itself. in these cases rescue of infectious virus by co-cultivation techniques would be impossible and the cell-associated SSPE virus persistent infections could then result.

'~ Furthermore, polyvalent antiserum can alter the synthesis of intracellular virus polypeptides, a phenomenon termed antibodyinduced antigenic m o d~l a t i o n .~~.~~ This event is also operative in persistently infected tissue c~ltures,~' and could give rise to a virus association in which virus antigen production is apparent.52 This state, once established, is apparently stable in the absence of antiserum. Since it has been suggested that measles virus may enter the C N S inside invading lymphocytes, it is possible that antibody is synthesized within the C N S at the time of invasion. This antibody may then be more active in inducing a modulation process and persistence than in complement-mediated cytolysis because complement is relatively lacking in the CSF. A modulation process such as that described above is operative on all virus polypeptides, reducing the total expression of virus genetic information. Therefore, this event cannot alone account for the situation observed in SSPE where the effect predominantly concerns just one polypeptide. Other factors, perhaps host-specific, may therefore play a role in establishment and maintenance of measles virus persistence. In this connection the finding of measles virus genetic information in the brains of apparently normal individuals by in situ hybridization'* is of interest. Measles virus may be part of the normal human C N S virological fauna, as suggested by Johnson and Carrigan.\" Consequently, SSPE or measles encephalitis might result from those rare instances when the modulation process was incomplete or ineffective. Further study of the involvement of the C N S during normal acute measles, and of virus expression in normal or diseased brain will be necessary to clarify this process.",

Infections range from those truly latent infections, such as HSV, where the virus genome is only poorly, if a t all, expressed to those in which virus replication is complete, and infectious virus is directly reisolable such as in PML, PRP or echovirus infections. Other infections, such as SSPE, reveal an intermediate state of expression, and although virus antigen is present, infectious virus is not produced. In all of these cases the role of the immune system has been stressed. A neuron latently infected with HSV cannot be attacked by the immune system, and the immune system itself may protect SSPE virus-infected cells from cytotoxic events by stripping off virus-specific cell surface markers. It is not known by what mechanism the herpes virus infection is converted to latency. However, suppression of cell-mediated immunity has been successful in precipitating reactivation in animals,60 and patients undergoing HSV recurrence often show an impairment of some aspects of cell-mediated immuni-t~. 6 '~' Thus the immune system may be to some extent instrumental in controlling this process also.",

Indeed Panitch et u I . .~~ have reported such a cross-reaction between measles virus and myelin basic protein (MBP). Secondly, it is possible that virus infection causes the release of C N S tissue antigens that might normally be shielded from the immune system. Alternatively, this release of tissue might mimic the action of adjuvant necessary for the induction of EAE by immunization of experimental animals against CNS tissue. Thirdly, it is possible that virus antigen physically associates with the host membrane antigen, resulting in a complex that is recognizably foreign but must also contain a \"self\" component.",

Although the virus may be directly pathogenic, it seems likely that immunopathological mechanisms are often involved. These reactions are often similar regardless of the virus concerned, for instance PRP and SSPE show clinical and immunological similarities although the mechanisms of persistence seem to be very different. Observations such as these may explain why it has so far been impossible to identify a single viral etiology for multiple sclerosis. It is possible that a variety of agents are capable of stimulating a host-dependent autoimmune process leading to the onset and perpetuation of disease, even in the absence of viral antigens.",

TER MEULEN: The point I want to raise is that in this animal model there are animals that have all viral-specific oligoclonal IgG in the CSF. Later on when they recover, this disappears as in man but then something else occurs, and this has not yet been identified. We can say quite clearly it is not viral. We have to evaluate now whether it's basic myelin protein or another antigen. Certainly, I think it is of interest that the disease process is ongoing and this is reflected by the oligoclonal bands. We can only show this by IgG activity. But it has nothing to do with the virus. I think that's the only point I wanted to make at the present time.",
