            "text": "Infection by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) results in a weak induction of the innate immune response. There are many genes that collectively comprise this response and the extent to which each gene responds to PRRSV infection is unclear and warrants further investigation. To this end, we have utilized real-time PCR using SYBR Green I dye-based detection to quantify transcript abundance of the type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2) and IFN-\u03b2 transcriptional enhanceasome genes. In MARC-145 cells, both IFN\u03b1 and -\u03b2 transcript abundance were unaffected by PRRSV infection. However, stimulation of MARC-145 cells by exogenous double-stranded RNA, resulted in significant increases in transcript abundance of both IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 as well as IFN-\u03b2 enhanceasome components, indicating that a type I IFN response could be induced in these cells. The double-stranded RNA induction of type I IFN transcription was significantly inhibited by dual-exposure with PRRSV. These results suggest that PRRSV infection directly interferes with type I IFN transcriptional activation early in its pathway, at the level of IFN-\u03b2 gene transcription. * Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the causative agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in swine, is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales. Initially described in the U.S.A. in 1987 and called \"mystery swine disease\" or \"blue-ear disease,\" PRRS is a major problem for swine production and is endemic in most swine-producing countries, with the majority of herds persistently infected [23, 25] . PRRS results in both reproductive failure (late-term abortions and stillbirths) in pregnant 2454 L. C. Miller et al.",

Initiation of IFN synthesis typically involves binding of the IFN-\u03b2 gene promoter's positive regulatory domain by specific transcription factors that collectively comprise the transcriptional enhanceasome [6, 18] . These transcription factors include ATF-2/c-Jun (AP-1), NF-\u03baB, and members of the IFN regulatory factors (IRF) family, such as IRF-3 [12, 17, 32, 35] . Viral infection leads to the activation of these transcription factors and subsequently to the synthesis and secretion of IFN-\u03b2. This process triggers a cascade that leads to the secretion of a small subset of IFN-\u03b1 gene products [18] . IFN secretion now primes cells through IFN activated signaling pathways to express IFN-inducible genes, including different members of the IRF family, such as IRF-3 and -7 [3, 11, 34] .",

The amplification conditions of the cyclophilin gene were optimized on the ABI 7700 and a single specific PCR product during both melting curve and electrophoretic analysis was observed. The fidelity of the real-time PCR assay is dependent upon NAC and no-template NTC controls, as well as the experimentally determined coefficients of variation present in the assay. Cyclophilin was used to determine the inter-and intra-assay variability present in the real-time RT-PCR assays by aliquoting cyclophilin-specific primers into six sample wells, three for mock-infected template and three for PRRSV-infected template. Each of the six samples was assayed through 40 cycles and the C T of each reaction determined. The mean intra-assay coefficient of variation for mockinfected samples was 3.53% \u00b1 0.03 and for infected samples was 2.48% \u00b1 0.01. The assays were performed on three separate days and inter-assay coefficient of variation was determined to be 5.21% and 5.41% for mock-infected and infected cyclophilin mRNA abundance, respectively. The results of these experiments provided confidence that our assays would allow the accurate detection of mRNA abundance changes of genes examined. It also demonstrated that cyclophilin mRNA levels were invariant between mock-and PRRSV-infected cells with a calculated relative expression level of 0.98 between the two samples. In addition, cyclophilin levels were analyzed for each experiment performed and found to vary from 0.98 to 1.05, relative to the mock-treated cells. Thus, cyclophilin levels were unchanged as a result of PRRSV infection or exposure of the cells to dsRNA.",

One possible explanation is that the PRRSV IFN interference mechanism is over-activated in these cells due to the continuous induction of type I IFN genes by dsRNA. This overcompensation could result in a decreased abundance of these transcripts. A second explanation is that our assay sensitivity does not permit an accurate quantitation of transcripts when present at extremely low levels. It would be expected that the type I IFN genes would be expressed at low levels, if at all, in un-induced cells. Given that our data is relative to mock-infected cells, which would have low levels of these transcripts present, slight changes in transcript abundance could have large effects if below the assays sensitivity.

            "text": "Our results agree with previous studies showing minimal, if any, IFN-\u03b1 induction by PRRSV infection in vivo [1, 4, 29] . Examining gene expression responses within pigs, or in alveolar macrophages harvested from pigs, presents many challenges. Factors such as inhaled debris, age of pigs, immune status, and the presence of other infectious agents make it difficult to decipher between those effects resulting from PRRSV infection and those resulting from the \"other\" factors. Thus, MARC-145 cells offered a feasible approach to identify PRRSVresponsive (or non-responsive) genes in a controlled, high throughput manner. With this information, we are initiating experiments to examine the type I IFN expression in PRRSV-infected porcine macrophages in a manner that will permit us to distinguish between PRRSV-specific and non-specific (non-PRRSV) responses.",

            "text": "As shown by many examples, interference with the IFN response may contribute significantly to the success of viruses in the interaction with their hosts [15, 24] . Further studies examining additional genes in the type I IFN pathway as well as examining the expressed proteins are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism of PRRSV interference. Experiments employing reverse genetics using the newly developed PRRSV infectious clone [20] will enable the identification of PRRSV proteins involved directly in modulating the host IFN response. Because many cellular factors are involved in IFN signaling, there are multiple locations in the pathway in which a virus can interfere. Identification of these locations and characterization of the interference mechanisms will provide needed information to develop novel strategies to better control PRRSV. One such strategy may be the development of vaccines that, upon delivery, induce a better type I IFN response.",

Cyclophilin mRNA abundance from mock-infected MARC-145 cells was used to normalize treatment groups. Dashed lines indicate significant fold change from the reference gene, cyclophilin, set at a value of 2.0. Statistical analyses were performed on all of the data simultaneously as a group.
