            "text": "During the 25 years since its discovery, AT2R has been implicated in numerous physiological functions with great potential for drug discovery (Paz Ocaranza et al., 2020). AT2R activation by AngII is believed to directly oppose AT1R signaling, mediating vasodilatory effects and reducing blood pressure. In addition, many studies show that AT2R activation by Ang(1-9) and, potentially by Ang(1-7), confers protective, antifibrotic, and anti-inflammatory properties in a variety of tissues including the heart, lung, kidney, and brain (Paz Ocaranza et al., 2020). Intriguingly, these protective peptides are produced by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is exploited as a host factor by SARS and COVID-19 viruses, aggravating lung tissue damage often caused by these dangerous coronavirus infections. While AT2R is more abundant in the fetus and neonate, where it is believed to be involved in vasculature growth and neural development, the receptor retains expression in several adult tissues and is greatly induced in tissues undergoing repair. The initial interest in the protective properties of AT2R arose from clinical studies showing that ARBs can be superior to other antihypertensive drugs in the prevention of stroke, even with no differences in blood pressure, and that one of the protective mechanisms was mediated by AT2R (Th\u00f6ne-Reineke et al., 2006). As such, AT2R-selective ligands, e.g., Ang(1-9) peptide or small molecule agonist C21, are being extensively tested in preclinical studies for acute lung injury and fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and stroke. Notably, AT2R antagonism in the peripheral nervous system also shows promise in potential clinical applications as a treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. Small molecule antagonist EMA401 showed efficacy in treating neuropathic pain in phase II clinical studies (Rice et al., 2014), until the development of this candidate was stopped due to off-target side effects.",

AT2R is believed to bypass canonical G protein- and arrestin-mediated signaling, activating instead downstream effectors such as ERK1/2 and NOS (Porrello et al., 2009). Several other downstream pathways have been suggested, but the mechanistic understanding of AT2R signaling is still far from obvious. Moreover, on the cellular level, a recent discovery implicates AT2R expressed in macrophages, but not in neurons themselves, in neuropathic pain induced by locally released AngII, adding a new twist to the development of AT2R-mediated pain remedies (Shepherd et al., 2018).",

This conformational arrangement was the same for different antagonists and different crystal packing of AT2R and drastically differed from its sibling AT1R, which shows a canonical inactive state with antagonists and canonical active state with agonists.",

This position of helix 8 was corroborated by strong interaction interface with TM5/TM6, as well as with molecular dynamics simulations showing that even when pulled slightly away, helix 8 returned to its blocking position. Furthermore, the AT2R structure with partial agonist derivative of AngII, [Sar1, Ile8]-AngII, was also found in a similar active-like state (Asada et al., 2018), though completely lacking electron density for helix 8 and thus suggesting high conformational flexibility of this helix.",

In general, it shows the same overall active-state conformation as in previous complexes with small molecule antagonists (Zhang et al., 2017) and the partial agonist analog of AngII (Asada et al., 2018) (Figure 1\n). But it also gives insight into what differentiates the full agonist binding in terms of receptor conformation. First of all, the differences at the bottom of the ligand-binding pocket are notable. The terminal Phe8 side chain of AngII (but not Ile8 of the partial agonist or the small molecule antagonist) is pushing Met128 side chain to change conformation where it impinges on Trp269, one of the key residues in the activation mechanism. This reshaped binding pocket may provide a better template for structure-based design of full AT2R agonists, though small molecules like C21 may further adjust the orthosteric pocket.",

Unlike the antagonist-bound conformation, where helix 8 was blocking the intracellular site of G protein binding, or partial agonist structure, where helix 8 was completely unresolved, the new agonist structure reveals helix 8 in the canonical membrane-bound position, where it does not obstruct the intracellular pocket. These observations and comparative analysis of the structure suggest that the AT2R resting state naturally prefers active-like conformation, but with downstream signaling blocked by helix 8; partial agonists partially unblock it by destabilizing the TM6-bound conformation of helix 8, while full agonists further stabilize helix 8 in the membrane-bound state, allowing full downstream signaling. One has to be cautious in jumping to conclusions here, though, as noted by Asada et al., and further studies are needed to confirm that this helix 8 observation is not an artifact of crystal packing.",
