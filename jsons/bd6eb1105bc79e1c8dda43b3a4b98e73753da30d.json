However, despite significant advances in medical science, only a small improvement has occurred since, particularly in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia [1, 2] . Even modern intensive care has only made a small difference to the mortality in patients with severe pneumonia [3, 4] . While the aging population, increased number of patients with severe co-morbid illnesses, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic have certainly contributed to the persistently high mortality rate [2, 5, 6] , apparently healthy, immunocompetent patients continue to die from CAP. Disturbingly, a recent British Thoracic Society study concluded that no available therapy could substantially reduce the mortality rate from severe CAP in young adults [7] .",

Given that most CAP patients die despite microbiological confirmation that they received appropriate antibiotic therapy, the introduction of new antibiotic classes is unlikely to reduce mortality further.

Hydrocortisone had no detectable effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) production in the following 12 h, mortality (only four deaths) or length of stay in the ICU. While not encouraging, the small number of subjects studied (14 received hydrocortisone), the use of only a single dose and the measurement of only a single pro-inflammatory cytokine for only 12 h does not qualify this study to be a definitive statement on the role of corticosteroids in CAP. An important finding of this study was that beta-lactam antibiotics did not result in a significant increase in serum TNF levels, as rapid antigen release due to bacterial lysis has been postulated as a potential cause of deterioration in patients with severe CAP [16] .",

The trial was stopped early after an interim analysis showed a significant mortality benefit in the steroid group (0% vs 30 %, p = 0.009). However, the mortality difference was driven by deaths after day 8 and a high incidence of \"delayed septic shock\". The marked incidence of this scenario has not been seen in any other SCAP study. Significant differences in the percent of patients who received noninvasive ventilation rather than intubation and mechanical ventilation also compromise the data regarding a beneficial effect of steroids on gas exchange. Noninvasive ventilation has been shown by the same group to decrease mortality compared to invasive ventilation [19] . The statistical design of the study led to an early closure of the study, limiting the ability to exclude the possibility that other factors explain the mortality difference. The complete absence of any mortality in the corticosteroid group has also raised significant concerns about potential bias in patient selection and whether either the control or case cohort were truly representative of the general group of patients with severe CAP.",

While 28-day mortality was clearly better in sub-groups of patients who received drotrecogin alpha activated [42] , the subgroup with community-acquired pneumonia drove most of the benefit of the drug [43] , with the greatest reduction in mortality seen with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (RR=0.56; 95 % CI 0.35 -0.88). The availability of rapid urinary antigen detection for S. pneumoniae allows this association to enter clinical decision-making (several references for urinary antigen). Drotrecogin alpha activated appeared to have a greater effect in single organ failure than waiting for multiple ( & two) organ failure but clearly has its greatest benefit in patients who have the highest acuity of illness. Worsening thrombocytopenia, suggestive of early disseminated intravascular coagulation, appears to be another important indicator for patients likely to respond to drotrecogin alpha activated [44] . While different criteria for the administration of drotrecogin alpha activated have been established in different institutions around the world, the presence of pneumonia and shock should prompt physicians to consider its use as early as is possible.",

A study by Ranieri et al. showing a correlation between the level of PEEP and pro-inflammatory cytokine production further supports this approach to protect the 'normal' lung [48] .
