We focus on the human day-to-day activity introduced by commuting to a central place for the social activity. We assume that the community is classified into two subpopulations: commuter and non-commuter, of which the commuter has two phases of the day-to-day activity: private and social. Further we take account of the combination of contact patterns in two phases, making use of mass-action and ratio-dependent types for the infection force. We investigate the dependence of the basic reproduction number on the commuter ratio and the daily expected duration at the social phase as essential factors characterizing the community structure, and show that the dependence is significantly affected by the combination of contact patterns, and that the difference in the commuter ratio could make the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease significantly different.",

            "text": "One of past well-recognized examples of such transportation-related global infection of a transmissible disease, SARS by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus broke out in 2003, beginning with some infection on an airplane (Wang and Wu 2018) . There have been many investigations concerning the effect of transportation (or population dispersal) on the spread of a transmissible disease, and especially conducted been many theoretical/mathematical studies taken account of such a possibility for some individuals to become infective during transportation in order to such an significant contribution of transport-related infection [as a recent review, see Walters et al. (2018) and references therein; especially for the SARS virus transmission, see Wang (2014) ]. Not only the particular transportation with a long travel, but also the human quotidian mobility as a common phase of the human activity can be considered as one of relevant factors that could cause the spread of a transmissible disease such as influenza (WHO 2018) . So is the case of today's spread of COVID-2019 in each local region of every country (ECDC 2020; WHO 2020) . One choice to model such a transport-related infection is to use a disease transmission model based on the well-known patch models, which may be of so-called metapopulation model, described by ordinary differential equations or numerical network dynamics with a geographically divided population (Hethcote 1976; Rvachev and Longini 1985; Sattenspiel and Diez 1995; Herring 1998, 2003; Brauer and van den Driessche 2001; Arino and van den Driessche 2003; Wang and Mulone 2003; Wang and Zhao 2004, 2005; Cui et al. 2006; Keeling et al. 2010; Balcan and Vespignani 2011; Ball et al. 2015; Nakata and R\u00f6st 2015 , and the references therein). In contrast to many of previous mathematical works focusing on the contribution of long-term migration (to cause the change in population size) or the infection during a short-term or mid-term temporal transportation between communities (e.g., the case of SARS) to a certain global scale of transmissible disease spread, we shall focus in this paper on the contribution of human quotidian activity (including only transportations as quotidian commuting) to the spread of transmissible disease within a community.",

At the central place, the commuters make their social activities. Falc\u00f3n-Lezama et al. (2016) considered a very similar situation and analyzed a mathematical model of SEIR type with respect to the dengue epidemic dynamics and its control. Differently from theirs, the principal subject of our analysis about our model is the dependence of the spread of a transmissible disease on the community structure represented by the commuting subpopulation size, and we will try to discuss the community structure to have the smaller risk of the disease spread, that is, to have its higher resistance to the disease spread over the community. However, we shall not intend to make any discussion about the control to realize the smaller risk of the disease spread. This is because we will consider only daily activity characterizing the community Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of a typical structure of the city with residential districts (outskirts) and a central place (downtown) at which the commuters from different residential districts interact to each other in their social activities structure and its contribution to the risk, so that we regard it as very hard to control any factors in such activity closely related to the daily life. Since the nature of such daily activity is gradually changing as the lifestyle becomes modified, we will try to give some arguments about the prospective change in the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease in future, and about the difference in the risk between communities different from each other in their structures.",

The mobility model (1) is the simplest one very popular in the modern theory of metapopulation and epidemic dynamics in a multi-patchy environment with migration process, while it may be regarded as one of so-called mover-stayer model in demographic research, in which the population consists of \"mover\" who changes states over time, and \"stayer\" who does not change states after the initial time. The mover-stayer model is essentially based on a discrete-time stochastic process with two independent Markov chains (Blumen et al. 1955; Spilerman 1972; Vermunt 2004) , in contrast to our time-continuous deterministic model (1) with the system of ordinary differential equations.

The former (S, I ) indicates the commuter at the private phase, and the latter ( S, I ) at the social phase: n = S + I and n = S + I .

Positive parameter \u03c1 is the recovery rate for the infective individual only at the private phase. We do not assume the recovery at the social phase (i.e., in the central place) because it is little likely that the individual might recover from the disease during commuting and acting in the day-to-day routine out of the residential district. Moreover, we do not consider the recovery within one day after the infection, that is, the recovery is assumed to take more than one day. This means that 1/\u03c1 > 1 in the time unit of day, since the value of 1/\u03c1 means the expected duration of the infectivity after the infection. So we shall take the constraint for \u03c1 such that \u03c1 < 1 in the time unit of day. After the recovery, the individual becomes susceptible so as to be possible to get infected again. This means that the epidemic dynamics of our model is of SIS type.

The left numerical result shows the parameter region of (\u03c1, K /\u03ba), identified by the condition (17) with \u03c4 S = 0.4 and \u03c4 I = 0.3. For the upper region with the larger value of K /\u03ba, R 0 takes its extremal minimum for p = p * which is given by (18), while for the lower region with the smaller value of K /\u03ba, it is monotonically decreasing in terms of p with the minimum at p = 1. \u03be * and \u03be * are defined by (20) and (21) (20) and (21), numerically drawn with \u03c4 S = 0.4 for any positive \u03c4 S and \u03c4 I less than 1. We note that \u03be * = \u03be * = (1 \u2212 \u03c4 I )/(2\u03c4 I ) for \u03c4 S = 0, and \u03be * = \u03be * = 0 for \u03c4 S = 1. The reasonable value of \u03c4 I must be in general less than that of \u03c4 S from their meanings in our modeling. Further, \u03be * and \u03be * are monotonically decreasing in terms of \u03c4 S and \u03c4 I as seen in Fig. 7 . Supposing the value of \u03c4 S from 0.3 to 0.4 day (around 7 to 10 hours) as its reasonable value, we have \u03be * \u03c4 I =\u03c4 S from 0.65 to 1.06, and \u03be * \u03c4 I =\u03c4 S from 0.55 to 0.91. When \u03c4 I is near \u03c4 S , that is, when the disease weakly disturbs the day-to-day activity, the width of band [\u03be * , \u03be * ] is rather narrow as indicated by Fig. 7 , so that the existence of p * weakly depends on the recovery rate \u03c1, that is, on the period for recovery 1/\u03c1. In contrast, when the disease seriously disturbs the day-to-day activity and limits the infective individual's day-to-day activity, that is, when \u03c4 I is sufficiently smaller than \u03c4 S , the width of band [\u03be * , \u03be * ] becomes significantly wider as indicated by Fig. 7 . Then for a relatively wide range of the value of K /\u03ba, the existence of p * significantly depends on the period for recovery 1/\u03c1. It should be now remarked that this is the case that both values of \u03be * and \u03be * are relatively large as seen from Fig. 7 . For this reason, when \u03c4 I is sufficiently smaller than \u03c4 S , a sufficiently large value of K /\u03ba is necessary for the existence of such a value p * .",

Actually some statistical data show that the working hours have a general trend to become shorter, as the life style gets modernized while the modern society respects a work-life balance more and more [for a cross-country data, see OECD (2018a)]. Besides, the average value of working hours can be observed significantly depending on the society-specific factors to determine the working pattern and structure, as discussed in Dolton (2017) with respect to the working hours for different countries [for Fig. 13 Contour map in the ( p, \u03c4 S ) space for the value of R 0 given by (13) for each combination of the infection forces given by (9) and (10), the mass-action and the ratio-dependent types: a only mass-action; b mass-action and ratio-dependent; c ratio-dependent and mass-action; d only ratio-dependent infection forces at the private and the social phases respectively. Numerical calculation with N = 100, 000; \u03c4 I = 0.75\u03c4 S ; \u03b2\u03ba = 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ; \u03b2\u03c9 = 0.23; \u03b2 K = 3.45 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ; \u03b2\u03a9 = 0.345; \u03c1 = 0.2; R 00 = 1.15. The filled region in (a) indicates that for R 0 < 1. In each contour map, the value of R 0 tends to increase toward the right-up corner. For the detail, see the main text some other detailed arguments about such factors, see Lee et al. (2007 ), Messenger (2018 , OECD (2018b) ]. Since our main purpose of this paper is to try to discuss the relation of the community structure to the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease, and since such a change in the working hours would modify it, it would be worth while showing some suggestive results about the dependence of R 0 on the duration at the social phase. In our model, the change or the difference of the working hours is reflected to the values of \u03c4 S and \u03c4 I . Figure 13 shows a numerical result about the dependence of R 0 on the duration at the social phase. In the numerical calculation of R 0 , we assumed \u03c4 I = 0.75\u03c4 S . The numerical calculations imply that the basic reproduction number R 0 would have non-trivial dependence on the duration at the social phase. Only when the infection forces are the mass-action type at the private phase and the ratio-dependent type at the social phase, that is of Fig. 13b , the dependence appears simple such that the longer duration at the social phase would make R 0 larger so as to increase the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease.",

For the larger value of the commuter ratio p, there could be a certain intermediate range of the duration at the social phase only in which the basic reproduction number R 0 becomes less than 1. In such a case, the longer or shorter duration at the social phase out of the intermediate range makes R 0 greater than 1. Therefore, it is likely that the decrease of the averaged working hours would make the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease larger in such a community. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 13c , d, when the infection force at the private phase is the ratio-dependent type, there is a case that R 0 becomes larger in a certain range of the duration at the social phase.

In this paper, we considered two types of the formula for the infection force: the mass-action and the ratio-dependent (frequency-dependent). These are frequently used for the population dynamics modeling about the disease spread in a variety of contexts, especially with the system of differential equations. As discussed in Diekmann et al. (2013) , the formula for the infection force should be introduced appropriately for the reasonable modeling about the contact pattern characterized by the transmissible disease considered in each research project. Our analysis of the model in this paper was not for a specific transmissible disease, whereas it gave some theoretical results clearly showing the significant difference depending on the formula for the infection force. This means that the nature of the spread of a transmissible disease in a community significantly depends on the contact pattern characterizing a relation between the community and the disease.",

However, as we did for our model in this paper, some different formulas for the infection force could be appropriate to be introduced in the model as the reasonable modeling, because the contact pattern itself could be regarded as heterogeneous in the community (Britton and Giardina 2016; Yin et al. 2017; Cui et al. 2018; Goeyvaerts et al. 2018) . For this reason, the results about our model with different combinations of the formulas for the infection force demonstrated that such a heterogeneity in the contact pattern could cause a significant difference in the conclusion of an epidemic dynamics, depending on communities different with respect to the characteristics about the contact pattern, for example, as discussed in Keeling et al. (2010) and Balcan and Vespignani (2011) by the network-based numerical models.",

Generally saying, since it is expected that the commuter ratio would be relatively small in the aged community, the social aging could cause a significant change for the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease, not only because of the residents' aging but also because of the change in the community structure in terms of the day-to-day activity.",

It has been investigated as one of the trends and the policies about the modern working style, following the developments in information and communication technologies (ICT) (Eurofound and the International Labour Office 2017; Messenger 2018; Morikawa 2018) . Although the effect of teleworking on the working pattern is open to debate (de Abreu e Silva and Melo 2018a, b), we could expect that it would contribute to the increase of the duration at the private phase defined in this paper.

From Lemma 2, this result immediately leads to the subsequent result that \u03b7 < R 0 for any p > 0. Therefore, \u2202R 0 /\u2202 p > 0 for any p > 0. This result implies Theorem 5.",

Then it is easily found that, under the condition (34), the Eq. (36) has a unique root p * such that 0 < p * < 1, for example, making use of the graphs of both sides of (36). This argument shows that the condition (34) is equivalent to the condition that 0 < p * < 1, as indicated in Corollary 1. Squaring both sides of (36), we can get the quadratic equationIt is easily found that the quadratic equation G(\u03b6 ) = 0 has always two positive roots:. It should be remarked that only one of them satisfies the Eq. (36) because squaring the Eq. (36) ignores the equality of the signs for both sides of it. In fact, from the graphs of both sides of (36), we can find that two roots \u03b6 \u00b1 respectively correspond to the root of following equation:where the double sign corresponds. As a result, we can get the following expression of p * :Then, making use of the following equality, the expression (40) leads to (18) of Corollary 1:The formula of the basic reproduction number for p = p * , that is, R * 0 = R 0 p= p * can be obtained by substituting (18) for (35):which results in (19). Next let us consider the maximum of R 0 , which can be taken when p = 0 or p = 1. Now R 01 := lim p\u21921\u22120 R 0 is given by the larger positive root of the quadratic equation (31) with p = 1. So let us consider the following rescaled values:where eventually R 00 = 1 because of (15) for the mass-action type of infection force.Then the value R 01 is given by the larger positive root of the quadratic equation h(\u03b6 ) := \u03b6 2 \u2212 a 11 \u03b6 + a 01 = 0 withSo R 01 < R 00 = 1 if and only if h(1) > 0 and a 11 /2 < 1. This condition results in (23). Since the condition that R 01 < R 00 = 1 is equivalent to that R 00 < R 01 , we get the result in Theorem 3.",

Thus, from (32), the sign of \u2202R 0 /\u2202 p is equivalent to that of \u03b7 \u2212 R 0 . From the arguments in \"Appendix A\", since the quadratic equation f (x) = 0 has two positive roots, of which the larger gives R 0 , the necessary and sufficient condition for \u03b7 > R 0 is such that f (\u03b7) > 0 and \u03b7 > a 1 /2. Calculating with (42), we haveand find that f (\u03b7) > 0 if and only if \u03b7 > R 00 . Besides, we can easily find that \u03b7 > a 1 /2 if \u03b7 > R 00 . As a result, \u2202R 0 /\u2202 p is positive if and only if \u03b7 > R 00 . This result implies Theorem 4.",
