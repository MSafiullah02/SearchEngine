Indoor environment in transport vehicles is one of the specific environment. Nowadays, transportation vehicles occupy quite an amount of time in our daily life, especially for those who live in big cities. For many people in big cities in industrial countries, spending 2 h in commuting is a daily circumstance. Many studies were done about the environment and exposures in vehicles, and the environment in vehicles was called \u201cin-vehicle microenvironment,\u201d or \u201ctransport microenvironment\u201d sometimes. According to published literature, in-vehicle exposure is generally considered to contribute at least10\u201320% of daily exposure [1].",

The sources of pollutants in-vehicle can be categorized as the same as other indoor environments, including outdoor air, human activity, emission from interior material and furnisher, and biological metabolic process from animals and microbes [1]. Comparison has been done between exposure levels with several commuter modes and roadside exposures (pavement), and different patterns have been reported. Chan et al. compared exposures from different commuting microenvironment in Hong Kong in 1990s. They reported the order of exposure from high to low: private car, the group consisting light bus, bus, tram, and roadside pavement, train, and ferry at last [2]. Moreno et al. reported a similar exposure pattern from commuters in Barcelona in 2015, in which the levels of particulate matters followed a decreasing order of diesel bus, tram, and subway. Besides, the level of CO2 is tripled in subway and buses of the level at pavement [3]. Moreno also reported elevated levels of Mn, Co, Zn, Sr, and Ba within subways and elevated levels of Sb and Cu within buses [3]. Ramos et al. have studied inhalation doses from different commuters in Lisbon in 2015, and reported highest levels of PM 10 in trams, highest levels of PM2.5 in subways, and lowest levels of particulate matters in trains and for pedestrians, considering both concentrations and ventilation rates [4].",

Leung et al. have compared changes in the microbial community in subway cars at peak and non-peak commuting hours, and have reported that the skin-associated genus is largely increased in peak hours; and the abundance of these genera is positively correlated with the level of carbon dioxide [28]. Walker et al. have compared microbiome patterns in subway system across multiple cities, and the differences between cities have been reported [29]. A microbial survey of subway stations by Afshinnekoo et al. has reported that the microbial community from the station can present its history.

Sources of VOCs in the cockpit include jet oil leaked by the engine [40\u201342]. Various chemicals are detected in the cabin environment. Compounds in the turbine and engine oil, tricresyl phosphate are detected in both wipe samples in the aircraft and samples from the HEPA filter [43]. Brominated flame retardants (BFR) have been detected in serum of pilots, cabin crew, and aircraft maintenance workers [44], which are used for fire safety in the air plane. Moreover, compounds originated from hydraulic oil, like dibutylphenyl phosphate and tri-n-butyl phosphate, which are emitted from vehicles on the ground, have been detected in the airplane environment [43]. Levels of VOCs have been evaluated in the cabin environment in Airbus airplanes, and most VOCs are under the detection limit [45]. Studies have reported concentrations of main compounds in the cabins in Airbus airplanes, though in different units: ethanol 593 \u03bcg/m3, acetone 24 \u03bcg/m3, toluene 8 \u03bcg/m3, formaldehyde 5.7\u20137 \u03bcg/m3, acetic acid 6 \u03bcg/m3, and nicotine 2 \u03bcg/m3, acetaldehyde 6.5 \u03bcg/m3, and mostly very low concentrations of other aldehydes [45, 46] (Fig. 6.3).\n",

            "text": "Airborne bacteria exist in the cabin environment, due to passenger activity and high occupant density. The concentration of viable bacteria increases during cruise, possibly due to more frequent passenger and cabin crew activity [47]. A study using cultivating method reports that bacteria measured in the cabin environment include bacteria common on human skin surface or in dust and outdoor air [48]. Fungi levels are low, and the predominating genera include Cladosporium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium [49]. The cultivating method is very practical, but it may lose majority of the species [47]. In recent years, sequencing of 16S rRNA gene is used to identify microbial community in a certain environment. A recent study analyzed bacterial communities in HEPA filters from commercial aircraft cabin, by microarray sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and bio-informatics analysis [50]. The subfamilies detected in airplane cabin include bacteria from human skin, gastrointestinal tracts, respiratory tracts, and bacteria from water and soil. The bacterial composition in aircraft cabin differs from urban outdoor air [50]. Pathogens as well as non-pathogens were detected [50]. A quite recent study on airplane cabin microbial community has reported that microbial diversity varies between flights; airborne microbial communities differ from those on the touch surfaces. And no patterns have been determined for the changes of microbiome community from pre- and post-flight [51]. There are few studies done on fungi levels in aircraft measured by molecular methods. Fu et al. have investigated the level of fungal DNA in the airplane environment, and have reported that the level of fungal DNA in airplanes is as low as 20% of the average level in European classrooms [52]. Microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) have been detected in the airplane cabin in the same study, and the total MVOCs level has been 3.7 times of the average level in Nordic homes. Moreover, two pentanols, 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, had a concentration at 15 and 17 times of the Nordic home level, respectively [52]. Endotoxin has been detected both in air and dust in the airplane cabin, and the mean endotoxin levels in air and settled dust are both higher than the mean levels reported in homes and office buildings [53]. Moreover, 3-hydroxy fatty acids, a marker of endotoxin, can be detected in settled seat dust and carpet dust [53].",

Nowadays pilots spend all time in the cockpit which has a separate ventilation system. However, before the 11th September terrorist attack in 2001, pilots could spend short periods in the forward part of the cabin during cruise, socializing with the cabin attendants. Existing studies on spread of infections in aircraft have mainly focused on transmission among passengers and airline crews. Airborne pathogen transmission was reported to be associated with sitting within two rows of the index person on board during more than 8 h [55]. The transmission is believed to be by large droplets, and increased ventilation rate can decrease the infection risk [55]. Spread of influenza follows previously observed transmission model, but passengers sitting further away than two rows can be infected [55]. Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can occur on board faster and at wider areas than the typical transmission model [56]. One tracing contact study of SARS among 1766 passengers found no spread of SARS [57]. Another study of SARS infection traced 304 passengers and crew with one or two index person on board, and reported 23 infections [56]. The relative risk of passengers sitting within three rows in front of the index person was 3.1 (95% CI: 1.4\u20136.9), compared to passengers seated elsewhere in the cabin [56]. Two tracing contact studies of the swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 from UK and USA have reported an attack rate of 4.3% (95% CI: 1.7\u20136.9%) [58] and 5.2% [59], respectively, among passengers from flights carrying one index passenger, but no crew got infected [59]. The transmission during air travel is a common concern, since it contributes to intercontinental spread of pathogens.",

            "text": "There are not so many studies about indoor air quality in cabins of passenger ships. Some studies reported emissions from ferry or ship engine exhaust, which elevated the level of CO2 and NOx by threefold on average, and the levels of VOCs vary a lot when different kinds of fuel and fuel load were used [63]. Webster and Reynolds reviewed studies on indoor air quality on passenger ships, including effective factors, sources of pollutants, levels of pollutants, and health concerns [64]. The main pollutants from traffic pollution, like NOx, CO, and VOCs have been reported at low level in indoor environment on these ships/ferries, and the indoor air quality is affected by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. According to reported data, the indoor air quality of cabin rooms is relatively stable, while the indoor air condition varies time by time in bars and restaurants, depending on the number of customers. The average temperature and relative air humidity in cabin rooms are 22 \u00b0C and 30%, respectively, and the concentration of CO2 is in the range 600\u2013800 ppm when there is human activity. Moreover, the average temperature and relative air humidity in bars and restaurants are 20 \u00b0C and 40%, respectively, and the concentration of CO2 is in the range 600\u20131500 ppm when there is human activity [65] (Fig. 6.4).\n",

There are usually filters in ventilation system to block particles and microbes, from entering the indoor air on board. However, dirty, old, or damaged filters very often allowed spores of mould passing through and entering the indoor air [65]. Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus have been detected on board passenger ships, which are commonly detected in indoor or outdoor moulds [65]. Aspergillus may cause health problems among people with a weak immune system or lung disease, or in combination with other bacteria or fungi [66].

The airplane cockpit and cabin environment are featured with low relative air humidity, and the cabins with textile seats are concerned with furry pet allergen contaminations. For the passenger ships, microbial contamination has been the main concern. There are lack of health studies of passengers related to in-vehicle exposures for airway and marine transport. Further studies are needed to investigate the health risk factors in in-vehicle environment.",
