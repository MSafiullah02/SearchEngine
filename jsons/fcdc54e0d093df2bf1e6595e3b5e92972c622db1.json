In this study, we examined the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19. Our results showed significant positive effect of DTR on the daily mortality of COVID-19, and a significant negative association between COVID-19 mortality and ambient temperature as well as absolute humidity. The results indicate that the effects of DTR and humidity should also be paid attention when estimating the death causes of COVID-19. Our study demonstrated a negative association between COVID-19 mortality and temperature, while a positive association for DTR. The results are consistent with the other studies. Couple of studies reported that respiratory diseases mortality increased with decreasing temperature (Fallah and Mayvaneh, 2016) , and was strongly associated with low temperature (Dadbakhsh et al., 2017; G\u00f3mez-Acebo et al., 2013; Macfarlane, 1977) . While another study found that both cold and heat effects might have adverse impacts on respiratory mortality (Li et al., 2019) . Otherwise, the study conducted in 30 East Asian cities showed that increased DTR was associated with increased risk of mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Kim et al., 2016) . In the cold season, the cumulative relative risk of nonaccidental, respiratory and cardiovascular death increased at high DTR values in Tabriz (Sharafkhani et al., 2019) . A time-series study conducted in Shanghai about the effect of DTR on daily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality showed that each 1\u00b0C elevation in the 4-day moving average for DTR accounted for 1.25% of increased risk of COPD mortality (Song et al., 2008) . A review for cold exposure and immune function reported that lower temperature may repress the immune function (Shephard and Shek, 1998) . In particular, our previous finding suggested that the phagocytic function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages declined under cold stress in vitro experiment (Luo et al., 2017) . Breathing cold air can lead to bronchial constriction, which may promote susceptibility to pulmonary infection (Martens, 1998) . Additionally, since SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to heat, and high temperature makes it difficult to survive, not to mention the beneficial factors for virus transmission like indoor crowding and poor ventilation in cold days (Bunker et al., 2016) . Also, cold temperature has been discovered to be associated with the reduction of lung function and increases in exacerbations for people with COPD (Donaldson et al., 1999) . DTR represents a stable measure of temperature, which is an indicator of temperature variability to evaluate effects on human health, including mortality and morbidity (Easterling et al., 1997) . Also, abrupt temperature changes may add to the burden of cardiac and respiratory system causing cardiopulmonary events and high DTR levels may be a source of environmental stress (Sharafkhani et al., 2019) . It is said that the windows of inpatient wards were asked to remain open for 24 h a day and avoid using air conditioning in Wuhan hospitals due to ventilation necessity, therefore the indoor variation trend of meteorological factors could be very close to the outdoor environment. Concerning about this condition and our results, it is reasonable to sustain a stable and comfortable environment for the patients during therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 780, "end": 807, "text": "(Fallah and Mayvaneh, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 859, "end": 883, "text": "(Dadbakhsh et al., 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 884, "end": 909, "text": "G\u00f3mez-Acebo et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 910, "end": 927, "text": "Macfarlane, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1057, "text": "(Li et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1251, "text": "(Kim et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1397, "end": 1423, "text": "(Sharafkhani et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1698, "text": "(Song et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1837, "text": "(Shephard and Shek, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1996, "end": 2014, "text": "(Luo et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2128, "end": 2143, "text": "(Martens, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2367, "end": 2388, "text": "(Bunker et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2563, "text": "(Donaldson et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2734, "end": 2759, "text": "(Easterling et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2942, "end": 2968, "text": "(Sharafkhani et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Researchers confirmed that respiratory infection was enhanced during unusually cold and low humidity conditions (Davis et al., 2016a (Davis et al., , 2016b , indicating low humidity might also be an important risk factor for respiratory diseases. A 25-year study found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality, and low-humidity levels might cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms (Barreca, 2012) , similar to a study carried out in the United States (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012) . Consistent to these findings, our results also indicate that the risk of dying from COVID-19 decreases only with absolute humidity increasing. Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread (Lowen et al., 2007) . Moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is efficient under cold, dry conditions (Steel et al., 2011) , and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity ), which may be very similar to coronavirus. Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter. However, many limitations should not be ignored. Firstly, there are some other important factors that may affect the COVID-19 mortality, such as government interventions, medical resources and so on. Therefore, these issues should be examined in future studies. Secondly, ecologic time-series study design was adopted in the study, which might have ecologic fallacy to some degree. Furthermore, it is difficult to obtain the meteorological and air pollution data at the individual level, although the outdoor and indoor air environment might be similar due to the air conditioner off using and window opening for 24 h in the hospital patient wards during COVID-19 therapy.
