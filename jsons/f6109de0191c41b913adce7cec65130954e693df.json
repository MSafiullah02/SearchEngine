Thus, baseline signatures might contribute to identifying interventional targets to be modulated prior to vaccination in order to improve vaccination responses.

            "text": "Vaccines preventing infections or diseases are amongst the most effective life-saving medical interventions in history [1]. In the past, vaccine design was largely empiric. However, this approach has thus far mostly failed to tackle complex infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and Plasmodium sp. (malaria), as well as cancers and other non-communicable diseases. This failure has been attributed to the lack of insight into the underlying mechanisms of how vaccines induce protection, i.e. the rules of immunity [2, 3] . Recent technological advances, including highly multiplexed immune profiling and data-driven computational modeling have raised the prospect of identifying these rules more globally. Application of systems biology to vaccines (or \"systems vaccinology\") involves assessing the molecular and cellular state of the immune system before and after vaccination in a comprehensive and unbiased multi-omic manner ('omics'). This is then used to develop data-driven models to predict post-vaccination, pathogen-specific immune responses (e.g., antigen-specific antibody titers); through these, the goal is to hopefully identify key molecular immune parameters that correlate with, and potentially shape, vaccine responses. This approach has already led to new insights. For instance, correlating the early postvaccination host response to outcome (e.g., antibody responses) has pointed to the hypothesis that the microbiome may be involved in vaccination responses. Indeed, antibiotic induced shifts in the microbiome can influence responses to influenza virus vaccination in mice as well as in humans [4] [5] [6] . This unbiased systems vaccinology approach is increasingly being applied to vaccine design and testing [7] . This has also led to an increasing appreciation of the extensive baseline and response variability in many immune parameters among individuals within a population [8] . Given the pervasive population heterogeneity, being able to predict who might respond to a given vaccine is necessary. Moreover, understanding how immune status prior to vaccination shapes vaccination responses is important. This has recently been thought to be possible for human influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, and malaria vaccination [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Specifically, the aim would be to assess if a subject's immune status prior to vaccination allows a predictive response, i.e. the concept of 'baseline predicts outcome'.",

Put in perspective, the pandemic killed more people in 12 months than HIV-1/AIDS has in the last 35 years.

While great advances have been made in understanding the influenza virus, progress has been slow in understanding how the human immune system prevents and controls influenza virus infection and how to develop better vaccines.

            "text": "The response to influenza virus vaccination can be highly variable across a given population, leaving some individuals without protection, even when the seasonal vaccine matches the circulating influenza viral strains. The change in antibody titers against influenza virus following vaccination is a reasonable correlate of protection (CoP), and is associated with \"intrinsic\" factors such as age [9, 10] , sex [17] , pre-existing antibody titers [9, 10] , and prior vaccination history [18] . However, much of the variance in antibody responses to influenza virus vaccination remains unexplained [10] . Based on studies in twins, genetics seems to only marginally contribute to this heterogeneity in vaccination outcomes in adults, suggesting environmental factors as key drivers [19, 20] . While early systems biology analyses of influenza virus vaccination have identified antibody response predictors, these have been based on postvaccination parameters, such as the magnitude of plasmablast increases on day 7, and changes in blood host-derived transcripts on days 1-3 after vaccination [21, 22] . These observations raised questions on whether baseline determinants of these post-vaccination parameters might exist, ultimately shaping the quality and quantity of antibody responses following vaccination [21, 22] . Searching for this 'root' predictor, both seasonal and the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1)) viral strains were considered within a framework integrating transformed multimodal data sets and natural population variation into computational models designed to predict serologic responses to influenza virus vaccination [10] . Using baseline data alone, independent of age, sex, initial serology, as well as antigen-specificity of the T and B cell populations for vaccine antigens, high versus low human responders could be robustly predicted [10] . The essential parameters contributing to this prediction consisted of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f frequency of a few circulating immune cell subsets (especially B and T cell subpopulations), and these were amongst the most temporally stable within subjects over a period of two months. However, some of these immune cell subpopulations parameters also had the highest betweensubject variation and thus, were likely predictive because they delineated distinct baseline immune states among individuals [10] . Such baseline biomarkers, if robustly validated, are particularly attractive because they might potentially provide relevant information on the timing at which measurement should occur [8] .",

            "text": "Additional evidence for the existence of baseline predictors for influenza virus vaccine responses came from additional studies where peripheral blood na\u00efve helper CD4 + T cell counts and class-switched memory B cell frequencies at time of vaccination correlated with antibody responses to annual trivalent inactivated influenza (TIV) and also following pandemic (p)H1N1 vaccination [23] [24] [25] . Recently, multiple influenza virus vaccination cohorts spanning distinct annual seasons (from the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) and the National Institute of Health (NIH) Center for Human Immunology (CHI)), as well as geographical locations (located in North America) were leveraged to identify baseline transcriptional predictive signatures of antibody responses to influenza virus vaccination [9] . This analysis revealed baseline predictive signatures for younger (< 35 years of age) individuals [9] , similarly to what was observed in the previously identified baseline predictive signatures [10] . Together, signatures emerging from multiple omics approaches (e.g. cell population analyses plus transcriptomics etc.) could potentially capture the inherent biological state of individuals during vaccination more comprehensively. For influenza virus, pre-vaccination host-specific predictive signatures exist beyond those that reflect intrinsic variables such as age and sex, and these predictors likely reflect cumulative effects of the environment, in addition to potentially, a past exposure to influenza virus. However, pre-existing frequencies of antigen-specific B or CD4 + T cells in blood are often not associated with antibody responses to influenza virus vaccination [10, 26, 27] , suggesting that the known baseline predictive signatures may be independent of antigen-specific immunity. Further assessment of these signatures and search of additional predictors in diverse populations will be essential to help guide the development of nextgeneration vaccines that can provide persistent immunity against influenza viral strains, especially under pandemic scenarios (Box 2).",

            "text": "Approximately 30% of the world's population (i.e., about 2 billion persons) have serologic evidence of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection [28] . Each year, approximately 620,000 HBVinfected persons die from chronic liver disease [29] . The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal neonatal/infant HBV immunization, as well as vaccination of adults at risk for HBV infection [30] . All current HBV vaccines are composed of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) and employ a 2-to 4-dose vaccination schedule [31] . The serologic CoP against chronic HBV infection is one of the best-defined for any vaccine, constituting a titer of >10 mIU/mL anti-HBs antibody (defined by the WHO Anti-HBs Reference Preparation) (18, 22) . Indeed, there is a direct correlation between quantitative antibody titers and protection [28] . Some individuals achieve an anti-HBs response of \u226510 mIU/mL after just one or two doses of vaccine [28] ; specifically, 30-50% after 1 dose, and 50-75% after two doses [32] . Unfortunately, persistent non-responders, 5-10% of the vaccinated population, stay unprotected, even after a completed vaccination schedule [29, 33] . Similar to influenza virus vaccination, cell population and transcriptional parameters measured at baseline (i.e. prior to vaccination) might predict HBV vaccine response outcome. Specifically, in adults \u226565 years, higher expression of inflammatory response transcripts and increased frequencies of pro-inflammatory innate immune cells in peripheral blood correlate with lower anti-HBs antibody responses [11] . This was also the case for younger adults aged ~20-50 years, where non-responders showed a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f more activated state of immunity before vaccination compared with responders; this was determined from the increased expression of the granulin precursor gene (GRN) and higher granulocyte numbers in peripheral blood in non-responding young individuals relative to responders [12, 13] . Thus, it might be possible to define at baseline, predictive signatures for subjects generating protective responses following HBV vaccination .",

Decades of research have thus far have only resulted in a single licensed subunit vaccine candidate, the RTS,S/AS01E compound [35] . Despite being recommended by the WHO for pilot implementation studies ongoing in Africa since April 2019, the efficacy of the vaccine against clinical malaria is at best, moderate and of limited duration [35] . At present, it is not known why the RTS,S vaccine only protects a proportion of immunized subjects, specifically 30-55% over one year, and 26-36% with a booster dose over 3-4 years [35] . Vaccines based on liveattenuated Plasmodium falciparum parasites through irradiation [36] or chemoprophylaxis with antimalarial agents [37, 38] are promising alternatives that have shown up to 100% efficacy in small clinical trials in na\u00efve adults [39] . Major knowledge gaps in the development of more effective malaria vaccines are the absence of immune CoP and an understanding of the specific mechanisms of protective immunity. The best correlates for either of these malaria vaccines is the titer of IgG antibodies against the main vaccine antigen (the circumsporozite protein, CSP)thought to prevent liver stage infection and thus, subsequent blood stage infection causing clinical disease [34] . However, unlike the anti-HBs antibody titers following HBV vaccination, the positive predictive value of vaccine-induced IgG titers is too low to be considered a CoP [40] . Of relevance to the concept of determining an immune baseline at the time of vaccination in order to predict vaccine outcomes, peripheral blood monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios at baseline have negatively correlated with RTS,S/AS01 efficacy in a completed, large phase 2b, randomized, prevention clinical trial in 894 African children (primary outcome: frequency of first case of malaria meeting the primary case definition) (NCT00380393) I [14] ; this suggested that baseline proportions of white blood cells might be considered a predictive parameter to assess the response to RTS,S/AS01 vaccination a priori.",

The authors showed that peripheral blood mRNA expression of this TGSig was predictive of influenza virus vaccination responses in three out of four independent US locations over four different vaccination seasons. Gene expression of this TGSig was also predictive of antibody responses to the yellow fever vaccine (YF; a live attenuated virus) given to YF-na\u00efve individuals, further supporting the notion that this particular baseline signature might capture predictive information beyond antigen-specific prior exposure [41] . In the same study, the authors used simultaneous protein and transcriptome analysis (CITE-seq; cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing) of single peripheral blood mononuclear cells from high and low influenza virus vaccination responders (differentiated base on antibody titers produced in response to influenza vaccination). The results revealed a complex network where TGSig expression correlated with the expression of cell cycle/activation and Type I IFN response status in a cellular circuit comprising plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), class-switched B cells and T lymphocytes. This interactive circuit of cells was known to be fully activated only after an immune challenge such as an infection. Yet, healthy high vaccine responders displayed an elevated cell cycle activation status at baseline [41] . The mechanisms that maintain this activated state and restrain full-blown systemic response before vaccination and inflammatory stimulation remain to be determined. However, these results suggest that baseline predictors might potentially be shared across different types of vaccines in both na\u00efve and pre-exposed populations.",

However, larger-scale studies are needed to define and assess such predictors, by integrating simultaneous assessment of genetics, microbiome, intrinsic factors (age, sex etc.), and non-genetic immune status, across different vaccines. While meta-analysis of immune profiling data from heterogenous studies involving different vaccines and populations can be powerful [9] , currently, the data modality shared across most studies is largely limited to blood analysis: transcriptional profiling and/or assessing the frequency of major immune cell populations. Thus, further and robust targeted studies, involving randomized vaccination trials of individuals with or without certain baseline immune signatures, are needed to delineate the extent by which baseline can actually predict and influence outcomes for different types of vaccines.",

Moreover, vaccines themselves can alter immune baseline status and thus, also potentially the outcomes for subsequent vaccinations (Box 3) [42] [43] [44] [45] . For example, the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine is one of the most widely used vaccines worldwide. In addition to providing moderate protection against TB, it can have non-specific (heterologous) immunomodulatory effects beyond the target pathogen (TB), including responses to other vaccines [42] and infections such as Malaria [46] , and possibly even SARS-CoV-2 [47, 48] .",

Further, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is known to affect multiple components of the innate and adaptive immune system [51] and has been associated with enhanced immune responses (higher antibody titers) of young, healthy humans to influenza virus vaccination, relative to non-CMV infected subjects; this, however, has not been observed in older adults, suggesting that the impact of CMV might be age-dependent, an aspect that certainly merits further investigation [52] .

            "text": "It is important to note that increased immune activation at baseline does not always lead to better vaccine responses, likely because the type, quantity, and cellular specificity of the activation matters. For example, an activated immune state in natural killer (NK) cells, proinflammatory monocytes and differentiated T/B cell subsets was associated with reduced responses (lower antibody titers) to the YF vaccine prior to vaccination, in an African population relative to controls [54] . Moreover, this was consistent with the aforementioned studies on HBV vaccination in the elderly, where a more pronounced inflammatory gene expression profile at baseline predicted a poorer response to vaccination relative to those having a less pronounced inflammatory gene expression profile [11] [12] [13] . Furthermore, oral administration of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f immunosuppressant rapamycin has been shown to increase the immune response to influenza virus vaccination (higher antibody response) in older adults, relative to those not having received rapamycin [55] . In addition to rapamycin, other small molecules and biologics with immunomodulatory function such as imiquimod are currently approved for clinical use [56] [57] [58] . Thus, the tools to modulate immune baseline status to potentially improve the outcome of vaccination are already available. Taken together, we posit that based on these observations, modulating baseline to modulate vaccine outcome in a vaccine-and population-dependent manner should be possible [59] (Key Figure, Figure 1 ). This concept is indirectly supported by data from several infectious diseases, where differences in host baseline status at the time of infection may be linked to a different clinical outcome (Box 4).",

This hints at the possibility that acute modulation of the baseline immune status not long before vaccination could alter outcome. The concept of deliberately modulating baseline to improve outcome of vaccination has, however, never been directly assessed. Specifically, while vaccine adjuvants administered simultaneously with vaccines can enhance the response of some vaccines, to our knowledge, the optimal timing of administration of an adjuvant in relation to the vaccine antigen has never been determined. The original choice to combine adjuvant and antigen in one administration has obvious practical benefits in that the number of injections can be reduced. But given that many vaccines require multiple doses to provide protection, the presumed advantage of co-administration of adjuvant and antigen may be small, or even become disadvantageous, if modulating the baseline prior to vaccination ultimately reduces the number of vaccine doses administered. To begin assessing this approach experimentally, one could administer specific approved agents discussed above, such as rapamycin or other vaccines such as BCG, or even alter specific components of the microbiome prior to administration of the vaccine, to then assess vaccination outcomes. It might also be possible determine if better vaccine responses are elicited when adjuvants are administered separately from the antigen in terms of time (before, after vaccination) and/or space (separate routes of administration) . it is obviously also important to assess the safety and reactogenicity of the adjuvant given alone. Of note, this approach may not even require a change in existing vaccine formulations, but rather, the addition of immunomodulators prior to administration of existing vaccine/adjuvant formulations.

Is the differential pathogenesis of Ebola virus infection also due to variations in baseline immune status? If so, could immunomodulators enhance protection, and thus transform those individuals who would have otherwise died from Ebola virus infection to those with asymptomatic infections [67] ? \u2022 HIV-1 infection also has a bell-shaped pathogenesis curve ranging from infected individuals who are rapid progressors, to moderate progressors, to elite controllers [68] . Could baseline predictive signatures for HIV-1 immune responses be identified, leading to novel prevention and control measures? \u2022 This concept is not limited to infectious diseases. While there is an ongoing revolution in cancer immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors, responses are highly variable across patient populations.
