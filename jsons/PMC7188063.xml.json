In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak of COVID-19. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and muscle pain. Severe complications have been reported to occur in 33% of patients with COVID-19 and include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, acute respiratory injury, septic shock, and severe pneumonia.1",

Interestingly, 28.6% of the study patients developed COVID-19 infection while hospitalized which is mainly attributed to the nosocomial transmission. Such findings highlight the importance of implementing strict infection control measures and treating cancer patients in an outpatient setting instead of hospitalization whenever feasible.
