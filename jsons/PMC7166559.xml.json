Most of the previous studies were focused on pathogens (e.g. Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, rotavirus, coronavirus Cryposporidium parvum) that can endanger the newborn (Cho and Yoon, 2014; Gomez and Weese 2017). However, there is increasing evidence that the colonization of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract plays a crucial role in the development of the mucosal immune system and influences the growth and performance of the individual (Schwarzer et al. \n2016; Clavel et al. \n2017). In summary, the evolution of the microbiota has great significance for the health of the newborn.",

First systematic investigations on the development of bacteria in the gut of newborn calves were carried out in the early 1960s (Smith and Crabb 1961; Smith 1965). Although there are some publications dealing with the calf\u2019s intestinal microbiome, there are only a few studies that cover the development within the first week of life (Takino et al. \n2017; Song et al. \n2018). This is surprising, considering that enteric infections in neonatal calves are amongst the major causes of calf mortality during the early stage of life (Bendali et al. \n1999). Moreover, precisely in this period the course is set for the overall development of the calf. Even if the animals survive, negative effects on the subsequent performance (body weight gain, pelvic height growth) of cattle are detectable (Donovan et al. \n1998).",

The highest number of Enterobacteriaceae was found to be 8\u00b79 \u00d7 1010 CFU per g in a sample taken 48 h postpartum. According to Fig. 1c, the maximum viable numbers were detected at 24\u2010h postpartum which remained constant until a reduction was observed on day 7. When Enterobacteriaceae were differentiated judging their ability to utilize lactose, it was noted that lactose\u2010negative bacteria predominated immediately after birth. However, after just 6 h, they only accounted for <20% of all Enterobacteriaceae, dropping to 0\u00b72% after 48 h. Overall, the absolute number of lactose\u2010negative bacteria was relatively low (on average 102 CFU per g). Growing on plate\u2010count agar, most of them were yellow pigmented and were identified by API in about 80% of the investigated colonies as species of the genus Pantoea; occasionally, Pseudomonas, Hafnia, Serratia, Proteus or lactose\u2010negative E. coli were analysed. However, Salmonella were not detected by biochemical and serological methods. All lactose\u2010 and indole\u2010positive, as well as oxidase\u2010negative bacteria, which showed fluorescence on Fluorocult agar, were classified as E. coli. All bacteria that were lactose\u2010negative but otherwise met the above criteria were also identified as E. coli by the API test system. Serological testing of fluorescence\u2010negative bacteria for EHEC was negative in all cases. Figure 2 shows the proportion of E. coli in the average total number of Enterobacteriaceae. While the proportion of E. coli directly after birth was only 33%, it increased within 6 h to 74%, and finally accounted for more than 90% after 48 h.

In fact, there is no doubt that 16S rRNA\u2010based NGS is a powerful tool to investigate the gastrointestinal microbiota. However, NGS studies mostly characterize the composition of the microbiota at the level of Phyla or Genera, and quantitative differences are usually shown as relative abundances. Since an accurate conversion of abundances to cell numbers is still not solved (Bonk et al. \n2018), NGS allows only a limited quantitative statement. The objectives of our study were: (i) to record the kinetics of the culturable microbiota during the first week of life, and (ii) to demonstrate the dynamics of important bacterial groups. For example, by combining quantitative cultural techniques with MALDI\u2010TOF, we gained new detailed insights into the development of dominant Lactobacillus species in new\u2010borne calves (Table 2).",

(2012) also reported a total bacterial count of 1011 CFU per g via qPCR in the colon content of calves at the age of 3 weeks. Likewise, Dowd et al. (2008) detected bacterial counts of up to 1011 CFU per g in faecal samples of adult cows. The number of strict anaerobes (e.g. Clostridium spp.) normally exceeds that of facultative anaerobes (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae) by a factor of 100 (Guarner 2006; Dowd et al. \n2008). This observation coincides with the results of the present study: While the anaerobes continued to increase to an average of 1010 CFU per g faeces until the 7th day after birth, the aerobic bacteria, the enterobacteria and the enterococci decreased statistically significant again to below 109 CFU per g after reaching a peak at 24\u201348 h (P < 0\u00b705). These changes in the population densities might be the result of quorum sensing mechanisms in the microbiota of the gut (Mukherjee and Bassler, 2019). In addition, this reflects the fact that initial colonization with aerobic bacteria contributes to the creation of an anaerobic environment, which eventually leads to the establishment of obligate anaerobes in the intestinal tract (Mackie et al. \n1999; Favier et al. \n2003). The results of the present study are also consistent with Ducluzeau's (1983) statement that the intestinal microbiota of the newborn mammal reaches maximum levels as early as 24 to 48 h after birth. In line with the observations of Smith (1965) on the development of the gastrointestinal microbiota of newborn calves, the counts of the investigated germ groups are also subject to a continuous change up to the 7th day after birth. Molecular biological studies suggest that the calf's bacterial composition changes continuously in the first 3 months after birth (Uyeno et al. \n2010; Alipour et al. \n2018). In view of the heterogeneity in the development of the bacterial counts between the calves, however, the following observations could be made: While there were still remarkable differences in the individual calves' bacterial counts at the first three sampling times (0, 6, 12 h), the quartile distance decreased clearly after 24 h. Evaluating the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts, no differences of the deviations of Q1 and Q3 in relation to the median (Q2) could be determined at the respective measuring points (data not shown). Another situation arises when the distribution of germ counts is considered more differentiated: In the case of Enterobacteriaceae, the differences between Q1 and Q3 in relation to Q2 are greatest at times 6 and 12 h postpartum (Q1/ Q2: 0\u00b7039 and 0\u00b7002, Q3/ Q2: 85\u00b7937 and 5\u00b7000, respectively; e.g. the corresponding 24 h values are 0\u00b7406 and 2\u00b7423, respectively). The values of enterococci were most pronounced between 0 and 12 h postpartum, whereas in lactobacilli it was up to 48 h postpartum (data not shown). This can be interpreted as the beginning of the stabilization of the gut microbiota.",

The maximum value of the anaerobes was 7\u00b78 \u00d7 107 CFU per g faeces in one meconium sample. No relevant data exist for meconium samples of calves. However, this observation coincides with the investigations of Ducluzeau (1983), who had determined bacterial counts between \u2018not detectable\u2019 and up to 108 CFU per g in human meconium. While it has previously been assumed that the gastrointestinal tract of mammalian foetuses is sterile at birth (Mackie et al. \n1999), there is recent evidence that a prenatal transfer of maternal bacteria may occur to the foetus (Jim\u00e9nez et al, \n2005; Jim\u00e9nez et al. \n2008; Alipour et al. \n2018). However, since humans, mice and ruminants have a different placental structure, prenatal germ transmission might be different \u2013 if possible at all. In addition, none of the calves of the present study was born by caesarean section, so that a perinatal germ colonization of the neonate is likely, and a contamination of the samples cannot be completely excluded. Although the faecal samples were stored chilled immediately after collection, it is still possible for some bacteria to grow until the time of the examination (maximum 48 h).",

The lactobacilli, on the other hand, developed more slowly, but continued to increase until the 7th day after birth and finally surpassed the enterococci. The observed bacterial counts and courses of bacterial counts of the present study broadly agree with those of other authors (Smith and Crabb 1961; Smith 1965; Vlkov\u00e1 et al. \n2008). This consistent development of the different bacterial genera could be related to the fact that the pH values of the gastric contents are still relatively high immediately after birth. This promotes the proliferation of bacteria, particularly those of the calf's environment like E. coli and Enterococcus spp., which colonize the small and large intestines in high amounts (Smith 1965). By lowering the gastric pH (approximately on the second day of life), the lactobacilli finally gain a selection advantage because they can grow at lower pH values. These bacteria subsequently become the dominant members of the stomach and small intestine microbiota, but also colonize the colon (Smith 1965). At the age of 20 weeks, the lactobacilli finally represent the dominant bacterial genus in all intestinal compartments, including caecum and colon (Vlkova et al. \n2006).",

A similar course results when comparing E. coli (which represents the major part of the lactose\u2010positive Enterobacteriaceae in the present study) with other enterobacteria. The lactose\u2010negative enterobacteria detected during the first sampling times were mostly germs of the genera Pantoea, followed by Hafnia and Serratia. As Pantoea spp., especially P. agglomerans, are associated with plants (Dutkiewicz et al. \n2016), we presume primarily a contamination from the farm environment. Especially in newborns, allochthonous bacterial species can be detected, which normally occur in habitats other than the gastrointestinal tract (Mackie et al. \n1999). Therefore, the identified lactose\u2010negative enterobacteria of the present study might only be intestinal passersby. The species identification of enterococci showed that both E. faecalis and representatives of the E. nonfaecalis/nonfaecium group could be detected regularly and in high numbers in the faeces of healthy calves. The occurrence of enterococci in the faeces of calves is well documented (Devriese et al. \n1992). However, no data on their developmental kinetics \u2013 especially E. faecalis and E. faecium \u2013\u2010 in the faeces of newborn calf are available in the literature. It is noteworthy that E. faecium, a species which is used as a probiotic for calves, could only be found infrequently and in low counts in our study, where only healthy calves were included.",

The predominant number of isolates (2039 out of 2388) could be identified as Lactobacillus spp). As confirmed by Gram staining, LAMVAB agar also allowed the growth of cocci which were identified as Leuconostoc spp., Lactococcus spp. and Pediococcus spp. by MALDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS analysis (Table 1). Particularly frequently, isolates of the early sampling times could not be assigned to any species, presumably because there were no corresponding entries in the database of the MALDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS device. Especially with regard to the question, which bacteria play a central role as primary settler, a further species analysis (preferably with molecular biological methods) would be extremely interesting. The development of the individual Lactobacillus spp. is subject to considerable variations. At the sampling times 0 and 6 h, L. brevis and L. plantarum were detected most frequently, but were outnumbered by other Lactobacillus species as early as 12 h postpartum. L. paracasei dominates at 12 and 24 h, but is replaced by L. murinus and L. reuteri after 48 h. Finally, on the 7th day after birth, the number of L. reuteri exceeds the number of all other detected lactobacilli species significantly (P < 0\u00b705). The investigation of newborn piglets showed that the lactobacilli population is undergoing a continuous change and that the dominant Lactobacillus type is changing within the first week of life (Tannock 2001). Studies on lactobacilli populations of calves are rare. Soto et al. (2010) found L. salivarius as being the dominant species in six young calves (without a specification of age), while Busconi et al. (2008)) identified L. mucosae in two 65\u2010day\u2010old animals. In the present study, L. salivarius and L. mucosae were also detected within the first week of life (Table 2). However, our results demonstrate that L. reuteri is the dominant Lactobacillus sp. in the faeces of calves in the second half of the first week of life. This fact seems to be very important for the calf\u2019s intestinal health as L. reuteri showed in vitro bactericidal effects against Shigella sp., enterovirulent E. coli and Vibrio cholerae (Li\u00e9vin\u2010Le Moal and Servin 2014), as well as anti\u2010infective activities against rotavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum (Alak et al. \n1997; Seo et al. \n2010).",
