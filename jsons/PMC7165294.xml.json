The causative pathogen was rapidly identified as a novel \u03b2-coronavirus, which has since been formally named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. According to the World Health Organization coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report and the daily report of the National Health Commission of China, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 has so far caused 462,684 confirmed cases (81,968 cases in China, including 11,977 severe cases), and 20,834 deaths (3,293 deaths in China) in the world by March 26th, 2020 [1,2]. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been recently named as the COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Previous studies about the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have shown that patients with COVID-19 may develop either mild or severe symptoms of acute respiratory infection, with the mild case patients showing symptoms of fever, dry cough, fatigue, abnormal chest CT findings but with a good prognosis [3,4]. In contrast, some patients develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure, with death rates ranging from between 4\u20223% to 15% according to different study reports [3,5].",

Recent studies have also reported decreases in the counts of lymphocytes (e.g. CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell) in the peripheral blood and increases in serum inflammatory cytokine levels (e.g. IL-6) in COVID-19 patients [5,[8], [9], [10]]. However, it has remained largely unclear in the kinetics of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines change in the peripheral blood during COVID-19. In this study, we longitudinally characterized the changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines profiles in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients with distinct disease severities.",

A total of 14 (35%) patients in both groups had underlying chronic medical conditions, including diabetes (6 [15%]), hypertension (6 [15%]), pituitary adenoma (2 [5%]), thyroid disease (2 [5%]) and tumor disease (2 [5%]). Four severe patients had mixed fungal infection and 1 severe patient had a mixed bacterial infection (Table 1). All severe patients and 85\u20222% of the mild patients had fever, while no significant difference in the degrees of temperature was observed between the two groups (Table 1). The severe patients showed significantly higher frequencies in the occurrence of sputum production, myalgia and nausea.

No significant differences in the serum levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM), complement C3 or C4 were observed between the two groups (Table 2). We also analyzed the impact of methylprednisolone treatment on the lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, as well as other cytokine levels. The results showed that patients with methylprednisolone treatment had higher lymphocyte counts, lower neutrophil counts, NLR, N8R and serum IL-6 levels than patients without methylprednisolone treatment.

As shown in Table 2, the absolute counts of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of the severe patients was significantly lower, while the absolute counts of total white blood cells (WBCs) and neutrophils were significantly higher than those of the mild patients at the time of hospital admission. No significant difference in monocyte counts was observed between the two groups (Table 2). Next, we analyzed the kinetic changes of WBCs, neutrophils and monocytes as well as different lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients from the disease onset to at least 16 days later. The three mortalities in the severe group were excluded from the analysis due to the lack of kinetic data. Significant increases in total WBCs counts in the severe group were only observed at the time point of onset (within 3 days) but not during the following period of disease progression compared to the mild group (Figure 1\na). Significant increases in the neutrophil counts of the severe group were observed not only at the time point of disease onset, but also at 13-15 days later compared to the mild group (Figure 1b). In contrast, a sustained decrease in the lymphocyte counts of the severe group was observed compared to those of the mild patients. The difference was significant at the time point of disease onset and became even greater on 4-6 days later (Figure 1c). From 7-15 days after disease onset, the lymphocyte counts gradually increased in the severe group, and reached a comparable level to that of the mild patients at 16 days after disease onset (Figure 1c). No significant differences in monocyte counts were observed between the two groups during the whole observation period (Figure 1d). There were 4 patients co-infected with fungi in the severe case group. To examine the impact of fungal infection on the results, we performed the analyses by excluding the data of the 4 cases with fungal co-infections from the severe patient group, and similar kinetic changes of different subsets of PBMCs were observed when these 4 cases were excluded. Total WBCs counts in the severe group significantly increased at the time point of onset (within 3 days) but not during the following period of disease progression compared to the mild group (Figure S4a). Significant increases in the neutrophil counts of the severe group were observed only at the time point of disease onset (Figure S4b).

Therefore, we further characterized the kinetic changes of inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, in the serum of our patient cohort. Fluctuations in the serum levels of these cytokines in the mild patient group were minor. In contrast, the severe patient group showed more significant fluctuations in the serum levels of these cytokines (Figure 3\n). All examined cytokines, except IL-6, reached their peak levels in the serum at 3-6 days after disease onset (Figure 3). Both IL-6 and IL-10 levels showed sustained increases in the severe group compared to the mild group (Figure 3a and 3b). Reductions in serum IL-6 levels in the severe group started at 16 days after disease onset, and IL-10 levels were lowest at 13 days after disease onset (Figure 3a and b). Significant increases in serum IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in the severe group were only observed at 4-6 days after disease onset (Figure 3c and f). No significant differences in IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were observed between the two groups during the whole course of the disease (Figure 3d and e). All examined cytokines reached similar levels between the severe and mild patient groups at 16 days after disease onset (Figure 3). We observed higher CRP levels in the severe group than the mild group at most time points; however, the differences were not significant (Figure S6). Moreover, we also performed the analyses by excluding the 4 patients with fungal co-infections from the severe patient group. We observed that both IL-6 and IL-10 levels showed sustained increases in the severe group compared to the mild group (Figure S3a and S3b). Significant increases in serum IFN-\u03b3 levels in the severe group were only observed at 4-6 days after disease onset (Figure S3f). No significant differences in IL-2, IL4 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were observed between the two groups during the whole course of the disease (Figure S3c, 3d and 3e).",

PCA was firstly performed by R package \u201cfactoextra\u201d to identify correlated variables for distinguishing severe patients from mild patients (Figure 4\na). Four most contributing variables, neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil counts (NEC) and white blood cells counts (WBCC) were selected as potential prognostic factors for further detailed statistical analysis. To assess the diagnostic value of these four selected parameters, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under ROC curve (AUC) were calculated by R package \u201cpROC\u201d (Figure 4b). The results of this analysis identified N8R with a higher AUC (0\u202294) than NLR (0\u202293), NE (0\u202291) and WBC (0\u202285) (Figure 4b). Simultaneously, the cutoff values were calculated from the ROC curves, with a value of 21\u20229 for N8R (Specificity: 92\u20226%, Sensitivity: 84\u20226%), 5\u20220 for NLR (96\u20223%, 84\u20226%), 3\u20222 for NE (81\u20225%, 84\u20226%) and 4\u20223 for WBC (74\u20221%, 84\u20226%). The further univariate analysis including the four factors of N8R>21\u20229, NLR>5\u20220, NE>3\u20222 and WBC>4\u20223 were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs). The results were obtained for NLR (OR: 143, 95% Cl: 11\u202272-1745\u20223), N8R (OR: 68\u202275, 95% Cl: 8\u202255-552\u202268), NE (OR: 22, 95% Cl: 3\u2022646-132\u2022735) and WBC (OR: 55, 95% Cl: 6\u2022779-446\u202223) within our patient cohort were selected as predictive factors for severe COVID-19. We also performed a 5-fold cross-validation in all patients by using univariate logistic regression for each variable. The average of the AUC and the standard deviation are listed below: N8R: 0\u2022908\u00b10\u2022145, NLR: 0\u2022935\u00b10\u2022093, WBCC: 0\u2022868\u00b10\u2022141, NEC: 0\u2022828\u00b10\u2022198. The predictive performances of N8R and NLR were still significant when fungal co-infection cases were excluded from the group (Figure S2b).",

Although the majority of the patients did not have an exposure history to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the clinical characteristics of these patients are very similar to those reported in previous studies [3,5,11]. In severe patients, the ages as well as the proportion of underlying diseases are higher, and co-infection also occurs. Recent reports show that the lymphocyte counts are normal in COVID-19 patients with mild diseases. In contrast, 63%-70\u20223% of patients with severe diseases have lymphopenia and the lymphocyte counts in patients with a mortal outcome remain at a low level [5,11]. Our study also confirmed higher rates of developing lymphopenia in severe patients than in mild patients (84\u20226% vs 44\u20224%). Recent studies reported that the SARS-CoV-2 infection may primarily affect T lymphocytes particularly CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, which might be highly involved in the pathological process of COVID-19 [10]. We also found that the development of lymphopenia in severe patients was mainly related to the significantly decreased absolute counts of T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, but not to the absolute counts of B cells and NK cells. The decrease of T cells in the severe patient group reached its peak within the first week during the disease course, and then T cell numbers gradually increased during the second week and recovered to a comparable level to that of the mild patient group in the third week. All the severe patients included in our study survived the disease, and thus we speculate this course is associated with a favorable outcome in severe COVID-19 patients.",

Our results also demonstrate that severe COVID-19 patients have higher concentrations of IL6, IL10, IL2 and IFN-\u03b3 in the serum than mild cases, suggesting that the magnitude of cytokine storm is associated with the disease severity. Additionally, T cells are important for dampening overactive innate immune responses during viral infection [15,16]. Thus, a loss of T cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in aggravated inflammatory responses, while a restoration of T cell numbers may alleviate them. In line with this hypothesis, we observed that the kinetic changes of T cell counts are reversely correlated with the kinetic changes of most examined cytokine levels in the peripheral blood in severe COVID-19 patients. While T cell counts drop to their lowest levels at 4-6 days after disease onset, serum IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels reach their peaks. The courses of restoring T cell numbers are associated with decreases of serum IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels.",

A recent study in a 61-patient cohort reported that the NLR was the most useful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19 [17], and immunological markers (e.g. CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, NLR) tend to be an independent predictor for COVID-19 severity and treatment efficacy [9,18]. The severity of pathological injury during SARS or MERS correlates with the extensive infiltration of neutrophils in the lung and increased neutrophil numbers in the peripheral blood [19]. Thus, the magnitude of increase in neutrophil counts may suggest the intensity of inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients. Besides, the magnitude of the decrease in lymphocyte counts also indicates the extent of the impairment of immune system by the viral infection. Therefore, NLR may serve as a useful factor to reflect the intensity of imbalance of inflammation and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we also screened the potential prognostic factors affecting the incidence of severe illness in our patient cohort. Based on our findings with analyzing lymphocyte subsets, we further included the ratio of neutrophils to different lymphocyte subsets as parameters. Our kinetic analysis revealed that CD8+ T cells are the major lymphocyte subset which decreases in cell numbers during COVID-19. In line with this finding, our results demonstrate that N8R has a comparable performance with NLR in the ROC curve analysis, and both N8R and NLR may serve as powerful factors for predicting the severe illness incidence in COVID patients.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to describe the kinetic changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we identified N8R and NLR as powerful prognostic factors for the early identification of severe COVID-19 cases. This work may help to achieve a better understanding of immune function disorder as well as immunopathogenesis during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and help physicians to provide timely intervention for COVID-19.",
