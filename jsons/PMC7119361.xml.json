In one study, 173 patients had a mean of 1\u00b73 exacerbations per year (range 0\u20139\u00b76).7 Prevention or attenuation of the severity of exacerbations is an important goal in the management of stable COPD. Education of patients, the stopping of smoking, pulmonary rehabilitation, nutrition, and early medical intervention when symptoms worsen all help to prevent exacerbations. The value of pneumococcal vaccine in COPD is still debatable, but influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are recommended and widely used to decrease the frequency of exacerbations. No convincing data support the chronic or intermittent use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent exacerbations. Chemoprophylaxis with amantadine should, however, be considered for unvaccinated patients during periods of high risk of contracting influenza A infection.8\n",

A 6-month trial suggested that inhaled fluticasone may have a role in the long-term treatment of COPD.9 Future studies are needed to confirm this finding, but patients with exacerbations had moderate to severe exacerbations 86% of the time on placebo but only 60% of the time on inhaled fluticasone. Another approach has been the use of the immunostimulating bacterial extract, OM-85 BV.10 Patients with stable COPD who were treated with the bacterial extract had the same frequency of exacerbatons as those on placebo but required less than half as many hospital days over the 6-month trial. The risk of being admitted to hospital for a respiratory problem was 30% lower in the group on OM-85 BV than in the group on placebo. The alteration of mucus production also has been used to try to prevent or attenuate exacerbations. A 6-month trial showed that once-daily treatment with a carbocysteine lysine salt significantly decreased the frequency of exacerbations.11 Carbocysteine is thought to alter mucus production by stimulating sialyl-transferase activity in mucus-secreting cells. Although the drop-out rate for patients was notable, analysis by intention to treat showed that 70% of treated patients were free from exacerbations during the trial compared with 54% of those receiving placebo. Finally, as an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine may also have prophylactic value in decreasing the frequency of exacerbations.12\n",

In some cases, however, cough may be so ineffective because of severe airway obstruction that increased sputum production is not apparent. In initial assessment of COPD patients with respiratory deterioration, clinicians should look for evidence of comorbid disorders causing or contributing to respiratory deterioraton, and review medications such as sedatives or \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists. Finally, acute exacerbations of COPD are only one of many causes of a cough-phlegm syndrome (others include postnasal-drip syndrome, sinusitis, asthma, and gastro-oesophageal-reflux disease), and, therefore, increased cough or sputum production alone in a patient with COPD may not indicate an exacerbation.13\n",

On physical assessment, particular attention should be paid to changes in mental status, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and paradoxical abdominal breathing, since any of these findings suggests respiratory failure. Arterial blood gases are also an important assessment tool, but exact values of arterial partial pressures of oxygen (PO2) and carbon dioxide (PCO2) do not define acute respiratory failure since patients with COPD have various baseline values. Instead, changes must be interpreted relative to baseline values and in conjunction with symptoms. Generally, however, an arterial PO2 of less than 7\u00b73 kPa or a PCO2 of more than 6\u00b77 kPa with an accompanying acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis, show acute respiratory failure and are clear indications for admisson to hospital. In the absence of acute respiratory failure, admission to hospital should be judged on ability to manage daily activity at home, the speed of worsening symptoms or gas exchange abnormalities, response to initial therapy, the patient's home setting, access to follow-up, and the severity of the patient's baseline airway obstruction.2, 3, 6 Unlike assessment of asthmatics, the role of spirometry or peak-flow measurements to assess the need for emergency admission to hospital has not been established. Most studies have found a poor correlation between spirometric values alone and successful discharge from the emergency room.14, 15 The potential application of spirometric measurements in the acute setting is an important issue because lack of specific criteria for admission undoubtedly contribute to the fact that at least 17\u201328% of COPD patients discharged from emergency departments ultimately require admission to hospital.14, 16\n",

The major bacterial organisms that have been associated with exacerbations are Haemophilis influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis.19\nMycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae may play a part.19, 22 Evidence also suggests that during acute exacerbations in patients with a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 35% or less predicted, gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas, spp play an important part in acute exacerbations.23\n",

A meta-analysis of nine studies showed a small overall benefit with antibiotic treatment for COPD exacerbations.24 The largest study included 362 exacerbations in 173 outpatients.7 Compared with placebo, the rate of symptom resolution and improvement of peak expiratory flow during exacerbations was slightly but significantly faster when patients were treated with co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin, or doxycycline. For example, when patients received no antibiotics, mean peak expiratory flow increased from 190 L/min to 210 L/min in 9 days. When these antibiotics were used during exacerbations, the same improvement in peak expiratory flow was seen in only 6 days. More importantly, treatment failures, defined by respiratory deterioration, were nearly twice as likely in the placebo group. Benefit from antibiotics was most evident for patients with the most symptoms (dyspnoea, increased sputum volume, and sputum purulence) and there was a trend in the favour of antibiotics when corticosteroids were used.",

Many clinicians use antibiotics to treat exacerbations, especially when patients have at least two of increased dyspnoea, increased sputum volume, and sputum purulence.7 For patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD, the rationale for antibiotic treatment is that: antibiotics are most helpful in patients with the worst symptoms; antibiotics substantially decrease rate of treatment failures when patients have little margin for respiratory deterioration; slightly increaase the rate of recovery; the risks of side-effects from antibiotics are low; and an aetiological role for bacteria in individual cases cannot be excluded. Inexpensive antibiotics, amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole, or doxycycline, are generally selected for treatment of outpatients. If resistant organisms are suspected or when the severity of the patient's clinical condition puts them at high-risk of treatment failure, a second or third generation cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, newer macrolide, or broad-spectrum penicillin may be preferred.23, 25, 26 Studies are needed to select patients who will benefit from antibiotics, show optimum antibiotic choices given local and changing resistance patterns, establish the duration of antibiotic therapy, and test the hypothesis that recurrent infections have a role in progression of COPD.",

One study showed that severely obstructed patients treated with intravenous methylprednisolone had more rapid improvement of FEV1 over the first 72 h of a stay in hospital than patients not given corticosteroids.28 The absolute differences between the groups were small, with increases in FEV1 of about 0\u00b7240 mL in the methylprednisolone group and only 0\u00b7135 mL in the placebo group. The study did show, however, that 12 of 22 patients who received methylprednisolone had more than a 40% improvement in FEV1 after 72 h, but only three out of 21 patients on placebo had similar improvements. Another study of 27 outpatients assessed the effects of corticosteroids on exacerbations of COPD and found that corticosteroids slightly increased the rate of improvement in oxygenation and spirometry and decreased the treatment failure rate.29 Of those 14 patients treated with placebo, eight had no improvement in symptoms or required admission to hospital. For patients treated with prednisolone, none of 13 had treatment failure. A different study of 30 patients suggested that corticosteroids significantly decreased the rate of relapse from 33\u00b73% to 8\u00b79% in the first 48 h after discharge from the emergency department.30 Finally, data from the Systemic Corticosteroids in COPD Exacerbations clinical trial support the use of corticosteroids in patients admitted to hospital for acute exacerbations of COPD.31 In that trial, patients treated with systemic corticosteroids had fewer treatment failures, better spirometry, and shorter hospital stays. Based on all such evidence, patients admitted to hospital for COPD exacerbations commonly receive systemic corticosteroids. The rationale is that although the favourable effect of corticosteroids is modest, even a small improvement is beneficial in patients with severe airway obstruction who cannot tolerate further respiratory deterioration. Additional studies are needed to find the optimum dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy during acute exacerbations. Importantly, the resolution of an acute exacerbation after corticosteroids for 7\u201314 days should not be taken as an indication for chronic systemic-corticosteroid therapy.",

As a single agent, the effects of ipratropium on spirometry are at least equal to the slight effects of \u03b2-adrenergic agonists, possibly with less risk of decreased blood oxygenation. Patients with exacerbations of COPD on inhaled ipratropium had a small but significant increase (0\u00b78 kPa) in arterial PO2 within 30 min. By contrast, with inhaled metaproterenol there was a transient decrease (0\u00b78 kPa) in arterial PO2.32 This decrease in arterial PO2 after \u03b2-adrenergic agonists has been attributed to transient worsening of ventilation-perfusion matching because of vasodilation of the pulmonary vasculature, or increases in cardiac output, or both. Since the rate of onset for bronchodilation is slow with ipratropium (peak effect 60\u201390 min), many physicians prefer \u03b2-adrenergic agonists as the first-line bronchodilator during acute exacerbations. In practice, \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and ipratropium are frequently combined to treat exacerbations, especially when patients respond poorly to therapy. Extrapolation from studies of patients with stable COPD support combination therapy, but at least one study of acute exacerbations did not show any benefit from the combination of these agents.32\n",

Evidence indicates that non-invasive positive-pressure assisted ventilation is useful for severely ill patients who do not require immediate endotracheal intubation.43, 44, 45 Mechanical ventilation, with its potential complications of barotrauma and infection, can then be avoided. The best time to start non-invasive mechanical ventilation is not established, but early intervention if the respiratory rate is more than 30 breaths per min and the pH is less than 7\u00b735 has been suggested.46 Successful non-invasive positive-pressure assisted ventilation should improve respiratory rate and pH within 1 h. Positive pressure via a tight-fitting facial or nasal mask lessens the work of breathing, which may allow recovery of fatigued respiratory muscles. Interestingly, even brief periods (6\u20138 h/day) of non-invasive support seem to decrease the risk of an eventual need for intubation.44 This technique is recommended only for tolerant and cooperative patients who are not sedated, are haemodynamically stable, able to protect their airways and clear secretions, and, importantly, are cared for by intensive-care support staff familiar with non-invasive support. This technique will probably become an increasingly popular short-term intervention for select patients.",

Notably, the absolute value of arterial PCO2 alone should not be used to indicate the need for intubation since many patients with severe COPD may have a baseline compensated respiratory acidosis and do not require assisted ventilation. Arterial PCO2 must be assessed in relation to arterial pH. When patients do require intubation and mechanical ventilation for exacerbations, they should be supported with positive-pressure ventilation with assist-control, intermittent-mandatory, or pressure-support, ventilatory methods. Pressure-support ventilation may be more comfortable for patients but outcomes have not been shown to be different from the two other methods. The major complications of invasive positive-pressure ventilation are barotrauma, pneumonia, and local complications of endotracheal tubes. Risk of barotrauma is decreased by keeping the autopositive end-expiratory pressure to a minimum.2, 3\nPanelGeneral guidelines for endotraheal intubation during acute exacerbations of COPDPersistent hypoxaemia with failure to reach arterial PO2\n55\u201360 mm Hg or O2 saturation <88\u201390% despite maximum therapy, including supplemental oxygenWorsening acute respiratory acidosis despite maximum therapy Signs of progressing respiratory-muscle fatigue despite maximum therapyDeterioration of mental statusInability to protect airwayInability to clear copious secretions",

            "text": "We practise the following general-management plan. For inpatient treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, assessment begins with clinical assessment and measurement of arterial blood gases for evidence of respiratory failure that needs assisted ventilation. We identify comorbid illnesses, such as pneumonia, and medications that could contribute to respiratory deterioration. Various treatments are started. Controlled low-flow, supplemental oxygen is delivered to achieve and maintain an arterial PO2 of at least 7\u00b73\u20138\u00b70 kPa. Delivery of oxygen by nasal prongs is generally preferred to mask delivery because prongs are more comfortable and patients are more likely to leave them in place. Arterial blood gases are measured serially when patients are on supplemental oxygen to ensure that they are not among the minority who develop respiratory acidosis upon delivery of oxygen. We administer a broad-spectrum antibiotic. For patients admitted to hospital with severe airflow obstruction at high risk of treatment failure, we generally select a second-generation cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, or second-generation macrolide. Bronchospasm is treated and mucociliary clearance possibly improved with inhaled \u03b2-adrenergic agonists, given by metered-dose inhaler and spacer under direct supervision. For patients with severe or rapidly progressive deterioration and only a slight response to \u03b2-adrenergic agonists, ipratropium by inhalation every 4\u20136 h is added. Patients are started on intravenous methylprednisolone and changed to prednisolone after 1\u20133 days when clear improvement is seen. To help mobilise secretions, patients are encouraged to cough while sitting upright in a chair, and early ambulation is encouraged. Chest physiotherapy is not done routinely since evidence is insufficient to show any value in acute exacerbations. Throughout treatment, patients undergo frequent clinical assessments, and arterial blood gases and oximetry are monitored to assess response to therapy. For patients who have severe and worsening symptoms of respiratory acidosis despite therapy, or who have hypoxaemia on supplemental oxygen, assisted ventilation is used (panel). For select patients, non-invasive ventilation is preferred.",
