This study was conducted with the aim of exploring oncology nurses' perception of the consequences of clinical empathy in patients and nurses and the factors influencing it. Methods A qualitative study was conducted by semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The participants were 6 male and 9 female oncology nurses who were selected by purposive sampling. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results The theme of \"empathy as a double-sided mirror\" was created, based on oncology nurses' perception of the effects of clinical empathy in patients and nurses. Two themes of \"organizational factors\" and \"contextual factors\" were generated in response to influencing factors on clinical empathy. Conclusions By awareness of the effects of clinical empathy, controlling the barriers and strengthening the facilitators, there is a possibility to design interventional programs to develop empathy as a clinical competency in oncology nurses.",

Empathy is a complex, multidimensional, and dynamic concept, so in scientific literature the conceptualization of empathy has been stated by different words: emotional, moral, cognitive, behavioral, and clinical empathy [3] . Clinical empathy is defined as compassionate professionalism and the ability to understand the patient's situation, perspective, feelings, and actions in a helping or therapeutic way [4] . Clinical empathy has emotional, metacognitive, contextual, and interpersonal dimensions and its measurement is not easy [3] .",

            "text": "In oncology wards, development of the nurse-patient empathic communication is very important for patients because it relieves mental stress [5] , reduces anxiety, gives pain control, and increases emotional compatibility and hope [6] . Clinical empathy has many benefits such as increased patient satisfaction, better adherence to treatments, help to more accurate diagnosis, reduction of distress and illness symptoms as well as the improvement of quality of life in patients [7, 8] . The results of studies indicate that empathy maximizes patient care management, reduces the financial needs of the health care system, shortens the treatment period, and reduces the need for resources [9, 10] . The results of a qualitative study in Pakistan showed that cancer patients need an empathic nurse. Empathic nurses sense the vulnerability of the patients and respond accordingly; however, some patients are dissatisfied with their communication with nurses and suffer from anxiety [11] . Although there is a positive relationship between empathy, patient outcomes, and the clinical competency of healthcare personnel, there is still ambiguity about the influence of empathy on nurses [12] . In general, empathy as a laborious emotional effort requires energy, resources, and an appropriate environment for achieving the best results. Emotional distress, high workload, being responsible for very ill and dying patients, and having no time for self-care can lead to compassion fatigue. These multiple stresses in healthcare personnel may lead to insomnia, marital conflicts, substance abuse, and job attrition [13] . On the other hand, factors such as being very self-critical, having conflicting feelings regarding work, and being young and inexperienced can increase compassion fatigue and burnout in nurses, following empathy with patients.",

One study showed inconsistent evidence, with positive and negative correlations between different subscales of empathy and burnout [15] . Other research results showed that high and low levels of \"cognitive empathy\" are associated with high degrees of depression in individuals, but moderate empathy creates the highest protection against depression [16] . These controversial results can be due to quantitative research results, since they cannot adequately reveal the concept of empathy and its relationships with other phenomenon [17] .",

This method includes the following steps: transcribing of the entire interview immediately after each interview, reading the entire text to achieve a general understanding of its content, identifying the meaning units and extracting primary codes, classifying similar codes in comprehensive subcategories and categories (manifest content), and then determining the themes (the latent content). In this way, first meaning units were identified in sentences or paragraphs in the context of the interviews, and then they were condensed. The condensed meaning units were abstracted and labeled as primary codes. In primary coding, the text of each interview was read several times, and its original sentences were extracted and recorded. Next, the related codes were extracted and placed in a subcategory based on similarity. Afterwards, similar subcategories were placed in one main category, and ultimately themes were determined [21] .",

Problems and issues related to communication within the healthcare team and the healthcare organization can affect the nurses' empathy.

They stated feelings of tranquility and psychological satisfaction in the subcategory of benefit of empathy for the nurse. Dal Santo and his colleagues tried to answer the main question in their research \"does the emotional interaction with the patient have positive consequences for nurses?\" Their research showed that empathy consists of two components: the cognitive (perspective taking) and the emotional (compassion). However, the cognitive component increases job satisfaction, work engagement and reduces job quitting, the emotional component does not [22] . The compassionate and empathic performance of nurses with patients is linked to positive and negative effects. Experience of positive emotions by nurses is described with satisfaction of compassion. Whereas, negative emotions may bring burnout and compassion fatigue [23] . These findings show the different effects of the patients' perspective taking and compassion on nurses' well-being [22] . Other research findings in the Malopolska Province of Poland, with 256 physicians and 410 nurses with different specialties, showed that with increasing empathy, the professional burnout of the healthcare team members decreased [24] . A qualitative study showed that nurses' empathy with patients has been studied more in oncology wards and intensive care units (ICUs), than in the other wards of the hospital. Empathy with patients in these areas can be a reason to enhance the motivation of nurses to continue their work in these wards [25] . Hojat concluded that empathic interactions lead to an understanding of experience, concern, and other people's perspective [2] . Another study suggests that empathy leads to more useful and accurate patient information, a better interpretation of patient complaints, a more specific diagnosis, better management of patient's problems, and more successful treatment [8] .",

Many cancer patients suffer from a variety of negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and psychological discomfort [28, 29] .

Exhaustion, fatigue, discomfort and nervousness, imagination of the disease in themselves and the family, anxiety, and burnout were stated by the participants. Earlier studies indicate evidence of high levels of stress among nurses in oncology settings [31] . Nurses who are working in oncology wards experience high levels of stress, compassionate fatigue, and burnout. Research findings in Australia indicated that more than 70% of oncology nurses experienced moderate to severe stress. Burnout was a result of nurses' physical and mental fatigue and particularly observed in wards where the emotional involvement of nurses with patients was higher [32] . Contrary to these results, in a study conducted in Spain, a significant relationship was found between high level of empathy and low level of burnout between nurses [33] . However, the results of a systematic review showed that the relationship between empathy and burnout is very complicated. It seems that the ability to self-regulate emotions during empathic communications reduces the risk of burnout [23] .",

In a qualitative study, factors including job strain, task-centeredness, no formal training, poor manager support, and nurse-patient gender imbalance were mentioned by oncology nurses as barriers to empathy [34] . The results of a quantitative research showed that organizational factors such as staffing and resource adequacy, management ability, leadership, and support of nurses have a negative relationship with compassionate fatigue, after controlling for the demographic characteristics of nurses (gender, social status, ward type, work shift, type of employment, illness, years of experience in the current situation) [35] . Therefore, the importance of continuing professional support in organizations is undeniable [36] . Supervisors in healthcare organizations play an important role in controlling the emotional load of nurses, the needs related to their job. They can give them support to do their job better [37] .",

The result of a study by Taheri et al. showed that cultural variables are important factors in the quality and quantity of empathy with the patient [46] . Nevertheless, oncology nurses in our study referred to the specific characteristics of the oncology wards and claimed that the specific atmosphere of the oncology wards, including the long-term hospitalization of cancer patients, would make nurses more empathic.

The doctor visits their patients only a short time during round of the ward, however the nurses stay a long time with the patients and meet their needs. But, when something bad happens, the nurses are blamed for that. For example, in our context, when everything is good, the people say, what a good hospital, in this case they say that the doctors are expert in this hospital. But, when something goes wrong, typically, when a patient dies, the people say the nurses were unskilled in this hospital. In general, if the people in our society always blame the nurses, it is so bad and disappointing for the nurses\u2026.. it is discouraging them to do empathy with their patients.\"[Nurse,12] think instructions and rules about accreditation are constantly changing in the Ministry of Health that you have to coordinate with them, also these changes have an effect on nurses' empathy, because it takes a lot of time to get to know them.\"[Nurse,8]",
