            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious viral disease of the upper-respiratory tract in chickens (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008). It is prevalent in all countries with an intensive poultry industry, affecting the performance of both meat-type and egg-laying birds, thereby causing considerable economic loss within the poultry industry. Although a respiratory disease is the most frequently observed syndrome (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008, McMartin, 1993) this same virus has also been implicated in nephritis, as reported from many countries (Ignjatovic et al., 2002, Meir et al., 2004, Winterfield and Albassam, 1984, Ziegler et al., 2002). The etiologic agent is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, group 3, which includes only avian coronaviruses. It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997), containing three major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), surrounding the viral RNA; the membrane glycoprotein (M); and the spike glycoprotein (S), located on the surface of the viral envelope. The S protein contains two post-translational sub-units, S1, and S2.",

Detection of IBV infection in poultry flocks, as well as differentiation from other upper-respiratory diseases, is a major challenge and necessitates the use of appropriate diagnostic methods.",

            "text": "Virus isolation in specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs, the reference standard, is time-consuming and may require more than one passage before obtaining a result (Gelb and Jackwood, 1998). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are rapid, specific, and accurate, and when targeting the viral S1 gene, the amplification products can be used for further classification of the virus (Cavanagh et al., 1990, Gelb et al., 2005, Jackwood et al., 1997, Lee et al., 2000). Nevertheless, compared to virus isolation, these assays may lack sensitivity when used directly from clinical specimens. To overcome this drawback, viral RNA extraction is preceded by propagation of the virus in embryonated eggs for 36\u201348 h (Kwon et al., 1993, Meir et al., 2004). Real-time RT-PCR assays that make use of a labeled TaqMan\u00ae probe are designed to amplify a small fragment of up to 200 bp. These features render the assay very specific and sensitive, as was demonstrated with viruses such as SARS coronavirus (Emery et al., 2004) and type A influenza virus (Cattoli et al., 2004). A real-time RT-PCR assay amplifying a fragment of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the IBV genome was highly sensitive but not specific, detecting turkey coronaviruses (TCoV) as well as IBV (Callison et al., 2006). The frequent occurrence of TCoV in the poultry industry, as well as its relatedness to IBV (Breslin et al., 1999), necessitates an assay that can differentiate between these two viruses. In this study a real-time TaqMan\u00ae RT-PCR targeting the N gene for IBV detection was developed. The N gene was chosen since it is highly conserved among IBV strains and is abundant in infected cells. The assay was tested with tracheal or cloacal swabs directly from chickens infected experimentally and clinical submissions, without amplification in embryonated eggs, and validated with known positive and negative samples. The sensitivity was compared to virus isolation and RT-PCR targeting the N and S1 genes.",

To distinguish between true and false negative reactions resulting from the presence of PCR-inhibitors, 2.4 \u03bcl of an exogenous internal positive control (IPC) mix, containing IPC DNA, specific primers, and a VIC\u2122 probe (Applied Biosystems) was added. The reaction was carried out in StepOne\u2122 Plus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) at 45 \u00b0C for 10 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 60 \u00b0C for 45 s. Amplification plots were recorded, analyzed, and the threshold cycle (Ct) determined with the StepOne software, version 2 (Applied Biosystems).",
