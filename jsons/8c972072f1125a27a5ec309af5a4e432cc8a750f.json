Larger series have demonstrated that advanced age and medical comorbidities are powerful predictors of death from COVID-19 4, 5 . These factors are also associated with cancer incidence, which may explain the link between cancer history and poor outcomes with COVID infection. Alternatively, cancer or cancer treatments may directly impair patients' ability to overcome COVID infection.",

Patients with prior lung irradiation could be alerted to be particularly attentive to measures that can reduce COVID-19 exposure risk. Vaccines or other preventative interventions to minimize infection risk or disease severity could preferentially be offered to individuals with prior lung irradiation.",
