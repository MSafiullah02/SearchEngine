Bats are found on every continent except Antarctica, and more than 1100 surviving bat species exist world-wide (Simmons, 2005b).

To implement the Bern Convention in Europe, the European Community adopted Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (commonly known as the EC Habitats and Species Directive) in 1992 (Mitchell-Jones and McLeish, 2004). After increasing awareness of the fragile conservation status of bats in Europe, the Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats (UNEP/EUROBATS) came into force in 1994, under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn Convention/UNEP/CMS). Currently, 30 of the 48 Range States in Europe are parties to the EUROBATS Agreement (EUROBATS, 2004b).",

All bats and their roosts are protected in the UK under the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (WCA) 1981, which provides the legal framework for bat-related legislation and implementation in the UK for both the Bern Convention (1982) and the Bonn Convention (1985). In England and Wales the provisions of the WCA have recently been strengthened through the Countryside and Rights of Way (CROW) Act, 2000. In addition, the UK ratified EUROBATS in September 1992. Certain bat species are also listed on Annex II (and all species on Annex IV) of the European Habitats Directive. As of July 2004, the UK had recommended 42 maternity and hibernacula areas as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), and 93 areas as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs) under the Habitats Directive. Bat species were either the main reason for an area\u2019s recommendation, or a qualifying feature. Implementation of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) also includes action for six bat species and the habitats that support them, in the form of Species Action Plans (SAPs) (JNCC, 1998\u20132005).",

There are currently seven virus genotypes (Table 3\n) in the Lyssavirus genus (family Rhabdoviridae). The genotypes that have been recorded in bats include classical rabies virus (RABV), Lagos bat virus (LBV), Duvenhage virus (DUVV), the European bat viruses (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) and the Australian bat virus (ABLV). In addition, four viruses that have been isolated from bats are currently awaiting classification in the Lyssavirus genus. These are Aravan virus (ARAV) (Arai et al., 2003, Botvinkin et al., 2003, Kuzmin et al., 2003), Khujand virus (KHUV), West Caucasian Bat virus (WCBV), and Irkut virus (IRKV) (Botvinkin et al., 2003, Kuzmin et al., 2005). Only one Lyssavirus genotype, Mokola virus (MOKV), has never been isolated from bats. Rabies can be caused by any of the genotypes within the Lyssavirus genus. It is a fatal disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that can affect all mammals, and is an important human zoonosis (c. 55,000 cases worldwide p.a.; World Health Organisation, WHO, 2006), with infection resulting in a wide variety of neurological symptoms. In bats, clinical signs of rabies include weight loss, lack of coordination, muscular spasms, agitation, increased vocalisation and overt aggression (Barrett et al., 2005, Bruijn, 2003, Johnson et al., 2003, Shanker et al., 2004, Whitby et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Rabies may be suspected when bats exhibit unusual behavioural signs or unexplained paralysis, but clinical indications of rabies in bats can be variable and are not always characteristic. Bats may also be chronic asymptomatic carriers (excreting virus but clinically silent), or may secrete virus prior to displaying acute clinical signs and succumbing to disease. (non-clinical, with active infection) (Aguilar-Setien et al., 2005). Many viruses can give rise to encephalitis, causing unusual neurological signs. However, other, non-viral diseases and disorders can cause behavioural and/or physical signs in bats similar to those indicative of lyssavirus infection. For example, most recorded injuries to British bats are caused by cats (O\u2019Brien et al., 2005), collision with a vehicle, or roost damage (VLA, unpublished data). Physical trauma to the skull may cause neurological signs such as spasmodic shivering, flaccid or complete paralysis (Lane, 1999). Lead poisoning has been documented in fruit bats in Australia (Sutton and Wilson, 1983). Signs presented included severe muscle fasciculation, inability to fly, excessive salivation, ataxia, and making distress noises when approached or handled. Indeed, lead poisoning has been reported in conjunction with ABLV in frugivorous bats and the ABLV initially went undiagnosed because the poisoning was thought to cause the signs presented (Skerratt et al., 1998). However, lead poisoning was also mistaken for rabies in a dog in Australia (Animal Health Australia, 2000). Poisoning by blue-green algae has been reported in bats (WHO, 1998), usually resulting in hepatotoxity. The toxins involved include anatoxin-a, a hepatotoxin which leads to convulsions, staggering, abnormal posturing and arching of the back (Codd et al., 2003). As with viruses, many bacteria can give rise to encephalitis, and therefore altered neurological signs. Little is known about the normal bacterial flora of bats, but pathogenic bacteria have occasionally been isolated. Listerial encephalitis has been mistaken for rabies in cattle in Australia (Animal Health Australia, 2000), whilst Listeria induced \u2018circling disease\u2019 is common in sheep, and has been seen concurrently with EBLV in Denmark (Ronsholt, 2002, Tj\u00f8rneh\u00f8j et al., 2006). Fatal meningoencephalitis associated with Listeria monocytogenes has also been seen in fruit bats (Hohne et al., 1975). Brucella species can also cause meningoencephalitis and CNS disease in humans and animals (Sohn et al., 2003), and anti-Brucella agglutins have been found in vampire bats (Ricciardi et al., 1976). Neurological disease has been documented in Australian species of Old World fruit bats caused by the helminth Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Signs included anorexia, hind limb weakness/paralysis, and tetraplegia. Post-mortem examination revealed severe meningoencephalitis (Reddacliff et al., 1999). Post-mortem diagnosis (including laboratory tests) must therefore be undertaken to exclude notifiable and exotic diseases such as rabies.",

The reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to detect the presence of pan-lyssa virus RNA. Nested primers for pan-lyssa virus or primers specific for EBLVs can be effectively used for the detection of low levels of viral RNA, especially from non-invasive samples including saliva (Heaton et al., 1997, Johnson et al., 2002). Virus isolation is performed using a homogenised suspension of suspect tissue (normally brain tissue) or from saliva (Noah et al., 1998) by either the rabies tissue culture inoculation test (RTCIT) or the mouse inoculation test (MIT) (Koprowski, 1996, Webster and Casey, 1996).",

EBLV-1a is thought to be the most recently introduced from North Africa via southern Spain, and exhibits an east-west European division. The distribution of EBLV-1b appears to follow a north-south division. The Netherlands and France are the only countries in which both EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b have been found (Amengual et al., 1997, Picard-Meyer et al., 2004a, Picard-Meyer et al., 2004b, Van der Poel et al., 2005). The majority (>95%) of the \u223c750 EBLV-1 cases in European bats have been identified in one bat species, Eptesicus serotinus (Table 5\n), which should therefore be regarded as the most likely reservoir species. E. serotinus is found both in the UK and mainland Europe (Stebbings and Robinson, 1992). In the UK, it is found mainly south of a line from The Wash (East Anglia) to south Wales (Hutson, 1991). It is widespread across western Europe, north to Denmark and southern Sweden, south to North Africa, eastwards to the Himalayas and north to Korea, possibly expanding its range in Europe (Baag\u00f8e and Jensen, 1973, Baag\u00f8e, 2001). This species is not commonly migratory, but movements of up to 330 km (200 miles), have been recorded from eastern Europe (Stebbings and Griffith, 1986, Baag\u00f8e, 2001, Strelkov, 1969). Active infection (replicating virus in the CNS and/or excretion of virus in saliva) caused by EBLV-1 has not been recorded in the UK to date, and the disparity between EBLV-1 records in Europe and the UK may be related to the limited geographical distribution and population size of E. serotinus within the UK.",

            "text": "EBLV-2 was first isolated in 1985 from a human, (a Swiss bat biologist) who had been working with bats in Finland, Switzerland and Malaysia (Lumio et al., 1986). In 1986, EBLV-2 was isolated in Denmark and Germany from Myotis daubentonii and in Denmark from M. dasycneme (Table 5), the only known natural wild hosts of this virus (apart from a single case in Nyctalus noctula). In total, there are only 18 records of this virus (16 in bats, two in humans) from Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, the Ukraine, Switzerland and the UK. Both Myotis bat species (of the eleven Myotis species in Europe, EUROBATS, 2004a) are strongly associated with open riparian habitats, trawling small flying insects from lakes, rivers and ponds. M. dasycneme is confined to central and eastern Europe, from north-eastern France, the Netherlands and Belgium in the east, southern Sweden in the north and Slovakia to the south (Stebbings and Griffith, 1986, Roer, 2001, Limpens et al., 2000, Roer and Schober, 2001). In the UK, four cases of EBLV-2 have been identified in M. daubentonii (Table 5). Two of the four bats were reported as having bitten humans, and one was reported as being brought into a domestic residence by a cat. Of the four UK cases, two originated in the county of Lancashire (2002, 2004), one in Sussex (1996), and one in Surrey (2004). Both counties of Lancashire and Sussex have submitted a substantially higher proportion of M. daubentonii than other counties for passive surveillance testing. This perhaps indicates that high numbers of bats (of a given species) submitted for rabies testing from specific geographical regions increases the probability of identifying positive cases. Positive results, establishing the presence of EBLV-2 in all four bats\u2019 brains, were obtained by FAT, RTCIT and MIT. Identification of the genotype in each case was undertaken by PCR and sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene and shown to be EBLV-2.",

            "text": "Concern that the disease could be introduced into the UK by bats crossing from mainland Europe led to a programme of screening dead bats for the presence of lyssaviruses. This was initiated at the Rabies Research and Diagnostic Unit at the Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA: formerly Central Veterinary Laboratory). The passive surveillance programme has been in place since 1987. Dead bats are sent to the VLA by members of the public, or more frequently, by members of the UK\u2019s local bat groups. The annual total of submissions, and the number of submissions for each species between 1987 and 2004, including sex and age ratios are given in Table 7\n. The average number of bats sent to the VLA each year since 1987 is 270 (range 96\u2013898). However, passive surveillance is likely to have several inherent biases. First, the habitat and colony preference of individual species is thought to have an effect on how frequently they are found by the general public. For example, Pipistrellus species (P. pipistrellus/Pipistrellus pygmaeus) and E. serotinus utilize houses for maternity colonies, increasing the likelihood of grounded adults or young being found. M. daubentonii frequently uses tree cavities during the summer, and caves and mines in the winter, and is therefore far less likely to come into contact with members of the public. This means that some species, when compared to the most recent UK species population estimates, are being under- or over-represented by passive surveillance (Table 8\n). Second, successful passive surveillance is dependent on bats being recovered from a geographical range that mirrors their natural distribution. In the UK, there are over 90 volunteer bat groups creating a UK wide network, but the activity of these groups and their geographic locations are not necessarily uniform across the UK. Eighty three percent of bats (1987\u20132004) have been sent in from England (n\n = 4041), 8.7% from Scotland (n\n = 426), 3.5% from Wales (n\n = 172), with the remaining bats sent from Northern Ireland (n\n = 15), Republic of Ireland (n\n = 1), Channel Islands (n\n = 32), UK offshore (n\n = 1), and those of unknown origin (n\n = 185). This has created regions of the UK where very few bats, of few species, have been tested (VLA, unpublished data). Since the detection of EBLV-2 in a M. daubentonii bat in Sussex (1996), the Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) has been working in collaboration with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the VLA to promote both the importance of testing bats for EBLVs, and the essential role of the local bat groups. The annual total for bat submission under the passive surveillance scheme have reflected the pattern of UK EBLV cases, with a substantial increase in submissions in the period following each positive case (Harris et al., 2006).",

Therefore, a UK-wide active surveillance programme began in 2003, bringing together experts from the divergent fields of bat ecology and virology (Defra, VLA, University of Bristol [UoB], Central Science Laboratory [CSL], Scottish National Heritage [SNH], University of Aberdeen [UoA], and the BCT).",

The serum data collected 2003\u20132004, combined with the oropharyngeal swab results may imply that the bats had elicited a sufficient immune response to suppress the virus and might therefore remain sero-positive without excreting virus in saliva. It is probable that bats excreting virus are more likely to show atypical behavioural changes when caught in the field (Johnson et al., 2003). Therefore, not finding EBLV-2 viral RNA in saliva samples from bats that were antibody positive was not unexpected (Brass, 1994). Additionally, the excretion of RABV at least is known to vary with time, an infected animal can excrete virus one day and not the next \u2013 so the bat would have to be excreting virus at the time of swabbing for us to be able to detect it. All of the bats that were sampled appeared to be healthy, and were not exhibiting obvious clinical signs of rabies. The majority of the M. daubentonii sampled were caught on the wing, another indication of relative good health, considering that active infection in bats may lead to paralysis. The E. serotinus sampled were caught both on the wing, and in some cases, taken by hand from their day-roost locations. Therefore, ability to fly was not always observed before sampling of E. serotinus occurred.",

The first recording of RABV in North America in an insectivorous bat was in 1951 (King et al., 2004), and since then it has been documented from all over North America (Cliquet and Picard-Meyer, 2004). The annual average prevalence of RABV (viral RNA detection) in bats tested (dead or moribund bats) from nine states of North America between 1988 and 1992 was 7.4% (n\n = 192/2583). The bat species most commonly submitted are Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis lucifugus, Lasiurus borealis, Lasiurus blossevilli, and Tadarida brasiliensis. The prevalence of RABV infection in submitted bats was lowest in M. lucifugus (1.2%), and highest in L. cinereus and T. brasiliensis, both at 24% (Smith et al., 1995). Surveillance studies indicate a prevalence of rabies virus in <1% of randomly sampled bats (viral RNA detection), and between 3% and 25% among bats submitted to state health departments (Brass, 1994, Schneider et al., 1957, Constantine, 1967a, Trimarchi and Debbie, 1977, Childs et al., 1994, Yancey et al., 1997, Trimarchi, 1998).",

Cases of human RABV infection resulting from vampire bat species may be under-reported in Latin America, but several outbreaks have been recorded (Uieda et al., 1998, Milagres, 2005, Rodriguez, 2005). Attacks by vampire bats appear to occur most frequently in areas of human settlement (Caraballo, 1996, Schneider, 1991, Schneider et al., 1996, Schneider and Uieda, 1998), or when normal food sources are not available, such as following the removal of pigs during a hog cholera eradication campaign (McCarthy, 1989). RABV of vampire bat origin in cattle is of economic concern, but has also led to significant losses of both habitat and bat species through ill-conceived bat control programmes.",

During this time, ABLV was also isolated from two further fruit bat species (P. scapulatus and P. poliocephalus), and from an insectivorous species (Saccolaimus flaviventris). In 2000, contact between a wild P. alecto and a captive P. poliocephalus separated by wire-mesh resulted in transmission of ABLV. Subsequent modification of the enclosure prevented future direct contact between free-living wild bats and the captive colony (Warrilow et al., 2003). Evidence of infection has been recorded in bats in all states except South Australia (Fraser et al., 1996, Tidemann et al., 1997, Hooper et al., 1997, Gould et al., 1998, Samaratunga et al., 1998). A survey involving 119 bats linked with potential human contact cases, including various Pteropus species (n\n = 85) and nine insectivorous species (n\n = 34), found eight positives (by FAT) in Pteropus species, (prevalence estimate of 9.4% in submitted bats) and no positives in the other species. Opportunity for cross-species transmission of ABLV involving pteropodids may be partly facillitated by the large, seasonal, nomadic and sometimes multi-species colonies in which they are known to congregate (Warrilow et al., 2003).",

            "text": "There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that bats tolerate lyssavirus infection. A study following the unexplained infection of a captive colony of Rousettus aegyptiacus with EBLV-1 (Ronsholt et al., 1998), demonstrated that though the virus was pathogenic for the bat, this species could survive challenge with this virus (rabies antigen and neurological signs were detected in six out of seven of the 16 inoculated bats) (Van der Poel et al., 2000). Further studies revealed that up to 85% of apparently healthy colony members (n\n = 43) were seropositive for EBLV-1, indicating exposure to the virus (Wellenberg et al., 2002). In a recent study, the EBLV-1 RNA was detected in a range of tissues from apparently healthy specimens of M. myotis, Myotis nattereri, R. ferrumequinum, and Myotis schreibersii. In the same study, neutralising antibodies were present in M. myotis, M. schreibersii, Tadarida teniotis and R. ferrumequinum (Serra-Cobo et al., 2002). These studies corroborate investigations of bats endemic to Europe, which demonstrated, by repeated humane blood sampling of selected bat colonies, that the same seropositive individuals could be detected over a six-year period. This illustrates that bats may survive EBLV infection with possible long-term maintenance of virus in infected healthy individuals (Perez-Jorda et al., 1995, Echevarria et al., 2001, Serra-Cobo et al., 2002, O\u2019Shea et al., 2003, O\u2019Shea et al., 2004).",

            "text": "However, it is not clear how EBLVs are transmitted between bats within a colony. The complex social behaviour of bats, sometimes including allogrooming (Kerth and Konig, 1999) may possibly enable virus dissemination through the sharing of saliva. It is speculated, however, that the mechanisms of EBLV transmission via the oral route and the level of viral load involved may result in a \u2018silent\u2019 (no obvious clinical signs) infection. The possibility exists that bats might act as \u2018asymptomatic viral carriers\u2019 resulting in a sub-clinical infection. Virus re-activation may also occur as a result of specific \u2018stress\u2019 factors including pregnancy, hibernation, nutritional deficit, and migration, that cause immunosuppression and potentially increase rabies-related mortality (Sulkin et al., 1959, Sulkin et al., 1960, Sims et al., 1963, Constantine, 1967a, Constantine, 1967b). Previous work (Soave, 1962, Soave, 1964) has shown that even after long periods of asymptomatic infections, guinea pigs developed clinical rabies when subjected to stress (Messenger et al., 2003a). In contrast, as part of complex bat behaviour, biting incidents that may result in viral transmission are fairly common. Transmission could be followed by abortive peripheral infection via lack of virus replication or the development of sterilising immunity. Alternatively, the virus replicates locally, is transmitted to the CNS and fatal infection ensues. In 2001, a captive colony of 35 E. fuscus was created from wild-caught bats and held for just under five months to study the epidemiology and transmission of the classical rabies virus (RABV). Within the first month of capture, two bats died, and were found to be positive for RABV by RT-PCR of brain tissue, salivary gland and oral swabs. Of the remaining bats, all remained outwardly healthy, with two bats seroconverting whilst in captivity. Five other individuals that had been seropositive for RABV before capture, maintained their positive antibody levels (Shanker et al., 2004).",

In some cases however, infection may result from the virus coming into contact with mucous membranes (e.g. eyes, nose and mouth). There are four reported instances of human rabies following inhalation of aerosol virus, two cases in a laboratory (Winkler et al., 1973), and two in a bat cave (Gibbons, 2002). However, it cannot be shown conclusively, particularly with the cave infections, that there were no other means of infection, as one of the cavers involved was reported as having an open wound on his face (Constantine, 1962, Constantine, 1988a, Constantine, 1988b, Brass, 1994, Gibbons, 2002). However, airborne transmission of Lyssaviruses has been demonstrated experimentally (Johnson et al., 2006a). There are also a small number of cases of fatal human rabies infection in recipients of donated organs (Hough et al., 1979, Srinivasan et al., 2005, Hellenbrand et al., 2005).",

These organs appear to be the most significant in relation to the most common forms of virus spread; bite, lick (on broken skin) or contact with mucous membranes. All three confirmed human cases of EBLV documented previous exposure to bat bites. The human case of rabies caused by EBLV-1 reported a specific biting incident from a single bat. The two human cases of rabies caused by EBLV-2 reported multiple exposures to bats involving biting incidents. It is possible that EBLV transmission may occur infrequently due to low levels of virus in saliva, poor invasive ability of EBLVs, or immune status of those bitten (Fooks et al., 2003a). This suggests that bat to human spread of EBLVs may require a significantly higher viral load before an active infection is established compared to the virus load received from a dog bite. However, the extent and depth of exposure (physical area of exposure and amount of saliva) in dog bites is generally much greater than that of bat bites.",

            "text": "In a comparison of two RABV isolates (a L. noctivagans isolate taken from a naturally infected human from California, and a coyote street virus isolate taken from a naturally infected coyote from Texas) from North America, the isolate from L. noctivagans replicated to higher titre levels in epithelial and fibroblast cells at cooler temperatures (34 \u00b0C) (Dietzschold et al., 2000, Morimoto et al., 1996), potentially facilitating more effective local replication in the dermis, even after a seemingly superficial bite by this bat species. This type of situation, where a species has evolved genetic changes associated with enhanced viral infectivity, has been described as the increased infectivity hypothesis (Messenger et al., 2003a), although currently this theory remains largely unproven (Hughes et al., 2005). Between EBLVs, a difference in pathogenicity is believed to occur, with EBLV-1 being potentially more virulent than EBLV-2, with all reported spillover infections in terrestrial (non-human) mammals being of EBLV-1 origin. Recent studies have indicated that foxes (Vos et al., 2004a), cats, mice and ferrets are more susceptible to EBLV-1 infection than EBLV-2, (Vos et al., 2004b), as is also the case in murine models (Brookes et al., 2005a, Brookes et al., 2005b). No spillover hosts have been reported for ABLV; recorded human infections have been caused by direct exposure to infected bats (Mackenzie et al., 2003). ABLV infection has not been identified in either domestic or wild (non-bat) mammal species (McColl et al., 2000, Mackenzie et al., 2003), suggesting that the virus cycles only in bats. ABLV susceptibility studies have initially found that both cats and dogs infected experimentally do seroconvert, and in some cases, exhibit clinical signs (Mackenzie et al., 2003).",

Difficulty in quantifying die-offs may come from a lack of knowledge of baseline population size and mortality rates in wild animals. Adequate knowledge of the behavioural ecology of any rabies vector species, especially those such as bats, as endangered and/or protected species, is integral to the successful management of rabies (Macdonald, 1993).

Vampire bat control programmes have produced ill-conceived and indiscriminate methods for reducing populations (Acha and Arambulo, 1985, Greenhall and Schmidt, 1988), with techniques such as firearms, electrocution, smoke, flame-throwers, dynamite, poison gas, and Newcastle disease as atomised virus used to destroy individuals and roosts (Hutson et al., 2001). These methods may produce short-term reductions in the prevalence of rabies in cattle, but risk the geographical dispersal of disease through forcing bats to move from disrupted roosts into areas where perhaps rabies was not previously a problem (Fooks, 2004d). Bat Conservation International (BCI) has implemented education programmes regarding management of vampire bat populations, in an attempt to promote efficient, species-specific control (Lord, 1988). Experimental RABV vaccination of a captive vampire bat species (D. rotundus) indicated that oral vaccination methods (more suited to potential field vaccination programmes) produce lower rates of sero-conversion than intra-muscular (IM) routes (Aguilar-Setien et al., 1998, Aguilar-Setien et al., 2002).",

The current risk of EBLV spill-over from bats to other organisms in Europe is believed to be low, in comparison with RABV spill-over in both North and Latin America, where outbreaks of bat variant RABV have been reported in striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) in Arizona (Smith et al., 2001) and detected (by monoclonal antibody screening) in other mammal species such as cats, dogs, cattle, horses, sheep and foxes (Messenger et al., 2003a).",

In Venezuela, from 1964 to 1966, an estimated 900,000 bats of various species were gassed annually as part of vampire bat control programmes. Losses of non-target bat species are also thought to have occurred due to the barricading of caves (Pint, 1994), selective burning of trees, and application of anti-coagulent paste (McCarthy, 1978) on randomly caught bats. The potentially detrimental effect of actions such as these upon the local ecosystem, and the effect on bat species diversity have not yet been studied in detail (Hutson et al., 2001). The control of vampire bat populations, in relation to the protection of domestic livestock and humans, may be necessary in certain geographic regions. However, the main aims of any control strategy should be first, to regulate the population levels of the target species (rather than indiscriminate destruction of individuals) and second, to ensure protection of non-target species, to maintain species diversity (Greenhall, 1968, Lord, 1988).",

This, in turn, may result in habitat and/or roost loss, due to reduced tolerance of bats in proximity to human dwellings. Occupational exposure is a potential risk, for groups such as bat researchers, bat care workers/rehabilitators, builders, fishermen, arborists and vets. Education efforts reflecting scientific advice regarding the human health risks associated with bat rabies are essential. Risks to the general public remain minimal, but the fatal consequences of rabies mean that the hazard must be taken seriously. Continuity across countries, regarding handling methods (gloves), vaccination (compulsory or highly recommended) and treatment after potential exposure, are all integral in creating a Europe-wide agreement on management and conservation of bat populations (Racey and Fooks, 2005). Prophylactic vaccination is recommended for those professionally or recreationally exposed to bats in most European countries. Within the UK, there are a number of organisations concerned with bat conservation (e.g. BCT, Mammals Trust UK, Mammal Society, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)), that now have the additional role of advising their members and the general public on bat lyssaviruses issues.",

Bat-associated rabies cases are likely to be under-estimated globally due to lack of reporting or recording of bat related occurrence and/or the lack of rabies isolate typing. The EBLV-2 lyssavirus strain is thought to have been present in the UK for a considerable time (Racey and Fooks, 2005), but the potential spread and infection within bat populations, and the perceived health risk to humans are newer, more immediate issues, requiring surveillance, research and education to enable bat conservation to continue worldwide in a realistic and informed manner. Surveillance programmes for EBLVs throughout Europe and the UK play an integral role in developing a greater understanding of both the transmission and prevalence of the disease. Integrated with this should be research on bat behaviour and movement patterns, to enable the relationship between disease and host to be fully understood.",
