            "text": "Dengue virus is an enveloped, single\u2010stranded positive strand virus, belonging to the Flavivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae, with four related but distinct serotypes (DENV\u20101 to 4) (Halstead, 2007; Simmons et al., 2012). DENV is the aetiologic agent of dengue fever (DF), the most prevalent arthropod\u2010borne viral disease in humans with more than 50\u2013100 million cases worldwide annually. DENV is transmitted by mosquito Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus in the tropical and subtropical regions, where these mosquitoes are endemic, placing 2.5 billion people at risk of infection globally (Guzman et al., 2010; Simmons et al., 2012). Of note, 1% of infected individuals develop more severe, and often lethal, syndromes, designated dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), with children bearing most of the disease burden (Halstead et al., 2007; Guzman et al., 2010). While genotypic differences of DENVs have been indicated to be associated with variations in viral virulence, heterotypic dengue virus antibodies are believed to be a risk factor for the development of DHF or DSS in secondary infections (Guzman et al., 2010). Despite the formidable toll imposed by DENV on world health, no approved vaccine or effective specific anti\u2010DENV therapies are currently available for DENV infection (Halstead, 2005; Guzman et al., 2010).",

            "text": "As a major host defence system against viral infection, the interferon (IFN) family, notably IFN\u2010alpha and IFN\u2010beta, initiates a potent antiviral response that activates the innate immunity mediated by induction of more than 300 IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to the establishment of an anti\u2010viral state (Sadler and Williams, 2008). IFN inducible transmembrane proteins 1, 2 and 3 (IFITM1, 2 and 3) have recently been identified as antiviral mediators induced by IFN, to confer host cells resistance to a variety of pathogenic viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Everitt et al., 2012), West Nile virus (Brass et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010), DENV (Brass et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2012), vesicular stomatitis virus (Weidner et al., 2010), Marburg virus (Huang et al., 2011), Ebola virus (Huang et al., 2011), SARS coronavirus (Huang et al., 2011), human immunodeficiency virus (Lu et al., 2011) and hepatitis C virus (Yao et al., 2012). Mechanistically, IFITMs are the only known ISG products that act to restrict the entry step of viral infection process (Feeley et al., 2011). In particular, Brass et al. demonstrated that the action of a single intrinsic immune effector, IFITM3, profoundly effected as an essential barrier to IAV infection in vitro, in a knockout mouse model and in humans, by blocking the virus\u2010cellular membrane fusion and thus preventing cytosolic entry of the virus (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Everitt et al., 2012). Interestingly, another study revealed that IFITM proteins could interfere with the antibody\u2010dependent enhancement (ADE) effect during secondary dengue virus infection, which bypassed the IFN\u2010mediated restriction (Chan et al., 2012). Taken together, these previous studies have defined IFITM3 as a mediator required for the anti\u2010viral action of IFN, representing a key component of human anti\u2010viral defence system, probably through targeting an early step of viral infection. Open questions, however, remain concerning the detailed biological functions of IFITM in IFN\u2010triggered cascades and the precise mechanisms how the host cellular defence system is involved in IFITM activation in response to viral infections. Such knowledge will provide insights in designing new antiviral therapeutics using IFITM proteins. Furthermore, it is worth noting that secreted or membrane\u2010bound proteins are of particular interest in drug development, because their extracellular nature renders them more accessible for therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "As a novel alternative secretion system, exosomes are small vesicles (30\u2013100 nm in diameter) of endocytic origin that are released from cell into the extracellular environment, under both normal and pathological conditions (Thery et al., 2002). Exosomes are formed through the inward budding of late endosomal membrane that gives rise to intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which involve their fusion with the plasma membrane and release of MVBs into the extracellular environment as exosome (Thery et al., 2002). Prior work has focused on exosome as a new family member of \u2018bioactive vesicles\u2019 that function to promote intercellular communication, by shuttling for proteins, lipids and RNAs of the cells, and participate in various biological processes including immunomodulatory events (Schorey and Bhatnagar, 2008). While shuttling for components of pathogenic microbes, exosome could stimulate immune responses. For instance, exosome isolated from cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have been shown to contain bacterial components and promote antigen presentation and macrophage activation (Bhatnagar and Schorey, 2007a; Bhatnagar et al., 2007b). Moreover, exosome may also promote intercellular spreading of infectious cargo, such as the observed cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission of HIV (Gould et al., 2003; Izquierdo\u2010Useros et al., 2009). On the other hand, despite these advances in our understanding of the functions of exosome, the physiological significance of exosome in shuttling bioactive molecules key to the host defence system remains enigmatic. More recently, Atanu et al. demonstrated that APOBEC3G, which belongs to an ISG family of cellular cytidine deaminases that effect to restrict replication of a variety of exogenous retroviruses, was exported by exosome and conferred antiviral phenotype to recipient cells (Khatua et al., 2009). Li et al. propose an antiviral mechanism of IFN\u2010\u03b1 activity that involves the induction and intercellular transfer of antiviral molecules (such as LAMP\u20102 protein, APOBEC3G proteins, IFI6 mRNA, DDIT3 mRNA, hsa\u2010miR\u2010638, hsa\u2010miR\u20104284 and hsa\u2010miR\u20101260 etc.) from liver non\u2010parenchymal cells to hepatocytes via exosomes, by using HBV infection as a model (Li et al., 2013). They also observed similar exosome\u2010mediated transfer of IFITM1 mRNA from macrophages to HepG2.2.15 cells, but there is not in\u2010depth study on whether the anti\u2010HBV activity is dependent or independent of exosome\u2010mediated transfer of IFITM1 mRNA (Li et al., 2013). It is therefore tempting to hypothesize that direct exchange of ISGs proteins transferred by exosome among host cells might contribute to the establishment of anti\u2010viral state in uninfected cells, in addition to the direct action of IFNs stimulation.",

In cell models of DENV\u20102 infection, we found that endogenous basal protein levels of IFITMs inversely correlated to DENV\u20102 infection, and induction of IFITMs in cells with low basal protein levels was sufficient to drive protection of host cells from DENV\u20102 infection at entry. Conversely, loss of IFITM in host cell pronouncedly enhanced DENV\u20102 infection. Most importantly, our study for the first time demonstrated the presence of IFITM\u2010containing exosome in the extracellular environment and the function of these exosome vehicles for inter\u2010cellular transmission of anti\u2010viral proteins.",

Notably, following infection with DENV\u20102 at multiplicity of infection (moi) of 2 in 9 human cell lines permissive for DENV\u20102 replication, expression of IFITM3 was found to be inducible by DENV\u20102 infection in various cell lines as demonstrated by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1A). Next, we analysed the correlation of IFITM3 level in 8 cell lines with DENV\u20102 infection. We found that while endogenous IFITM3 expression was varied in different cell lines, cells expressing low level of IFITM3 protein were more susceptible to DENV\u20102 infection (Fig. 1B). Further exponential regression analysis showed that the level of IFITM3 protein in host cells inversely correlated with their susceptibility to DENV\u20102 infection significantly (r\n2 = 0.591, P = 0.026, n = 8, Fig. 1C), suggesting that IFITM3 might be an important cellular restriction factor for DENV infection.",

As show in http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12339/suppinfo, IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 overexpression drastically diminished the number of DENV\u20102\u2010infected cells, as indicated by twofold to fourfold reduction of DENV\u20102 viral E protein accumulation in virally infected U937 and HeLa cells. Similar profound restriction was also seen when IFITM3 was transiently transduced in 293T, despite a lesser extent of IFITM3 overexpression than that of IFITM1 or IFITM2 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12339/suppinfo), demonstrating the potency of IFITM3 in conferring host cells resistance to DENV infection. We next examined the effect of IFITM3 on the entry step of DENV\u20102, and found that entry of DENV\u20102 was reduced by IFITM3 by approximately twofold (Fig. 5A), as controlled with the 4G2 monoclonal neutralizing antibody to demonstrate a successful entry blockage, suggesting that the disruption of DENV replication by IFITM3 was associated with a targeted abrogation of viral entry.",

As shown in http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12339/suppinfo, compared with HUVEC cells transfected with control scramble siRNA, transfection of IFITM3\u2010siRNA\u20101 and IFITM3\u2010siRNA\u20102 efficiently depleted basal\u2010level IFITM3 expression, and increased the permissiveness of the transfected cells to DENV\u20102 infection, as indicated by a > 2\u2010fold increase of infection, in HUVEC that constitutively express high basal level of endogenous IFITM3 expression. Similar effect of IFITM3 depletion was reproducible in another cell model, in which the basal IFITM3 level is low but greatly inducible by IFN\u2010\u03b1. siRNA silencing of IFITM3 markedly attenuated the protective effect of IFN\u2010\u03b1 against DENV\u20102 infection in HeLa cells, leading to profoundly increased infection by DENV\u20102 in the presence of IFN\u2010\u03b1, by 5.9\u2010 or 7.2\u2010fold (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12339/suppinfo), indicating that the depletion of IFITM3 could decrease the antiviral actions of IFN\u2010\u03b1. We also performed DENV binding/entry assay following knockdown of IFITM3 expression. Our results showed no effect of siRNA silencing of IFITM3 on the binding of DENV\u20102 to HeLa cells, but the penetration of DENV\u20102 into cells was significantly promoted by the depletion of IFITM3 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12339/suppinfo).

To achieve this, exosomes were prepared from the culture media of HUVEC, HUVEC\u2010siNC cells, HUVEC\u2010siIFITM3 cells, IFN\u2010\u03b1\u2010treated 293T cells (293T\u2010IFN), 293T\u2010IFITM3 cells, 293T\u2010Vector cells and 293T cells, and subjected to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The electron microscopic examination of the exosomes revealed vesicles ranging in size from 30 nm to 100 nm (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, IFITM3 was detected in exosomes purified from the culture supernatant of HUVEC and HUVEC\u2010siNC cells, and was also abundant in those produced by 293T\u2010IFITM3 or 293T\u2010IFN cells. In contrary, however, exosomes isolated from the 293T cells, 293T\u2010vector cells and HUVEC\u2010siIFITM3 cells did not contain detectable IFITM3 (Fig. 2F). Purified exosomes were further characterized for the presence of conventional markers for exsosomes, namely, flotillin\u20102 and CD63, and non\u2010exosomal markers calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum marker) and GM130 (Golgi matrix marker) using Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 2F, exosomes collected from each group was shown to be positive for flotillin\u20102 and CD63, but negative for calnexin and GM130, verifying that there is no contamination by other subcellular fractions in the purified exosome preparations. The IFITM3 protein contained in exosome composition was further verified by mass spectrometry (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12339/suppinfo). Together, our data demonstrate that secretion of IFITM3 in exosome is not limited to HUVEC that express high level of endogenous IFITM3, but also by 293T cells undergoing IFN stimulation or transiently expressing exogenous IFITM3.",

In this study, we tested such a possibility by incubating HeLa cells, which express a low\u2010level of IFITM3, with exosomes collected from HUVEC, HUVEC\u2010siNC, HUVEC\u2010siIFITM3, 293T\u2010IFITM3 or 293T\u2010IFN cells.

Notably, as it was reported that exosomes might be capable of delivering exogenous small RNA such as siRNA and microRNA in vitro and in vivo (van den Boorn et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2012; Shtam et al., 2013), in this experiment we preformed the protein transfer assay in recipient HeLa cells transfected with IFITM3\u2010siRNA (HeLa\u2010siIFITM3) to rule out the potential side\u2010effect of IFITM3\u2010siRNA possibly delivered by exosomes on the endogenous or exosome\u2010delivered IFITM mRNA in the recipient cells, Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3B and D, increased abundance of IFITM3 was detected in the recipient HeLa\u2010siIFITM3 cells treated with HUVEC\u2010siNC\u2010derived exosomes in a time\u2010dependent manner, but not in those treated with HUVEC\u2010siIFITM3 cell\u2010derived exosomes.",

In contrast, our results showed that 293T\u2010IFITM3 cell\u2010derived exosomes did not change IFITM1 and IFITM2 expression in the recipient HeLa cells, when compared with treatments of 293T cell\u2010 or 293T\u2010Vector cells\u2010derived exosomes (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12339/suppinfo). Moreover, when the exosome treatments were terminated at 12 h, further incubation with blank culture media for a total length of 24 or 48 h did not increase the amount of endogenous IFITM3 within the recipient HeLa cells (Fig. 3F), suggesting that the exosome treatment procedure per se does not change endogenous IFITM3 expression in the recipient HeLa cells. In addition, in order to verify that the increased IFITM3 protein level in the transfer recipient cells was due to the exosomal transfer of IFITM3, rather than a stimulated expression of endogenous IFITM3, we measured IFITM3 mRNA levels in cells treated with IFITM3\u2010exosomes using quantitative real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR, and we found that IFITM3\u2010exosome treatment did not induce an increase of endogenous IFITM3 mRNA in HeLa cells (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, to evaluate the half\u2010life of IFITM3 in cell culture supernatant, we quantified IFITM3 protein in the supernatant of cultured HUVEC at various time points (0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h) using Western blotting. Specifically, supernatants derived from HUVEC cells were collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min, and then further centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cells and cell debris, followed by filtration with 0.22 \u03bcm filters.

As shown in the http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12339/suppinfo, there was no or little change of the IFITM3 protein in the supernatant within 72 h, indicating a long half\u2010life (> 72 h) of IFITM3 protein in the supernatant.",

Purified IFITM3\u2010containing exosomes were used to treat HeLa cells that were simultaneously infected with DENV\u20102 (moi = 2). At 24 h post infection when the infected cells were examined by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay, strikingly, DENV\u20102 infection was suppressed potently by the IFITM3\u2010containing exosomes in a dose\u2010dependent manner in parental HeLa cells (Fig. 4A) or in HeLa cells with endogenous IFITM3 knocked down (Fig. 4C), and the copy number of DENV\u20102 viral RNA was reduced in the culture supernatant (Fig. 4B and D), indicating that the observed antiviral effect was mediated by the exosome\u2010transferred IFITM3. We also performed immunofluorescence analysis of infected HeLa cells treated with, or without, IFITM3\u2010exosomes, by staining for delivered IFITM3\u2010Flag and a DENV protein E. As shown in http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cmi.12339/suppinfo, our results showed that DENV protein E are present only in some cells that do not contain IFITM3\u2010Flag. The data from the CPE reduction assay demonstrated that IFITM3\u2010laden exosomes also attenuated CPE triggered by DENV\u20102 infection (Fig. 4E). Moreover, our results showed no effect of IFITM3\u2010exosomes on the binding of DENV\u20102 to host cells or post\u2010entry steps during DENV\u20102 infection, but the penetration of DENV\u20102 into cells was significantly inhibited by the IFITM3\u2010 containing exosomes, with a reduction of approximately fourfold (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the control exosomes prepared from 293T cells that contained only the vector plasmid without the IFITM3 expression cassette did not exhibit any anti\u2010DENV activity, suggesting that IFITM3 was the main exosomal component responsible for the detected antiviral activity of exosome.",

Accordingly, ISGs represent a key line of defence against viral infection, and IFITMs are among the most potent ISG products with broad anti\u2010viral spectra. A key finding of our current study, namely, that IFITM3 can be transferred intercellularly via extracellular exosome, provides new insights in the functional significance of IFITM3 as an IFN\u2010induced anti\u2010viral protein. The discovery of the roles of free IFITM proteins and IFITM\u2010laden exosome as innate cellular defenders present an opportunity developing exosome\u2010based tools to actively combat existing or emerging pathogens.

By transferring proteins, mRNAs and microRNAs to neighbouring or distant cells, exosome contribute to modulation of important physiological or pathological processes such as immunity, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion, and cell\u2010to\u2010cell signalling (Schorey and Bhatnagar, 2008). Here, we propose a novel model for IFN\u2010inducible innate immune response against DENV\u20102 infection mediated by IFITM\u2010containing exosome. Noteworthy in this context is that exosome released from IFN\u2010treated cells may remotely communicate with other cells through such a mechanism that the anti\u2010viral phenotype can be transferred to the exosome recipient cell that might not have the chance to be directly stimulated by IFN. Interestingly, this inter\u2010cellular communication model might also be applicable to explain a pioneering observation on the antiproliferative activity transmitted from IFN\u2010stimulated cells to non\u2010stimulated cells (Lloyd et al., 1983). At the subcellular level, following IFN induction of IFITM3 expression, IFITM3 is transferred to the multivesicular complexes and assembled into exosomal vesicles. Upon transport to the surface of a recipient cell, fusion of MVCs with the plasma membrane allows assembly of IFITM with a pre\u2010existing exosome receptor complex that is unknown thus far. Potentially, the released exosome particles containing IFITM protein can travel to non\u2010stimulated cells where receptor assembly also occurs. Such a model is consistent with the finding that the antiviral state can be transferred from IFNs induced cells to non\u2010treated cells in culture.",
