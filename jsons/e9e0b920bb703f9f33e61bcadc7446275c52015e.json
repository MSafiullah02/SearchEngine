This is true even where there is a commitment to tackling \"upstream\" determinants (Popay, Whitehead, & Hunter, 2010) . To illustrate, there has been recent criticism of the Chief Medical Officer's report on child health focusing on \"health-care\" services and \"individual-level targets\" and its failure to suggest action on wider issues (Tillmann, Baker, Crocker-Buque, Rana, & Bouquet, 2014) .",

Just as in England, it is argued that Ontario's public health units have generally neglected the social determinants of health (Brassolotto, increasingly involved in tackling other public health issues such as obesity. Rehfuess and Bartram (2014) suggest a useful definition of EH interventions: \"any modifications to the natural or physical environment, or behaviours relating directly to them, which are undertaken with the intention to protect or improve public health\" (p. 155).

There remain tensions in meeting these often narrow regulatory requirements and leading on wider public health, both in policy and practice. Rather than taking an holistic approach, EH has tended to fragment into administrative silos, including food safety, occupational health and safety, housing and environmental protection, and in what has been described as \"action-oriented\" fields (Eyles, 1997) . This, coupled with the challenges of measuring the effectiveness of action on complex public health issues in the short-term (Bauld & Judge, 2008) , presents difficulties in developing the evidence base required to persuade decision-makers of the legitimacy and cost-effectiveness of proactive interventions. Consequently, there has been a substantial impact on the ability to adopt an evidence-based system in EH. The development of an evidence base for tackling the social determinants of health, and an evidence base for EH are separate issues. However, they are also highly interlinked and interdependent. We therefore address them together here.",

This followed historical restructuring in 1974, when public health medicine joined the National Health Service (Byrne, 1994; Stewart, Bushell, & Habgood, 2003) , leaving EH in local authorities, contributing to challenges we describe. Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) went live at the same time as the restructure; these are local government led committees charged with setting the local strategic direction for health, including public health, bringing together representatives from health and local authorities. The new system has required all public health professionals, whether formerly health service or local authority based, to work more closely to improve health and well-being and tackle health inequalities in their local populations (Department of Health, 2012). However, EH practitioners do not have a secure and mandated place on HWBs and have been found to be largely \"invisible\" to their colleagues in the wider public health system (Dhesi, 2014) .",

Importantly, observers have noted that funding for health promotion activities is now linked to evidence-based practice and that \"this is now the norm\" (Dunne, Scriven, & Furlong, 2012, p. 109) . However, they add that the evaluation of work to create this evidence base requires investment, and it is clear that work is required in both policy and practice to establish the effectiveness of preventative strategies and interventions which are the core of EH work.",

Evidence doesn't exist in a vacuum-how it is presented and by whom are key issues which can determine its value and uptake. Even where respected evidence resources exist . . . awareness of them remains poor in many local authorities. And getting their findings into practice locally can be problematic. (D. Hunter et al., 2014) D. J.

Marks (2002) identifies \"three factors commonly held to have influenced the shift towards evidence based practice in the UK are cost-containment, quality assurance and the purchaser/provider split in the internal market of the NHS\" (p. 5), and it may be for this latter reason that a medical model still prevails. Another likely factor is the period of time the medical evidence base has been relied upon and added to, while other evidence bases-for example, in public health, where the situation is often more empirically complex and less easy to tease apart-have lagged behind. As we have described, these areas have developed outside health services and have different and complex functions. In addition, the time lag between interventions and outcomes for public health interventions can be significant, a challenging issue in such a fast moving policy context, where initiatives are often time-limited and subject to change.",

Elements of the regulatory frameworks in which they operate are not necessarily health outcome specific, for example, performance measurement on the numbers of food hygiene or occupational health and safety inspections carried out. Although hazard and risk have become increasingly factored into regulation, other issues such as a requirement to enhance social capital or community cohesion are not. Prioritizing of regulation in some areas, often as a result of policies of austerity, has left little space for a wider focus in the social determinants of health for those at the front line of EH practice where there is potential for greater health impact. What is lacking is the routine use of, and contribution to, a robust evidence base to shape how EH practitioners tackle the social determinants of health on which their daily work is focused, in ensuring safe living and working conditions for their local populations.",

However, there are some signs that EH practitioners and managers feel that by evaluating their work in terms of outcomes, they will be able to demonstrate the health impacts, and there are indications that some public health decision-makers will be open to this evidence in terms of service funding, including, for discretionary work addressing the social determinants of health. There also needs to be an acknowledgment that time is needed for these activities as part of the \"day job\" if the best use of limited resources is to be identified. However, the value of \"gray\" literature such as technical reports, opinion pieces, and other unpublished work compared with peer-reviewed papers remains unclear in the practical context. Recent housing case studies have been published (Stewart, 2013) and housing \"evidence bases\" are available; however, it is unclear whether gray literature will be accepted as \"evidence\" sufficient to influence decision making and funding, and more research is needed. Rehfuess and Bartram (2014) suggest a new five-stage model for evidence synthesis on EH intervention effectiveness. They take into account the complexity of action on upstream interventions, including the \"geographical, socioeconomic, political and cultural environment.\" The five stages are policy measures, programming, delivery, user compliance, and direct impact. While clearly requiring resources to action, it appears that this could be a useful tool for EH practitioners and managers in the new English public health system to make progress in a systematic way with demonstrating the value of their interventions in terms of public health outcomes.",

EH professionals recognize this deficit, and while they may not all agree on the value of evidence-based practice in itself, they see that being able to demonstrate effectiveness in this way is necessary to survive and thrive sufficient to take action on upstream issues, particularly where these actions fall outside the narrow regulatory remit. Interestingly, none of those interviewed referred to the former modes of support for best practice dissemination in local government, which have declined in recent years. There is some optimism among interviewees that the evidence base can be developed, particularly if efforts are made to work with other public health colleagues more familiar with the concept, but in a way that is valid and responds to both theory and practice in EH and health promotion more widely.
