To implement these activities, proteins function only if they interact with each other. Enzyme catalytic activity, acetylation, methylation, glycosylation, and phosphorylation are typical protein functions through binding. Studying how to recognize functional sites is then a fundamental topic in bioinformatics research. As proteins function only when they are bound together, the binding sites (functional sites) and their surrounding residues in substrates are the basic components for functional recognition.",

            "text": "The earlier work was to investigate a set of experimentally determined (synthesized) functional peptides to find some conserved amino acids, referred to as motifs. Based on these motifs, biologists can scan any newly sequenced proteins to identify potentially functional sites prior to further experimental confirmation. In some cases, a functional site occurs between two residues in a substrate peptide, such as protease cleavage sites. A peptide with ten residues can be expressed as P5-P4-P3-P2-P1-P1'-P2'-P3'-P4'-P5' with a functional site located between P1 and P1'. The other eight residues\u2014P5, P4, P3, P2, P2', P3', P4', and P5'\u2014 called the flanking residues, are also essential for functional recognition. In some situations, asymmetrical peptides may be used. For instance, tetra-peptides P3-P2-P1-P1' are used in trypsin cleavage site prediction [1]. Protein functional sites can also involve one residue for most posttranslational protein modifications; for instance, phosphorylation sites [2] and glycosyslation sites [3] occur at only one residue. In this situation, we can express a peptide with nine residues as P4-P3-P2-P1-P0-P1'-P2'-P3'-P4', where the functional site is at residue P0. The other eight residues are the flanking residues and are again essential for functional recognition. Note that the peptide size is commonly determined by substrate size necessary for chemical reactions. For example, trypsin protease cleavage activity requires four residue long peptides for proper recognition, while hepatitis C virus protease cleavage activity requires ten residue long peptides for proper recognition. The importance of studying protease cleavage sites can be explained by drug design for HIV-1 proteases. Figure 9.1 shows the principle for HIV-1 virus production. New proteases are matured and function through cleavage to produce more viruses. The nucleus of an uninfected cell can be infected by reverse transcriptase. To stop the infection of uninfected cells and stop maturation of new proteases, it is important to design inhibitors to prevent the cleavage activities that produce new protease and reverse transcriptase. Without knowing how substrate specificity is related to cleavage activity, it is difficult to design effective inhibitors.\n",

For instance, we may have peptides whose lengths vary from one residue to a couple of hundreds residues long when we try to identify disorder regions (segments) in proteins [5]. Figure 9.2 shows two cases, where the shaded regions indicate some disorder segments. The curves represent the probability of disorder for each residue. The dashed lines show 50% of the probability and indicate the boundary between order and disorder. It can be seen that the disorder segments have various lengths. The importance of accurately identifying disorder segments is related to accurate protein structure analysis. If a sequence contains any disorder segments, X-ray crystallization may fail to give a structure for the sequence. It is then critically important to remove such disordered segments in a sequence before the sequence is submitted for X-ray crystallization experiments. The study of protein secondary structures also falls into the same category as disorder segment identification, where the length of peptides that are constructs for secondary structures varies [6].\n",

            "text": "The orthogonal vector method encodes each amino acid using a 20-bit long binary vector with 1 bit assigned a unity and the rest zeros [8]. Denoted by s a peptide, a numerical vector generated using the orthogonal vector method is x \u2208 b\n20\u00d7|s|, where b = {0, 1} and |s| is the length of s. The introduction of this method greatly eased the difficulty of peptide classification in the early days of applying various machine learning algorithms like neural networks to various peptide classification tasks. However, the method significantly expands the input variables, as each amino acid is represented by 20 inputs [9, 10]. For an application with peptides ten residues long, 200 input variables are needed. Figure 9.3 shows such an application using the orthogonal vector method to convert amino acids to numerical inputs. It can be seen that data significance, expressed as a ratio of the number of data points over the number of model parameters, can be very low. Meanwhile, the method may not be able to properly code biological content in peptides. The distance (dissimilarity) between any two binary vectors encoded from two different amino acids is always a constant (it is 2 if using the Hamming distance or the square root of 2 if using the Euclidean distance), while the similarity (mutation or substitution probability) between any two amino acids varies [11\u201313]. The other limitation with this method is that it is unable to handle peptides of variable lengths. For instance, it is hard to imagine that this method could be used to implement a model for predicting disorder segments in proteins.\n",

We use the term indicator peptides, because the use of some indicator peptides transform a training peptide space to an indicator or feature space for modeling. We then calculate the nongapped pairwise homology alignment scores using the Dayhoff mutation matrix [12] to calculate the similarities among all the functional/positive and these two indicator peptides as well as the similarities among all the nonfunctional/negative peptides and these two indicator peptides.

In Fig. 9.7, there are two classes of peptides, A and B. The four open circles of class A and four filled circles of the class B are distributed in balance. With this set of peptides, the true hyperplane separating two classes of peptides, represented as circles, can be found as in Fig. 9.7(a). Suppose a shaded large circle belonging to class B as a noise peptide is included, as seen in Fig. 9.7(b); the hyperplane (the broken thick line) is biased because the error (distance) between the nine circles and the hyperplane has to be minimized. Suppose a shaded circle belonging to class A as a noise peptide is included as seen in Fig. 9.7(c); the hyperplane (the broken thick line) also is biased. With theses biased hyperplanes, the novel peptides denoted by the triangles could be misclassified.\n",

These peptides are referred to as support peptides. In constructing a SPM classifier, the support peptides are closest to the hyperplane within the slat formed by two boundaries (Fig. 9.7d) and are located on the boundaries of the margin between two classes of peptides. The advantage of using an SPM is that the hyperplane is searched through maximizing this margin. Because of this, the SPM classifier is robust; hence, it has better generalization performance than neural networks. In Fig. 9.7(d), two open circles on the upper boundary and two filled circles on the lower boundary are selected as support peptides. The use of these four circles can form the boundaries of the maximum margin between two classes of peptides. The trained SPM classifier is a linear combination of the similarity between an input peptide and the found support peptides. The similarity between an input peptide and the support peptides is quantified by the bio-basis function. The decision is made using the following equation, y = sign {\u03a3w\ni\nt\ni\nK(s, r\ni)}, where t\ni is the class label of the ith support peptide and w\ni the positive parameter as a weight for the ith support peptide. The weights are determined by a SPM algorithm [31].",

Although some efficient models and integrated HIV vaccine research enterprises have been proposed [36], there is little hope that an HIV vaccine would be developed before 2009 [37]. HIV is a type of retrovirus. It can enter uninfected cells to replicate itself. Inhibiting viral maturation and viral reverse transcription are then the major methods so far for treating HIV-infected patients. Two groups of inhibitors have since been developed. One group aims to stop protease cleavage activities and is referred to as the protease inhibitor.

The emergence of drug resistance remains one of the most critical issues in treating HIV-1-infected patients [39]. The genetic reason for drug resistance is the high mutation rate along with a very high replication rate of the virus. These two factors work together, leading to the evolution of drug-resistant variants and consequently resulting in therapy failure. The resistance to HIV-1 protease inhibitors can be analyzed at a molecular level with a genotypic or a phenotypic method [39, 40]. The genotypic method is used to scan a viral genome for some mutation patterns for potential resistance. As an alternative, the viral activity can be measured in cell culture assays. Yet another alternative, phenotypic testing is based on clinic observations, ithat is, directly measuring viral replication in the presence of increasing drug concentration.",

The use of such tools is based on the principle that the complex impact of amino acid substitutions in HIV reverse transcriptase or protease on the phenotypic susceptibility or clinical response to the 18 available antiretroviral agents is observable [41]. Genotypic assays are used to analyze mutations associated drug resistance or reduced drug susceptibility. However, this method is problematic, because various mutations and mutational patterns may lead to drug resistance [39], and therefore the method occasionally fails to predict the effects of multiple mutations [42]. In addition, genotypic assays provide only indirect evidence of drug resistance [43]. Although HIV-1 genotyping is widely accepted for monitoring antiretroviral therapy, how to interpret the mutation pattern associated with drug resistance to make accurate predictions of susceptibility to each antiretroviral drug is still challenging [44]. Phenotypic assays directly measure drug resistance [43], where drug resistance can be experimentally evaluated by measuring the ratio of free drug bound to HIV-1 protease molecules. However, this procedure is generally expensive and time consuming [39, 42].",

From this, an inhibitory constant is calculated for prediction [39]. Later, some statistical models were established for predicting drug resistance. For instance, a statistical model was proposed to analyze the viral and immunologic dynamics of HIV infection, taking into account drug-resistant mutants and therapy outcomes [45]. The factors causing the increase in CD4 cell count and the decrease in viral load from baseline after six months of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) were analyzed. Note that CD4 stands for cluster of differentiation 4, which is a molecule expressed on the surface of T helper cells. In addition to the baseline viral load and CD4 cell count, which are known to affect response to therapy, the baseline CD8 cell count and resistance characteristics of detectable strains are shown to improve prediction accuracy. Note that CD8 stands for cluster of differentiation 8, which is a membrane glycoprotein found primarily on the surface of cytotoxic T cells. A logistic regression model was built for the prediction of the odds of achieving virology suppression after 24 weeks of HAART in 656 antiretroviral-naive patients starting HAART according to their week 4 viral load [46]. A regression model was built on a set of 650 matched genotype-phenotype pairs for the prediction of phenotypic drug resistance from genotypes [47]. As it was observed that the range of resistance factors varies considerably among drugs, two simple scoring functions were derived from different sets of predicted phenotypes. The scoring functions were then used for discrimination analysis [48].",

In the model, a set of rules predicting genotypic resistance was initially derived from an expert and implemented using a fuzzy logic approach. The model was trained using the virological outcomes data set, that is, Stanford's HIV drug-resistance database (Stanford HIVdb). Expert systems were also used for this purpose [41]. Neural networks as a type of powerful nonlinear modelers were utilized to predict HIV drug resistance for two protease inhibitors, indinavir and saquinavir [50].",

The susceptibility of the data to five protease inhibitors were determined, saquinavir (SQV), indinavir (IDV), ritonavir (RTV), nelfinavir (NFV) and amprenavir (APV). We obtained 255 genotype-phenotype pairs for each of the protease inhibitor, except for APV, for which we obtained 112 pairs. Phenotypic resistance testing measures in-vitro viral replication of the wild type and the viral sample in increasing drug concentrations [52]. The resistance factor, defined as the ratio of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the respective viral sample to IC50 of the nonresistant reference strain, reports the level of resistance as the fold change in susceptibility to the drug as compared to a fully susceptible reference strain. While genotypic resistance testing is done by scanning the viral genome for resistance-associated mutations. The major and minor mutations observed in a resistant HIV protease can be seen in Figure 1 in [53]. HIV protease is an aspartyl protease with 99 residues. In this study, we considered major and minor mutation sites, obtaining a window size of 20 residues for each drug. We divided the sample set into two classes by attaching to each peptide a label 1 or \u20131 for resistant (functional) and susceptible (nonfunctional), respectively. This division depended on whether the resistance factor of a sample exceeded the cutoff value or not. Based on previously published datasets and studies, we assumed the cutoff value for the resistant factor of each sample with respect to each protease inhibitor to be 3.5.",

            "text": "A very important issue must be discussed here, especially for peptide classification. Many peptide classification tasks deal with functional site predictions. Within each protein sequence, there might be a few functional sites, such as protease cleavage sites, protein interaction sites, or protein posttranslational modification sites. Based on the substrate size, we can extract a peptide around one functional site. Such a peptide is commonly regarded as a functional peptide. To conduct proper peptide classification, we have to have a set of nonfunctional peptides. Each nonfunctional peptide has no functional site at the desired residue(s). We normally use a sliding window with a fixed length to scan a protein sequence from the N-terminal to the C-terminal, one residue by one residue to generate no-functional peptides. A commonly used method is to combine both functional and nonfunctional peptides to produce a data set. Suppose we use the cross-validation method, the data set is then randomly divided into m folds for cross-validation. One then builds m validation models for model evaluation and model selection. Now a question arises. When we use such kind of models for testing on novel whole protein sequences, the performance is commonly not as expected. This means that the model is some where overfitted. If model parameter estimation follows a proper procedure, the most probable problem is the data used for training and validation. We mentioned previously that we must maintain the independence of a validation data set from a training data set. When we check the method as described, we can clearly see two interesting facts. First, a training peptide and a validation peptide may come from the same protein. If one protein has conserved amino acids, the validation peptides generated this way may not be independent of the training peptides. Second, a training peptide and a validation peptide may have many identical residues if they are extracted from neighboring sliding widows.",

When new experimentally determined peptides have been collected, the exiting models must be corrected so that they can conduct classification tasks well. In this section, we investigate an interesting peptide classification topic, where we can use a model built on published peptides for peptide classification, and we can use a model built on both published peptides and newly submitted sequences in NCBI (www.ncbi.nih.gov) for peptide classification.

Two resources are available for modeling. First, research articles have published experimentally determined peptides, cleaved and noncleaved. Second, some databank like NCBI has collected many new submissions. Each submission contains a whole protein sequence with a number of experimentally determined cleavage sites. In terms of this, there are two strategies for modeling. If we believe that the published peptides are able to represent all the protease cleavage specificity, we can select indicator peptides from these published peptides for modeling. We refer to a model constructed this way as a Type-I model. In fact, viruses mutate very rapidly; hence, the published peptides may not be able to represent the cleavage specificity in the recent submissions to NCBI. We can then select more indicator peptides, which show more viral mutation information from the new sequences downloaded from NCBI to build a more informative model referred to as a Type-II model.\n",

This is the reason that the peptide machines outperformed the other machine learning approaches. The chapter also discussed some issues related with peptide classification, such as model evaluation, protein-oriented validation, and model lifetime. Each of these issues is important in terms of building correct, accurate, and robust peptide classification models. For instance, the blind test can be easily missed by some new bioinformatics researchers. Protein-oriented validation has not yet been paid enough attention in bioinformatics.
