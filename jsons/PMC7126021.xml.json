            "text": "The future of the logistics services industry will be faced with many obstacles as well as opportunities. The industry is currently experiencing strong growth rates, but is also confronted with major challenges in an increasingly complex and dynamic environment. Intensifying globalisation, stronger competition, higher customer demands and resource scarcity are just a few of the factors that lead to a more turbulent and uncertain environment. Given the potential negative impact of these factors, an analysis of future requirements is required to foster innovations in logistics in order to maintain competitiveness and the ability to adapt to changes (Halld\u00f3rsson and Kov\u00e1cs, 2010, Flint et al., 2005, Soosay and Hyland, 2004, Darkow et al., 2006). Scenario planning has been identified as one of the most appropriate approaches for long-range planning and to support decisions in uncertain situations (Courtney et al., 1997, Schoemaker, 2002, Phelps et al., 2001, Powell, 1992). The positive impact of its adoption has been proven empirically. In a broader sense, 30 or more studies have examined a positive relationship between long-range planning and corporate performance over the past four decades (see e.g. Ansoff et al., 1970, Miller and Cardinal, 1994, Rhyne, 1986).",

These scenarios can support and guide managers in defining strategies contingent to potential future developments or in testing the robustness and appropriateness of strategies that are already in place. The first step in scenario planning is to systematically develop consistent and plausible scenarios. We present the results of an extensive expert-based scenario study on the future of the logistics services industry in 2025. Two specific research questions directed the design and execution of our study:(1)How will the macro-environment (political/legal, economic, socio-cultural, and technological structure) of the logistics services industry change by 2025?(2)How will the micro-environment (industrial structure) of the logistics services industry change by 2025?\n",

            "text": "Scenario development was based on a two-round Delphi survey with 30 CEOs and strategy experts of the top 50 logistics service providers in Germany. In order to do so, projections were structured according to PEST-analysis (political, economical, socio-cultural, and technological conditions related to research question 1) (see Wilson and Gilligan, 2005, p. 123) and Michael E. Porter\u2019s \u201cFive Forces Model\u201d (Porter, 1979) (related to research question 2). These projections include aspects such as the global energy consumption, resource scarcity, labour shortage, the role of emerging and developing countries, urbanisation, demographic change, social responsibility, global warming, digitisation, global networks, and large-scale outsourcing. The experts which participated in the Delphi study assessed each of these projections in terms of the probability of occurrence, the potential impact on the industry and their desirability. Based on these assessments and numerous verbal specifications and comments from the participants, different scenarios were developed. Probable scenarios for the future of the logistics services industry in 2025 were developed based on 12 projections with high probabilities of occurrence and consensus among experts; these included, for example, projections about the diminishing economic gap between emerging markets and developing countries and the still unresolved energy supply problem to foster globalisation. Furthermore, we examined surprising or unexpected scenarios, so-called discontinuities, with a low probability of occurrence but with a high impact on the industry; these include, \u201cfabbing\u201d, terrorist attacks, and the spread of pandemics.",

The number of publications has steadily increased for years. In terms of the planning horizon, we can observe a concentration of papers that considers either a range of 8\u201310 years or a planning horizon of more than 20 years. This development reflects the need for a more profound and systematic approach to manage long-term planning in the volatile and uncertain environment of the logistics services industry. The trend towards globalisation has steadily increased with the effect that supply chains have become longer and more complex (Ballou, 2004, p. 15).",

Grant et al. and Waters expect that companies will go on to focus on their core competences. As in the course of cost reduction and flexibility improvement, the vertical integration will further be reduced. On the other hand, the regional scope of production is still expanding. Therefore, information and goods flows have to be synchronised on a global level, leading to high complexity in the system. Managing these systems efficiently is one of the major challenges for the logistics services industry and reflects the need for long-term planning and scenario planning.",

            "text": "In general, scenario publications often have a quantitative focus, building on oil price development, GDP (gross domestic product) growth or transport volumes (see e.g. European Community, 2004, Stead and Banister, 2003, Sviden, 1988). Many scenarios actually include forecasts through trend extrapolations of historical data. A few publications exhibit a qualitative focus, i.e. scenarios based on a narrative description of the future (see e.g. Institute for Mobility Research (ifmo), 2002, Institute for Mobility Research (ifmo), 2005. This may be due to the fact that most of the scenario studies were intended to serve as a basis for decision makers in public policy. Especially in logistics, scenario planning often focuses on macro-environmental aspects, such as infrastructure, roadwork, transportation markets, and policies (see e.g. Piecyk and McKinnon, 2009, European Community, 2004, Stead and Banister, 2003). In the PROTRANS project, funded by the European Commission, scenarios were developed with a focus on intermodality in the European logistics services industry. Two models for the focused field of intermodal transportation were developed, which were considered in a best, average and worst case simulation (Protrans, 2003). Hardly any studies exist which consider industry scenarios to support decision making in companies (see e.g. Bergman et al., 2006). Furthermore, many studies follow a classical, functional understanding of logistics, i.e. transportation, handling, warehousing (see e.g. Duin et al., 2005, English and Keran, 1976, European Community, 2004), and scenario research so far has not focused on the logistics services industry taking a holistic, supply chain perspective into consideration.",

Purposive sampling was performed, based on databases of members of the World Future Society and Association of Professional Futurists, to find the sample of 54 futurists. The selection criteria were: technical specialisation in logistics-related fields of global issues; methodological specialisation in scenario planning; quantity and quality of publications; academic title; education; profession; and position in science or practice. These futurists identified 89 influencing factors in order to prepare the projections on the future of logistics. (4) In a similar fashion, 20 experts from specialist trend and futures consultancies were interviewed. Based on market research, organisations were identified, which offer scenario consultancy services in Germany. The sample of 24 organisations was used as a census. The experts within the organisations were selected based on the following criteria: long scenario planning experience and specialisation within the logistics field, if available in the organisation. In total, 134 factors were identified and analysed. (5) Secondary data was reviewed through desk research, of which 134 influencing factors could be determined.

Second, we ensured the avoidance of conditional statements by making the primary question dependent on the fulfilment of a series of conditions or by urging experts to evaluate the two parts of the projection in the same manner, even if they had a different opinion on each statement. If a projection was formulated with conditions, it was split into two projections. Third, a monitoring team, consisting of two researchers, separately checked and validated the contents of the analyses (Turoff, 1975, p. 93).

The third wildcard \u201cspread of a pandemic through logistics networks\u201d was an outcome of the experts\u2019 arguments within several projections. The remaining five wildcards were identified in a similar way: return of protectionism; dictatorship of data protection (e.g. prohibition of exchange, storage, and internal use of any type of individual-related data); worldwide system failure (information and communication system breakdowns); the rise of revolutionary transportation technologies; fully automated, self-monitoring logistics. Desk research revealed additional information on the selected wildcards.",

The attack on the French ocean vessel \u201cLimburg\u201d along the coast of Yemen in October 2002 proved that these fears are realistic: a boat filled with explosives rammed a hole in the starboard of the ship and 90,000 of the 400,000 barrels of oil on board poured out into the sea.

For example, some large financial institutes, such as HSBC, plan home office work on a large scale in case of emergency or rely on external providers. Deutsche Post World Net, in turn, reports of detailed emergency plans in agreement with health and regulatory agencies. Since SARS, several large industrial firms, e.g. BMW, have crisis plans in order to avoid production stops.

For 25 out of 41 projections, consensus was reached; for 9 projections consensus was already achieved in the first Delphi round.

Our discontinuity analysis came up with new, inspiring, and surprising issues although it was limited in its scope.

A scenario transfer, i.e. the usage of the scenarios for decision support, may be either active or passive.
