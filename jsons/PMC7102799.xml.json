            "text": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the commonest cause of death and disability worldwide, accounting for almost 60% of all deaths with incidence rates assuming epidemic proportions in many countries of the world [1]. Eighty percent of deaths from NCDs occur in low and middle income countries of the developing world [1] and if nothing is done to halt this trend it is projected that by 2015 deaths from NCDs may increase by 15\u201327% in these countries [2]. The aetiology of most NCDs has been linked to multiple risk factors including host genetics and immune response, lifestyle and environmental risk factors [3]. Risk factors are defined as any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual, which increase the likelihood of developing a disease or injury [4]. Physical inactivity, alcohol excess, tobacco ingestion, excessive salt ingestion, gender, age, obesity, high cholesterol and unhealthy diet and many other factors are established conventional risk factors for development of many NCDs (Table 1\n) and they remain targets for NCD preventive and control strategies [3], [4]. Over the last two decades however, there has been an emergence of novel aetiological factors (e.g. Helicobacter Pylori and peptic ulcer disease (PUD) [5]), novel risk factors (e.g. low birth weight and Type II Diabetes mellitus [6]) and novel markers (e.g. raised Homocysteine and cardiovascular diseases [7]) for many NCDs. NCDs causation can now be conceptualized as a continuum from womb to disability or death. A successful and durable NCDs preventive and control strategy therefore requires a holistic approach where all possible primary and secondary risk factors are targeted.",

NCDs on the other hand are defined as a disease or condition that has no known causative agents that are transmitted from one affected individual to another [10].

Gender and sex hormones also determine disease manifestations since androgens have been shown to promote liver carcinogenesis [13] and this may to a degree explain why Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cancer has been reported to be five times commoner in males than in females [14]. The effect of estrogens in stimulating antibody (including autoantibody) production and the effect of testosterone in depressing antibody production also partly explains the higher incidence of autoimmune diseases in females than males [15].",

This analogy is typified in the hygiene hypothesis proposed by Strachan in 1989 [23] which states that an excessively hygienic environment in early childhood may predispose some towards asthma, allergy, atopy and autoimmune diseases. Early microbial exposure is essential for normal immune development [24]. Under excessively hygienic circumstances, early childhood infections are rare and the TH (T helper) 2 cytokines arm of the T helper lymphocytes is preferentially stimulated without modulation from the TH1 cytokine arm. Hence, excessive activation of TH2 cytokine arm predisposes hygienic children to asthma and allergy. In Africa, the low incidence of autoimmune and allergic diseases have been attributed to chronic malarial parasitaemia and recurrent helminthes infestation both of which induce immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory responses that prevent allergy and autoimmune diseases [17], [24]. In a pioneering experiment by Greenwood and Voller, infection of New Zealand Black (NZB) and Fi hybrid mice with rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei yoeli suppressed the spontaneous autoimmune disease of mice of these two strains [25]. Uncritical acceptance of this hypothesis hygiene may however understate the importance of hygiene in prevention of infectious diseases. While discouraging excessive hygienic practices that eliminate the beneficial effects of surrounding microbial flora in a healthy primary immune response, effective hygienic practices that prevent clinical infection and promote healthy living should always be emphasized and promoted.",

In the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever, heart and joint symptoms develop 1\u20132 weeks after group A \u03b2 hemolytic streptococcus because the M proteins of \u03b2 hemolytic streptococcus share similar antigenic characteristics with myosin, laminin, and other matrix proteins found in the heart and joints and hence auto-antibodies are directed against these and other tissues in predisposed individuals [31].

            "text": "Twenty percent of cancers worldwide are caused by infectious agents and infections rank second only to smoking as the commonest cause of cancers worldwide [41]. Carcinogenesis is a multi-step process and infections may serve as triggers in one or more these steps [42]. In the two hit hypothesis of carcinogenesis, at least two genetic mutations are required for cancers to develop. An inherited germ-line mutation of the tumor suppressor gene can only result in cancer if there is a mutation of the second allele of the tumor suppressor gene [42]. Infections amongst other factors have been implicated in inducing these and other genetic alterations that result in cancers. The mechanism of infectious carcinogenesis may include the following:1.\nOncogene activation. Oncogenes are genes that promote cellular growth. Infectious may activate normal cellular oncogenes or may themselves express oncogenes that accelerate cell growth and result in malignancy. In the development of HBV-related primary liver cell carcinoma (PLCC), the X-protein of the virus has been postulated to directly transactivate viral genes and cellular oncogenes that promote HBV replication and also encourage tumorigenesis [43], [44]. In HPV-related cervical cancers the E5 gene of the virus is an oncogene that activates growth factors promoting carcinogenesis [18], [45]. In the aetiopathogenesis of adult T cell leukaemia, Human T lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein is an oncogene protein which activates the transcriptional factor nuclear factor \u03b2 (NF-\u03b2) that promotes T cell transformation to cancers [46]. In the same vein, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is known to induce chromosomal translocations (involving chromosomes 8; 14, or 2; 8, or 8; 22) that cause deregulation of the c-myc cellular oncogene expression and subsequent development of Burkitt's lymphoma [47]. Furthermore, the latent membrane protein 1(LMP1) and Epstein Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) are oncogene products of EBV implicated in the tumorigenesis of Hodgkin's lymphoma and other EBV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas [47]. These and several other EBV oncogene products have also been linked to the aetiopathogenesis of a number of cancers including nasopharyngeal cancers [47].2.\nLoss of tumor suppressor ability. The p53 gene and the Retinoblastoma (pRb) gene code for anti-proliferative signals that suppress cancer development by inhibiting cell division, inducing programmed cell death (also known as apoptosis) and providing the opportunity for DNA repair during a cell cycle [42]. These tumor suppressor genes may become inactivated following an infection. The E6 and E7 gene products of HPV for instance, directly promote abnormal cellular growth that result in cervical cancers by degrading the p53 protein and inactivating the pRb protein, respectively [10], [45]. Aflatoxins produced from the fungus Aspergillus flavus have also been shown to cause a mutation in codon 249 of the p53 gene and is thought to act synergistically with HBV infection in promoting development of PLCC [48], [49]. In Zaria, northern Nigeria, aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2 have been found in liver cancer tissue as well as sera of patients with PLCC [50], [51].3.\nChronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation with repeated cycles of cell death and regeneration, release of oxygen free radicals and reactive nitrogen radicals lead to DNA damage and mutations. With every subsequent mutation the risk of carcinogenesis is increased. Chronic inflammation contributes to carcinogenesis in HCV/HBV-related PLCC [39], [40] and Schistosoma haematobium-related bladder cancers [52] since infection with these agents is characterized by repeated cycles of cell necrosis and regeneration.Viruses can also promote abnormal cellular proliferation by encoding inflammatory and cell growth factors. Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) encodes a viral interleukin 6 (v-IL-6) and viral G-protein coupled receptor (v-GPCR) both possess pro-inflammatory, pro-growth factors and pro-angiogenic properties [53].4.\nEpithelial metaplasia. Infections like other carcinogens can directly cause cancers by provoking metaplasia of epithelial surfaces. This is exemplified in Helicobacter pylori-related gastric cancers where chronic atrophic gastritis results in intestinal metaplasia of the gastric mucosa with a consequent cellular dysplasia and cancer development [5]. Chronic Schistosoma haematobium infection also promotes development of squamous carcinoma of the bladder by inducing squamous metaplasia of the transitional epithelium of the bladder [52].5.Release of carcinogens. Infections may also cause release of carcinogens thereby promoting carcinogenesis. In chronic schistosomiasis and liver fluke (e.g. Chlonorchis sinesis) infestation, chronic inflammation may result in release of endogenous nitrosamines and exposure to high concentrations of this carcinogen may lead to neoplastic transformation [52]. Adult schistosome and miracidia may also directly liberate carcinogenic amines in the urine and by causing urinary stasis also concentrate urinary endogenous carcinogens. Absorption of these carcinogens may damage the bladder epithelium and promote carcinogenesis [52].6.\nImmunosuppression with loss of immunosurveillance. Infections such as HIV that cause predominant cellular immunosuppression are characteristically associated with increased risk of cancers. HIV infection results in both numerical and functional defects in both CD4 and CD8 T cells, cause dysfunctional natural killer (NK) cell, interferon gamma (INF-\u03b3) and IL-2 activities and generally provoke an unfavourable TH2 biased cytokine dysregulation [54]. The TH1 cytokines (INF-\u03b3, IL-2), natural killer cells (NK cells) and both CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes are important elements involved in tumor immunity and tumor surveillance [55]. These defects therefore predispose HIV patients to cancers including Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cervical cancers, Kaposi's sarcoma and other cancers [56]. Malaria induced immunosuppression and polyclonal B cell activation is also thought to encourage EBV transactivation and transformation of B cells characteristic of Burkiitt's lymphoma [57]. The roles of HIV or chronic malaria in triggering lymphomas when associated with EBV infection have also been linked to their ability to stimulate a TH2 B cell growth promoting cytokine profile and suppression of the TH1 tumor protective cytokines [58].\n",

In Niger, Sub-Saharan Africa, Cenac et al. suggested a possible aetiological role of Chamydiae pneumoniae in PPCF when they demonstrated a significant higher IgG seropositivity in patients with PPCF when compared to controls [70]. PPCF has also been aetiologically linked to viral myocarditis [71]. Myocardial biopsies of patients with PPCF have revealed features consistent with viral myocarditis and Coxsackie B virus is thought to be the most common cause of myocarditis in affected patients [71].",

Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy has also been ascribed to Coxsackie B virus and Toxoplasma gondii from serological studies in Africa [64]. Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) akin to Loeffler's eosinophilic endocarditis in western world is another cardiomyopathy prevalent in developing countries. Jaiyesimi [74] and Andy et al. [75], [76] in Nigeria have described EMF as a burnt out phase of helminth-induced hypereosinophilia. Microfiliaria, Trichinella Spirallis, Ascaris Hookworm, Schistosomiasis, Giardia Lamblia and Fascioliasis have been reported to be possible triggers for eosinophilia. Eosinophils induce EMF probably through the release of eosinophil basic proteins which are highly toxic to the endothelia and muscles of the heart, blood vessels and other organs [75], [76].",

A role of adenovirus in human obesity was suggested by a study in India where significantly higher prevalence rate of Ad-36 antibodies was reported in the obese humans when compared to non-obese (30% vs. 5%) [85]. Adenoviruses are thought to induce obesity by causing long-term hyperplasia and hyperproliferation of adipocytes [85].

HIV is a known cause of dementia and has been implicated in several immune-mediated neuropsychiatric manifestations including peripheral neuropathy, transverse myelitis and encephalitis [89]. Human T lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-I) is an established cause of tropical spastic paraparesis [90], [91]. Self-limiting neuropsychiatric manifestations such as peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, schizophrenia-like states, cerebellar ataxia, parkinsonism and stroke-like states may occasionally be manifestation of severe malaria and typhoid fever [92], [93], [94]. These manifestations are due to direct effects of toxic microbial products on cells of the central nervous system as well as due to effect of high levels of cytokine particularly TNF\u03b1.",

While infections have no established role in hypertensive and diabetic-related nephropathy, they are often the major aetiological drivers for glomerulonephritis particularly in developing countries where infections are highly prevalent [99], [100]. Infections can also result in kidney diseases by directly or indirectly damaging the renal parenchyma and interstitium [100]. In the entity named Tropical nephropathy, many infections have been shown to cause renal disease by invasion of the kidney/urinary tract (e.g. schistosomiasis, tuberculosis, leprosy), by direct renal injury (e.g. Salmonella) and by immune-mediated renal damage (e.g. Plasmodium spp., HBV, HCV, Yersinia enterolytica and \u03b2 hemolytic streptococcus) [99], [100]. Perhaps the earliest and the most remarkable example of how infections can result in renal disease is the Gilles and Hendrichse [101] 1963 account of Nephrosis in Nigerian children attributed to Plasmodium malariae. In a large study amongst adults and children in Uganda, Kibukamusoke et al. [102] in 1967, established a cause and effect relationship between Plasmodium malariae and nephrotic syndrome. This condition now called quartan malarial nephropathy is due to immune complex mediated damage of the kidney [21].",

Evidence for the role of house dust mite (dermatophagiodes pteronnysinus) and aspergillus flavus in triggering asthma has been suggested by a study from northern Nigeria where significant levels of IgE antibodies of these agents were found in sera of patient with asthma [107]. Some other workers have also reported significantly higher antibodies to Chlamydia pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumonia in patients with asthma than normal controls [108]. While these findings do not prove causality, they have formed the basis for ongoing research aimed at elucidating the aetiopathogenetic role of several infections in asthma.",

Malaria kills a child in Africa every 30 s and according to the WHO malaria causes 1.5\u20132 million deaths amongst children annually and 90% of these deaths occur in Africa [109]. In other to survive these attacks of malaria, a protective genetic mutation is thought to have been induced by an evolutionary pressure of malaria on the red cell genes of affected populations conferring recipients with survival and reproductive advantage over others [109], [110], [111], [112]. The evolutionary relationship between malaria and sickle hemoglobin is supported by striking coincidences in their geographical distribution [112]. By impairing malarial growth and development, the sickle cell trait (heterozygotes, AS) gives survival advantage over people with normal hemoglobin (AA) in malaria endemic regions [110]. Unfortunately individuals with homozygous state (SS) genetic red cell defects fail to attain survival advantage as they are more likely to have recurrent and severe attacks of malaria most often leading to death. This process by which the heterozygote of two alleles of a gene has an advantage over either of the homozygous states is called balanced polymorphism.",

Despite all these protective genetic mutations, the malaria parasite, like most infectious agents, is continually evolving new strategies to survive within the human host. For instance, in order to avoid the deleterious effects of oxygen radicals on parasite survival in G6PD deficiency there are reports of Plasmodium falciparum specie that produce their own G6PD [113].",

While focusing and expanding on preventing known risk factors for NCDs there is a need to identify all novel or emerging risk factors for the purpose of an integrated and unparallel NCD control strategy. As evidence gathers for a primary or precipitating role of infections in many NCDs, there is a need to re-design NCD control and preventive strategies to also include infection control while continuing to recognize NCD aetiopathogenesis as spread over a continuum. This review has brought to light the high incidences of various infections in the developing world and the contributory role of infections in programming, initiating, precipitating and promoting the development of NCDs. Consequently, an effective NCDs prevention can only be achieved in developing countries if infection controls is integrated with control of other environmental risk factors (Fig. 1\n). Understanding that infections can contribute to NCD causation from fetal life to adulthood, emphasizes the need to also include prevention of infection in pregnancy (particularly malaria) and prevention of childhood infections (by routine immunization) as integral elements of NCDs control strategy in the developing world.",

Unfortunately, there are still barriers to achieving optimal and sustainable vaccination programmes in many developing countries due to multiple factors [117]. Lack of political wills by local governments, stakeholder apathy and corruption are some examples of factors leading to failure of vaccination programmes in many areas. Inadequate coverage is usually attributed to insufficient supply or absence of vaccines, difficult to reach terrains within communities and rejection of vaccines due to religious/cultural beliefs and illiteracy. There are also problems of high cost of local production of vaccines, lack of knowledge of local antigenic serotypes for many infections and scarcity of the required expertise and technology needed for vaccine development in developing countries. Policy makers in this part of the world must therefore be prepared to re-organize and strengthen their vaccination programmes and also tackle problems confronting provision of effective vaccination. Health practitioners must be proactive in initiating research that identifies prevailing local serotypes of an infection. Non-governmental organizations and countries of the developed world have also a role in providing support and the needed technology for local vaccine development.",

This collaboration should be aimed at identifying NCD epidemiological trends, clinical manifestations and disease pathologies in relation to exposure to specific infections. Since not all infections are cultivatable, the role of the molecular biologist is to detect using molecular biotechnology, microbial \u201cfinger prints\u201d (such as microbial DNA, RNA or protein) which when detected may further strengthen the evidence suggesting a link between an infection and a NCD.
