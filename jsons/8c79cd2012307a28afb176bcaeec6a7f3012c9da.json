For example, among the healthcare workers who reported emergency care experience (i.e. over a mean of 1 h) 21% got SARS infection, while only 8% of those without emergency care experience acquired SARS, reflecting a highly significant difference between both groups. Detailed information on the contact with SARS patients were identified. Contact with respiratory secretions, sputum, pathological specimens and deceased significantly increased the ORs of SARS infection. But this was not seen for other types of contact, i.e. with faeces, blood, urine, pulmonary lavage, medical waste, nursing contact or equipment contacts ( Table 2 ). The previously reported high-risk activities were also identified in the studied subjects: Endotracheal intubation and chest compression were behaviours significantly associated with high risk for infection. The other activities, including post-mortem, intensive care unit (ICU) nursing, sample collection and chest physiotherapy, patient transferring etc. did not achieve significant results, all with P > 0.10. Two kinds of personal protective equipment were studied, face protection and body protection. Six categories of most often used masks were identified from the participating staff: disposable mask, surgical mask, 12-layer cotton surgical mask, 16-layer cotton surgical mask, N95, and higher-level protective respirator. When evaluated individually, 12-layer cotton surgical mask and 16-layer cotton surgical mask displayed significant difference of distribution between the two groups. Healthcare workers who wore glasses had about half the risk of SARS compared to those not wearing glasses (P = 0.006) ( Table 2) . A similar reduction in ORs was achieved by wearing a protective goggle when attending to patients (P = 0.046), and washing the nose after attending to patients showed an even stronger effect (P = 0.0002) (the nose wash was performed as a nasopharyngeal rinse for cleansing). Wearing gloves and multiple layers of protective gowns also each reduced the ORs of infection significantly (P = 0.011 and P = 0.052, respectively). Among the administrative factors, taking training in infection control before contact with patients and taking prophylactic medicine (including anti-viral medicine and supplemental nutrition to enhance immunity) were shown to be protective (P < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). Five significant univariate variables (contact date, wearing glasses, layers of protective clothes, wearing gloves and taking training) had missing values of >5%.

First, as in all retrospective surveys, recall bias was a concern. However, it is unlikely that ORs of this magnitude could result primarily from recall bias, since the associations shown are clear. The study was conducted shortly after the outbreak, thus minimising the information bias to which retrospective studies are otherwise susceptible. Another possible bias is that the case group attributed their infection to some high risky performance (e.g. performing intubation) and less efficient protection (wearing only one layer of mask while attending patients), while the control group did the opposite.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "During SARS epidemic in mainland China, all healthcare staff working in hospitals had been required to follow the recommended personal protection procedures. However, the risk of SARS infection, the level of precaution taken and the compliance with the standard largely depended on multiple factors, including the different time phases of patient contacts, different working areas and the various types of procedures performed. The outbreak in the hospital could be divided into two phases. In the early phase, there was a general lack of familiarity and training regarding infection-control measures among hospital staff. Medical wards and equipment were not adequately set up for the strict infection control standard. While in the later phase, after a super spreading event (SSE) occurred in the hospital, HCWs became more vigilant about protecting themselves from SARS transmission, which together with adequate training and infection control measures led to significant differences in the infection rate between subjects from before and after 2 April 2003, when the institutional infection control measures were established and enforced. We defined two phases of contact with SARS using the date of 2 April as the divide. As found in univariate analysis, early contact with SARS patients increased the ORs of SARS infection significantly.

This is consistent with previous findings (Teleman et al. 2004) , thus adding to the evidence that contact with respiratory secretions is an important risk factor. Certain types of procedures have been shown to be high-risk because they can lead to extensive spreading of droplets from the patient, for example, the use of the jet nebulizer and intubation and assisted ventilation (CDC 2003a; Ofner et al. 2003; Fowler et al. 2004 ). Our study found a significant association of infection with performing chest compression; while performing intubation showed significant correlation with the former, we cannot distinguish between these two variables given multivariate logistic regression, so both might act as factors that enhance the probability of SARS infection. However, Lau et al. (2004) showed that performing particular high-risk procedures on SARS patients was not considered to increase the disease risk.

The effectiveness of protective measures of using masks, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing, recommended under 'droplet precautions' when caring for SARS patients, was also investigated for their protection effect. Some studies show that use of any mask was associated with lower ORs of infection in healthcare-related clusters (Ruan et al. 2003; Seto et al. 2003; Nishiura et al. 2005) . One study showed that consistent use of an N95 mask was more protective than not wearing a mask or consistent use of a surgical mask (Loeb et al. 2004) . In our study, wearing a 16-layer cotton surgical mask or 12-layer surgical mask, as well as multiple layers of masks, reduced the risk of infection. However, this does not mean that the higher-level protective masks, e.g. the N95 mask, cannot cause effective protection. The counting of N95 mask use was not large enough to give a significant P-value. This might pose an important limitation leading to the failure to detect an effect, even though it may be there. The factor using more than one layer of masks was shown to be more protective than a single layer, which presents strong evidence that necessary and appropriate face protection should be advised to diminish the risk of droplet infection. The adoption of 16-layer and 12-layer cotton surgical masks individually was shown to be highly effective on risk reduction and therefore should be recommended accordingly.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 501, "end": 519, "text": "(Ruan et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 520, "end": 537, "text": "Seto et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 538, "end": 559, "text": "Nishiura et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 695, "end": 713, "text": "(Loeb et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Wearing glasses is not intended as protection, yet it indeed showed significant protective effect in univariate analysis.

In the study by Seto et al. (2003) in Hong Kong, however, gowns were found to be protective, although protection from gloves also failed to achieve statistical significance. In our final multivariate model, we explicitly tested the hypothesis that inclusion of mask over gowns and gloves was due to change but were strengthened in confidence by the fact that exchange of one set of predictors for the other seriously distorted the model. So the failure of inclusion of gowns and gloves was due to their insufficient contribution to the multivariate logistic model. However, wearing of gloves or gowns should never be downplayed because of the insignificant P-value in multivariate analysis. It should be noted that the effect of protective measures might be enhanced by beforehand training on infection control knowledge.

This happened a lot during emergency care.
