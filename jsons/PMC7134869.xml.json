Host factors include age-specific personal hygiene, immunologic maturation, and physiologic factors. Young children are known for their propensity to contaminate the environment with respiratory tract secretions, urine, and feces. Immunologically naive, they are vulnerable to infection after maternal antibodies disappear and before the development of their own protective antibodies. Eustachian tube anatomy and dysfunction caused by respiratory tract viruses contribute to otitis media, an important infectious syndrome in children in child-care facilities and the major condition for which children are given antimicrobial agents in the child-care setting.77, 87\n",

Age-mixing exposes children to pathogens that they may not come in contact with when associating with children of their own age.77 Physical characteristics such as number and location of sinks and toilets, adequacy of ventilation, and location and cleanliness of food preparation areas are important in the spread and control of organisms. Characteristics of organisms such as ability to survive outside of the host, method of transmission, virulence mechanisms, and infective dose also are important. Many organisms can be transmitted before a child is symptomatic. In other instances, children who are asymptomatic or mildly ill may be highly infectious. Respiratory tract and enteric pathogens are the most frequently encountered infectious agents in the child-care environment.

Immunocompetent persons are contagious 1 to 2 days before eruption of the rash and approximately 5 days after the onset of lesions.9 Since varicella is contagious before the onset of the rash, exclusion of infected individuals is not entirely effective at preventing spread. Children with varicella should be excluded until 6 days after the onset of rash but may return sooner if all lesions are crusted. Children or staff members with zoster should be excluded if lesions cannot be covered. Otherwise, lesions should be covered by a dressing or clothing until crusted. Handwashing should be emphasized. Parents and child-care personnel should be informed when a case of varicella occurs, educated about the possibility of fetal damage if infection occurs during pregnancy, and informed of the greater chance of serious infection in adolescents and adults. Susceptible, pregnant staff should be referred for counseling and management, preferably within 24 hours of exposure.4\n",

Specifically, disposable gloves should be used when cleaning spills of blood or body fluid; areas contaminated with blood or body fluids should be cleaned with a 1:64 diluted bleach solution (left on the surface for two minutes); avoidance of contact of open skin lesions or mucous membranes with blood or body fluids; thorough handwashing after contact with blood or body fluids; use of disposable materials for cleaning spills and disinfection of mops with a diluted bleach solution; and proper disposal of blood-contaminated material and diapers in a plastic bag with a secure tie.

Factors contributing to increased incidence of certain infections include age-specific hygiene behaviors, immunologic immaturity of young children, and exposure to pathogens with high infectivity. Respiratory tract and enteric pathogens are responsible for most illnesses, but a number of other agents are also important. Hygienic interventions, especially handwashing, remain important in infection control, but maintenance of appropriate immunization levels plays a crucial role in disease prevention in the child-care setting. Future interventions will center on development of new vaccines to eliminate susceptibility of young children to as many infectious agents as possible and continued evaluation of other preventive measures.",
