            "text": "Objective: A novel coronavirus disease 2019 was detected and has spread rapidly across various countries around the world since the end of the year 2019, Computed Tomography (CT) images have been used as a crucial alternative to the time-consuming RT-PCR test. However, pure manual segmentation of CT images faces a serious challenge with the increase of suspected cases, resulting in urgent requirements for accurate and automatic segmentation of COVID-19 infections. Unfortunately, since the imaging characteristics of the COVID-19 infection are diverse and similar to the backgrounds, existing medical image segmentation methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance. Methods: In this work, we try to establish a new deep convolutional neural network tailored for segmenting the chest CT images with COVID-19 infections. We firstly maintain a large and new chest CT image dataset consisting of 21,658 annotated chest CT images from 861 patients with confirmed COVID-19. Inspired by the observation that the boundary of the infected lung can be enhanced by adjusting the global intensity, in the proposed deep CNN, we introduce a feature variation block which adaptively adjusts the global properties of the features for segmenting COVID-19 infection. The proposed FV block can enhance the capability of feature representation effectively and adaptively for diverse cases. We fuse features at different scales by proposing Progressive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling to handle the sophisticated infection areas with diverse appearance and shapes. Results: The proposed method achieves the stateof-the-art performance. Dice similarity coefficients are 0.987 and 0.726 for lung and COVID-19 segmentation, respectively. Conclusion: We conducted experiments on the data collected in China and Germany and show that the proposed deep CNN can produce impressive performance effectively. Significance: The proposed network enhances the segmentation ability of the COVID-19 infection, makes the connection with other techniques and contributes to the development of remedying COVID-19 infection.",

The typical onset symptoms of COVID-19 patients are fever, cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and muscle aches. Despite the imposition of strict quarantine rule to limit its propagation, the COVID-19 infection has spread rapidly affecting countries worldwide. At the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 becomes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [1] . As of 11 April 2020, the WHO reported 1,610,909 worldwide cases with 99,690 deaths [2] .

However, recent reports have indicated that the sensitivity of RT-PCR might not be high enough for detecting COVID-19 [4] , [5] , which can possibly be attributed to quality, stability and insufficient viral material in specimens. On the other hand, since chest Computed tomography (CT) images captured from COVID-19 patients frequently show bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lung [6] , CT has become a vital complementary tool for detecting the lung associated with COVID-19. Comparing to RT-PCR test, chest CT is relatively easy to operate and has a high sensitivity for screening COVID-19 infection [4] . Therefore, CT could serve as a practical approach for early screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 in China. However, as the increment of confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19, manually contouring of lung lesions is a tedious and labor-intensive task. To speed up diagnosis and improve access to treatment, developing a fast automatically segmentation for COVID-19 infection is critical for the disease assessment.",

Several techniques based on deep learning have published to detect COVID19 pneumonia from CT images [14] - [17] . Wang et al. [15] developed a deep learning method that could extract COVID-19's graphical features in order to provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test. Ayrton [16] adopted the transfer learning technique with ResNet50 backbone to detect COVID-19. Wang et al. [14] introduced a deep convolutional neural network design tailored, called COVID-Net for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest radiography images. Gozes et al. [18] presented a system that utilizes 2D and 3D deep learning models, modified and adapted existing deep network models and combined them with clinical understanding. Tang et al. [19] trained a random forest (RF) model to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Shi et al. [20] proposed an infection Size Aware Random Forest method (iSARF) for classification. Shan et al. [21] developed a deep learningbased system for segmentation and quantification of infection regions from CT scans. In summary, some deep learning based methods have been proposed to detect COVID-19 and viral pneumonia in chest CT images. To our knowledge, however, only few publications have investigated the segmentation task for COVID-19 chest CT images.",

Most lesions were located peripherally, with a slight preponderance of dorsal lung areas. Due to the special structure and visual characteristics, the boundaries of COVID-19 infection regions are difficult to distinguish from the chest wall, making accurate segmentation for COVID-19 infection regions difficult. We observe that the boundaries of COVID-19 infection regions will be revealed by adjusting different parameters of window breadth and window locations in annotation processing, as shown in Fig. 1 , which can be beneficial for the COVID-19 infection image segmentation.",

The proposed method can be hugely beneficial for the early screening of patients with COVID-19. Inspired by the observation in annotation processing, the boundaries of COVID-19 infection regions are highlighted by adjusting the window breadth and window locations, we deign a Feature Variation (FV) block to handle the confusing boundaries. The central idea of the FV block is to implicitly enhance the contrast and adjust the intensity in the feature level automatically and adaptively for different images. Based on the captured features of previous layers, the FV block employs channel attention to obtain the global parameter to generate new features. In addition to the channel attention, the FV block uses spatial attention to guide the feature extraction from inputs in the encoder. Aggregating these features can effectively enhance the capability of feature representation for the segmentation of COVID-19. Furthermore, we propose a Progressive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (PASPP) to handle the challenging shape variations of COVID-19 infection areas. PASPP consists of a base convolution module followed by a cascade of atrous convolutional layers, which uses multistage parallel fusion branches to obtain the final features. Each atrous convolutional layer in PASPP only uses atrous filters with a reasonable dilation rate to cover different receptive fields. And by the progressively aggregated information from atrous convolutional layers, the information from multiple scales is effectively fused, which further promotes the performance of COVID-19 pneumonia segmentation.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , the encoder with 4 layers (i.e. E1, E2, E3, E4) obtains robust information via feature extractor and PASPP. Each layer employs residual and FV blocks as the basic operations for feature extractors, except the E4 layer. The residual block adds up the input features and the results after two convolutional layers, which effectively alleviates the vanishing gradient. To preserve multiple contextual information and enlarge the receptive field, we use PASPP with different dilate rates on the final E4 layer. After obtaining the encoded features, the decoder tries to restore the features to its original input size, which can remove the information loss induced by down-sampling from Encoder. The decoder has three layers (D3, D2, D1). Each decoder layer allows the networks to gradually propagate the global contextual information to a higher resolution layer. After a sigmoid activation function, we obtain the final segmentation of COVID-19 infection regions. In addition, the skip connection is adopted to concatenate the output features of the encoder and input features of the decoder. In this paper, the main contribution is we improve the encoder by adding FV block and PASPP block to better capture effective features. The overview of these two blocks is as follows.",

For this goal, we employ ASPP in our network and progressively fuse the features with different receptive fields. The structure of PASPP is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Given the input feature of PASPP F p in , we obtain four features F p 1 , F p 2 , F p 3 , F p 4 by four 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 convolutional layers in parallel.

In this part, we conduct experiments to study how different settings of PASPP influence the performance quantitatively. We compare the PASPP block with original ASPP and modified ResASPP (removed progressive concatenations). The results are reported in Table II , from which we obtain several conclusions. First, progressively fusing strategy is very effective for COVID-19 segmentation. We deem the reason is different scale features should not be fused at once for the sophisticated COVID-19 segmentation. With the progressively fusing, the adjacent information can better supplement the missing details. Second, compared with ASPP and ResASPP, sine the ResASPP includes residual learning, it obtains reasonably high performances. This implies that the information from the early blocks can quickly flow to the output of atrous convolutional layers, and the gradient can be quickly back-propagated to the early blocks from the atrous convolutional layers. Third, the ASPP significantly improves the segmentation performance over the UNet4.",

We were able to collect a large number of CT images from 5 hospitals, which included 861 patients with confirmed COVID-19. More importantly, we manually annotated these data by senior annotators.
