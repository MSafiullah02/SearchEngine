            "text": "An increasing body of evidence suggests the existence of an extensive correlation between inflammation and coagulation, whereby inflammation not only leads to coagulation, but coagulation also affects inflammatory activity [Keller et al., 2003; Opal, 2003; Esmon, 2004; Levi et al., 2004; Van der Poll and Levi, 2012]. Inflammation impacts the initiation, propagation and inhibitory phases of blood coagulation [Opal, 2003]. In viral and bacterial infections, this can actually lead to both thrombotic as well as hemorrhagic complications. Pathogens, as well as inflammatory cells and mediators, can induce the expression of tissue factor on monocytes and endothelial cell surfaces. Tissue factor is a major activator of coagulation [Van der Poll et al., 2011]. Direct or indirect activation of the endothelium by viruses or other pathogens may result in alterations in the coagulation and the fibrinolytic systems [van Gorp et al., 1999]. Normally, coagulation is a balance between procoagulant and (natural) anticoagulant mechanisms. A regulated activation of coagulation is part of the host's defence against infectious agents [Opal, 2003]. Inflammation may lead to altered coagulation, resulting in an imbalance between the pro\u2010 and anticoagulant state. The clinical picture of altered coagulation in several viral infections manifests itself in bleeding (hemorrhage), thrombosis, or both. An exaggerated response may even lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation with the formation of microvascular thrombi in various organs [Levi, 2007]. Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to multiple organ failure and is associated with high mortality in both bacterial and nonbacterial diseases [Levi et al., 2004; Levi, 2007]. Other syndromes associated with bacterial or viral infections are hemolytic uraemic syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [van Gorp et al., 1999]. It is not yet clear why some viruses cause hemorrhaging (e.g., Ebola), others are associated with thrombosis (e.g., cytomegalovirus) and yet others show both complications (e.g., varicella zoster virus) [Miller and Stephan, 1993; Uthman and Gharavi, 2002; Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004; Squizzato et al., 2005]. In addition to this, the bleeding complications of hemorrhagic viruses vary in severity, such as the minor bleeding complications in some forms of dengue and more severe bleeding in Ebola and Marburg. For many viral infections, targeted therapy is not available, and only supportive care can be provided. In many mild cases, treatment may not even be necessary. However, to improve therapy and supportive care for complicated viral infections, a better understanding is needed of the pathogenesis of bleeding and thrombotic complications due to viral infections. This review briefly outlines the coagulation cascade in general, as well as the interaction between the coagulation cascade and cytokines released during viral infections. Subsequently, the clinical picture of coagulation alterations seen in viral disease is reviewed. Finally, an explanation is given of the presumed mechanism of how these viruses influence hemostasis. The influence of viral infections on atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis is not discussed.",

In this review the term procoagulant is used to refer to a change in coagulation markers determined in the laboratory, while a prothrombotic state indicates a clinical risk situation. Generally speaking, in viral infections several procoagulant markers are elevated, indicating that the coagulation system is activated. A procoagulant state can be defined by a number of alterations in the blood. Firstly, there will be an increased level of clotting factors (e.g., factor VIII, factor XI), soluble tissue factor and von Willebrand factor. Secondly, the regulatory system can be deficient, which is indicated by decreased levels of the natural anticoagulants protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Furthermore, markers of thrombin generation (prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and thrombin\u2013antithrombin complexes), platelet activation, fibrin degradation and fibrinolysis (e.g., d\u2010dimer and plasmin\u2013\u03b12\u2010antiplasmin complexes) can also be increased.",

            "text": "Many studies have been carried out on the influence of inflammation, and the (pro)inflammatory cytokines on the coagulation system. The activation of the coagulation cascade during inflammation is the result of the stimulation of coagulant synthesis, the decreased synthesis of anti\u2010coagulants and the suppression of fibrinolysis [Lipinski et al., 2011]. This is the net result of an increased expression of tissue factor leading to the activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, together with the downregulation of activated protein C and the inhibition of fibrinolysis [Petaja, 2011]. Pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines like IL\u20106, IL\u20101, IL\u201012, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 are known to increase the production of von Willebrand factor, which may result in platelet activation. They upregulate tissue factor expression via the activation of protease\u2010activated receptors, on monocytes, microparticles, and endothelial cells [Opal, 2003; Levi et al., 2004; Schouten et al., 2008]. Furthermore, the generation of activated protein C is also decreased, due to a lowered expression of thrombomodulin on the surface of endothelial cells, which acts as a cofactor in the thrombin\u2010mediated activation of protein C. While on the one hand anticoagulants are decreased, on the other hand there is an upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor\u20101, which is able to block the activation of plasminogen, thus creating a decrease in the breakdown of fibrin clots [Keller et al., 2003; Opal, 2003; Schouten et al., 2008]. The generation of thrombin is generally increased due to inflammation, all of which results in a procoagulant state of the clotting cascade [Levi et al., 2012].",

            "text": "As previously described, the clinical picture of the vascular complications of viral infections consists of thrombosis and/or hemorrhage. Table I shows an overview of the clinical pathology and laboratory abnormalities seen in altered hemostasis due to viral infections. Common viruses known to cause alterations in hemostasis are discussed. The main focus is on respiratory viruses, HIV, herpes viruses, and hemorrhagic fever viruses. Respiratory tract infections increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis and possibly pulmonary embolism too [Smeeth et al., 2006]. Patients infected with the influenza A virus have been known to suffer disseminated intravascular coagulation and pulmonary microembolism [Davison et al., 1973; Harms et al., 2010]. In the recent outbreak of H1N1 influenza (\u201cswine flu\u201d), both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications were reported, such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary hemorrhage with hemoptysis, hematemesis, petechial rash, and one case of disseminated petechial brain hemorrhage [Agarwal et al., 2009; Soto\u2010Abraham et al., 2009; Adalja, 2010; Gilbert et al., 2010; Harms et al., 2010; Mauad et al., 2010; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010; Shachor\u2010Meyouhas and Kassis, 2010; Venkata et al., 2010; Bunce et al., 2011; Calore et al., 2011]. Frequently, a significant co\u2010morbidity was present, and in some reported complications a direct effect of H1N1 was uncertain. In several influenza cases intrarenal fibrin deposition was found, which lead to renal failure. H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza infections resulted in disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia in several patients [Wiwanitkit, 2008]. One study reported a number of children who developed hematemesis during influenza A infection [Armstrong et al., 1991]. How frequently influenza infection leads to clinically relevant thrombotic disease has yet to be established. RSV and adenovirus are not known to cause clinically relevant vascular complications. A relatively recent outbreak of SARS, a novel coronavirus, showed significant morbidity and mortality. The clinical picture pertaining to coagulation consisted of vascular endothelial damage in both small\u2010 and mid\u2010sized pulmonary vessels, disseminated intravascular coagulation, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboemboli resulting in pulmonary infarction [Lee et al., 2003; Chong et al., 2004; Hwang et al., 2005]. An association between CMV infection and thromboembolic disease has been established in animals [Persoons et al., 1998] and in humans, but mostly in immunocompromised patients [Maslo et al., 1997; Kazory et al., 2004; Sengul et al., 2006; Lijfering et al., 2008], with some reports being made of thrombotic events during CMV infection in immunocompetent subjects as well [Abgueguen et al., 2003; Youd et al., 2003; Squizzato et al., 2005; Delbos et al., 2007]. In several cases an additional procoagulant risk factor was present, such as a protein C deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, or a heterozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation [Bauduer et al., 2003; Fridlender et al., 2007; Lijfering et al., 2007]. Hepatitis C infections (HCV) have been associated with thrombosis. HCV was observed more frequently in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis with splanchnic venous thrombosis or thrombophlebitis than those without thrombosis, indicating that HCV infection may contribute to venous thrombosis [Squizzato and Gerdes, 2012; Violi et al., 1995].",

            "text": "Thrombocytopenia is a common hematological complication observed during HIV\u2010infection, documented numbers range from 10% to 50%. The severity of the thrombocytopenia correlates with the CD4 count. While bleeding complications are rare in HIV associated thrombocytopenia, the platelet count can remain low for a long time [Passos et al., 2010]. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in HIV\u2010infected patients was relatively common before the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy. Since the introduction of this treatment, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been a rare condition and is associated with advanced HIV disease [Becker et al., 2004]. Cardiovascular complications are reported in both acute and chronic HIV infections [Friis\u2010Moller et al., 2007]. The overall risk of venous thrombotic disease in HIV\u2010infected patients may be between two and ten times as high as it is in healthy individuals [Klein et al., 2005; Crum\u2010Cianflone et al., 2008]. The use of protease inhibitors is linked to venous as well as arterial thrombotic events [Klein et al., 2005; Friis\u2010Moller et al., 2007]. There are strong indications that the incidence rates of vascular complications in the antiretroviral era are increasing [Klein et al., 2005].",

            "text": "Whereas HIV and respiratory viruses have more thrombotic clinical complications many acute viral infections may result in bleeding. Often these pathogens are classified as hemorrhagic fever viruses with the most devastating being members of the filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg) and the arenaviruses (Lassa fever and South American hemorrhagic fever). Bleeding often occurs from various mucous membranes together with easy bruising and persistent bleeding after venapuncture. Massive bleeding may occur in the gastro\u2010intestinal tract and/or intra\u2010cerebrally [Kortepeter et al., 2011]. These bleeding complications are most frequent in severe forms of infection and they correlate with the case fatality rate. Bleeding is thought to be the consequence of an imbalanced coagulation cascade, sometimes resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation, as seen in hantavirus, Ebola, Marburg, Crimean\u2010Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Dengue infections [Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004; Bray, 2005; Laine et al., 2010]. Bleeding manifestations are most prominent in Ebola, hantavirus, and Crimean\u2010Congo hemorrhagic fever [Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004]. Thrombocytopenia is consistently found among viral hemorrhagic fever infections, as well as a decreased platelet function (thrombocytopathia) [Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004]. Known vascular complications in arenaviral infection, in addition to mucosal bleedings, are severe pleural\u2010 and pericardial effusion. The latter is also a consequence of vascular dysfunction. Disseminated intravascular coagulation does not seem to play a role in arenaviral infection [Peters et al., 1989; Richmond and Baglole, 2003].",

            "text": "Hantaviruses circulating in Europe and Asia are associated with hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome (HFRS) or the milder nephropathia epidemica (NE) variant [Khaiboullina et al., 2005a; Jonsson et al., 2010]. Hallmark symptoms of HFRS are acute kidney failure and alterations in hemostasis, ranging from mild thrombocytopenia to disseminated intravascular coagulation [Sundberg et al., 2011]. At first, less severe bleeding complications like epistaxis, conjunctival bleeding, hematuria, petechiae and mucosal bleeding occur, while in a later phase gastrointestinal, intra\u2010cerebral and pleural bleedings are reported in severe HFRS. Less common hemorrhagic events are right atrial hemorrhage [Chun and Godfrey, 1984], spleen hemorrhage [Alexeyev et al., 1994] and pituitary gland hemorrhage resulting in endocrinal disturbance or even panhypopituitarism [Suh et al., 1995; Pekic et al., 2005]. Hantaviruses circulating in North and South America can cause the hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, resulting in acute respiratory distress and thrombocytopenia. However, bleeding disorders play a less significant role in the pathology of this disease. Dengue virus, one of the most widespread mosquito\u2010borne viruses worldwide and with an annual infection rate around 50\u2013100 million, used to be subdivided into dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [WHO, 1997]. The most recent classification breaks down dengue patients into non\u2010severe dengue cases, with or without warning signs, and severe dengue cases. The latter are patients presenting with either shock, respiratory distress, severe organ impairment or severe bleeding [van de Weg et al., 2012]. The occurrence of severe dengue with bleeding or signs of shock differs all over the world. Therefore, it is assumed that the interaction between host, virus, vector, and environment defines the clinical presentation and outcome. Although thrombocytopenia has been well documented in dengue infection [Sosothikul et al., 2007], no association has been established between the presence of active bleeding and the degree of thrombocytopenia on admission. Bleeding symptoms in dengue cases often start with petechiae, bleeding from the mucous membranes and epistaxis while in severe cases typically large gastrointestinal bleedings may occur. Recently, an outbreak of a novel bunyavirus caused a clinical syndrome described as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Patients rapidly developed thrombocytopenia, accompanied with multiple organ dysfunction and gastrointestinal complaints. The case fatality rate was estimated around 16% [Zhang et al., 2012].",

            "text": "Platelets are the key players in primary hemostasis; the formation of the platelet plug. Reduced platelet function, as well as diminished production or destruction of platelets, is a well\u2010documented phenomenon in several viral infections. Thrombocytopenia often occurs in both hemorrhagic and non\u2010hemorrhagic viral infections. In most cases, thrombocytopenia is caused by autoimmune antibodies against platelets. Other proposed mechanisms include the increased adherence and activation of platelets, which leads to the consumption of platelets, and the infection of bone marrow directly affecting megakaryocytic, and thus the production of platelets. Thrombocytopenia caused by autoantibodies has been described in SARS, influenza, chronic parvovirus B19, herpes virus, CMV, VZV, Epstein Barr virus, HIV, and hepatitis A virus and hepatitis C virus infections [Whitaker et al., 1974; Kahane et al., 1981; Kazatchkine et al., 1984; Mayer and Beardsley, 1996; Neau et al., 1997; Rand and Wright, 1998; Scheurlen et al., 2001; Sainokami et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2005; Panzer et al., 2006; Passos et al., 2010]. Autoantibodies have been identified in several viral infections. The target is usually one of the surface glycoproteins such as GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb/IX, or GPV, with a possible cross reactivity between antibodies against the virus and the platelets [Mayer and Beardsley, 1996; Tanaka et al., 2003], as in HIV where platelets are bound via the platelet glycoprotein IIIa integrin [Passos et al., 2010]. Whether platelet destruction in viral hepatitis is caused by platelet\u2010specific glycoprotein antibodies, by immune complexes bound to the platelet surface or by a combination of the above, remains uncertain [Doi et al., 2002; Weksler, 2007]. In secondary dengue virus infection, platelet apoptosis seems to be enhanced, which results in increased platelet clearance [Alonzo et al., 2012]. This is probably present in any viral infection that leads to a systemic inflammatory response. Platelets may serve as carriers of viral infections, which are then damaged and partially destroyed [Terada et al., 1966]. Platelet consumption due to other mechanisms has been documented for influenza, SARS, hantavirus, and adenovirus infections [Lee, 1987; Rand and Wright, 1998; Yang et al., 2005; Othman et al., 2007]. Hantavirus\u2010infected endothelial cells seem to bind to quiescent platelets via an Alpha\u2010v beta\u20103 integrin dependent mechanism, which is the cellular receptor for the hantavirus [Gavrilovskaya et al., 2002, 2010]. This may not only result in a decreased number of platelets; that is, thrombocytopenia, but also a decreased function and an increased vascular permeability. Furthermore, in hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome patients in China, the intensity of this receptor, also known as CD61\u2014determined by flow cytometry\u2014on platelets correlates with the severity of the disease [Liu et al., 2008].",

            "text": "Platelets derived from patients infected with Lassa fever had depressed capacities for platelet aggregation [Cummins et al., 1989; Roberts et al., 1989; Richmond and Baglole, 2003]. Acute\u2010phase plasma from Lassa fever patients showed inhibition of ADP\u2010induced platelet aggregation. This inhibition was found in 80% of Lassa fever patients with hemorrhage but in only 16% of those without hemorrhage. When plasma samples from Lassa fever patients were mixed 1:1 with control, platelet\u2010rich plasma, a marked inhibition of ADP\u2010induced aggregation was observed. These findings indicate that platelet dysfunction may play an important role in the bleeding characteristics of this disease [Cummins et al., 1989; Roberts et al., 1989]. However a decreased fibrinogen concentration may also play a role explaining this phenomenon. Furthermore, influenza, rhinovirus and other viruses stimulate IL\u20106 production [Bouwman et al., 2002]. There is a complex platelet\u2013endothelial\u2013leukocyte interplay [Othman et al., 2007]. Viruses bind to platelets, which are then activated, leading to rapid exposure of P\u2010selectin on the platelet surface, which, in turn, triggers the formation of platelet\u2013leukocyte aggregates. Subsequently, endothelial cells are activated, which is demonstrated by increases in vascular cell adhesion of molecule 1, von Willebrand factor and endothelial cell\u2010derived microparticles. A reduced production of platelets was observed in SARS, HCV, HIV, hantavirus, and Junin hemorrhagic fever infections. This can be caused by the direct infection of hemapoietic stem/progenitor cells and megakaryocytes [Carballal et al., 1981; Li et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2005; Lutteke et al., 2010; Passos et al., 2010]. For example, pathogenic hantaviruses invade and subsequently replicate in megakaryocytes, leading to upregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class 1 molecules, the target structures of cytotoxic CD8 T\u2010cells in vitro. These T\u2010cells kill the infected megakaryocyte, hypothetically leading to a decreased platelet production. This could also explain why corticosteroid treatment increases platelet count by inhibiting the cellular immune response in hantavirus\u2010infected patients [Dunst et al., 1998; Seitsonen et al., 2006]. In addition to this, impaired thrombopoietin production, the primary cytokine governing megakaryocyte maturation and platelet formation [Kaushansky, 1998], is present in HCV if there is hepatocellular damage [Weksler, 2007]. Reduced platelet production is not always caused by the infection itself but sometimes by the medical therapy. Well\u2010known examples are the pegylated interferon (peg\u2010IFN) treatment of HCV and antiretroviral therapy for HIV [Kowdley, 2005; Passos et al., 2010]. Finally, hypersplenism (with the sequestration of platelets) due to portal hypertension can be present in chronic hepatitis [Weksler, 2007].",

The presence of elevated levels of factor VIII is a risk factor found in chronic HBV and HCV patients [Papatheodoridis et al., 2003]. Laboratory studies have shown that herpes viruses can facilitate factor Xa generation from the inactive precursor factor X, but only when factor VII/VIIa and calcium ions are present [Sutherland et al., 1997]. Raised coagulation markers have also been found in animal and human tissue. Increased numbers of intravascular thrombi and fibrin deposition in lungs were found in cases of influenza, avian influenza, and SARS infection, and these may well be the result of disseminated intravascular coagulation and microthrombosis [Hwang et al., 2005; Keller et al., 2006; Muramoto et al., 2006]. In SARS infections, pulmonary infarcts were observed [Hwang et al., 2005]. Fibrin depositions were also found in tissue from primates infected with the Ebola virus [Geisbert et al., 2003a, b]. In contrast to the activated coagulation system described above, activities of factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, and X and factor XII were decreased in dengue while in hantavirus infections factors II, V, VIII, IX, and X seemed to be decreased [Lee, 1987]. However, results in dengue research are inconclusive [Mairuhu et al., 2003]. Decreased levels of these coagulation factors are associated with hemorrhage and might be due to the consumption or loss of these factors. During the convalescent phase of DHF, factor VIII levels and factor VIIa levels were increased, when compared to dengue fever (DF) [Sosothikul et al., 2007]. Elevated levels of factor XIa\u2010C1\u2010inhibitor complexes were found in patients with DHF, indicating the activation of coagulation [van Gorp et al., 2001]. Macaques infected with the Ebola virus showed decreased levels of factor VIIa [Geisbert et al., 2003b].",

The activation of the coagulation system results in elevated levels of several systemic coagulation markers. Increased levels of D\u2010dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, thrombin\u2013antithrombin complexes, and/or plasmin\u2013alpha\u20102\u2010antiplasmin complexes have been found in respiratory tract infections, influenza, SARS, HIV, HCV, VZV, and the hanta\u2010, Ebola\u2010, and dengue\u2010hemorrhagic viruses [Bray et al., 2001; Canpolat and Bakir, 2002; Crum\u2010Cianflone et al., 2008; Feffer et al., 1995; Geisbert et al., 2003a, b; Keller et al., 2006, 2007; Kurugol et al., 2000; Laine et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2003; Mairuhu et al., 2003; Schouten et al., 2010; van Gorp et al., 2001; Violi et al., 1995; Wu et al., 2003]. Patients with HCV infection had levels of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 that were elevated significantly [Violi et al., 1995]. Increased thrombin\u2013antithrombin to plasmin\u2013alpha\u20102\u2010antiplasmin ratios, indicating a balance shifted to a procoagulant state, were found in dengue patients and associated with an adverse clinical outcome [van Gorp et al., 2002]. Fatal cases of Ebola infection showed higher levels of d\u2010dimer and fibrin degradation products during the acute phase of the disease [Bray et al., 2001; Rollin et al., 2007]. The level of these coagulation products correlate with death, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may therefore be an early and important component of Ebola infection [Bray et al., 2001; Rollin et al., 2007].",

However, several issues about the relationship between viral infections and the coagulation system remain unknown. For example, there are gaps in the knowledge of the effect that viral hemorrhagic fevers have on coagulation markers; most data come from studies on dengue virus infections. Furthermore, limited data exists on the duration of a procoagulant state during or after viral infections. For example, the elevated levels of procoagulant proteins in viral respiratory tract infections returned to baseline after two weeks [Keller et al., 2007]. In a study of children with dengue shock syndrome (DSS), fibrinogen levels decreased significantly two days after hospital admission and had returned to normal within a month [Wills et al., 2002].",

            "text": "Several viral infections lead to deficiencies in the natural anticoagulants protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and heparin cofactor II. It is well known that these deficiencies are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Such deficiencies have been reported in respiratory tract infections in general, VZV, HIV, HBV, HCV, hantavirus, DSS, and Ebola virus infections [Bissuel et al., 1992; Canpolat and Bakir, 2002; Crum\u2010Cianflone et al., 2008; Erbe et al., 2003; Geisbert et al., 2003b; Kaba et al., 2003; Kurugol et al., 2000; Laine et al., 2010; Papatheodoridis et al., 2003; Wills et al., 2002]. Probable deficiency mechanisms include autoantibodies against protein C, protein S and antithrombin, as described in VZV infections [Josephson et al., 2001; van Ommen et al., 2002], as well as the leakage of these proteins through the endothelium of capillaries, such as in dengue shock [Wills et al., 2002], and the consumption of these natural anticoagulants [Esmon, 2004; Sosothikul et al., 2007; Laine et al., 2010]. Another underlying mechanism could be the decreased synthesis of clotting factors by the liver. In chronic viral hepatitis the degree of antithrombin and protein C deficiency was found to be strongly associated with advanced fibrosis of the liver [Papatheodoridis et al., 2003]. An increased (local) production of thrombomodulin may have an anticoagulant effect [Dahlback, 2005]. Thrombomodulin expression is increased on the surface of sinusoidal endothelial cells in both chronic hepatitis B and C patients [Zeniya et al., 1995]. Soluble thrombomodulin levels were also increased in patients with SARS and severe dengue infection [Wills et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2005; Sosothikul et al., 2007]. Furthermore, dengue virus promotes the expression of thrombomodulin in cultured endothelial cells [Jiang et al., 2007]. Circulating soluble thrombomodulin may reflect endothelial cell activation, however thrombomodulin is most active when it is bound to endothelium [Schouten et al., 2008].",

            "text": "Impaired fibrinolysis (or a hypofibrinolytic state), and thus an elevated risk of thrombosis, has been reported in several viral infections. There are two mechanisms to consider here. Firstly, increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor\u20101 have been found in influenza, SARS, VZV, CMV, dengue, and HIV infections [Woodroffe and Kuan, 1998; Kurugol et al., 2000; Koppel et al., 2002; Wills et al., 2002; Klein et al., 2005; Keller et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006; Sosothikul et al., 2007; Schouten et al., 2010]. In HIV infection, elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor\u20101 levels have been shown to be related to the metabolic syndrome and the use of protease inhibitors as part of the antiretroviral therapy [Koppel et al., 2002]. Secondly, plasminogen deficiency is present in patients with chronic viral hepatitis [Papatheodoridis et al., 2003]. Dengue virus infection is associated with a hyperfibrinolytic state due to an increase in the levels and activity of tissue\u2010plasminogen activator, which results in an increased breakdown of fibrin strands, and thus an elevated risk of hemorrhage. However, increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor\u20101 have also been found in dengue virus infections and these correlate with disease severity [Huang et al., 2001; van Gorp et al., 2001, 2002; Wills et al., 2002; Mairuhu et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2007; Sosothikul et al., 2007]. In hantavirus infections, enhanced fibrinolysis could compensate for the increased coagulation activity and contribute to clinical recovery, but this does not explain the bleeding complications seen in hantavirus cases [Laine et al., 2010]. In addition to this, increased plasma concentrations of tissue\u2010plasminogen activator and soluble thrombomodulin were found in SARS infections [Liu et al., 2005]. However assays quantifying tissue\u2010plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor\u20101 used to measure both the circulating proteins as the protein complexes. Which makes it hard to identify actual plasma levels. In patients infected with Crimean\u2010Congo hemorrhagic fever and dengue virus, thrombin\u2010activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity was decreased, which may have contributed to an imbalance in fibrinolysis [Mairuhu et al., 2003; Sonmez et al., 2007; Sosothikul et al., 2007]. The decreased thrombin\u2010activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity may have been due to liver dysfunction during the infection [Sonmez et al., 2007], but it may also suggest the consumption of this inhibitor by excessive thrombin formation [Mairuhu et al., 2003].",

            "text": "The relationship between antiphospholipid antibodies, thrombosis and infection is not fully clear. Antibodies against phospholipids during acute infection are a diverse group of autoantibodies against proteins bound to phospholipids. They only remain in the plasma for a short period and most of them are not related to clinical thrombosis [de Groot and Urbanus, 2012]. However the Antiphospholipid antibodies, directed against the plasma protein \u03b22\u2010glycoprotein I, are associated with arterial or venous thrombosis and pregnancy complications [Ruiz\u2010Irastorza et al., 2002; Asherson et al., 2008; Espinosa et al., 2008]. Antiphospholipid antibodies have been associated with infections of parvovirus B19, several herpes viruses, such as CMV, EBV and VZV, HAV, HBV, HCV, and HIV [Yamazaki et al., 1991; Prieto et al., 1996; Violi et al., 1997; Kurugol et al., 2000; 2001; Ertem et al., 2001; Uthman and Gharavi, 2002; Youd et al., 2003; Yuste and Prieto, 2003; Cervera and Asherson, 2005; van Hal et al., 2005; Crum\u2010Cianflone et al., 2008; Sene et al., 2008]. Antiphospholipid antibodies that are frequently found in patients with chronic HCV infection have not only been implicated in HCV\u2010associated thrombosis, but also in thrombocytopenia [Prieto et al., 1996]. It has been suggested that antiphospholipid antibodies might participate in the process of fibrosis by promoting thrombosis in small intrahepatic vessels. Whether these antibodies contribute to clinically important thrombotic events during infection remains controversial [Prieto et al., 1996; Mangia et al., 1999; Harada et al., 2000; Josephson et al., 2001; Cervera and Asherson, 2005; Sene et al., 2008]. Gharavi et al. [2002] have shown that immunization with peptides derived from cytomegalovirus induced lupus anticoagulant activity and resulted in thrombotic complications. While the presence of anti\u2010\u03b22GPI antibodies has been reported in CMV patients presenting with thrombosis [Delbos et al., 2007; de Groot and Urbanus, 2012].",

It is not clear, for example, why some viruses have a strong influence on coagulation and are associated with thrombotic complications or bleeding, while in other viral infections this effect is limited. The complex interplay between the host, the virus (virulence), the vector and the environment (infection pressure in the community) defines the clinical presentation and outcome. This might explain the divergent clinical presentations of viral infections in different parts of the world. Furthermore, differences in clinical presentation could also be explained by the diverse tropism of viruses, such as for monocytes or endothelial cells for example. It is not always clear whether a virus exerts its effect through the direct infection of the target cell, through virus\u2010specific antibodies, or via inflammatory mediators. In addition to this, inherited host factors also play a role in disease severity.",

            "text": "For implementing specific therapeutic interventions, it is crucial to know how the hemostatic balance of an individual is affected during the course of the infection. This is extremely difficult to determine, particularly in acute infections, and this is the main reason that theoretically promising interventions (anti\u2010TNF, activated protein C) were less successful, disappointing even, in clinical practice. Coagulation disorders vary among the viral hemorrhagic fevers. Both coagulation and fibrinolysis are activated, but the degree of activation of the coagulation system is influenced by the ability of the host to effectively balance the counteracting effects [Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004]. It is quite possible that there are major similarities in mechanisms in which different viral infections interact with the coagulation pathway. Even though studies on the interaction of several viral infections with coagulation have been performed with different methods, and these were focused on various elements of the coagulation system, it now seems evident that these viruses interact with coagulation both in a common way as with specific features related to the specific virus. Furthermore, more research on the alteration of coagulation has been performed on some viruses, such as CMV for example, than on others. It is conceivable that other, less prevalent, viral infections exert the same effect on the coagulation cascade, but studies are lacking. In the case of filoviruses, little research has been performed, partly because of the hazards and logistical difficulties associated with collecting and processing blood samples in the remote regions of Africa where outbreaks usually occur. Furthermore, most data come from in vitro studies, which may not accurately reflect the situation in actual infections in humans. In vivo data are also not clear [Squizzato et al., 2005]. For example, Ebola infections have been induced in non\u2010human primates, although useful to determine pathophysiological mechanisms these cannot be considered representative of human infections because the disease in monkeys appears to develop more rapidly and takes a more severe clinical course [Rollin et al., 2007]. For some other viruses there are not yet any adequate animal models. The effect of viral infections on coagulation, and the resulting clinical picture, could be exacerbated by other factors, such as thrombophilia as a host factor for example, and the environment (i.e., infection pressure). Several studies have shown that in patients with thrombotic complications during CMV infection, additional thrombophilic factors were present, such as the factor V Leiden mutation or the prothrombin G20210A mutation [Fridlender et al., 2007; Lijfering et al., 2007]. It is possible that those patients would not have developed thrombosis without the co\u2010existing thrombophilia. In the case of respiratory viruses, seasonal variation in several hemostatic proteins may contribute to a more pronounced effect on coagulation and therefore the development of thrombosis. It has been documented that during winter, platelet count, fibrinogen, factor VII, and plasminogen activator inhibitor\u20101 are elevated [Woodhouse et al., 1994; Frohlich et al., 1997; Crawford et al., 2003]. Naturally occurring seasonal variations may exist independently of viral infections. Because respiratory viruses are more common during winter, it has been suggested that the combination of a seasonal variation and a viral infection has a more pronounced effect on the coagulation system, resulting in a higher risk of thrombosis. It was found that the risk of thrombosis is elevated during the first two weeks of a respiratory tract infection [Smeeth et al., 2006]. Bleeding may result from a multifactorial process resulting from a combination of thrombocytopenia due to autoantibodies or the consumption of platelets, the consumption of clotting factors (local), fibrinolysis, and vascular damage or leakage. For most hemorrhagic viruses, infection leads to increased anticoagulant activity and hyperfibrinolysis, partly by activated endothelial cells. For example, data on dengue virus infections showed increased endothelial cell damage [Sosothikul et al., 2007], but there is confliction in the data [Martina et al., 2009].",

            "text": "Despite increasing data on the association of viral infections and the coagulation cascade, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind this association have not yet been elucidated fully for most viruses. Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms leading to thrombosis or bleeding is fundamental for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Given the potential role that tissue factor may play in some of the thrombohemorrhagic complications of viral disease, therapeutic intervention at the tissue factor level, for example, or aimed at one of the critical cytokines that mediate its cellular expression, may alter the clinical course of these infections favourably. For example, in patients infected with dengue, pharmacological agents that block tissue factor may represent an important therapeutic approach [Huerta\u2010Zepeda et al., 2008]. In a study in rhesus monkeys infected with the Ebola virus, treatment with a recombinant inhibitor of factor VIIa/tissue factor showed a prolonged survival time and attenuation of the coagulation and proinflammatory response [Geisbert et al., 2003a]. In another study in rhesus monkeys infected with the Ebola virus, treatment with a recombinant human activated protein C improved the chances of survival significantly [Hensley et al., 2007]. Therapy reduced coagulopathy and decreased inflammation and viral replication. These examples indicate that therapeutic strategies targeted at the coagulation cascade seem promising. However, none of them are ready for phase 2 trials. Because many issues remain unanswered, there is an urgent need for more clinical and experimental studies. Furthermore, additional studies are needed to investigate further in several areas. These include the efficacy of prophylactic LMWH, the need to test for viral pathogens in patients with thrombosis in irregular places (such as the portal vein), prothrombotic intervention in patients with hemorrhagic viral infection and the proper treatment of patients with viral DIC. In summary, during the past decade the world has been confronted with outbreaks of old and new viral infections. These have often been accompanied by the activation of coagulation at different levels of the coagulation cascade, resulting in venous thrombosis, DIC with microvascular thrombosis and bleeding. Although direct interaction between the virus and the coagulation system occurs, coagulation activation is also indirectly influenced by cytokines. An imbalance of the coagulation cascade may be the result, either procoagulant or profibrinolytic. Generally speaking, chronic viral infections seem to be associated with thrombotic complications, while acute viral infections are associated with either thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. However, therapeutic antiviral options are still limited and vaccines are often not available, which makes supportive treatment crucial in the clinical management of these often life\u2010threatening infections. Although evidence is still limited, patients with unexplained thrombosis in places other than in the extremities or the lungs (the portal vein, for example), as described in HAV, HCV, and CMV infections (see Table I), should be tested for those viral pathogens. Furthermore, because there is a strong association between several viral infections and antiphospholipid antibodies, as was discussed above, patients with newly found antiphospholipid antibodies should also be screened for viral pathogens, taking into account the local epidemiology and travel history. In patients admitted to hospital with severe viral infection, thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular\u2010weight heparin should be started, unless there is an increased risk of bleeding. Furthermore, patients who are bedbound but not admitted to hospital should also be considered for treatment with low molecular\u2010weight heparin. In mild thrombocytopenia (with a platelet count >50 \u00d7 109/L) low molecular\u2010weight heparin is not contraindicated. Insufficient studies have been made in this field to support the recommendation. The guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians, ACCP, can be consulted [Geerts et al., 2008; Eikelboom et al., 2012]. Patients with bleeding complications, with or without systemic inflammatory response syndrome, or sepsis due to viral infection, should receive prompt standard supportive care (such as fluid resuscitation or ventilatory support, for example), as stated in the treatment guidelines for severe sepsis or septic shock [Dellinger et al., 2008].",

Studies to investigate the value of these therapeutic agents are required, especially in dengue virus infections, given that this is the most prevalent virus causing hemorrhagic fever. Therapeutic intervention of the tissue factor pathway seems promising, but supporting evidence is still limited and not yet near large human tirals.
