The resident also joined nurse practitioner supervision. Throughout the rotation the resident met with the geriatric psychiatry chief resident on a weekly basis to discuss cases and to work on a deprescribing/medication reconciliation assignment to minimize polypharmacy.",

The second will be to record didactics, as this may allow future residents to view lectures in advance and use didactic time for one-on-one learning and discussion. We will continue the deprescribing assignment and final presentation, unstructured time for self-directed learning, and resident participation in virtual clinical visits and collaborative care.",

With our first resident experience in a virtual outpatient geriatric psychiatry rotation, we have learned that this model is not only feasible, but of high educational value. Whether the resident (and supervisor) are learning about telephonic/video cognitive screening, anxiety as a response to a new and devastating virus, or thinking through creative ways to incorporate physical activity and social connectedness during a time of social distancing, preliminary feedback has been very positive. A virtual geriatric psychiatry rotation can indeed teach not only the basics of geriatric psychiatry, but it may also increase resident comfort with the management of complicated older adults who are unable to be seen in person.",
