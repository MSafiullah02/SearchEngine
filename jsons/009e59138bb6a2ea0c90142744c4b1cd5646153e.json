Serology (also known as antibody) testing represents an opportunity to systematically monitor the spread of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify disproportionately affected populations, and study protective immunity. M any policymakers, public health officials and employers are contemplating the role of serosurveillance in strategies to reopen society. 1 Several countries and organizations -including the World Health Organization, with its Solidarity II program -have begun ramping up serological testing efforts. 2, 3 However, limitations in serological study designs and test standards raise concerns about the validity of seroprevalence estimates and their utility in decision-making. Shortfalls in the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid diagnostic testing (including poor test sensitivity and specificity, lack of distribution at scale, and inconsistent testing protocols), and the associated public outcry, serve as a cautionary tale for efforts to implement antibody-based screening. 4 There is now a critical window of opportunity to learn from early SARS-CoV-2 serology studies. This paper presents results from a rapid up-to-date systematic review and synthesis of the results of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance projects from around the world and provides recommendations to improve the coordination, strategy, and methodology of future serosurveillance efforts.",

Moderate: Moderate certainty in the prevalence: the true prevalence is likely to be close to the estimate, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.

Overall, 14 countries have reported estimates from completed or ongoing studies, with six additional countries having proposed studies (Figure 2 ). Various stakeholders have taken the lead on these studies, including federal and regional governments, universities, health systems, businesses, and cooperative efforts (Table 4 ).

For example, the US FDA's Emergency Use Authorization Pathway for serological tests requires the submission of test results on only 30 positive and 80 negative sera, and considers cross-reactivity against HIV but not other coronaviruses. 7 Meanwhile, a variety of groups have conducted independent evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests utilizing different volumes and types of sera in their reference panels. [13] [14] [15] Investigators from UCSF included SARS-CoV-2 positive sera at multiple time points from infection and negative sera as part of the test evaluation for their study, 13 while Danish study investigators included robust assessment of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and respiratory viruses. 14 FINDDx is leading an ongoing independent evaluation program of 27 rapid diagnostic tests and seven ELISAs. Their evaluation should be commended for using large samples (100 positive and 100-300 negative sera) at multiple time points from symptom onset, but does not not appear to mandate cross-reactivity testing to ensure test specificity. 15 Sensitivity and specificity thresholds for serology tests are a function of the prevalence of infection. As many have pointed out for initial seroprevalence results, 90% specificity may seem high, but can lead to as many false positives as true positives if prevalence is low. Insofar as evidence of infection correlates with decreased risk of re-infection -a variable of interest to guide decisions on re-opening society -there is a need to minimize false positives. As a result, the specificity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests has moved towards 99%.",
