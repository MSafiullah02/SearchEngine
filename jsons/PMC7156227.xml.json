            "text": "The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported on December 30, 2019, in Wuhan city, Hubei province, P.R. China [1]. Swift actions were taken by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Chinese health authorities, and researchers. The World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named this pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [2]. On January 10, 2020, the first whole-genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was released, which helped researchers to quickly identify the virus in patients using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods [3]. On January 21, the first article related to 2019-nCoV was published, which revealed that 2019-nCoV belongs to the beta-coronavirus group, sharing ancestry with bat coronavirus HKU9-1, similar to SARS-coronaviruses, and despite sequence diversity its spike protein interacts strongly with the human ACE2 receptor [1]. On January 30, the WHO announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Later, the human-to-human transmission was confirmed. As of January 31, 51 whole-genome sequences of 2019-nCoV from different laboratories and regions have been submitted to GISAID database [4]. On the February 12th, the WHO permanently named the 2019-nCoV pathogen as SARS-CoV-2 and the causing disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019). Chinese government swift actions helped them to control COVID-19 in China. However, SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread to over 150 countries. On March 11th, WHO formally recognized the COVID-19 as a pandemic. By March 19th, 2020, the global death toll reached to 9,913, with 2,42,650 laboratory-confirmed cases. The case fatality rate among infected people is varying in different countries. However, global case fatality rate is presently around 3.92% (calculated as deaths/[deaths + laboratory confirmed cases]).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that possess large viral RNA genomes [5]. Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar genomic organization to other beta-coronaviruses, consisting of a 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), a replicase complex (orf1ab) encoding non-structural proteins (nsps), a spike protein (S) gene, envelope protein (E) gene, a membrane protein (M) gene, a nucleocapsid protein (N) gene, 3\u2032-UTR, and several unidentified non-structural open reading frames [3]. Although SARS-CoV-2 is classified into the beta-coronaviruses group, it is diverse from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Recent studies highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 genes share <80% nucleotide identity and 89.10% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV genes [6,7]. Usually, beta-coronaviruses produce a \u223c800 kDa polypeptide upon transcription of the genome. This polypeptide is proteolytically cleaved to generate various proteins. The proteolytic processing is mediated by papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). The 3CLpro cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites to generate various non-structural proteins that are important for viral replication [8]. 3CLpro play a critical role in the replication of virus particles and unlike structural/accessory protein-encoding genes, it is located at the 3\u2032 end which exhibits excessive variability. Therefore, it is a potential target for anti-coronaviruses inhibitors screening [9]. Structure-based activity analyses and high-throughput studies have identified potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CLpro [[10], [11], [12]]. Medicinal plants, especially those employed in traditional Chinese medicine, have attracted significant attention because they include bioactive compounds that could be used to develop formal drugs against several diseases with no or minimal side-effects [13]. Therefore, the present study was conducted to obtain structural insight into the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and to discover potent anti-COVID-19 natural compounds.",

The results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro clustered with bat SARS-like coronaviruses and sharing 99.02% sequence identity (Fig. 1\nA).

Analysis of physicochemical parameters revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro polypeptide is 306 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 33,796.64 Da and a GRAVY score of \u22120.019, categorising the protein as a stable, hydrophilic molecule capable of establishing hydrogen bonds (Table 1\n).",

There were 12-point mutations (Val35Thr, Ser46Ala, Asn65Ser, Val86Leu, Lys88Arg, Ala94Ser, Phe134His, Asn180Lys, Val202Leu, Ser267Ala, Ser284Ala and Leu286Ala) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro enzymes (Fig. S1). Except for replacement of Leu with Ala at position 286, all other replacements conserve polarity and hydrophobicity. However, these mutations may affect 3CLpro structure and function. Therefore, the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was predicted. Firstly, a single chain monomeric model comprising all domains (Domain I = residues 8\u2013100; Domain II = residues 101\u2013183; Domain III = residues 200\u2013303) was built (Fig. S2). N-terminal amino acids 1 to 7 form the N-finger that plays a significant role in dimerization and formation of the active site of 3CLpro. Domains I and II, collectively referred to as the N-terminal domain, includes an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure with 13 \u03b2-strands. The binding site for the substrate is situated in a cleft between domains I and II. A loop from residues 184 to 199 joins the N-terminal domain and Domain III, which is also called the C-terminal domain and comprises an anti-parallel cluster of five \u03b1-helices. The overall molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was in consistent with the crystal structure of SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 3M3V); the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the homology model and the template was 0.629 \u00c5. Structural and Ramachandran plot analyses revealed that 99% of residues are in favourable regions.",

Further, mutational analyses depicted none of the mutations affected the overall structure of SARS-CoV-2, which fully superimposed on the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (Fig. 1D). The results also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41), consistent with SARS 3CLpro (Cys-145 and His-41), TGEV 3CLpro (Cys-144 and His-41) and HCoV 3CLpro (Cys-144 and His-41) [34].

We also docked ML188 with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure (PDB ID: 3M3V) as a reference, and ML188 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The inhibitor targets the Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S = \u221212.27) was relatively high. However, surprisingly, ML188 did not show significant binding to the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2, and the docking score (S = \u22128.31) was considerably lower (Fig. S3).

We developed a library from our previously published studies that contains numerous natural compounds possessing potential anti-viral activities and screened it against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro homology model. Recent drug repurposing studies proposed few drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and suggested that they could be used to treat COVID-19. Herein, we selected the best of these (Nelfinavir, Prulifloxacin and Colistin) from three different drug repurposing studies [36,37] and docked them as controls in the present study (Fig. S4). Our analyses identified nine novel non-toxic, druggable natural compounds that are predicted to bind with the receptor binding site and catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (Table 2\n; Fig. S5). ADMET profiling of the selected hits is given in Table S2. Among these screened phytochemicals, 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-2\u2019-(3,3-dimethylallyl) isoflavone, is an isoflavone extracted from Psorothamnus arborescens [38], that exhibited the highest binding affinity (\u221229.57 kcal/mol) and docking score (S = \u221216.35), and formed strong hydrogen bonds with the catalytic dyad residues (Cys-145 and His-41) as well as significant interactions with the receptor-binding residues Thr24, Thr25, Thr26, Cys44, Thr45, Ser46, Met49, Asn142, Gly143, His164, Glu166 and Gln189 (Fig. 1E). A literature review revealed that 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-2\u2019-(3,3-dimethylallyl) isoflavone has been successfully used as an anti-leishmanial agent [38], and it is also found in traditional Chinese medicine records [39]. Our screened phytochemicals displayed higher docking scores, stronger binding energies, and more closer interactions with the conserved catalytic dyad residues (Cys-145 and His-41) than Nelfinavir, Prulifloxacin and Colistin. These results suggested that natural products identified in our study may prove more useful candidates for COVID-19 drug therapy.",

The root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (RoG) and hydrogen bond parameters were calculated. RMSD is an indicator of the stability of ligand-protein complexes. None of the complex showed any obvious fluctuations, and all three were stable, with average RMSD values of 1.6 \u00b1 0.02 \u00c5, 1.5 \u00b1 0.02 \u00c5 and 1.7 \u00b1 0.02 \u00c5 for 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-2\u2019-(3,3-dimethylallyl) isoflavone, myricitrin, and methyl rosmarinate, respectively (Fig. 2\nA). RMSF is an indicator of residual flexibility. Minimal fluctuations were observed for myricitrin and methyl rosmarinate, and the overall complexes remained stable throughout the simulations. The functionally important catalytic dyad residues (Cys-145 and His-41) displayed stable behaviour, and fluctuations were observed toward the C-terminal end of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro molecule (Fig. 2B). RoG is an indicator of protein compactness, stability, and folding, and the results suggested normal behaviour for all three complexes; all remained compact and stable throughout the 50 ns simulations (Fig. 2C). In addition, hydrogen bonds, which are the main stabilising interactions factors in proteins, suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro internal hydrogen bonds remain stable throughout the simulation, with no obvious fluctuations (Fig. 2D). These results confirmed our findings, and further indicated that these compounds may serve as potential anti-COVID-19 drug sources.",

Despite significant overall similarity with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure, the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro substrate binding site had some key differences, which highlighted the need for rapid drug discovery to address the alarming COVID-19 pandemic. Medicinal plant compounds are already used to successfully treat numerous viral diseases. Herein, we screened a medicinal plant database containing 32,297 potential anti-viral phytochemicals and selected the top nine hits that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity and hence virus replication.

Chain-A (protomer-A) is in multicolour and Chain-B (protomer-B) is in dark blue. The N-finger that plays an important role in dimerization maintaining the active conformation is shown in hot pink, domain I is coloured cyan, domain II is shown in green, and domain III is coloured yellow. The N- and C-termini are labelled. Residues of the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) are highlighted in yellow and labelled. (D) Cartoon representation of the 3CLpro monomer model (chain/protomer-A) of SARS-CoV-2 superimposed with the SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure. The SARS-CoV 3CLpro template is coloured cyan, the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro structure is coloured grey, and all identified mutations are highlighted in red. (E) Docking of 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-2'-(3,3-dimethylallyl) isoflavone inside the receptor-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, showing hydrogen bonds with the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41). The 3CLpro structure is coloured dark blue, the 5,7,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-2'-(3,3-dimethylallyl) isoflavone is orange, and hydrogen coloured maroon.
