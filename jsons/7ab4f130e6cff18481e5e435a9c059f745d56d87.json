            "text": "We introduce GACELA, a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed to restore missing musical audio data with a duration ranging between hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds, i.e., to perform long-gap audio inpainting. While previous work either addressed shorter gaps or relied on exemplars by copying available information from other signal parts, GACELA addresses the inpainting of long gaps in two aspects. First, it considers various time scales of audio information by relying on five parallel discriminators with increasing resolution of receptive fields. Second, it is conditioned not only on the available information surrounding the gap, i.e., the context, but also on the latent variable of the conditional GAN. This addresses the inherent multi-modality of audio inpainting at such long gaps and provides the option of user-defined inpainting. GACELA was tested in listening tests on music signals of varying complexity and gap durations ranging from 375 ms to 1500 ms. While our subjects were often able to detect the inpaintings, the severity of the artifacts decreased from unacceptable to mildly disturbing. GACELA represents a framework capable to integrate future improvements such as processing of more auditory-related features or more explicit musical features.",

            "text": "Audio signals frequently suffer from undesired localized corruptions. These corruptions can be a product of issues during the recording, packet-loss in transmission, or a faulty storage such as a scratched vinyl record. Although the corruptions may have different roots, the study of their removal can be unified as the restoration of localized lost information, usually called audio inpainting [1] . This restoration has also been referred to in the literature as audio interpolation and extrapolation [2, 3] , or waveform substitution [4] . For short corruptions affecting less than a few tens of milliseconds, the goal of audio inpainting algorithms has been to recover the lost information exactly [5] . But as the corruptions affect longer periods of time, that goal becomes unrealistic. For long corruptions, audio inpainting algorithms attempt to reduce the damage by preventing audible artifacts and introducing new coherent information. The new information needs to be semantically compatible, a challenging task for for music, which often has a strict underlying structure with long dependencies. Previous work [6] tried to exploit this structure by repurposing information already available in the signal instead of generating new information. This approach has obivous downsides as it expects music to have repetitions and it usually modifies the length of the corruption. Others [7] have proposed methods that do generate new information, but aim at exact reconstruction and therefore fail to generalize for corruptions over tens of milliseconds.",

In particular, we study the algorithm for the reconstruction of musical signals, i.e., a mix of sounds from musical instruments organized in time. Further, we assume that areas of lost information are separated in time, such that the local information surrounding the gap, the context, is reliable and can be exploited. The proposed algorithm relies on a generative adversarial network (GAN) [8] conditioned on the encoded context information. We refer to the algorithm as a context encoder following [9, 7] . Our context encoder aims at generating content that matches the sound characteristics and respects the semantic cohesion of the available bordering information. In this contribution, we explain our design choices and we provide a thorough evaluation of our context encoder to determine factors with the largest potential for future improvement.

We refer to this as inpainting of short gaps. On the other hand, gaps on a scale of hundreds of milliseconds or even seconds may happen, e.g., when reading partially damaged physical media, in live music recordings, when unwanted noise originating from the audience needs to be removed, or in audio transmission with a total loss of the connection between transmitter and receiver lasting for seconds.

As discussed in [5] , such methods do not extend well to longer gaps, see also [16] for a recent study of sparsity-based audio inpainting. Other methods for short gap inpainting and relying on TF representations rely, e.g., on a regression model [17] , or nonnegative matrix and tensor factorization [18, 19, 20] . More recently, a powerful framework has been proposed for various audio inverse problems [21] including time-domain audio inpainting, source separation [22] , and declipping [23] even in a multichannel scenario [24] .",

The context encoder presented in [7, 28] is specifically targeted to medium duration gaps. The pre-print [36] seems to be the first to evaluate the inpainting of slightly longer gaps (100 to 400 ms) with neural networks, comparing several models originally proposed for general conditioned audio synthesis with the graph-based method [6] , as well as the authors' own proposal for a deep neural system for audio inpainting. Generally speaking, deep audio inpainting seems to be a particularly tough instance of conditioned deep neural audio synthesis, since the conditioning only contains indirect information about the content to be generated, which nonetheless needs to be seamlessly inserted into the existing reliable audio.",

            "text": "There have been many attempts to synthesize audio using neural networks. However, neural audio synthesis remains a particularly challenging task because of the presence of complex structures with dependencies on various temporal scales. Neural audio synthesizers are often conditioned to reduce the dependencies on larger temporal scales [37, 38] , but even then the networks that finally synthesize the signal are fairly sophisticated [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44] . This can be partially explained by these networks modeling audio as a time representation with a high temporal resolution; audio time signals usually have at least 16,000 samples per second. In contrast, when modeling audio as a time-frequency (TF) representation, the temporal resolution is a parameter of the model. In fact, TF representations of audio are widely applied to neural networks, e.g., for solving discriminative tasks, in which they outperform networks directly trained on the waveform [45, 46, 47] . TF representations are also commonly chosen to condition neural synthesizers [48, 49] , e.g., Tacotron 2 [50] relies on noninvertible mel-frequency spectrograms and Timbretron [51] relies on the constant-Q transform. In those cases, the gen-eration of a time-domain signal from the TF coefficients is then achieved by training a conditional neural synthesizer to act as a vocoder. Despite recent improvements in neural synthesizers modeling audio in the TF domain [52, 53, 54] , the state-of-the-art neural synthesizers still model audio in the time domain.",

Modeling music has proven particularly difficult due to a wide range of timescales in dependencies from pitch and timbre (short-term), through rhythm (medium-term) to song structure (long-term) [55, 38] . The long-range dependencies can be addressed by synthesizing music in multiple steps. Different features have been proposed as intermediate representations [56, 57, 58] , with a common symbolic one being MIDI [59, 55, 60] . Conditioning neural synthesizers with neurally generated MIDI has many advantages: 1) it is analogous to the discrete structure embedded in music's generative process, in the words of [55] : \"a composer creates songs, sections, and notes, and a performer realizes those notes with discrete events on their instrument, creating sound\". 2) MIDI is easy to interpret and modify. Users can interact with MIDI pieces generated from a network before the neural synthesizer plays them. On the other hand, MIDI's major drawback is that in order to learn from it, one needs large-scale annotated datasets. For piano music, [55] addressed this by creating such a dataset, but for general music we have not found a suitable dataset.",

            "text": "inpainting system: GACELA Our generative adversarial context encoder (GACELA) targets music inpainting in long gaps, i.e., in the range between hundreds of milliseconds and seconds. In this range, there are usually multiple plausible solutions for music inpainting and we consider the task as multimodal. For example, on a gap where originally a single chord was played, there could be several other chords that fill in the gap while still sounding plausible. For each chord there are even several variations: different intensities or onsets for each note. The multi-modality present at this range needs to be taken into account to model the task. Considering that a standard regression loss models a unique solution, it would lead to an average of the possible solutions and it is a bad fit for the task at this range. To solve this challenge, we model the task with a GAN, which is able to model the distribution of possible gap replacements instead of producing a single candidate. GANs rely on two competing neural networks trained simultaneously in a two-player min-max game: The generator produces new data from samples of a random variable; The discriminator attempts to distinguish between these generated and real data. During the training, the generator's objective is to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator attempts to learn to better classify real and generated (fake) data.",

            "text": "The proposed adversarial context encoder is comprised of a generator network and five discriminator networks, which consider the (generated or real) audio content in the gap region and its context at different scales. Each discriminator receives the generated (or real) gap data, as well as different amounts of context, encoded either as logmagnitude short-time Fourier coefficients or mel spectrograms, depending on the scale of the considered context. The generator, a context encoder conceptually split into two identical border encoder networks and one decoder network, is conditioned on the real border data encoded as mel spectrograms. Such conditioning is commonly achieved in GANs by supplying auxiliary data to both the generator and the discriminator, further specifying the generator's task. To date, several formulations of conditional architectures have been proposed [61] . In this contribution, we opt to condition solely on the close-range context, i.e., few seconds of TF audio data preceding and succeeding the gap. Converting the time-domain audio into a log-magnitude time-frequency representation partially solves the problem of scales, since a large number of audio samples are represented by a small number of time frames in the timefrequency representation. Hence, all audio data is transformed into, and represented by, log-magnitude short-time Fourier spectrograms and sometimes further processed into mel spectrograms [62] . The latter is the de-facto standard for a perceptually motivated dimensionality-reduced time-frequency representation and is well-suited as a basic encoding for larger scale conditioning data, when reduced precision is sufficient or even desired. The former on the other hand provides a redundant, highly detailed and interpretable representation of audio from which the source signal can be reconstructed in excellent quality by means of recent algorithms for phaseless reconstruction [63, 64, 65, 66] .",

Both encoder outputs and a realization of the latent variable are concatenated and passed to the decoder. The latent variable is drawn from a 128-dimensional uniform distribution. The decoder itself is comprised of a fully-connected layer with output size 8192, followed by 4 transposed convolution layers with Figure 2 : Overview of the generation process.

Discriminators: We adapt the multi-scale architecture from [76] to TF representations, with five discriminators operating on five different time scales and two different frequency representations. In the audio domain, multiple discriminators operating on different scales have successfully been used as well [42] , where the authors directly process time-domain audio. In the proposed architecture, all discriminators are supplied with time-frequency spectrograms and between successive discriminators, the receptive field is increased by a factor of two, see Fig. 3 . Every discriminator has five convolutional layers with stride 2. While the first two discriminators, with smaller receptive field, process log-magnitude STFT spectrograms directly, further discriminators process mel coefficients. Since the increased receptive field is achieved by time-averaging, the number of input time frames is equal for all discriminators. On the other hand, the input mel spectrograms supplied to discriminators 3 through 5 posses a reduced number of frequency channels, such that these discriminators were allocated 4 times less channels in every convolutional layer.

This way, we were able to estimate the impact the PGHI will have for an output of the network that does not present problems at a STFT level. Additionally, since we apply ODG to the full signals used on the listening tests, we also compute the ODG for the click signals, to corroborate that ODG is sensitive to localized distortions. The mean ODG obtained for 64 songs in the datasets used for the listening tests for both PGHI applied to the phase coefficients in the gap and a click applied at the beginning of the gap is presented in Table 2 . From this, we can see that on the two MIDI datasets and the maestro recordings, the effect of PGHI would be very hard for listeners to detect, and even then it would not be annoying. On the other side, the click would always be easy to detect and annoying. For the most complex dataset, i.e., free music, the influence of PGHI was between imperceptible and perceptible but not annoying, and the influence of the click was perceptible and between not annoying and slightly annoying.

A key variable here is how much context is encoded by the system since the amount of context is proportional to the computation time. Therefore, we evaluate how the context is being exploited by the network; we provide the encoder with different contexts drawn from the complexity level 3 and analyse the output it produces. Since the encoder is comprised only of convolutional layers, and convolution is translation equivariant, the encoder outputs preserves the localization of the information. Hence by analysing the output, we know which part of the input mel-spectrogram was encoded for the network to decode a solution for the gap. Fig. 6 shows different spectrograms that were given as input to the encoder before the gap and the average encoded output across channels. The sparse nature of the code tells us that the encoder puts his attention mostly on the two time bins adjacent to the gap. In the signal domain, this corresponds to roughly 1.4 seconds of audio content, when the full context represents 5.6 seconds. While not displayed, the situation is symmetric for the post-gap encoder. Fig. 7 shows different channels of the encoders output for one particular input. We observe here that even though the mean is focusing on the information closer to the gap, the rest of the mel-spectrogram is still useful and encoded.

In contrast, the neural network only takes a few seconds of audio context. b) SGA does not require any training and can adapt to multiple datasets and gap lengths, while our network needs hours of re-training for each new type of music and (currently) target gap length. c) SGA may modify the length of the gap, as well as the total length of the song and some uncorrupted audio content at the border of the gap. Our method only replaces the corrupted portion of the song. d) Once trained, filling the gap using the network is computationally more efficient than SGA. Since the conditions for both methods are so different, they suffer from different drawbacks. SGA always fills the gap with content that has the same audio quality as the rest of the piece, since it fills the gap with content from the piece. However, the two transitions between the borders around the gap can be unnatural if the algorithm picks an unsuitable gap replacement. Furthermore, this selection relies crucially on the existence of a good replacement in the current song. Eventually, SGA results can be erratic with the reconstruction being either very good or relatively poor with a good/poor ratio depending highly on the specific piece of music it is applied to. Our network is limited differently as it can only access a few seconds of information around the gap and only works on the type of data it has been trained on. Therefore, the perceived disturbances in the gap reconstruction are different from SGA. In general, the quality of the reconstruction is more uniform and the transitions are not the main source of artifacts.",

On the other side, our method can handle other conditions such as streamed signals where the full content is not available, signals that present repetitive corruptions in intervals such that long context is not available, or signals without repetition.

The almost perfect detection rate and small variance in the click condition demonstrates a good attention of our subjects, for whom even a single click was clearly audible. The clearly non-zero rate in the reference condition shows that our subjects were highly motivated to find artifacts. The detection rate in the inpainted condition was between those from the reference and click conditions. Note that the reference condition did not contain any artifacts, thus, the artifact detection rate in that condition is here referred to as the false-alarm rate. The large variance of the false-alarm rate shows that it is listener-specific. Thus, for further analysis, the detection rates from the inpainted condition were related to the listener specific false-alarm rate, i.e., the sensitivity index d' was used [85] . The false-alarm rate can be considered as a reference for guessing, thus, d' = 1 indicates that the artifacts was detected at the level of chance rate. The leftcenter panel of Fig. 8 shows the statistics of d' for the inpainting and the click conditions. For the click condition, the average across all subjects was 8.2 \u00b1 5.2, again demonstrating a good detectability of the clicks. For the inpainting condition, the average d' was 6.9 \u00b1 4.2, i.e., slightly below that of the click.

Given such a tiny change in the tested sound material, the origin of such a large change in the detection rates can be explained by having our experiment run into ceiling effects -The obtained sensitivities were high and well above the chance rate (d = 1 ).

Second, GACELA incorporates the inherent multi-modality of audio inpainting at this gap-duration range by being conditioned not only on the available information surrounding the gap but also on the latent variable of the conditional GAN.

The inpainted segments were more likely to be detected in sounds with larger complexity, with an exception found for the simplest complexity level represented as MIDI-generated piano music generated from artificial MIDI scores. Interestingly, our subjects were most sensitive to any type of corruption applied within this complexity level, confounding this part of results. The inpainting quality of GACELA did not change significantly for inpainting gaps with a duration ranging between 350 ms and 1500 ms.

The goal is to design a system receiving a new piece of music and generating a sound that is so similar that an attentive listener is not be able detect any artifacts. To this end, we expect future systems to better exploit auditory features and musical structures. In GACELA, the auditory features are represented by the compressed mel-spectrograms (conditioning the generator and input for three discriminators). In the future, generators directly producing features of an auditory space might provide improvements. A promising avenue in this regard are Audlet frames, i.e., invertible TF systems adapted to perceptually-relevant frequency scales [86] . GACELA aims to preserve the musical structure by relying on discriminators handling various temporal scales separately. More explicit features such as beat-and chord-tracking, incorporated to both the training of neural networks as well as their assessment might further improve the inpainting quality in future systems.",
