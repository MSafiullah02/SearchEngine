Based on these findings, treatment with anti-tuberculous agents was initiated. Chest radiographies revealed ill-defined patchy air-space consolidations in right lower lobe and left upper lobe of lung. Computed tomography of chest revealed multiple ill-defined foci, patchy opacities in left upper lobe of lung and ill-defined patchy consolidated opacities (>9 cm) in the right lower lobe of lung (Figure 1b). Several tests were conducted to identify the pneumonia-causing pathogen, including blood culture, sputum culture, Pneumococcus antigen test, Legionella antigen test, Mycoplasma test, Chlamydia antigen test, the test of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acid-fast stain and the polymerase chain reaction of tuberculosis in sputum, but the results were negative.\n",
