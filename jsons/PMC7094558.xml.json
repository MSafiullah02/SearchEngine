Multiple inactive vaccines can be conveniently and effectively administered at a single clinic visit.3 Administration of multiple live vaccines sequentially can impair the immune response; therefore, they should be given either simultaneously or separated by at least 4 weeks. Interruption in a vaccine series does not require restarting the series; generally the series can resume from the last administered dose. For instance, if a patient is receiving the hepatitis B series and receives the first and second injection at the appropriate interval (0 and 1 month) but misses the 6-month shot, the patient can receive it as soon as convenient without restarting the series de novo.Box 1Considerations for administering vaccines\nHistory of allergyPregnancy or immunosuppressionDestination and travel durationSeverity of disease versus risk of adverse effect from vaccinationUrban, rural, or remote from medical careVaccine availability, cost, and number of doses needed\n",

A stands for risk-awareness. The risk of contracting malaria varies with the destination, season, climate, altitude, and number of mosquito bites; up-to-date information is available on the CDC Web site. B is for bite-avoidance (see earlier discussion on avoiding insect bites in general). C is for chemoprophylaxis compliance. Prophylaxis is recommended for all travelers to endemic areas. Prophylaxis medications suppress malaria by killing asexual blood stages of the parasite before they can cause disease. Therefore, protective levels must be present when parasites emerge from the liver. Effective prophylaxis must start before first possible exposure and continue for a period after the last potential mosquito bite. The timing of starting and stopping prophylaxis varies by regimen, with some regimens needing to be started several weeks before departure, whereas others must be continued after the traveler returns home.11 There are many options for malaria prophylaxis, although in practice the decision is often made easier by the combination of timing of departure, willingness to take a daily medication, and tolerance of potential side effects. One recommended approach is depicted in Table 2\n.",

Travelers who may have sex with new partners abroad should bring latex condoms, because some studies have shown those manufactured abroad may be more prone to breakage.11, 17, 18 Populations found to be more likely to engage in sexual activity with new partners abroad or to have unprotected sex include younger travelers (<25 years age), men who have sex with men,19 expatriates,19 military personnel,20 and sex tourists18 (defined as those who travel with explicit intention of engaging in sexual activity).

The larvae penetrate human skin and migrate through the subcutaneous tissue. The migration causes the characteristic serpiginous pattern of CLM (Fig. 2\n).

Cutaneous leishmaniasis has 4 superficial manifestations: localized, recidivans, diffuse, and mucosal. The localized cutaneous form occurs on any exposed area of skin, starting as a red papule that enlarges to form a painless ulcer with heaped up margins and granulomatous tissue at the base (Fig. 3\n). These lesions are self-limited and the rate of resolution is determined by the particular infective species. A hypopigmented scar after ulcer resolution is common. Leishmaniasis recidivans is uncommon, and is caused by Leishmania tropica infections in the Middle East. After resolution of the primary lesion, a few remaining pathogens cause new papules to occur around the margins of the scar. These papules can appear, ulcerate, and heal repeatedly over decades. In patients with an impaired cell-mediated immune response, diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis can occur. Instead of a primary lesion that ulcerates, the organism disseminates to macrophages in other areas of the skin. Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis characteristically has a relapsing or chronically progressive course that may cause significant deformity. Mucosal leishmaniasis occurs as a late-stage complication of less than 5% of cases of L braziliensis infection, which is endemic to Latin America. Months to years after primary lesion has resolved, recurrence at a distant mucosal site may occur.",

If symptoms last longer than a week or bloody diarrhea is present, stool cultures should be obtained.

Leishmaniasis has 4 different cutaneous manifestations. The interval from infection to clinical manifestation can range from weeks to years depending on the particular species and host immune status. Leishmaniasis is diagnosed by obtaining a tissue sample and performing microscopy, histology, PCR, or culture. Treatment is lengthy and should involve a specialist.

Dengue has a spectrum of severity and treatment is supportive. The incubation period and clinical presentation of rickettsiosis depend on the particular infective species; diagnosis is primarily clinical and treatment is doxycycline. Enteric fever presents as abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Incubation is generally from 1 to 2 weeks and is less likely in patients who present more than 3 weeks after return from endemic countries.
