ACE-2 receptor has been recognised as a coreceptor for 2019-nCoV entry and known to be expressed in many parts of human body: gastrointestinal tract, lung, heart and kidney [20]. A recent publication has reported the increased expression of ACE-2 receptor in adipose tissue [21]. This means having more adipocytes is equal to be having more ACE-2 receptors to catch 2019-nCoV. Moreover, chronic inflammation in obesity is apparent with the increased interleukin 6 (IL-6) level, adipokines, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-a, inferferon), inducing a chronic low-grade inflammatory state in obesity and impairing immune response [12,13,19]. The total lung capacity has also been reported to be reduced in obese patients, and improved by bariatric surgery [22,23]. Moreover, a study by Campos et al. also emphasised the impact of obesity to reduce lung function in sedentary subjects [23]. Hence, obese patients tend to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and rapid severe disease progression due to its lower baseline lung functional capacity than normoweight people.",

Study by Ni Y et al. correlated obesity to a higher rate of heparin prophylaxis and hypertension. Heparin helped to reduce coagulation and systematic inflammatory response whereas hypertension reduced fluid or vasopressor requirement in circulatory failure [14]. This condition was thought to contribute to a diminished potential of disease progression to ARDS. However, Ni Y study made no attempt to explain the direct effect of obesity and ARDS, in contrast to the previous explanation through molecular and lung functional capacity changes in obesity. Hence, our study also shed light on the contrasting view of ARDS and obesity. The severity of ARDS and overall COVID-19 clinical manifestations increased in obese patients infected with COVID-19 and this population even showed a higher need of invasive mechanical ventilation [19]. Findings from COVID-19 which were discussed in this study were also in line with previous coronaviruses studies: coronavirusHKU1 [24] and MERS-CoV virus [25]. These studies had previously stated the increased prevalence and risk of obese people to coronavirus infection.",
