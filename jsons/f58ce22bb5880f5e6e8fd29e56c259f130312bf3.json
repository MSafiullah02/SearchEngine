The trachea conducts inhaled air into the lungs through dichotomic branching into tubular bronchi. They divide further into smaller bronchioles, finally becoming microscopic clusters of air sacs, called alveoli. Ciliated epithelia and mucosal glands build the inner lining of the conducting airways. These structures maintain epithelial moisture and ensure the mucociliary clearance of the airways by secreting mucus and maintaining an epithelial cell lining fluid. [1] Approximately 480 million alveoli form the respiratory surface of an adult human lung, [2] which is mainly composed of flat alveolar type-I cells (AEC-I). Together with endothelial capillaries located at the basolateral site of AEC-I, these cells form the approximately 2 mm-600 nm (sometimes only 200 nm) thin barrier allowing for gas diffusion. The AEC-I are flanked by cuboidal alveolar type-II cells (AEC-II), which are indispensable for the regulation of alveolar homeostasis by producing and secreting surfactant, [3] other bioactive mediators, and contributing to lung tissue repair. [4] During every breath, this extensive and intricate air-blood barrier is exposed to mechanical stress [5] and inhaled air (around 10.000 L day \u00c01 ) containing particles ranging from pollutants to allergens or infectious agents. The activation level of the resident alveolar immune cells such as macrophages [6] and dendritic cells, in concert with the lung epithelium, [7] decide if and how such inhaled agents induce a systemic or just a local immune response (\"keep calm\"). In cases of systemic activation, recruitment of further immune cells including polymorphonuclear granulocytes, [8] monocytes, [9] or T lymphocytes [10] contribute to combat the perturbing agents. Notably, certain circumstances, such as severe pneumonia, may lead to inadequate or overwhelming activation of such resident lung cells triggering a deleterious pro-inflammatory cascade significantly contributing to the development of life-threatening acute lung injury. [11] As there are major physiological differences between most animal lungs and human lungs, and animal models are unable to completely recapitulate human disease, ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) human lung models are required and helpful for understanding the underlying molecular and cellular events and mechanisms of such diseases in a functional, spatial, and timely manner. about 120 million episodes occurring in children younger than 5 years. Of those, around 14 million progressed to severe pneumonia, causing about 1.3 million deaths. [14] Furthermore, a study estimating the global burden of COPD for the same year identified more than 230 million cases among urban dwellers, and 153.7 million among rural dwellers worldwide, thereby providing an overview of the high prevalence of lung diseases in the population. [15] Additionally, diseases such as asthma also affect millions of people worldwide and show likewise an increasing prevalence. Although mortality due to asthma has decreased over the last decades, no curative therapy is available and personal constraints in daily life activities persist. [16, 17] Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. [18] Models, which more accurately reflect human lung cancer could help aid in our understanding of the deranged signaling networks and help identify and validate new potential therapies. Taken together, there is a high global burden of lung diseases ranging from the economic to the individual level [19] and a prerequisite to understand these diseases and to identify novel treatment options is the creation and validation of more complex models with multiple readout options that better mimic physiologic tissues and accurately reflect the clinical situation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 573, "end": 576, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 664, "end": 667, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1100, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1171, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1275, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1480, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1542, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1760, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1772, "end": 1775, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1797, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2113, "end": 2117, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2660, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2937, "end": 2941, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3227, "end": 3231, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3232, "end": 3235, "text": "17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3311, "end": 3315, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3612, "end": 3616, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "One could argue that the use of immortalized cell lines and animal models with rodents should reveal the essential information to understand and treat human lung disease. While there is no doubt that these techniques and approaches have helped to make major contributions to the field. The scientific community is increasingly recognizing that these models and their outcomes suffer from serious limitations. It is estimated that over 80% of the potential therapeutics deemed to be safe and effective in animals fail in humans due to non-rigorous study design, which raises ethical concerns with regard to the sacrificed animals as well as the patients, who receive ineffective agents with potential side-effects. [20] Moreover, lung anatomy, cellular composition, or molecular responses in man significantly differ from widely used animal models, such as rodents. [21] [22] [23] For instance, chronic bronchitis and COPD are characterized both by excessive mucus production. However, in contrast to humans, bronchial glands of mice and rats anatomically localize only to the proximal trachea making it difficult to reproduce this particular disease aspect. [24] In parallel to these challenges, current attempts to simulate the effect of cigarette smoke, air pollution, and lung cancer induction in animal models are limited in multiple ways by such basic animal-human differences. [22, [25] [26] [27] [28] Therefore, a vigorous debate has arisen in the last decade regarding the predictive value of mouse models in inflammatory diseases, across many diseases and organs. [29, 30] In that context, another intriguing example for the need to use primary human lung samples are emerging zoonotic infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), or new influenza A virus (IAV) pandemics. Several animal models are naturally not permissive to these severe infections or need virus adaption to the animal host by serial passaging, thereby affecting viral pathogenicity. Animal models often need transgenic expression of human receptors (e.g., human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS coronavirus (CoV), or human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for MERS CoV), or simply do not reflect the clinical course of the disease in humans. [31, 32] Furthermore, an inherent characteristic of a zoonosis is its specific occurrence between a distinct animal species and the human host. Species specific factors, but mostly unknown factors from both, the pathogen and the host, determine the zoonotic axis. Therefore, the investigation of fundamental factors defining how a pathogen crosses the species barrier must include material and infection models from these \"zoonotic partner species\" itself, meaning in the local context such as the human lung. [33] Although such complex human lung tissue models suffer from physiological limitations, it is obviously purposeful to make efforts toward analyzing the fundamentals of lung biology in the original tissue of interest. This tissue can be used to mimic the various diseases and even to elaborately analyze diseased tissue biopsies, which can serve as models themselves. In addition, the currently established human in vitro models require further improvement. For example, culture mediumsubmerged bronchial lung epithelia cells lack cilia and hardly form the tight junctions typically expressed in vivo and observed in air-liquid interface cultures. [34] There is thus a need to recapitulate the complex 3D structure and matrix of the lung tissue with a suitable cell mixture [35] to establish an appropriate intercellular network. [36] Besides those integrated models, human clonal or primary cells are useful for dissecting fundamental aspects of the biology of a single lung cell population in vitro, which is indispensable to complement the understanding of species specific signaling pathways.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 714, "end": 718, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 865, "end": 869, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 870, "end": 874, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 875, "end": 879, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1162, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1387, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1392, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1397, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1402, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1407, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1577, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1578, "end": 1581, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2292, "end": 2296, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2297, "end": 2300, "text": "32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2802, "end": 2806, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3452, "end": 3456, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3578, "end": 3582, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3634, "end": 3638, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the high medical need together with fundamental methodological considerations substantiate the necessity for development of human-based disease models for acute and chronic lung diseases.

Over the last decades, tissue engineering approaches have made tremendous progress. Several in vitro models for studying inhalation toxicity or diseases have been established, which aim to improve our understanding of (patho-)physiological processes and to provide novel and more reliant experimental systems for pharmacological and toxicological studies. Currently, in vitro lung models of all important segments of the respiratory system are available, starting from the nasal cavity and trachea down to the proximal and distal airways. [37] Cell culture models of human lung epithelium are based either on primary cells including normal human (trachea) bronchial epithelial cells (NH(T)BEC)), AEC, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived epithelial cells, [38, 39] or are generated using cell lines. iPSC derived epithelial cell organoids from patients with lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, or cells manipulated in vitro through gene editing have been recently shown to recapitulate functions known to be deranged in human lung disease. iPSC derived lung bud organoids have also been recently used for studying respiratory syncytial viral infection. [39] These models thus provide an opportunity to identify new treatments or to further understand the underlying biology of human disease. The most commonly used lung epithelial cell lines are Calu-3, H441, 16HBE14o-, and A549. These cell lines offer several advantages over primary cells such as almost unlimited cell source and passaging. However, they suffer from distinct limitations such as the lack of mucus production for 16HBE14o-or absent tight junction formation for A549. [40] To induce cell differentiation, cells are typically cultured on biocompatible scaffolds or matrices to mimic the natural environment. The matrices can consist of natural (e.g., collagen, gelatin, elastin, alginate, silk, Matrigel 1 ) or synthetic compounds (e.g., polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid). [41] An important step for improving the physiological relevance of these models is the culture of lung epithelial cells at the air-liquid-interface (ALI), since increased oxygen and air exposure play crucial roles for the development of a well-differentiated barrier. [42] Bronchial epithelial cells cultured under ALI conditions develop a threedimensional, multi-cellular epithelium comprised of basal cells as well as ciliated surface cells and goblet cells, whereas submerged cultures express substantially fewer ciliated cells. [43] Additionally, ALI cultures offer the opportunity for direct application of aerosols or solid particles onto semi-dry cell surfaces, more closely resemble the in vivo situation and can be kept in culture for several month. [44] In addition to the use of primary and immortalized cells for modeling normal cell biology, tumor models using human cells have become important tools for cancer research. Their complexity is dependent on the objectives and research questions. Tumor models have been developed to provide insight into, e.g., tumor growth, invasion, matrix remodeling, or drug delivery. Many lung tumor studies use spheroid models for therapeutic screening where clusters of cells undergo selfassembly to form viable, 3D tumor-like structures. Spheroids can be generated using low attachment U-bottom plates, [45] extracellular matrices (Matrigel TM ), [46] rotatory cell culture systems or the hanging drop method. [47] Hanging drops can be used to produce 3D mono-and co-culture spheroids for a better reflection of in vivo conditions of cancer cells to investigate, e.g., tumor-stroma interactions. [48] The culture time depends on the cell type and the experimental question. Small spheroids have been used for drug testing and large to recapitulate oxygen gradients with hypoxic regions or proliferation gradients. More complex models of lung cancer and tumors have been established to serve as tools to identify new drug targets. Three-dimensional decellularized tissue matrix derived from rodent lungs have been recellularized with human lung cancer cell lines to provide a perfusable tumor model. [49] Alternatively, a 3D collagen gel based model has been described which contains human lung adenocarcinoma cells, human lung fibroblast cells, and macrophages. [50] Several research groups have established 3D airway models for pulmonary research consisting of undifferentiated NHTB/biliary epithelial cells (BEC). [51, 52] Besides the use of in-house-models, well characterized, fully differentiated and standardized 3D human airway models are commercially available offering the major advantage of higher data reproducibility due to lower batchto-batch variabilities. These models are used for a wide range of applications including safety and risk assessment and research on, e.g., new anti-viral compounds, drug delivery systems, or common lung diseases such as inflammation and fibrosis. EpiAirway 1 (MatTek Corp., MA, USA) and MucilAir TM (Epithelix S arl, Suisse) are composed of normal NHTB/BEC from non-smokers, but epithelium mimicking several pathologies like asthma, COPD, or cystic fibrosis can also be obtained. OncoCilAir TM (Epithelix S arl, Suisse) is a 3D human lung cancer model combining functional reconstituted human airway epithelium, human lung fibroblasts, and lung adenocarcinoma cells which can be used for drug efficacy testing, toxicity effects, analyzing off-target-effects, and tumor recurrence. A major advantage of these models is their ability to be cultured for long-term. For example, OncoCilAir TM and EpiAirway 1 have a useful lifetime for up to 3 months, whereas MucilAir TM can be cultivated up to 12 months, allowing long-term and repeat toxicity and efficacy studies. The main disadvantages of commercial models are the lack of complexity and ability to be customized for particular applications. In this regard, in-house models offer more flexibility, particularly with regard to cell selection or cell manipulation like genetic modifications via gene knockdown or knockout. [53] Moreover, endothelial cells can be implemented to mimic the alveolar-capillary barrier [54, 55] or the models can be co-cultured with dendritic cells and/or Air-liquid-interface Self-made:

Besides the above-mentioned modification of including more cell populations in those models, a further area of improvement is the application of physical forces and motion to the culture systems. Benam et al. [58] presented a system in which human lung bronchial epithelial cells (from healthy individuals or asthma and COPD patients), differentiated in an ALI culture and grown on an extracellular matrix (ECM) coated dimethylsiloxane membrane, were integrated in a microfluidic system with cultured human endothelial cells on the lower side. The endothelial channel is perfused by culture medium. The culture of patient-derived airway cells in combination with the application of stimulating agents via the airflow or the perfusion channel (so via the vascular route) allowed for a great variety of functional studies including, e.g., the recruitment of immune cells from the bloodstream into the airways. The same group used this experimental setup to model the alveolar region of the lung. [59] [60] [61] By integrating a flexible membrane and a two side hollow chamber they induce stretching of both the epithelial cells grown on the upper side and the endothelial cells grown on the bottom side of the membrane, thereby simulating breathing motions of the lung. Notably, in this model, human alveolar cells were exposed to an airstream and thus cultured in ALI conditions (alias \"lung-on-chip\").

Early studies used direct postsurgical snap frozen or homogenized human lung tissue specimens for the analytical determination of molecular markers, [62] antibiotic metabolism, [63] or pathogen detection.

The most common method is the generation of thin slices of decellularized tissue, followed by direct application of cells. [95, 98, 99] This method is arguably the simplest to perform and allows for high throughput studies from a single acellular scaffold. However, it suffers from the fact that cells are seeded in two dimensions and the initial cell seeding is thought to be stochastic (e.g., cells randomly attach to the upper surface of the slice with no documented preference for adhering to the physiologic compartment corresponding to the cells in vivo location). Alternatively, cell suspensions can be injected into dissected decellularized tissue segments ($3 cm 3 ), and then further processed into thin slices. [105] If segments are not further sliced, cells in the inner portions of the scaffold will have limited access to nutrients and oxygen. The third high throughput method of recellularization allows for physiologic seeding of cells into either the airway or vascular compartments with an artificial pleura. [96, 97, 103] Primary human fibroblasts seeded on acellular lung scaffolds derived from patients with IPF were found to obtain a myofibroblast phenotype, as assessed by \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression. [95] In a follow up study, it was determined that the matrix, in which cells were seeded, played a more significant role in determining cell fate than the source of the cells (i.e., normal versus IPF). [106] Immortalized cells such as human fibroblasts (MRC5) have also been seeded onto normal acellular human scaffolds and stimulated with recombinant CHI3L (a prototypic chitinase like protein) to induce \u03b1-SMA expression and a contractile phenotype. [107] In addition to their usage in IPF research, acellular lung scaffolds derived from COPD patients have also been used. Cells seeded onto COPD scaffolds were unable to survive as long as they did on scaffolds derived from normal patients. [96] These cells were all grown under conditions known to stimulate proliferation in two dimensions on tissue culture plastic. This indicates that either the matrix itself or a component in the matrix/scaffold suppressed proliferation or enhanced cell death. In both instances, the findings in vitro match known hallmarks of human disease. However, it is important to note that mass spectrometry proteomics consistently detects a large number of non-ECM components in acellular human lung scaffolds from both normal and diseased origin, many of which are growth factors known to be involved in disease onset and pathogenesis. [95] Therefore, acellular scaffolds and results from these experiments should not only be viewed as models of cell-ECM interactions but should be interpreted as being models of the extracellular environment of normal or diseased lungs, including matrix sequestered growth factors.

Microfluidic systems are also instrumental to investigate the interaction of the lung with other organs (e.g., gut-lung axis, gut-liver-axis, human-on-a-chip [145] ) and to induce physical forces (\"breathing lung on chip\" [141, 143] ). Of particular importance is the addition of anat least-minimal functional immune system in the microfluidic systems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 325, "end": 330, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 331, "end": 336, "text": "[142]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 337, "end": 342, "text": "[143]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 343, "end": 348, "text": "[144]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 560, "end": 565, "text": "[145]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 624, "end": 629, "text": "[141,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 630, "end": 634, "text": "143]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Further Developments -Where Should We Go From Here?"}, {"text": "One of the biggest advantages of these models is accompanied by a great challenge: researchers are faced with the problem to gain cell-specific mechanistic answers out of a 3D structure built up from different cell types over time. One key method is therefore the further development of high-end live tissue microscopy techniques. Unfortunately, classical 2-photon microscopy has no significant advantage in living lung tissues compared to confocal imaging. [146] This is due to the strong light scattering of the chambered alveolar system, which limits both techniques. Next, lung tissue has very strong auto-fluorescence hampering specific fluorescence signal separation. Therefore, such methods must be combined with spectral microscopy, [147] and developed further with the fast (lattice) light sheet approach. [148, 149] To show the advantage of spectral imaging we demonstrate two examples, where we have illustrated that spectral microscopy and linear unmixing provides the possibility to overcome the high autofluorescence of the tissue and allows even for subcellular resolution of the complex cellular composition of the human Figure 2 .

It also gives an overview over techniques which come into focus and which need to be improved to adequately analyze such models.
