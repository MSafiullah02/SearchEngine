Moore and colleagues likewise reported no difference of pulmonary inflammation in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice 1 week after intratracheal injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate, despite later differences in lung fibrosis at day 21.19 Blease found only small differences in BALF cells after intratracheal challenge with Aspergillus.20 Traynor only found differences of total cell number in the lungs of Cryptococcus-infected nimals after 2 weeks of infection.21 Therefore it is likely that the lack of differences of pulmonary inflammation that we observed in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type animals was related mostly to the anatomic site in that pulmonary inflammation is often relatively normal in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, as opposed to the peritoneum.",

This is similar to findings in models of murine asthma and mycobacterial infection employing CCR2\u2212/\u2212 animals.20, 57 The nature of the pulmonary inflammatory response was not different in the CCR2\u2212/\u2212 recipients compared with the wild-type recipients (Fig 3, Fig 4). We did find differences in IL-12p40 and IL-6 in the BALF of the CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice and the control animals (Fig 4, Fig 5). Because we did not find a difference with regard to pulmonary histologic or BALF cellular response in the CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig 2, Fig 4), it is likely that these cytokines are not necessary for the expression of pulmonary inflammation in this adoptive-transfer model.",

This is likely a consequence of the redundant nature of the chemokine-chemokine receptor system, with multiple chemokines interacting with many different receptors, and perhaps the nature of the antigen we use. S rectivirgula can activate complement,58 cause secretion of inflammatory cytokines,59 and act as an adjuvant.60 In addition, timing of exposure to MCP-1 may be important. Overexpression of MCP-1 during sensitization of mice to either PPD or Schistosoma antigen markedly altered the extent of the granulomatous response, whereas overexpression after sensitization did not change the Th1- or Th2-type granulomatous response.61\n",
