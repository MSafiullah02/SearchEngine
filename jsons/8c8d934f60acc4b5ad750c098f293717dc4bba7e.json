The study aims to raise the awareness of gender equality issues through the work-life reflections. This is done to understand better the gender equality issue, and to give proposals to promoting equality also for the faculty members who teach ICT related subjects in the university. The data for the study was collected from 131 (n = 131) ICT alumni that represent 25 nationalities. Results reveal that men with 77% share dominate the closest supervisor positions and 14% of the previous ICT students in the university have felt some kind of gender-based discrimination in their work. The data-driven content analysis was used to analyze the data. In the analysis we found five main categories behind the gender-based discrimination: society, organizational; individual action; hard facts and zero. We argue, that society, organizational, and individual action proposals illustrate the digital transformation process.",

The digital transformation may be categorized into three dimensions: the use of new digital technologies; the change of organizational processes or the creation of new business models; and influencing all aspects of human life [4] . The digital transformation has changed the phenomenon of the digital divide from a situation of access to acquiring sufficient skills to use information and communication technology (ICT) effectively [5, 6] . Based on the latest OECD report [7] , digitalization, ICT and technical skills development are seen as key components for human well-being and social development. Nevertheless, a gender gap in the access, use, and ownership of digital transformation is still present in G20 economies [7] . This gap is defined as the digital gender divide. Based on the findings of OECD, the digitalization and fighting the digital gender divide offers opportunities, enhances women empowerment and holds promises for enhanced productivity growth. The digital gender divide is well recognized at the work-life balance: Women and girls with poor digital literacy skills will struggle to find jobs as technology advances and this is an urgent global problem [8] . It is argued that girls are less confident in their maths, science and IT abilities, often due to or fueled by societal and parental biases, and parents' expectations about the future of their teenagers by leading girls' lower engagement in science and ICTs [9] . The effective promotion of women\u00b4s digital adoption from the government, from the private sector and the civil society is proposed as one solution [10] . However, this is not enough. Also educational elements in fighting against the digital gender divide are needed. It is essential to understand the work-life reflections to be able to develop education. This paper aims to research the perceptions and reflections on gender equality in the context of ICT.",

Therefore, one purpose to carry out an alumni survey is to support the employability of graduates by improving the curriculum of the university according to the industry requirements. The latest alumni survey was carried out in the spring 2019 and it included equality related questions. In this case study, we are analyzing these alumni responses and proposals against inequality. The research question of this study is: What are the alumni experiences and perceptions towards equality in work in the context of ICT? Furthermore, we are interested in what proposals alumni will give to change the situation in the ICT context.",

I believe that women selecting career within IT/IS, have excellent opportunities to be successful. Now gender equality is such a topic that all companies take this issue seriously. The biggest challenge is to increase the amount of female workers in IT/IS clusters.

Individual action proposals are more or less at the same level. An example of woman proposal: \"I think it would be important to support the development of professional identity of all the students, but perhaps women need to be focused particularly, at least as long as there is a lack of role models for women. You could ask all the students how confident they are as ISS professionals, and how their confidence could be further enhanced, and make gender analysis of the results, too (Woman 12).\" Altogether, men gave 21 proposals and women nine proposals related to digital transformation and gender inequality.

These findings are important as high equality and free education in the society do not guarantee gender equality in the ICT field. Digitalization is the most powerful weapon which we can use to change the world and to create a new kind of future. No society, nowhere in the world, does afford to create the digital future under the gender bias, which today is an undesirable situation globally.",
