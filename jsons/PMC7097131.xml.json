            "text": "In 2009, the world experienced the H1N1 influenza, also known as the Swine Influenza, an epidemic which led to over 16455 deaths globally [51], 25,828 confirmed cases [36] and 428 deaths [37] in Canada alone. In Canada, this epidemic occurred in two waves, first wave occurred during the spring of 2009 whereas the second wave started around early October 2009 [5] and spanned about 3 months as it diminished by the end of January 2010 [31]. It is believed that genetic re-assortment involving the swine influenza virus lineages might be the main factor behind the emergence of H1N1 pandemic [22]. Various behavioral factors and chronic health conditions are considered to impose an increased risk of infection severity among H1N1 individuals. In particular, pregnant women, especially in their third trimester and infants are at increased risk of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission [8, 10, 23, 50]. Moreover, individuals with pre-existing chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic kidney and heart diseases, and obesity are at far greater risk of death and ICU admission in comparison to healthy individuals [11, 28]. Additionally, geographical location may also impart a great risk to the severity of the infection. It is observed that people residing in remote, isolated communities and aboriginals, in the Canadian province of Manitoba, experienced severe illness due to the pandemic H1N1 infections [45]. Most recent outbreak of 2014, in India, had reported 937 cases and 218 deaths from swine flu. The reported cases and deaths in 2015 had surpassed the previous numbers.

Clearly the state and the adjoint functions are bounded. Also it is easily verifiable that state system and adjoint system has Lipschitz structure with respect to the corresponding variables, from here we obtain the uniqueness of the optimal control for sufficiently small time T [16, 35]. The uniqueness of the optimal control pair follows from the uniqueness of the optimality system, which consists of (3.1) and (3.5), with characterizations (3.6). Note here the uniqueness of the optimal control is only for a certain length of time. This restriction on the length of the time interval arises due to the opposite time orientations of (3.1), and (3.5); the state system has initial conditions and the adjoint system has final conditions. For example see [15], this restriction is very common in control problems (see [27]). \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\square $$\\end{document}\u25a1\n",

It is well understood that in order to eradicate an epidemic, a large fraction of infected population needs to be treated. Therefore, an upper bound of 0.7 was chosen for treatment control. The optimal controls remain at higher values initially and then steadily decreasing to 0. In fact, at the beginning of simulated time, the optimal control is staying at higher values in order to treat as many infected as possible to prevent the susceptible individuals from getting infected and epidemic to break out. The steadily decreasing of the v is determined by the balance between the cost of the infected individuals and the cost of the controls.

It is easy to see that the optimal control is much more effective for reducing the number of infected individuals and decreasing the time-span of the epidemic. As normally expected, in the early phase of the epidemic breakouts, keeping the control at their upper bound will directly lead to the decreasing of the number of the infected people. Figure 7 shows the cost associated with the optimal and constant control strategy. It is clear the cost of optimal strategy is much less than the cost of constant strategy.
