            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a major disease in pigs that causes significant economic losses to industry across the world. In the United States alone, PRRS causes over $600 million in losses a year [1]. PRRS causes reproductive failure in pregnant sows and respiratory disease in young pigs. The causal virus, PRRSV, is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a lipid envelope, and belongs to the Family Arteriviridae, Order Nidovirales [2,3,4]. The genome is approximately 15 Kb long and encodes at least 22 different viral proteins including fourteen non-structural and eight structural proteins [5]. PRRSV induces both humoral and cellular immune responses in pigs and some of the viral proteins inducing such responses have been identified; however, protection against reinfection is incomplete [6,7,8,9]. Killed virus (KV) vaccines and modified live virus (MLV) vaccines for PRRS have been licensed for more than two decades. These vaccines generally reduce the severity of clinical signs and the transmission of virus; however, they do not induce sterilizing immunity. In general, the efficacy of MLV vaccines is superior to that of KV vaccines [10,11,12,13]. Importantly, however, highly variable and generally sub-optimal levels of protection against heterologous PRRSV strains have been reported [10,14,15,16,17,18]. The potential for reversion to the virulence of MLV vaccines and subsequent transmission to susceptible pigs is a concern [19,20,21].",

            "text": "The major challenge for the development of efficacious, broadly protective PRRS vaccines is the extraordinary genetic variation among disease producing PRRSV strains. Currently, two major PRRSV genotypes are recognized, Genotype 1 (European) and Genotype 2 (North American), which exhibit nearly 40% sequence dissimilarity [22,23]. Genotype 1 and Genotype 2 PRRSVs can be further divided into four subgroups and nine different lineages, respectively, based on phylogenetic analysis of ORF5 [24]. The co-existence of multiple variants within one farm, or even within individual pigs, possibly indicates the occurrence of quasispecies variation of PRRSV [25]. Thus, the development of vaccines that can induce protection against different subgroups and lineages is highly desirable. Multi-subunit vaccines [26], consensus vaccines [27], molecular breeding of different viral structural proteins [28], Mosaic T-cell vaccines [29,30], a polyvalent vaccine containing five different live-attenuated PRRSV strains [31] and DNA prime-MLV boost [32] are just some of the vaccines that are or have been under evaluation recently.",

Mosaic vaccines have been shown to elicit broader immune responses successfully and to confer cross protection in non-human primates and these Mosaic HIV vaccines have been trialed in humans [34,35,36,37,38]. We previously reported that a PRRSV Mosaic vaccine based on 748 GP5 sequences of the Genotype 2 PRRSV strain was immunogenic [29] and induced reactivity to four divergent Genotype-2 PRRSV strains that had at least 10% or more difference in their GP5 sequence\u2014as shown by the expression of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells\u2014and, further, that vaccinated pigs were protected against challenge with VR2332 [30]. The present study demonstrates further that vaccination of pigs with the GP5-Mosaic by using a DNA prime and rVaccinia boost approach protects them against strains that are more than 10% divergent in their sequences (VR2332 and MN184C).",

Therefore, the capacity of reducing VR2332 virus loads in serum was relatively similar between the GP5-Mosaic and the GP5-WT vaccines. Furthermore, there was a steady decrease in viral loads from 4 days to 14 days after challenge in both GP5-WT and GP5-Mosaic vaccinated groups, while viral loads increased during the course of challenge and reached their peak at 10 days post-challenge (DPC), then declining slightly at 14 DPC in the vector-control group (Figure 3A). In contrast, the viral loads in serum of animals receiving the GP5-Mosaic-vaccine were significantly lower than those of animals receiving the GP5-WT vaccine or those of vector-control animals at 7 and 14 DPC with MN184C (* p < 0.05) (Figure 3B), which was different compared to VR2332-challenged groups. Viral load levels in GP5-WT vaccinated animals, increased during the infection with MN184C and reached their peak at 10DPC, which is comparable to the vector-control group.

Viral loads in the lungs, TBLN, and tonsil were significantly lower in GP5-Mosaic-vaccinated animals than those in the vector-control group (* p < 0.05) after challenge with VR2332, while those of the GP5-WT group were significantly lower in the lungs, spleen and ILN compared to the vector-control group (* p < 0.05).

Recently, several vaccine candidates, including a synthetic consensus PRRSV strain [27], a chimeric PRRSV strain containing multiple ORFs DNA shuffled [46,47,48] and an intranasal live virus vaccine with adjuvant [49] induced various levels of heterologous protection in pigs. We have developed GP5-Mosaic vaccines that incorporate sequences derived from naturally circulating viruses. The data obtained from our GP5-Mosaic vaccinated pigs supports the Mosaic vaccine approach as an effective strategy to address PRRSV diversity. It has also been demonstrated that Mosaic T-cell vaccines have great potential for other viruses with extraordinary diversity, such as HIV [33,34,35,36,37,38]. In an earlier study, we demonstrated the immunogenicity of GP5-Mosaic vaccines in swine and their ability to induce cross-reactivity, as shown by their broad recall responses ex-vivo, and conferred the partial protection they provide in pigs [29,30]. The ability of the GP5-Mosaic vaccines to induce cross-protection in pigs against heterologous PRRSV strains was confirmed in the present study.",

The aa sequences were used to generate a phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining method [24]. The GP5-Mosaic 1 was closer to VR2332 (93% aa identity), while GP5-Mosaic 2 was closer to MN184C (90% aa identity), which suggested that the two GP5-Mosaic sequences broaden the coverage to strains belonging to different lineages.

In contrast, PBMC from GP5-WT vaccinated pigs expressed higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA only when stimulated with VR2332. These data were consistent with those of our previous study where the GP5-Mosaic vaccine induced broad recall cellular responses, as measured by significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression in response to the four diverse Genotype 2 PRRSV strains tested, including VR2332, NADC9, NADC30 and SDSU73 [30]. The significant induction of IFN-\u03b3 is an important asset of a PRRSV vaccine, as IFN-\u03b3 reportedly plays a critical role in the control of and protection from PRRSV infection [56]. In addition, both the GP5-Mosaic and the GP5-WT vaccines induced relatively high levels of neutralizing antibodies in VR2332-challenged pigs.

These data demonstrate that the GP5-Mosaic vaccine is capable of cross-protecting pigs against two divergent PRRSV strains (15% difference) while the GP5-WT vaccine only provided protection in pigs against the homologous strain. Furthermore, a similar pattern was found with respect to viral loads in tissues, where the GP5-Mosaic-vaccinated pigs had significantly lower viral loads in their lungs, TBLN, spleen, ILN and tonsils compared to the vector-control group after challenge with MN184C, while the GP5-WT group only showed slightly lower (numerically, but not significant) viral loads. In the VR2332 challenge experiment, both the GP5-Mosaic and GP5-WT vaccinates had significantly lower viral loads in tissues generally\u2014the viral loads in the GP5-Mosaic vaccinates were significantly lower in their lungs, TBLN and tonsils, while viral loads in the GP5-WT group were significantly lower in their lungs, ILN and spleen, compared to the vector-control group. Similar protective effects were also demonstrated in the GP5-Mosaic vaccine vaccinates, where lower viral loads were detected in the BAL fluids or PAMs after MN184C challenge, further confirming the cross-protective capability of the GP5-Mosaic vaccine. Indeed, this is finding may be particularly relevant since PAMs are the primary target of PRRSV infection. Lung lesion scoring is an essential and crucial method to evaluate vaccine efficacy, as infection by PRRSV tends to increase susceptibility to coinfection with other virus or bacterial pathogens [57,58,59] which may result in more severe lesions and mortality. Pigs vaccinated with the GP5-Mosaic vaccine had significantly lower lung lesion scores than both the GP5-WT and vector-control groups after challenge with MN184C, while both the GP5-Mosaic and GP5-WT groups had lower lung lesion scores compared to the vector-control group in the VR2332 challenge experiment.",
