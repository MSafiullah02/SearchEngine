The diagnostic work-up for Neuro-COVID is even more challenging. Neuroimaging cannot always provide a diagnostic certainty. A lumbar puncture could add relevant data to the diagnostic process but this test is rarely positive.(Ye et al., 2020) This could be explained by the mechanism of CNS invasion by SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting pathophysiologic events.",

The viral load in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should progressively increase till the second phase.2)The interaction between the spike protein S1 and the host ACE-2 receptor allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into the neuronal cells.(Mao et al., 2020) This mechanism determines a direct neuronal damage and the onset of symptoms such as anosmia and dysgeusia even in the early phase of infection.(Mao et al., 2020) Nevertheless, a severe respiratory impairment could be observed in case of nucleus of the solitary tract involvement.(Bertran Recasens et al., 2020) During the CNS clearance phase the viral load starts to decrease till the occurrence of the indirect SARS-CoV-2 effects on the CNS.3)The viral infection can lead to an immuno-mediated central nervous system damage. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 could trigger the production of antibodies against glial cells, as a para-infective or post-infective phenomenon, similarly to Epstein Barr Virus. In this phase the respiratory system could be severely affected leading to neurotoxic hypoxia with subsequent brain damage.\n",
