It has also been grown experimentally in the United States [6]. It grows up to 2 m high, with a long, cylindrical, branched, flexible, burrowing rootstock and horizontal, creeping, underground stems (stolons) of up to 1.8 m long, having buds which send up stems in the 2nd year.LV Leaves are alternate, pinnate, yellow-green leaflets, viscid on the underside. G. glabra var. typica is the most commonly used variety of glycyrrhiza. Its rootstalk and stolons are 6 to 18 mm thick, longitudinally wrinkled and sweeter than other types. It is one of the pharmaceutically important plants of India that is designated as on the verge of being endangered due to overexploitation and collection from the wild [115] (Figs. 1, 2 and 3).\n\n\n",

The plant has also been described by Theophrastus.XXI Author of Makhzan-el-Adwiya described licorice from Egypt to be the best, followed by from Iraq and Syria, and directs the root to be decorticated before use. The root is considered hot, dry and suppurative, demulcent and lenitive, relieving thirst and cough, and removing unhealthy humours from the body. It is also emmenagogue and diuretic, useful in asthma and irritable conditions of the bronchial passages. Avicenna recommended decoction in chronic fevers, tracheal pain, cold colic, and to clear voice; also dropped into eyes to strengthen sight.XL,LXIX,LXXVII Ibn Jazlah used it in leprosy, spleen ailments and scorpion sting, and in the Middle East it is used to relieve acute indigestion.LIII It concocts viscid humours in diseases of liver, bladder and lungs, and expectorates them.CV It has been used in Iranian herbal medicine for skin diseases, including dermatitis, eczema, pruritus and cysts [95], and for treatment of stomach disorders including peptic ulcers [58]. The herb extract inhibits gastric motility in vivo, which is regarded to be an important aspect for its antiulcer activity. GaborXLVIII reported paradoxical profile of licorice as possessing both anti-inflammatory and antiulcer activities; whereas most anti-inflammatory agents are ulcerogenic. It is a common ingredient of cough syrups, throat lozenges and pastilles for its flavor as well as its demulcent, mildly expectorant, and anti-inflammatory effects,XXI and is also used in irritable conditions of mucous membranes of urinary organs, gastric ulcers, Addison\u2019s disease and inflammatory conditions [6]. Former German Commission E believed it to be effective in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [92]. Decoctions of peeled dried root were formerly used to allay coughs, catarrh, bronchitis, sore throat, laryngitis, urinary irritation and pain associated with diarrhea. Liquorice provides two derivatives which reduce or cure gastric ulcers [37].",

Glycyrrhizin (GR) is a nonhemolytic saponin with foaming property [98], and one of the most potent hydroxyl radical scavengers [79]. Glycyrrhizin content in roots vary with season and age, rapidly increasing from October to November in 1-year-old roots, but did not show any significant increase from May to August in 3-years-old plants, whereas the isoliquiritigenin glycoside content increased up to October [52]. Glycyrrhizin content is higher in thick roots and rhizomes than in thin ones, and the highest content of GR is found in rhizomes 1.1\u20132 cm in diameter; there is little difference in the GR content of vertical and horizontal rhizomes [51, 78]. Hayashi et al. reported variation in GR contents from 3.3 to 6.1% of the dry weight, and that of glabridin, from 0.08 to 0.35% of dry weight in samples of rhizomes and roots collected from Uzbekistan [53]. Samples collected from various sites in Italy also showed remarkable differences in active constituents and biological activity [106]. Roots also contain phenolic compounds, formononetin, hemileiocarpin, hispaglabridin B, isoliquiritigenin, glabrene, glabridin, 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin, paratocarpin B, phaseollinisoflavone (phytoalexin), glabrol, salicylic acid, and O-acetyl salicylic acid (0.15%) [73]; hispaglabridin B, isoliquiritigenin, and paratocarpin B are reported as the most potent antioxidant agents [29]. Kitagawa et al. isolated flavonoids, glucoliquiritin apioside, prenyllicoflavone A, shinflavone, shinpterocarpin and 1-methoxyphaseollin from samples collected from Xinjiang province of China [62]. Phenolic constituents, licopyranocoumarin, glycycoumarin and/or licocoumarone, are found in G. uralensis but not in G. glabra; whereas glabridin and glabrene are found in G. glabra but not in G. uralensis [50]. Glabridin is a species-specific flavonoid of G. glabra, and not found in other species of glycyrrhiza [53]. Other phenolic compounds, 5\u2032-formylglabridin, (2R,3R)-3,4\u2032,7-trihydroxy-3\u2032-prenylflavane, (3R)-2\u2032,3\u2032,7-trihydroxy-4\u2032-methoxyisoflavan, kanzonol X, kanzonol W, glabrol, echinatin, shinpterocarpin, licoflavanone A, shinflavanone, gancaonin L, and glabrone exhibit significant PPAR-\u03b3 ligand-binding activity [65]. Two flavonosides, glychionide A and B, were isolated from the roots by Li et al. [68]. Two caffeic acid derivative esters, viz. eicosanyl caffeate and docosyl caffeate possess potent elastase inhibitory activity, and moderate antioxidant activity [36]. Two saponins, glabranin-A and B, are glycosides of glycyrrhetic acid [113]. Oleanane-type triterpene saponins, licorice-saponin M3, licorice-saponin N4, and licorice-saponin O4, were isolated by Wei et al. [119]. Seven constituents, with antioxidant capacity were identified as the isoflavans (hispaglabridin A and B, glabridin, and 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin), the two chalcones (isoprenylchalcone derivative and isoliquiritigenin), and the isoflavone, formononetin; glabridin being the most abundant and potent LDL antioxidant [114]. Coumarin derivatives present are herniarin and umbelliferone;XXIV also, the flavones liquiritin, liquiritigenin [55], isoliquiritin and isoliquiritigenin (responsible for yellow color) and the glycosides liquiritoside and isoliquiritoside, which, together are credited with licorice\u2019s antiulcer activity, and two flavonoids, rhamnoliquiritin and rhamnoisoliquiritin have been reported [112].",

Licorice has been shown to inhibit tyrosinase activity in vitro, a rate-limiting oxidase enzyme involved in the formation of melanin [67]. Glyderinine, a derivative of GR produced pronounced anti-inflammatory effects [12], exceeding activities of hydrocortisone and amidopyrine; also showed analgesic and antipyretic effects, but unlike most NSAID, did not suppress hemopoiesis or cause gastrointestinal ulceration. Hydroalcohol extract showed antiulcer activity against various ulcerogenic stimuli, comparable to cimetidine and even better than omeprazole [58]. GutGard\u00ae, the standardized extract reduced ulcer index and increased gastric pH, due to its cytoprotective and antioxidant properties [76], also protected against indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers in rats, with reduced acid output and increased mucin secretion, increase in PGE2 release and decrease in leukotrienes [60]. Combination of cimetidine and deglycyrrhizinated liquorice provided greater protection against aspirin-induced gastric ulcers in rats than low doses of either drug alone [17]. Aqueous extract is a strong inhibitor of adhesion of H. pylori to human stomach tissue [120]. The flavonoids, glabridin and glabrene inhibit in vitro growth of sensitive, and clarithromycin- and amoxicillin-resistant strains of H. pylori [46]. Isoliquiritigenin produces dual dose-dependent effect on the intestine, inhibitory at low doses and prokinetic at the high doses; the former effect is predominantly due to calcium channels blockade, while the latter may involve muscarinic receptors activation [28]. Aqueous extract was protective against APAP-induced hepatorenal damage in mice [102]. Oral or i.v. administration of licorice extract caused choleretic effect in rats, and umbelliferon, a minor component, was identified responsible for it [90].",

Fresh aqueous extract inhibited growth of standard strain and two clinical isolates of C. albicans; however, the activity was lost after storage for 24 h, even at 4 \u00b0C [75]. Ethanol extract is remarkably active against P. acnes, with negligible induction of resistance [80]. The flavonoid rich standardized commercial extract (GutGard\u00ae) and one of its constituents, glabridin were significantly active against H. pylori, but even at higher concentration, GR showed no activity [10]. Glabridin was also active against M. tuberculosis and many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [48], and against drug resistant mutants of C. albicans [41]. Aqueous extract was active against HSV-1, [94] and GR inhibited plaque formation in three strains of Japanese encephalitis virus [13]. Hispaglabridin A and B, 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin, glabridin, glabrol and 3-hydroxyglabrol, all exhibit significant antimicrobial activity [73]. Glycyrrhizin inhibits growth and cytopathology of several unrelated DNA and RNA viruses, without affecting cell activity and ability to replicate [87]. Animal studies showed reduction of mortality and viral activity in HSV encephalitis and influenza A virus pneumonia. In vitro studies revealed antiviral activity against HIV-1, SARS related coronavirus, RSV, arboviruses, vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus [43]. 18-\u03b2 glycyrrhetinic acid was also active in a pH-dependent manner against C. albicans strains, isolated from patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [86], and strong antiviral activity against rotavirus [63].",

It was reported to be the most potent out of a number of Indian medicinal plants for its hypolipidemic/hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant effects [116]. Ethanol extract significantly reduced LDL-C and increased HDL-C of dyslipidemic Syrian golden hamsters [72]. Methanol and aqueous methanol extracts [121] and aqueous and ethanol extracts [117] demonstrated high in vitro radical-scavenging activity. Licorice extract, due to its antioxidant properties, protected rats against toxic effects of ochratoxin A, one of the most common food-contaminating mycotoxins [71]. Freeze-dried aqueous extract is a strong suppressor of adrenal-pituitary axis in rats, significantly decreases concentrations of cortisol, ACTH, aldosterone and K+, and increases concentrations of Na+, and stimulates renin production by the kidneys [4]. Ethanol extract has shown antiandrogenic property in castrated rats [123]. Fractions of ethyl acetate extract have displayed estrogenic activity; several of them showing higher responses than the natural hormone 17\u03b2-estradiol, but glabridin not exerting any estrogenic activity [105].",

Bardhan and colleagues reported no significant effect of deglycyrrhizinised liquorice on gastric ulcer in an RCT of British patients [15]; whereas, Brogden and associates had earlier reported it effective in peptic ulcers [20]. Treatment of healthy men with licorice for one-week decreased salivary testosterone values by 26% but no significant decrease in free testosterone [7], and nine healthy women treated with 3.5 g of licorice containing 7.6% of GR daily for two cycles, had their mean total serum testosterone decreased by 37% at the end of 2nd month. This property could be useful as an adjunct therapy of hirsutism and PCOS [8]. In a double-blind RCT, topical application of a gel preparation (2%, containing 19.6% GR) was effective in significantly reducing scores of erythema, edema and itching after two-weeks treatment of 30 Iranian patients with atopic dermatitis [95]. An emollient cream containing milk proteins and licorice extract used as adjuvant to topical corticosteroid treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis in Italian patients for four-weeks also produced significantly greater improvement than the cortiocosteroid therapy alone [24]. Licorice tincture stimulates immune cells in humans within 24 h of ingestion that continues for at least 7 days [21, 126].",

            "text": "Various mechanisms have been suggested for its antiulcer activity. cAMP and cGMP have been implicated in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. One of licorice constituents, glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits PDE activity, thus increasing levels of cAMP of gastric mucosa of the pylorus and cardia, and suppressing gastric acid secretion. It did not, however, affect adenylate cyclase [5]. Antiulcer effect of GR is due to increased local concentration of PGs that promotes mucous secretion, and the hepatoprotective effect is mediated through inhibition of PLA2, and increasing hepatocytes survival [72]. Isoliquiritigenin relaxes isolated guinea-pig trachea through various intracellular actions, including inhibition of PDEs [69]. Hydroalcohol extract also inhibited 5-LOX and COX-2 enzymes, inhibiting formation of both eicosanoids and LTs [54]. GR, due to the steroid-like structure of its aglycone, \u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid is credited for its anti-inflammatory and antiallergic activities, which also possesses immunomodulatory properties [64]; and liquiritigenin is credited for the antiallergic activity [104]. However, the in vitro inhibitory effect on formation of both eicosanoids and LTs has been ascribed to glabridin and isoliquiritigenin and not GR [27, 107]. Antidepressant activity of aqueous extract is suggested to be mediated by increase of brain NE and DA, and MAO inhibiting effect [39]. Inhibition of carcinogen metabolism to active metabolite and DNA adduct formation could be the possible mechanism(s) of antitumor activity [2].",

            "text": "Revers first reported reduction in abdominal symptoms as well as radiographic evidence of healing of gastric ulcer, after administration of a paste prepared from dried watery extract of the roots [93]. However, later clinical studies observed that approximately 20% of treated patients developed facial and dependent edema, often accompanied by headache, shortness of breath, stiffness, and pain in the upper abdomen, which subsided after reduction of the dose [97]. Various reports of licorice toxicity emerged from Western countries in the 1950s, 60s and 70s about hypokalemia, hypertension and paralysis [11, 109]. Licorice was even declared to damage health [108]. Chopra et al. warned that licorice should be avoided by persons with cardiac problems, hypertension, kidney ailments, and those who are overweight or having difficult pregnancies.XXI Excessive licorice ingestion led to cardiac dysfunction and severe hypertension [16, 18, 32, 33, 47, 118];XXVIII most cases were resolved after cessation of licorice and potassium replacement without any sequelae. However, some cases of serious poisoning were reported, including death due to cardiac arrest [14]. A Californian woman developed pain in arms and legs, aggravated by muscular activity, after consuming large quantities of licorice to lose weight [110]; women also developed acute quadriparesis and paralysis due to severe hypokalemia, after consuming for long period a product containing licorice [9, 77]. Borst et al. [19] first reported that the GR moiety of liquorice was responsible for fluid retention and electrolyte imbalance. Glycyrrhizin in licorice has mineralocorticoid-like effect, and chronic intake induces a primary hyperaldosteronism-like syndrome resulting in sodium and water retention and loss of potassium, increasing extracellular fluid and plasma volume, leading to hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis [25].CXI The hypermineralocorticoidism and pseudoaldosteronism are due to the inhibitory activity of GR on 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [42]. Kabeeruddin mentions it harmful for kidneys and spleen.LXXVII",
