Most frequent symptoms observed in the largest study on hBoV epidemiology and clinical symptoms were cough, throat, rhinorrhea, and fever, thus presenting as the common cold.5, 7 Arnold and co-workers7 found that most patients (63%) were below 12 months of age, thus it cannot be excluded that the patient described here (2 years of age) suffered from a reinfection. In contrast to the recent study by Weissbrich et al.,8 who observed a high rate of coinfections (39%), no accompanying and hitherto known pathogen was detected in the recent case. Thus, although it remained still impossible to fulfil Koch's postulates, and although a coinfection with another respiratory pathogen cannot be fully excluded, it seems probable that the current episode was indeed induced by hBoV.",
