Due to an order by the Dutch Government, all gatherings (even of less than 100 people) are prohibited until June 1. The ESGAR 2020 Annual Meeting, with its planned date from May 19 -22, falls under the scope of this ban. In anticipation of this aggravation of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictive measures by the Dutch Government, ESGAR was cancelled on March 20.

Performance of LSN for diagnosing PSVD was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Student's t test and ANOVA were used. Results: Patients were mostly men (110, 71%), with a mean age of 56\u00b110 yrs (range 29-79). Overall, PSVD patients had a lower LSN value than patients with cirrhosis (2.70\u00b10.63 vs. 3.23 \u00b1 0.74, p<0.001). AUROC of LSN was 0.71\u00b10.04. A cutoff value of 2.73 had a specificity of 74% for the diagnosis of PSVD. Stratifying cirrhosis patients by Child-Pugh score, LSN of patients with PSVD was lower in Child A (p=0.002) or Child B (p=0.005) patients, but not in Child C (p=0.40). Spleen diameter was significantly higher in patients with PSVD (mean 160 \u00b1 47 vs. 138 \u00b1 30mm, p<0.001). Combining LSN<2.73 and splenomegaly increased the diagnostic performance (AUROC=0.79\u00b10.04). Conclusion: LSN quantification is a promising new tool for the differentiation between PSVD and cirrhosis, especially in patients with compensated disease.

Grade 2 or 3 portal hypertension was significantly higher in the NCPF group than in the LC group (P \u2264 0.003). In the NCPF group, six patients (14.0%) had at least one focal hepatic lesions with arterial hyperenhancement. The most common pathologic diagnosis (4/6, 66.7%) was focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) . No malignant lesion was detected during the follow-up period (mean, 60.7 months). Conclusion: In patients with portal hypertension, the absence of liver surface nodularity with higher grade portal hypertension is a suggestive feature of NCPF rather than LC. Benign focal lesions, most commonly FNH, were commonly accompanied in NCPF.

At 1 month postintervention, sensitivity was significantly greater in the intervention arm than the control group ( Results: Over the study period, 4878 CTCs were performed on a total of 4797 patients. CTC detected 173 CRCs. Over 36 months of follow-up, we found 12 post-imaging CRCs. Thus, the post-imaging CRC rate was 6.49 (95% CI 3.40 -11.10) per 100 cancers, and 2. 46 (1.27 -4.29) per 1000 CTCs. In retrospect, nine lesions were present on the index examination, two had sub-optimal CTC examinations, and one case was not visible on retrospective review. In cases of missed CRC, a) the initial study was not reported using flythrough and b) mean reporting times were significantly lower than the global mean. Conclusion: We suggest that routine use of virtual flythrough when reporting CTC may reduce the rate of interval colorectal cancers. In sub-optimal studies, the report should be explicit that a repeat examination should be considered.",

Five readers performed a blinded subjective image analysis, by means of four-point Likert scales from 0 (highest score) to 3 (worst score). Endpoints were the quality of large bowel cleansing and tolerance to the assigned bowel preparation regimen. Results: Seventy-eight patients were randomly allocated to treatments (44 in FBP group, 34 in RBP group). Both groups resulted in optimal colon cleansing.

Hansen; Vejle/DK Purpose: CT scan is standard in preoperative local staging of colon cancer. Tumours with a deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) system are characterised by unique clinical and pathophysiologic aspects that may impact the accuracy of the preoperative CT staging. Material and methods: Data from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group national clinical database addressing a cohort of patients operated for stage I-III colon cancer during 2010-15 were analysed. The analyses of MMR status had been conducted consecutively through means of immunohistochemistry. All CT scans were blindly assessed by a certified radiologist. Results: Data from 590 patients, operated at a specialised cancer centre, were available for analyses. 135 (22.9%) of the patients had tumours demonstrating dMMR. The overall correlation of the clinical and pathological T-category was significant for both groups. There was an inferior correlation between clinical (cN) and pathological (pN) N-category (p>0.05) in pMMR cancers with a higher degree of over-staging assessed by CT scan compared to a significant correlation between cN and pN stages in pMMR cancers (p<0.01). Of the 91 dMMR tumours assessed node-positive by the preoperative CT scan, 59 (64.8%) showed no sign of metastatic involvement at the postoperative assessment. Conclusion: Preoperative CT staging of dMMR colon cancer seems to overestimate nodal involvement and two-thirds of the patients preoperatively judged node-positive are false positive. The overall clinical value of a routine assessment of MMR status in the diagnostic setup is evident and the current study argues for implications to treatment decisions as well.",

R.M. Hodnett, R.A.K. Ibrahim, G. Miles, M. Puckett, E.M. Armstrong, S. Aroori; Plymouth/UK Purpose: At our tertiary hepato-pancreatico-biliary surgical centre, imaging of pancreatic and periampullary malignancy is performed and reported at patients' local hospitals before referral, and reviewed for multi-disciplinary team meeting (MDTM) by specialist GI radiologists at our centre. There is resultant heterogeneity of imaging and reporting practice. We assess whether using a reporting template reduces heterogeneity and improves report quality and, ultimately, patient outcomes. Material and methods: This audit was registered with our centre's audit and assurance team; ethical approval was not required. A surgical database search identified all surgically managed patients with confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic/peri-ampullary malignancy over 18 months. The CT imaging available at time of decision to operate was anonymised; reports were audited against a modified National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN) reporting template. New reports were produced by two experienced GI radiologists utilising the same template and compared to the original reports. Portal-phase CT and/or positron-emission tomography (PET) findings were analyzed by two board-certified radiologists in consensus for the following items: size, shape, margin, degree of enhancement and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, homogeneity, presence of intralesional fat, necrosis, calcification, adjacent organ invasion, peritoneal thickening, and mass effect. For quantitative analysis, the Hounsfield unit (HU) of lesions and psoas muscles as well as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the lesions were measured. Imaging findings were compared between desmoid tumor and peritoneal seeding groups using statistical analysis methods. Results: Desmoid tumors frequently showed iso-attenuation (14/17) while peritoneal seeding depicted high attenuation (12/16) compared to psoas muscle (P=0.001). Intralesional fat was more frequently found in desmoid tumors (8/17) than in peritoneal seeding (1/16) (P=0.017). Desmoid tumors frequently showed well-defined margin (9/17) and smooth contour (13/17) whereas peritoneal seeding had ill-defined margin (13/16) and lobuating contour ( ",

Taghavi Material and methods: Thirty-eight consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed small intestine or pancreatic NET (grade 1=24/grade 2=14), treated with SSAs underwent contrast-enhanced CT. The whole liver was semi-automatically delineated on arterial phase with Philips Intellispace Portal, excluding main vessels and bile ducts. Five histogram features were extracted with Pyradiomics, using different Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) filters. Response (progressive disease (PD) vs. stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR)) was assessed with RECIST1.1. Response and grade (1 vs. 2) were compared with Mann-Whitney U or independent t test. Univariate Cox regression was used for overall survival (OS) analyses. Results: 10/38 patients had PD (median follow-up 53 months) and 28 had PR/SD (median follow-up 65 months, p=0.065). Radiomics features did not significantly differ between patients with PD compared to patients with PR/SD. Kurtosis (unfiltered+LoG0.5) was significantly different between patients with grade 1 and 2 NET (p=0.05). Skewness, mean (LoG2.5) and kurtosis (LoG2.5) were significantly associated with OS (HR 0.76 (95%CI: 0.61-0.95); HR 1.96 (95%CI: 1.07-3.60) and HR 1.07 (95%CI: 1.02-1.12), respectively). Conclusion: These preliminary data show no value for whole-liver CT-based radiomics to identify NET patients treated with SSAs that will show progression. Whole-liver CT-based radiomics might show the potential to identify patients at risk of impaired outcome (i.e. higher grade and OS). These findings need to be validated in a larger cohort and lesion-based analysis will be explored to investigate whether this leads to better results.",

Jenkins; London/UK Purpose: Development of peri-anal fistula mucinous adenocarcinoma (MA) is a presumed rare but recognised event in patients with fistulating peri-anal Crohn's disease. The true incidence is unknown with a lack of robust registry data. Fistula mucinous cancers may evade early diagnosis, often necessitating morbid exenterative surgery. This study aimed to improve early detection of these cancers. Material and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 8 cases of biopsy-proven MA that had developed within Crohn-related anal fistula. MRI studies pre-dating the diagnosis of malignancy were reviewed to establish whether there are early predictive features of MA. Demographic, disease and surgical history were collected. Results: The median time to histological diagnosis of MA from the time of diagnosis of Crohn's disease was 426 (96-480) months and from diagnosis of fistulating disease 66 (24-156) months. On review of MRI, characteristic \"budding\" appearance within the T2 high-signal \"sepsis\"/fistula tract is noted in all of our MA fistula cancers. This finding pre-dates the histological diagnosis of MA by a median of 42 months (12-156). Metastatic disease was not detected in any of the 8 cases. Potentially curative pelvic exenteration was possible in 7 patients. Conclusion: There is an opportunity for early detection of the development of MA in anal fistula by recognition of \"budding\" within the tract. Earlier diagnosis may lessen the magnitude of subsequent radical surgery following prolonged growth of these lesions. Long-standing Crohn's anal fistula should be surveyed with MRI and any finding of \"budding' within the tract on T2 sequences should prompt urgent examination under anaesthetic and biopsy.",

Evaluation of skeletal muscle mass was made by measuring the psoas muscle (PMA) and total abdominal muscles areas (TAMA), in a semi-automated way, using a specific software at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. Results: 90 patients (mean age 61 \u00b1 9 years) were included. Mean pre-TIPS MELD score was 12\u00b14. The average time between CT and TIPS was 56 days. 16 patients (17%) died within 6 months of TIPS creation. Univariate analysis demonstrated that PMA, TAMA, hemoglobin level, white blood cell count, serum albumin, serum bilirubin, portal pressure gradient (PPG) and MELD score pre-TIPS were strongly associated with 6-month mortality after TIPS. PMA had an area under the ROC curve of 0.702 for 6 months mortality and a PMA cutoff of 16 mm 2 (sarcopenia) was correlated with mortality. At multivariate Cox regression analysis sarcopenia, leucopenia, MELD score and PPG were independent predictors of post-TIPS 6-month mortality. Conclusion: Sarcopenia, assessed by PMA on standard CT images, should be considered a risk factor for 6-month mortality in patients with cirrhosis who undergo TIPS placement for refractory ascites. Results: Mean pre-TIPS MELD score was 13.9 \u00b1 3.5. Before TIPS, 18 patients (21%) had a history of portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE). Sixteen patients (19%) had severe portal vein thrombosis (PVT). After TIPS, the portosystemic pressure gradient (PSG) decreased from 15.6 \u00b1 4.5 to 6.5 \u00b1 2.6 mm Hg (p<0.001). In 3 patients (3.5%) with severe PVT, VCX was directly dilated to 10 mm diameter reaching the hemodynamic target (PSG < 12 mmHg and/or PSG reduction \u2265 40%). In 82 patients, VCX was initially dilated to 8 mm achieving hemodynamic success in 77; in the 5 remaining patients (6%) not reaching the hemodynamic target, VCX was further dilated to 10 mm with a final PSG < 12 mmHg.

Purpose: To investigate the potential and limits of US fusion imaging (US-FI) in the percutaneous ablation of hepatic malignancies, assessing when this technology is essential, calculating its impact on the timing of the procedure. Material and methods: 16 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled and a total of 34 lesions (28 hepatocellular carcinomas, 6 metastases) were treated by percutaneous radiofrequency ablation or ethanol injection with US-FI guidance. Main clinical, laboratory and CT/MR imaging parameters were evaluated before and after the procedure. At the end of every single ablation, a score survey (from 1 to 10) was submitted to the radiologist. Timings of the procedure were collected. Results: 30% of the lesions were local recurrence of a previous ablation; in these cases, US-FI was judged to be more useful than in primary treated lesions (p=0.021). Complete ablation was achieved in 88% of cases. US-FI was more useful when the lesion was not conspicuous in B-mode (p<0.001). US-FI significantly changed the perception of lesion size in 70% of cases. The overall confidence of the operator was highly increased by US-FI in 68% of the procedures. Mean duration of the entire procedure was 17m and 50s. In 71% of cases, the radiologist had the perception of having spared time using US-FI, especially in local recurrence treatment (p=0.024). Conclusion: US-FI increases the conspicuity of target lesions and the confidence of the operator. US-FI is particularly useful for the targeting of less conspicuous lesions and for the treatment of recurrences of previously ablated lesions. In these cases, US-FI is a time-sparing method. ",

Material and methods: 36 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study, all underwent a pre-and post-CRT conventional MRI study followed by surgical resection with a median 36-month follow-up. A 5-point mrTRG and mrTRG_DWI were assessed by two expert radiologists and finally compared with pTRG.

Material and methods: In this retrospective, IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant study, we reviewed all patients from 1/2014 to 7/2019 who presented with overt GIB and had active extravasation on CTA. Extravasation volume (EV) was calculated using 3D segmentation software. Imaging data were correlated with clinical data, including if further workup was pursued, active bleeding was identified, and blood transfusions were required following CTA. Results: 50 consecutive patients met inclusion criteria, corresponding to 6 (12%) upper, 18 (36%) small bowel, and 26 (52%) lower GIB. 42 patients underwent further workup with catheter angiography, endoscopy, or surgery, with a median elapsed time of 9 hours between CTA and further workup. Of 42, 16 (38%) had active bleeding intra-operatively and all underwent intervention with successful hemostasis. Arterial extravasation volume was 2.72\u00b12.97 mL for those with active bleeding and 0.76\u00b11.01 mL for those without (p=0.0009). Using a threshold volume of 0.80 mL, the odds ratio of requiring massive transfusion was 7.0 (95% confidence interval 1.9-26; p=0.004), identifying active bleeding was 11.8 (2.6-54; p=0.002), and therapeutic yield was 6.8 (1.5-30; p=0 .01). Using a previously described mathematical model, bleeding rate can be estimated from extravasation volume and attenuation, and the lower limit of detected bleeding rate was calculated to be < 0.1 mL/minute. Conclusion: Larger extravasation volumes may be used to triage patients who require additional management and improve therapeutic yield. Current CTAs can detect bleeding rates lower than 0.1 mL/minute.",

Histopathological slides were reviewed by an experimented pathologist to assess patients with no or limited necrosis to the mucosa or submucosa and those with extended necrosis and to compare CT features in each group. Interobserver agreement (K) was assessed for each CT finding. Results: Twenty-five patients (50%) were classified as group limited necrosis and 25 patients (50%) as group extended necrosis. The most frequent CT signs observed were the abnormal wall enhancement (76%) and colon wall thickening or thinning (82 and 70%, respectively). Parietal pneumatosis (PP) was found in 8 patients (32%) of the group extended necrosis against 2 (8%) in the group limited necrosis (p: 0.024) with a sensibility for detection of extended necrosis of 0.32 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.15 -0.53) and a specificity of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74 -0.99).Portomesenteric venous gas (PVMG) was mostly seen in the group with limited necrosis (5/6 patients, K: 1).

Imbriani; Bologna/IT Purpose: Abdominal emergencies sometimes are a diagnostic challenge. CT is the imaging modality of choice in patients with uncertain US scan. Public awareness of ionizing radiation exposure has increased in recent years. The purpose of this study is to assess the role of a fast MRI protocol (about 10 minutes) using new technologies, as the first-line imaging method in abdominal emergencies and to show the radiological findings that allow the characterization of various pathologies seen in the emergency setting, particularly among a select patient population. Purpose: To identify preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced-MRI biomarkers for the prediction of early recurrence (2 years) after curative resection for liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) category 5 (LR-5) HCC. Material and methods: Between July 2015 and July 2018, this retrospective study evaluated consecutive treatment-na\u00efve high-risk patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR examination within 1 month before surgical resection for HCC. Tumor recurrence was determined by clinical and imaging follow-up. All MR images were reviewed by three independent radiologists regarding the LI-RADS v2018 imaging features, LI-RADS categories and several non-LI-RADS imaging features of all high-risk lesions. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the predictors for early recurrence after hepatectomy.",

The multivariate Cox hazards model revealed that corona enhancement (hazard ratio (HR), 2.180; p = 0.008), peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) (HR, 2.904; p = 0.000), multifocality (HR, 2.179; p = 0.003) and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level > 400 ng/mL (HR, 2.182; p = 0.003) were independent risk factors for early recurrence. Further, AUC of the obtained predictive model was approximately 0.80 for the combination of three imaging biomarkers with or without the integration of AFP. Conclusion: In high-risk patients with LR-5 HCC, preoperative HBP peritumoral hypointensity, corona enhancement, multifocality and serum AFP can be used to effectively predict early recurrence after curative hepatectomy. Material and methods: The radiology reports for all AMRIs performed through May 2019, at a single referral center, were retrospectively reviewed. Each AMRI examination was scored as negative (no or only definitely benign observations), subthreshold (observations <10 mm) or positive (observations \u2265 10 mm, not definitely benign). Each patient was categorized as surveillance-negative, surveillance-subthreshold or surveillance-positive according to their highest AMRI score they had during the inclusion period. Blinded to those categories, each patient was classified as positive or negative for HCC using a composite reference standard that integrated all available clinical, imaging and pathology data. Results: 1160 AMRIs were performed in 561 patients. 185 (33%) patients were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 376 patients, 295 (79%) were surveillancenegative, 23 (6%) surveillance-subthreshold, and 58 (15%) surveillance-positive. Based on the composite reference standard, 292/295 (99%) surveillance-negative and 20/23 (87%) surveillance-subthreshold patients were HCC-negative (true negatives); 29/58 (50%) of surveillance-positive patients were HCC-positive (true positives). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of surveillance AMRI were 86%, 91% and 90%, respectively. Conclusion: Hepatobiliary-phase AMRI surveillance is feasible clinically in patients in whom US surveillance is compromised. Our preliminary single-center experience suggests it provides higher sensitivity (86% vs 78%) and specificity (98% vs 89%) [4] with a lower loss to follow-up (33% vs 38%) [5] than historically reported US surveillance.

Song; Chengdu/CN Purpose: To prospectively determine whether the quantitative imaging parameters derived from hepatobiliary phase (HBP) can be used for the preoperative prediction of HCC with highly aggressive characteristics. Material and methods: 103 patients with surgically proven HCC were included from July 2015 to June 2018. Signal intensity (SI) of liver and tumor was measured by two independent reviewers and quantitative parameters including relative tumor enhancement (RTE), tumor to liver contrast ratio (TLR), tumor enhancement index (TEI) and relative enhancement ratio (RER) were calculated. The aggressive characteristics of HCC were identified using Ki-67 labeling index (LI) and patients were classified into low-aggressive (Ki-67 LI \u2264 10%) and high-aggressive (Ki-67 LI > 10%) groups. Difference of quantitative parameters between two groups were assessed, and the correlation was explored. ROC analyses were used to evaluate the predictive performance of quantitative parameters. Results: RTE, TLR, TEI and RER were significantly lower in the high-aggressive group than the low-aggressive group (p < 0.05) and negative correlations were obtained between these quantitative parameters and Ki-67 LI (r ranges from -0.41 to -0.22, p < 0.05).

Ba-Ssalamah; Vienna/AT Purpose: To explore whether sarcopenia, diagnosed by an abbreviated MRI protocol is a risk factor for hepatic decompensation and mortality in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Material and methods: In this retrospective single-centre study, we included 265 patients (164 men, mean age 54 \u00b116 years) with CLD who had undergone MRI of the liver between 2010 and 2015. Transverse psoas muscle thickness (TPMT) was measured on unenhanced and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted axial images. Sarcopenia was defined by height-adjusted and gender-specific cut-offs in women as TPMT <8mm/m and in men as TPMT <12mm/m, respectively. Patients were further stratified into three prognostic stages according to the absence of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4<1.45, non-advanced CLD), compensated-advanced CLD (cACLD); and decompensatedadvanced CLD (dACLD Takatsuki/JP Purpose: An important negative prognostic factor for adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and periampullary region is the presence of para-aortic lymph node (LN) metastases, which are regarded as distant metastases. Determining LN status is challenging but may be possible with MRI with ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles, which have proven valuable for detecting LN metastases of solid tumors. The aim is to validate USPIO-MRI for pathology in patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer. Material and methods: Analysis of an ongoing feasibility study in patients undergoing resection of pancreatic or periampullary adenocarcinoma (N=14). LNs are scored on MRI, divided between regional and distant, and matched to histopathology of resected specimens. Results: One patient was excluded due to perioperative peritoneal metastases. In the remaining 13 patients, in total 307 LNs were detected on MRI. In total, 293 LNs were analyzed histopathologically. On MRI, 28/78 regional and 58/229 distant LNs were suspected for metastases. On histopathology, 35/260 regional and 3/33 distant LNs were positive for metastases. Not all suspected distant LNs were resected. The regional LNs were assessed on a per-patient basis. Five patients had suspicious LNs with positive LNs histopathologically, 4 patients had negative LNs on MRI, but positive LNs histopathologically and 4 patients had negative LNs on MRI with negative LNs histopathologically.",

In light of the large proportion of misdiagnosed HCA, LCE-MRI should be performed to prevent unnecessary anxiety in women with a benign liver lesion. Material and methods: Thirty-four patients (31 women (91%), median age 43.5 years ) with 45 pathologically proven and subtyped HCAs (including 29 inflammatory HCAs (I-HCA) and 15 HNF1-\u03b1-inactivated HCAs (H-HCA)) who underwent CEUS were included. The features of HCA on B-mode and CEUS were independently reviewed by two radiologists and compared between HCA subtypes. Results: I-HCAs were either hypoechoic (23/29, 79%) or isoechoic (4/29, 14%) with B-mode and 12 (41.4%) were heterogeneous. All H-HCAs except one demonstrated homogeneous hyperechogenicity (93%) (p=0.001). Moderate or marked liver steatosis was only observed in I-HCAs (12/29, 41%) (p=0.001). Arterial hyperenhancement was observed on CEUS in 27/29 (93%) I-HCAs and in 14/15 (93%) H-HCAs (p=0.98). Washout was present in 6/29 (21%) I-HCAs and 1/15 (7%) H-HCAs (p=0.27). A total of 23/29 (79%) I-HCAs and 15/15 (100%) HCAs were homogeneous on portal and delayed phase acquisitions (p=0.04). The positive predictive value for identifying an H-HCA was 100% when the lesion was homogeneous and hyperechoic on B-mode, and the negative predictive value was 100% if neither of these two features was present in a liver with obvious steatosis. Conclusion: Most CEUS features, especially enhancement patterns, do not significantly differ between HCAs. CEUS does not seem to provide additional information from B-mode US. The combination of B-mode lesion hyperechogenicity, homogeneity and the absence of obvious liver steatosis is useful to distinguish H-HCAs from I-HCAs.",

Interobserver agreement was checked, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used for screening the risk factors. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves analyses were performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance.",

Yoo; Seoul/KR Purpose: A recent study showed that serum tumor marker-based MoRAL score (11\u00d7\u221a[PIVKA-II] + 2\u00d7\u221a[AFP]) can reflect the aggressiveness of HCCin explant liver. The present study aimed to evaluate whether baseline MoRAL score could predict tumor recurrence after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for very early/ early-stage HCC. Material and methods: A total of 576 HCC patients who underwent RFA as initial treatment were enrolled from two tertiary-referral hospitals (256 patients in the development cohort and 320 patients in the validation cohort). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS) and the secondary endpoints included cumulative risks of intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR) and extrahepatic metastasis (EM). Results: In development cohort, MoRAL score was an independent prognostic factor of RFS (p=0.02). The optimal cutoff-MoRAL score for predicting RFS was 68. Patients with high MoRAL score (>68) showed significantly shorter RFS than did those with low MoRAL score (hazard ratio [HR]=2.09, p<0.001). The five-year RFS rates were 32.3% and 53.2% in high-and low-MoRAL groups, respectively. To determine whether texture features on pretreatment contrast material-enhanced CT images can predict treatment response to trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with HCC. Material and methods: 97 patients with HCC treated with TACE, between September 2012 and August 2018, were retrospectively evaluated. Inclusion criteria for this study were available pretreatment laboratory exams and clinical data, pre-treatment CT performed in our hospital, absence of portal vein thrombosis and available post-treatment CT at 1-6 months from the procedure with no other pharmacological or interventional intercorring treatments. 41 pts met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. CT texture analysis was performed on pretreatment portal venous images and CT texture first-level features at different anatomic scales, ranging from fine to coarse texture, were analyzed. Post-treatment CT images were evaluated using modified RECIST criteria. A univariate analysis was performed via an appropriate test (Chi2, Mann-Whitney U, two-tailed paired T test) to identify those variables which differed significantly (p<0.05) in the two populations of complete responders and partial/non-responders. Optimal cut-off values were defined using ROC curves. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 24. Results: Standard deviation, entropy, mpp, skewness and kurtosis variables resulted statistically significant between the two groups. A prediction model for complete response, using multivariate logistic regression with forward stepwise selection, was efficiently developed (AUC=0.702; p<0.001).",

Purpose: It has previously been shown that CT scans performed for other indications can be used to identify patients with osteoporosis. This has not yet been tested in a British population. We sought to evaluate the use of vertebral CT attenuation measures for predicting osteoporosis in a British cohort, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as a reference standard. Material and methods: Patients who underwent abdominal CT in 2018, and concomitantly underwent DEXA within a six-month interval, were retrospectively included. CT attenuation values in Hounsfield units (HU) were measured on the sagittal reconstruction by the placement of a region-of-interest at the central portion of the L1 vertebral body, and then compared to their corresponding DEXA score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model, and to determine sensitivity and specificity thresholds. Results: 536 patients (394 females, mean age 65.8) were included, of which 174 had DEXA-defined osteoporosis. L1 attenuation measures were significantly different (p<0.01) between the three DEXA-defined groups of osteoporosis (118HU), osteopenia (143HU) and normal bone density (178HU). The area under the ROC curve was 0.74 (95% CI 0.69 -0.78). A threshold of 169HU was 90% sensitive and a threshold of 104HU was 90% specific for diagnosing osteoporosis.",

Material and methods: From 08/2017 to 08/2018, prospectively acquired data of 130 patients who were divided into two study parts were analyzed. Two readers independently assessed the hepatic arterial display on a four-point scale. The kappa test was used to determine the interobserver agreement.

For study part II, comparable image quality for the arterial display of CHA (p=0.798), PHA (p=0.935), LHA (p=0.122), RHA (p=0.809), LGA (p=0.710) and GDA (p=0.659) was obtained with DISCO and CTA. Conclusion: In conclusion, the use of MAP acquisition with DISCO is superior to the use of SAP in hepatic arterial display and compares favorably with CTA; in the future, DISCO possibly can replace the latter ionization-related method to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the liver lesions.

Conclusion: The majority of benign lesions showed homogeneous or peripheral hyperintensity on HBP while all HCCs showed homogeneous signal hypointensity. HBP images are helpful for the differentiation between benign lesions and HCCs and outperform other sequences.

There was a borderline significant effect of higher tumour SU-Vmean (HR=1.41, p=0.068) and higher background liver SUVmax (HR=2.04, p=0.069) on worse hPFS. At multivariate analysis, of the imaging-derived variables, a greater number of metastases, smaller metastases, and a higher tumour SUVmean (all p<0.05) were associated with worse DFS, and a greater number of metastases (p<0.001) was associated with worse hPFS. Conclusion: The number of metastases by imaging was consistently associated with poorer outcomes in patients",

Results: The diameter of the paraoesophageal veins was significantly higher in patients with upper GI bleeding (4 mm vs. 2.5 mm, p=0.02). Moreover, there was a significant association between the diameters of the paragastric veins and the presence of variceal hemorrhage (p=0.04).

Material and methods: 111 LARC who received nCRT and subsequent surgery were enrolled prospectively. They all underwent pre-and post-CRT rectal MRI with IVIM and DKI sequences. According to the pathological TRG and ypT stage, patients were grouped as complete responders (CR, TRG0) and non-complete responders (non-CR, TRG1-3), low-T stage (ypT0-2) and high-T stage (ypT3-4) groups. ROIs were manually drawn on three largest slices of tumor on b value of 800s/mm2 imaging. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), IVIM parameters (D,D* and f) and DKI parameters (MD and MK) were calculated. Results: The CR group had higher post-CRT MD (P=0.005) and ADC value (P=0.018), and higher absolute change of f (P=0.017), MD (P=0.018), and ADC value (P=0.018) after nCRT than non-CR group. Post-CRT MD (AUC=0.718) had a similar performance in selecting CR to ADC (AUC=0.698, P=0.930). The absolute change of f (AUC=0.747, specificity=85.7%) and MD (AUC=0.767, specificity=85.7%) had higher specificities than ADC (AUC=0.743, specific-ity=71.4%), with comparable overall diagnostic power. After nCRT, the low-T stage group had higher post-CRT D (P=0.01), f (P=0.042), MD (P=0.003), and ADC value (P<0.001) than high-T stage group. These four parameters yielded respective AUCs of 0.693, 0.641, 0.723, and 0.723 in assessing ypT stage after nCRT in LARC. Conclusion: IVIM and DKI could help to assess tumor regression grade and T stage after nCRT in patients with LARC.",

Hur; Seoul/KR Purpose: To investigate the impact of recently updated 2019 5th World Health Organization (WHO) classification of primary liver cancers on the performance of liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) v2018 for combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) in differentiating from HCC at gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI). Material and methods: In this retrospective study, 209 patients with surgically proven cHCC-CCAs (according to the 4th WHO classification) who had undergone preoperative Gd-EOB-MRI between 2009 and 2018 were included. A retrospective review of all surgical specimens and histopathologic rediagnosis was performed by a pathologist according to the recently updated 5th WHO classification. LI-RADS category was assigned for each lesion by five abdominal radiologists in consensus. LI-RADS categories were compared across cHCC-CCA, HCC, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) using a \u03a72 test. Results: 15.3% (32/209) of previously diagnosed cHCC-CCAs were rediagnosed as HCCs according to the 5th WHO classification, and those HCCs were categorized as LR-5, LR-M, and LR-TIV in 53.1% (17/32), 37.5% (12/32), and 9.4% (3/32), respectively. 6.2% (13/209) of tumors were rediagnosed as IHCCs, and categorized as LR-M and LR-4 in 92.3% (12/13) and 7.7% (1/13). No IHCCs were categorized as LR-5. The remained 78.5% (164/209) was rediagnosed as cHCC-CCAs, and categorized as LR-5/4, LR-M, and LR-TIV in 47% (77/164), 43.9% (72/164), and 9.1% (15/164), respectively (P=0.005). Conclusion: Although approximately 20% of cHCC-CCAs were rediagnosed as HCCs or IHCCs according to the recently updated 5th WHO classification of primary liver cancer, a substantial proportion of cHCC-CCAs can be categorized as non-LR-M, making it difficult to differentiate from HCC.

Exclusion criteria: previous treatment, known neoplasia, PET/MRI contraindications, failure to consent and unavailable images. Images were reviewed in consensus by radiologist with 10years of experience in reading MRI and nuclear medicine physician with 3years of experience in reading PET. Assessment included a) MRI-identified Texture parameters are significantly different between mutant and wild-type patients; texture analysis, providing a quantitative assessment of tumor microenvironment, may represent a non-invasive tool in the early prediction of KRAS mutation status in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, allowing to customize treatment according to the predicted outcome.Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of dedicated rectal CT compared with high-resolution rectal MRI and histopathology in assessing rectal cancer. Material and methods: Sixty-seven rectal cancer patients, who underwent dedicated rectal CT with rectal distension using 80-100ml of sonographic gel and high-resolution MRI within a month, were enrolled. For rectal CT, axial, coronal, and sagittal images were acquired with 3-mm reconstruction interval. For CT and MRI, the following items were analyzed by an experienced gastrointestinal radiologist: distance from anal verge and anorectal junction, shortest CT and MRI agree in the evaluation of tumor size (p<0.01), with a mean discrepancy of 15%. Tumor dimension in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was correlated to the CT lesion diameter with a variation within 15%. Concordance in the assessment of vessel involvement and retroperitoneal infiltration was good (p<0.01), higher for the more experienced radiologist. In the evaluation of hepatic metastases, there was 94% concordance, with differences between the two radiologists (k=0.59, p<0.01). CT and MRI reported good correlation in the assessment of lymphadenopathies at expert's evaluation. An excellent correlation was observed between the two methods in the evaluation of healthy pancreatic parenchyma (p<0.01). Concordance values between CT and MRI were generally higher for the more experienced radiologist. Conclusion: In PDAC staging, the pancreatic expert radiologist can use CT and MRI alternately, while a less skilled radiologist may prefer their parallel use.Prediction of survival in pancreas cancer patients who underwent surgery after neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX therapy using CT and histopathological findings S.J. Park, J.H. Kim, I. Joo; Seoul/KR Purpose: To investigate important factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in pancreas cancer with neoadjuvant therapy. Material and methods: 69 patients with pancreas cancer underwent FOL-FIRINOX therapy before surgery were retrospectively included. All patients performed baseline and follow-up CT. Two reviewers assessed CT findings. Mgrad assessment based on MDCT results is more effective than only MDCT for PC diagnosis in patients with CP. Mgrad value positively correlates with PC existence; therefore, it could be useful for PC diagnosis. Material and methods: Sixteen subjects were included with PDAC detected during an observation period from January 2012 until March 2019 out of 218 mutation carriers enrolled in the program since 2000. MRI at 3.0T included T2-weighted, fat-suppressed T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), MRCP and T1-TFE sequences. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was added in 2015. Two readers independently analysed the current and past MRI examinations for lesions and other findings. Results: Fourteen of 16 PDAC were seen on T1-TFE and T1-DCE by both readers. Thirteen tumors demonstrated increased enhancement in the delayed phase of T1-DCE. Dilatation of the pancreatic duct was present in 5 subjects.",

Schurink, J. van Griethuysen, L.A. Min, R.G.H. Beets-Tan, S. van Kranen, D.M.J. Lambregts; Amsterdam/NL Purpose:Although several studies have investigated the reproducibility of radiomics data derived from CT and PET/CT, data on the reproducibility of MRbased radiomics are scarce. This study assesses the reproducibility of radiomic features from pelvic MRI data and investigates the effects of variations between readers, segmentation methodology and software packages. Material and methods: 25 pelvic MRIs (T2W-MRI of anal cancer) were retrospectively analyzed and segmented by two readers to include the[1] wholetumour volume, and [2] largest single axial tumour slice. Pixel intensities were normalized to mean=300/SD=100, and images were resampled isotropically (2x2x2mm3). Radiomic features were extracted using 2 open-source packages (PyRadiomics-v2.2.0, CaPTk-v1.7.3), using comparable settings without image filtration. A fixed histogram bin of 5 was used. Only features defined in both packages were extracted (first-order, shape, GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM and NGTDM features, 51 total). For each feature, the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated between the [1] two readers, [2] two segmentation methods (whole-volume vs. single-slice) and [3] two software packages. 75<ICC<=0.9) to excellent (2/15; ICC>0.9) reproducibility. Between software packages, most first-order, shape, GLCM and GLRLM features showed excellent reproducibility (23/30; ICC>0.9). The remaining higher order features (GLSZM, NGTDM) were all poorly reproducible (21/21; ICC<0.5). Conclusion: Variations in software and segmentation methodology negatively affected measurement reproducibility in MRI-based radiomics, especially higher order features. Inter-reader reproducibility was moderate-to-good.",

Material and methods: In an IRB-approved, retrospective study, all CT chest/ abdomen/pelvis reports (July 2009 to April 2019) adhering to departmental structured template were included. The SPLEEN subsection was extracted and those with default 'unremarkable' text were excluded from training. For patients with colorectal cancers (CRC), hepatobiliary cancers (HB), leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-HL (NHL), 1920 of 105,042 reports were annotated as positive or negative/uncertain for splenomegaly. Model training was performed on 1536 and model accuracy was tested on 384 reports. The prediction model was then applied to the remaining reports to calculate frequencies of splenomegaly. Results: In the annotated reports, splenomegaly was present in 42.2%. After training, the splenomegaly classifier achieved 94% overall accuracy, 94.6% precision (positive predictive value) and 94% recall (sensitivity). When the model was applied to all unannotated reports, the predicted frequency of spleno-NLP can predict splenomegaly from structured radiology reports after training from a limited sample of annotated text. At our institution, the frequency of splenomegaly in CRC patients was similar to HL and NHL patients, and lower than both patients with HB cancers and leukemia.

Van Rijn 1 , E.M. van Praag 1 , M. Monraats 2 , C. Buskens 1 , J. Stoker 1 ; 1 Amsterdam/NL, 2 Delft/NL Purpose: Surgical closure of high perianal fistulas using ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure is increasingly used in Crohn's disease. Currently, data on postoperative MRI findings are lacking, while important to assess deep healing. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate fistula characteristics on MRI and the relation with clinical outcomes after LIFT procedure. Material and methods: Consecutive Crohn's patients treated with LIFT between 2007 and 2018 for high perianal fistulas who underwent baseline and follow-up MRI were retrospectively included. MRIs were scored by two radiologists according to items based on the original and modified Van Assche indices. MRI findings and the relation towards clinical healing were described. At this time, eight patients (67%) showed clinical healing, which increased to ten (83%) during follow-up, none had a recurrence. Three patients (25%) needed a re-intervention due to inflammatory masses and/or persisting fistulas. At baseline, all patients showed a tract predominantly filled with granulation tissue, which changed to fibrotic in seven (58%). All clinically responding patients showed a decrease in tract volume and/or hyperintensity with the absence of hyperintensity (T1 and T2) in four (33%) patients. Conclusion: Clearly decreased fistula activity can be observed on MRI after LIFT surgery in Crohn's patients. A large proportion of patients develops a fibrotic tract relatively soon after LIFT and shows no clinical recurrences, suggesting a highly effective therapy and prognostic value of MRI.MR enterography before treatment may predict response to tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors in Crohn's disease J. Rimola 1 , N. Capozzi 2 , A. Fernandez-Clotet 1 , J. Castro-Poceiro 1 , I. Ord\u00e1s 1 , J. Panes 1 ; 1 Barcelona/ES, Purpose: Identifying predictors of therapeutic response is the cornerstone of personalized medicine. We aimed to identify predictors of long-term healing of severe inflammatory lesions detected at MR enterography (MRE) in patients with Crohn's disease treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors. Material and methods: Prospective longitudinal single-center study including patients with clinically active Crohn's disease requiring treatment with TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors with at least one intestinal segment with a severe inflammatory lesion detected by MRE (segmental MaRIA \u2265 11). MRE data were obtained at baseline, week-14, and week-46. The primary endpoint was the healing of severe inflammatory lesions (MaRIA < 11) in each segment.The secondary endpoint was healing of all severe inflammatory lesions in all intestinal segments. Results: We included 58 patients with 86 intestinal segments with severe inflammatory lesions. At week-46, healing of severe lesions was found in 51 (59.3%) segments, and complete healing of inflammatory all lesions in all segments was found in 28 (48.6%) patients. Multivariate analysis found predictors of healing colonic location (as opposed to ileal) (OR 4.5 [1.2-17.2]; p=0.024) and lack of creeping fat at MRE (OR 4.3 [1.7-17.6]; p=0.04). Healing on MRE at week-14 is an independent predictor of sustained healing at week-46 (OR 11 [2.1-57.1]; p=0.004). Conclusion: In patients with Crohn's disease, the absence of creeping fat detected at pretreatment MRE and location of severe inflammatory lesions are clinically relevant predictors of long-term healing of severe inflammation after treatment with TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors.Diffusion-weighted MR enterography: quantitative analysis segmental apparent diffusion coefficient values in normal and abnormal bowel segments in patients with Crohn's disease J.

Material and methods: We performed a retrospective-prospective study in which standardized MR enterography evaluation was used on 50 patients with histopathology-confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease who had either symptomatic disease or were monitoring disease activity during treatment. MR enterography included DWI (b =1400 sec/mm\u00b2). For each of the seven bowel segments (jejunum, proximal ileum, distal and terminal ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon and sigmoid colon and rectum) per patient (n=350), we quantitative analysed segmental normal and pathological ADC values and statistically analysed differences between them. We used MaRIA score as the reference standard. Results: The mean ADC value for normal 265 segments was 1.95x10-\u00b3mm\u00b2/s and for 85 abnormal segments it was 1.14x10-\u00b3 mm\u00b2/s. There were significant differences in segmental ADC values between normal segments: the highest normal ADC values were in segment 2 (2.03x10-\u00b3 mm\u00b2/s), the lowest in segment 7 (1.79x10-\u00b3 mm\u00b2/s). The lowest pathological ADC values were in segment 3 (1.07x10-\u00b3 mm\u00b2/s). The statistical differences between segmental ADC values were higher in normal than in abnormal segments (p<0.05). Conclusion: There were significant differences in segmental ADC values between normal and abnormal bowel segments. The ADC values are statistically highly significantly lower in abnormal bowel segments.Expert consensus on acquisition and reporting of intestinal US activity in Crohn's disease: a prospective inter-rater agreement study R.Wilkens 1 , K.

Novak 6 ; 1 Hvidovre/DK, 2 Bergen/NO, 3 Luneberg/DE, 4 Amsterdam/NL, Milan/IT, 6 Calgary, AB/CA, 7 Loures/PT, 8 Parkville, VIC/AU Purpose: Intestinal US (IUS) is a promising cross-sectional imaging modality used to assess transmural disease and complications in Crohn's disease (CD).Standard measurements, reproducibility and nomenclature have not yet been clearly established. The aim of this study was to evaluate inter-rater agreement for important parameters by experts through Delphi consensus. Material and methods: IUS parameters demonstrating inflammatory activity were selected by a blinded Delphi IUS experts consensus panel to establish relative contribution to inflammatory activity in CD. Phase 1: blind review by 8 readers of 20 de-identified CD cases. Cases with poor agreement were reviewed to clarify discrepancy and improve agreement. Phase 2: an additional 30 deidentified CD cases blindly were reviewed by 12 independent expert readers. Inter-rater agreement was evaluated for all 4 key parameters. Results: The Delphi process reduced 12 activity parameters to 4 key contributors including BWT, color Doppler signal (CDI), inflammatory fat and bowel wall echo stratification. BWT was comprised of 2 measurements in cross section and 2 in longitudinal orientation. Interobserver agreement was almost perfect This expert consensus-based IUS activity score clearly establishes the reproducibility of this standardized approach to measure inflammatory activity in CD. Using our method, BWT is highly reproducible with CDI and inflammatory fat demonstrating moderate reproducibility. This score may provide the foundation for the future incorporation of IUS in research studies and clinical trials.Feasibility and reliability of GI US in pregnant inflammatory bowel disease patients F.

Yu, B. Song; Chengdu/CN Purpose: To determine MDCT radiological features and texture features that can be used to predict the pathological grade of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (PNEN) pathological grade. Material and methods: Patients with pathologically proven PNEN were included. Preoperative CT images in the arterial phase (AP) and the portal vein phase (PVP) were obtained. Radiological features, including diameter, margin, location, hepatic metastasis, distal main pancreatic ductal dilation, pancreatic atrophy, calcification in tumor, vascular in tumor, ratio of tumor to pancreatic parenchyma in AP and PVP, were reviewed by two radiologists, independently. 3D regions of interest (ROIs) were used to extract texture features from AP and PVP images. A chi-squared test, Student's t test, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), kappa statistics, uni-and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze differences between low-and highgrade PNEN. Results: 163 PNENs were included. Diameter, margin, hepatic metastasis and ratio of tumor to pancreatic parenchyma in AP were significantly different between G1 and G2/3 PNEN. In multivariate analysis, diameter (odds ratio: 1.423) and ill-defined margin (odds ratio: 3.176) were independent significant predictors for G2/3 PNEN. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the radiological feature model, AP texture model, and PVP texture model, all established by logistic regression, were 0.780, 0.774, and 0.788, respectively. Conclusion: In conclusion, ill-defined margin and diameter >3cm were shown to be helpful in predicting high-grade PNEN. Texture analysis (TA) of multi-phase MDCT images can be used as a beneficial tool in the preoperative prediction of PNEN pathological grade.Factors influencing the detection rate of transabdominal US for incidentally detected pancreatic cysts: a prospective multicentre study J.H. Kim, M.H. Yu, E.S. Lee, H.-J. Kang, H.J. Park, Y.S. Park; Seoul/KRPurpose: To investigate the detection rate of transabdominal US (TAUS) for incidentally detected pancreatic cysts on CT or MRI as well as factors influencing detection rates. Material and methods: Fifty-seven patients with incidentally detected pancreatic cysts (n = 77, 5mm to 3cm) on CT or MRI were prospectively enrolled at five institutions. TAUS was performed independently by two radiologists and assessed the detection of cysts, their location and size, and the diameter of the main pancreatic duct (MPD). Cyst detection rates according to size, location, multiplicity, and body mass index (BMI) were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Kappa statistics and interclass correlation coefficient were used to evaluate the inter-observer agreement of cyst detection and consistency of size and diameter of MPD between TAUS and CT/MRI. Results: Detection rate of pancreatic cysts was 81.8 % (63/77) and 83.1% (64/77) for each radiologist. Detection rate of larger (\u226510mm) cysts was significantly higher than smaller cysts (89.0% vs 63.6% for R1; 89.0% vs 68.2% for R2, p< 0.05). Non tail location showed significantly higher detection rate than tail location (89.5% vs 65.0% for R2, p = 0.013) and detection rate was also significantly higher in single than in multiple cysts (90.9% vs 69.7 %, p = 0.018 for R1). However, BMI showed no significant difference. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for cyst size (0.963, 95% CI: 0.943-0.976) and diameter of MPD (0.930, 95% CI: 0.891-0.956). Conclusion: TAUS could be a useful surveillance imaging tool for incidentally detected pancreatic cysts on CT or MRI, especially, in single pancreatic cysts of larger (\u22651cm) size and non-tail location.MDCT scan with model-based reconstruction algorithm in the detection and characterization of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: comparison with MRCP D. Ippolito 1 , C. Maino 1 , A. Pecorelli 1 , M. Ragusi 1 , T. Giandola 1 , M. Porta 1 , C. Talei Franzesi 1 , S. Sironi 2 ; Monza/IT, 2 Milan/IT Purpose: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of low-kV MDCT reconstructed with model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm (IMR) to MRI with MRCP sequences in the detection of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and those features useful for their characterization. Material and methods: We evaluated a total of 90 patients, with no history of pancreatitis, neoplasm and prior surgical procedures in the pancreas, who underwent both low-dose MDCT reconstructed with IMR and MRCP (time interval lower 90 days) for incidental pancreatic cystic lesions. Number of lesions detected in each patient and morphologic features (according to 2018 European Guidelines) of defined target lesion were recorded and analyzed to compare the diagnostic performance of MDCT with IMR algorithm and MRCP. Results: A higher number of pancreatic cysts was identified on MRI than CT examinations (463 vs 227); however, high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value of 0.76 was found, suggesting a good agreement. Very good agreement (ICC 0.98) was found regarding the diameter of target lesions (21.4 mm CT vs 21.8 mm MRI), location of the target lesion (\u03ba=0.90), detection of MPD dilatation (\u03ba=1.00), MPD communication (\u03ba=0.73) and septa (\u03ba=0.86). Fair agreement with calcifications (\u03ba=0.22) was found. Conclusion: Low-dose MDCT reconstructed with IMR can be considered equivalent to MRI with MRCP in the evaluation of IPMN, offering detailed morphologic features helpful for their characterization and those correlated with a high risk of malignancy. Role of MDCT in the assessment of acute pancreatitis and severity grading based on modified CT severity index and its correlation with severity grading as per revised Atlanta classification 2012 and clinical outcome S. Ps; New Delhi/IN Purpose: To study the role of MDCT in the assessment of the severity of acute pancreatitis using modified CT scoring system and correlate the MDCT scoring with clinical severity of the disease and patient outcome. Material and methods: It was a cross-sectional observational study of 152 patients conducted in the Department of Radiodiagnosis at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Severity grading of acute pancreatitis was assessed based on modified CT severity index (MCTSI). Clinical severity of acute pancreatitis was evaluated based on revised Atlanta classification (RAC) 2012. Clinical outcomes of patients were noted in terms of duration of hospital admission, ICU stay, evidence of organ failure, evidence of infection, the need for intervention and death.Results: The study group included 152 cases of acute pancreatitis: according to MCTSI, 25 mild, 49 moderate and 78 severe cases; clinically, 27 mild, 76 moderately severe and 49 severe cases based on RAC. MCTSI showed good concordance with RAC grading in 23 (84.18%) mild, 40 (52.6%) moderate and 44 (89.7%) severe cases. Around 43.5% (34/78 cases) clinical moderately severe cases were overestimated by MCTSI as severe cases because of 2 extra points from extrapancreatic complication mainly due to mild pleural effusion and ascites even in the absence of organ failure. MCTSI showed significant statistical correlation (p <0.001) with outcome parameters except for evidence of infection and death. Conclusion: The present study MCTSI showed good concordance with clinical severity grading (RAC). MCTSI grading of acute pancreatitis is helpful for clinicians for prognostication and decision-making in the duration of hospital stay, need for ICU care, intervention and follow-up.Preoperative CT evaluation for the prediction of acute pancreatitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy A. Fighera, M. Chincarini, G.A. Zamboni, G. Mansueto; Verona/IT Purpose: To investigate CT risk factors for postoperative acute pancreatitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative multiphasic CT scans of 19 patients with clinically confirmed postoperative acute pancreatitis (14 after pancreaticoduodenectomy and 5 after distal pancreatectomy) and 19 CT scans of patients who did not show acute pancreatitis after surgery (13 after pancreaticoduodenectomy and 6 after distal pancreatectomy). Scans were reviewed by two readers in consensus, measuring pancreatic duct size and parenchymal thickness of the portion of the pancreas which would be the pancreatic remnant after surgery. An ROI was placed in basal and arterial phases in the same portion of the pancreas to measure basal density and arterial enhancement at the level of the future remnant. Results: Pancreatic duct size was significantly smaller in patients who did manifest postoperative acute pancreatitis, with a mean value of 2.1\u00b10.3 mm vs 5.6\u00b10.9 mm (p value<0.05). Pancreatic parenchymal thickness was higher in patients with postoperative pancreatitis: mean value 15.9\u00b10.7 mm vs 10.9\u00b11.1 mm, (p value<0.05). In patients with postoperative pancreatitis, we also noticed a significantly higher basal density with a mean value of 40.9\u00b11.7 HU vs 32.7\u00b12.4 HU (p value<0.05). Difference of enhancement between arterial and basal phases was not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Smaller main pancreatic duct size, higher parenchymal thickness and higher basal parenchymal density at the level of the future remnant pancreas are indexes of major pancreatic tropism. In consequence, they are risk factors for developing acute pancreatitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy.Risk assessment for postoperative pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy on preoperative CT A. Grecchi 1 , R. Menghini 1 , G.A. Zamboni 1 , A.J. Cibulsky 1 , M. Gasparetto 1 , M.-P. Vullierme 2 , G. Marchegiani 1 , G. Mansueto 1 ; 1 Verona/IT, 2 Clichy/FR Purpose: To assess the value of preoperative CT features for predicting clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF).Material and methods: This multicenter retrospective study included 88 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy in two centers. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to clinical data: 44 patients with POPF and 44 patients without POPF. In each center, one reader (\u226510 years experience) reviewed the preoperative MDCTs of the patients, measuring at the planned resection plane the main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter, the parenchymal density in the different phases and the parenchymal thickness. HUven-HUart was calculated, and progressive enhancement was interpreted as a sign of fibrosis. Body composition was analysed by calculating visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and skeletal muscle area at the L2 level (ImageJ software). Retrorenal fat thickness and psoas density were measured. Fisher's test and Mann-Whitney test were used as appropriate. Results: MPD diameter was 2.7\u00b12.6mm in the fistula group and 6.3\u00b13.1mm in the non-fistula group (P<0.0001). The mean attenuation difference between venous and arterial phases was 2.6HU in POPF group and -13.2HU in the non-POPF group (P=0.0010). VAT was 19164.2mm2 in the POPF group and 13263.5mm2 in the non-POPF group (P=0.002). SAT was 18018.6mm2 in POPF group and 12269.7mm2 in the non-POPF group (P=0.004). No difference was observed for other parameters. Conclusion: Fibrosis, expressed by increasing enhancement of the normal pancreatic parenchyma, MPD diameter and increased VAT and SAT may express increased risk for pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy.Inter-observer variability of radiologists for Cambridge Classification for Chronic Pancreatitis using CT and MRCP: results from a large multi-centre study T.

These subjects were categorized into three groups based on clinical data and review of imaging by local radiologist (LR) at the enrolling sites: controls (n = 8; CC of 0), suspected CP (n = 22; CC of 1 or 2) and definite CP (n = 9; CC = 3 or 4). Each study was scored by 3 radiologists, who were randomly selected from 5 blinded subspecialized radiologists. We compared the CC score by LRs and a consensus CC score by central radiologists (CRs). The weighted kappa statistic (wKappa) was used to estimate the inter-observer agreement. Results: There was moderate agreement (63% and 67%, respectively) between CRs and LRs in both CT score(wKappa [95% CI] = 0.56 [0.34, 0.78]; p-value = 0.57) and MR score (wKappa [95% CI] = 0.68 [0.49, 0.86]; p-value = 0.72). The composite CT/MRCP score showed moderate agreement (wKappa [95% CI] = 0.62 [0.43, 0.81]; p-value = 0.80).For majority of subjects, the actual cohort assignment by the LR agreed with consensus composite CT/MRCP score by the CRs, with concordance ranging from 75% to 89%. Conclusion: There is a high degree of concordance by radiologists for the assignment of CC using MRCP and CT.Ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MRI for pre-operative lymph node staging in patients with pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma: a feasibility study G.

Kovacevic, Belgrade/RS Purpose: To evaluate the utility of ampullary MDCT in the non-invasive, preoperative differentiation of duodenal carcinoma and intestinal-type ampullary carcinoma. Material and methods: In this retrospective study, 20[8 females (age 38- 77 years)] patients with resected ampullary adenocarcinoma and duodenal adenocarcinoma who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced ampullary MDCT were included. Two radiologists, blinded to the pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma subtype, evaluated the presence of five MDCT features in consensus. Correlation between MDCT findings with ampullary cancer subtypes was performed using \u03c72 and Fisher's exact test. Results: When evaluated with ampullary MDCT, intestinal-type ampullary adenocarcinomas were significantly different in terms of lesion morphology 50%]). Intestinal-type ampullary carcinomas were significantly more frequently nodular in shape (10/10 [100%]), had a bulging papilla (9/10 [90%]), and \"free\" duodenopancreatic groove appearance (10/10[100]). Conclusion: A tailored ampullary MDCT protocol can be useful to differentiate intestinal adenocarcinoma from duodenal adenocarcinoma preoperatively.Focal liver tumours: diagnosis and interventionSS 13.1 Growth of hepatocellular adenoma during pregnancy: a prospective study M.G.

Gr\u00e9gory 1 , V. Vilgrain 1 , I. Boutron 2 , M. Ronot 1 ; 1 Clichy/FR,Paris/FRPurpose: To evaluate to what extent the results of registered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of HCC are publicly available. Material and methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and primary registries for RCTs assessing TACE for the treatment of HCC, registered between January 2008 and August 2018, that had exceeded their completion date by more than one year. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar for a publication as well as the registry for results. The main outcomes were the availability of results, and the time to the first availability of results (i.e., posted on the registry or published). Secondary outcomes were the proportion of results publicly available at 12, 24 and 36 months after completion. Results: Among 68 identified RCTs(11,751 participants), 26 had publicly available results (38%, i.e. 42% of participants). Results of 25 RCTs (37%) were published, with only three with results posted on the registry, and two with both published and posted results. The median (Q1-Q3) time from completion to the first public availability of results was 19 months (12-35). The cumulative percentage of RCTs with results available, either posted on the registry or published, was 10% (95% CI, 3% to 17%) at 12 months after completion of the RCTs, and 29% (95% CI, 17% to 39%) at 36 months. Conclusion: Despite the ethical commitments and societal expectations for disclosure of results, the availability of results of RCTs on TACE for HCC is very limited.Prediction of response to trans-arterial chemoembolisation in HCC using a model based on pretreatment CT texture features M.A. Tipaldi, E.
