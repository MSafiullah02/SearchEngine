Apart from relatively common vasculitides such as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein Purpura (HSP) and Kawasaki disease (KD), most of the primary vasculitic syndromes are rare in childhood, but when present are associated with signi fi cant morbidity and mortality [ 2, 3 ] . The cause of the majority of childhood vasculitides is unknown, although it is likely that a complex interaction between environmental factors, such as infections and inherited host responses, triggers the disease and determines the vasculitis phenotype [ 4 ] . This chapter summarizes the fi ndings of recent studies relating to the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitis, and considers HSP, KD, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs)-associated vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa and Takayasu arteritis (TA).

Several agents have been implicated, including group A streptococci, varicella, hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, Mycoplasma , Campylobacter , and Yersinia [ 4 ] . Of note, Masuda et al. showed that nephritis-associated plasmin receptor (NAPlr), a group A streptococcal antigen, may have a pathogenetic role in a subset of patients with HSP nephritis [ 10 ] . Among 33 children with biopsy proven HSP nephritis, 30% had segmental or global mesangial deposition of NAPlr antigen, comparing to 3% in other children with non-HSP nephritis glomerular diseases (half of these children had IgA nephropathy) [ 10 ] . The exact pathophysiologic mechanism, if any, and the relationship between NAPlr and HSP nephritis need, however, further investigation. So far no single infectious agent has been consistently identi fi ed, and it is likely that genetically controlled host responses determine whether or not an individual develops HSP in response to infectious triggers. But despite the fact that the cause of HSP is unknown, it is likely that IgA has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease, a hypothesis supported by the almost universal deposition of IgA in lesional vascular tissue [ 11 ] . Skin or renal biopsies demonstrate the deposition of IgA (mainly IgA1) in the wall of dermal capillaries and post-capillary venules and mesangium [ 11 ] . In addition, serum IgA levels have been reported to be increased during the acute phase of the disease, and a proportion of patients have circulating IgA-containing immune complexes and cryoglobulins [ 12 ] . Some studies have found IgA antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (IgA-ANCAs) in a proportion of patients with HSP, while others have shown an increase in IgA-rheumatoid factor or IgA-anticardiolipin antibodies [ 11 ] . Recently, galactose de fi ciency of O-linked glycans in the hinge region of IgA1 has been reported in adults with IgA nephropathy and children with HSP [ 13 ] . These aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 proteins form immune complexes that deposit in the mesangium; their binding to mesangial cells stimulates cellular proliferation and overexpression of extracellular matrix components resulting in the typical renal lesions associated with HSP [ 13 ] . Recently, Hiasano et al. showed complement activation through both the alternative and lectin pathways in patients with HSP nephritis and demonstrated that this complement activation is promoted in situ in the glomerulus [ 14 ] . The formed IgA immune complexes, through the activation of complement, lead to the formation of chemotactic factors (such as C5a), which in turn recruit polymorphonuclear leucocytes to the site of deposition [ 15, 16 ] . The polymorphonuclear leucocytes thus recruited by chemotactic factors cause in fl ammation and necrosis of vessel walls with concomitant thrombosis [ 11 ] . This subsequently results in extravasation of erythrocytes from haemorrhage in the affected organs and is manifested histologically as leucocytoclastic vasculitis [ 11 ] . The term leucocytoclasis refers to the breakdown of white blood cells in lesional tissue, particularly the characteristic nuclear debris (\"nuclear dust\") observed, and is not speci fi c for HSP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 110, "text": "[ 4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 111, "end": 114, "text": "9 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 288, "end": 293, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 305, "end": 318, "text": "Masuda et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 483, "end": 489, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 733, "end": 739, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1328, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1483, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1692, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1906, "end": 1912, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2067, "end": 2073, "text": "[ 13 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2353, "end": 2359, "text": "[ 13 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2583, "end": 2589, "text": "[ 14 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2800, "end": 2805, "text": "[ 15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2806, "end": 2810, "text": "16 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2962, "end": 2968, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3134, "end": 3140, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogenesis"}, {"text": "Several genetic polymorphisms have been linked with HSP in various population cohorts, often with consistent results across multiple studies (summarized in Table 2 .1 ) [ 32 ] . Many of these polymorphisms relate to cytokines or cell adhesion molecules involved in the modulation of in fl ammatory responses and endothelial cell activation [ 4, 32 ] . The connection between HSP and HLA alleles is the most convincing genetic association. In three cohorts from Italy, northwest Spain and Turkey, DRB1*01 and DRB*11 have each been positively associated (OR 1.5-2.5), and DRB*07 negatively associated, with HSP in two of the three studies [ 17, 18, 33 ] . HLAB35 was associated with HSP in a Turkish cohort [ 19 ] , but was only associated with nephritis in a Spanish cohort [ 20 ] . Null alleles in either of the complement factor C4 genes (C4A or C4B) have shown associations with HSP in multiple cohorts of different ethnicities [ 29 ] , but different fi ndings regarding associations with C4A or C4B alleles, association with heterozygosity or only homozygosity for a null allele, and close linkage of the C4 genes to HLA have resulted in debate about the signi fi cance of these fi ndings. Polymorphisms in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene have been associated with risk of HSP in two cohorts (OR 2.3-2.7) [ 24, 25 ] ; several additional studies have focused on association of ACE alleles with risk of nephritis but without consistent fi ndings.

Chartapisak et al. recently systematically reviewed all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the prevention or treatment of renal involvement in HSP [ 37 ] .

That said, there could still be a role for early use of corticosteroids in patients with severe extrarenal symptoms such as abdominal pain and arthralgia, as suggested by the fi ndings of a study performed by Ronkainen et al. [ 36 ] . Prednisone (1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, with weaning over the subsequent 2 weeks) was effective in reducing the intensity of abdominal pain and joint pain [ 36 ] . Prednisone did not prevent the development of renal symptoms but was effective in treating them if present; renal symptoms resolved in 61% of the prednisone patients after treatment, compared with 34% of the placebo patients [ 36 ] . Of note, Nikibakhsh et al. reported recently on the successful treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) of recurrent skin, articular and gastrointestinal symptoms in children with who failed to respond to systemic steroid therapy [ 39 ] . For patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescentic change on biopsy, uncontrolled data suggest that treatment may comprise aggressive therapy with corticosteroid, cyclophosphamide and possibly plasma exchange [ 34 ] , as with other causes of crescentic nephritis. Other therapies such as cyclosporin, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide have been reported to be effective [40] [41] [42] . As HSP is the most common cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in childhood, more aggressive therapeutic approaches such as plasma exchange have been employed in some cases [ 43 ] . These treatment options, while important in select cases, are not yet supported by RCTs. In addition, there are no robust clinical trials to guide therapy for HSP nephritis that is not rapidly progressive (patients may exhibit less than 50% crescents on renal biopsy, sub-optimal GFR; heavy proteinuria which is not necessarily nephrotic range) [ 34 ] .

Pronounced seasonality and clustering of KD cases have led to the hunt for infectious agents as a cause [ 55, 56 ] . However, so far no single agent has been identi fi ed, a fact most recently highlighted by the negative results that emerged from studies examining the potential link between coronavirus infection and KD in Taiwan [ 57 ] . One debate regarding the cause of KD has centred around the mechanism of immune activation: conventional antigen versus superantigen (SAg) [ 55, 58 ] . SAgs are a group of proteins that share the ability to stimulate a large proportion of T cells (up to 30% of the T-cell repertoire compared with one in a million T cells for conventional antigens) by binding to a portion of the T-cell receptor b chain (TCRV b ) in association with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules with no requirement for antigen processing [ 59 ] . SAgs have been identi fi ed in a variety of microorganisms, including many of the bacteria and viruses isolated from children with KD [ 55, 59, 60 ] . In 1992, Abe et al. were the fi rst to describe the selective expansion of V b 2 and V b 8.1T cells in KD [ 61 ] , indicating T-cell V b skewingthe hallmark of a SAg-mediated process. Since then, many similar studies have examined T cell V b repertoires in KD, or examined the prevalence of serological conversion or colonization with SAg-producing organisms [ 62, 63 ] . An SAg is also responsible for induction of coronary artery disease in a murine model of KD (discussed in detail in the \"In Vivo Experimental Data in KD\" section) [ 55, 59, 60 ] . However, Rowley et al. recently reported three fatal cases of KD and observed IgA plasma cell in fi ltration into the vascular wall during the acute phase of the illness [ 64 ] . By examining the clonality of this IgA response using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in lesional vascular tissue, these researchers observed that the IgA response was oligoclonal, suggesting a conventional Ag process rather than a SAgdriven one [ 64 ] . Although the debate continues regarding the mechanism of initial immune activation, different mechanisms are most likely involved with a fi nal common pathway of immune activation responsible for this clinical syndrome. Regardless of how T cells get activated, the massive immune response characteristic of KD is translated into systemic in fl ammation manifested clinically as fever and the cardiac features of KD [ 55 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 233, "end": 238, "text": "[ 55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 239, "end": 243, "text": "56 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 350, "end": 355, "text": "[ 55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 356, "end": 360, "text": "56 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 577, "end": 583, "text": "[ 57 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 725, "end": 730, "text": "[ 55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 731, "end": 735, "text": "58 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1131, "text": "[ 59 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1273, "text": "[ 55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1277, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1282, "text": "60 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1391, "end": 1397, "text": "[ 61 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1649, "text": "[ 62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1650, "end": 1654, "text": "63 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1820, "end": 1825, "text": "[ 55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1829, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1834, "text": "60 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2007, "end": 2013, "text": "[ 64 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2267, "text": "[ 64 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 2685, "end": 2691, "text": "[ 55 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogenesis"}, {"text": "Experimental mice develop coronary arteritis in response to intra-peritoneal injections of Lactobacillus casei wall extract (LCWE) with the resultant vasculitis being similar to KD in children [ 65, 66 ] . Young mice (age 4-5 weeks) are more susceptible to LCWE-induced disease compared with older mice [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] . The peripheral immune activation within hours of LCWE injection is followed by local in fi ltration into cardiac tissue at day 3 with the in fl ammatory in fi ltrate comprising mainly T cells [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] . This in fl ammatory response peaks at day 28 post injection and is accompanied by elastin breakdown with disruption of the intima and media, as well as aneurysm formation at day 42 [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] . Additionally, an SAg found within LCWE contributes signi fi cantly to the development of vascular disease [ 60 ] . The common features between this murine model and the human disease include an infectious trigger leading to immune activation; disease susceptibility in the young; a time course similar to that seen clinically in KD; similar pathology of coronary arteritis; and response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment [ 55 ] . The proposed disease model supported by the in vivo experimental data in this mouse model begins with immune activation by a microbe with superantigenic activity [ 55 ] . The SAg found in the LCWE preferentially expands T-lymphocytes expressing TCRV b 2, 4, 6 and 14 positive T cells, and this superantigenic activity is directly correlated with the ability to induce coronary arteritis in mice [ 60 ] . Ablation of IFN-g con fi rmed that IFN-g plays an important regulatory role in disease induction in this disease model [ 55 ] . Mice with absence of TNF-a activity (blockade of TNF-a ) or TNFR1 knockouts) do not develop coronary disease after LCWE stimulation [ 68 ] . Of note, the T cells found in affected vessels express SAg-reactive TCRV b families, an unexpected fi nding considering the usual fate of SAg-activated T cells, which are actively deleted by apoptosis. Moolani et al. have shown that co-stimulation can rescue SAg-stimulated T cells from apoptosis [ 70 ] . Furthermore, the coronary endothelium is transformed into a professional antigen-presenting cell (APC) by upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules driven partially by the tissue-speci fi c expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) [ 55 ] . Increased TLR2 expression in conjunction with TLR2 stimulation by the TLR2 ligand in LCWE leads to increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules facilitating rescue of SAg-activated T cells and continued local production of proin fl ammatory cytokines [ 71, 72 ] . This leads to further exacerbation of the in fl ammation at the coronary vessel wall [ 55 ] . IFN-g and TNF-a are involved in transcriptional regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), with TNF-a upregulating, and IFN-g inhibiting production of MMP-9 [ 55, 73 ] . Following that, the enzymatic activity of MMP-9 leads to elastin breakdown and aneurysm formation [ 73 ] . Of note, recently Alvira et al. have shown that in the coronary arteritis associated with KD, TGF-b suppresses elastin degradation by inhibiting plasmin-mediated MMP-9 activation [ 74 ] . Thus, strategies to block TGF-b , used in those with Marfan syndrome, are unlikely to be bene fi cial in KD as they lead to worsening of elastin degradation in this murine model of KD [ 74 ] . So in summary, a sustained local immune response together with persistent TNF-a production and leucocyte recruitment lead to upregulation of proteolytic activity, elastin degradation, vessel wall damage and the characteristic coronary artery lesions seen in KD [ 55 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 198, "text": "[ 65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 199, "end": 203, "text": "66 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 303, "end": 307, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 313, "end": 317, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 318, "end": 322, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 323, "end": 327, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 522, "end": 526, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 527, "end": 531, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 532, "end": 536, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 537, "end": 541, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 542, "end": 546, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 730, "end": 734, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 735, "end": 739, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 740, "end": 744, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 745, "end": 749, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 750, "end": 754, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 863, "end": 869, "text": "[ 60 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1191, "end": 1197, "text": "[ 55 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1368, "text": "[ 55 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1601, "text": "[ 60 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1729, "text": "[ 55 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1870, "text": "[ 68 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2176, "text": "[ 70 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2407, "end": 2413, "text": "[ 55 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2671, "end": 2676, "text": "[ 71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 2677, "end": 2681, "text": "72 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2769, "end": 2775, "text": "[ 55 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2940, "end": 2945, "text": "[ 55,", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2946, "end": 2950, "text": "73 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 3051, "end": 3057, "text": "[ 73 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 3239, "end": 3245, "text": "[ 74 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 3432, "end": 3438, "text": "[ 74 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 3702, "end": 3708, "text": "[ 55 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "In Vivo Experimental Data in KD"}, {"text": "Although the clinical syndrome and occurrence of epidemics suggest an infectious cause for KD, a genetic contribution to risk is suggested by the much higher prevalence of the disease in Japan and Korea than elsewhere, and by increased prevalence within families with an increased relative risk to siblings compared to the general population [ 75 ] .

The prevalence of CAA is inversely related to the total dose of IVIG [ 97 ] , 2 g/kg of IVIG being the optimal dose, usually given as a single infusion [ 96 ] . Meta-analysis of RCTs comparing divided lower doses of IVIG (400 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days) versus a single infusion of high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg over 10 h) has clearly shown that even though the 4-day regimen has some bene fi t, a single dose of 2 g/kg has a greater therapeutic effect in the prevention of CAA [ 96, 97 ] . However, IVIG resistance occurs in up to 20% of cases [ 98 ] . In those cases most advocate a second dose of IVIG and/or the use of corticosteroids. Regarding corticosteroid use in IVIG resistant to KD, there are apparently con fl icting data from clinical trials. Inoue et al. reported on a randomized control trial of 178 KD patients who were assigned to receive IVIG (1 g/kg/day) for two consecutive days, given over 12 h, or IVIG plus prednisolone sodium succinate (2 mg/kg/day) three times daily, given by intravenous (IV) injection until the fever resolved and then orally until the C-reactive protein (CRP) level normalized [ 98 ] . Patients in both groups received aspirin (30 mg/kg) and dipyridamole (2 mg/kg/day) [ 98 ] . The addition of corticosteroid was associated with reduced CAA compared with IVIG alone: in those receiving IVIG and anti-platelet therapy, 11.4% had CAA at 1 month, compared with 2.2% in those receiving IVIG plus corticosteroids [ 98 ] . Also the duration of fever was shorter and CRP decreased more rapidly in the group of patients receiving corticosteroids [ 98 ] . In contrast, Newburger et al. in a subsequent multicenter, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effect of the addition of a single dose of intravenous methylprednisolone to standard therapy [ 99 ] . They found that this corticosteroid regimen did not improve the CAA outcome in these children [ 99 ] . These contrasting results suggest that dose and duration of corticosteroids may be critical when considering this as adjunctive therapy in KD. In fl iximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-a , has been reported to be effective for the treatment of IVIG-resistant KD [ 100, 101 ] . In 13 of 16 patients with failed response to a single dose or IVIG who received in fl iximab, there was cessation of fever followed by reduction in CRP [ 100 ] .

There was cessation of fever within 24 h in 11 of 12 subjects treated with in fl iximab and in 8 of 12 subjects retreated with IVIG [ 101 ] . No signi fi cant differences were observed between treatment groups in the change from baseline for laboratory variables, fever or echocardiographic assessment of coronary arteries [ 101 ] . These reports are encouraging but further RCTs to establish the optimal management of KD, and in particular IVIG-resistant KD, are needed [ 102 ] . In that respect a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial intended to assess the ef fi cacy of etanercept (a fusion protein combining the TNF receptor 2 and the Fc component of human IgG1) in reducing the IVIG refractory rate during treatment of acute KD is ongoing [ 103 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 145, "text": "[ 96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 146, "end": 150, "text": "97 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 222, "end": 228, "text": "[ 97 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 305, "end": 311, "text": "[ 96 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 630, "end": 635, "text": "[ 96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 636, "end": 640, "text": "97 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 697, "end": 703, "text": "[ 98 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1280, "text": "[ 98 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1372, "text": "[ 98 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1611, "text": "[ 98 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1735, "end": 1741, "text": "[ 98 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1960, "end": 1966, "text": "[ 99 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2069, "text": "[ 99 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2349, "end": 2355, "text": "[ 100,", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2361, "text": "101 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2516, "end": 2523, "text": "[ 100 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2755, "end": 2762, "text": "[ 101 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2897, "end": 2904, "text": "[ 101 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 3088, "end": 3095, "text": "[ 101 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 3236, "end": 3243, "text": "[ 102 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 3537, "end": 3544, "text": "[ 103 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment"}, {"text": "In the convalescent phase of the condition, if aneurysms persist, anti-platelet therapy in the form of low-dose aspirin should be continued long term until the aneurysms resolve [ 56 ] .

In more detail, Savage et al. showed that activation of neutrophils by ANCA causes integrin-and cytokine receptor-mediated adherence to cultured endothelial cells and transmigration across the endothelial layer [ 116 ] . In addition, activation of neutrophils with ANCA causes a conformational change in beta-2 integrins that enhances ligand binding [ 116 ] . A role for adhesion molecules in the interaction between ANCA-activated neutrophils and vessels also is supported by immunohistologic evidence of upregulated adhesion molecules in glomerular lesions in renal biopsy specimens from patients with AAV [ 117 ] . In addition to binding to the surface of endothelial cells, both PR3 and MPO are internalized into endothelial cells, where they have different pathologic effects [ 118 ] . For example, after internalization, PR3 causes endothelial cell apoptosis, whereas MPO causes generation of intracellular oxidants [ 118 ] . These differences in MPO and PR3 interaction with endothelial cells could in fl uence the patterns of tissue injury induced when these antigens react with ANCA at the endothelial cell surface [ 111 ] . Furthermore, there is new evidence that after neutrophil activation by ANCA, the neutrophils are driven down an accelerated apoptotic death pathway by reactive oxygen species [ 119 ] . These neutrophils develop the morphologic features of apoptosis, but there is dysregulated coordination of cell surface changes that normally accompany apoptosis, including delay in phosphatidylserine expression [ 119 ] , which could contribute to failure of these apoptotic cells to be recognized and safely removed by phagocytes [ 119 ] . Apoptotic neutrophils eventually disintegrate, releasing cytotoxic contents within vascular tissue. This process may explain the leucocytoclasia often seen in vasculitic lesions. Also pertaining to safe clearance of apoptotic neutrophils are two studies showing that apoptotic neutrophils can express proteinase-3 and myeloperoxidase at the cell surface, which can act as an opsonin for ANCA [ 120, 121 ] . Both apoptotic and ANCA opsonized apoptotic neutrophils can be phagocytosed by macrophages, but whereas the former induce an anti-in fl ammatory response from the macrophage release of interleukin-10, the latter are taken up more avidly and are proin fl ammatory by inducing macrophage release of interleukin-1, interleukin-8 and TNF [ 120, 121 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 261, "end": 268, "text": "[ 111 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 271, "end": 303, "text": "Falk et al. demonstrated in 1990", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 409, "end": 416, "text": "[ 112 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 727, "end": 734, "text": "[ 113 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 918, "end": 925, "text": "[ 113 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1107, "text": "[ 114 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1349, "text": "[ 115 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1442, "text": "[ 115 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1663, "text": "[ 116 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 1795, "end": 1802, "text": "[ 116 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 2053, "end": 2060, "text": "[ 117 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 2226, "end": 2233, "text": "[ 118 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 2367, "end": 2374, "text": "[ 118 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 2569, "end": 2576, "text": "[ 111 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 2754, "end": 2761, "text": "[ 119 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 2976, "end": 2983, "text": "[ 119 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 3095, "end": 3102, "text": "[ 119 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 3497, "end": 3503, "text": "[ 120,", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 3504, "end": 3509, "text": "121 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 3846, "end": 3852, "text": "[ 120,", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 3853, "end": 3858, "text": "121 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "In Vitro Studies"}, {"text": "The signalling cascades that lead to functional responses such as superoxide release are only beginning to be elucidated.

The mixed in fl ammatory in fi ltrate in WG is composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, histiocytes and giant cells [ 124 ] . Since INF-g and T cells play pivotal roles in granuloma formation, alterations of the T-cell and cytokine response could contribute to anomalous autoantigen presentation in ectopic lymphoid-like structures and sustain autoimmunity to PR3 [ 125 ] . Skewing of the T-cell phenotype with expansion of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells lacking CD28 expression is seen in WG [ 126, 127 ] . Expansion of CD28 negative T cells is already evident in localized WG and further increases in generalized disease [ 126, 127 ] . Abundant IFN-g , CD26 and Th-1 type CC chemokine receptor CCR5 expression are seen in granulomatous lesions of the respiratory tract in localized WG, but appear less strong in generalized WG [ 128, 129 ] . Moreover, a fraction of Th2 type IL-4 producing CCR3+ T cells is present in the circulation and tissue lesions in generalized but not in localized WG [ 128 ] .

In addition, Th17 cells have been recently described as major effector cells in autoimmune diseases [ 131 ] . It has been demonstrated that stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PR3-ANCA positive patients with WG with the autoantigen PR3 results in production of interleukin (IL)-17 and not INF-g , demonstrating that the autoimmune effector cells are Th17 cells [ 132 ] .

Jones et al. report on the results of a randomized trial of rituximab versus cyclophosphamide in ANCA-associated renal vasculitis (RITUXIVAS) and Stone et al. report on the results of the rituximab in ANCA-associated vasculitis (RAVE) trial [ 184, 185 ] . Similar conclusions are reached in the two studies [ 184, 185 ] . Both trials showed that rituximab was ef fi cacious in inducing a remission, as compared with intravenous cyclophosphamide (in the RITUXIVAS trial) or oral cyclophosphamide (in the RAVE trial) [ 184, 185 ] . There are, however, a number of important differences between the two trials. In the RITUXIVAS trial, patients who were randomly assigned to the rituximab group also received at least two doses of intravenous cyclophosphamide, whereas in the RAVE trial, patients randomly assigned to the rituximab group did not receive any cyclophosphamide [ 184, 185 ] . The trials were similar in that all patients in both trials received both intravenous and oral glucocorticoid therapy [ 184, 185 ] . Investigators in the RITUXIVAS trial reported sustained remission for 12 months, whereas outcome data from the RAVE trial were reported only on the 6-month remission-induction period [ 184, 185 ] . The RAVE trial data were confounded by the use of glucocorticoid therapy for 5 of the 6 months of follow-up [ 185 ] . In addition, both trials raised concerns about the substantial complications from the use of rituximab and other immunomodulating agents in ANCA-associated disease [ 184, 185 ] . Fewer adverse events would have been expected in patients treated with rituximab as compared with cyclophosphamide. Unfortunately, in the RAVE trial the rate of adverse events was equivalent in the two study groups [ 185 ] . Similarly, in the RITUXIVAS study, 6 of 33 patients in the rituximab group died, as did 2 of 11 patients in the control group [ 184 ] . The RAVE trial also showed an unexpectedly elevated number of malignant conditions detected over a relatively short treatment period [ 185 ] . These studies suggest that rituximab might be considered as an option for fi rst-line therapy for induction of remission of ANCA-associated disease. It remains unclear whether rituximab should be used with glucocorticoids alone or in combination with intravenous cyclophosphamide.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 70, "end": 74, "text": "[ 3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 75, "end": 80, "text": "174 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 121, "end": 128, "text": "[ 181 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF180"}, {"start": 335, "end": 339, "text": "[ 3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 340, "end": 345, "text": "174 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}, {"start": 496, "end": 502, "text": "[ 182,", "ref_id": "BIBREF181"}, {"start": 503, "end": 508, "text": "183 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 669, "end": 675, "text": "[ 184,", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 676, "end": 681, "text": "185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 925, "end": 931, "text": "[ 184,", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 932, "end": 937, "text": "185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 991, "end": 997, "text": "[ 184,", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 998, "end": 1003, "text": "185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1205, "text": "[ 184,", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1211, "text": "185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1561, "text": "[ 184,", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1567, "text": "185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 1688, "end": 1694, "text": "[ 184,", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1700, "text": "185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1892, "text": "[ 184,", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1898, "text": "185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2016, "text": "[ 185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 2183, "end": 2189, "text": "[ 184,", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 2190, "end": 2195, "text": "185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 2413, "end": 2420, "text": "[ 185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 2549, "end": 2556, "text": "[ 184 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 2692, "end": 2699, "text": "[ 185 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment of AAV"}, {"text": "Biologic therapy is also increasingly used to treat children with small vessel vasculitis, including AAV and ANCA negative vasculitides [ 186 ] .

As a consequence, the endothelium not only displays altered functions but also loses its integrity. Endothelial microparticles (EMPs) released from activated or apoptotic endothelial cells and whole endothelial cells, circulating endothelial cells (CECs), detached from injured vessels constitute a fundamental feature of these injurious responses affecting the vessel wall [229] [230] [231] .

These stem cells are mobilized from the bone marrow and are able to differentiate into mature cells, restoring endothelial integrity at sites of vascular injury [ 232 ] . This spectrum of endothelial responses can be considered in a dynamic triad \"activation/injury/ repair\", which has critically transformed our understanding of endothelial biology.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 170, "text": "[ 227 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF226"}, {"start": 373, "end": 380, "text": "[ 228 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF227"}, {"start": 757, "end": 762, "text": "[229]", "ref_id": "BIBREF228"}, {"start": 763, "end": 768, "text": "[230]", "ref_id": "BIBREF229"}, {"start": 769, "end": 774, "text": "[231]", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 871, "end": 878, "text": "[ 232 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1215, "text": "[ 232 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1386, "text": "[ 232 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF231"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Novel Biomarkers for Vasculitis Disease Activity: Tracking Endothelial Injury and Repair"}, {"text": "CECs and EMPs are sensitive biomarkers of vascular injury for monitoring disease activity and response to therapy in children with vasculitis [ 233 ] .

The emergence of new therapies for the treatment of vasculitis in children provides a real opportunity to limit cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid exposure in the young. These include MMF [ 182, 183, 240, 241 ] and biologic agents such as rituximab [ 184, 185, 187 ] , anti-TNF-a [ 187, 242 ] and thalidomide analogues such as lenalidomide [ 243 ] , amongst others.
