Confirmatory clinical trials, or phase 3 trials, are intended to provide firm evidence for efficacy and safety claims. Clinical trial primary endpoints are mainly a combination of physiological and clinical response measures. However, in addition to these endpoints, patient reported outcomes (PROs) are often included. Patient direct report is central to the overall evaluation of drug effect to fully understand how a patient feels or functions in response to a treatment. This understanding can be critical in assessing safety and efficacy and may provide important insight to generate patient-relevant information for pharmaceutical products [1].",

The importance on the weight of \u201cfit for purpose\u201d evidence provided by the qualification process must be compared against competing priorities of drug development timelines, drug differentiation strategies, the need for patient-related value messages, and the depth of a sponsor pipeline within specific disease areas.

As a corollary to issues of cross cultural adaptation, we must be aware that some PRO data may be influenced by those other than the patient and may not be a reflection of the patient experience alone but instead a reflection of a more complex interaction between the patient, family, community or a physician/patient relationship. Teams must be aware of the needs and special challenges required and prepare for the resource needs to collect quality, evaluable PRO data so that the patient voice may continue to emerge from the context of confirmatory clinical trials.
