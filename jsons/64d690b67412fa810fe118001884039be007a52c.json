While some studies show high and persistent rates of MHP in populations directly affected by isolation, quarantine, threat of infection, infection, or life-threatening symptoms (e.g. health care workers), other studies report minor effects. Furthermore, even less affected populations (e.g. distant to epidemic epicenter, no contact history with suspected or confirmed cases) can show high rates of MHP.",

Individuals affected directly by an epidemic might be at a higher risk of short or even long-term mental health impairments. This study delivers insights stemming from a wide range of psychiatric instruments and questionnaires. The results call for the use of validated and standardized instruments, reference norms, and pre-post measurements to better understand the magnitude of the MHP during and after the epidemics. Nevertheless, emerging MHP should be considered during epidemics including the provision of access to mental health care to mitigate potential mental impairments.",

Epidemic outbreaks can result in high case fatality rates and morbidity (Van Bortel et al., 2016; Meo et al., 2020) and may require communities to introduce restrictive public health measures like isolation, mass quarantine, and community containment interventions in order to stop transmissions and save lives (Wilder-Smith and Freedman, 2020) . In consequence, epidemics can cause a high individual and societal burden and can lead to substantial economic loss (Smith, 2006; Mak et al., 2009; Van Bortel et al., 2016; Dorn et al., 2020) . While considerable efforts rely on protective and treatment measures such as virus transmission pathways, clinical presentations, and the development of vaccinations, attention is only recently given to short or long-term mental health problems (MHP, hereafter defined as psychiatric/psychological symptoms and mental illness/disorders) (Rajkumar, 2020) that may arise due to the different surrounding consequences of an epidemic in the general public, health care workers (HCW), and survivors of infectious diseases (survivors).",

As a result, these factors can elicit feelings of anxiety, anger, loneliness, grief, boredom and may lead to serious MHP (Brooks et al., 2020; Chew et al., 2020; Fardin, 2020) . Furthermore, the extensive and sometimes controversial mass media coverage during epidemics may amplify uncertainty, loss of control and anxiety (Brooks et al., 2020; Fardin, 2020) . Aside from the general public, HCW are prone to different MHP since they usually face an immediate threat of infection through patient contact by working at the epidemic frontline. Studies suggest that HCW accounted for up to 57% of SARS-CoV-1, 27% of MERS-CoV, and 12% of Ebola cases in some countries, which frequently resulted in morbidity or even death (Chan-Yeung, 2004; Suwantarat and Apisarnthanarak, 2015) . In HCW, epidemics often result in difficult working conditions like staff shortage, increased workload (Van Bortel et al., 2016) , overwhelming patient numbers (Suwantarat and Apisarnthanarak, 2015; Van Bortel et al., 2016) , limited safety equipment (Van",

Furthermore, many studies reported problems like loneliness, boredom, anger, worries about family members (Wang et al., 2020a) , and financial problems or economic loss (Chua et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2005; Mishra et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2020 ) that negatively interfere with mental health. In contrast, accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) (Wang et al., 2020a) , particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) (Wang et al., 2020a) , social support (Ko et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2006; Cao et al., 2020) , and appraisals and coping strategies (Cheng et al., 2004b; Chew et al., 2020 ) may be protective.",

We found only few studies that did not utilize a cross-sectional design without repetition. Further, most cross-sectional studies did not report any comparative data from which the change of prevalence rates due to the epidemic could be estimated. Sampling characteristics were also varying. Only about half of the studies in the general public were based on representative samples. As many studies were conducted during or shortly after the peak phase of the epidemic, results have to be regarded as acute stress reactions that do not allow for inference of longer-lasting MHP. While some authors used well established and widely used instruments and standardized diagnostic interviews (e.g. Ji et al. (2017) or Lancee et al.

Pfefferbaum and North (2020) pointed out, that the monitoring of psychosocial needs should assess SARS-CoV-2-related stressors, secondary adversities, psychosocial effects, and indicators of vulnerability. Besides others, routine outcome monitoring (Carlier et al., 2012 ) as a measurement feedback system, apps for (self-)monitoring of mood, sleep-quality, or medication adherence (Rubanovich et al., 2017) , and artificial intelligence predicting relevant psychiatric outcomes (Lovejoy et al., 2019) , are available for public mental health monitoring. In the best case, mental health service providers should be aided by e-monitoring during epidemics. As mentioned above, in research MHP should be assessed by standardized diagnostic interviews or measurement instruments enabling appropriate case detection identifying risk groups in order to inform policy and practice.",

In epidemic conditions, where consultation in-person is restricted there are important implications for digital health approaches. Online psychotherapy and consultation might help to improve access to mental health care, particularly in times of quarantine and isolation (Langarizadeh et al., 2017; Tuerk et al., 2018) . It does need to be highlighted that the effectiveness of online services for the improvement of mental health services requires further assessment (Kauer et al., 2014) . Consequently, the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 calls for rapid reports and insights, as well as long-term health service research focusing on both remote and in-person mental health resources during epidemics (Starace and Ferrara, 2020; Wind et al., 2020) .",

MHP might be especially prominent among HCW and survivors that are directly affected by epidemics and face a real threat of infection and difficult circumstances like isolation/quarantine or difficult working conditions. As shown by various original studies, MHP across all populations can be substantially influenced by risk and protective factors, some of which are modifiable like social support and appropriate information by authorities. From a clinical point of view, policy makers and health care providers should be aware of potential short term or even persistent MHP. During epidemics, mental health care needs to be adapted to changing circumstances in order to grant access and treatment to those in need. Digital mental health approaches can support access to care for the public. This allows for psychological monitoring and treatment when in-person consultations are not possible. Yet, digital health interventions are still in developmental stages and need further assessment. During lockdowns, they seem to be a relevant supplement to the provision of inperson mental health care. Furthermore, HCW that often account for a substantial fraction of virus cases need to be supported. However, health authorities and policy makers should keep in mind separating short-term acute stress reactions from long-term mental illness.",

Thus, results should be treated with some caution since a comparison of prevalence rates across studies and assessment of magnitude of MHP is currently not possible. Future studies should monitor MHP with standardized methods and apply comparisons with country-specific norms in order to gain a better understanding of MHP, to learn about influential factors, and to better understand how to provide appropriate access to mental health care during epidemics. Although, this was out of scope for this review, evidence of MHP in vulnerable populations such as children or people with pre-existing mental illness seems to be scarce and should be covered in future studies.",
