Second, although individual differences in anxiety and coping responses can be major in certain circumstances, they can also be minimal in others (e.g., after the mass infection).

            "text": "The state-trait approach is a major theoretical perspective on anxiety. This approach has a significant impact on anxiety research (e.g., Anton & Klisch, 1995; Gupta, 1989) . In the state-trait theories of anxiety (Cattell, 1963; Spielberger, 1972) , anxiety is conceptualized as a complex construct that comprises both a transitory state and a personality trait. The transitory state, or as it is more commonly termed, state anxiety, refers to a condition that varies in strength over time. State anxiety is evoked in situations perceived by individuals as threatening. The amount of state anxiety experienced is a function of the extent of perceived threat. The personality trait, or as it is more commonly termed, trait anxiety, refers to individual differences in proneness to experience state anxiety in threatening situations. Such anxiety-proneness is relatively stable over time. The state-trait theories of anxiety related individual differences in anxiety to personality dispositions. Trait anxiety is proposed as a predictor of state anxiety. Compared to individuals lower in trait anxiety, individuals higher in trait anxiety are speculated to experience greater state anxiety in threatening situations. Although threatening situations elicit anxiety among most individuals, the heightened anxiety levels may remain high for some but subside for others. The construct of coping has been considered an important mediator that accounts for the stress-anxiety relationship (e.g., Folkman & Lazarus, 1988; Krohne, 1986) . In the transaction theory of coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) , coping is considered as an ongoing process that occurs within the interface of changing personal and situational demands. Coping is conceptualized as a statelike, situation-specific response for meeting the unique demands of distinct stressful situations. This theory provides a detailed account of how individuals change their behaviors when handling different types of situations. Situation-specific coping is proposed to play a role in mitigating anxiety in the coping process.",

Lazarus and Folkman (1984) put forward a goodness-of-fit hypothesis in their theory to explain coping efficacy. Effective coping involves a good ''fit'' or match between situational characteristics and the nature of coping strategies. Individuals who deploy coping strategies that meet specific situational demands are said to experience adaptive outcomes in stressful encounters. Because the environment is ever changing, the construct of coping flexibility (see e.g., Cheng, 2003; Watanabe, Iwanaga, & Ozeki, 2002) was proposed to reflect situation-appropriate coping in changing times. Coping flexibility is conceptualized as the ability to distinguish among different situations and to switch strategies to meet changing situational demands (see e.g., Cheng, 2001; Schwartz & Daltroy, 1999) . The construct has been found to be inversely related to anxiety (e.g., Kaluza, 2000; Lester, Smart, & Baum, 1994; Mattlin, Wethington, & Kessler, 1990; Watanabe et al., 2002) . Individuals who are more flexible in coping, compared to those who are less flexible in coping, tend to experience less anxiety across stressful situations.",

A person with chronic renal disease, believed to be the ''superspreader,'' spread the disease to hundreds of residents in a building block. The nature of the ambiguous, stressful context quickly turned into an imminent danger. Alarmed by mass infection in the community, people were almost unanimous in actively adopting coping strategies to avoid contracting SARS. At Time 3, a hoaxer further aroused panic by hijacking the design of a major newspaper Web site. The hoaxer posted a bogus news item that Hong Kong would soon be declared an infected region and be sealed off from the rest of the world. Such a rumor quickly spread around the city, causing panic-stricken people to mob stores to buy necessities. While the influence of this anxiety-arousing rumor was attenuated, another anxiety-provoking event emerged shortly after that. At Time 4, the number of death cases had grown rapidly. Within the week, death cases were reported every day, the highest being five for a particular day. Deaths were no longer confined to the elderly and people with serious illnesses, but also involved healthy young adults, thus further adding to the mystery of SARS.",

Five months before this study, the trait anxiety and coping flexibility of a sample of Hong Kong undergraduates were assessed. Their previously measured trait anxiety and coping flexibility served as predictors in the present study. These participants were invited to take part in this 4-week study, in which their anxiety states and situation-specific coping responses were assessed at each of the four time points.

The coping flexibility score was inversely associated with anxiety and depression but positively associated with quality of life, thus providing evidence for the criterion-related validity of the measure.

The second factor, lifestyle habits, consisted of four items: (a) eat a nutritious diet, (b) exercise regularly, (c) get an adequate amount of sleep and rest, and (d) watch, listen to, or read news reports. The third factor, information seeking, includes two items: (a) seek information/advice from health professionals, and (b) search for information over the Internet. The fourth factor, avoidance, comprises four items: (a) avoid going out to eat, (b) avoid going shopping, (c) avoid shaking hands with people, and (d) avoid meeting people who cough, sneeze, or have just been back from a SARS-infected region. This 4-factor solution was considered to be optimal based on three criteria: variance accounted for (i.e., 64%), interpretability, and simple structure. All these coping subscales are internally consistent (Cronbach's alphas 5 .73, .64, .63, and .77, respectively).

            "text": "Such changes in the predictive role of trait anxiety over time may be attributable to the changing nature of the threatening event. At Psychological Responses to SARS Outbreak the outset of the outbreak, panic and fear among the public arose from the many obscurities surrounding the disease, such as its source, causal agent, means of transmission, and ways of treatment. At this stage of ambiguity, individuals higher in trait anxiety may have been more likely to interpret the event as highly threatening and to have experienced higher levels of anxiety than those lower in trait anxiety. Such a notion stems from Beck's (1976) cognitive theory of anxiety. This theory posits that individuals with heightened anxiety are characterized by an interpretative bias, which facilitates threatladen construal of ambiguous events. A number of studies (e.g., Calvo, Eysenck, & Castillo, 1997; Hadwin, Frost, French, & Richards, 1997; MacLeod & Cohen, 1993; Mathews & Mackintosh, 2000) have provided support to this postulation by showing that individuals with heightened trait anxiety tend to endorse a threatening interpretation of an ambiguous situation than do their counterparts lower in trait anxiety. In light of this theory, the fear and worries generated by SARS were probably due to its ambiguity and novelty. As shown in a population survey (Lam et al., 2003) , about 10% of the Hong Kong respondents believed that the probability of themselves having a SARS infection was greater that that of their contracting influenza or the common cold. Such a finding suggests the presence of interpretation bias among some of the public. After the probable causal agent (i.e., coronavirus) and potential treatment methods (e.g., corticosteroids and ribavirin) of SARS were identified at the end of March (see Nie, Luo, & Hui, 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; So et al., 2003) , the ambiguity of the disease may have diminished and the predictive role of trait anxiety may have been weakened. Apart from trait anxiety, situation-specific coping strategies of personal hygiene practice and avoidance were also found to predict fluctuations in state anxiety over the 4-week period. Compared to lifestyle habits and information seeking, the results showed that personal hygiene practice and avoidance played a stronger role in explaining state anxiety. The avoidance strategies used by participants to handle the SARS outbreak can be categorized as avoidant coping, which is a major type of coping strategy (see Roth & Cohen, 1986) . In the coping literature, avoidant coping refers to attempts to escape from the stressful event (see Roth & Cohen, 1986) . The present results showed that individuals who used more avoidance tended to experience less state anxiety during the study period. Such results may be explained by the issue of control in the study of contextual coping (see e.g., Lefcourt, 1992 for an overview). To elaborate, if the outcome of a stressful event is controllable or changeable, it will be more adaptive in altering the specific aspect of the person-environment relationship causing the anxiety. For a stressful event whose outcome is beyond one's control, however, it seems maladaptive to engage in futile attempts to do something to solve the uncontrollable problem. Hence, the adaptiveness of avoidant strategies, as revealed in this study, suggests that the SARS outbreak was largely an uncontrollable stressful event. The novel, unknown characteristics of the SARS virus posed challenges to healthcare professionals and perplexed the government and health authorities around the world. Not knowing how to cope with this unknown, but life-threatening, disease, individuals may have adopted avoidant strategies to prevent themselves from contracting SARS from other people or in public areas. Adopting such strategies may have functioned to ease their anxiety during the outbreak.",

The greater use of this strategy elicited greater state anxiety among Hong Kong people.

After these measures had been extensively publicized, the frequency of practice of personal hygiene increased (see Lam et al., 2003; Tang & Wong, 2003) . The present findings suggest that adoption of such preventive measures may elicit greater anxiety while the use of more avoidant coping may mitigate anxiety. However, it is also likely that those who are more anxious may adopt more preventive measures and less avoidance. Additional analyses using coping strategies as the dependent variables were conducted with trait anxiety and coping styles as level-2 predictors. Results revealed that coping flexibility was also significant in predicting the initial status, linear change, and quadratic change of personal hygiene practice. Specifically, people with higher levels of coping flexibility tended to increase their practice of personal hygiene at the beginning of the outbreak and then reduced their practice over time. However, coping flexibility was not significant in predicting the other three situation-specific coping strategies. Further studies are required to investigative the possible directions of influence among these variables.",

            "text": "The present study may have implications for personality theories. In personality psychology, the trait approach and the person-situation interactionist approach are two major theoretical paradigms explicating individual differences in behaviors. Trait theories (e.g., Allport, 1961; Cattell, 1967) propose that individuals are predisposed to a particular personality trait or style, which remains largely stable across situations. Person-situation interactionist theories (e.g., Magnusson, 1974; Mischel, 1977) maintain that personality characteristics are manifested in some situations but not in others. These two approaches to personality may each have made unique contributions to the literature. Stable personality traits may be useful in predicting behavioral tendency. Situation-specific behaviors may provide a detailed account of how individuals react to the specific demands of situations. Consistent with this notion, the present results suggest that both personality traits and situation-specific behaviors can predict anxiety responses in a real-life stressful context. An integrative approach may be beneficial in addressing the confluence of these perspectives by including both stable personality style and situationdriven responses in the study of behaviors. The understanding of behaviors may be enhanced by an analysis of these two types of factors.",

Although it is possible to analyze longitudinal data using repeated measures analytical methods, HLM offers several unique advantages over these traditional methods.

            "text": "Before concluding, several caveats are noteworthy. First, the present study examined two types of psychological responses, namely emotional and coping responses. Emotional response is indicated by anxiety, whereas coping response is assessed by a limited set of coping behaviors. It should be noted that anxiety and coping behaviors may not be the only variables that account for individual differences in state anxiety. In coping research, coping includes not only behavioral coping but also cognitive coping. It is possible that some participants may have adopted cognitive and behavioral strategies other than those listed in the questionnaire developed for this study. Further studies examining the integrative approach should expand the scope of psychological responses by including cognitive and behavioral coping strategies.",

            "text": "Second, a notable caveat of this study is its relatively small sample size. The predictive role of trait anxiety and personal hygiene practice was found to be marginally significant. Such results may be attributable to the lack of power due to the relatively small sample size and the relatively few time points. The sample size issue is complicated in HLM because there are two levels of sample size: (a) number of measurement occasions at level 1, and (b) number of participants at level 2. Raudenbush and Liu (2000) suggested a trade-off between sample sizes at different levels. Increasing the number of measurement occasions at level 1 can reduce the number of participants at level 2 provided that the same power is required to detect the changes across time. Maxwell (2000) also demonstrated how statistical power increases dramatically when more time-points are added to the design. Thus, researchers using HLM should consider the sample size issue at both levels.",

Participants were asked to report coping strategies they had used in the past week. The study by Stone and colleagues (1998) showed that retrospective report could not reflect momentary coping. The longer the time period of recall, the greater the differences between retrospective and momentary coping (see also Coyne & Gottlieb, 1996) . Although participants in this study reported their coping in a relatively short period (i.e., 7 days), it is still possible that their retrospective account does not represent their coping responses at certain moments.",

At the time of writing, the World Health Organization (WHO) has cleared the list of SARS-affected regions and has lifted all travel warnings. However, there is no evidence that SARS will be vanquished. The WHO has warned of a possible return of the epidemic in coming influenza seasons. Also, the pathogenesis and the mode of transmission of the disease are still largely unknown. Once the mysteries behind this disease have been understood, the nature of the SARS epidemic may no longer be a health threat and the general public's anxiety and coping responses to the disease may be different from those obtained in this study.",
