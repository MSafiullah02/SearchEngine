Consequent to the success of antiretroviral therapy and the longevity expected for PLWH, over recent decades there has been a gradual upward shift in the median age of PLWH. Antiretroviral therapy management becomes increasingly challenging in older individuals due to the presence of non-infectious co-morbidities2, which are reported to occur at a higher incidence in PLWH compared to matched control populations, the presence of poly-pharmacy and drug-drug interactions. As such, there is an urgent unmet need for new antiretroviral agents and combinations for older PLWH which includes drugs with a low propensity for drug-drug interactions and which lack end-organ toxicities3.",

Their mechanism of action is to prevent the formation of a critical intermediate along the virus-cell fusion pathway responsible for enacting cell-virus fusion. To date, only one FI, enfuvirtide has been approved for use4, 5. Clinical use of enfuvirtide has been limited by the lack of oral bioavailability and short half-life, thus necessitating twice daily subcutaneous injections, and high rates of painful injection site reactions (ISRs). Notwithstanding, enfuvirtide and other investigational FIs display low systemic toxicity and a general lack of drug-drug interactions, making them promising for further investigation as antiretroviral agents4\u20136. Modification of a number of FI compounds has prolonged their plasma half-lives in animal models and fueled a renewed interest in their development as potentially long-acting antiretroviral drugs suitable for use in older PLWH with comorbidities and receiving concomitant medications7\u20139.",

            "text": "Extensive evidence supports that HIV viral entry occurs within cholesterol and sphingolipid enriched cell membrane domains known as \u2018lipid rafts\u201910, 11. Notably, CD4+ receptors, the primary receptors on HIV target cells, lie within lipid rafts on the target membrane. In addition, gp41 associates with caveolin-1, the structural protein component of a subset of lipid rafts known as caveolae. C34 is a lead compound corresponding to amino acid residues 117\u2013150 of the HR-2 region of gp41. By conjugating to C34 a cholesterol group with a 4-unit polyethylene glycol (PEG4) spacer, the compound is concentrated in lipid rafts of cell membranes. Compared with underivatised C34, C34-PEG4-Chol shows dramatically increased antiviral potency on a panel of primary isolates, with 90% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC90) values 15- to 300-fold lower than enfuvirtide. With an IC90 between 15\u2013460 pM (0.08\u20132.5 ng/mL) depending on the viral strain, C34-PEG4-Chol is the most potent HIV fusion inhibitor to date12. Moreover, the cholesterol moiety drives binding to serum proteins, an effective way to improve peptide pharmacokinetics13 and accordingly, the circulatory half-life of C34 in rodents is extended by 10-fold when conjugated with cholesterol12. Allometric scaling from animal studies suggests that once-weekly subcutaneous administration in humans may be achievable with a dose range of 10\u201380 mg.",

The peptide was purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, and analytical HPLC. The peptide was formulated by Symbiosis (Stirling, UK). Briefly, the purified peptide was dissolved in 0.1 M Sodium Phosphate Buffer, pH 7.4, containing 15% w/v of 2-Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, sterile-filtered and lyophilized in individual vials.

An electrocardiogram was performed pre-dose and 4 and 12 hours after dosing. A decision to proceed with dose escalation was made only after all four participants in each dose cohort had been observed for a minimum of 7 days for safety assessments.

Plasma samples (100 \u00b5L) were extracted in 300 \u00b5L of acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid; vortexed and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was transferred into autosampler vials, and 25 \u03bcL injected onto the LC-MS/MS. Quantitative analysis of C34-PEG4-Chol was performed by LC-MS/MS using a Thermo Quantum Access triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, interfaced with a heated electrospray ionisation (H-ESI) source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). The HPLC system included a variable loop Accela autosampler and an Accela pump (ThermoScientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK).

Detection of C34-PEG4-Chol was performed in the pseudo Selected Reaction Monitoring mode, monitoring a triple charged molecular ion [M + 3 H]3 + at m/z 1756.8. The internal standard (quinoxaline), was monitored at m/z 313.1 \u2192 246.1. Peak area ratios of compound to internal standard were utilized to construct a calibration curve with a weighting of 1/x2.

In the pre-clinical studies, ISRs had not been observed in mice and were mild and reversible in dogs. In this species ISRs, albeit milder, were also observed in the control group, suggesting that the chosen formulation might have contributed to the side-effect. Although high rates of ISRs are observed with subcutaneous administration of enfuvirtide, and therefore not an absolute impediment for clinical use, in the present scenario of HIV therapeutics we do not consider this route of administration suitable for further clinical development. Rather, intramuscular administration might represent a viable option, in light of recent data showing that rates of ISR are less marked when long-acting rilprivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor is administered via intramuscular administration compared to subcutaneous18. Identification of both an administration route and a different formulation for C34-PEG4-chol that minimises ISRs would be attractive, since the preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of C34-PEG4-Chol we have observed in HIV-positive men are supportive of continuing evaluation of this drug.",

Extrapolation to higher doses, up to the intended maximum of 80 mg, strongly suggests the possibility of once-weekly use, although such extrapolations are based on data from only 3 subjects. For comparison, enfuvirtide requires administration of a  90 mg dose twice-daily. The preliminary pharmacodynamic data are also encouraging, with \u22650.5 Log10 reduction in plasma HIV RNA observed in all three participants after a single dose at the lower end (10\u201320 mg) of the intended dose range (10\u201380 mg) (Fig. 3).

Moreover, since for each viral family the fusion proteins, from which the FIs are derived, share the same mechanism of action and display considerable sequence conservation, a cholesterol-conjugated FI for a \u201csentinel virus\u201d would represent the template for all the other viruses within the same family.",
