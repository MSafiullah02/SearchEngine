There were 2 control groups: approximately one third had documented RSV hospitalization in the first year before enrollment (n = 76), and the second group (n = 154) was not hospitalized. All study participants were born prematurely (<36 weeks gestational age) without chronic lung disease and had never received vaccines to prevent RSV. Other exclusion criteria were mechanical ventilation at enrollment, a life expectancy of <6 months, or a known immunodeficiency.",

Analyses compared the prophylaxed group with the combined untreated groups and the nonhospitalized untreated group. Post hoc subgroups of infants were determined on the basis of whether the following were present at baseline: family history of asthma and family history of atopy (asthma, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis) or food allergies. Family was defined as anyone in the immediate family. Analyses were performed within these subgroups. A sample size of 200 infants per group would provide approximately 80% power for a 2-sided, .05-level test to detect as statistically significant a difference in physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing rates when the true rates were 3% for the prophylaxed group and 10% for the untreated controls.

The potential influence of baseline characteristics was explored with multiple logistic regression with covariates for RSV hospitalization history, sex, age at enrollment, gestational age at birth, birth weight, multiple birth status, baseline RSV-neutralizing antibody titers (log2 RSV antibody level), day care attendance, numbers of adults and siblings in the home, number of siblings in day care, presence of a wood-burning stove in the home, and family history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, or food allergies. Time to third physician-diagnosed wheezing episode was analyzed with multivariable Cox proportional hazards models including the covariates listed. For each logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analysis, a forward stepwise selection method was used to determine factors significant at the .15 level; these factors were included in the final model. Only factors significant at the .05 level in the final model were displayed.

Of the 27 centers that enrolled subjects, 13 had subjects discontinue on or before day 730 (2-year cutoff). Sixteen (8.4%) in the palivizumab-treated group versus 21 (9.1%) in the 230 children not receiving palivizumab were discontinued before day 730. This difference was not statistically significant (P = .864). Demographics and baseline characteristics of the groups stratified by absence or presence of family history of atopy or food allergies are presented in Table I, Table II\n, respectively. There were 201 children with no family history of atopy or food allergies and 220 children with a family history of atopy or food allergies who were enrolled in the study. In the subjects with no family history of atopy or food allergies, both untreated groups had significantly more children who were from multiple births, and accordingly there were more siblings than in the palivizumab-treated group (Table I). In those with family history of atopy or food allergies, there were more children in day care in the untreated groups compared to the treated group. In both of these subgroups, the untreated infants had greater mean gestational age and birth weight than the palivizumab-treated infants (Table I, Table II). This was expected because guidelines for palivizumab use favor treatment for smaller, more premature infants. The combined untreated group also had a statistically significantly lower proportion of infants with baseline RSV antibody less than 2log2 compared to the treated group, within the subgroup of infants with no family history of atopy or food allergies.

Our finding of a significant protection in children with no family history of asthma or atopy does suggest that the differences may be explained by an atopic diathesis. Thus, whereas our study was conducted in preterm children, and whereas we recruited almost equivalent numbers of children with an atopic background and a nonatopic background, the COAST Study consisted almost entirely of infants with an atopic background.7 Because we did not examine the effects of rhinovirus infection in early infancy in children in the atopic group, we could not comment on the relationship between early rhinovirus infection and later subsequent asthma. However, the apparent lack of an effect of prevention of RSV in atopic subjects fits in well with the apparent lack of an independent effect of early life RSV seen in the COAST Study.7 The relatively low number of children in our study with a family history of asthma may in part explain the nonsignificant reduction in that group. In the group of children with an atopic family history, however, there was almost the same number of children as with no atopic history. The consistency of our findings in all the subgroups on the basis of the absence of family atopy/allergy history and the increasing protection (at least for the point estimates) as successive atopic backgrounds are removed (from a family history of asthma to family history of atopy or food allergies), despite a lower number of children with no family history of atopy or food allergies, suggest that our observation is real.",

It is possible that some of these children already had recurrent wheezing (3 or more episodes of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing) before that age. When we examined the subgroup of children with no family history of atopy or food allergy with multiple logistic regression, palivizumab treatment reduced the risk of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing by 80%; this was in contrast with palivizumab not having a significant effect in those with such a history. Children with recurrent wheezing in this group may have had recurrent wheezing for several reasons. A minority would have asthma starting early in life, and some would be those with recurrent wheezing after RSV, occurring before enrollment. These would be few, because our definition was 3 or more episodes of recurrent wheezing (in this case, before enrollment). Because subjects were between 2 and 5 years of age at the completion of the study, this may be too early for hereditary allergic factors to exert their effect on wheezing. However, allergic factors may have exerted an effect, because the influence of palivizumab was less apparent in these subjects. The children within the group with the most protection thus probably had no atopic diathesis and would probably not go on to develop asthma in later life.

There were still significant differences between the palivizumab-treated and the nonhospitalized untreated group in those subgroups with no family histories of atopy or food allergies. The logistic regression analysis once again showed that the major factor associated with a reduction in physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing was treatment with palivizumab in those without an atopic diathesis.",

This thesis is supported in part by our observation in the Cox regression model clearly showing that in those with an atopic diathesis or food allergies, the family history of asthma is still the strongest predictor of recurrent wheezing later, and prevention by palivizumab of RSV does not appear to have any significant effect in this population. This study shows a protective effect of 65% in the overall population and 80% in those with no background of atopy or food allergies, and the consistency of the effect appears to be a strong indicator that RSV may lead to recurrent wheezing in this population. Whether this effect persists into later childhood or into adult life is a question that remains to be answered.",

This hypothesis was suggested by data from a mouse model of infection and supported by a study of RSV prophylaxis in human beings. In the mouse model of RSV infection, it has been shown that respiratory infections of young mice sensitize the mice to aeroallergens to which they were exposed during infection.20 However, a more recent study suggests that remodeling after RSV in the mouse model occurs without sensitization.21 In a previous study using RSV immunoglobulin,22 it was suggested that the combined immunosuppressive effect of high doses of monthly prophylactic immunoglobulin and the anti-RSV activity of the RSV immunoglobulin given to children with chronic lung disease of prematurity abrogated the development of abnormal lung function at 7 to 9 years of age. Future studies (randomized control trials) of RSV infection using mAbs in children with and without an atopic background are being planned to address the role of RSV in the development of subsequent asthma.",
