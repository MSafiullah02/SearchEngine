Nursing education in India is limited to medical hospitals and is routinely taught by medical doctors. Thereby, nurses do not get any exposure to dental/maxillofacial procedures. The Indian Nursing Council also does not have a syllabus designed for nursing students that includes dental/maxillofacial education. So when a patient is admitted for maxillofacial care, because of very limited understanding, lack of skills and knowledge pertaining to maxillofacial diseases, nurses feel helpless, and ultimately the entire care of the patient is either pushed to the maxillofacial surgeon or is ignored.",

The location and pattern of the fractures are determined by the type of injury and the direction of impact. In addition, patient\u2019s age and the presence of teeth have a direct effect on the characteristic pattern of such injuries [1]. The incidence of maxillofacial injuries is on the rise due to the increase in the number of motor vehicle accidents. Road traffic accident (RTA) remains the most common cause of such injuries [2\u20134]. Maxillofacial injuries are unique because of the anatomical complexity of the area and their associated psychological effects [1].",

An understanding of the cause of injury is important for several reasons. It helps to focus on the need for injury prevention. It may help to identify typical patterns of injury (e.g., the blow to the symphysis associated with a condylar fracture or head injury), and it may raise awareness of the risk of future injuries (for example, in cases of domestic violence) [5]. There are many unique features of injuries of the face because it is responsible for the senses of sight, smell, taste, and hearing [5]. In addition, eating, drinking, speech, and communication through facial expression depend on the integrity of maxillofacial structures. Disruption of the maxillofacial skeleton can also put airway at risk leading to respiratory emergency. In those with maxillofacial injuries, it is even necessary to consider the possibility that there may be an injury to the base of the skull, cranial vault, brain, the cervical spine or the upper aerodigestive tract [5, 6].",

Alcohol is an important factor in these accidents. Population-based data and studies on road traffic injuries in India are insufficient, and further research is needed.

Maxillofacial injuries are very commonly seen cases in the emergency room setups [16]. This is the reason why it is cardinal to provide quick assistance to the specialist in treating such patients. This also accounts for nurses being trained and well informed about procedures being performed by the specialist so that they can quickly prepare when encountering one. When asked during the survey only 5% responded correctly demonstrating that either they have not seen maxillofacial injuries in the emergency room or never assisted one.",

Dental plaque predominates on the subgingival and supragingival surfaces of teeth, but without mechanical elimination, it can cover the entire tooth surface. In a recent systematic review, Scannapieco et al. identified 11 clinical studies demonstrating a significant association between periodontal disease and the occurrence of nosocomial infections. Elderly, institutionalized, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients or intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at higher risk of periodontal colonization by nosocomial pathogens, because of difficulties in oral hygiene, changes in salivary properties, and reduction in anaerobic flora [8\u201310]. Genuit et al. studied the effect of a prophylactic chlorhexidine oral rinse in 95 surgical ICU patients, compared with historical controls. They showed that the addition of oral care to a protocol of weaning from mechanical ventilation led to a significant reduction in late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) [18]. It is critical for nurses in ICU to provide adequate oral hygiene care to the patient to reduce the nosocomial infection-related morbidity and mortality. To assess their awareness about this, we asked them that what care you will take to reduce the probability of nosocomial infections, and only 22.5% gave the correct response, while others think that there is no special care is required and it is not the job of the nursing staff.",
