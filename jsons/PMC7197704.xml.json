The full power of evolutionary methods to model mutation rates and phylogenetic correlations is therefore unused. This may be because evolutionary models relating multiple sequences, using an arbitary phylogeny, are more complicated than consensus models, which effectively assume a star-shaped phylogeny (with the consensus sequence at the centre of the star). Nonetheless, there has been some progress in implementing stochastic evolutionary models for multiple sequence alignment and profiling (Mitchison and Durbin, 1995; Hein et al., 2000; Hein, 2001; Holmes and Bruno, 2001; Holmes and Rubin, 2002; Holmes, 2003; Mikl\u00f3s et al., 2004). To develop this work further, a natural step is to extend the probabilistic results used for HMMs and SCFGs to the evolutionary domain.",

As with all EM algorithms, this algorithm proceeds by repeated application of an E-step followed by an M-step. During the E-step, limited information about the inferred evolutionary history is gathered in the form of certain \u2018sufficient statistics\u2019, which are then used during the M-step to improve the estimate of the rate parameters.

We have implemented the algorithm in freely available software. We show that it accurately and quickly recovers the true indel length on simulated data; in contrast, the \u2018naive\u2019 or \u2018parsimonious\u2019 estimate that associates every observed gap with a single indel event is shown to underestimate the true indel rate by a small amount. Previous ML parameterization approaches have relied on sampling methods, which are significantly slower, albeit less prone to local minima in the likelihood function (Metzler et al., 2001). We report on an application of the algorithm to estimate indel rates in coronavirus proteins.",

For example, it is theoretically possible to do multiple sequence alignment without manually setting scoring parameters; instead, unbiased estimates of these parameters can be obtained quickly, directly and accurately from the data. The algorithms described here can be coupled with a recent \u2018structural EM\u2019 algorithm for the estimation of the ML phylogenetic topology (Friedman et al., 2001). Another application is phylogenetic profiling: previous workers, such as Thorne et al. (1996) have shown that it is possible to partition heterogenous multiple alignments using the varying signature of the substitution process, e.g. to predict secondary structure in proteins or transcription factor binding sites in promoters (Kellis et al., 2003). Using methods based on the TKF model, it is now possible to use similar methods to partition the alignment according to the indel rates, and to estimate the relevant heterogenous rate parameters in an unsupervised fashion, from aligned or unaligned sequences, using EM, exactly as one might do with a single-sequence or pair HMM (Durbin et al., 1998). Thus, this algorithm represents a further step in combining the achievements of HMM-based profiling and evolutionary modelling for multiple-sequence comparative genomics.",

Models that incorporate more realistic length distributions over indel sequences are less tractable than TKF91: such models have been analysed using simulation and combinatoric approximations, but have not yet yielded any algebraic expression for the alignment likelihood (Knudsen and Miyamoto, 2003; Mikl\u00f3s et al., 2004). A tractable alternative is provided by the TKF92 model, which essentially replaces the single residues of TKF91 with artificial, indivisible, multi-residue \u2018fragments\u2019. The lengths of these fragments are geometrically distributed. Where TKF91 is a birth-death process on residues, TKF92 is a birth-death process on fragments.",

On closer investigation, we found that the naive Z estimate deteriorates significantly when \u03bb is much less than \u03bc, and also appears to perform worse at larger timescales. In practise, for long sequences (so \u03bb \u2243 \u03bc) that are closely related (so T is small), the naive estimator for Z may be appropriate, although it seems likely that I and D will still be underestimates.",

We used the alignments containing these inferred ancestral sequences in all subsequent analyses. This strategy is likely to systematically underestimate the true indel rates, since the ML alignment paths will tend to minimize the number of inferred events. Ideally, we should integrate out the ancestral sequences, e.g. by Monte Carlo alignment sampling (Holmes and Bruno, 2001) or multidimensional dynamic programming (Hein, 2001).

Some caution is, however, needed in interpreting these results, because the indel rate estimates depend strongly on the estimated tree. Since we have estimated independent phylogenies (including branch lengths) for the GS1 and GS2 domains, and since the branch length estimates are dominated by the substitutions in the alignment, what we are actually measuring here is not the absolute indel rate but the ratio of the indel rate to the substitution rate.

The results of this test are given in Table 2. Here, it can be seen that the \u2018absolute\u2019 rate of indel evolution is, in fact, greater in GS1. Thus, the overall picture is that GS1 is mutating faster than GS2, but substitutions are elevated relative to indels.

These results seem to indicate that the naive estimates would probably be acceptable in most practical situations, although in order to avoid the possibility of downstream or compounded errors [e.g. in more elaborate TKF91-derived models containing more parameters (Holmes, 2004)] it would be better to use the unbiased estimators derived here.",

Several of these are so closely related to TKF91 that the theory derived here is directly applicable. For example, the TKF92 model (Thorne et al., 1992) (see also Section 2.3) is a birth-death process on sequence fragments, rather than residues, so that the number of matches (a quantity appearing in the expressions for the EM-sufficient statistics) is found by counting the number of aligned fragments rather than the number of aligned residues. Similarly, an evolutionary model for RNA secondary structure has recently been described, together with a recipe for computing the sufficient statistics using the Inside-Outside algorithm (Holmes, 2004). Models that depart more substantially from TKF91, such as \u2018long indel\u2019 models (Knudsen and Miyamoto, 2003; Mikl\u00f3s et al., 2004) and context-sensitive substitution models (Lunter and Hein, 2004; Siepel and Haussler, 2004), have generally not been solved completely (i.e. we still lack exact algebraic expressions for the sequence likelihood) and so the TKF91 theory developed here will be less directly applicable. These models may mandate different approaches to rate estimation, such as enumeration of mutation trajectories (Mikl\u00f3s et al., 2004), truncated Taylor expansions (Lunter and Hein, 2004) and variational approximations (Siepel and Haussler, 2004).",
