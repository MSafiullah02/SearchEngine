[4] [5] [6] Study subjects were consecutively enrolled from March 16 to March 26, 2020. After an overnight fasting and drinking 800 to 1000 mL water and simethicone for gastric dilatation and preparation, the study subject positioned him/herself on the examination bed in Room A (Fig. 1A) , while the operating doctor sat in Room B at the remote control workstation (Fig. 1B) instructing him/her to swallow the capsule via the audiovisual exchange system. After the capsule entered the stomach, the doctor manipulated the 2 joysticks on the remote-control workstation, mobilizing the robotic magnetic arm, and simultaneously driving the precise movement and rotation of the capsule (Video 1).",

The maneuverability of the remote control MCE system was rated as excellent by the doctor (5/5, 100%), and the capsule completely observed the gastric cardia, fundus, body, angulus, antrum, and pylorus in all of the subjects, yielding cardia gastric cancer (n=1), gastric polyps (n=1), gastric erosion (n=1), and normal gastric mucosa (n=2) (Fig. 2) . Study subjects had no discomfort during and after the examination. 2 This provides a novel noncontact (infection-free) diagnostic modality for gastrointestinal diseases (eg, GI bleeding and gastric cancer) during the COVID-19 pandemic for protecting both medical staff (remote controlling, reading, and reporting) and patients (disposable capsule). Of note, signal transmission between rooms could be realized via either cable or fifth-generation (5G) communications. The remote-control endoscopy system could be more generalized to public health emergencies and even disasters where noncontact medicine is warranted. ",
