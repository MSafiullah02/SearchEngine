These techniques add new insights beyond\nconventional ensemble methods by providing dynamic information regarding\nthe biological processes. There are a number of methods used to monitor\nthe mobility of particles including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching\n(FRAP), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and single-particle\ntracking (SPT). FRAP was established in the 1970s to measure the mobility\nof molecules via the recovery speed of fluorescence intensity after\nphotobleaching a given region.34,35 In the same decade,\nFCS was developed to detect and analyze the fluctuations of fluorescence\nintensity caused by fluorescent molecules entering and leaving the\nobservation volume.36 The dynamic parameters,\nsuch as diffusion coefficient and average residence time, could be\nextracted from the autocorrelation analysis.37,38 Strictly speaking, FRAP and FCS measure the average behaviors of\nhundreds or even thousands of molecules, and the geometry of the photobleached\nvolume or the point-spread-function (PSF) of the FCS excitation beam,\nrespectively, needs to be known in detail. These techniques only provide\nlimited dynamic information and do not truly reflect the kinetics\nof biological processes in time and space on the single particle level.\nSPT, however, is capable of monitoring the movements of individual\nmolecules directly by optical microscopy, and it can detect subpopulations\nand event detection changes in diffusional behavior of a single particle.\nHence, the technique is appealing for investigating dynamic events\nin live cells.",

These proteins have been used for tracking the dynamics\nof cellular components in live cells (Figure 9).224,227,228 For example, photoactivated-localization microscopy (PALM), as a\nkind of single molecule-localization super-resolution microscopy,229 mainly relies on the amazing photophysical\nbehaviors of PtFPs. This technique uses sequential activation of fluorophores\nand time-resolved localization to acquire high-resolution images,180,230,231 which has facilitated the investigation\nof the mechanisms of virus infection.232\u2212234 Along with the development\nof SPT and SVT, which have provided subdiffraction resolution already\nin the 1980s, and superresolution microscopy, the combination of SPT\nand PALM (SPT-PALM) has been shown to be capable of visualizing multiple\ntrajectories of viral proteins at high density in live cells.235",

In 1963, Huisgen\nfirst discovered the unactivated azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition\nreaction, but this reaction was ignored for many years owing to the\nharsh experimental conditions.282 The term\n\u201cClick Chemistry\u201d was first put forward by Kolb et al.\nin 1998 and fully described in 2001, where they also introduced Cu(I)\nas a catalyst to realize the azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition reaction\nat room temperature with high chemical yield.283,284 The copper-catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition reaction\n(CuAAC) is the most universal click reaction, but it is often incompatible\nwith living systems due to the potential toxicity of Cu(I). Nowadays,\nthere are several kinds of copper-free azide\u2013alkyne cycloaddition\nreactions reported, such as the strain-promoted azide\u2013alkyne\ncycloaddition (SPAAC),285,286 thiol\u2013ene reaction,287 and strain-promoted inverse-electron-demand\nDiels\u2013Alder cycloaddition (SPIEDAC).288 The copper-free approaches opened up the possibility of labeling\nparticular biomolecules in living systems with click reactions. For\ninstance, to detect DNA synthesis in vivo, a thymidine\nanalogue 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine was incorporated into DNA\nduring DNA replication, and the terminal alkyne group was labeled\nwith a fluorescent azide by a click reaction.289 Similarly, RNA synthesis was detected by using a click\nreaction between a uridine analog 5-ethynyluridine and fluorescent\nazide.290 Researchers have also developed\nan unnatural sugar-based click labeling strategy.291\u2212293 The azido-sugars were added into the cell medium for cell culture.\nAfter metabolism, the azido groups were incorporated into the glycans\non the cell surface, which could be used to bind with fluorophores\nby click chemistry.",

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a conventional nucleic acid recognition\ntechnique, which can be used to detect and localize endogenous or\nengineered DNA or RNA through Watson\u2013Crick base pairing. However,\nFISH is performed in fixed specimens leading to a loss of dynamical\ninformation in comparison to tracking nucleic acids in live cells.\nFor live-cell imaging, fluorescently labeled linear oligonucleotides\nwere developed to visualize nucleic acids and allow investigations\nof trafficking or transient interactions. Using this hybridization\napproach, Molenaar et al. detected various endogenous nuclear RNAs\nin live cells without interfering with cell vitality.356 Often, hybridization techniques suffer from\na high level of background fluorescence due to the lack of effective\napproaches to remove unbounded probes. Here, using nucleic hairpin\nstructures with a fluorescence quencher has been developed to minimize\nthe background fluorescence from nonbound beacons. Upon binding to\nthe target nucleic acid sequence, the hairpin opens and the fluorescence\nsignal increases. One such approach uses fluorescence resonance energy\ntransfer (FRET) to quench the fluorescence signal of the donor and\nthus to significantly reduce the background fluorescence. Using FRET,\na series of QD-labeled molecular beacons were developed with controllable\nQD valency. A nanobeacon with one conjugated DNA was favorable for\nlabeling and imaging single RNA in live cells and was used for ultrasensitive\ndetection of single HIV RNAs in HIV integrated cells.357",

            "text": "In 1956, E. J. Ambrose\nfirst proposed the idea to illuminate cells that contact a glass surface\nby using total internal reflection. Total internal reflection fluorescence\n(TIRF) microscopy was first realized by Daniel Axelrod at the beginning\nof the 1980s.371 The basic principle of\nTIRF microscopy is to use an evanescent wave to excite the sample\nnear the glass\u2013liquid interface. An evanescent wave is generated\nat the glass\u2013liquid interface where the excitation light impinges\non the glass-sample interface above the critical angle, at which point\nthe light cannot physically propagate into the sample (typically buffer)\nand is thus totally reflected. The evanescent wave is a nonpropagating\nwave whose intensity decays exponentially with distance from the interface.372\u2212374 There are two main approaches to producing TIR excitation at the\nglass\u2013sample interface (Figure 21). The original approach, prism-based TIRF,\nutilizes an optical prism to couple the excitation light to the upper\nsurface of the glass (typically quartz)\u2013sample interface. Upon\nthe development of objectives with a numerical aperture above 1.4,\nit became possible to focus light onto the coverslip\u2013sample\ninterface such that the incident beam reaches the glass\u2013sample\ninterface above the critical angle, creating an evanescent field.375 When using an inverted microscope, objective-type\nTIRF leaves the sample above the objective free and is thus more convenient\nand easier to use. Objective-type TIRF is the common modality used\nfor live-cell imaging.376\u2212379",

            "text": "Marvin Minsky\ndeveloped and patented the concept of confocal microscopy in the late\n1950s with the aim of performing microscopy in thick tissues such\nas the brain. The basic principle of confocal microscopy is to use\npoint illumination and a pinhole before the detector to eliminate\nthe out-of-focus signals. For details regarding confocal microscopy,\nwe refer the readers to ref (383). The excitation pinhole and the detection pinhole are both\nmounted in image planes of the microscope, thus \u201ccon-focal\u201d.\nIn this way, only the fluorescence from the focal plane reaches the\ndetector. This microscopy modality has a thinner depth of field and\nhigher resolution compared to wide-field microscopy. One of the demands\nthat Minsky had on confocal microscopy is that it could image in real\ntime, which, according to Minsky, may have significantly delayed the\nacceptance of confocal microscopy.384 Shortly\nafter the development of the confocal microscope, lasers were invented.\nLasers had high enough energy densities to perform confocal microscopy\nand, as light coming from the laser is collimated, an excitation pinhole\nwas no longer needed. In addition to the laser, the development of\ncomputers and imaging software contributed to the rapid development\nof confocal microscopy and became commercially available in the late\n1980s. There are two types of confocal microscopes (Figure 23).385 The laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) scans the sample point-by-point.\nThe sample can be scanned, typically using a piezo stage, or the excitation\nbeam can be scanned using galvanometer mirrors (and nowadays also\nwith resonant scanners) that can be used to increase the scanning\nspeed. In either case, data is collected one pixel at a time and,\neven when the scanners have sufficient speed for imaging, one is often\nlimited by the number of photons available per pixel. Thus, the typical\nimage speed of a LSCM is limited to a couple of images per second\nand not suitable to track the dynamic behavior of quickly moving biomolecules\nin live cells. The second approach is to scan multiple volumes simultaneously,\nand a first apparatus was already built in the late 1960s.386 This is done using a Nipkow disk and is referred\nto as spinning-disk confocal microscopy (SDCM).385 The sample can be excited by multiple points simultaneously\nin the focal plane and an area detector such as an EMCCD can be used\nto collect the detected signals. SDCM and similar approaches can significantly\nimprove the imaging speed. Thus, SDCM has become an indispensable\ntool for investigating the dynamic events of biomolecules in live\ncells. Furthermore, combining SDCM with a fast piezo z-scan device\nallows recording of fast three-dimensional images and has been used\nfor 3D single-virus tracking in live cells.387,388",

Since\nsingle-particle experiments are extremely sensitive to background\nfluorescence and photobleaching, optical sectioning schemes such as\nTIRF and confocal microscopy have already been widely used for single-particle\ntracking in live cells. Owing to the limited imaging depth of TIRF,\nit is not suitable for single-particle tracking in extended 3D samples.\nConfocal microscopy has limitations in speed when used for 3D volumetric\nimaging. In addition, a good portion of the sample is always illuminated\nduring confocal microscopy leading to photobleaching of the sample\neven out of the focal plane. To avoid this difficulty and to allow\nSVT in large biological objects in three dimensions, light sheet microscopy\nhas been introduced. In light sheet microscopy (LSM), a focused thin\nplan of light is used to illuminate the sample and the emission light\nis collected orthogonally with a standard microscope objective and\nimaged.389\u2212391 The 3D volumetric image can be obtained\nby moving the coaligned excitation and detection plane relative to\nthe sample.392 Thus, compared with confocal\nmicroscopy, LSM is able to image thicker tissues (>1 cm) and has\nalready\nsuccessfully been utilized to image complex organisms at single-cell\nresolution in three dimensions, e.g. embryos of C. elegans, zebrafish, Drosophila, and even mouse embryos.393\u2212396 In addition, the plane that is illuminated by the light sheet is\nin the focal plane for detection and out-of-focus regions are not\nilluminated.",

Enderlein in 2000 to monitor fluorescent molecules motilities\nwithin a 2D membrane421 and first realized\nin 2D and 3D by Gratton et al. in 2003.57 In the orbital tracking approach, the laser beam is orbited in a\ncircular path around the fluorescent particle. When the particle is\nin the center of the orbit, the fluorescence intensity will stay constant\nthroughout the orbit. When the molecule moves from the center of the\norbit, the fluorescence signal will modulate with the orbit and the\nx-y position can be obtained from the phase and the modulation of\nthe periodic fluorescence signal using a fast Fourier transform.422 For determining the z-position of the fluorescent\nparticle, the difference is taken of the fluorescence intensity between\ntwo different z-planes separated by approximately half the axial width\nof the point-spread function. The localization method is fast and\ncan be utilized in a fast feedback mechanism where the orbit is recentered\non the fluorescent particle and the location of the particle is written\nto disk. Thus, this approach allows us to track individual particles\nin three dimensions in real time.58,423,424 The orbiting tracking system was used to monitor\nthe assembly and egress of the matrix protein of Ebola virus.

First of all, it\nhas a very high spatial and temporal resolution (2\u201350 nm and\n1\u201332 ms). Second, the fast Fourier transform as the localization\nalgorithm is not sensitive to background noise and a single particle\ncan be tracked in a scattering environment, although with a slightly\nlower precision. The main drawback of the orbital tracking approach\nis that it is not suitable to simultaneously tracking multiple particles\nin live cells. When particles are moving slowly, multiplexing can\nbe performed, but in general, the approach only tracks one particle\nat one time. Thus, this approach is not convenient for collecting\na high amount of statistics for rare events. On the other hand, as\none is following the particle, one has the ability to measure various\nproperties of that particle (e.g., spectra or lifetime427) or to photoactivate or manipulate that particle.\nIn addition, the trajectory is written directly to disk in real time,\nwhich allows one to skip analysis steps 6.1 and 6.2 in the following\nsection.",

For example, by visualizing the interaction between\nthe capsid of CPV and transferrin receptors on the cell surfaces,\nit became apparent that the interactions facilitate trapping of the\nviral capsid into clathrin-mediated endocytic structures by a rapid\ndiffusion-based mechanism (Figure 30).142 By tracking the infection\nbehaviors of influenza virus in living cells, the entry of influenza\nvirus followed two distinct pathways: a clathrin-mediated pathway,\nand a clathrin- and caveolae-independent pathway.72 Simultaneous tracking of viruses and clathrin-coated pits\nindicate that most viruses promote the de novo formation\nof clathrin-coated pits around the viruses and exploit the clathrin-mediated\npathway for virus internalization. In parallel, the remaining viruses\nenter the host cells by a clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytic\npathway with similar efficiency.

The evolution and development of SVT\nin the past decades shed light on the mechanisms involved in the life-cycle\nof a variety of viruses including virus internalization, virus transport,\ngenome delivery, and virus assembly. As an interdisciplinary technique,\nSVT required consecutive efforts from experts in chemistry, biology,\nvirology, and physics. With the development of new fluorescent tags,\nbetter labeling strategies, and novel optical instruments, SVT is\ncontinuously undergoing rapid expansion. In this review, we have given\npractical considerations of how to perform SVT experiments in live\ncells, including the choice of fluorescent tags, labeling strategies,\nimaging instrumentation, and data analysis, and have demonstrated\nthe power of SVT by mentioning a few applications.",

            "text": "SVT has been\nestablished nearly two decades ago, and this booming\ntechnique shows no signs of slowing down. However, there are still\nseveral issues that need to be ironed out for SVT in the future. First\nof all, the sizes of different kinds of viruses (10\u2013300 nm)\nvary largely and fluorescent tags may impair the virus infectivity\nin varying degrees. To reduce the influence of fluorescent labeling,\nonly a limited amount of fluorescent tags can be used to attach to\nthe viral components. New organic dyes and FPs with better photophysical\nproperties are being developed and will contribute to improve SVT.\nEven so, monitoring the viral infection processes continuously with\nhigh temporal resolution over the entire infection process remains\na big challenge. QDs, with their excellent optical brightness and\nphotostability, are a great option and have the potential of tracking\nthe whole infection process of individual viruses in living cells.\nHowever, QDs also have some limitations such as their larger size,\nphotoblinking, and potential interference with the functionality of\nthe virus. Fortunately, in many cases, QDs have been shown to have\nminimal influence on the virus characteristics and do not affect the\nviral infectivity, although to what extent QDs labeling may affect\nthe real behavior of viruses in living cells is unclear. SVT will\ncertainly profit from the development of new-types of QDs with small\nsize and nonblinking to circumvent these limitations.497\u2212499 Smaller QDs will also most likely minimize any deleterious effects\nof the labeling process.",
