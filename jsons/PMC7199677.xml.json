Mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be below 1%, 2 mainly due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction. Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 received less medical attention; nevertheless, the first cases of myocarditis in COVID-19 patients have been reported.3, 4, 5, 6 Moreover, myocarditis was recognized as the cause of death in some COVID-19 patients.7 Pathology is usually focal within the myocardium, but there is a risk of arrhythmia, as well as progression to fulminant heart failure and cardiogenic shock. This article outlines the possible pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis, its clinical presentation, as well as the associated arrhythmias. The criteria for screening and management of myocarditis relating to COVID-19 are also proposed.",

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) appears to be the central mediator of cytokine storm where it orchestrates the pro-inflammatory responses from immune cells including the T-lymphocytes.11 This causes T-lymphocyte activation and a further release of inflammatory cytokines which stimulate more T-lymphocytes, leading to a positive feedback loop of immune activation and myocardial damage. Cardiotropism of the T-lymphocytes is thought to arise from the interaction between the heart-produced hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and c-Met, a HGF receptor on na\u00efve T-lymphocytes.12\n",

Nakagawa et al.\n18 demonstrated that MERS-CoV-\u03944a, a mutant MERS-CoV strain which lacks the 4a accessory protein, had less efficient replication in the HeLa/CD26 cells compared to the wildtype MERS-CoV. It is thought that the 4a accessory protein inhibits protein kinase R-mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2.18 Failure to phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 impairs stress granule formation. The stress granules help sequester the host proteins important for translation and attenuate viral protein syntheses; therefore, its suppression promotes viral replication. Similarly, SARS-CoV enhances its RNA translation via the Nsp1 protein.19\n",

This is partly because the early reports often lacked the specific diagnostic modalities to assess myocarditis. Some argued that up to 7% of the COVID-19-related deaths were attributable to myocarditis;26 however, this was assumed and not based on a confirmatory diagnosis of myocarditis and may be an overestimate. On the other hand, many laboratories are rationing tests and first screening for known pathogens resulting in flu-like symptoms. If a positive pathogen is identified, then testing for SARS-CoV-2 is not performed. This is erroneous and likely to miss the true frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection as it assumes mutual exclusivity of SARS-CoV-2. One report has identified 24.5% of COVID-19 patients to have co-infection with other viruses.27 Hence, it is possible that many cases of COVID-19-related myocarditis were missed due to a lack of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.",

One observational study of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China reported a 7.3% incidence of heart palpitations among its 137 patients.30 Moreover, Wang et al.\n31 reported that arrhythmia was a cause of ICU transfer in 44.4% of COVID-19 patients. Caution is encouraged when interpreting these data as the sample size tends to be small and hence prone to overestimation. The exact nature of the arrhythmias was also not usually reported, rendering it difficult to assess whether they are secondary to other conditions such as electrolyte imbalance or pre-existing arrhythmias. The actual prevalence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients; therefore, remains unknown. Nevertheless, arrhythmias could occur in the context of myocarditis. Peretto et al.\n32 reported in a recent study that 78.7% of myocarditis patients exhibited some forms of ventricular arrhythmias. The characteristics of arrhythmias also differ between the active and healed myocarditis,32 suggesting that the pathophysiology is dependent on the stage of myocardial injury.",

Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 could occur in the acute setting while scenario 4 and 5 occur in chronic or healed myocarditis. Regarding the fifth scenario, it was shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. IL-6, might cause the displacement of plakoglobin, a desmosomal protein, from the cardiomyocyte membrane.35 This could be arrhythmogenic as inadequate cell-to-cell adherence is postulated to damage the cell membrane, leading to cardiac cell death and fibrofatty replacement.36 Moreover, reduced surface expression of desmosomal proteins is a known etiology of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies.36 Substantial evidence has now suggested an increase in serum IL-6 in COVID-19 patients, especially in those with severe presentations.37 It is, therefore, plausible that SARS-CoV-2 infection precipitates arrhythmias in patients with a genetic predisposition. Clinicians should be vigilant for arrhythmias, especially in the areas where both the COVID-19 burden and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy prevalence are high e.g. the North-Eastern (Veneto) part of Italy.36\n",

We encourage testing the patients for the baseline cardiac enzymes e.g. troponin and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) on hospital admissions, as the cardiac troponin I (cTnI), cTnT, NT-proBNP and BNP are usually elevated in myocarditis due to the acute myocardial injury and possible ventricular dilatation. Elevations of both troponin and NT-proBNP were observed in the COVID-19-related myocarditis cases.3, 4, 5, 6 Although negative troponin cannot exclude myocarditis, particularly for the atypical forms such as giant cell myocarditis or for those in the chronic phase, negative serial high sensitivity cardiac troponin is still helpful in the acute phase and makes acute myocarditis significantly less likely.

            "text": "The American Heart Association (AHA)10 recommends further testing for the patients with signs consistent with myocarditis with one or more cardiac imaging such as an echocardiogram or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Because it is portable, an echocardiogram is usually more readily deployed. Especially under time and resource constraints, devices such as the hand-held, point-of-care ultrasound can be advantageous in terms of accessibility and the relative ease to disinfect the device for infection control. The cardinal signs of myocarditis on echocardiogram comprise increased wall thickness, chamber dilatation, and pericardial effusion in the background of ventricular systolic dysfunction. Whilst CMR offers major imaging advantages over echocardiography, it is limited by out-of-hours availability, the requirement for some breath-holding, slower throughput, and, given high contagiousness of COVID-19, the requirement for deep cleaning after use. Where possible to perform CMR, the results should be interpreted according to the revised Lake Louise consensus criteria:43 (A) edema; (B) irreversible cell injury; and (C) hyperemia or capillary leak. Figures 3A-3F demonstrate the typical CMR findings of myocarditis. The CMR myocardial edema and/or scarring were observed in all of the SARS-CoV-2 related myocarditis cases where CMR results were reported.4, 5, 6 Where CMR is proven prohibitive, cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan with contrast enhancement and ECG-gating is an effective alternative, especially when the patient is to undertake the high-resolution CT scan of the chest for assessment of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (Figure 3J). Contrast-enhanced cardiac CT will add very little scanning time, and it is particularly useful in this situation to perform a test rapidly with minimal requirement for breath-holding.44 Without the CMR or contrast-enhanced CT results, it is arduous to distinguish myocarditis from other differential diagnoses.",

(2020)3 and Hu et al. (2020)48 reported the use of corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin. A recent meta-analysis 49 on corticosteroid and intravenous immunoglobulin used in pediatric myocarditis concluded that the intravenous immunoglobulin may improve the ventricular systolic function but failed to find the support for corticosteroid use. However, immunosuppression might pose a risk for more severe clinical disease, especially when there is active viral replication. Therefore, it is reasonable to withhold or minimize the use of immunosuppression in SARS-CoV-2 patients, especially in the setting of a positive viral genome on EMB. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, is now being tested in a multi-center randomized-controlled trial which recruits COVID-19 patients with raised IL-6.50 This might be beneficial in the setting of cytokine storm syndrome and help reduce myocardial inflammation.",

            "text": "Several cases of coronavirus-related myocarditis have been reported. Its pathophysiology is likely a combination of the direct viral insult to cardiomyocytes and the human\u2019s immune response to virally infected myocardium. Simple bedside tests such as serial ECG and cardiac biomarkers can raise suspicion of acute-onset cardiac symptoms. Particular attention should be given to the biomarkers changes or trends and not just a reading in isolation. Cardiac imaging techniques such as echocardiography and CMR can be used to aid diagnosis; however, distinguishing between differentials of stress-induced cardiomyopathy, sepsis-related cardiomyopathy and acute coronary syndrome can be difficult. An invasive coronary angiogram will often be warranted, especially in older patients. The definitive diagnosis of myocarditis is obtained via EMB and if performing an invasive catheterization, adding an EMB would add little time and no additional risk of infection spread vs. catheterization alone. For patients who cannot undergo CMR, the contrast-enhanced cardiac CT is a swift, reproducible, precise and reliable alternative which can be added to the sequences for high-resolution CT of the lungs to evaluate the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Initial treatment for fulminant myocarditis should follow the cardiogenic shock protocol which includes the use of inotropes or vasopressors and mechanical ventilation. Arrhythmias can be managed by temporary cardiac pacing or anti-arrhythmic medications. Then, depending on severity, the patient may require mechanical circulatory support. Cautions must be taken for the use of the NSAIDs and QTc-prolonging drugs in COVID-19 patients as these medications might exacerbate the cardiac symptoms.",

Intracellular SARS-CoV-2 might impair stress granule formation via its accessory protein. Without the stress granules, the virus is allowed to replicate and damage the cell. Na\u00efve T-lymphocytes can be primed for the viral antigens via antigen-presenting cells and cardiotropism by the heart-produced hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The HGF binds c-Met, a HGF receptor on the T-lymphocytes. The primed CD8+ T-lymphocytes migrate to the cardiomyocytes and cause myocardial inflammation through cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In the cytokine storm syndrome, where pro-inflammatory cytokines are released into the circulation, T-lymphocyte activation is augmented and releases more cytokines. This results in a positive-feedback loop of immune activation and myocardial damage.
