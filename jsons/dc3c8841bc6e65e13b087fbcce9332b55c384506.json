[ 11 ] However, fast/ultrafast PCR is highly desirable for applications such as time-sensitive diagnosis of infectious diseases, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and sepsis at the point-ofcare (POC) level, because fast therapeutic turnaround time (TAT) decreases not only the mortality rate but also the severe risk of unknowingly transmitting the disease to others.

[ 11, 14 ] These systems are excellent equipment in research laboratory; however, they are not suitable for POC testing due to their high power consumption (800-1000 W maximum) and heavy weight (more than 20 kg). In resource-limited environments such as in developing countries or fi eld laboratories, we need a portable, robust, simple, and fast PCR, which is easy to use with low power through miniaturization and integration. [ 15, 16 ] In order to meet these requirements, integrated microfl uidic approaches for fast/ultrafast PCR systems have been extensively studied to reduce amplifi cation time by decreasing sample volume (i.e., thermal mass), which allows for fast heat transfer and, thus, faster thermal cycling with less power consumption. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] The most commonly used method for static microfl uidic PCR thermal cycling is resistive heating with microfabricated thin fi lm heaters and a resistance temperature detector (RTD). [ 19, 20 ] In this design, the PCR runs in the microfl uidic chamber above resistive thin fi lm heaters. While the power consumption is relatively low in this method, it requires a complicated fabrication process to integrate the thin fi lm heater and RTD on the same chip. Peltier heat block technology is also widely used for both static and continuous-fl ow PCR due to its rapid heating and cooling rates, but this technology also requires higher power consumption. [ 21, 22 ] In continuous-fl ow PCR, PCR amplifi cation occurs when the reaction samples pass through discrete temperature zones. [ 23, 24 ] This method can produce faster thermal cycling than can static PCR, but it requires an external syringe pump for fl ow control and lacks the capability to change the number of cycles. Another approach includes infrared (IR)-mediated noncontact selective heating of the PCR mixture for PCR thermal cycling using an IR laser or fi lament lamp, which harnesses water's strong IR absorbance property at wavelengths greater than 1000 nm. [ 25, 26 ] However, as the volume of the PCR mixture increases from nanoliter to microliter, the total thermal cycling time also increases from \u22485 to \u224840 min.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 207, "end": 212, "text": "[ 11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 213, "end": 217, "text": "14 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 636, "end": 641, "text": "[ 15,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 642, "end": 646, "text": "16 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 960, "end": 964, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 965, "end": 969, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 970, "end": 974, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 975, "end": 979, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 980, "end": 984, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 985, "end": 989, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 990, "end": 994, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 995, "end": 999, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1004, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1014, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1201, "text": "[ 19,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1206, "text": "20 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1670, "text": "[ 21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1675, "text": "22 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1794, "end": 1799, "text": "[ 23,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1804, "text": "24 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2243, "text": "[ 25,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2248, "text": "26 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recent outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Middle"}, {"text": "Recently, the plasmonic photothermal heating of gold (Au) nanoparticles (AuNPs) using a pulsed or continuous-wave laser has been widely investigated for the photothermal therapy of cancer and fast PCR. [ 27, 28 ] However, this arrangement is not ideal for POC testing, because it not only requires expensive lasers but also lacks reliable AuNP-based sample preparation. More recently, we have introduced a novel ultrafast photonic PCR method that combines a thin Au fi lm as a plasmonic photothermal light-to-heat converter and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a heat source. [ 29 ] In comparison to AuNPs-based fast PCR, the plasmonic photothermal heating of microfabricated Au thin fi lm for ultrafast photonic PCR has many advantages since microfabrication technology can provide precise geometrical controls, accurate thin fi lm thickness process, enabling novel integrated devices, and reproducible microdevices. In this method, the 120 nm thick Au fi lm on the bottom of the reaction well generates heat due to its strong absorption of the light from a 3 W blue LED, resulting in the heating of the surrounding solution to 150 \u00b0C within 3 min, as well as the ultrafast completion of 30 thermal cycles within 5 min. While this method is promising for POC diagnostics due to its ultrafast thermal cycling ability, low power consumption, and simple confi guration for system integration, we need to improve its relatively low amplifi cation effi ciency. In order to accomplish accurate and reliable PCR-based diagnostics, we have to solve the issues of temperature gradient in the PCR mixture caused by heating only on one side and the reliable positioning of the thermocouple for temperature control.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 202, "end": 207, "text": "[ 27,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 208, "end": 212, "text": "28 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 575, "end": 581, "text": "[ 29 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recent outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases, such as Ebola and Middle"}, {"text": "Here, we present a novel LED-driven optical cavity PCR for accurate, fast, and reliable POC diagnostics. By employing an optical cavity consisting of two thin Au fi lms for evenly absorbed light, the temperature uniformity of the PCR mixture is greatly improved, showing a temperature difference of less than 2 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C and 0.2 \u00b0C at 68 \u00b0C. Depending on the PCR reaction volume from 1.3 to 10 \u00b5L, 30 thermal cycles from 94 \u00b0C to 68 \u00b0C can be accomplished within 4-10 min. The temperature variations during 30 thermal cycles are below 1 \u00b0C for both 94 \u00b0C and 68 \u00b0C, showing precision temperature controllability. Nucleic acids (c-MET cDNA) at concentrations as low as 10 \u22128 ng \u00b5L \u22121 (two copies per \u00b5L) were successfully amplifi ed using the LED-driven optical cavity PCR, with high repeatability and reproducibility. We propose that this PCR method is suitable for POC platforms because it shows excellent reliability and reproducibility and is capable of fast thermal cycling with amplifi cation effi ciency comparable to that of commercial benchtop PCR systems. Figure 1 a shows a schematic of light absorption in the optical cavity PCR for nucleic acid amplifi cation with PCR. The optical cavity comprises two thin Au fi lms on the top (denoted as Au fi lm 2 in Figure 1 a) and bottom (denoted as Au fi lm 1 in Figure 1 a) of the PCR cavity, both of which were deposited on a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sheet. The two Au fi lms act as a plasmonic photothermal light-to-heat converter for PCR thermal cycling, as previously reported. [ 29 ] When the LED is illuminated, the emitted light is refl ected, absorbed, and transmitted to Au fi lm 1 . Subsequently, the transmitted light is also refl ected, absorbed, and transmitted to Au fi lm 2 . The refl ected light on Au fi lm 2 exhibits multiple refl ections, absorptions, and transmissions in the optical cavity. Based on this model, the total absorption of Au fi lm 1 . First, the average transmittance, refl ectance, and absorbance of thin Au fi lms over the emission wavelength of the LED was calculated from the measured absorption spectra of thin Au fi lms with different thicknesses and based on the emission spectrum of the LED ( Figure S1 and were calculated for different combinations of top and bottom Au thicknesses, as shown in Table 1 . The combination of a 10 nm thick Au fi lm 1 and a 120 nm thick Au fi lm 2 was optimal for both the absorption ratio (1.06) and the total absorption of light (70%); hence, these values were used as the thicknesses of the thin Au fi lms for the optical cavity PCR chamber. For the nucleic acid amplifi cation through PCR, thermal cycling, consisting of two or three discrete temperatures for denaturation, annealing, and extension can be achieved by simply turning on and off the heat source LED (Figure 1 b ). Figure 1 d shows a schematic of the LED-driven optical cavity PCR. A reference chamber with a type-K thermocouple was placed next to the optical cavity PCR chamber. The reference and cavity PCR chambers were designed to be covered by the beam waist ( \u00f8 12 mm) at the focal length to ensure that both chambers receive the same intensity of light so that photothermal heating occurs at the same rate. Both chambers were placed at the focal length of the lens (25 mm from the top surface of the lens) for the highest light absorption. The photograph for the experimental setup of the LED-driven optical cavity PCR can be found in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 a-d shows the calculated temperature distribution inside the 750 \u00b5m thick PCR chamber for bottom-only and cavity (top and bottom) heating at 94 \u00b0C (for denaturation) and 68 \u00b0C (for annealing/extension). It is clear that cavity heating provides a more uniform temperature distribution compared with bottom-only heating, especially at 94 \u00b0C. The temperature gradients across the height of the chamber (along the white arrow) are plotted in Figure 2 e. The cavity heating shows better temperature uniformity, with a difference of only 1.9 \u00b0C and 0.2 \u00b0C compared to the temperature difference of 14.4 \u00b0C and 0.4 \u00b0C for bottom-only heating at 94 \u00b0C and 68 \u00b0C, respectively. The effect of the PCR chamber height on the temperature uniformity was also investigated, as shown in Figure 2 f. As the height of the PCR chamber decreases, the temperature difference ( \u0394T = T max \u2212 T min ) across the height of the chamber decreases for both the bottom-only and cavity heating confi gurations because heat transfer can be more effective in the smaller volume of a thinner PCR chamber. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the cavity heating shows signifi cantly smaller temperature differences for all chamber heights at both the denaturation and annealing/extension temperatures. Therefore, employing cavity heating allows for uniform heating of the PCR mixture for effi cient and reliable nucleic acid amplifi cation. Figure 3 a shows the representative temperature profi le for 30 PCR thermal cycles from 94 \u00b0C to 68 \u00b0C using the LEDdriven optical cavity for different chamber heights. The total time to achieve 30 PCR cycles decreases as the cavity height decreases, attaining the minimum time (average 235.5 s) with a 100 \u00b5m thick cavity PCR chamber, which shows good linearity with an adjusted R 2 value of 0.9899, as shown in Figure 3 b ( Figure S4 , Supporting Information, for the total time in the case of bottom-only heating). Using the thermal cycling result, heating and cooling rates were calculated as previously described. [ 28, 29 ] The average rates during 30 PCR cycles and sample standard deviations were obtained, as shown in Figure 3 c. The fastest heating and cooling rates of 7.50 \u00b1 0.46 \u00b0C and 6.35 \u00b1 0.49 \u00b0C s \u22121 were obtained from the 100 \u00b5m thick PCR chamber. The maximum and minimum temperatures attained during each PCR cycle varied within less than 1 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C and less than 0.5 \u00b0C at 68 \u00b0C, showing comparable temperature accuracy to commercially available benchtop thermal cyclers. In particular, due to the lower heat mass as well as fast heat transfer between the thin Au fi lm and the PCR mixture through a 50 nm thick SiO 2 layer, the overshoot and undershoot for the cavity PCR were very low (0.85 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C, 0.25 \u00b0C at 68 \u00b0C) compared to the benchtop thermal cycler (\u22482 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C, \u22484 \u00b0C at 68 \u00b0C) when fast cycling was performed because the benchtop thermal cycler is not designed for fast thermal cycling ( Figure S5 , Supporting Information).

Healthcare Mater. 2016, 5, 167-174 www.advhealthmat.de www.MaterialsViews.com reference chamber with a type-K thermocouple was placed at both positions and thermal cycling was performed. Figure 3 e shows a comparison of the temperature profi les during thermal cycling between positions 1 and 2. From this fi gure, it can clearly be observed that both positions received the same intensity of light from the LED for the photothermal heating of thin Au fi lms ( Figure S6 , Supporting Information).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2243, "end": 2248, "text": "[ 28,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2249, "end": 2253, "text": "29 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 173, "end": 182, "text": "Figure S3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 210, "end": 218, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 657, "end": 665, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 990, "end": 998, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1624, "end": 1632, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2037, "end": 2045, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2059, "text": "Figure S4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2359, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3157, "end": 3166, "text": "Figure S5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3338, "end": 3372, "text": "Healthcare Mater. 2016, 5, 167-174", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3525, "end": 3533, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3799, "end": 3808, "text": "Figure S6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Simulation for the Temperature Uniformity of Optical Cavity PCR"}, {"text": "To verify our LED-driven optical cavity PCR method, we demonstrated the amplifi cation of nucleic acids (c-MET cDNA, lung cancer biomarker). Figure 4 a shows an image of the 2% agarose gel from the benchtop thermal cycler (Bio-Rad C1000 thermal cycler with CFX96 real-time PCR detection system) and the cavity PCR (750 \u00b5m thick PCR chamber) with different cycle numbers from 95 \u00b0C to 68 \u00b0C. For the benchtop PCR, a three-step thermal cycling protocol recommended by the manufacturer was used ( Figure S7 , Supporting Information). It is clear that as the cycle number is increased, the intensity of the band increases for the cavity PCR. The cavity PCR with a different chamber height (200, 400, and 750 \u00b5m thicknesses) was performed as shown in Figure 4 b. For the comparison, the same volume of PCR byproducts from different chamber heights was used for gel electrophoresis as diluted to 20 \u00b5L volume due to the small PCR sample volume for the 200 \u00b5m thick cavity chamber. It is noteworthy that the gel intensity from the 200 \u00b5m thick cavity PCR chamber is low, and this may be attributed to the faster cycling time and subsequently lower amplifi cation effi ciency. By optimizing the PCR reagents, the amplifi cation effi ciency can be further improved. The total reaction times for both the benchtop and cavity PCR are summarized in Figure 4 c. A reduction of 70%-85% in total reaction time can be obtained using cavity PCR, although the total reaction times for the KAPA2G Fast PCR kit are already 20%-70% shorter than for the conventional PCR assay. Figure 4 d shows the 2% agarose gel image from the cavity PCR with different initial concentrations of template DNA. There is a clear trend in the change in band intensity as the concentration changes. Furthermore, 40 cycles of cavity PCR were able to amplify as low as 10 \u22128 ng \u00b5L \u22121 (two copies per \u00b5L \u22121 ) within 15 min. We also successfully amplifi ed the c-MET cDNA prepared from nonsmall cell lung cancer cell (NSCLC, H1975) to show the utility of the optical cavity PCR method for the heterogeneous biological samples as shown in Figure 4 e. In addition to its fast and sensitive nucleic acid amplifi cation, the cavity PCR is highly repeatable and reproducible. The cavity PCR was performed in series with different concentration of template DNA as shown in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. The success rate of the cavity PCR with different concentrations of initial template DNA is plotted in Figure 4 f to show the excellent repeatability and reproducibility of the cavity PCR method. The success rate for extremely low concentrations can be further improved with a mass-manufactured cavity PCR chamber. The cavity PCR was also successfully operated by minimally trained undergraduate students ( Figure S9 , Supporting Information). The demonstration of the robust LED-driven optical cavity PCR indicates that this method is an ideal candidate for implementation into POC platforms that require fast, accurate, and reliable nucleic acid amplifi cation. The optical cavity PCR used in this study was effective in not only fast PCR thermal cycling but also reliable nucleic acid amplifi cation, yielding results comparable to the conventional benchtop PCR system. Providing the test results within 30 min is necessary to make a single visit to the POC viable. [ 11 ] Our cavity PCR can meet this requirement because it can accomplish 30 PCR thermal cycles within 4-10 min and can amplify nucleic acid concentrations as low as 10 \u22128 ng \u00b5L \u22121 (two copies per \u00b5L) within 15 min. By optimizing the thickness of the thin Au fi lms of the cavity, light absorption can be uniformly absorbed at the top and bottom thin Au layers of the cavity, resulting in excellent temperature uniformity with a difference of only 1.9 \u00b0C and 0.2 \u00b0C at 94 \u00b0C and 68 \u00b0C, respectively. As a result, cavity PCR shows excellent repeatability and reproducibility due to its excellent temperature uniformity and precise temperature accuracy. In general, the faster the thermal cycling is driven, the greater the variation of the temperature across the PCR sample will be, due to thermal inertia. [ 11 ] However, in the optical cavity PCR, there is not a signifi cant difference in the temperature accuracy with different sample volumes, ranging from 1.3 to 10 \u00b5L. This could be due to not only the low thermal mass but also the fast heat transfer between the thin Au fi lm and the PCR mixture through the ultrathin 50 nm thick SiO 2 passivation layer. At present, the power consumption for heating is relatively high (\u224820 W) compared to previous work (\u22483 W) [ 29 ] because seven LEDs on a single PCB were chosen to have a wide beam waist for heating the reference and cavity PCR chambers at the same rate. However, by using two 3 W LEDs for each reference and cavity PCR chamber, the power consumption could be further reduced (\u22486 W). Our current efforts are focused on real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using fl uorescent detection as well as integrating multiple wells to allow for high-throughput multiplexed amplifi cation. Although the gel electrophoresis is considered as one of the gold standards for the analysis of PCR byproduct from conventional PCR, the result would not be completely quantitative, and additional steps are required. Therefore, the fl uorescent detection for the real-time qPCR is highly required, and we are investigating the real-time optical cavity PCR method for quantitative analysis. For the high-throughput multiplexed amplifi cation, a LED array for the simultaneous heating of multiple wells can be used, but this also can increase the power consumption. To challenge the power consumption issue for multiple wells applications, optimization for the size of the cavity PCR chamber and uniform light distribution from the LED array to ensure simultaneous heating of multiple wells should be considered as our future work.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3332, "end": 3338, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 4138, "end": 4144, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 4600, "end": 4606, "text": "[ 29 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 141, "end": 149, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 494, "end": 503, "text": "Figure S7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 746, "end": 754, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1345, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1564, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2101, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2322, "end": 2331, "text": "Figure S8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2466, "end": 2474, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2770, "end": 2779, "text": "Figure S9", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Nucleic Acid Amplifi cation Using Optical Cavity PCR"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we demonstrated a fast and reliable optical cavity PCR method for nucleic acid amplifi cation.
