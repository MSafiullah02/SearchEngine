Here we show that HeV infection in a population of Pteropus conspicillatus is likely to be endemic rather than episodic, as previously proposed for HeV in flying-foxes. We also present evidence for seasonal viral activity suggesting that immunity to the virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis. These findings should inform disease risk management and approaches for modelling henipavirus infection in bat populations. If the ongoing threat that these viruses pose to public health is to be mitigated, further work is required to clarify the principal mode(s) of transmission of henipaviruses in bats, and to comprehensively determine how these viruses persist in their reservoir hosts.",

It has been permanently occupied by Pteropus conspicillatus for at least ten years, usually containing 40,000 to 60,000 individuals, constituting approximately 20% of the Australian population of this threatened species [18], [28]. This is the closest known flying-fox colony to the property where the HeV spillover event occurred in October 2004 [5]. The Australian population of P. conspicillatus is geographically isolated from other populations of this species in northern Papua New Guinea and the Moluccan islands of Indonesia [29].",

The strength of evidence for alternative models was measured by AICc weights (\u03c9i). For the potential risk factors identified by multivariate logistic regression to be important in explaining variation in serostatus, we performed log binomial regression analyses to further analyse their associations with serostatus. The relative risk of being seropositive was determined for these predictor variables. Due to the smaller sample sizes, Fisher's exact test was used to investigate the hypothesised effect of reproductive status on serostatus in adult females, where serostatus of non-reproductive adult females was compared with those categorised as either pregnant, early lactation or late lactation.",
