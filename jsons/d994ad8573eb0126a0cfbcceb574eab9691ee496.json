Although ACE2 is known to be expressed in many organs, whether it is expressed by the conjunctival tissue is largely unknown. Human conjunctival tissues from 68 subjects were obtained, which included 10 subjects with conjunctival nevi, 20 subjects with conjunctivitis, 9 subjects with conjunctival papilloma, 16 subjects with conjunctival cyst, 7 subjects with conjunctival polyps, and 6 ocular traumas as normal subjects. Expression of ACE2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot assay. We observed the expression of ACE2 by conjunctival tissues, expecially in conjunctival epithelial cells. ACE2 was significantly (p<0.001) overexpressed in conjunctival cells obtained from subjects with conjunctivitis, conjunctival nevi, conjunctival papilloma, conjunctival cyst, and conjunctival polyps epithelial cells when compared to that in conjunctival epithelial cells obtained from control subjects. Collectively, clinical features of reported COVID-19 patients combined with our results indicate that COVID-19 is likely to be transmitted through the conjunctiva.",

The primers used were as follows: ACE2-forward, 5\u2032-AAAGGAACAGTCCACACTTGCCC-3\u2032, and ACE2-reverse, 5\u2032-TGAAGACCCATTTTGCTGAAGAGCC-3\u2032.",

[22] performed a prospective interventional case study series to assess the presence of novel coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of COVID-19-infected patients. They report that conjunctival swab samples collected from patients with conjunctivitis yielded positive RT-PCR results, whereas negative RT-PCR results were obtained for the tear fluid and conjunctival secretion samples in patients without conjunctivitis. In our study, a marked immunostaining revealed that ACE2 was abundantly expressed in epithelial cells in patients with conjunctivitis as compared to that in the epithelial cells from normal conjunctivae. This could explain why some studies reported positive RT-PCR results only in patients with conjunctivitis.",
