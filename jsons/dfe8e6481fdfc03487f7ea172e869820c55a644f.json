Room surfaces in the vicinity of COVID-19 symptomatic patients and clinician's protection equipment were found to be contaminated. 1 The primary strategy for COVID-19 patients is supportive care, including oxygen therapy for hypoxemic patients, in which high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was reported as effective in improving oxygenation. Among patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFNC was proven to avoid intubation compared to conventional oxygen device. 2,3 However, there is an important concern that HFNC may increase bio-aerosol dispersion in the environment due to the high gas flow used. The increased dispersion might favor transmission of infectious agents (such as COVID-19) carried in aerosol droplets generated by the infected patient. This concern is reflected in the limited use of HFNC in the first clinical study reporting 21 patients with COVID-19 in Washington State, where only one patient used HFNC. 4 In contrast, a broad utilization was observed in the study by Yang and colleagues from Wuhan, China where 33 out of 52 ICU patients were treated with HFNC. 5 There appears to be an uncertainty and a trend to avoid HFNC among COVID-19 patients in the western world, thus increasing early intubation rates and potentially associated harms such as sedation and prolonged intensive care unit stay but also intubation procedures per se which represent a high risk situation for viral exposure. Early intubation increases the demand for ventilators, contributing to the critical shortage reported worldwide. Avoiding or delaying invasive mechanical ventilation could substantially reduce immediate demand for ventilators. Thus, we aimed to discuss the scientific evidence supporting the risk of HFNC induced bio-aerosol dispersion in the COVID-19 context.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 357, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1160, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1317, "end": 1318, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The utilization of smoke (an aerosol of solid particles < 1 \u00b5m) simulation via a manikin model by Hui et al 6, 7 provides a direct visualization of exhaled smoke dispersion.
