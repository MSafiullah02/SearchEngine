We define a zoonotic reservoir as one or more epidemiologically connected animal populations and/or environments where a pathogen can be maintained and transmitted to humans (Haydon et al. 2002) and, more broadly, domestic animals as well. Regardless of transmission mode, the process by which a pathogen moves from one host population (or environmental reservoir) to another host population is referred to as spillover and arises from complex bidirectional interactions among people, animals, pathogen communities, and environments. This is a key step in zoonotic disease emergence but remains poorly understood and often not explicitly quantified in transmission models (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2009; Iacono et al. 2016) , which tend to focus on dynamics within a single population. Some of the most significant quantitative work at the spillover interface has focused not on predicting rates of zoonotic spillover but on identifying and predicting the common features of spillover diseases and the pathways they tend to exploit. Viruses have been best studied in this context; basic rules of thumb are well established, such that single-stranded RNA viruses are predisposed to become zoonoses, likely due to a predisposition toward evolvability and host switching. Other rules have emerged from studying the networks of viral transmission between different host groups and humans. For example, a study by Johnson et al. (2015) demonstrated a number of key rules, perhaps most importantly that viruses with greater host plasticity in animal reservoirs are more likely to demonstrate human-tohuman transmissibility. Some virus families, such as arenaviruses and filoviruses, are predisposed to human-to-human transmission. Correspondingly, some groups of mammals were especially common reservoirs of zoonotic viruses, including rodents (especially for arena-and bunyaviruses), primates (retroviruses), and bats (paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses). Pathways of spillover were also noted to differ, with bush meat hunting being a notable source of exposure to nonhuman primate viruses, while proximity of homes to fields was a significant driver for exposure to rodent-borne viruses (Dearing and Dizney 2010) .

Olival et al. confirmed that viruses with arthropod vectors have a greater plasticity in their mammalian hosts and showed that viral replication in the cytoplasm also predicts zoonotic potential.

It is the active steps of emergence (exposure, contact, invasion, and onward transmission), influenced by host-pathogen evolutionary processes, that ultimately determine the outcome of interactions among entities. In short, spillover and emergence are stochastic processes with outcomes that depend on the probabilities of the occurrence of underlying events. As we will make clear, the variability associated with spillover and emergence is large because the size of groups involved (vis-\u00e0-vis number of infected individuals) is small and hence subjects to the vagaries of sampling: it is only after sufficiently many of these events have been observed that we can begin to meaningfully characterize spillover and emergence in terms of expected rates of pathogen transmission. Using our framework, three key processes are delineated that determine (1) the occurrence of pathogen spillover from reservoirs either to an intermediary or directly to a focal host; (2) the occurrence of primary transmission from an intermediary to a focal host, when intermediary hosts play a role (which is in most cases); and (3) the occurrence of secondary focal hostto-host transmission required for true disease emergence in the focal host. We use the term true emergence to contrast with the observation of multiple focal host cases of an infectious disease arising exclusively from spillover (Antia et al. 2003) .

Each of these compartments in the model is influenced by various factors and interactions (e.g., factors which influence the state of the host, pathogen, and environment and the resultant interactions; see Table 8 .1 for examples), as well as the processes of sourcehost contact, intensity and duration of exposure, pathogen invasion potential for individual hosts (i.e., interactions between pathogens and the immune system), and onward transmission and adaptation within host populations. We find it insightful to Fig. 8 .1 Conceptual model of the process of pathogen spillover and emergence. The ellipses represent three conceptual components: reservoir (RC, either environmental or wildlife populations serving as an ecological system in which the pathogen is endemically maintained), intermediary host/vector (IHC) population that serves to transfer the pathogen from the reservoir to the focal host, and focal host (FHC), generally human or species of special concern (e.g., domestic or highly threatened species). The dotted lines represent three spillover boundaries between RC-FHC (SB1 direct transmission route), RC-IHC (SB2), and IHC-FHC (SB3) (the concatenation of these latter two constitutes the indirect transmission route) consider pathogen spillover as typically involving four conceptually distinct, transmission processes: spillover from the reservoir component (RC) directly to the focal host component (FHC) (i.e., spillover boundary 1, SB1), spillover from the RC to the intermediary host/vector component (IHC) (i.e., spillover boundary 2, SB2), spillover from the IHC to the FHC (i.e., spillover boundary 3, SB3), and host-to-host transmission within the FHC itself. Direct transmission across SB1 occurs between focal susceptible individuals and either individuals from reservoir species, the environment, or fomites (e.g., infected intermediary host fecal material or carcasses). Transmission across SB2 often presents an important bottleneck to pathogens ultimately entering FHC. Transmission Non-synonymous changes in the spike gene are found in viruses with sustained human-to-human transmission. These genetic changes are not found in viruses circulating in the reservoir host (palm civets) or spillover viruses that did not successfully move to the host epidemic space where sustained human-to-human transmission occurs (Pepin et al. 2010) across SB3 is generally the focal spillover process, particularly those vectored by mosquitoes and parasites.

In some cases, pathogens may routinely spillover without resulting in any onward transmission in the FHC. In this case, the novel host is a dead end, and the epidemic is purely driven by spillover events. In humans, we see examples of this with anthrax and rabies. Once a spillover proceeds to include direct focal host-to-host transmission, if R 0 < 1, the process ends in a transmission chain that has a geometric distribution with an expected length of (1 \u00c0 1/R 0 ) (distribution of chains that arise from several such transmission events is referred to as stuttering chains, Antia et al. 2003 ).

Finally, once secondary transmission has been identified in the FHC, then contact tracing can also be used to construct next-generation distributions where estimates of R 0 can be developed. Only if R 0 > 1 can an outbreak occur, and even then if R 0 > 1 is close to 1, epidemic fade-out may be more likely than an epidemic outbreak (Parrish et al. 2008; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 395, "end": 413, "text": "(Duffy et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1373, "text": "(Parrish et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1398, "text": "Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FHC Empirical Elements"}, {"text": "The quantity R 0 is often considered the most important element studied in epidemiology, providing critical insight into epidemic behavior (Heesterbeek 2002) .

In a full FHC epidemic with eventual fade-out, host factors themselves may drive the process through changes in contact behavior, treatment, and/or other interventions that reduce R 0 , leading to fade-out and cessation of the epidemic. For example, interventions such as quarantining infected individuals limited the SARS outbreak in China in 2003 to fewer than 10,000 cases, even though the international travel of infected individuals puts hundreds of millions of individuals at risk (Smith 2006) . Alternatively, the pathogen may establish itself in the new host population, sustained by secondary transmission, leading ultimately to endemic infection (e.g., HIV/AIDS; see below) or eventual epidemic fade-out. In the latter case, the pathogen cannot persist in the population as might happen, for example, when the proportion of susceptible individuals has been greatly reduced by the action of the epidemic itself [e.g., 1918 influenza pandemic, \"the Spanish flu\" (Taubenberger and Morens 2006) ].

This is the case for all human diseases that have clear origins in wildlife populations. For example, non-synonymous changes in the Spike gene were found only in SARS viruses where sustained human-to-human transmission occurred. These genetic changes were not found in viruses circulating in the reservoir host (palm civets; Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) or in those spillover viruses that did not successfully move to the FHC where sustained human-to-human transmission occurred (Pepin et al. 2010) .

For example, in diseases such as rabies (Zinsstag et al. 2009 ) and brucellosis (Zinsstag et al. 2005) , where R 0 in humans is zero, we often find calculations of R 0 developed for reservoir populations, without any explicit quantitative consideration of the magnitude of spillover into the FHC. This is also seen in a recent paper that explicitly models dog-to-human transmission for rabies (Zinsstag et al. 2009 ), including the development of clinical disease in both human and dog populations. R 0 is calculated for dog-to-dog transmission in IHC, but no specification of spillover rates across SB3 is made. This tells us that there is sustained transmission in the dog population, prior to any introduction of interventions; but the estimated dog-tohuman contact rate is never used to provide an explicit corresponding estimation of the size of the spillover event. In the context of vector-borne diseases, a similarly approached assessment can be found with Plasmodium knowlesi transmission from monkeys to humans through Anopheles leucosphyrus mosquitoes, an interesting example of spillover (Cox-Singh and Singh 2008). A recent model of this system (Yakob et al. 2010 ) could be usefully extended to include the elaboration of spillover values: monkeys to humans and humans back to monkeys, in both cases through mosquitoes.

This threshold may disappear when frequency-dependent transmission predominates (Getz and Pickering 1983) , as is the case for sexually transmitted diseases. Establishment of the pathogen will only occur if the necessary threshold density of susceptible individuals is identified and is required to ensure that R 0 ! 1; otherwise, failing to have the necessary density of susceptibles, the pathogen will fade out with R 0 < 1. Disease control or eradication efforts are then focused on using this threshold principle to manipulate pathogen fadeout in the new host population through the reduction of susceptibles as, for example, with H1N1 and the use of vaccination and school closures to control the outbreak. However, R 0 and H T do not apply to transmission across spillover boundaries SB1 and SB3 where primary transmission of zoonotic disease occurs. These concepts are, by definition, only applicable to the transmission within the reservoir or spillover host populations themselves. Further, spillover and onward transmission differ in an important respect: spillover is a series of onetime events, while onward transmission can either lead to stuttering chains, involving small groups of individuals from the animal and human populations interacting in the FHC, or full-blown outbreaks. Consequently, relative to time, the accumulation of spillover events is a linear process coupled to the nonlinear exponential processes of transmission in the reservoir and spillover host populations (Fig. 8.2) .

Many emerging zoonotic pathogens present as a spillover epidemic only in the human population with R 0 \u00bc 0 (e.g., anthrax) or a mixed epidemic type where there is spillover with highly inefficient human-to-human transmission (R 0 < 1 in the human host, e.g., Fig. 8.2 Mixed epidemic dynamics (a) shows spillover and onward transmission in a mixed epidemic (spillover epidemic and host epidemic).

The appropriate interventions and surveillance methods for the two processes are different monkeypox virus). The immediate focus of control for many emerging zoonoses is not the reduction of infectious animals in the reservoir populations (the reservoir species may not even be known) but minimizing human behaviors and other factors that are thought to contribute to pathogen exposure and invasion risk in humans (e.g., Ebola; see below).

For example, zoonotic pathogen transmission at SB1 or SB3 will be spatially restricted in occurrence to where the RC or IHC species and humans intersect. In contrast, once a pathogen has evolved and adapted to the human host niche (FHC), the pathogen is freed from this spatial restriction. This moves the outbreak from being described principally by ecological variables such as host range or environment (e.g., Ebola, anthrax) to an outbreak described principally by socioculturally shaped transmission dynamics (e.g., HIV). A caveat here is the movement of infected animal products in the form of bush meat, which can expand the spatial restrictions in spillover also driven by sociocultural influences (Alexander et al. 2012a ). The movement of bush meat is a growing concern in the public health and agricultural sectors. Our framework identifies important gaps in the quantitative evaluation of the zoonotic outbreaks by identifying the need to link together the concatenated stochastic processes of spillover (SB1-3) and onward transmission in the FHC. The real problem, however, of characterizing transmission spillover boundaries is that sample sizes are rather small and observations are only partial: we may have some observations of successful spillovers (e.g., Ebola outbreaks over the past 40 years), but we have no idea how many infected animal-susceptible human contact events actually occurred. Further, during the early stages of a zoonotic outbreak, we do not have data that provides what proportion of transmission events took place across SB1 and SB3 versus that occurring within the FHC. For example, a hunter may be infected with Ebola virus from eating infected gorilla meat (Fig. 8.4 ). This infected individual may then go on to infect four other people in his family that care for him. Alternatively, five people in this family may handle and eat the meat of an infected gorilla directly and become infected, with no human-to-human transmission occurring. In both cases, five In (b), there is only a spillover epidemic with no FHC (R 0 \u00bc 0). Insets c and d illustrate Ebola outbreaks in Gabon (Georges et al. 1999) where both spillover types individuals are infected, but in the first case, two separate parameters must be estimated to predict the pathogen emergence process (transmission rates in both the spillover and the FHC), while in the second case, only the transmission rate in the FHC is needed, given that a spillover event has occurred. It is possible that genetic data may allow us to differentiate between these two cases, though we will need to know something about the rates of Ebola virus strain evolution within animal and humans hosts, respectively. In the second case, however, estimating the probability that isolated spillover events occur over time requires long-term samples of outbreak rates and the assumption of stationary conditions (i.e., the environmental and human population factors involved remain unchanged over time). While the temporal dynamics of these two cases would be different, in a mixed ongoing epidemic, characterization and application of how the two stochastic processes, one at the spillover boundary and one in the FHC, are intertwined are essential to gaining the necessary insight into the outbreak etiology and efficacy of different management actions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 839, "end": 862, "text": "(Alexander et al. 2012a", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2253, "end": 2274, "text": "(Georges et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1832, "end": 1841, "text": "(Fig. 8.4", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Evaluating the Framework"}, {"text": "Explicitly integrating the separate stochastic processes of spillover and onward transmission facilitates consideration of new questions that are not routinely discussed in emerging infectious disease literature.

Emphasis is given to the possibility that some spillovers will stutter to extinction even though we may have R 0 >> 1 in the human population. Conversely, some spillovers with R 0 < 1 in the human population will, nevertheless, lead to outbreaks sustained by continuous transmission from animal to human spillover. When the public health focus is on the pathogen, not the strain (as in influenza), we can then consider the case of multiple spillovers of different strains with a distribution of R 0 in the human population.

Different framings of the relative importance of those processes lend themselves to different corresponding mathematical formulations, such as self-correcting Poisson processes or-if random variation in \u03bb is stochastic enough to be important to model accuracy-a Poisson-gamma mixture with feedback. In their model, the force of infection is expressed as a combination of zoonotic and human-to-human components: where S H is the susceptible human population size; Pr R and Pr H are the prevalence of infected rodents and humans, respectively; N H and N R are population sizes of humans and rodents, respectively; and \u03c7 R is a parameter that represents \"the ability of the reservoir to excrete a suitable dosage of the virus and the human response to it\" (with a corresponding \u03c7 H for human-to-human transmission). In their application to Lassa fever, the authors show that the flexibility of this model produces dramatic responses to subtle changes. For example, moving from a constant rate of spillover to a seasonally peaking process (as a mode of hypothesis testing) reduces humanto-human contributions to outbreaks from roughly 90% to 20%. With expanding accuracy in models of the spillover process, simulation methods have now begun to be developed that appropriately predict spatial risk patterns for Lassa fever. A study by Redding et al. (2016) combined a (simpler) model of RC: FHC transmission (\u03bb, which they term the \"force of zoonotic infection\") with habitat suitability modeling for reservoir hosts to develop an \"environmental-mechanistic zoonotic spillover model.\" Models like these, which consider spatial variation in human-reservoir contact and spillover risk, represent a tremendous advancement in the quantification of the spillover interface. Most spatial patterns in zoonotic disease emergence are currently studied with more correlative methods like ecological niche models, which are tremendously powerful but subject to a number of user-end decisions, only relate patterns of occurrence to environmental variables (transmission risk rather than transmission rates), and suffer from problems relating to lack of consensus among conflicting models.
