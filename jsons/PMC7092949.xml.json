Equimolar mixtures of HR-N and HR-C peptides (100 \u03bcM each) were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, to facilitate the HR-N/HR-C complex formation. After incubation, the CD spectroscopic profile of the HR-N/HR-C complex shows a typical \u03b1-helix structure with double minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 2\n). Regarding the thermal stability, the HR-N and HR-C mixture exhibited the formation of a very stable complex.

The CD spectra of the refolded HR-N/HR-C complex were also recorded after the heat-denaturation experiment. The helical contents of these peptides and complex were estimated as the following average percentage by the CDPro program [13]: 29.7% for HR-N + HR-C (calculated); 62.4% for HR-N/HR-C (observed); and 56.5% for HR-N/HR-C (refolded).

The combination of equimolar amounts of HR-N and HR-C gives rise to the disappearance of the individual bands and the formation of new bands at the intermediate positions corresponding to the complex. Additionally, complex formation was also observed with the HR-N/HR-C (1:10) but without complete disappearance of the individual HR-C component. Therefore, the two sets of data, CD and PAGE, strongly suggest that HR-N/HR-C form a stable helical complex derived from the key region of interaction and agree with the previous reports of the post-fusion states of type-I viral protein fusion core. Some interesting phenomenon was observed on the native PAGE gel. Beside the major bands, smearing bands appear in the lanes of either HR-C or HR-N/HR-C which may be caused by the equilibrium between the ordered and disordered HR-C peptides. Furthermore, the various combinations of HR-N and HR-C (HR-N homotrimer, HR-N/HR-C heterodimer, trimer of the HR-N/HR-C heterodimer, and HR-N/HR-C complex with dynamic equilibrium of HR-C release) could form several major bands on the native 4\u201312% gradient gel (Fig. 3\nA).",

Prior to data collection, crystals were mounted in a cryoloop and the reservoir solution with addition of 5% PEG200 was used as a cryoprotectant. Initially, due to the fact that the unit cell is nearly orthorhombic, attempts were made to process the data sets by the space group of P222 and P2. However, the results were not acceptable. Finally, the crystals were determined to belong to the triclinic space group P1 with unit-cell parameters a\n = 50.99 \u00c5, b\n = 58.40 \u00c5, c\n = 76.03 \u00c5, and \u03b1\n = 90.52\u00b0, \u03b2\n = 89.99\u00b0, \u03b1\n = 89.98\u00b0 as well as unit-cell volume of 226,382 \u00c53. The data were collected to 2.98 \u00c5 resolution with the statistics as the following: 36,316 for number of observations; 28,326 for unique reflections; 94.7% for completeness; 8.7% for R\nmerge; and 10.6 I for average I/\u03c3. The self-rotation function maps revealed three perpendicular 2-fold axes and a 3-fold axis (data not shown). These non-crystallographic symmetries suggest that the SN50/SC40 complex forms three-helical bundles whose long axis is approximately parallel to the crystallographic c-axis, and there are probably four such trimeric assemblies in an asymmetric unit related by pseudo-222 symmetry. This prediction is further justified by calculating the Matthews coefficient V\nm\n[14], which is 1.91 \u00c53/Da by assuming 4 timers of HR-N/HR-C in an asymmetric unit with a solvent content of about 35%.",

The result revealed that the anti-S2 antibodies could recognize HR-N better than HR-C, suggesting a greater immunogenicity for the HR-N region.

Thus, we could confidently build a homology model of the HR-N and HR-C association based on the X-ray crystal structure of the MHV spike core formed between the N-peptides and C-peptides. HR-N peptides possessed a typical triple coiled-coil structure as shown by the red ribbons in Fig. 4\nB. Half of HR-C (blue ribbons) had an \u03b1-helical conformation with the exception of an extended coil in the middle of the structure. Surface map representation shows the presence of the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of three central HR-N helices. Three HR-C helices pack against the hydrophobic groove in an anti-parallel manner. The extended coil region packs against the shallow groove, but the helical region of HR-C packs against the deep groove (Fig. 4C). The sequences between SARS-CoV and MHV share 66% and 54% similarity (56% and 28% identity) in the aligned HR-N and HR-C regions, respectively. The residues at the \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d positions in the HR-N and HR-C regions are hydrophobic (Fig. 4A). The complex structure derived from superimposing with the MHV crystal structure also shows that there are hydrophobic interactions between these two peptides (Fig. 4C). Before the crystal structure of SARS spike fusion core is solved, this homology model could be used as the guide for searching the inhibitory ligands through virtual docking screen technique.",

The fusion mechanism has been well studied and revealed that the HR-N/HR-C six helix bundle formation is important for the viral entry [4]. If small, oral, bioavailable molecules that disrupt the formation of HR-N/HR-C complex could be identified, they may be developed into effective drugs against viral infection. The first goal of this project was to solve the HR-N/HR-C complex structure. The 3D structure of the spike fusion core will be helpful for rational drug design or virtual screening by docking program in anti-SARS therapy.",

Molecular replacement searches were carried out with models from MHV fusion core (PDB code: 1WDF) and other viral families, including the crystal structure of paramyxovirus SV5 fusion protein core (PDB code: 1SVF) [18] and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) fusion protein core (PDB code: 1G5C) [19].
