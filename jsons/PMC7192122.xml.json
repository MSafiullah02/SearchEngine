Current research has found that this indicator is related to COVID-19 severe cases (Guan et al., 2020). SAA is another non-specific indicator for the early stage of infection, mainly but not limited to viral diseases (Zhang et al., 2019). The association between this indicator and the COVID-19 has not been reported (Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b). In this study, both CRP and SAA showed trends of increase along with the worsing of severity.
