The drug development process, from novel compound screening to final approval, can take more than 10 years to complete and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. By contrast, viruses can emerge rapidly, spread widely, and pose a substantial, immediate threat to public health. For example, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first reported in November, 2012, and, as of September, 2014, cases have been reported in 21 countries, with 837 confirmed cases and 319 deaths.",

Therefore, ribavirin is thought to introduce hypermutation into RNA replication products by random incorporation of uracil and cytosine. Ribavirin has been shown to have some efficacy for treatment of respiratory syncytial virus4 and haemorrhagic fever viruses\u2014eg, hantavirus5 and Lassa fever virus.6\n",

They note enhanced survival 28 days after diagnosis in patients who received ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa-2a, but this enhanced survival was not statistically significant (p=0\u00b7054). The investigators acknowledge that the sample size in the study was small (44 patients; 20 who received treatment and 24 control patients) and a small sample might affect the statistics in a complex population. Therefore, the data for 28 days after diagnosis have value as a guideline and might be statistically significant in a larger sample of patients.",

This study takes advantage of the relatively large number of patients with MERS-CoV being treated at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Saudi Arabia, to make some important initial observations on the use of ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa-2a combination therapy. In any outbreak situation, time to treatment is crucial, and the number of patients needed to undertake large-scale clinical trials might be too small while the pathogen is still rare. By contrast, the initial stages of an outbreak are often the most important for stopping the spread of the pathogen, therefore smaller studies such as this have a very important role as a guide for future clinical trials.",
