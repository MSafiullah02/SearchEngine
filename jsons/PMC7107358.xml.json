First, we demonstrated that immunofluorescence analysis using virus-infected cells will, if performed alone rather than as part of a set of analyses, return false-positive MERS-CoV antibody results for a fraction of patients. Of note, IFA is considered a highly robust assay because of the possibility to inspect the specific fluorescence staining patterns in virus-infected cells, providing an additional diagnostic criterion that is not available in other serology formats, such as enzyme immunoassays (EIA). The same propensity for false-positive results is therefore to be expected with EIA that use full virus as the test antigen. Future studies should take this into account to avoid any false-positive end points. Exact delineation of specific antigenic epitopes within the MERS-CoV spike protein, which could then be used as a recombinant antigen in EIA, could be useful in the development of a more-reliable protocol for serological detection of MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "Second, we found no significant rates of antibodies against MERS-CoV in individuals living in the Jeddah and Makkah regions. However, the number of samples analyzed in this preliminary study is limited, making it impossible from a statistical perspective to exclude the presence of antibodies in the population. Furthermore, although we know that IFA will readily detect antibodies in clinically severe cases of MERS-CoV infection, it is conceivable that lower levels of antibodies could exist in mild or asymptomatic cases. Nevertheless, we believe that our data suggest that long-term circulation of MERS-CoV at the population level is not occurring in the area from which our target population was sampled. The population should therefore be largely susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Of note, the investigated geographical area overlaps with the destination for the Hajj and the Umrah, where millions of pilgrims gather each year and respiratory viruses are known to be acquired and transmitted at high rates [11, 12]. The absence of antibodies in our study is consistent with the absence of reports of any MERS-CoV infection in pilgrims returning from the Hajj in 2012 [11, 13].",
