            "text": "Most polysaccharides possessing antitumor activity are not only nontoxic, but also have some other bioactivities, such as inducing cell differentiation, stimulating hematopoiesis, anti-metastasis [10], anti-angiogenesis [11], and inducing production of nitric oxide (NO) [12]. Most of the polysaccharides do not directly act on tumor cells, but play a role by activating the immune system of an organism: i.e. promoting the maturation, differentiation and reproduction of three kinds of cells (lymphocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells) [13]; simultaneously activating complements and the endothelial system on the endoplasmic reticulum; promoting the generation of a variety of cytokines [14]; and ultimately inhibiting the growth of tumor cells or causing the apoptosis of tumor cells. A lot of polysaccharides possessing antitumor activity have already been found so far, such as \u03b2-glucans which have different planar and three-dimensional structure, pectic polysaccharides, and seaweed polysaccharides. Some polysaccharides, like lentinan [15], [16], polysaccharide from Ganoderma lucidum\n[17], [18], polysaccharide from Coriolus versicolor\n[19] and so on have been formally used in clinic and favored by doctors. Other polysaccharides which are being researched further include Bergenia crassifolia pectin polysaccharide [20], Phellinus linteus polysaccharide [21], Grifola frondosa polysaccharide [22], Panax ginseng polysaccharide [23], Agaricus blazei polysaccharide [24], Antrodia cinnamomea polysaccharide [25], lycium barbarum polysaccharide [26], acetobacter polysaccharide [27] and so on [28], [29]. It is necessary to note that besides \u03b2-glucans, some \u03b1-glucans also possess activity [29], [30].",

Although for now a few polysaccharides which indeed possess cytotoxic activity have been reported [32], [33], i.e. these polysaccharides can directly kill cancer cells not through the immune system mediation, their action mechanism is still not clear and needs further research.",

            "text": "After 1970s, some polysaccharides were found to possess the effects of anti-herpes virus and anti-influenza virus. In particular, in 1980s some polysaccharides were found to possess anti-AIDS virus (HIV) activity [34]. Studies indicated that most of antiviral polysaccharides can interfere the binding of virus surface glycoprotein gp120 to CD4 receptor on the lymphocyte surface [35], and can inhibit the expression of viral antigen, and inhibit the activity of viral reverse transcriptase (RT) [36], [37]. The chemical structures of polysaccharides with antiviral activity mostly contain sulfate radical. The existence and amount of sulfate radical in the polysaccharide directly affect its antiviral activity. For example, lentinan from Lentinus edodes (Berk) has a remarkable anti-tumor effect, whereas its anti-HIV activity is very low. However, sulfated lentinan possesses a significant anti-HIV activity. Similarly, the polysaccharide from sargassum has anti-tumor effect and the sulfated sargassum polysaccharide possesses an obvious anti-herpes virus activity [38]. Many polysaccharides have been reported to possess antiviral activity so far, such as a sulfated galactan having anti-herpes virus activity isolated from red algae in the sea [39], [40], a sulfated fucosan obtained from arabic gum, and a sulfated xylan from green algae etc. They all can selectively inhibit the formation of herpes simplex virus and syncytium [41]. The sulfated K5 Escherichia coli polysaccharide possesses the anti-HIV activity and its structure is similar to heparin, but it has no anticoagulant effect like heparin. This polysaccharide is expected to be developed a candidate drug to prevent HIV transmission in developing countries [42], [43].",

Different from the properties of monosaccharide and oligosaccharide, many polysaccharides do not increase blood sugar. On the contrary, they can decrease blood sugar.

Studies indicated that although some polysaccharides do not increase the insulin secretion in the body, they can significantly improve the activity of glucokinase, hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in liver, also reduce the level of triglyceride and cholesterol in plasma [45]. Some polysaccharides are \u03b2-receptor agonists. They can pass information to mitochondria through the second messenger, which can speed up the glucose oxidation and finally result in the hypoglycemic effect [46]. At present scientists found a number of polysaccharides having hypoglycemic effect, such as polysaccharides from Garuga pinnata\n[47], Artemisia sphaerocephala Krasch [48], Diospyros Kaki\n[49], and so on.",

Pretreatment of the polysaccharides significantly reduced the number of apoptotic neurons revealed by DAPI staining when neurons were exposed to serum-free medium. Besides, the polysaccharides could also decrease the activity of caspase-3 triggered by A\u03b2 peptides. Western blot analysis indicated that polysaccharides stimulated the phosphorylation of PDK-1 (Serine 241) and Akt (Threonine 308). The polysaccharides provide a lead for future development of neuroprotective agent against neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases and the neuroprotective mechanism may primarily rely on activation of Akt survival signaling pathway [62]. Sun et al. [63] reported an exopolysaccharide from a marine fungus for protection of PC12 cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced injury. Chicoine et al. [64] discovered that the polysaccharide DS-L (500-kDa dextran sulfate) elicited neuroprotection in the brain, including enhanced repair responses through the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) axis. Polysaccharides are macromolecules. How can they pass through the blood brain barrier (BBB) to act on the nerve cells? This mechanism is worthy of deep investigation.",

Activated carbon is used to decolorize the extract solution of polysaccharide in practice. However, activated carbon has a strong adsorption for both pigments and polysaccharides. So this point can lead to a big loss for polysaccharide yield. The weakly basic ion exchange resin is also used to decolorize. The resin can remove free pigments in crude polysaccharides, but resin has a strong adsorption to acidic polysaccharides as well. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) method is more frequently used to decolorize crude polysaccharides. The pH of crude polysaccharide aqueous solution (0.3%\u2fff0.8%, w/w) was adjusted to 8.0 using ammonia (NH3\u00b7H2O), and then H2O2 (final concentration is 10%\u2fff30%, v/v) was added gradually at 45 \u00b0C under stirring keeping for 2 h. The resulting mixture was adjusted to pH 7.0 using acetic acid, concentrated and precipitated by ethanol to obtain the decolorized polysaccharides [80], [81]. It is essential to strictly control decolorizing conditions when using H2O2 method, e.g. the concentration of crude polysaccharide solution, temperature, time, pH, etc. Even so, this method still can result in some loss of polysaccharide degradation. Fang et al. [85] invented a novel method of polysaccharide decolorization, which used a kind of reverse micellar solution composed of n-hexanol-CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide)-isooctane to decolorize polysaccharide. This method which has been granted a patent is convenient and rapid. Meanwhile the recovery of polysaccharide is high.",

In practical terms, the concentration of the ploysaccharide mixtures can not be too high, the speed of ethanol adding can not be too fast, and the pH of the solution should be around neutral. The result of purfication is better when the concentration of the polysaccharide solution is smaller and the co-precipitate effect is weaker.

In early stage, the purification of PSK (Polysaccharide Krestin) used this method. The salting-out method is cost-effective, low-efficiency and easy to form co-precipitation [80]. The key factor of affecting the efficiency of salting-out method is the concentration of polysaccharide. The purfication result is better when the concentration of the polysaccharide solution is smaller. The secondary factors are pH value of the solution and salting-out temperature. In order to obtain a satisfactory experimental repeatability, the concentration and pH and temperature of the solution should be all controlled strictly.

According to this property, the coordination compound of quaternary ammonium salt-polysaccharide can be generated in the form of precipitate, then the coordination compound precipitate can be gradually dissociated and eventually dissolved by slowly increasing the ionic strength of the solution to a certain extent. This method is often applied in the separation of acidic polysaccharides and neutral high-MW polysaccharides. The quaternary ammonium salts commonly used are CTAB (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) and CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride) [87], [88]. In the experiment operation, besides controlling the ionic strength of solution, the pH value of solution also must be controlled. The pH value of solution should be less than 9.0 and no sodium tetraborate is present in the solution, otherwise neutral polysaccharides can also precipitate. The quaternary ammonium salt precipitation method has a very good effect. It can precipitate acidic polysaccharides or long chain macropolysaccharides from a very dilute solution (e.g. 0.01% concentration) via selective precipitation. The coordination compounds formed have different solubility in salt solutions with different ionic strength, acid solutions and organic solvents, through which combined polysaccharides can be freed. The coordination compound formed is often dissolved in NaCl solution of 3\u2fff4 mol/L, then polysaccharides will be precipitated by adding 3\u2fff5 times ethanol and the quaternary ammonium salt still stays in the solution; or the coordination compound formed is dissolved in NaCl solution of 3\u2fff4 mol/L, then the quaternary ammonium salt will be precipitated by adding iodide or thiocyanate and the polysaccharides still stay in the solution. n-butanol, pentanol or chloroform and other organic solvents are also used to extract the quaternary ammonium salt-coordination compound solution. Finally, salts are removed by dialysis and the solutions are freeze-dried to obtain the pure polysaccharides. The quaternary ammonium salt precipitation method is a classical method and it is still used in the polysaccharide purification up to now, such as lentinan was once purified using this method in Japan.",

But the disadvantages of this method are low flow rate and long time-consuming. Especially for the acidic polysaccharides with high viscosity, it seems that the flow rate is too low.",

In particular, anion exchange column chromatography is usually used at first for bulky polysaccharide solution. Polysaccharide solution can be concentrated and preliminarily purified through this method, even some polysaccharides can be purified homogeneous fractions. The widely used anion exchanger so far are DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-Sephadex and DEAE-Sepharose, among which DEAE-cellulose is usually the first choice [81]. DEAE-cellulose possesses an open framework and polysaccharide molecules can freely enter this carrier and diffuse rapidly. DEAE-cellulose has a big surface area. Although its ion-exchange capacity is only 0.70\u2fff0.75 mmol/g, the absorption quantity of DEAE-cellulose to polysaccharides is much larger than ion exchange resin. In addition, since ion exchange groups on cellulose are less, loose in arrangement and alkalescent, the adsorption of DEAE-cellulose to polysaccharides is weak and polysaccharides can be eluted out using salt solution of a certain ion concentration.",

The separation mechanism of anion exchange column chromatography is not only ion-exchange, but also adsorption-desorption. So anion exchange column chromatography can be used in the separation of neutral and acidic polysaccharides, and the separation of different neutral polysaccharides as well. In general, when the pH value is 6.0, acidic polysaccharide can be adsorbed to the exchanger whereas neutral polysaccharide can not be adsorbed [79], [80], [81], [82]. Then the buffers which have same pH value and different ionic strength can be used to elute these acidic polysaccharides out respectively. The ability of polysaccharide to adsorb exchanger is related to polysaccharide structure. The adsorb ability usually increases with the increase of acidic groups in polysaccharide molecules. For linear molecules, larger MW neutral polysaccharide is easier to be adsorbed compared to smaller MW polysaccharide. The adsorb ability of straight chain polysaccharide is greater than that of branched chain polysaccharide. In most cases, 100 g of DEAE-cellulose can load 0.5\u2fff1.5 g of dry polysaccharide sample. The elution mode is usually to use buffers with different ionic strength to carry out gradient elution or stepwise elution. In addition, neutral polysaccharide can also form coordination compound with borax (sodium tetraborate) [86]. Based on this, DEAE-cellulose is sometimes processed into borax-type DEAE-cellulose. When the polysaccharide solution flows through the borax-type DEAE-cellulose column, polysaccharide will coordinate with borax and adsorb on the column. Then the column is eluted using borate solution of different concentrations. The eluate which flows out first is the polysaccharide fraction that does not coordinate with borax, and the eluate flowing out last is the polysaccharide fraction that coordinates with borax most strongly.",

The process is described simply as below: an affinity column should be prepared in advance. The affinity column is eluted using the polysaccharide solution as mobile phase. The polysaccharide solution is a mixture of polysaccharide fractions. During the elution process, only the polysaccharide fraction that can bind with the ligand would be combined and adsorbed to the column, and other polysaccharide fractions that can not bind with the ligand would flow out of the column. Then the ionic strength and pH value of the mobile phase can be properly changed to dissociate the polysaccharide fraction combined with the ligand.

The rationale of this method is that when polysaccharides are centrifuged in the inert gradient media and reach an equilibrium, different MW polysaccharides can be gathered and distributed to certain specific positions within gradient and form different zones, then these zones are to be separated so different polysaccharide fractions can be obtained. The commonly used inert media are water, NaCl solution and CsCl solution etc. The centrifugal speed is generally set up to 60,000 rpm or so.

In theory, it is feasible to use this method to separate and purify polysaccharides. But in practical operation, there are some problems [31]. Most ultrafiltration membranes can adsorb polysaccharides, which leads to the biggish decrease of polysaccharide yield. For example, hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane can greatly adsorb polysaccharides. In addition, the ultrafiltration speed is much low and the time-consuming is too long because many polysaccharide solutions are very viscous. Even the polysaccharides can go bad during the long ultrafiltration processing period. Furthermore, the shape of most polysaccharide molecules is not spherical.
