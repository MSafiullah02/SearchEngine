Even with the advent of laboratory automation and the integration of genomics and proteomics in microbiology, interpretation of results still depends on the quality of the specimens received for analysis whether one is suspecting a prokaryote or a eukaryote as the etiologic agent, both of which are featured in this document. Microbes tend to be uniquely suited to adapt to environments where antibiotics and host responses apply pressures that encourage their survival. A laboratory instrument may or may not detect those mutations, which can present a challenge to clinical interpretation. Clearly, microbes grow, multiply, and die very quickly. If any of those events occur during the preanalytical specimen management processes, the results of analysis will be compromised and interpretation could be misleading.",

To provide that level of quality, however, the laboratory requires that all microbiology specimens be properly selected, collected, and transported to optimize analysis and interpretation. Because result interpretation in microbiology depends entirely on the quality of the specimen submitted for analysis, specimen management cannot be left to chance, and those that collect specimens for microbiologic analysis must be aware of what the physician needs for patient care as well as what the laboratory needs to provide accurate results, including ensuring that specimens arrive at the laboratory for analysis as quickly as possible after collection (Table 1).",

To meet those needs, the laboratory requires a specimen that has been appropriately selected, collected, and transported to the laboratory for analysis. Caught in the middle, between the physician and laboratory requirements, are the medical personnel who actually select and collect the specimen and who may not know or understand what the physician or the laboratory needs to do their work.

This document illustrates and promotes this partnership and emphasizes the importance of appropriate specimen management to clinical relevance of the results. One of the most valuable laboratory partners in infectious disease diagnosis is the certified microbiology specialist, particularly a specialist certified as a Diplomate by the American Board of Medical Microbiology, the American Board of Pathology, or the American Board of Medical Laboratory Immunology or their equivalent certified by other organizations.

Another unique feature is that in most chapters, there are targeted recommendations and precautions regarding selecting and collecting specimens for analysis for a disease process.

For the great majority of etiologic agents of BSIs, conventional blood culture methods provide positive results within 48 hours; incubation for >5 days seldom is required when modern automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems and media are used [1, 2]. This includes recovery of historically fastidious organisms such as HACEK [1] (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella) bacteria and Brucella species (spp) [3, 4]. Some microorganisms, such as mycobacteria and dimorphic fungi, require longer incubation periods; others may require special culture media or non-culture-based methods. Although filamentous fungi often require special broth media or lysis-centrifugation vials for detection, most Candida spp grow very well in standard blood culture broths unless the patient has been on antifungal therapy. Unfortunately, blood cultures from patients with suspected candidemia do not yield positive results in almost half of patients. Table 2 provides a summary of diagnostic methods for most BSIs.",

The most common etiologic agents of culture-negative endocarditis, Bartonella spp and Coxiella burnetii, often can be detected by conventional serologic testing. However, molecular amplification methods may be needed for detection of these organisms as well as others (eg, Tropheryma whipplei, Bartonella spp). In rare instances of culture-negative endocarditis, 16S polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing of valve tissue may help determine an etiologic agent.",

For adults, 20\u201330 mL of blood per culture set (depending on the manufacturer of the instrument) is recommended and may require >2 culture bottles depending on the system.

In addition, new products are now available that allow diversion and discard of the first few milliliters of blood that are most likely to contain skin contaminants. Consensus guidelines [2] and expert panels [1] recommend peripheral venipuncture as the preferred technique for obtaining blood for culture based on data showing that blood obtained in this fashion is less likely to be contaminated than blood obtained from an intravascular catheter or other device. Several studies have documented that iodine tincture, chlorine peroxide, and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) are superior to povidone-iodine preparations as skin disinfectants for blood culture [1, 2]. Iodine tincture and CHG require about 30 seconds to exert an antiseptic effect compared with 1.5\u20132 minutes for povidone-iodine preparations [2]. Two recent studies have documented equivalent contamination rates with iodine tincture and CHG [8, 9].

Reports of false-negative HSV NAAT are the basis of recommendations to collect another CSF specimen 3\u20137 days later for repeat testing if HSV encephalitis continues to be suspected [26, 29]. The sensitivity of NAAT performed on CSF for enterovirus encephalitis is >95% and the sensitivity of culture is 65%\u201375% (recovery from throat or stool is circumstantial etiologic evidence) [27]. Additional NAAT specific for parechoviruses is recommended for young children [29].

Specimen types include swabs of ulcers, corneal scrapings, impression membrane cultures, biopsies, or anterior chamber aspirates, or vitreous aspirates/washings [36, 37]. The volume of specimens is always limited. This specimen limitation makes it necessary for the laboratory to prioritize procedures depending on what organisms are sought; this should always be done after discussion with the ophthalmologist who collects the specimen and the infectious disease consultant when appropriate. This is particularly important because all major pathogen groups\u2014viruses, parasites, bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi\u2014can cause ocular infection. Both epidemiology and clinical presentation are used to narrow the organism(s) sought and the laboratory tests requested. Because of the limited specimen size seen with scrapings and biopsies, the laboratory and ophthalmologist may agree to inoculate these specimens onto media and prepare smears at the bedside. In this case, the laboratory should supply the necessary media and slides to the ophthalmologist. If these supplies are stored in the clinic or operating suite for ready access by the surgeon, it is the laboratory\u2019s responsibility to assure that these materials do not out-date and meet all quality control standards. Aspirates from the anterior chamber or vitreous are the optimal specimens for detection of anaerobic bacteria and viral agents; they can be submitted in syringes with needles removed. Syringes should be placed in a leak-proof outer container for transport. Injection of the fluid into a small sterile vial (provided by the laboratory) is preferable.

Because of the distinctive clinical presentation of both bacterial and viral conjunctivitis coupled with the self-limited nature of these infections, determining its etiology is infrequently attempted [42]. When tests are requested, diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis is often compromised by the prior use of empiric antibacterial therapy [40, 41]. Sexually active patients who present with bacterial conjunctivitis should have an aggressive diagnostic workup with Gram stain and cultures because of their risk for N. gonorrhoeae conjunctivitis [43]. This is a sight-threatening infection which can result in perforation of the globe. In the developing world, trachoma, a form of conjunctivitis due to specific strains of C. trachomatis is a leading cause of blindness, especially in children [44]. Off-label use of commercial NAAT assays is used for detection of this agent in research settings [44]. Certain organisms that are part of the indigenous skin and mucous membrane microflora, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, Corynebacterium spp, and viridans streptococci, are generally considered nonpathogenic when recovered from the conjunctival mucosa and are considered to be \u201cnormal flora.\u201d In specimens taken from the surface or interior of the eye, these organisms along with Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes are considered pathogens, especially in patient postcataract or LASIK surgery [36]. Adenovirus, the etiologic agent of \u201cpink eye,\u201d is highly transmissible in a variety of settings. This is almost always a clinical diagnosis, although for epidemiologic purposes culture or NAAT can be done [36]. Most cases of neonatal conjunctivitis are due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, or herpes simplex virus. Commercial NAATs for both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are not FDA approved for this specimen type so culture or in the case of C. trachomatis, DFA testing, if available, can be used [36, 44].

However, culture of such solutions and cases is not recommended because of the frequency with which they are falsely positive [50, 51]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common cause of sporadic contact lens\u2013associated keratitis, but outbreaks of keratitis due to contamination of contact lens care solutions have been recently reported with both Fusarium and Acanthamoeba [50\u201353]. Sporadic cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis are increasing, with >90% associated with improper contact lens use [54]. Postsurgical keratitis infections are frequently due to either coagulase-negative staphylococci or C. acnes, so in this setting these organisms should not be considered contaminants but as potential pathogens [36]. Keratitis postcorneal transplant is most commonly due to Candida spp (80% of cases). This is due in part to the most widely used corneal holding medium not containing any antifungal agents [55].",

The comparison of intraocular antibody levels in aqueous humor to that in serum has been found to be a useful means for diagnosing ocular toxoplasmosis, although not consistently accurate. Because the specimen needed for testing can only be obtained by an experienced ophthalmologist and is an invasive procedure, it is unlikely that this technique will be used outside the research setting [68]. NAAT of blood, vitreous, or aqueous fluids is not as sensitive as intraocular antibody determinations, but the specimens for testing may be more easily obtained. Sensitivities of NAATs ranging from 50% to 80% have been reported in patients with T. gondii retinitis depending upon the sequence used and the specimen tested.

Nevertheless, cases do occur in HIV patients who have either failed HIV therapy or as an AIDS-presenting diagnosis [73]. In addition, CMV retinitis has been a well-recognized complication of bone marrow and solid organ transplantation, less frequent recently due to improvements in preemptive detection and therapy. CMV retinitis is frequently diagnosed clinically because of characteristic lesions seen on ophthalmologic examination. Quantitative CMV NAAT performed on peripheral blood is also a useful tool in the diagnosis and management of this infection. Patients with detectable CMV viral loads have a higher likelihood of retinal disease progression, and those with high CMV viral loads have increased mortality. Patients with undetectable CMV viral loads have a low likelihood of having virus that is resistant to antiviral agents [74]. Because of interlaboratory variation in viral quantification, what represents a positive CMV viral load and a high CMV viral load will vary among laboratories [75]. Physicians should consult the laboratory performing the CMV viral load for assistance with test interpretation.",

Acute OM with effusion is the clinical variant of OM most likely to have a bacterial etiology and, as a result, most likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy [87, 88] (Table 16). Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial causes of OM, with S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurring less commonly [89]. Turicella otitidis and Staphylococcus auricularis are emerging pathogens thought to cause OM, but additional studies are needed to determine the true significance of these organisms [89, 90]. Chronic suppurative OM is associated with a higher rate of complications than acute OM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus are the most common pathogens in chronic OM [91]. A variety of respiratory viruses are known to cause OM; however, there exists no pathogen specific therapy and as a result, there is little reason to attempt to establish an etiologic diagnosis in patients with a viral etiology. Efforts to determine the cause of OM are best reserved for patients likely to have a bacterial etiology (recent onset, bulging tympanic membrane, pain, or exudate) who have not responded to prior courses of antimicrobial therapy, patients with immunological deficiencies, and acutely ill patients [86, 88]. The only representative specimen is middle ear fluid obtained either by tympanocentesis or, in patients with otorrhea or myringotomy tubes, by collecting drainage on mini-tipped swabs directly after cleaning the ear canal. Cultures of the pharynx, nasopharynx, anterior nares, or nasal drainage material are of no value in attempting to establish an etiologic diagnosis of bacterial OM (Table 16) [92].",

The direct costs of managing acute and chronic rhinosinusitis exceed US$11 billion per year. The etiological agents of rhinosinusitis vary based upon the duration of symptoms and whether it is community acquired or of nosocomial origin (Table 17). Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable H. influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial causes of acute maxillary sinusitis. The role of respiratory viruses in sinusitis needs further study, but most patients with acute sinusitis have an upper respiratory virus detectable early in the illness [93]. Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacilli, Streptococcus spp, and anaerobic bacteria are associated more frequently with subacute, chronic, or healthcare-associated sinusitis [94]. The role of fungi as etiological agents is more controversial, possibly due to numerous publications that used poor sample collection methods and thus did not recover the fungal agents. In immunocompetent hosts, fungi are associated most often with chronic sinusitis, though the significance of fungal presence in chronic sinusitis is frequently uncertain [93, 95, 96]. Invasive sinusitis due to fungal infections in severely immunocompromised persons or uncontrolled diabetic patients is often severe and carries a high mortality rate.",

Endoscopically obtained swabs can recover bacterial pathogens but rarely detect the causative fungi [92, 97, 98]. In maxillary sinusitis, antral puncture with sinus aspiration (though seldom done) and, in adults, swabs of material draining from the middle meatus obtained under endoscopic guidance represent the only adequate specimens. Cultures of middle meatus drainage specimens are not recommended for pediatric patients due to colonization with normal microbiota, which overlaps with potential respiratory tract pathogens. Examination of nasal drainage material is of no value in attempting to determine the cause of maxillary sinusitis. Surgical procedures are necessary to obtain specimens representative of infection of the frontal, sphenoid, or ethmoid sinuses.

Recovery of the same organism from multiple patients during an outbreak should be investigated. Arcanobacterium haemolyticum also causes pharyngitis but less commonly. It occurs most often in teenagers and young adults and causes a highly suggestive scarlatina-form rash in some patients.

Those patients who require admission should have pretreatment blood cultures, culture and Gram stain of good-quality samples of expectorated sputum and, if disease is severe, urinary antigen tests for S. pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila where available. The recommendations for children are in agreement with the adult recommendations with respect to when to obtain blood cultures and sputum cultures but differ slightly for other laboratory tests [114]. Testing for viral pathogens is recommended in both outpatient and inpatient settings [114]. Although a weak recommendation, in children with appropriate signs and symptoms, Mycoplasma pneumoniae testing is indicated. There are several molecular assays available for M. pneumoniae detection [114] and at least one assay that also detects Chlamydia pneumoniae.

In the nonventilated patient, the specimens could include those obtained by spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, or nasotracheal suction in an uncooperative patient and, in the ventilated patient, endonasotracheal aspirates are preferred [116]. Determining the cause of the pneumonia relies upon initial Gram stain and semi-quantitative cultures of endotracheal aspirates or sputum. A smear lacking inflammatory cells and a culture absent of potential pathogens have a very high negative predictive value. Cultures of endotracheal aspirates, while likely to contain the true pathogen, also consistently grow more mixtures of species of bacteria than specimens obtained by bronchoscopic techniques. This may lead to additional unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Quantitative assessment of invasively obtained samples such as BAL fluid and protected specimen brush specimens is often performed [116]. Quantities of bacterial growth above a threshold are diagnostic of pneumonia and quantities below that threshold are more consistent with colonization. The generally accepted thresholds are as follows: endotracheal aspirates, 106 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL; BAL fluid, 104 CFU/mL; protected specimen brush samples, 103 CFU/mL [116]. Quantitative studies require extensive laboratory work and special procedures that smaller laboratories may not accommodate and are therefore not endorsed by the guidance despite studies that show decreased antibiotic utilization with quantitative cultures [116].

The infectious causes of pleural effusions differ between community-acquired and hospital-acquired disease. In a large multicenter study (MIST1) of 454 adult patients with pleural infection to assess streptokinase treatment, the major pathogens recovered in decreasing order of frequency were S. anginosus group, S. aureus, anaerobic bacteria, other streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and S. pneumoniae [118]. Among patients with hospital-acquired infection, S. aureus tops the list, with at least half of them being methicillin resistant, followed by Enterobacteriaceae, the streptococci (anginosus group, S. pneumoniae), Enterococcus spp, and anaerobes [118, 119]. Table 22 summarizes the major pathogens. Any significant accumulation of fluid in the pleural space should be sampled by thoracentesis. Specimens should be hand carried immediately to the laboratory or placed into appropriate anaerobic transport media for transport. In some institutions, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles has become an established practice. This is acceptable and has been shown to increase the sensitivity by 20% [119]. The manufacturer\u2019s guidelines should be followed with respect to the volume inoculated and whether supplementation is required to enhance recovery of fastidious pathogens such as S. pneumoniae. If blood culture bottles are used, an additional sample should be sent to the microbiology laboratory for Gram stain and culture of nonbacterial pathogens when indicated. Even when optimum handling occurs, cultures may fail to yield an organism. Laboratory-developed NAATs targeting pneumococcal genes, such as those that encode pneumolysin and autolysin, in fluid from pediatric cases of pleural infection, have been very useful [117].",

These values assist with the determination of a transudative or exudative process and in the subsequent management of the syndrome. A recent meta-analysis showed that the best predictors of an exudate were pleural fluid cholesterol level >55 mg/dL and an LDH >200 U/L or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol >0.3 [120]. Most infections result in an exudate or polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) (empyema) within the pleural cavity. When tuberculosis or a fungal pathogen is thought to be the likely cause, a pleural biopsy sent for culture and histopathology increases the diagnostic sensitivity. Always notify the laboratory of a suspicion of tuberculosis so that appropriate safety precautions can be employed. The recently published IDSA/ATS/CDC guidelines on the diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children \u201cweakly recommends\u201d the measurement of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and free interferon-\u03bb (IFN-\u03bb) in pleural fluid. This endorsement is based upon a sensitivity and specificity of ADA of \u226579% and \u226583%, respectively, as determined by several meta-analyses [121]. The figures for free IFN-\u03bb were \u226589% and \u226597% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively [121]. It should be stressed that the quality of evidence is low and both markers should be used in conjunction with hematologic and chemical parameters and other diagnostic tests such as NAAT, culture, and histology of a pleural biopsy. The performance of ADA in developed countries has been shown to be quite variable and is related to multiple factors including the type of method used, the likelihood of tuberculosis, and \u201cfalse positive\u201d results in patients with other causes of lymphocytic pleural effusion such as rheumatoid disease, mesothelioma, and histoplasmosis [122].",

The spectrum of organisms associated with disease continues to expand and studies of the microbiome demonstrate the complex synergy between easily cultivatable and noncultivatable organisms. Table 23 lists the most frequently isolated pathogens in this patient population. Early in childhood, infections are caused by organisms frequently seen in the non-CF pediatric population such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus. Of these organisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has significantly increased in prevalence [123]. At some point, later in childhood or adolescence, P. aeruginosa becomes the most important pathogen involved in chronic lung infection and the concomitant lung destruction that follows. The P. aeruginosa strains adapt to the hypoxic stress of the retained mucoid secretions by converting to a biofilm mode of growth (mucoid colonies). Nosocomial pathogens such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, and Achromobacter ruhlandii may be acquired during a hospital or clinic visit. Burkholderia cepacia complex is a very important pathogen in these patients. Burkholderia cenocepacia is highly pathogenic and is responsible for rapid decline and death in a subset of patients who acquire the virulent clones. Special microbiological techniques are required to recover and differentiate B. cepacia complex from the mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. Less common gram-negative organisms that appear to be increasing in their frequency of recovery, but whose role in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease is still unclear, include Burkholderia gladioli, Ralstonia spp, Cupriavidus spp, Inquilinus spp, and Pandoraea [124, 125]. The reader is referred to the Parkins and Floto reference for a discussion of pathogens within the CF microbiota [123].",

It is suggested that microbiology laboratories, in collaboration with infectious diseases physicians and pulmonologists, develop an algorithm for processing samples that includes testing for all major categories of pathogens as summarized in the table. Cytologic analysis and/or histopathology are often needed to interpret the significance of positive NAAT or culture for herpesviruses, for example, and to definitively diagnose filamentous fungi. It should be noted, however, that histopathology alone is not sensitive enough to diagnose fungal infections and should be accompanied by immunostain, culture, and, when available, NAATs [128, 129]. In addition, serum and BAL galactomannan and serum 1\u20133 \u03b2-d-glucan tests may be helpful. However, cytology and/or histopathology are quite useful for distinguishing conditions such as pulmonary hemorrhage and rejection from infectious causes of infiltrates.

Diagnosis of H. pylori infection is critical as treatment can decrease morbidity. Testing is recommended for all patients with peptic ulcer disease, gastric mucosa\u2013associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and early gastric cancer. In some patients with dyspepsia, noninvasive testing is an option [136]. Both invasive and noninvasive tests (Table 26) are available to aid in the diagnosis [137]. Invasive tests such as Gram stain and culture of endoscopy tissue, histopathologic staining, and direct tests for urease require the collection of biopsy samples obtained during endoscopy from patients who have not received antimicrobial agents or proton pump inhibitors in the 2 weeks prior to collection and, as such, pose greater risks to the patient. Culture, although not routinely performed, allows for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The advantage to the noninvasive assays such as the urea breath test and stool antigen determinations is that patients can avoid endoscopy and gastric biopsy. They are also useful to test for organism eradication after therapy. Collection of specimens for the urea breath test may be performed in the clinic. This assay has a sensitivity of approximately 95%, comparable to the invasive assays. Stool antigen tests have a reported sensitivity of 88%\u201398%, with sensitivity being higher in adults than in children. The noninvasive assays are also useful to test for organism eradication after therapy, the urea breath test having a somewhat higher sensitivity than stool antigen detection. Serodiagnosis has a lower sensitivity (<90%) and specificity (90%) and is not useful for test of cure after therapy.",

Toxigenic culture is probably the most sensitive and specific of the assays for the detection of C. difficile, although detection of a toxigenic organism is not, in itself, specific for infection. It is slow and labor intensive and not routinely performed in the community hospital setting. Compared to toxigenic culture, the cytotoxin assay has a sensitivity of 85%\u201390%. The cytotoxin assay requires 24\u201348 hours and is also labor intensive. Thus, toxin detection by either enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or immunochromatographic methods are widely used in clinical practice. These assays have reported sensitivity of 70%\u201385% but are significantly faster with results available in <2 hours. Utilization of an assay that detects both toxin A and toxin B improves the sensitivity. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) antigen assays are sensitive but have poor specificity. NAATs for the detection of C. difficile have reported sensitivity of 93%\u2013100%. To reduce turnaround time, reduce costs, and improve accuracy of C. difficile\u2013associated disease, some laboratories employ an algorithm that utilizes GDH as a rapid screening test, followed by (or simultaneous to, as part of the same test platform), EIA for toxin A and B detection with or without cytotoxin testing or NAAT to arbitrate discrepant GDH and EIA toxin results. These algorithms allow for both the rapid reporting of most negative specimens and the sensitivity of cytotoxin testing or NAAT, but could result in delays depending on the laboratory testing algorithm employed [146\u2013148]. NAAT detects viable and nonviable organisms. To decrease the identification of colonized patients, some laboratories are performing both NAAT tests and tests to detect toxin production. Diarrheal stool specimens (not formed stools or rectal swabs) are required for the diagnosis of C. difficile disease (not colonization). The specimen should be loose enough to take the shape of the container. Formed stools should be appropriately rejected by the laboratory but with the proviso that formed stools from patients with ileus, or potential toxic megacolon, as noted by the physician, should be tested. When testing is limited to patients not receiving laxatives and with unexplained and new-onset diarrhea (\u22653 unformed stools in 24 hours), NAAT alone, or toxin EIA as part of a multistep algorithm (GDH plus toxin, GDH plus toxin arbitrated by NAAT, or NAAT plus toxin) are the recommended test options. When there are no institutionally agreed upon limiting criteria for stool submission, toxin EIA, as part of a multistep algorithm as defined above, is recommended, not NAAT testing alone. Repeat testing of patients previously positive as a \u201ctest of cure\u201d is not appropriate. Repeat testing of patients negative by NAATs should not be performed for at least 6 days [148, 149].",

SBP is an ascitic fluid infection without an evident intra-abdominal focus, tends to be monomicrobic, and is usually caused by aerobic organisms from the intestinal tract; therefore, anaerobic cultures are less valuable. Sufficient fluid (eg, 10\u201350 mL if available) should be obtained to allow for concentration by centrifugation and a cytospin Gram stain evaluation. At a minimum, at least 10 mL of peritoneal fluid (not swabs of the fluid) should be collected aseptically and transported to the laboratory prior to the administration of antimicrobial agents. Additional laboratory testing should include fluid analysis for protein, cell count and differential, lactate concentration, and pH along with 2\u20133 sets of blood cultures for the identification of concomitant bacteremia (Table 29). Alternatively, because SBP and infections of ascites fluid tend to be monomicrobic, an aerobic blood culture bottle can be inoculated with fluid (volume dependent upon blood culture system) if the presence of a single organism is reasonably certain. A Gram stain may be used prior to broth inoculation to evaluate the morphology of any organism(s) present in the specimen. Since the differentiation between SBP and secondary peritonitis may be uncertain, it may be beneficial to submit peritoneal fluid in a sterile container for conventional culture and stain as well as to inoculate blood culture bottles at the bedside with the fluid. Mass spectrometry, sequencing, and 16S PCR can be used to identify isolates present in these specimens if these techniques are available to the laboratory. In the next few years, next-generation sequencing will be able to analyze such specimens to determine the total microbial load by species. If >1 morphologic type is noted in the Gram stain, a broth should not be inoculated. The caveat for use of blood culture bottles with fluid other than blood is that not all systems have been evaluated for this purpose. Furthermore, broth cultures do not accurately reflect the bacterial burden or the variety of organisms at the time the specimen is obtained, and the presence of a true pathogen may be obscured by the overgrowth of a more rapidly growing organism.",

There are numerous causes of secondary peritonitis including iatrogenic or accidental trauma, perforated appendix or diverticuli, typhlitis, or intra-abdominal abscess. Complications from bariatric surgery may also cause secondary peritonitis. Unlike SBP, however, secondary peritonitis tends to be polymicrobic and may include anaerobic flora. Organisms such as S. aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, and Mycobacterium spp are unusual in this setting. Common etiologies include aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative rods (Bacteroides spp, E. coli, Klebsiella spp) and gram-positive flora (Clostridium spp, Enterococcus spp, Bifidobacterium spp, Peptostreptococcus spp). Infectious complications following bariatric surgery are frequently due to gram-positive cocci and yeast (Candida spp). Since many obese patients have had prior exposure to antibiotics, multidrug-resistant organisms are of concern [160, 161]. If typhlitis is suspected, C. difficile toxin testing, stool cultures for enteric pathogens, and blood cultures should be requested. Additionally, Clostridium septicum should be considered in neutropenic enterocolitis.",

Gram-positive bacteria (predominantly Staphylococcus spp and, to a lesser extent, Streptococcus and Corynebacterium spp) account for >60% of cultured microorganisms. Gram-negative bacteria (mostly E. coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter spp) represent <30% of positive cultures while anaerobes comprise <3% of isolates [158, 163, 164]. Fungi, especially Candida spp, contribute to the same number of identified infections as anaerobes [165]. Cultures can remain negative in >20% of all cases of PDAP [163]. Again, 10\u201350 mL of dialysate should be collected for concentration and culture, cytospin Gram stain evaluation, analysis for protein, and cell count and differential (Table 30). Blood cultures are rarely positive in cases of PDAP [158]. Direct inoculation of dialysate or a concentrated dialysate into an aerobic blood culture bottle for automated detection has proven to be as effective as direct plating of centrifuged fluid [164, 165]. Consult directly with the microbiology laboratory when primary cultures of fluid are negative and additional cultures for slowly growing or highly fastidious organisms such as Mycobacterium, Nocardia, and filamentous fungi should be pursued. If Nocardia is of concern, primary culture plates require prolonged incubation or culture on fungal media or buffered charcoal yeast extract agar.",

The location, size, and number of liver abscesses is often not helpful for differentiation purposes as the majority are in the right lobe and can be seen in single or multiple loci [166\u2013168]. In regions where E. histolytica disease is endemic, the use of serology or serum antigen detection tests can be helpful to exclude amebic abscess [169], whereas examination of stool for cysts and trophozoites is generally not (Table 30). Liver abscess aspirates can be tested for the presence of E. histolytica antigen as well as submitted for direct microscopic evaluation for parasites. When amebic disease is unlikely, the abscess should be aspirated and the contents submitted in anaerobic transport for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures. Commonly recovered isolates include Klebsiella spp, E. coli, and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp, Streptococcus spp including Streptococcus anginosus group spp, Enterococcus spp, viridans group streptococci, S. aureus, Bacteroides spp, Fusobacterium spp (especially with Lemierre syndrome), Clostridium spp, and, rarely, Candida spp [166\u2013168]. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture should be requested (Table 30). Blood cultures can also be helpful in establishing an etiology if collected prior to the institution of antimicrobial therapy [167, 168]. Occasionally, patients with primary genital infections due to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis can have extension of the disease to involve the liver capsule or adjacent peritoneum (Fitz-Hugh\u2013Curtis syndrome).",

Anaerobic bacteria have been recovered in 5%\u201317% of culture-positive cases [170]. Aspirates should be processed in a similar manner as pyogenic liver abscesses including aerobic and anaerobic culture, Gram stain, and concomitantly collected blood culture sets (Table 30). Unusual causes of splenic abscess include Bartonella spp, Brucella melitensis, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Nocardia spp, and Burkholderia pseudomallei (uncommon outside of Southeast Asia or without suggestive travel history) [171]. The laboratory should be notified if B. melitensis or B. pseudomallei is possible due to the need for increased biosafety/security precautions since they are potential bioterrorism agents. As in biliary disease, the spectrum of organisms to be considered needs to be expanded to include Mycobacterium spp, fungi (including Pneumocystis jirovecii), and parasites for immunocompromised patients [171].",

Vertebral osteomyelitis/spondylodiscitis will be separately considered. Osteomyelitis is typically suspected on clinical grounds, with confirmation involving imaging and microbiologic and histopathologic tests. The peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated. Establishing an etiologic diagnosis, which is important for directing appropriate clinical management since this varies by microorganism type and associated antimicrobial susceptibility, nearly always requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation. This can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sampling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic material (Table 31). Swabs are not recommended. Cultures of sinus tracts are generally not recommended because recovered organisms usually do not correlate with those found in deep cultures, although S. aureus shows modest correlation. Hematogenous osteomyelitis is usually monobacterial, whereas that resulting from contiguous infection is often polymicrobial. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis of long bones mainly occurs in prepubertal children, but can occur in the elderly, injection drug users, and those with indwelling central venous catheters. In prepubertal children, the most common microorganisms involved are S. aureus and S. pneumoniae; Kingella kingae is common in children <4 years of age [174]. Osteomyelitis in neonates, especially in those with indwelling central venous catheters, typically results from hematogenous spread; commonly involved organisms include Streptococcus agalactiae and aerobic gram-negative bacteria, especially E. coli. Candida spp and P. aeruginosa are more commonly encountered in injection drug users and those with indwelling central venous catheters. In children, the diagnosis is often made based on clinical and imaging findings in the context of positive blood cultures. NAATs are particularly useful for diagnosing K. kingae bone and joint infection in children <4 years of age. In adults, imaging-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary.",

Readers are referred to a guideline that provides detail on the diagnosis of PJI [178]. Preoperatively, ESR and CRP are recommended, as is arthrocentesis for synovial fluid cell count, differential, and culture, ideally in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles. Criteria for the interpretation of synovial fluid cell count and differential in the presence of a prosthetic joint differ from those in native joints. Intraoperative frozen section analysis is a reliable diagnostic test. For tissue culture, multiple specimens should be submitted for aerobic and anaerobic cultures, 4 if using conventional plate and broth cultures, and 3 if culturing tissues in aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles [179]. Tissue can be processed in a number of ways, including crushing, stomaching, and bead mill processing using glass beads [180]. Two or more intraoperative cultures or a combination of preoperative aspiration and intraoperative cultures that yield the same organism is considered definitive evidence of PJI. Notably, single positive tissue or synovial fluid cultures, especially for organisms that may be contaminants (eg, coagulase-negative staphylococci, C. acnes), should not be considered evidence of definite PJI. Gram stains are not recommended. Isolation of C. acnes may require culture incubation times as long as 14 days. The pathogenesis of PJI relates to the presence of microorganisms in biofilms on the implant surface. Therefore, if the arthroplasty is resected, the implant components may be vortexed and sonicated and the resultant sonication fluid semi-quantitatively cultured [181]. Since fungi and mycobacteria are extremely rare in this setting, they should not be routinely sought.",

These provide diagnostic recommendations that are similar to those presented here (Table 34). The differentiation of cystitis and pyelonephritis requires clinical information and physical findings as well as laboratory information, and from the laboratory perspective the spectrum of pathogens is similar for the 2 syndromes [185]. Culturing only urines that have tested positive for pyuria, either with a dipstick test for leukocyte esterase or other indicators of PMNs, may increase the likelihood of a positive culture, but occasionally samples yielding positive screening tests yield negative culture results and vice versa [186]. The Gram stain is not the appropriate method to detect PMNs in urine, but it can be ordered as an option for detection of high numbers of gram-negative rods when a patient is suspected of suffering from urosepsis. Because urine is so easily contaminated with commensal flora, specimens for culture of bacterial urinary tract pathogens should be collected with attention to minimizing contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota [187]. Although some literature suggests that traditional skin cleansing in preparation for the collection of midstream or \u201cclean catch\u201d specimens is not of benefit, many laboratories find that such specimens obtained without skin cleansing routinely contain mixed flora and, if not stored properly and transported within 1 hour to the laboratory, yield high numbers of one or more potential pathogens on culture. Determining the true etiologic agent in such cultures is difficult, so skin cleansing is still recommended. The use of urine transport media in vacuum-fill tubes or refrigeration immediately after collection may decrease the proliferation of small numbers of contaminating organisms and increase the numbers of interpretable results. Straight or \u201cin-and-out\u201d catheterization of a properly prepared patient usually provides a less contaminated specimen. If mixed enteric bacteria in high numbers are recovered from a second, well-collected, straight-catheterized sample from the same patient, a enteric-urinary fistula should be considered. Laboratory actions should be based on decisions arrived at by dialogue between clinician and laboratory.",

Culture from indwelling catheters is therefore strongly discouraged, but if required, the specimen must be taken from the sampling port of a newly inserted device. Cultures of Foley catheter tips are of no clinical value and will be rejected. Collection of specimens from urinary diversions such as ileal loops is also discouraged because of the propensity of these locations to be chronically colonized. Chronic nephrostomy collections and bagged urine collections are also of questionable value. Multiple organisms or coagulase-negative staphylococci may be recovered in patients with urinary stents, and may be pathogenic. It is important that urologists and nephrologists who care for patients with complicated infections discuss any special needs or requests with the microbiology director or supervisor. Specimens from these patients may contain a mixed flora and if specific interpretive criteria are documented for these specimen types, the laboratory must be aware of the documentation and the special interpretive standards. Laboratories routinely provide antimicrobial susceptibility tests on potential pathogens in significant numbers. Specimens obtained by more invasive means, such as cystoscope or suprapubic aspirations, should be clearly identified and the workup discussed in advance with the laboratory, especially if the clinician is interested in recovery of bacteria in concentrations <1000 CFU per milliliter. Identification of a single potential pathogen in numbers as low as 200 CFU/mL may be significant, such as in acute urethral syndrome, but requests for culture results reports of <10000 CFU/mL should be coordinated with the laboratory so that an appropriate volume of urine can be processed.",

Traditionally testing has consisted of initial screening with an inexpensive nontreponemal test (ie, RPR), then retesting reactive specimens with a more specific, and more expensive, treponemal test (ie, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination). If a nontreponemal test is being used as the screening test, it should be confirmed, as a high percentage of false-positive results occur in many medical conditions unrelated to syphilis. When both test results are reactive, they indicate present or past infection. Many high-volume clinical laboratories have reversed the testing sequence and begin the testing algorithm first with a specific treponemal test, such as an EIA or chemiluminescence immunoassay, and then retesting reactive results with a nontreponemal test, such as RPR, to confirm diagnosis. Screening with a treponemal test can identify persons previously positive, treated, and/or partially treated for syphilis as well as yield false positives in patients with low likelihood of infection. If the follow-up confirmation test (RPR) is negative, it requires the laboratory to perform a different treponemal-specific test to guide management decisions (ie, fluorescent treponemal antibody\u2013absorbed) [194, 204]. Treponema pallidum cannot be seen on Gram stain and cannot be cultured in the routine laboratory. Darkfield exam for motile spirochetes is unavailable in the majority of laboratories.",

            "text": "The diagnoses of bacterial vaginosis (BV), or altered vaginal flora, and vaginitis caused by fungal organisms (vulvovaginal candidiasis [VVC]) or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), are often considered clinically and diagnostically as a group because of their overlapping signs and symptoms. However, the mode of transmission and/or acquisition is not necessarily that of an STI for VVC, but may be for BV and is for TV. A number of point-of-care tests can be performed from a vaginal discharge specimen while the patient is in the healthcare setting. Although point-of-care tests are popular, the sensitivity and specificity for making a specific diagnosis vary widely and these assays, while rapid, are often diagnostically poor. Some of the tests include a pH strip test, scored Gram stain for BV, wet mount for TV, and 10% KOH microscopic examinations for VVC. For BV, use of clinical criteria (Amsel diagnostic criteria) is equal to a scored Gram stain of vaginal discharge. However, a scored Gram stain is more specific than probe hybridization, point-of-care tests, and culture that only detect the presence of G. vaginalis as the hallmark organism for altered vaginal flora) Table 38. For VVC and TV, the presence of pseudohyphae and motile trichomonads, respectively, allows a diagnosis. However, proficiency in microscopic examination is essential given that infections may be mixed and/or present with atypical manifestations. Unfortunately, consistent microscopic examination of vaginal specimens and interpretation are difficult for many laboratories to perform and wide variation of sensitivities (40%\u201370%) for both TV and VVC using smear examination exists relative to NAAT and culture, respectively [206]. It should be noted that recent publications utilizing NAATs highlight the prevalence of Trichomonas as equal to or greater than CT and GC in certain patient populations and point to a growing trend toward screening for TV, CT, and GC simultaneously [207, 208]. More recently, microbiome-based multiplex NAATs have become available for the diagnosis of BV and have been validated in several reference laboratories. One commercial product is now FDA-cleared. Preliminary data show greater specificity of this approach compared to methods that identify only G. vaginalis, as well as consistency in both reproducible as well as standardized results. Tests for the entities of vaginosis/vaginitis are shown in Table 38 [209\u2013214].",

Screening for group B streptococci (GBS) should occur at 35\u201337 weeks with both rectal and vaginal swab specimens submitted to optimize identification of carriers. Laboratories typically use an enrichment broth and selective media to enhance recovery for GBS. While NAATs are available for GBS, the sensitivity is optimal only when performed from an enrichment broth specimen. Women with bacteriuria with GBS (as single pathogen or predominant pathogen isolated) indicate high carriage and increased risk for transmission of GBS to the neonate. Treating GBS prior to 35\u201337 weeks does not eliminate the need to treat at the time of delivery, and patients are assumed to be carriers. Susceptibility testing of GBS is not routinely performed and recommended only if the patient is allergic to penicillin. Group A streptococci are not detected by GBS PCR tests. Past history of STIs, those in higher-risk groups, and/or clinical presentation consistent with infection, should be assessed for other pathogens as warranted (ie, HSV if vesicular lesions are present). Although rare, Listeria infection in the pregnant woman (usually acquired via ingestion of unpasteurized cheese or other food) can be passed to the fetus, leading to disease or death of the neonate. Due to nonspecific symptoms, diagnosis is difficult, but blood cultures from a bacteremic mother may allow detection of this pathogen in time for antibiotic prophylaxis Screening tests (serology, stool cultures) in pregnant women are not appropriate [222].",

Sampling of the burn wound by either surface swab or tissue biopsy for culture is recommended for monitoring the presence and extent of infection (Table 41). Quantitative culture of either specimen is recommended; optimal utilization of quantitative surface swabs requires twice-weekly sampling of the same site to accurately monitor the trend of bacterial colonization. A major limitation of surface swab quantitative culture is that microbial growth reflects the microbial flora on the surface of the wound rather than the advancing margin of the subcutaneous or deep, underlying damaged tissue. Quantitative bacterial culture of tissue biopsy should be supplemented with histopathological examination to better ascertain the extent of microbial invasion. Be advised that quantitative bacterial cultures may not be offered in all laboratories; quantitative biopsy cultures should be considered for patients in whom grafting is necessary. For laboratories that provide quantitative wound culture services to wound care centers, which predominately manage chronic wounds, obtaining clinically relevant results is dependent upon obtaining tissue from deep within the wound to avoid surface and subsurface microbial flora, which essentially colonize these areas and are part of a biofilm. Collection of specimens using swabs is discouraged due to the significant limitations of swabs: (1) high risk of contamination with surface and subsurface contamination, and (2) limited specimen capacity (500 \u03bcL) leading to insufficient quantity of specimen, especially when cultures (fungal, mycobacterial) other than bacteriology are requested. Prior to any sampling or biopsy, the wound should be thoroughly cleansed and devoid of topical antimicrobials and debris that can affect culture results. Blood cultures should be collected for detection of systemic disease secondary to the wound.",

Most commonly, early localized Lyme disease (LD) is diagnosed on clinical grounds, including the presence of erythema migrans. Erythema migrans (EM; an expanding rash) was previously considered pathognomonic for Lyme borreliosis; however, other infections can mimic this dermatologic presentation (eg, southern tick-associated rash illness, cellulitis). Diagnostic testing for LD in patients who present with a characteristic EM rash, alongside an appropriate exposure history, is contraindicated, as antibodies to B. burgdorferi may not yet be detectable, leading to false-negative results and undertreatment. While NAAT for LD-associated Borrelia spp is available through multiple reference laboratories, performance of this testing on whole blood or other blood fractions for detection of early disseminated or late stages of LD is not recommended due to low sensitivity in this specimen source.",

For atypical EM, serology may be obtained and, if negative, one may obtain a convalescent serum or continue observation to see if the EM becomes more characteristic. Otherwise, NAATs may be performed on EM biopsy specimens to confirm early localized LD if the visual appearance of the EM rash is questionable. Serologic testing using a 2-tiered testing algorithm (TTTA) remains the testing methodology of choice for both early disseminated and late stages of LD. The TTTA currently recommended by the CDC involves an initial EIA or indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) screen for antibodies to LD-associated Borrelia spp, followed by supplemental Western blot or immunoblot testing for specific IgM- and IgG-class antibodies to B. burgdorferi in any sample positive or equivocal by an EIA/IFA screen. Immunoblot testing for antibodies to B. burgdorferi should not be performed as a standalone test as specificity is reduced.",

Endemic typhus and flea-borne typhus (Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia felis, respectively) may also infect people in the United States, mainly in warmer sites where fleas are common throughout the year. Rare epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii) cases have been recorded in the United States from contact with flying squirrels or their nests. Rickettsialpox (Rickettsia akari), comprising a mild febrile disease with rash and eschar, is maintained by mouse mites in many large urban areas. The diagnosis of patients with these infections is challenging early in the course of their clinical infection since signs and symptoms are often nonspecific or mimic benign viral illnesses. Rash is usually present in most acute rickettsiosis, but skin color may prevent its recognition. The likelihood of severe morbidity or mortality with delaying treatment for RMSF means that patients should be presumptively treated without waiting for laboratory confirmation, which rests mainly on seroconversion.",

Annually, tick-transmitted viral infections are on the order of 25 or fewer cases a year nationally; however, this is likely an underrepresentation due to the lack of available clinical assays for routine detection of these emerging vector-borne infections. Most cases due to these less common infections present with fever >38.9\u00b0C (>102\u00b0F) but other than the arboviral infections with neurologic signs, the presentation is nonspecific.

Depending on the sensitivity of the serologic assays used, HIV-specific antibodies are detectable in serum or plasma at the earliest at 21 days after exposure. Performing an HIV RNA test after a negative initial antibody and/or antigen test in persons suspected of acute infection may therefore be helpful. Due to the time course of test positivity and the possibility of seronegativity, laboratory diagnosis of primary (acute) HIV-1 infection is usually based on a high quantitative HIV-1 RNA (viral load) result (typically >105 copies/mL) or qualitative detection of HIV-1 RNA and/or proviral DNA (Table 48) [266]. However, in the setting of nonacute HIV infection, HIV viral load assays should be used with caution for diagnosis of HIV infection because of the possibility of false-positive results. Since false-positive results are generally of low copy number (<1000 copies/mL), low copy number results should prompt retesting of a second specimen. Notably, because there is a 10- to 12-day period after infection when serologic markers are not detectable, testing another specimen 2\u20134 weeks later should be considered if initial antibody, antigen, or RNA tests are negative. NAAT is not 100% sensitive in individuals with established HIV infection due to viral suppression, either naturally or therapeutically, or improper specimen collection/handling.

The US Association of Public Health Laboratories and the CDC now recommend the use of fourth-generation assays for initial screening of individuals for diagnosis of HIV infection [264, 265]. The testing algorithm using such assays recommends that serum or plasma specimens with reactive screening test results be tested in reflex with HIV antibody differentiation immunoassays that can distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. If the antibody differentiation assay result is negative, further testing with a qualitative or quantitative NAAT is recommended to rule out acute HIV-1 infection. If the differentiation assay is positive, viral load testing (and usually also CD4 cell count determination) is recommended to direct management. Alternatively, if a fifth-generation HIV antigen/antibody combination assay is used as the initial test and if only the HIV p24 antigen is reactive, then such specimens can be tested subsequently by NAAT, whereas those specimens that are reactive for HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies can be tested subsequently with HIV antibody differentiation assays. Use of third-generation screening assays is limited to the diagnosis of nonacute HIV-1 infection (Table 48), since these assays can detect only HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. Serum or plasma specimens that are reactive with such screening assays can be tested further with HIV antibody differentiation assays for confirmation.

Although serologic testing is not the preferred means of establishing a diagnosis of HHV-6 infection, IgG seroconversion, the demonstration of anti\u2013HHV-6 IgM, or a 4-fold rise in IgG antibody titers using paired sera may indicate recent infection. Commercial assays do not typically distinguish between variants A and B. Because of the ubiquitous nature of HHV-6, most people have been exposed to the virus by 2 years of age. Therefore, a single positive result for anti-HHV-6 IgG may not be able to differentiate recent infection from remote exposure. The most commonly used molecular test for the laboratory diagnosis of HHV-6 is NAAT and at least one multiplex test platform for this is FDA-cleared; some of these tests differentiate variants A and B (Table 53). However, qualitative NAAT does not differentiate replicating from latent virus. HHV-6 DNA quantification may be useful in this regard, as well as in monitoring response to antiviral therapy. HHV-6 may be shed intermittently by healthy and immunocompromised hosts. Therefore, detection of HHV-6 in blood, body fluids, or even tissue does not definitively establish a diagnosis of disease caused by HHV-6. Chromosomally integrated HHV-6, which results in high HHV-6 levels in virtually all clinical specimens, may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of active infection. HHV-6 can be cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (and other clinical specimens) [269]. However, viral isolation is labor-intensive, taking up to 21 days.

Disease is often biphasic beginning as a self-resolving, nonspecific febrile illness, followed by onset of rash and/or arthralgia approximately 1 week later. Importantly, the classic rash is immunologically mediated, as its appearance corresponds with development of an IgM antibody response to the virus. Serologic testing for the presence of IgM- and/or IgG-class antibodies to parvovirus B19 is the recommended diagnostic testing method for evaluation of a parvovirus B19 infection (Table 54). IgM-class antibodies to the virus are detectable within 10\u201312 days postinfection, with IgG detectable by 2 weeks [270\u2013272]. Notably, approximately 90% of patients presenting with erythema infectiosum have detectable IgM antibodies to parvovirus B19 at the time of presentation [272]. Antibodies to parvovirus B19 reach peak titers within 1 month, and while the presence of IgM-class antibodies suggests recent infection, they can persist for months. The presence of IgG antibodies alone is indicative of past exposure; these may remain detectable for life and are thought to provide lasting immunity to reinfection. Serologic testing for parvovirus B19 remains the recommended methodology for evaluation of pregnant women with possible exposure or infection; positive results for both IgM and IgG antibodies to parvovirus B19 suggest infection within the last 3 months and a possible risk of infection to the fetus.

IgM antibodies to measles may be detectable for a month or longer following disease onset and may also be positive in recently vaccinated individuals. A serologic diagnosis of acute measles may be established by demonstrating seroconversion of antimeasles IgG antibodies or a 4-fold rise in IgG titers between acute (collected at the time of rash onset) and convalescent (collected 10\u201330 days later) specimens (Table 55). Notably however, quantitative or semi-quantitative testing for antimeasles antibodies (ie, determining a titer) is no longer routinely available in local or reference laboratories. Measles virus can be isolated by culture or detected by NAAT from throat, nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs, or urine collected soon after rash onset; such testing is typically limited to public health laboratories [274].",

Diagnosis of DENV infection is most often established by serologic methods for detection of IgM- and/or IgG-class antibodies to the virus or detection of the DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen (Table 60). In cases of primary infection, IgM-class antibodies to DENV are detectable as early as 3\u20135 days after symptom onset and remain detectable for 2\u20133 months, whereas IgG antibodies to the virus appear 10\u201312 days after onset and are detectable for months to years [277].

An initially negative serologic profile for DENV in a patient for whom dengue fever is strongly suspected should be followed up with repeat serologic evaluation on a serum specimen collected 7\u201310 days after disease onset. Seroconversion to either anti-DENV IgM and/or IgG seropositivity is strongly suggestive of recent infection. However, due to the similar antigenic profiles between members of the Flavivirus genus, false-positive results for antibodies to DENV may occur in patients with a prior flavivirus infection (eg, West Nile virus, St Louis encephalitis virus, or Zika virus). Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) are considered the reference standard for detection of antibodies to arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) and provide improved specificity over commercial serologic assays; however, due to the complexity of testing, PRNT is currently only available at select public health laboratories and the CDC.",

IgM antibodies to WNV are detectable 3\u20138 days after symptom onset and often taper off 2\u20133 months later, though seropersistence in serum for up to 12 months has been documented. Seroconversion to anti-WNV IgM and/or IgG positivity between acute and convalescent sera (collected 7\u201310 days apart) is strongly suggestive of a recent WNV infection. The presence of anti-WNV IgG alone at the time of presentation is indicative of prior WNV infection, and evaluation for an alternative etiology is recommended. Serologic diagnosis of WNV CNS infection may be established by detection of IgM antibodies to WNV in CSF as antibodies in this class do not naturally cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. However, introduction of blood into the CSF during a traumatic lumbar puncture or defective permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier may lead to falsely elevated IgM levels in the CSF. False-positive results for both anti-WNV IgM and IgG antibodies may occur in patients who have been vaccinated against yellow fever virus or following natural infection with other flaviviruses (eg, dengue, St Louis encephalitis viruses). To rule out cross-reactivity, it is recommended that specimens reactive for WNV antibodies be tested by PRNT.",

Diagnostic tests available for ZIKV include NAATs for viral RNA, serologic evaluation for IgM antibodies to the virus, and PRNTs, considered the reference standard for detection of neutralizing antibodies to arboviruses (Table 71). Selection between these methodologies (ie, NAAT vs serology) is primarily dependent on when the patient presents in relation to symptom onset or last possible exposure to ZIKV [287]. Currently, the CDC recommends molecular testing by NAAT on serum and urine in symptomatic patients and pregnant women with illness duration of 14 days or less. While a positive NAAT result for ZIKV is diagnostic for infection, a negative result does not exclude infection as viremia or viruria may have passed by the time the specimen was collected. Patients negative by NAAT, particularly pregnant women, for whom ZIKV infection remains in the differential, should be evaluated using a serologic assay for antibodies to the virus. The most current guidelines and recommendations regarding evaluation and testing for ZIKV can be found on the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/index.html). False-positive ZIKV IgM serologic results may occur in patients with a prior or current infection with a closely related flavivirus, including WNV or DENV. Therefore, clinical decisions regarding patient management should not be based on a reactive ZIKV IgM serologic result alone. Confirmatory PRNTs for ZIKV neutralizing antibodies should be performed for all samples reactive by an anti-ZIKV IgM serologic assay. Finally, due to co-circulation of DENV and Chikungunya viruses in regions where ZIKV is endemic, and the often-times similar disease manifestation among these arboviruses, concurrent evaluation for DENV and Chikungunya virus should be considered.",

The thick film is made using 2\u20133 drops of blood that have been \u201claked\u201d (lysed) by placement into a hypotonic staining solution. This releases the intracellular parasites and allows for examination of multiple (20\u201330) layers of blood simultaneously. For this reason, it is the most sensitive method for microscopic screening and allows detection of very low levels of parasitemia (<0.001% of red blood cells [RBCs] infected) [293]. Use of the \u201cscratch method\u201d allows for improved adherence of the thick film to the slide and facilitates rapid examination (ie, it can be examined as soon as the blood is visibly dry) [294]. In contrast to thick films, thin films are prepared like a hematology peripheral smear and are fixed in ethanol before staining. Fixation retains the structure of the RBCs and intraerythrocytic parasites and provides ideal morphology for Plasmodium spp identification. It also allows for optimal evaluation and differentiation of Plasmodium from Babesia parasites, although the different Babesia spp cannot be distinguished from one another by morphology alone. Staining is best performed with Giemsa at a pH of 7.2 to highlight the microscopic features of the parasites. Wright-Giemsa and rapid Field stains are also acceptable.

Malaria RDTs provide cost-effective, rapid alternatives and can be used for screening when qualified technologists are not available [288]. These methods are rapid immunochromatographic tests using dipstick, card, or cassette formats in which a nitrocellulose membrane with bound parasite antigens are incorporated. The most commonly used antigens are Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase, Plasmodium aldolase, and P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2. There are a number of commercially available options, although the BinaxNow Malaria is currently the only test approved by the FDA. Depending on the number of antigens employed, RDTs may detect to the genus level, species level (most commonly P. falciparum), or both. In general, RDTs are somewhat less sensitive than thick blood films and may be falsely negative in cases with very low rates of parasitemia and non-falciparum infection [292]. The performance characteristics of the commercially available assays vary widely; the WHO provides several useful publications on the performance and selection of available malaria RDTs [292]. Given the lower sensitivity, positive RDTs should be confirmed by examination of thick and thin blood films, ideally within 12\u201324 hours of patient presentation. Blood film examination is also necessary for positive cases to confirm the species present and calculate the degree of parasitemia [295]. In the United States, Canada, and Europe, RDTs are primarily used for initial screening in settings where reliable blood films are not be readily available (evening shift, small community laboratories) or when the clinical situation is critical and an immediate diagnosis is required (stat laboratory in the emergency department). Such RDT testing should be followed as soon as possible by good-quality thick and thin blood film examination. It is important to note that RDTs may be falsely positive for several days after eradication of intact parasites since antigens may still be detected. Therefore, the assay should not be used to follow patients after adequate therapy has been given.",

IFA is the most readily available commercial assay for Babesia; IgM titers \u22651:16 and IgG titers \u22651:1024 indicate acute infection, as does a 4-fold rise in titer. IgG titers of 1:64\u20131:512 with negative IgM and no titer rises in serial specimens suggest previous infection or exposure. There is insufficient evidence for use in diagnosis of B. divergens, B. duncani, or MO-1 infections. Serology for Plasmodium spp is available through the CDC.",

These methods offer similar or improved sensitivity to the thick blood film and require no specialized parasitologic expertise. NAATs may be useful in accurate diagnosis of acute infection if blood films are negative or difficult to obtain and in the differentiation of malaria parasites from Babesia or nonparasitic artifacts. Finally, NAAT may provide diagnostic confirmation in cases empirically treated without prior laboratory diagnosis by detection of remnant nucleic acid. Because residual DNA can be detected days (or even weeks to months in asplenic persons) after intact parasites have been eradicated, NAATs should not be used to monitor response to therapy. When a NAAT is positive for Plasmodium or Babesia parasites, blood films must still be examined to determine the percentage parasitemia.",

The standard method for diagnosis of American trypanosomiasis during the acute phase of infection (4\u20138 weeks in length) is microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood or buffy coat films, since extracellular trypanosomes will be present at this time (Table 74). As with blood films for malaria and Babesia, a minimum amount of resources (staining materials and high-quality microscopes), as well as proficient and experienced technologists, must be available to obtain maximum accuracy and efficiency. On stained preparations, the motile trypomastigote forms typically adopt a \u201cC\u201d shape and can be differentiated from the similar-appearing trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma brucei by the presence in T. cruzi of a large posterior kinetoplast. In comparison, the kinetoplast of T. brucei trypomastigotes is much smaller. Of course, these infections can also be likely differentiated on epidemiologic grounds. Motile organisms can also be observed in fresh wet preparations of anticoagulated blood or buffy coat, although most US laboratories are unfamiliar with this method. Unfortunately, infection is rarely diagnosed in the acute stage since only 1%\u20132% of infected individuals present with symptoms during this time period [289, 290].",
