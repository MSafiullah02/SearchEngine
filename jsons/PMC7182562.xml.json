This can lead to retinal detachment and visual loss [1]. Regular screening and timely treatment are essential in improving anatomical and functional outcomes and should be part of routine neonatal care. During the 1940/50s and 1970s a first and a second epidemic of ROP blindness affected preterm babies in high-income countries and these were associated with the widespread use of unrestricted oxygen supplementation and increasing survival of infants at lower gestational age (GA) (<  28 weeks), respectively.",

In 2010, an estimated 184,700 preterm infants worldwide developed any stage of ROP, and more than 30,000 became visually impaired due to ROP [3]. In these middle income countries neonatal care is rapidly expanding, leading to greater survival of more immature, small for GA, and low-birth weight infants [2, 4]. In addition, suboptimal neonatal care, as a result of lack of awareness and resources, can lead to higher rates of severe ROP not only in extremely premature infants but also in larger, more mature infants [5, 6].",

In Rwanda, major advances in the survival of preterm infants have occurred recently due to improving neonatal care [13]. As a consequence, more extremely preterm infants are at risk of ROP. The recent presentation of several children born preterm with bilateral inoperable retinal detachment to an Ophthalmology Department in Rwanda prompted us to set up a screening system. A prospective observational study to document the incidence and risk factors for ROP was undertaken in Rwanda\u2019s three major neonatal intensive care units (NICU) with level 2 neonatal care (i.e. limited access to ventilation and no total parental nutrition).",

In cases of nasal cannula, supplemental unblended oxygen was delivered. Initially oxygen saturation was recorded but was felt to be too unreliable as a study variable. Sepsis was defined as early or late (starting 3 or more days after birth), necessitating antibiotic treatment for \u2265 5 days on clinical grounds and/or on the basis of a positive blood culture, if available. Blood transfusion was defined as the administration of adult red blood cells on one or more occasions. Hyperglycaemia was defined as serum glycemia \u2265 150 mg/dl sampled before a meal.",

Several studies from middle-income countries failed to identify oxygen exposure as an independent risk factor [9, 22, 23], while others have shown that improved oxygen delivery and adequate saturation targeting and monitoring in infants receiving oxygen can effectively decrease the incidence of ROP, even in rural areas [18, 24]. Assessing oxygen exposure reliably requires collecting accurate, continuous data on oxygen saturations\u2014which is difficult to capture. Fluctuation in saturation levels is also important [25], and in our study settings it was not possible to document oxygen saturations reliably. A recent prospectively planned meta-analysis of individual participant data from extremely preterm infants recruited to large-scale trials to compare different oxygen saturation targets, confirmed that the lower oxygen saturation target (range 85\u201389%) was associated with a lower risk of ROP treatment compared to the higher range (91\u201395%), but a higher risk of mortality [26]. Although oxygen levels are important in the pathogenesis of ROP [27], finding a balance in oxygen delivery to ensure adequate levels for survival [26], and at the same time reducing the risk of ROP is not easy. In addition, recommended oxygen saturation levels in extremely low birth weight infants in the postnatal period remain unclear [25, 26]. We found that CPAP was a safer way of oxygen administration in terms of ROP risk than nasal cannula as has been reported in some, but not all studies [9, 28]. Differences in the characteristics of the study populations may explain the differences. On the other hand, the administration of CPAP already implicates a closer surveillance of these patients.",

However, during the 2-year study neonatal care was introduced in several peripheral district hospitals, and ophthalmology departments witnessed an increasing number of preterm infants admitted for ROP treatment who had received care outside our study centres. Therefore, the incidence of ROP in our study may not reflect the overall incidence. This observation also suggests that the epidemic of ROP has only just begun in Rwanda and that screening needs to be expanded to these peripheral hospitals as well. Remote ROP screening using high-resolution wide-field imaging systems, with interpretation of the images at an off-site reading centre, would be one way to expand coverage, as has been implemented with success in middle and high-income countries with a shortage of eye healthcare professionals [33]. Recently the application of less expensive systems and even smartphones (iPhone 5 combined with 20D lens) have been described for ROP-screening [34]. This telemedicine approach might be an option for Rwanda, but care should be taken to train the photographers well, since visualising the peripheral retina, which is of vital importance in ROP screening, can be challenging.",

For example, loss to follow-up, which was in line with other studies from sub-Saharan Africa [9], may have biased the findings, particularly as those not followed up were born with a lower BW than those who were screened. Although there were no medical costs and transport costs were reimbursed, 17.1% of infants had insufficient screening episodes to ascertain the occurrence of ROP. Difficulties in completing screening following discharge from the NICU have been encountered in other communities [35, 36]. Further sensitisation of parents and health community on the importance of ROP screening is mandatory to reduce loss to follow-up. Screening before discharge from NICU even if the screening was not yet due, streamlined scheduling, and creation of a log for all patients seen, can improve follow-up after discharge [36, 37].",
