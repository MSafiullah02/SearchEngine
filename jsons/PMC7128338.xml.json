It is an inherently attractive compound to invoke as a measurement of the severity of a given infection. The compound, a pteridine derivative, is produced during the metabolism of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and monocytes and macrophages are the primary source of neopterin in humans [2]. It has therefore been regarded as a biochemical marker of cell-mediated immune response [3]. It is found in multiple body fluids including serum, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid.",

The manuscript by Zheng et al. is notable as it suggests there is test that can be performed early that accurately reflects severity of disease later in the course of infection. Other markers for severity of illness have been proposed including C reactive protein, LDH, increased age, severity of illness, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count [24], [25]. However, the delineation was rarely as robust as suggested with neopterin in this manuscript. Prospective measurements of neopterin in a group of well-characterized patients infected with SARS-CoV will be necessary to validate the use of this test as a predictor of disease severity. If substantiated, neopterin may be useful to delineate a population at low risk for severe disease and therefore define a population which may not benefit from exposure to corticosteroids.",
