According to data from China, an estimated 10\u201315% of mild cases progress to severe, and 15\u201320% of severe cases go on to become critical, with many of those in the latter category requiring treatment in intensive care units (ICU) (Wu and McGoogan 2020). To maximise the use of scarce health system resources, it is imperative to identify those at risk of progressing to severe and critical illness with COVID-19. It is thought that age and underlying chronic conditions (or comorbidities) increase the risk of severe COVID-19 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020a), but the differential effect of various comorbidities remains unclear, and current guidance is largely based on expert consensus rather than observational data.",

There have been a number of meta-analyses on COVID-19 severity conducted to date (Henry and Lippi 2020; Yang et al. 2020a; Li et al. 2020a), but none of these investigated the predictive value of symptoms, nor separated severe disease from ICU admission (which represents the upper end of severity) when investigating the impact of comorbidities. Through separately analysing patients admitted to ICU, this study aims to better assess the most important symptoms and comorbidities for those with very severe (or critical) disease. This will help to inform public health actions aiming to protect the most vulnerable from acquiring COVID-19 and may also guide efforts on early intervention and resource allocation, through informing the design of clinical pathways and risk stratification tools. Deaths from COVID-19 can also be investigated as an outcome of very severe (or critical) disease. But, if done through routine sources (for instance, using death certificates), this would not allow an analysis of predictive symptoms. Moreover, since many patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 survive, predictors for death may differ from those for ICU admission.",

Two reviewers (VG, JMY) independently screened the list of titles and abstracts, and the full text of chosen manuscripts. Disagreements on which manuscripts to include during both title and abstract screen, and the subsequent full-text analysis, were discussed until a conclusion was reached. In addition to the MEDLINE/EMBASE/Global Health search, citation tracking was used to identify any remaining relevant published studies, though none were identified.

To avoid selection bias, no subjective quality criteria were applied to the studies for inclusion.

Some studies reported heart disease and stroke separately (Guan et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020). To allow comparability between studies for meta-analysis, these were grouped into a single predictor (cardiovascular disease). One study was excluded from the analysis of dyspnoea as a predictor of severity, as dyspnoea was part of the definition for severity used by the authors (Tian et al. 2020). Smoking was not included in meta-analyses as the three papers including data on smoking (Guan et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020) were distributed across both severe and ICU groups, rather than reporting consistently on one (or both) of these outcome measures.",

            "text": "Appraising with the STROBE checklist highlighted several major weaknesses in the included studies. Firstly, there was no consistent definition on what constituted severe disease. The WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 defined a severe case as tachypnoea (\u2265 30 breaths/min) or oxygen saturation \u2264 93% at rest, or PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg (WHO-China Joint Mission 2020). Critical cases were defined as respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock or other organ failure that requires intensive care. Although the above criteria were used in some included studies (Xu et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020a), many defined only one out of severe and critical, with one (Li et al. 2020b) using a definition for a single severe/critical cohort. One study reported both severe and critical cases (Guan et al. 2020), using criteria set by the American Thoracic Society. Secondly, the time at which severity of disease was determined was not always clear. Severity was assessed on admission in two studies (Guan et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020), whilst three studies did not specify when severity was assessed (Li et al. 2020b; Tian et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020). It is possible, therefore, that the non-severe group included patients who went on to later develop severe disease. Thirdly, the time point at which symptoms were measured varied from illness onset (via recall) (Huang et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Tian et al. 2020) to clinical presentation (Guan et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2020). In one study, it was not clear when symptoms were measured (Li et al. 2020b). Finally, no study specified how each individual symptom or comorbidity was measured. For instance, it was unclear whether fever was objectively measured, and if so, how or by whom.",

We found that the prevalence of dyspnoea in the ICU group was 67.2%, compared with 10.2% in the non-ICU group. Although dyspnoea by definition may be indicative of lung involvement and therefore more severe disease, there have been reports of \u2018silent hypoxia\u2019, where oxygen saturations can fall and precipitate acute respiratory failure in the absence of dyspnoea and other symptoms of respiratory distress (Gattinoni et al. 2020). The significant association of dyspnoea in this analysis with severe disease and ICU admission suggests that most patients who progress to severe illness do not have \u2018silent hypoxia\u2019. It should be noted though, that the reported strength of dyspnoea as a predictor for severe disease and ICU admission could be affected by selection bias since patients without dyspnoea (but with severe disease) may be less likely to be admitted to hospital in the first instance. The median time from illness onset to dyspnoea is 5\u20138 days, and the median time from illness onset to ICU admission has been reported as 10\u201312 days (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020b). One of the studies included in our meta-analysis found patients admitted to ICU had a longer duration of symptoms before hospitalisation compared to those not requiring ICU care (Wang et al. 2020). Given the importance of dyspnoea in predicting ICU admission, future research should aim to assess the value of early hospital admission, clinical intervention and close community-based monitoring in patients with dyspnoea.",

Our study found similar results with high rates of these comorbidities in severe and ICU groups. For diabetes, a meta-analysis of six studies (1527 patients) found the prevalence to be twice as high in the ICU/severe group compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients (Li et al. 2020a). On disaggregating this outcome into two (severe disease and ICU admitted), we found the prevalence of diabetes to be 2.9 times higher in the severe group (compared to non-severe) and 3.6 times higher in the ICU group (compared to non-ICU).",

Given that 70% of 2249 intensive care patients in the UK are male (Intensive care national audit & research centre 2020), and that, of the patients who have died from COVID-19 in Italy, 80% were male (Remuzzi and Remuzzi 2020), this is consistent with empirical data.

These can also be formalised within risk stratification tools to aid clinical decision-making, such as the CURB65 tool for community-acquired pneumonia (Lim et al. 2003). As the number of hospitalised COVID-19 cases continues to increase, hospitals will increasingly need to ration limited resources and improve clinical pathways to effectively prioritise patients with greatest clinical need. Anticipation of future demand, based on local population characteristics, may enable more timely planning and resource mobilisation (Yang et al. 2020b).
