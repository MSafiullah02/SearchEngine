Vitamin E, a lipidsoluble antioxidant vitamin, is important for normal function of the immune cells. The elderly are at a greater risk for vitamin E intake that is lower than recommended levels. Vitamin E supplementation above currently recommended levels has been shown to improve immune functions in the aged including delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response and antibody production in response to vaccination, which was shown to be mediated through increased production of interleukin (IL)-2, leading to enhanced proliferation of T cells, and through reduced production of prostaglandin E 2 , a T-cell suppressive factor, as a result of a decreased peroxynitrite formation. Vitamin E increased both cell-dividing and IL-producing capacities of na\u00efve T cells, but not memory T cells. The vitamin E-induced enhancement of immune functions in the aged was associated with significant improvement in resistance to influenza infection in aged mice and a reduced risk of acquiring upper respiratory infections in nursing home residents. Further studies are needed to determine the signaling mechanisms involved in the upregulation of na\u00efve T-cell function by vitamin E as well as the specific mechanisms involved in reduction of risk for upper respiratory infections.",

Immune cells are particularly enriched in vitamin E because their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content puts them at especially high risk for oxidative damage (1, 2) . Free-radical damage to immune cell membrane lipids may ultimately impair their ability to respond normally to pathogenic challenge. Available evidence suggests beneficial effects of supplemental vitamin E on immune function and related diseases. Vitamin E is perhaps one of the most studied nutrients in relation to its immunoregulatory effect. Results from animal and human studies indicate that vitamin E deficiency impairs both humoral and cell-mediated immune functions (3, 4) , while supplementation with vitamin E above the recommended levels has been shown to enhance immune response and to be associated with increased resistance against several pathogens (5, 6) .",

There are eight naturally occurring forms of vitamin E: a-, b-, g-, and d-tocopherols and a-, b-, g-, and d-tocotrienols (Fig. 1) . Chemically synthesized a-tocopherol contains eight stereoisomers and is designated all-rac-a-tocopherol (historically and incorrectly called dl-a-tocopherol), while naturally occurring stereoisomer of a-tocopherol is RRR-a-tocopherol (formerly called d-a-tocopherol). It has been generally accepted that biological activities of different forms of vitamin E correlate with antioxidant activities in the order of a > b > g > d (10) . However, recent studies (11, 12) suggest that biological effects of vitamin E may not necessarily correlate with antioxidant activities of different forms of vitamin E. Since 1980, one international unit (IU) of vitamin E has been defined as 1 mg of all-rac-a-tocopheryl acetate, 0.67 mg of RRR-a-tocopherol, or 0.74 mg of RRR-a-tocopheryl acetate. These differences in definitions of units among different forms of a-tocopherol are based on rat fetal absorption assay and adjustment for the differences in molecular weights of esters of a-tocopherol (13) .",

De Waart et al. (20) observed no significant changes in mitogenic response to ConA and PHA or levels of IgG and IgA against Penicillium after 3-month supplementation with vitamin E at 100 mg/day. The lower dose of vitamin E as well as the use of previously frozen lymphocytes for determination of mitogenic response and evaluation of antibody levels without previous specific vaccination may have contributed to the discrepancy observed between the results of De Waart et al. (20) and those of Meydani et al. (5, 18) and Lee and Wan (9) . Pallast et al. (21) supplemented healthy elderly subjects (65 -80 years old) with 50 or 100 mg/day of vitamin E for 6 months. Subjects in the vitamin E-supplemented group showed a significant increase in DTH (induration diameter and number of positive responses) compared with their own baseline values. Only the change in the number of positive DTH responses tended to be larger in the 100 mg-supplemented group than the placebo group (P \u00bc 0.06). A significantly greater improvement in cumulative DTH score and the number of positive DTH responses was observed in a subgroup of subjects who received 100 mg of vitamin E and had a low-baseline DTH reactivity. There was no significant difference in PHA-stimulated IL-2 production between the vitamin E-treated groups relative to the placebo group. Differences in results among human studies may reflect the differences in vitamin E status at baseline and supplementation dose resulting in varied levels of changes in plasma vitamin E levels and methodology (Fig. 3) . Considering the results from the study by Meydani et al. (18) in which subjects in the upper tertile of serum vitamin E concentration (>48.4 mmol/l) after supplementation had higher antibody response to hepatitis B as well as higher DTH responses than those in the lower tertile of serum vitamin E (19.9 -34.7 mmol/l), the amount of increase in vitamin E levels achieved in the studies by others (20, 21) might not have been adequate to observe a highly significant effect. It is also noteworthy that Lee and Wan (9) observed a significant increase in cell-mediated immune response with a 13.4 mmol/l increase in plasma vitamin E level, a level of increase comparable to those observed by De Waart et al. (20) and Pallast et al. (21) with 100 mg supplementation. A difference in baseline vitamin E status may explain the varied results observed in these latter studies, as subjects in the study by Lee and Wan (9) As shown in Fig. 3 , changes in plasma vitamin E levels up to 25 mmol/l is linearly associated with a change in DTH response. Further increase in plasma vitamin E level, however, does not seem to be associated with an additional improvement in DTH. A 25 mmol/l increase in plasma vitamin E can be achieved by consuming 200 mg/day of vitamin E.",

Thus, we proposed that the enhancing effect of vitamin E on T-cell-mediated function might be attributed in part to its inhibition of PGE 2 production. In a coculture study, Beharka et al. (22) isolated Mf and T cells from young (6 months) and old (23 months) C57BL mice and preincubated the cells in the presence of 20 mg/ml of vitamin E or vehicle solution. Mf and T cells from young or old mice, preincubated with or without vitamin E, were added together in different combinations and stimulated by ConA. The results showed that supplementation of both T cells and Mf from old mice with vitamin E significantly increased T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production by old T cells compared to those of control culture. When either Mf or T cell was supplemented with vitamin E, these changes were still present, but the magnitude of the increase was smaller. When vitamin E-supplemented Mf from old mice were added to cocultures containing T cells from young mice, proliferation, but not IL-2 production, was improved. These results indicate that vitamin E improves T-cell function in aged by two mechanisms: (i) by directly affecting T cells, and (ii) indirectly by reducing Mf and PGE 2 production. ",

            "text": "Among the T-cell suppressive factors produced by Mf, PGE 2 is the most prominent and thus most intensively studied. While PGE 2 is necessary for T-cell function, at higher concentrations, it has been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation, including both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, with CD4 + T cells being most affected and thus the focus of majority of the studies. This effect of PGE 2 on T-cell function is the consequence of altered early signaling events in T-cell activation (23) and results in altered cytokine profile of T cells. PGE 2 has been consistently shown to inhibit Th1 cytokine IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-g production as well as IL-2 receptor expression (24, 25) . On the other hand, depending on the stimulation condition, PGE 2 upregulates or has no effect on the production of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 (26). Thus PGE 2 , in general, promotes a shift in T-cell cytokine production from Th1 type to Th2 type. Studies have shown that Mf and spleen cells from old mice and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from elderly human subjects synthesize significantly more PGE 2 than their young counterparts (5, 7, 27, 28) . In a study by Franklin et al. (29) , addition of peritoneal Mf from old rats to splenocytes from young rats significantly inhibited ConA-stimulated splenocyte proliferation; this inhibitory effect was also observed when PGE 2 was added. These findings were further confirmed and extended by Beharka et al. (22) who showed that cocultures of Mf isolated from old mice with T cells from young mice exhibited lower T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production compared to those of young Mf with young T cell. Exogenous addition of PGE 2 , at the concentrations produced by old Mf, decreased T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production by young T cells. Addition of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin or antioxidant nutrient vitamin E inhibited PGE 2 production and improved T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production. The association between PGE 2 and age-associated decrease in T-cell-mediated immune response was further supported by in vivo studies (5, 7) , which showed that dietary vitamin E supplementation to old mice and human subjects improved their T-cell proliferation, IL-2 production, and DTH response. In these studies, improved T-cell-mediated immune response was accompanied by a reduced PGE 2 production (Fig. 2) . Taken together, these results suggest a key role for PGE 2 in T-cell immunosenescence.",

            "text": "Like other eicosanoids, biosynthesis of PGE 2 is accomplished in a metabolic cascade starting from its precursor fatty acid, arachidonic acid (AA) (Fig. 4) . AA is present in membrane phospholipids and released by the hydrolytic action of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ). Released AA is metabolized to unstable intermediate prostanoids by COX, also called PGH 2 synthase. COX has bifunctional catalytic properties. It oxygenates and cyclizes AA to form PGG 2 via its COX function, and this is followed by the reduction of PGG 2 to PGH 2 via its peroxidase function. PGH 2 is then converted to PGE 2 by the terminal synthase, PGE 2 synthase (PGES). PGE 2 synthesis is mainly determined by the availability of the substrate AA and the activity of enzyme COX. As AA in total cellular fatty acid or in phospholipids fraction has been shown either to remain unchanged or to decrease with age, we focused on the ratelimiting enzyme COX.",

In contrast, COX-2 is regulated by growth factors, tumor promoters, cytokines, mitogens, glucocorticoids, and bacterial endotoxin, and is implicated in inflammatory responses and pathological changes in numerous disorders. Recently, the presence of a third form of COX, referred to as COX-3, has been proposed (30); however, little is known about its significance.",

They first showed that LPSstimulated peritoneal Mf from old (24 months) C57BL/6NIA mice produced more PGE 2 than those from young (6 months). PGE 2 measured in this manner represents its accumulated synthesis utilizing endogenous substrate AA with all three enzymatic reactions, i.e. PLA 2 , COX, and PGE synthetase (PGES) involved. Thus, to test the hypothesis that ageassociated increase in PGE 2 is due to an increase in COX activity, Hayek et al. (31) compared COX activity between young and old Mf in the presence of adequate level of AA and showed that COX activity was significantly higher in old compared to young Mf. PGES is not considered a ratelimiting factor in PGE 2 production, although recent publications suggested that it couples to COX and may participate in regulation of PGE 2 synthesis.",

            "text": "Ceramide is a sphingolipid second messenger generated from the hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin under the action of sphingomyelinase (SMase), or by de novo synthesis. Ceramide is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis through multiple signaling pathways (37) . LPS can induce intracellular ceramide generation, while ceramide and SMase mimic LPS action in murine Mf (38) . Age-related increase in brain and liver ceramide and neutral SMase levels has been reported (39) (40) (41) Binding of LPS to its receptor CD14 at Mf surface triggers the activation of IkB kinase (IKK) complex, including IKKa, IKKb, and IKKg/ NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO), downstream of TRAF-6. IKK is a major kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of IkB. Phosphorylated IkB is further ubiquitinated and eventually degraded, leaving the NF-kB dimer free to translocate to nucleus. IkB degradation is increased in murine Mf, which results in an increased translocation of dimer to nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-kB binds to the promoter region of COX-2 gene and initiates its transcription. The resulting mRNA of COX-2 encodes synthesis of COX-2 enzyme. COX-2 catalyzes metabolism of AA to PGH 2, which is further isomerized to PGE 2 . The age-associated increase in activation leads to higher expression of COX-2, COX-2 activity, and PGE 2 production. Although only the LPS-induced activation pathway is illustrated here, age-associated upregulation in COX-2 expression and transcription process is not stimulus-specific. The higher COX-2 expression in old Mf is shown to be due to higher level of sphingolipid ceramide. LPS-stimulated Mf produce more ceramide in old than in young mice. Ceramide upregulates COX-2 expression through NF-kB activation. Ceramide addition to young Mf increases COX-2-specific NF-kB activation, COX-2 expression, and PGE2 production. Ceramide-induced COX-2 upregulation is diminished in the presence of NF-kB decoy or IkB inhibitor. The mechanism by which ceramide activates NF-kB degradation can only be speculated at this time (shown as dotted lines) and remains to be determined. Vitamin E inhibits COX activity but has no effect on expression levels of protein and mRNA of either COX-1 or COX-2.Vitamin E modulates COX activity post-translationally, through its inhibitory effect on the production of peroxynitrite, a molecule shown to enhance COX activity without affecting COX enzyme expression. Mf from old mice produce more NO than those from young mice. Vitamin E reduces NO production, and thus peroxynitrite synthesis. et al. (42) found that endogenous levels of ceramide and neutral SMase activity are significantly elevated as the cells entered the senescent phase. Thus, we hypothesized that ceramide might mediate the age-associated increase in COX-2 expression and thus PGE 2 production. This was supported by the work of Claycombe et al. (32) , which showed that Mf from old mice generate significantly more intracellular ceramide than those from young mice within 30 -60 min of LPS stimulation. Addition of exogenous ceramide to the Mf from young mice dose-dependently increased PGE 2 production and COX activity. Ceramide also further enhanced LPS-stimulated PGE 2 production and COX-2 protein expression. This effect of ceramide was shown to be due to its stimulatory effect on COX-2 mRNA transcription (32) .",

The binding sites for several nuclear transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), nuclear factor interleukin-6, and cAMP-responsive element (CRE), have been identified on the promoter region of the COX-2 gene (43) (44) (45) . Another redox-sensitive transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1), has also been shown to be involved in COX-2-transcriptional regulation by binding to the CRE binding site (46, 47) . No significant difference in LPS-stimulated AP-1 or CREB activity was found between young and old Mf. However, NF-kB-binding activity, both consensus and COX-2 specific, was higher in old Mf compared to that of young (33) . Further studies indicated that the higher NF-kB activation might be due to increased IkB degradation. The link between NF-kB activity and COX-2 activation was supported by the observation that COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, COX activity, and PGE 2 production were reduced when activation was blocked by using either a pharmacological inhibitor of IkB phosphorylation or a specific NF-kB decoy (33) . The authors further showed that ceramide stimulates by itself and also potentiates LPS-induced PGE 2 production and COX-2 expression, and this effect of ceramide was mediated through inducing NF-kB activation (33) . A summary of different steps involved in age-associated upregulation of COX-2 and the role of ceramide and NF-kB is presented in Fig. 4 .",

At the end of the feeding period, LPS-stimulated Mf from old mice fed the control diet had significantly higher production of PGE 2 at 12 and 24 h compared to those from young mice fed the control diet. Furthermore, Wu et al (48) . showed that vitamin E exerts its effect by decreasing COX-2 activity. However, LPSinduced COX-2 protein expression was not altered by vitamin E supplementation, and similarly, COX-2 mRNA expression was not affected. Thus, the vitamin E-induced decrease in COX activity of Mf from old mice is not due to its regulation of COX transcription or translation; rather, it appears that vitamin E exerts its effect post-translationally (Fig. 4) . Similarly, other investigators (49, 50) reported no effect of vitamin E on COX expression.",

It has been suggested that NO stimulates COX activity via direct stimulation of the enzyme (54). LPSstimulated peritoneal Mf from old mice were shown to produce more NO than those from young mice (55, 56) , while dietary supplementation with vitamin E was shown to reduce NO production in Mf from old mice (55) . NO can be further metabolized to peroxynitrite (ONOO) in the presence of superoxide, and ONOO has been shown to increase the activity of COX without affecting its expression (57) . Therefore, we hypothesized that decreased NO and thus ONOO formation may mediate the inhibition of COX activity by vitamin E. This hypothesis was tested in a study conducted by Beharka et al. (55) in which young (6 months) and old (24 months) mice were fed 30 (control) or 500 ppm (supplementation) vitamin E for 30 days. Results from this study confirmed previous findings that Mf from old mice produced more NO than those from young mice. Furthermore, the age-associated increase of NO was reduced by vitamin E supplementation. Vitamin E supplementation did not affect LPS-induced superoxide generation, but reduced the further potentiated superoxide generation in the presence of superoxide-generating agents. Addition of NO donor to cell culture to increase NO levels did not change PGE 2 production and COX activity in either young or old mice. However, when NO donor was added in the presence of superoxide to elevate ONOO levels in the culture, vitamin E-induced inhibition in COX activity in the Mf from old mice was diminished. On the other hand, when NO and superoxide inhibitors were added to Mf from old mice fed control diet to block generation of ONOO, COX activity was significantly reduced. These results suggest that vitamin E reduces COX activity in old Mf by decreasing NO production, which leads to lower production of ONOO in Mf from old mice (Fig. 4) .",

To evaluate if vitamin E has a direct, PGE 2 -independent effect on T-cell responses, T cells purified from the spleens of young and old mice were preincubated with vitamin E or vehicle control (58) . Activation-induced cell division of T cells from old mice was lower than that by young, and the production of IL-2 following 48-h activation was less by T cells from old mice. The defect in proliferation and IL-2 production was specific to na\u00efve T cells and was not observed in memory T cells. Furthermore, there was an age-related decline in both the number of IL-2 + T cells and the amount of IL-2 produced per cell and an age-related decline in cell division within na\u00efve T-cell subpopulation (Fig. 5A,B) . Vitamin E increased both cell-dividing capability, total IL-2 production as well as the number of IL-2 + T cells, and the amount of IL-2 produced per na\u00efve T cell (Fig. 5A,B) . These data indicate that na\u00efve T cells exhibit the greatest age-related defect and show that supplemental vitamin E has a direct immunoenhancing effect on na\u00efve T cells from old mice. The differential effect of vitamin E on na\u00efve and memory T cells may be due to an underlying difference in the susceptibility of these cells to oxidative stress-induced damage (59) .",

The mechanisms through which vitamin E improves cell-cycle division and IL-2 production are currently under investigation. Vitamin E may impact several different steps of the activation and proliferation process such as effective immune synapse formation, free-radical-sensitive signaltransduction pathways or cell-cycle-related molecules. Our preliminary results indicate that vitamin E may improve effective immune synapse formation in na\u00efve T cells from old mice (60) . In addition, microarray analysis of gene-expression profiles of purified T cells indicated that vitamin E supplementation in old mice increased the expression of cell-cyclerelated proteins, including cyclin B, Cdc2 (Cdk1), and Cdc6 (61) . Cyclin B and Cdc2 are important for entry of cells into M-phase of the cell cycle, and Cdc6 is a key regulator in early step of DNA replication (62, 63) . Additional ongoing studies would further determine the key steps in na\u00efve T-cell activation and cell-cycle division, which are influenced by vitamin E.",

Most of the animal studies that investigated the effect of vitamin E on infectious diseases reported a protective effect despite the variations in the dose and duration of the supplementation, infectious organisms involved, and route of administration. Vitamin E supplementation in old mice resulted in significantly lower viral titer on 2, 5, and 7 days postinfection and preserved antioxidant nutrient status following influenza virus infection. A significant inverse correlation was observed between hepatic vitamin E levels and lung viral titers (6, 64) . Preservation of antioxidant status might protect tissues from oxidative stress caused by the virus itself or by the host's effector mechanisms. Han et al. (65) showed that vitamin E supplementation of old mice infected with influenza significantly increased production of IL-2 and IFN-g. The change in IFN-g production significantly correlated with the decrease in viral titer. These results suggest that the enhancement of Th1 response is one of the mechanisms through which vitamin E provides protection against influenza infection in the old mice. Dysregulation of Th1 and Th2 functions are observed with aging. Decreased production of and responsiveness to IL-2 as a result of aging have been demonstrated (66) . In addition, aged mice were shown to have decreased ability to produce IFN-g following infection with Legionella pneumophilia or influenza virus (65, 67, 68) . These changes in Th1/Th2 balance can contribute to delayed clearance and recovery from influenza infection. Th1 clones are cytolytic in vitro against influenza-infected target cells, and adoptive transfer of a Th1 clone protects against lethal challenge with influenza virus in vivo (69, 70) . Whereas, Th2 clones are noncytolytic and failed to promote recovery from lethal infection after adoptive transfer (70) . Furthermore, in vivo treatment with IL-4 suppressed CTL response and IFN-g production, and delayed viral clearance (71) . Only a limited number of studies have investigated the effect of vitamin E on resistance against infections in humans. The subjects in these studies were mainly elderly. Infections, particularly respiratory infections, are common in the elderly, resulting in decreased daily activity, prolonged recovery times, increased health care service utilization, and more frequent complications, including death (72) (73) (74) .",

Thus, our finding that vitamin E supplementation reduces the common cold by 22% has significant implications for the elderly in reducing the burden of diseases and associated health care costs. Currently, there are 34 million elderly in the US. The observation that vitamin E reduced the risk for acquiring all respiratory infections by 20% will translate into about 7 million fewer elderly acquiring respiratory infection.",

Hemila et al. (95) evaluated the effect of longterm vitamin E and beta-carotene supplementation on the incidence of common cold episodes from a cohort of 21 796 male smokers from the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. Common cold episodes were queried three times per year during a 4-year follow-up period. Fifty milligram of vitamin E supplementation resulted in slightly lower incidence of cold among subjects 65 years of age or older (RR \u00bc 0.95); this reduction was the greatest among older city dwellers who smoked fewer than 15 cigarettes per day (RR \u00bc 0.72). A recent double-blind trial of Dutch elderly (96) living in the community reported a rate ratio for all RI among those receiving vitamin E as 1.12 (95% CI \u00bc 0.88-1.25), compared to those not receiving vitamin E. The Dutch study differed from that of Meydani et al. (84) in terms of the population and the way that respiratory infections were diagnosed. While our subjects were institutionalized elderly, their incidence of respiratory infection was similar to the community-dwelling Dutch elderly (96) . Furthermore, we have previously shown that vitamin E is effective in improving the immune response in community-dwelling elderly (5, 18) , and although it did not have sufficient power to demonstrate statistical significance, one of these studies showed a 30% reduction of infection in independently living elderly (18) .",

However, absence of infection in those not reporting was not confirmed, thus making the study results susceptible to reporting biases. In our study, the presence and type of RI, or absence, was documented by infectious disease specialists based on review of data gathered by trained research nurses during weekly subject interviews, review of medical records, and physical examination focused on respiratory infections using standardized case definitions (76, 90, (97) (98) (99) . Furthermore, our results indicate that vitamin E reduces upper respiratory infections, particularly common colds, with no effect on lower respiratory infections or seasonal allergies. Graat et al. (96) did not differentiate between types of infections or between respiratory infection and allergies, and thus might have overlooked any vitamin E effect on upper respiratory infections. In addition, in our study adherence was checked by nursing home medication records and by periodic plasma vitamin E measurements, whereas the Graat et al. (96) study measured plasma vitamin E levels only at baseline. Table 2 summarizes the results from animal and human studies that investigated the effects of vitamin E supplementation on infectious diseases in aged animals and humans.",

A doseresponse relationship can be demonstrated between delayedtype hypersensitivity skin response and plasma vitamin E levels up to 25 mmol/l of increase in plasma vitamin E levels following supplementation. Elderly with higher plasma vitamin E levels also had a better response to hepatitis B vaccine than those with lower plasma vitamin E levels. Results from cellular and molecular mechanistic studies have shown that immunoregulatory effects of vitamin E are mediated indirectly by reducing the production of suppressive factors such as PGE 2 by Mf and directly by increasing cell-division capacity and IL-2 production by na\u00efve T cells. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of vitamin E-induced enhancement of na\u00efve T-cell function. Preliminary studies indicate that vitamin E might affect membrane-associated early events in activation of T cells.",

Recent clinical trials also suggest beneficial effect of vitamin E supplementation in reducing the risk of upper respiratory infections, particularly common cold in the elderly. Further controlled clinical trials in humans are required to determine if the beneficial effect of vitamin E in elderly is specific to viral infections or can be extended to other pathogens. The observation that a single nutrient can reverse/reduce specific age-related defects in immune response is encouraging, as nutrient supplementation presents a practical and inexpensive strategy to reduce the burden of immune-related diseases in elderly.",

Purified T cells were preincubated with 46 mM vitamin E for 4 h, labeled with carboxyfluoroscein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), and activated with immobilized anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 mAb for 48 h. Cells were harvested, stained for CD44 expression, and analyzed on a flow cytometer. One representative histogram for each of young control (a, b, and c), old control (d, e, and f), and old preincubated with vitamin E (g, h, and i) are shown. Cell-cycle division patterns are shown for unactivated T cells (a, d, and g), activated na\u00efve (CD44 lo ) T cells (b, e, and h), and activated memory (CD44 hi ) T cells (c, f, and i). Peaks representing cell division cycles 0, 1, and 2 are also indicated. (B) Effect of age and vitamin E on intracellular IL-2 production by na\u00efve and memory T-cell subsets. Purified T cells (n \u00bc 5) were preincubated with 46 mM vitamin E for 4 h and activated with immobilized anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 mAb for 48 h. Cells were treated with monensin, an inhibitor of IL-2 secretion, for the last 10 h of activation. Harvested cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD44 mAb, permeabilized, and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-IL-2. T cells were divided into na\u00efve and memory phenotypes based on low or high expression of the CD44 antigen, respectively. Cell fluorescence was measured on a flow cytometer. Bars represent the linearized mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IL-2 + T cells. Bars with different letters within each phenotype are significantly different (P < 0.05) by an ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD posthoc procedure. Reproduced with permission from Adolfsson et al.
