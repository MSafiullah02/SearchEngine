Our previous studies were conducted focusing on the noncontact dengue fever detecting systems based on multiple vital signs using medical radar and thermography. For example, [[4], [5], [6], [7]] developed methods that processed the recorded signal to obtain heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) by built-in algorithms, namely Autocorrelation, Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), on computer software. However, those research studies used built-in algorithms with fixed parameters regardless of the age and sex of subjects, which could reduce the accuracy of the system. Regarding the task of discriminating patients with infectious diseases, [6] employed the Linear Discriminant Analysis method on a small dataset of 18 samples, which achieved an indifferent accuracy level of 88.9%. Moreover, [[8], [9], [10]] employed sophisticated methods using Neural Networks. However, this approach required high computational complexity to train the Neural Network, partly because it was susceptible to the variability in age and gender.",

To measure vital signs, a Digital Butterworth filter [11] and a simple time-domain peak detection algorithm were deployed to process the signal acquired from medical radar. To deal with the variability in HR [12] and RR [13,14] depending on age and gender, instead of the inflexible methods used in Refs. [[4], [5], [6], [7]], filters with flexible cut-off frequencies were designed in this work. For the classification problem, two machine learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) [15] and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) [16] were used, with a far larger dataset of 101 samples, than the 18-sample dataset in Ref. [6], to increase the classification accuracy. Moreover, those algorithms were implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), since one of the long range objectives of this study is to enable a low-cost, portable, and standalone system, which would be beneficial for public health centers in underdeveloped areas, where people have little access to healthcare, thus they have higher risks of succumbing to infectious diseases. FPGAs have been widely used for multiple signal processing problems, especially filtering [17,18], due to their flexible and reconfigurable structure. Moreover, research focusing on FPGA implementations of machine-learning problems, such as classification, has been thriving in recent years [[19], [20], [21]], since the flexibility, parallelism and energy- efficiency of FPGAs are beneficial for accelerating complicated work. In this study, the FPGA called PYNQ-Z1 was employed to implement all signal processing and classification algorithms.",

However, its drawback is that when the model needs a number of hyperparameters, the optimizing process can be very time-consuming.

In contrast, the SVM required 403 ms for training the model, nearly 90 times as high as the training time of the QDA. It was probably because the SVM includes an iterative procedure to solve the constrained optimization problem, whereas training the QDA classifier only requires a fixed number of steps for basic matrix operations. In practical purposes, all machine learning models can be trained prior to testing; thus the predicting time appears to outweigh the training time. Therefore, on balanced, the performance of the SVM model appeared to be superior.",
