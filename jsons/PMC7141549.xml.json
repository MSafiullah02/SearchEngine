Aggressive actions should be taken immediately to mitigate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In their Comment, Yonghong Xiao and Mili Estee Torok1 rightly stated that infection prevention and control measures should be based on sound scientific principles. However, we disagree with the authors' views on certain measures that they consider to have \u201cno scientific basis and have proven to be ineffective\u201d. A difference exists between measures with unknown effectiveness and those that have been proven ineffective or of no value.",
