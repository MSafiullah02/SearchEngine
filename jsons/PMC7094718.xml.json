It has been shown that the IL-8 level is elevated in the plasma of SARS patients [18]. When the reporter plasmids expressing luciferase under the control of the human wild-type IL-8 promoter (-133-Luc) [11] were co-transfected in HEK293T cells, IL-8 promoter activity was enormously augmented by expression of 3a/X1 (28.7-fold) and 7a/X4 (13.2-fold). The effects of 3b/X2, 6/X3, and 8b/X5 were not significant (Fig. 4\nA). Augmentation of the IL-8 promoter activity by 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 was abolished by a mutation at the NF-\u03baB site in the IL-8 promoter, indicating that this effect was mainly mediated through NF-\u03baB (Fig. 4B).",
