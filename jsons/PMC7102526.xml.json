On the basis of homology, KPNA subtypes are classified into three subfamilies: \u03b11 (KPNA1, KPNA5 and KPNA6), \u03b12 (KPNA2 and KPNA7) and \u03b13 (KPNA3 and KPNA4) (Pumroy and Cingolani, 2015; Smith et al., 2018). The three subfamilies of KPNA show distinct NLS-binding specificity (Nadler et al., 1997) and exhibit multiple biological functions including cell development and differentiation, regulation of the immune response and control of tumorigenesis.",

Several KPNA4 orthologues from different species including humans (K\u00f6hler et al., 1997), mice (Mihalas et al., 2015), pigs (Chen et al., 2016) and chickens (Caldwell et al., 2005) have been identified. In mammals, human KPNA4, a specific adaptor molecule, mediates the nuclear import of interferon (IFN) transcriptional regulators, such as NF-\u03baB p50/p65 heterodimers and IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3, thereby regulating type I IFN-mediated immune responses (Canton et al., 2018; Shaw et al., 2005). Recently, pig KPNA4 has been demonstrated to bind pig IRF3 and initiate IFN-\u03b2 production during porcine circovirus infection (Li et al., 2018). However, the role of avian KPNA4, especially duck KPNA4 (duKPNA4), in type I IFN expression was unknown. The IRF3 gene is absent in ducks, and the functions of duck IRF7 (duIRF7) complement most of IRF3's functions in regulating type I IFN expression (Magor et al., 2013). Therefore, we sought to explore whether duKPNA4 interacts with duIRF7 and induces type I IFN expression.",

JEV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus of the flavivirus genus that is transmitted by mosquitoes and vertebrate-amplifying hosts including birds (Dhanda et al., 1977). JEV infection causes stunted growth and death in ducklings (Xiao et al., 2018). In addition, JEV NS5 protein interacts with human KPNA4 and inhibits the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB in human cells (Ye et al., 2017). We therefore cloned the duKPNA4 gene and analyzed its role in type I IFN expression as well as the antiviral response against JEV in primary duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs).",

In mammalian cells, KPNA4 interacts with IRF3 and subsequently promotes its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus triggering the expression of type I IFN (Li et al., 2018). The IRF3 gene is absent in the duck genome; therefore duIRF7 substitutes for most of IRF3's functions in regulating type I IFN expression (Chen et al., 2018). Given that duKPNA4 upregulated type I IFN expression, we investigated whether duKPNA4 might interact with duIRF7 and promote the translocation of duIRF7 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. DEFs were co-transfected with plasmids for expression of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc, and their co-localization was determined by IFAs in the presence or absence of poly(I:C) stimulation. The expressed duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc mainly co-localized in the cytoplasm in the absence of poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 5\nA). However, in response to poly(I:C) stimulation, both the expressed duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and co-localized in the nucleus (Fig. 5A), thus suggesting a possible interaction between duKPNA4 and duIRF7. To confirm this interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation in DEFs co-transfected with plasmids for expression of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc, by using anti-HA antibody for immunoprecipitation and anti-Myc antibody for detection of the immunoprecipitated proteins. The duKPNA4-HA co-immunoprecipitated with duIRF7-Myc (Fig. 5B), thus revealing that duKPNA4 interacted with duIRF7 in DEFs. To further analyze whether duKPNA4 promoted the nuclear translocation of duIRF7, we extracted the nuclear fractions from DEFs co-transfected with plasmids for expression of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc, in the presence of poly(I:C) stimulation, and performed western blotting analysis to detect the protein levels of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc. The expression of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc in the whole cell lysates (WCL) of DEFs was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 5C). Analysis of changes in the protein levels of duIRF7-Myc in the nuclear fractions revealed that the nuclear accumulation of duIRF7-Myc increased, an effect correlated with the increased nuclear accumulation of duKPNA4-HA (Fig. 5C and D), thus indicating that duKPNA4 facilitated the nuclear translocation of duIRF7, thereby upregulating type I IFN expression.",

DEFs were infected with JEV at different MOI (0.5, 1 and 5), and total RNA was extracted from JEV-infected cells to detect the endogenous mRNA expression levels of duKPNA4. The qRT-PCR analysis indicated that JEV infection did not significantly affect the mRNA expression of endogenous duKPNA4 in DEFs (Fig. 6\nA). However, the subcellular location of duKPNA4-HA shifted from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in DEFs in response to JEV infection (Fig. 6B), similarly to the translocation induced by poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 3). Analysis of type I IFN expression in JEV-infected DEFs with or without overexpression of duKPNA4-HA revealed that exogenous expression of duKPNA4-HA significantly elevated the mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 induced by JEV infection, as compared with the levels in JEV-infected DEFs without duKPNA4-HA expression (vector control) (Fig. 6C). The expression of duKPNA4-HA in JEV-infected DEFs was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 6D). Together, these data indicated that duKPNA4 resulted in nuclear translocation of duIRF7 and facilitated type I IFN expression during JEV infection, thereby implying its involvement in the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response.",

Knockdown of human KPNA4 in MCF-7 cells significantly inhibits NF-\u03baB activity and impairs IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression, thus leading to immunological dysfunction (Zhu et al., 2015), whereas up-regulation of KPNA4 enhances NF-\u03baB activation (Chen et al., 2016). Porcine KPNA4 has been found to be involved in the IRF3-mediated type I IFN signaling pathway during porcine circovirus type 2 infection (Li et al., 2018). In ducks, the toll-like receptor signaling pathway and the retinoic-acid-inducible gene I signaling pathway largely resemble the human pathways (Evseev and Magor, 2019) and play essential roles in the regulation of type I IFN expression and host antiviral response (Yu and Levine, 2011). Notably, IRF3, as a downstream molecule in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway and the retinoic-acid-inducible gene I signaling pathway, is absent in ducks, and duIRF7 instead performs most functions of IRF3 in inducing type I IFN expression (Santhakumar et al., 2017). In the current study, duKPNA4 interacted with duIRF7 and facilitated the nuclear translocation of duIRF7. Mechanistically, duKPNA4 promotes type I IFN expression, probably via the duIRF7-mediated type I IFN signaling pathway, in contrast to mammalian KPNA4.",

            "text": "Given the highly conserved amino acid sequence similarity and the conserved role in type I IFN expression, KPNA4 may be an important molecule in type I IFN signaling as well as type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, and may be targeted by viruses to antagonize the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response. Indeed, the 4b protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus binds KPNA4 and impairs the interaction between KPNA4 and the NF-\u03baB-p65 subunit, thus interfering with the host innate immune response (Canton et al., 2018). JEV NS5 protein competitively binds KPNA4 and inhibits the nuclear translocation of IFN transcription factors, thus suppressing IFN expression (Ye et al., 2017). These previous observations together with our results emphasize the importance of KPNA4 in the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response. However, these roles must be further mechanistically explored to gain more insight into the full biological functions of KPNA4.",

In response to JEV infection, duKPNA4 translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and elevated the expression of type I IFN expression. Exogenous expression of duKPNA4 significantly inhibited JEV replication. Together, these data suggested that duKPNA4 is involved in type I IFN expression as well as the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response.",
