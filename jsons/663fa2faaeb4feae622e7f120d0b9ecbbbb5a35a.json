We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus, organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus (WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in preclinical and clinical trial. Analogues of the specific compounds tested have already been studied clinically, implying they can be fast-tracked for public use. With the current COVID-19",

Its accumulation leads to Gaucher diseases accompanied by chronic brain inflammation and activation of the antiviral immune response (6) . GSLs are involved in lateral and vertical segregation of receptors required for attachment, membrane fusion and endocytosis, as well as in intracellular replication, assembly and release of viruses. In addition, GSLs and their metabolites are inseparably interwoven in signal transduction processes, and the regulation of innate and intrinsic responses of infected target cells (7) . Viral-induced elevation of SL levels was shown to be associated with a number of viruses; elevation of GM2-ganglioside and Lactosylceramide was shown upon infection with Zika virus and Hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively (8, 9) . Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) induces elevation of ceramide and GM2-ganglioside (10) , and Dengue virus induces elevation of ceramide and sphingomyelin (11) . Additionally, Influenza virus was shown to induce Sphingomyelin and GlcCer elevation (12, 13) and suppression of the biosynthesis of cellular sphingolipids results in the inhibition of the maturation of influenza virus particles in vitro (14, 15) . Moreover, iminosugars are known for their broad-spectrum antiviral activity, presumably because of their mechanism of action as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident \u03b1-glucosidases I and II inhibitors (16) . 1-Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) iminosugar derivatives inhibit in vitro production of infectious viruses including dengue virus (DENV) (17, 18) , hepatitis B virus (HBV) (19, 20) , hepatitis C virus (HCV) (21), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (22, 23) , and influenza A virus (24) .

In this context, NB-DNJ is used as an inhibitor of UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)), (EC 2.4.1.80) to reduce production of GSLs that accumulate due to a deficiency in GlcCer degradation (28) . Thus, GSL synthetic pathways may be therapeutic targets for a broad-range of viral infection. Drugs targeting SL metabolizing enzymes are currently in use and constantly being developed for treating LSDs and other disorders in which alteration in SL levels are involved in disease pathology ( 29 -31 ) . This allows a potential repurposing of these already approved drugs as antivirals. While the inhibitor NB-DNJ affects multiple host targets, specific inhibition of GCS is now possible using GCS inhibitors which are currently available. In this study, we examined the antiviral activity of two specific inhibitors of GCS, which catalyze the biosynthesis of GlcCer. These inhibitors block the conversion of ceramide to GlcCer, the first step in the biosynthesis of gangliosides and other glycosphingolipids. ",

The time-dependence of the inhibitory effect of the compound suggest that its anti-SVNI activity may be due to inhibition of early steps in the SVNI replication cycle. To further elaborate on the mechanism of GCS inhibition of SVNI life cycle, a Sindbis virus encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of the subgenomic promoter (SIN-GFP) (42) was used. In this virus, GFP translation is only triggered upon the assembly of viral replication complexes enabling transcription of the sub-genomic RNA and translation of the encoded genes, including GFP in this case. To ensure single-cycle infection, a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 was applied. Vero cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcM GZ-161 or GZ-346 one hour prior to infectionwith SIN-GFP and GFP signal was measured at intervals of 2 hours(Fig. 2B). While GFP expression was highly elevated in untreated cells, a robust reduction was observed in GZ-161 and GZ-346 treated cells compared to untreated cells(Fig. 2B). To determine if GFP-levels were reduced due to a decrease in the number of GFP-expressing cells or due to an overall impaired expression in all cells, flow cytometry analysis of single-cycle infection was used(Fig. 2C). GZ-161 or GZ-346 significantly reduced the number GFP-expressing cells 24 hpi from ~90% in untreated cell to ~60% and ~30% in GZ-161 and GZ-346 treated cell, respectively.

To further determine the efficacy of GCS inhibitors, cells were treated with serial dilutions of GZ-161 or GZ-346 and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Supernatants were collected for qPCR at 24 hpi. As was shown for Vero cells, no toxicity of GZ-161 and GZ-346 was observed at any of the concentrations tested.The IC50 of GZ-161 and GZ-346 treatments were determined at ~2 \u03bcM, under these conditions (Fig 6C). Next, the ability of GCS inhibitors to reduce the CPE of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in comparison to Remdesivir was examined. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2(51). Due to the current public health emergency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19(52). Vero E6 cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcM GZ-161, GZ-346, or Remdesivir, one hour prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and cell viability was measured at 48 hpi. Remarkably, Both GZ-161 and GZ-346 significantly reduced SARS-CoV2-induced CPE. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 reduced cell viability to 40% in the untreated cell, whereas treatment with GZ-161, GZ-346 and Remdesivir increased cell viability to 100%, 100% and ~75%, respectively(Fig. 6D).

            "text": "-161 and GZ-346 have a broad spectrum antiviral activity. They inhibit in vitro viral replication of 4 viruses (SVNI, WNV, Influenza and SARS-CoV-2) from 4 different genus with different routes of infection and target tissues. While in this work we examined the effect of GCS inhibitors against enveloped RNA viruses, their effect on DNA viruses and non-enveloped viruses remains to be elucidated.The mechanism by which GCS inhibitors block viral replication is not fully-resolved. GCS inhibitors inhibit SVNI replication in-vitro if administered pre infection, or immediately following it. They prevent GFP expression, which is only expressed after the generation of the replication complex and inhibit the virus also in single-cycle (high MOI) infection. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors interrupt with early stage of SVNI replication cycle. Sphingolipids play a significant role in endocytosis, thus might play a major role in virus penetration to the cell.Previous works showed that knocking out UGCG (the gene encoding for GCS) impaired the entry of Influenza virus by endocytosis(43). In addition to its role in endocytosis, the cellular membrane has a major role in establishing specialized membrane replication compartments (RCs) that are critical sites for the synthesis of the viral genome(44). WNV and DENV were shown to stimulate de novo lipid synthesis(45)(46)(47), while enteroviruses recruit host lipids important for their replication to the RCs by lipolysis(48). Whether GCS inhibitors inhibit SVNI cellular entry or the creation of the replication complex remains to be shown.Interestingly, elevation of host Glycosphingolipids, as occurring in the lysosomal storage diseases Gaucher and Krabbe, induces activation of type I interferon response(6). Together with our results showing a key role of GlcCer synthesis in the lifecycle of a broad range viruses, it may explain the evolving of antiviral response activation as a result of glycosphingolipids accumulation.",

Targeting host proteins or pathways utilized by multiple viruses is less prone to the development of resistance to the drug through mutations.

It is possible that such treatment can lower the required dosage targeting viral protein and lower the risk of viral resistance.Materials and MethodsCellsVero (ATCC\u00ae CCL-81\u2122), Vero E6 (ATCC\u00ae CRL-1586\u2122), Neuro-2a (ATCC\u00ae CCL-131\u2122) and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC\u00ae CCL-34\u2122) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Summit Pharmaceuticals International, Japan).
