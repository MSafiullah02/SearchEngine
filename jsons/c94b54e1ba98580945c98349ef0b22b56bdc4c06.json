At least, palliative care, in its broadest sense, should be guaranteed for everyone in need. Proactive, innovative approaches may be needed in order to provide widely available and easily accessible palliative care, as surge of palliative resources could also be anticipated. Here, as early experiences highlight, the use of novel and digital technologies may be of great help [9]. \uf0b7 Frontline caregivers should be thoroughly exculpated from imposed ethical dilemmas with considerable and irreversible consequences they are currently facing, as they are merely actors in a drama where most of ethical judgements and decisions have already been made. The responsibility of such decisions should not be transferred to moral agents that are on the front lines which moral agency and responsibility is profoundly undermined and every effort should be made to provide them instrumental and emotional support, also by using innovative and new approaches, such as digital technologies.",

Most of them advocate, at one level or another, certain relaxation of ethical standards and justification processes of different end-of-life related procedures (especially withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatments). In that sense, comprehensive guidelines on fair allocation of scarce medical resources have been proposed [1, 2, 7] . Customized intensive care unit admission triage protocols including integration of triage officers/committees and various priority scoring systems have also been highlighted [2, 6] . Previously well-established tools, such as advance care planning are being increasingly encouraged [1, 2, 5, 6] . Tools of informed assent, instead of informed consent, regarding the use of possible life-sustaining treatments has been reintroduced [5] . The main aims of such approaches are to limit the use of treatment options that are not only unwanted (either by patients or their close ones) or not beneficial, but also to allow just and fair (re)allocation of scarce health care resources. Additional commonly stated aim of such approaches and corresponding guidelines is to protect (preferably legally, ethically, psychologically and physically) frontline caregivers from making such a devastating finite decisions.",

As this dilemma is mostly resolved by the introduction of restrictive public health measures, the further issues that are emerging are primary matter of survival utilitarianism, especially in the setting where these measures were introduced to late. However, ethics and survival are rarely the same things. One could even argue that ethics is about exactly those issues that emerged after the humans managed to unbrace most of the worries related to bare existence/survival, so when humans reached the stage of development when they became the agents who can and do shape their future and future of their environment. The most one can expect from survival strategies is to be fair, consistent and preferably transparent. Ethics is about what should and/or ought to be done, while ought implies that something can be done, while recognizing that every voluntary and intentional act is inherently morally notable as it reflects agents' values. In ongoing pandemic setting, that is similarly tragically shaped by the infectious threat as well as by inevitable but untimely responses, ethics is fundamentally",
