When a patient is hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2, family and friends were not allowed to be with him or her, and the farewells were done as the patient got into the ambulance. The grieving process, however, implies three phases [2] : viewing of the body, performing a collective ceremony to support those affected, and finally accepting the person's death. The public health measures were difficult to accept, leading to an incapacity of families to grieve their loved ones.",

Following the usual washing and preparation of the body, several close relatives can now view the face of the body, but there is no obligation of quick inhumation or cremation. This latest measure is leading to the creation of temporary morgues (refrigerated trucks, ice rinks. . .) where bodies are awaiting treatment. They are in the public mind contemporary versions of medieval mass graves [2] . However, the recommendations between countries, apart from any religious considerations, very different, as is what is done on a daily basis. Thus, while some allow embalming [5] there are also mass burials which contributes to people's anxiety.",

Allowing friends and relative to view the deceased, without touching him/her, and in small groups by keeping a distance of one meter between people. No funeral wake with several people, if a body bag is to be used, and the family didn't get a chance to see the body before he/her was put in the coffin, a transparent bag can be used, place the body in a coffin within 24 h. Cremations or inhumations should then proceed within 3 days. Always respecting the distance of one meter between people, the closest relatives can attend the burial and it is preferable that people speak to relatives by mobile phone. It seems important to avoid the setting up of temporary morgues or mass graves which reinforce the trauma experienced by families and society.",
