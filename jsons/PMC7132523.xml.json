The American College of Chest Physicians defines acute cough illness, in contrast to chronic or persistent cough, as lasting less than 3 weeks.13 Acute upper respiratory tract infection accounted for approximately 70% of primary diagnoses in adults presenting for an ambulatory office visit with a chief symptom of cough.14 Asthma and pneumonia were the next most common diagnoses, assigned to 6% and 5% of patients, respectively. The predominance of cough and accompanying clinical features suggestive of an acute upper respiratory tract infection, such as sore throat or rhinorrhea, is usually used to distinguish bronchitis from other acute upper respiratory tract infections.1 As one might expect, clinicians are inconsistent in assigning each diagnosis.2 For example, some clinicians diagnose acute bronchitis only when productive cough is present; others insist on the presence of purulent sputum.",

However, in the setting of acute cough ( <2 to 3 weeks\u2019 duration), the diagnosis of asthma is difficult to establish because many patients with acute bronchitis will have transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness (and abnormal results on spirometry). No guidelines have been established for distinguishing transient from chronic bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and long-term follow-up studies suggest that abnormalities on pulmonary function testing in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis typically resolve after 2 to 3 weeks, although they may last as long as 2 months.15, 16, 17 The diagnosis of cough-variant asthma, in contrast, is generally reserved for patients with persistent cough ( >2 to 3 weeks\u2019 duration), lack of wheezing, and (usually) normal results on pulmonary function tests.18, 19 Cough-variant asthma should be suspected in adults with persistent cough that worsens at night or after exposure to cold or exercise; the diagnosis relies on improvement of symptoms with bronchodilator treatment or a positive result on a methacholine challenge test. Therefore, in the absence of severe airflow obstruction, it is prudent to limit evaluation for possible chronic asthma or cough-variant asthma to patients with cough illness lasting longer than 3 weeks.",

Four prospective studies (1984 to 1990) examined the accuracy of patient history and physical examination for diagnosing radiographic pneumonia in adults with acute respiratory illness in outpatient and emergency department settings, and a clinical decision tool to determine the need for radiography was developed.20, 21, 22, 23 A subsequent validation study done by an independent group of investigators found that the specificity (about 67%) but not the sensitivity (about 75%) of these prediction rules for detecting radiographic pneumonia exceeded that of physician judgment (specificity, 58%).24 An evidence- and quality-based review of these studies25 concluded that the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate \u2265100 beats/min, respiratory rate \u226524 breaths/min, or oral temperature \u226538\u00b0C) and chest examination (focal consolidation\u2014for example, rales, egophony, or fremitus) sufficiently reduces the likelihood of pneumonia to the point where further diagnostic testing is usually not necessary [A].

We excluded studies involving patients with chronic lung disease, malignant conditions, or immunosuppression, as well as those conducted during confirmed outbreaks of a pathogen (for example, a Chlamydia pneumoniae outbreak at a single university). We limited our selection to English-language studies of consecutive, unselected adolescents or adults enrolled in nonreferral, ambulatory settings.

Noninfectious causes of uncomplicated acute bronchitis, such as occult asthma exacerbation or toxic fume inhalation, should also be considered, although the prevalence of these conditions in adults with acute cough illness has not been well studied. In epidemiologic studies, respiratory viruses, particularly influenza, appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis according to culture, antibody serology, or polymerase chain reaction. Specific viruses most frequently associated with acute bronchitis include those that produce primarily lower respiratory tract disease (influenza B, influenza A, parainfluenza 3, and respiratory syncytial virus), as well as viruses that more commonly produce upper respiratory tract symptoms (corona virus, adenovirus, and rhinoviruses).

As a group, these agents are associated with 5% to 10% of all cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis in adults. They are recovered more frequently (10% to 20% of cases) in studies of adults with chronic or persistent cough.39, 40, 41 The diagnoses in these studies are frequently based on serologic conversion, an event that can also occur in asymptomatic persons and may not be related to the clinical illness in question. More recent studies using polymerase chain reaction have reported similar frequencies of recovery of these agents in adults with acute bronchitis. No evidence indicates that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae , or Moraxella catarrhalis produces acute bronchitis in adults without underlying lung disease. Studies reporting an association between these encapsulated bacteria and acute bronchitis have failed to distinguish between colonization and acute infection. Since Gram stain and culture of sputum do not reliably detect M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, or B. pertussis , these tests are not recommended in the evaluation of patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.",

Consistent with these conclusions, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration removed uncomplicated acute bronchitis (or \u201csecondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis\u201d) as an indication for randomized, controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy in 1998. Since then, three meta-analyses have also been published.53, 54, 55 These meta-analyses are plagued by lack of uniformity in outcome measures used in each of the randomized, placebo-controlled trials and by inclusion of poor-quality studies. In one of the meta-analyses,54 no statistically significant benefit of antibiotic treatment was observed when cough duration was treated as a continuous variable. However, when cough was treated as a dichotomous variable (proportion of patients with cough at a follow-up visit), the investigators reported a significant difference (relative risk, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.49 to 0.98]). Another meta-analysis55 transformed heterogenous outcome measures to calculate a \u201cstandardized effect size\u201d and reported that antibiotic therapy decreases the duration of cough and sputum by 0.5 day (over a 7-day period). The third meta-analysis53 excluded three trials that were included in the previous meta-analyses on the basis of poor quality45 or lack of information on loss to follow-up43, 46; those investigators reported no benefit of antibiotic treatment on cough duration. All three meta-analyses reported no impact of antibiotic treatment on duration of illness, limitation of activity, or loss of work, and all concluded that routine antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis in adults is not justified.",

Antimicrobial therapy for suspected pertussis in adults is recommended primarily to decrease shedding of the pathogen and spread of disease, since antibiotic treatment does not appear to hasten resolution of symptoms if it is initiated 7 to 10 days after onset of illness.57, 58, 59 Because of the public health implications of pertussis, antibiotic treatment of suspected pertussis should always be accompanied by a diagnostic test. Diagnostic tests for pertussis are not routinely available; one could inquire at local or state health departments or academic medical centers for further assistance.",

The relative proportion of cases due to each type of influenza varies substantially from year to year. In the 1999\u20132000 influenza season, 99% of influenza cases from surveillance facilities in the United States were due to influenza A. All drugs appear to have a similar impact on influenzal illness: about 1 less day of illness, and about a half-day quicker return to normal activities. On the basis of the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s calculations, adverse effects are modestly more frequent with rimantadine (in about 32% of patients; most cases are related to the central nervous system) than oral neuraminidase inhibitor (in about 24% of patients; most cases are gastrointestinal) or placebo (in about 19% of patients). Neuraminadase inhibitors are likely to be much more costly to health plans and patients than rimantadine, although formularies are likely to vary considerably.",

Accurate clinical diagnosis of influenza outside the annual outbreak period is more difficult. As a result, diagnostic testing for influenza outside outbreaks, when suspected, may be considered for epidemiologic purposes.",

Patients frequently expect to receive antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis5, 73; however, this expectation appears to derive from previous receipt of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis.5 Mounting evidence indicates that patient satisfaction with the office encounter for uncomplicated acute bronchitis does not depend on receipt of antibiotic therapy but instead is related to the patient-centered quality of the encounter (for example, believing that the provider spent enough time and explained the illness and treatment plan).73 A combined patient and physician educational intervention that reduced antibiotic use for acute bronchitis did not lead to greater utilization of services (such as nonantibiotic prescriptions or return visits),74 greater patient dissatisfaction, or longer duration of illness.75 A recommended outline for discussing the management of acute bronchitis with patients includes the following steps.1.Provide realistic expectations for the duration of the patient\u2019s cough, which will typically last 10 to 14 days after the office visit.2.Refer to the cough illness as a \u201cchest cold\u201d rather than bronchitis.5 In a study of members of a commercial managed care organization\u2019s health plan, use of the term \u201cchest cold\u201d was associated with much less frequent belief that antibiotic therapy was necessary to get better.3.Personalize the risk of unnecessary antibiotic use. Inform patients that previous antibiotic use increases their likelihood of carriage of and infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, that antibiotics commonly have side effects (gastrointestinal symptoms or alterations in taste, for example), and that rare but serious adverse reactions may occur, such as anaphylaxis.4.Explain to patients why we need to be more selective in treating only those conditions for which a major clinical benefit of antibiotics has been proven\u2014tell them that the current epidemic in antibiotic resistance among community bacterial pathogens is a major public health concern.\n",
