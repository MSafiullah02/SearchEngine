On February 11, 2020, this epidemic was officially named as COVID-19 and was acknowledged as an infectious disease resulting in public health emergency, as it quickly spread within China and to further 24 countries is situated geographically between 42.937084\u00b0 N and \u2212 75.6107\u00b0 E (Anderson et al., 2020). Clinical studies relating to COVID-19 reported that most patients suffer from difficulty in breathing and pneumonia (Holshue et al., 2020; Perlman, 2020). Symptoms reported in clinical treatments were similar to other coronavirus illnesses such as MERS and SARS e.g. cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing due to respiratory disorder, and in worst-case scenario COVID-19 causes kidney failure, pneumonia, and even death (Wang et al., 2020).",

(2013) support our findings. Shi et al. (2020) also researched climate indicators and stated that temperature serves as a driver for the COVID-19. As a cultural and financial capital of the world, New York city also oversees high mobility from local as well as constituents from other major places to seek employment and business opportunities. Humidity is another contributor for the spread of COVID-19 as it contributed in the rapid transmission within New York City and empirical estimations of this study will be useful in the outcome of efforts to suppress COVID-19. According to official census data, New York City is resident to 8.54 million people with population increasing at 4.6% per year and 26,403 residents living per square mile. The reason for such a dense population is the average life expectancy of New York residents, which is 80.9 years, this is 2.2 years longer than the national average of life expectancy in America. Such statistics make New York an ideal epicenter for the spread of infectious diseases (Zu et al., 2020).",
