            "text": "Health psychology is a relatively new field and international health psychology even newer. Anthropologists and cross-cultural psychologists have worked in Africa and Asia for many years, but I rarely find another health psychologist when I work in the poorest countries. With their skills they would have a great deal to offer. Health psychologists know not only about cultural differences but also about basic cognitive and social processes as they apply to health problems. They know how to use qualitative and quantitative methods to describe problems and evaluate solutions. Health psychologists generally are problem-focused: they study health problems where social\u2013psychological and behavioral processes are part of the problem. Health psychologists are also solution-focused. They are not satisfied with simply describing and measuring stress and its effect on health; they also want to evaluate ways to reduce stress. They study diet and exercise and ways to enhance these and other lifestyles through health promotion. International health psychologists use the same problem- and solution-focused approach in developing countries. Working with a local team of experts who have identified the pressing local health problems, they examine sources of the problem and ways to tackle it. The problems are different in developing countries, but the steps taken to solve them may not be. If you cannot use public service television advertising to tell people about the benefits of breast feeding and bed nets, you can nonetheless train community health workers or teachers to provide lively entertainment\u2013education on these topics to groups of people. Instead of tackling heart disease, stroke, and cancer, international health psychologists tackle diseases of children who die in large numbers or are left physically and mentally disabled by the age of 5. They also focus on women who are at greater risk than men of getting HIV, who die or are disabled as a result of giving birth, and who are the guardians of their family\u2019s health, yet have little decision-making power. Instead of working with hospitals where only a small minority of the population go for treatment, international health psychologists work with rural communities and village health workers to prevent death and disease.",

            "text": "Why might psychologists want and need to become informed about international perspectives on health? First, we have come to realize that we can learn from problems and solutions being evaluated in other countries. We can learn how people from different cultures think about causes of illness and find strikingly similar ways of thinking in our own country. We can learn how strategies to change health behavior have succeeded or failed in other countries, for example with respect to abstinence and condom use, and adjust our own strategies accordingly. We can broaden our theories, for example theories of stress and coping or theories of behavior change, on the basis of research in developing countries. Second, psychologists have an important role to play in improving the health of people in developing countries. As health psychologists with a population health perspective, we are welcomed by multi-disciplinary teams of researchers and health workers who attempt to resolve health problems through environmental, social, psychological, and medical changes. Prevention of illness is less expensive than cure, and psychologists are experts in preventive behaviors. Health workers, therefore, seek input from psychologists to help them promote a large array of good health behaviors. For example, hand-washing and home management of dehydration far exceed hospital or medical treatments of diarrhea. Behavior change in the use of treated mosquito bed nets are at the forefront of the fight against malaria, given that no vaccine is yet available. Abstinence and condom use are still the only ways to prevent HIV. Having a birth plan to give birth at a clinic rather than at home increases a woman\u2019s chance of surviving without disability \u2013 in many countries, delivering a baby is riskier than an abortion. Persuading mothers to breast feed their infants for 6 months and to serve animal source foods and vegetables to their young children are keys to overcoming the appalling levels of malnutrition. Psychologists may not study viruses and vaccines, but they know more than others about attitude and behavior change.",

            "text": "Furthermore, why might psychology students want to become informed about international perspectives on health? More and more young people are traveling out of curiosity about others and a desire for personal growth. They feel a sense of responsibility at least to be informed about the struggles of people who live in other countries. Some want to work abroad, after their degree, with Peace Corps or one of the many non-governmental organizations such as World Vision or Save the Children. Most are relatively na\u00efve about the challenges they will encounter, but they are eager and well-intentioned. Other students are critical of these adventurers and accuse them of being \u201cneocolonials\u201d and \u201ccultural universalists.\u201d My class always has a rousing debate on these two positions. Some students mistakenly think that American psychologists parachute themselves into remote places and start controlling people\u2019s health behaviors. The reality is that we are visiting experts who work alongside local people who want to change. Organizations are happy to have students, not because they have the skills to really make a difference, but because they are the international experts of the future. Their international perspective will help American donors set proper priorities for the fight against hunger, illiteracy, HIV, and malaria. They will understand that the usual strategies of funding hospitals and expensive equipment are not the best solutions. Students with a background in psychology will see first-hand that their skills in the area of environmental, social, and behavioral change are put to good use. As part of class preparation, students can be encouraged to Google organizations welcoming young volunteers and at the same time discover the common problems faced by people in places such as Africa and South Asia.",

Goals set by the international community toward which all international experts are now working, called the Millennium Development Goals, consist largely of improved health (compare with the US Healthy People Initiatives). Among the eight goals, to be reached by the year 2015, are reducing hunger, child deaths, women\u2019s deaths during delivery, and infectious diseases such as HIV and malaria. To accomplish these are goals that include clean sources of water, proper waste disposal, use of skilled birth attendants, use of condoms and other forms of contraception, and gender equality in education. Although some but not all of the goals will be met on time, by some but not all regions of the world, their ratification by all countries belonging to the United Nations provides an incentive to work cooperatively. Students can find online the site for the Millennium Development Goals and how much progress has been made in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America.",

Rather than describe exotic cross-cultural examples of how a remote tribe in Africa conducts trepanation to reduce pain or a how Western surgeons fly to Asia to perform cataract surgery, small examples that add one unusual twist to an otherwise smooth-flowing lecture, I have selected three Millennium Development Goals.\nReducing the number of women who die delivering. Why is it riskier to deliver than to abort? Why do young women find it difficult to live healthy lives? This is one of the most popular topics among my students because they note striking contrasts with their own life, yet they strongly identify with the issues.Environmental health including sources of clean water, waste disposal, and personal hygiene. Water shortage is a worldwide obsession and a looming problem for the USA. Why is water in developing countries unclean, and what are the consequences for health? This is a story of health behavior change in particular as it relates to waste disposal, hand-washing and face-washing at the family level. It extends to the use of mosquito nets and condoms. Psychologists are famous for their theories of behavior change but most theories have not worked well in developing countries. Why not? There is ample scholarly space for insightful and creative students to answer this question.Eliminating child hunger and its disabling effects on physical growth and cognitive development. While nine to ten million children under 5 years die each year from preventable causes, another 200 million are unable to reach their psychological potential because they lack food and stimulation. As psychologists, we grasp the tragedy of such waste. One-third of children in developing countries are short for their age, meaning they have suffered long-term hunger. A similar proportion of American children are overweight. Two lectures, back to back, on obesity and hunger provide an instructive contrast.\n",

These include HIV and AIDS, particularly in South Africa where school programs imported from the USA and modified for the African context have been evaluated (Gallant and Maticka-Tyndale 2004). New programs to promote condom use in the community are currently being created and evaluated (Jewkes et al. 2006, 2008). It is also connected there with alcohol abuse, intimate partner violence, and coercive sex. Patient\u2013Practitioner interactions and quality of care can also be studied in developing country settings. Shared decision making, privacy, and adherence are dilemmas in family planning clinics, health posts, and hospitals (Abdel-Tawab and Roter 2002; Hadley and Roques 2007). Health psychology students would enjoy arguing about the social, cultural, and ethical issues involved. Even where shared decision making and privacy are not cultural norms, women may still want both. Finally, alcohol and tobacco abuse are increasing in developing countries. In the USA, health education in schools target youth and environmental restrictions regulate where and to whom these items can be sold. Health psychology students might consider whether these strategies would be successful in Papua New Guinea, India, or China.",

My students get the latest.pdf copies of the tables at the back of the UNICEF document called The State of the World\u2019s Children. There are statistics on the proportion of children who die before their fifth birthday. This is the most telling indicator of a nation\u2019s overall health: If you cannot keep your children alive, then those who survive must also be doing poorly and their mothers must be in poor physical and mental health as well. There are also figures on how long people can expect to live, maternal mortality, malnutrition, literacy, HIV prevalence among young people, condom use, immunization, how much donor money goes into the country (called Official Development Assistance or ODA), and funds spent on health. This and more information is available about each country, about regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, and about groupings of countries such as the 50 least developed countries and 39 industrialized countries. You can also see how each indicator is defined and its source of data. One instructive group assignment for students is to give them a list of indicators, then let them pick a country in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America for which they find the indicator data. In the end, the instructor creates a composite table in full view of all, fielding figures from the three groups and inserting them into the table. The three columns of figures for, say, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Nicaragua may be compared with each other and with a fourth column of figures for the USA. Students can then decide which countries need the most work and in what areas of health.",

Maternal mortality is a health event with the greatest disparity between developing and industrialized countries: in the USA, only 1 of 4,800 women will die during her reproductive years, and at the time of delivery only 11 of 100,000 will die from complications.

So we go door-to-door, using what is called \u201cthe sisterhood method\u201d along with a verbal autopsy. We interview women between 15 and 49 years and ask about their adult sisters\u2019 survival. For those sisters who died, time of death along with details of the circumstances and symptoms prior to death is recorded. If the death occurred during pregnancy, delivery or up to 42 days after delivery, from causes related to or aggravated by the pregnancy, it is a case of maternal mortality. Obviously, a much more reliable method is possible when health researchers set up a demographic surveillance site as they did in Matlab, Bangladesh in the 1960s. Each year they visit households, asking about births, pregnancies, deaths, health, and illness. The following year, outcomes of the pregnancy will be recorded. If the mother has died, the child commonly dies shortly thereafter because a child cannot survive for long without a mother\u2019s care and breast milk.",

The first set of causes include early marriage; parents arrange for their daughters to get married in their late teens perhaps to avoid her getting pregnant out of wedlock or to have one less person to feed. Usually, they arrange an early marriage simply because everyone else in the village does and questions will be asked if a girl of 20 is still not married. Young brides and their families want children immediately because motherhood is a girl\u2019s primary role and confers status. Young bodies, especially bodies that are short due to malnutrition, do not have a fully developed birth canal; the fetus is likely to be either too large for the birth canal or low birth-weight. Young girls who live in an area across mid-Africa have likely undergone a procedure called genital cutting which produces inflexible scar tissue; this further impedes smooth passage of the fetus leading to the rupture of the birth canal. If the woman is young and lacks primary school education, she may be unaware of these risks. She has simply followed the wishes of her family and the practices of her community. If she has not completed fifth grade, she is not sufficiently literate to read about alternative available practices. Health psychologists study the cultural, social, and behavioral practices that prepare girls for safe motherhood.",

Part of the preparation entails prenatal visits to an obstetrician to check on the mother\u2019s weight gain and blood pressure and to check on the fetus\u2019 vital signs. In the least developed countries, particularly those in Africa and South Asia, only 60% seek prenatal (known as antenatal) care. The others claim that because they did not experience a problem, they did not need to go. The purpose of antenatal care, however, is prevention. For example, if it looks like the baby is too large for the mother\u2019s pelvic gap, a cesarean section may be planned. To prevent malaria during pregnancy, she may be given anti-malarial pills; if she is anemic (and most are), she may be given iron and folic acid supplements. Many of these services are provided free of charge by government clinics. So health psychologists may try to create pictorial leaflets with messages that motivate pregnant women, without scaring them, to seek antenatal care. Our involvement with screening programs for cancer gives us a sense of how difficult it is to motivate women who fear bad news.",

But delivery practices are difficult to change. Most mothers (over 60%) in the least developed countries deliver at home with the help of a traditional birth attendant or female relative, who perform deliveries on a regular basis but know little about cleanliness and less about what to do when the mother starts to bleed. She has no medicines to stop the pain or the bleeding. The family is left on their own to cope with the crisis.",

Another preventable cause of deaths is obstructed labor due to a small birth passage, to scar tissue from genital cutting, or to awkward positioning of the fetus. Antenatal care would have alerted the mother of potential problems associated with these conditions, perhaps to prepare for a cesarean section delivery.",

Furthermore, health education, along with pictures, warns women of conditions that are life-threatening, for which she should seek emergency obstetric care.

Women often continue to have children simply because they live in a culture that encourages having many children and they assume that their husbands want more children. Almost half of pregnancies (40%) globally are unwanted, meaning that the woman was not wanting or trying to get pregnant. Often she is too young or unmarried, perhaps pregnant through rape, or already has more children than she can care for. Some 22% of pregnancies result in induced abortion: safe abortions have little risk, but unsafe abortions often end in death and account for one-third of maternal deaths. Thus, two common strategies for reducing maternal deaths are contraception and safe abortion.",

Education importantly increases the chances that both husband and wife will want to use contraception.

Yet in places where responsibility to and for your extended family is strong, neither marriage partner nor family size is solely an individual choice. Students tend to think that lifestyle and other health behaviors are under personal control. Yet there are many examples where governments, for the protection of all, have regulated safety. Most of us must wear seat belts while driving in a vehicle. When seat belts were encouraged but voluntary, most people did not wear them and so killed or maimed themselves and their children unnecessarily. Once laws were passed requiring seat belt use, almost everyone buckled up and subsequently their attitudes changed in favor of seat belts. This is a good example of how governments can regulate health behaviors for the good of all, and let supportive attitudes follow in their wake. Another example is smoking: governments regulate the age when one can purchase cigarettes and places where you cannot smoke \u2013 the latter being an example of social responsibility. The age of alcohol purchase was raised in the USA as a result of alcohol abuse and drunk driving by high school and college students. The people of China and India have social norms about limiting one\u2019s family size; in many African countries, the norm is to have many children.

            "text": "A new and interesting research topic concerns HIV, pregnancy, and transmission to the newborn. Women between the ages of 18 and 24 are more than twice as likely as young men to become HIV-positive. Pregnancy increases her chances of becoming HIV-positive as does having an older male partner or husband (who had premarital or extramarital sexual experience). So for a number of biological and social reasons, pregnant women have additional risks due to potential HIV infection. A newborn child has a 35% chance of becoming infected, mostly during delivery and partly from breast milk. This is known as vertical transmission of HIV. Drugs given to mothers at the time of delivery prevent vertical transmission. However, expectant mothers need to first find out whether or not they are HIV-positive. They need to go to a clinic that provides voluntary counseling and testing (known as VCT). Antenatal clinics in high HIV countries now offer this service as standard care. So, persuading pregnant women to attend an antenatal clinic is the first step. Then convincing her to accept testing is the second step. On average about 70% do accept, with a range of 33\u2013100%. The reasons why they are reluctant to get tested include cost (though the cost is usually subsidized by the organization or government running it), fear of emotional trauma, fear of losing her husband or partner, and fear of social stigma. The fear factor may explain why some women agree to get tested but do not return for the test results, and why so few notify their partners of their status. Women who deliver at home have an extra responsibility to take the medication themselves at the right time. Health psychologists may have a special role to play evaluating women\u2019s fears and training counselors to be client-focused and sensitive. Thailand and Uganda have the best records for tackling their HIV problems through open dialog and easy access to services. We might learn from them something to apply at home and elsewhere (see Glick 2005, for more details).",

The former requires a change in health behavior and the latter requires technical skill and materials. Ethiopia has one of the lowest percentages of people using safe water and latrines: only 22% drink safe water and 13% use latrines. When we lived in Ethiopia, we boiled our water before drinking but of course no one else did. Most rural people defecated on the ground either in the bushes or around their home.

Still, people like to explain their misfortunes, so a number of interesting causal attributions get passed down the generations: Diarrhea comes from the eruption of baby teeth; hepatitis if you urinate at night facing the moon; malaria from morning mists; a cough and cold from cold weather. More serious illnesses come from the evil eye of a person or supernatural spirits that inhabit streams, animals, and trees. These are regarded as traditional beliefs, but their similarity around the world suggests that they arise not from a particular culture but from a universal need to understand uncontrolled causes of ill health. Beliefs may arise from noticed correlations. For example, baby teeth tend to erupt at an age when children start crawling, and crawlers pick up contaminated soil on their fingers and then suck them. Likewise, malaria comes from mosquitoes which propagate on stagnant waters, from which mist coincidently arises in the early morning. We all have health beliefs. It is difficult to break the transmission of such beliefs, as we know from the \u201ccold\u201d belief and from other false HIV beliefs.

            "text": "What are the microbes and what health behaviors are needed to prevent their disabling effects? The most common is rotavirus, causing diarrhea; also Escherichia coli bacteria and cholera. There are the common cold viruses which may lead to pneumonia and other more serious respiratory illnesses. Anemia is largely caused by hookworms, which thrive in contaminated soil. Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito. Trachoma, an eye infection, is caused by a bacteria carried by flies. We still have viral diarrhea and the common cold and cough in the USA, but no one dies from them except perhaps the frail elderly. We used to have malaria and trachoma but we succeeded in quarantining patients and controlling the mosquitoes and flies that carry them. However, infections such as these cause death, malnutrition and debilitating illness in Africa and Asia. Over six million children each year die from diarrhea and pneumonia; many more are left weak and malnourished from repeated bouts of these illnesses. Millions suffer from recurring episodes of malaria and are unable to work while the fever rages; but pregnant women and children are most likely to die especially from a cerebral form of malaria or anemia. Trachoma is active in 84 million people and is already responsible for blindness in 1.3 million people. Primary prevention of diarrhea, respiratory illness, and trachoma can be largely accomplished if everyone used a latrine and washed their hands and face, known as sanitation and personal hygiene. Prevention of malaria requires the use of insecticide-treated nets at home (Lindblade et al 2004). These are health behaviors that stop infections from being transmitted from one person to another or from an insect to a person. (As an aside, secondary prevention is the second line of action once the person has the illness and needs to prevent adverse consequences: Prevention of death from diarrhea, which is due to dehydration, requires oral rehydration sachets and zinc to replenish lost water and nutrients; unfortunately uninformed mothers withhold food and fluid in the hopes of stopping water loss. Prevention of death from pneumonia requires recognition of the signs in a young child and obtaining antibiotics from a health clinic. Antibiotic creams are also used to prevent blindness from untreated trachoma. Secondary prevention is costly; it is also ineffective in the long-term because a month or year later the microbes are back). Sanitation, personal hygiene and using bed nets are, therefore, the new health behaviors people need to adopt to prevent the misery of these illnesses.",

We decided to increase hand-washing at two key points \u2013 after defecation and before eating \u2013 by posting visual reminder cues at these two locations.

Curtis and Cairncross (2003) have reviewed this extensive literature which is now very relevant to North Americans. Women are generally better at this than men but we all need notices posted in critical places to remind us.

Flies carrying trachoma seek the moisture in children\u2019s eyes, so eyelids need to be washed regularly. Tanzania is a water-poor country so the goal of a long-standing project was not only to promote washing children\u2019s faces but also helping families overcome the water shortage which they said stood in the way of daily hygiene (Lynch et al. 1994; McCauley et al. 1990). The social norm implicitly understood by everyone was that precious water and time would be wasted on a child\u2019s face. No woman wanted to be criticized for being wasteful. Furthermore, her action might be interpreted as vanity, provoking the evil eye from an envious neighbor. The researchers, therefore, tried to build a community consensus by demonstrating that 30 people could wash their faces with water from a small gourd. Peer educators from the village visited individual families to help them identify reusable water for face-washing (clean water is not necessary) and a convenient time and to reward improvements. In the end, one village received eye ointment only and their levels of trachoma initially dropped but rose again 1 year later. Two villages with the behavior change strategy had more clean faces and less trachoma, but still not enough to eliminate trachoma entirely. A fourth village with the behavior change strategy showed no change at all: some women persisted in shaming mothers who washed their children\u2019s faces so the stubborn social norm proved to be an obstacle. Recent studies find that mass antibiotic treatment for whole villages succeed in reducing trachoma but not in eliminating it. Consequently without face-washing, a resurgence follows.",

Building latrines may go part way toward solving the problem; any family with a shovel and some local material can build themselves a latrine. But latrines have to be used; some villages and schools like to keep their donor-supplied latrines spotless and unused. One latrine promotion program was tried in rural Ethiopia, where only 7% of the people use latrines. Community leaders and health workers constructed demonstration latrines for families to view and copy (O\u2019Loughlin et al. 2006). Within 6 months, 50% of households had built and 45% used their latrine. Social pressure is usually applied when the community gets involved. In Bangladesh, community groups made a map of where every family defecated and this was discussed by the community at-large, who then made a decision to ban open defecation in their village (Kar 2005). People who could not find the intrinsic motivation to comply presumably found the extrinsic motivation after being subjected to shame. The combination of latrines, social pressure, and accompanying information seems to have led to change in most of these studies. Knowledge and attitudes by themselves work too slowly and are infrequently translated into behavior. Instead, one might conclude that it is sometimes more effective to change the behavior of a critical mass of people whose behavior then sets a new social norm.",

Two years later the Kenyan government distributed free nets to all children less than 5 years. Without going through a complicated explanation of why children more than adults needed the nets, distributors realized that giving the nets to children ensured that they were seen as child protection.

Simply providing knowledge to African students is insufficient according to a review of these studies (Gallant and Maticka-Tyndale 2004). For example, Bonita Stanton et al. (1998) found that abstinence was sustained for girls; for boys neither abstinence nor condom use was sustained. William R. Brieger et al. (2001) found that peer educators who met youth in bars to promote condom use convinced school-going youth to use condoms, but did not manage to convert out-of-school youth. For the former, behavior change preceded and exceeded attitude and knowledge change. Because HIV infections are increasing most rapidly among youth aged 15\u201324, and because the development of Africa depends on its youth, social scientists are looking for behavior change strategies with hard evidence for their effectiveness (Jewkes et al. 2006, 2008).",

In fact, in some countries such as India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Niger, and Zambia, 50% of children are stunted. Stunting, or being short for your age, is now known to be the central indicator of long-term malnutrition. Although famine and hunger grab headlines, chronically under-fed children go unrecognized by journalists and even by their mothers. Their mothers think they look about right for their age, whereas we might simply underestimate their age and think they look a few years younger than they are. Many of these children were born low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) because they did not receive sufficient nutrients in utero. Many continued to receive insufficient breast milk, if their mothers did not exclusively breast feed for 6 months. However, the major source of malnutrition is insufficient and low-quality food after 6 months of age, especially between 6 and 24 months when children need energy foods and micronutrients such as zinc and vitamin A (Black et al. 2008). Bouts of diarrhea and respiratory illness leave young children further weakened because foods were withheld during illness or not added during recovery. Malnutrition is, therefore, a problem that requires coordinated research by psychologists, nutritionists, and agricultural experts (WHO, 2003).",

Children whose signals are answered learn to continue this kind of mutual communication which eventually becomes shared conversation. Children whose signals are not answered stop signaling but remain distressed. Although responsive stimulation and responsive language has been studied extensively in the USA, the American size does not fit all. Akhtar and Gernsbacher (2008) argue convincingly that the distal form of communication studied in middle class families, namely looking (\u201cgaze\u201d) is uncommon in developing countries and even in the USA. This is because tactile stimulation is more common. Likewise others have shown that the American context in which responsive stimulation and language is studied, namely mother\u2013child play, rarely occurs in developing countries (Vandermaas-Peeler 2002). Play is seen as a child activity; adults are unlikely to play with child toys or is this necessary. So we need to select other contexts to study. One of these is reading or looking at pictures. The concept of dialogic reading, namely having a dyadic conversation about the story book, has been successfully exported from the USA and adapted to other countries. Even if mothers are illiterate, they may talk in a responsive manner with their child about pictures. It even works well when adapted to the preschool setting where the teacher can generate a responsive discussion with a group of children as he/she reads the story.",

It is not that the child\u2019s body tells it exactly what to eat and how much, but good eating habits should start early and require mother\u2013child coordination. In some countries, mothers are highly controlling and insist on feeding quickly and forcefully without consideration of the child\u2019s slower pace and desire to self-feed. These mothers may encounter frequent refusals despite the malnourished state of the child (e.g., Aboud et al. 2008). In other countries, mothers are uninvolved and let children fend for themselves, or are permissive and give children whatever they demand. None of these styles is responsive.

School feeding was common in the USA during the 1930s depression and is still common in poor districts. It is now sponsored by the World Food Program in developing countries where some 18 million children receive a daily meal at school (http://www.wpf.org/food_aid/school_feeding). Education researchers examine whether it increases enrolment and attendance \u2013 it does. Nutritionists study the kinds of foods that will improve weight and height. Psychologists question whether students\u2019 benefit in terms of school achievement as well as broader social and cognitive skills. Studies in Jamaica, South Africa, and Kenya along with many others have now been conducted. In a nutshell, they tell us that animal source foods, such as meat or fish, have a stronger impact than a vegetable-based meal, and the impact is greatest on arithmetic and nonverbal analytic reasoning skills (Neumann et al. 2007). Meat also results in students who are more active, take leadership roles, and initiate peer interactions. Furthermore, the impact on mental outcomes is greatest for younger children in the early school years. Finally, in line with the theme of this section, the impact is greater if food is combined with a stimulating educational program.",

            "text": "This final section brings us full circle. Education is known to be important along with the nutrition necessary for young brains to process information and learn. However, nutrition must start early at birth to prepare the child\u2019s physical, mental, and social health. Nutrition is cumulative in that the body cannot fully catch up if given food at 5 years but not earlier. However, the effects of responsive feeding behavior and food on children\u2019s long-term development are still being explored. More needs to be done to examine how nutrition and stimulation combine to promote all aspects of health \u2013 physical, mental, and social \u2013 in the preschool and school years. Nutrition and education are also important for maternal health. But future research here needs to examine how to change delivery practices and their effects on mothers\u2019 and newborns\u2019 survival. Similarly, ongoing research is examining ways to change other health behaviors and sustain these behaviors. In particular, behaviors that prevent debilitating diseases are at the forefront of international research. American researchers from many disciplines are contributing to these exciting new developments, bringing ideas from the USA to developing countries and returning with strategies to improve our own lives.",
