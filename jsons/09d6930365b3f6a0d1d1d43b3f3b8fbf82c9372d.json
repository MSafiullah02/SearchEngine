Here, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in 73 specimens from outdoor environment of three hospitals in Wuhan. We found SARS-CoV-2 in soils (205-550 copies/g), wastewaters (255 to 1.9\u00d710 4 copies/L) and aerosols (285-1130 copies/m 3 ) in locations close to departments receiving COVID-19 patients or in wastewater treatment sectors, which revealed significant viral spill-over in hospital outdoor environment that was possibly via respiratory droplets from patients or airborne aerosols from wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in other areas or on surfaces with regular disinfection. Soils eventually behave as viral receptors through deposition and potentially a secondary source spreading SARS-CoV-2 for a prolonged time. Our findings map the high-risk areas in hospital outdoor environment possessing spread risks of SARS-CoV-2, which require particular attention and complete sanitation for preventing SARS-CoV-2 outdoor transmission.",

Accordingly, many studies have addressed SARS-CoV-2 in hospital indoor environment to understand its transmission dynamics and find solutions protecting medical staffs or drop-in visitors 3, 15 . For healthy people and communities, there is still no knowledge about its presence in outdoor environment. It is of great urgency to evaluate the potential spill-over into open space and distribution in outdoor environmental matrices of SARS-CoV-2, that potentially survives for a prolonged time and threatens public health.",

As aerosol is dynamic, SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol depends on the occurrence of raspatory droplets or airborne viruses in short period, and the visits of COVID-19 confirmed or asymptomatic patients might contribute to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these areas 2 .

            "text": ". As these areas are not visited by COVID-19 patients and medical staffs, SARS-CoV-2 hypothetically comes from viral RNA-containing medical wastewater via the aerosolization in the uplifting process, forms airborne SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols, and eventually deposits on soils. The wastewater treatment sector in Wuchang FangcangHospital is a temporary closed system effectively preventing the spill-over of airborne SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater, and negative results were therefore obtained in surrounding aerosols and soils. As for other surfaces of road and wall in wastewater treatment sector, frequent disinfection of three times a day could effectively remove all virial RNA and resulted in non-detected SARS-CoV-2(Table 1).From our results in the three specialized hospitals dedicated for COVID-19 treatments, we for the first time proved the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in hospital outdoor environment. SARS-CoV-2 existed in all environmental matrices at hospital departments receiving confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (aerosols and soils) and wastewater treatment sector (wastewaters, aerosols and soils). These are high-risk areas for potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission in open environment. We therefore propose a schematic transport of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital outdoor environment (Figure 2). High-treatment sector might spread airborne viruses through uplifting or aeration and deposit SARS-CoV-2 on surrounding soils and solid-surfaces. Similar results have been observed for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus in air, medical devices and other swabbing environmental surfaces 21,22 and Norovirus in hospital indoor environment 23 . Traditional disinfection strategies focus on surfaces of walls, roads and facilities, and can deactivate with high efficiency, supported by negative RT-qPCR results of all surface samples in this work and data from other reports 24,25 . Viral presence and survival in soils are seldom discussed and there is limited work addressing the potential risks of soil viruses 26 . Soils are receptors of viruses from aerosols and waters, and potentially become a secondary source for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in outdoor environment.",

All samples were immediately placed in 4 \u00b0C ice-boxes and transferred into laboratory for RNA extraction on the same day.RNA extraction and RT-qPCRRNA extraction from all environmental specimens followed our reported protocol 20 . Briefly, water (400 mL) and aerosol (2-3 mL) samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant was subsequently supplemented with NaCl (0.3 mol/L) and PEG-6000 (10%), settled overnight at 4 \u00b0C, and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 minutes. Soil(3-5 g) and viral pellets after PEG-6000 sedimentation was extracted using the RNeasy\u00ae PowerSoil\u00ae Total RNA Kit (MOBIO, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR using AgPath-ID\u2122 One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies, USA) on a LightCycler 480 Real-time PCR platform (Roche, USA) in duplicates. Two target genes simultaneously amplified were open reading frame lab (CCDC-ORF1, -FAM-TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'). RT-qPCR amplification for template RNA. Reverse transcription was conducted at 45 \u00b0C for 10 min (1 cycle), followed by initial denaturation at 90 \u00b0C for 10 min (1 cycle) and 40 thermal cycles of 60 \u00b0C for 45 second and 90 \u00b0C for 15 seconds. Quantitative fluorescent signal for each sample was normalized by ROX\u2122 passive reference dye provided in 2\u00d7RT-PCR buffer. For each RT-qPCR run, both positive and negative controls were included. The copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from a standard calibration curve by a 10-fold serial dilution of genes encoding nucleocapsid protein with an amplification efficiency of 102.6%, calculated as copies=10 [-(Cq-39.086)/3.262] (R 2 =0.991). For quality control, a reagent blank and extraction blank were included for RNA extraction procedure and no contamination was observed. Author Contribution Concept and design: DZ, GL, YL, JQ.
