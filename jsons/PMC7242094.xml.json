Many countries had developed competencies in real-time surveillance and immunization, but overall, there was a pressing need for improving the resilience of the health sector in order to ensure effective outbreak response [2]. In response to recommendations from the JEEs, countries were supported to develop multisectoral National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS), addressing the gaps identified by the JEE and aligning with the various country sectoral plans.",

In our recent paper [3], we observed that Africa is better prepared than ever before because of our stronger national public health institutes, the rapid scale-up of testing capacity, better coordination at the continental level, and the capacity of built-in surveillance and contact tracing which has occurred since the 2013\u20132016 West African Ebola outbreak.",
