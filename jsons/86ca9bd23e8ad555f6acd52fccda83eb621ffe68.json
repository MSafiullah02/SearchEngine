To ensure high quality of the trial intervention as well as of patient care, we have developed a multilingual web-based training program to train relevant staff and test their competence. As we enter an under-explored area of e-learning, we have conducted a pilot study on the first of the five modules comprising the web-based training program to test the feasibility of developing such a program for an international trial with limited resources.",

Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international standard for designing, conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials involving human subjects, with the purpose of ensuring the safety and wellbeing of trial subjects as well as high scientific quality [3] . A core principle in GCP is that staff members involved in the trial \"should be qualified by education, training and experience to perform his or her respective task(s)\" [3] . One way to ensure this is by training the clinical staff [4] . Despite evidence suggesting that training staff members in trial-related tasks has a positive effect on the trial's results [5] , the training process is rarely reported [6] . Furthermore, recommendations for specific training requirements for clinical trials are not defined in the standards on GCP by the International Committee on Harmonisation.",

If you are not, learning will often happen through supervision by more experienced colleagues familiar with the interventions. However, when an intervention trial is rolled out in a clinical department, only a few staff members may be familiar with the intervention. Thus, training in trial-related procedures is necessary, not only for the safety of trial participants but also to give a relevant and practical estimate on the effect of the intervention in routine practice. This is done through a pragmatic trial such as SafeBooSC-III, where the purpose is to test the effect of a given intervention in a real-world setting [20] , i.e. what effect can be expected by implementing a specific intervention in a broad patient group, in a large number of departments. Therefore, in order to estimate the potential effect of implementing an intervention in routine practice, staff on-site should be trained in the intervention before the trial takes off [3, 20] . However, if the trial ought to reflect how the intervention works in a real-world scenario, the level and intensity of staff training should reflect this, meaning that you do not want to train your staff members to an expert level prior to trial initiation since this does not reflect a 'real-world' scenario and you will not thus get generalizable trial results. To provide a practically realistic level of introduction and training for the SafeBoosC-III trial, we have developed a multilingual online training program to train relevant staff and test their competence.",

All modules are designed as integrated training and certification modules, with each module consisting of a) learning material and b) a quiz. With the exception of the introduction module, all modules are built over a simplified adaptive framework, meaning that you are led directly to the quiz and will only be prompted to visit the learning materials if your answers to questions are wrong. If you answer all questions correctly, you have shown mastery of the subject matter and will be certified directly. As such the quiz is designed to recognize prior learning, as correct answers will get participants through the modules faster. For less experienced users, the option is given for the user to bypass the quiz and go directly to the learning materials first (Fig. 1) .",

Based on the narrative, a number of learning objectives were developed, all clearly described according to Bloom's Taxonomy's cognitive domain [21] to specify which degree of mastery the user should show. The narrative was also used to write the learning material for each module. Next, two to four questions related to each learning objective were developed, thereby representing a pool of questions used to build the quiz. The questions strive to be as relevant as possible and were therefore formulated in a case-like manner, with a short description of a clinical situation given for each question, followed by a varying number of response options. Cases reflect clinical situations that could happen during the conduct of SafeBoosC-III. Often, there are several correct response options constituting the format of multiple-choice questions with several-of-many answers. To pass a question, all the correct answers and only correct answers must be ticked (Fig. 2a) . Participants complete a module when they have answered one question per learning objective correctly. We could have chosen to require two (or three) correct answers per learning objective, but this would have inflated the volume of questions-and hence the costs-as well as the time to be used by participants. They will be exposed to new questions or re-exposed to questions they have already met from the quiz-pool on a continuous basis until the above criterion is met. Questions in the learning objectives that at any given time are not yet passed are presented in random order. This is done to reduce the risk that participants adopt a fast game, like a 'trial and error' strategy, rather than learning and understanding.",

Furthermore, we invited participants both with-and without previous experience on NIRS monitoring to participate. This was done to evaluate whether previous experience affected performance and comprehension. In SafeBoosC-III, the level of NIRS experience will vary between departments; thus, knowledge on feasibility of the certification and training program dependent on previous experience level is important. By using both closed-and open-ended questions, we were able to gain a wider and deeper understanding of the participants' experience, which revealed important strengths and limitations of our design.",

Due to limited resources, we were not able to assess the quality and precision of the translations from English to Spanish and Chinese and were therefore not able to determine whether the quality and precision of the translations affected the difference in performance parameters and satisfaction rates. Despite a reasonable participation rate with 81 of 100 participants completing the online survey, we do not know for certain if all 81 responders completed the module. When looking at performance data (time to completion and number of questions to completion), 77 of the 81 responders had entered data for at least one of these parameters. However, two of the 77 responders commented that they did not complete the module, despite entering data on performance. Thus, we do not find data entry on performance parameters reliable as a measure of module completion. If we ought to rely on comments from responders, a total of five commented that they did not complete the module, primarily due to technical issues. Furthermore, we do not know whether the 19 participants who did not answer the survey still entered the training module but, due to unknown reasons, refrained from participating in the survey. Theoretically, it is possible that some of the 19 participants have been training in the module but gave up before completion and therefore did not answer the survey. Due to restricted time, it was not possible for us to host the piloting in Moodle, which would have made it possible to track completion rates.",

Regarding 'time to completion', six responders reported that they spent 420 min in the module, but only between 20 and 8 questions. They were all from the same country. The module automatically tracks time spent in the module, and when you reach completion, it will report the total time until completion. We suspect, therefore, that the six responders have had the module open throughout a 7-hour period but only trained part of the time. The remaining 75 responders spent 60 min or less.",

Since we could not monitor training on-site, we do not know whether responders trained in groups instead of individually, or how much they supported each other in completing the module. This could potentially affect performance data as well as answers to the questionnaire, thereby decreasing the validity of our results. However, using the Safe-BoosC web-based training and certification program for group training instead of individual training may also be the case outside this pilot study; thus, this might depict how training and certification will be conducted when it is implemented externally. The module is structured and built for individual training, but group training may encourage discussions regarding the learning topics and therefore an increased learning opportunity.",

Major critique points included 1) too many answer possibilities, 2) inadequate correlation between learning material and quiz, and 3) too many technical problems hindering completion of the module. All of these points have been taken into consideration when we revised this specific module as well as designed the additional modules for the SafeBoosC-III web-based training and certification program; at first, we revised and edited all question within the modules so that only one or two correct answer possibilities persisted, in contrast to the previous design where some questions held up to five correct answers. We also scaled the questions so that the maximum number of answer possibilities was limited to five, as opposed to previously having up to ten possibilities. This condensing of the questions required that we split some of the complex questions into two or more focused questions, thereby creating a larger pool of questions per learning objective. Secondly, for each module, we cross-checked the content of the learning material with questions in the quiz in order to identify inconsistencies. If such were found, relevant content was added to the learning material in order to ensure adequate coverage of the learning material.",
