Over 64 countries are in the development stages of establishing accredited teams, both international and national, to deliver emergency clinical care to sudden onset disasters and outbreak affected populations. EMTs must comply with the classification of minimum standards for EMTs developed in 2013 by the WHO Foreign Medical Team Working Group in the Global Health Cluster. Not infrequently, health providers have had to learn quickly that their specialty training alone was not enough that they lack the operational skills sets and collaborative leadership capacity required for the demands of resource, poor decision-making during the complexities of public health emergencies such as epidemics. Under the EMT concept all countries share the responsibility to ensure that cross disciplinary, competency-based knowledge in field-related tasks to practice globally with high standards of care [12] An essential component to improve WHO EMT quality and accountability of national and international EMTs is appropriate education and training. Multiple disaster education and training programs are available, however, most are centered on individual professional development rather than on the EMTs operational performance. No common overarching or standardized training framework exist [13]. A proposed three-step learning process approach for EMTs is: (1) professional competence; (2) adaptation to the operational context; and (3) team performance. Training delivery should go from theory to practice and from individual to team training [14].",

Simulation can also reach individuals wherever they are during mobilization for disaster relief in remote areas, including team training of individuals even before the team is geographically assembled. GHS training must balance the use of technology, with its probable absence in operational environments.

Simulation requires an instructional design framework to assist educators in creating appropriate simulation learning experiences. Simulation includes vastly different educational modalities. The framework for simulation instructional design has four domains:(1) Instructional medium; (2) simulation modality; (3) instructional method; (4) presentation. Each simulation modality is best suited for specific competency domains and learning outcomes. The choices within each domain are based on a matrix of simulation relating the severity of possible outcomes to the frequency of events, with a corresponding optimal \u201cZone of simulation matrix\u201d [46].",

Debriefing of learners after SBT session has been proposed as the primary learning method, with different models of debriefing depending upon the scenarios and knowledge level of learners [47]. Debriefing is a critical component of the simulation experience. Facilitators guide the students for the management of the scenario by discussing the learning objectives and providing feedback on the students performances.

Several concepts associated with fidelity are more useful in explaining educational effectiveness, such as transfer of learning, learner engagement, and suspension of disbelief. It is been proposed to abandon the term fidelity in SBT and replace it with terms reflecting the underlying primary concepts of physical resemblance and functional task alignment, and shift from the current physical emphasis or emphasis on physical resemblance to a focus on functional correspondence between the simulator and applied context [63].",

Novice pilots can become overwhelmed with total fidelity. This is because initially novice pilots must first familiarize themselves with the look, shape, location, and feel the actual devices in the cockpit and in the memorization and execution of emergency procedures. It can therefore be deduced that high fidelity is desired in simulation-based assessment devices that attempt to predicted expert performance in real-world situations.

Low fidelity models may be equivalent or better for novice trainees. It is difficult to predict which model might be best for training. Structural fidelity such as physical resemblance may be higher in one model such as a human patient simulator, and functional fidelity such as tissue feel enforces required may be higher in the live tissue model [66]. While learners may prefer life tissue training over simulation there is been no difference in performance between learners training simulators versus live tissue models [67]. There is also the cost of the life of an animal to consider and labor to prepare animal models which is increased over synthetic models [68].

These drills are expensive to provide and require abundant resources, including volunteers to play patients, moulage artists, and participation by many healthcare and safety personnel, taking instructors and trainees away from their normal duties for extended periods of time. Despite the cost and disruption of organizing and running major incident exercises there is little evidence of their effectiveness in improving the preparedness of an organization for a major incident response. Low-cost virtual worlds have been successfully developed and tested for preparation and training multiagency and multisite major incident responses. Virtual environments are more immersive over tabletop exercises, placing participants into a realistic and stressful environment which can be based upon their local or novel surroundings. Scenarios can be reset rerun within seconds to maximize the resource availability and cost effectiveness, enabling participants to perform and gain an understanding of multiple key roles. The ability to record and playback the scenarios from a point of view of each participant enables accurate and structured debriefing, either by expert facilitators or peers, which is difficult to achieve in a large-scale live or tabletop exercise. Virtual worlds also have the advantage of replicating exactly out location resources in a healthcare facility.

Educational game design and development is a process of defining learning and assessment goals, determining what is needed to achieve those goals, developing an appropriate simulation, and validating its effectiveness. The methodology often used is the ADDIE instructional design model of analysis, design, development, improvement, and evaluate. Portions of the methodology may require a compromise between educators and developers because instruction and assessment requirements may dictate selection of a particular genre platform. Learning outcomes from simulations also depend how well the domain instruction is integrated into the simulation due to cognitive load theory. Cognitive load is the total amount of mental activity imposed on working memory at a point in time. Extraneous cognitive load is a load caused by any unnecessary stimuli. These are key design considerations when designing educational games [113]. Achieving the proper balance between entertainment and instruction in a game is essential and can be difficult to attain. Serious games are an experiential activity, rather than a presentation requiring memorization of facts. Learning goals and gameplay are often not disclosed to the user. Often the user learns by playing the game, where discovery in itself may be part of the gameplay [114].",

Flow is a mental state in which the person is fully engaged, focused, and committed to the success of the activity. Inducing a flow state is a key goal in game-based learning. A learner cannot consciously force themselves into a flow state, but three conditions make flow more likely: (1) the learner must be immersed in an activity which the goals are clearly stated; (2) the learner must believe they possess the skills to overcome the perceived challenge; (3) the task must include prompting coherent feedback allowing learned to adjust their performance to accommodate changing demands [106].",

Game development requires expertise in GHS, education, and technology development to create the complex design, modeling, and scoring required to make an effective game. Game development can be costly and require lengthy development time. Proposed frameworks for game development have been proposed using a three-phase development process. The first phase is preparation and design. This includes identifying and funding the appropriate members needed to develop the technical components i.e. game developers, GHS content subject matter experts, and users. A development schedule to include frequent meeting should be agreed upon. The second component in this phase is a subject matter concepts transfer. The SMEs demonstrate how to perform tasks, allowing game developers to ask questions and take notes and photographs for reference. One of the key challenges in game development is difficulty conveying expert concepts to nonexpert developers. Concepts transfer helps orient the game developers to the information to be shared or used in the game. Content production, including any necessary physiological modeling incorporating existing evidence, guidelines, and expert derived algorithms is completed during this phase with storyboards describing the flow and required functionality of the game. The second phase is development of wireframes, which are illustrations of proposed game components and assist in visual communication design of the structure, functionality, and learner interface. The third phase is a formative evaluation. This starts with usability testing to identify content, design, functionality, and usability problems with the game, and should include both subject matter experts and end-users. After usability testing is complete and all edits have been made, the final product is delivered for beta testing [115].",
