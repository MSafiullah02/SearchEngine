The technology will provide miniaturized set-ups enabling us to perform multiplexed profiling of minute amounts of biological samples in a highly specific, selective, and sensitive manner. In this review, we describe the potential and specific use of protein microarray technology, including both functional protein microarrays and affinity protein microarrays, for the detection and identification of bacteria, bacterial proteins as well as bacterial diseases. To date, the first generations of a variety of set-ups, ranging from small-scale focused biosensors to large-scale semi-dense array layouts for multiplex profiling have been designed. This work has clearly outlined the potential of the technology for a broad range of applications, such as serotyping of bacteria, detection of bacteria and/or toxins, and detection of tentative diagnostic biomarkers. The use of the protein microarray technology for detection and identification of bacterial and protein analytes is likely to increase significantly in the coming years.",

A minute quantity ( L scale) of the biological sample, e.g., serum, is then incubated on the array and any specifically bound analytes can be detected using mainly fluorescence as a read-out system. Adopting a high-performing setup, assay sensitivities in the pM to fM range can be observed, allowing low-abundance analytes to be readily targeted even in complex samples (Pawlak et al. 2002; Wingren et al. 2005; Wingren et al. 2006) . Depending on the assay setup at hand, the observed microarray binding pattern can then be converted into, for example, a protein-ligand interaction profile, a (differential) protein expression profile, or even a proteomic map revealing the detailed composition of the proteome at the molecular level (MacBeath 2002; Wingren and Borrebaeck 2004; Kingsmore 2006) .",

While functional protein microarrays examine the biochemical activity, such as ligand binding properties and reactivity, of a set of immobilized target proteins (MacBeath and Schreiber 2000; Zhu et al. 2000 Zhu et al. , 2001 Phizicky et al. 2003) ; affinity microarrays utilize affinity reagents as probes to detect and measure the abundance of multiple proteins in a (semi-) quantitative way (Haab 2003; Borrebaeck 2004, 2006a ). As will be described in this review, both classes of protein microarrays have been used for detection and identification of bacteria and bacterial protein analytes, and the different protein array technology platforms have already been shown to display great promise within biomedical and biotechnological applications (Table 26 .1). In this context, it might be of interest to note that protein-based microarray applications have recently emerged in a similar manner also for the detection of viruses, viral proteins, and viral diseases (Perrin et al. 2003; Yuk et al. 2004; Livingston et al. 2005; Lu et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2006 ).",

In particular, the use of cDNA expression libraries as the probe source has been very rewarding (Zhu et al. 2000 (Zhu et al. , 2001 Horn et al. 2006) . For example, microarrays composed of 119 of 122 yeast protein kinases (Zhu et al. 2000) , 5,800 of 6,200 yeast proteins (Zhu et al. 2001) , or 37,200 redundant recombinant fetal brain proteins (Horn et al. 2006 ) have been designed, fabricated, and successfully applied to perform global protein-protein interaction studies. To date, mainly water-soluble protein analytes have been targeted, but the first microarray design also targeting membrane proteins in the format of intact mammalian cells has recently been published (Deviren et al. 2007 ). Functional protein arrays have frequently been applied within the academic research community, but several commercial ventures have also developed such microarrays that are now available on the market. For example, focused microarrays targeting cell signaling proteins and tentative cancer-associated proteins have been launched by Sigma (http://www.sigma.com). In addition, comprehensive microarrays based on over 8,000 human recombinant proteins have recently been released by both Protagen (http://protagen.de) and Invitrogen (http://invitrogen.com).",

In parallel with all the academic efforts, several commercial products have been launched, mainly for focused assays (protein expression profiling) and point-of-care applications (Wingren and Borrebaeck 2004) ; although larger arrays have also started to emerge on the market (e.g., http://www.clontech.com, http://www.raybiotech.com, http://www.protneteomix.com, http://www.whatman.com, http:// www.sigmaaldrich.com). As for functional protein arrays, mainly water-soluble analytes have been targeted (Wingren and Borrebaeck 2004) , but array designs targeting membrane proteins in the format of intact mammalian cells have recently been published as well (Belov et al. 2001 (Belov et al. , 2003 Ko et al. 2005b Ko et al. , 2005a Campbell et al. 2006; Ellmark et al. 2006a ) (Dexlin, Borrebaeck, and Wingren unpublished) .",

To date, the degree of multiplexity differs, with array designs based on a few single probes ranging up to a few hundred, depending on the actual assay at hand. In more detail, a low degree of multiplexity (\u2264 50 probes) may be sufficient to screen and detect toxins, etc., while a high degree of multiplexity (> 100 probes) may, at least initially, be required to detect, for example, disease-associated protein expression signatures.",

However, these assays often suffer from inadequate sensitivity and subjective visual read-out. In comparison, MS, NMR, and HPLC-based analysis are alternative but time-consuming assays commonly applied for bacterial glycan analysis. In a recent paper, Hsu et al. presented a lectinbased microarray approach for analyzing the dynamic bacterial glycome (Hsu et al. 2006) . The platform was based on 21 lectins on Nexterion H slides, and the arrays were imaged by fluorescence, since the bacteria were directly labeled with SYT 85. The results showed that (1) closely related E. coli strains could be distinguished based on their glycosylation pattern, i.e., enabling fingerprinting; and (2) dynamic alterations in the bacteria glycome could be observed. The range of specificities displayed by lectins is currently a bottleneck, which is why other carbohydrate binding probes, e.g., antibodies, may provide an alternative route.",

The carbohydrates (e.g., mannose and fucose) were dispensed and immobilized onto CodeLink slides, and bound bacteria (directly labeled) were detected by fluorescence. Proof-of-principle was shown for this carbohydrate microarray as a means to detect bacteria, as illustrated by different E. coli strains. In addition, these nondestructive arrays allow the bacteria to be harvested and tested for, e.g., antibacterial susceptibility.",

This feasibility study showed that 88-100 % of the tested E. coli isolates could be correctly classified.

Hence, the results implied that the antibody array setup performed well for O serotyping, providing multiplexed, cost-effective, efficient, and accurate typing.",

This reversed affinity protein microarray is based on the exposure of a cellulosic membrane to a sample potentially containing E. coli. The bacteria is then immobilized (bound) to the membrane and detected by fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. The setup was found to display rapid and selective detection of bacteria with at least three orders of magnitude linear dynamic range. Of note, the assay sensitivity was found to be as low as 20 organisms (in this case E. coli O157:H7). In comparison, Gerhing and coworkers have developed a sandwich fluorescent immunoassay in the microarray format (Gehring et al. 2006) . Biotinylated capture antibodies were immobilized onto streptavidin-modified Superfrost Gold slides, and the setup was evaluated targeting E. coli O157:H7 samples.

(Rowe et al. 1999; Rowe-Taitt et al. 2000; Taitt et al. 2002) . The capture polyclonal and/or monoclonal antibodies were biotinylated and immobilized on neutravidin-derivatized waveguides. Bound analytes (proteins, glycoproteins, Gram-negative, and Gram-positive bacteria) were detected using labeled secondary (tracer) antibodies. The results showed that assay sensitivities in the mid ng/ml range were readily observed targeting, for example, cholera toxin and B. globigii. Moreover, the assay was demonstrated to be rapid (<15 min) and easy to execute. Taken together, these studies have demonstrated proof-of-concept for an inexpensive and multiplex device for simple detection of bacteria and bacterial analytes. In addition, the setup is in a format amenable to automation and portability. In these first studies, the capture antibody spots were in the 2.5 mm 2 size range and generated by physically isolated patterning using polymer flow cells. In recent work, the spot size of the biotinylated capture antibodies has been considerably reduced (0.04 mm 2 ) by adopting a noncontact piezo-based dispenser to fabricate the arrays (Delehanty and Ligler 2002) . Using confocal microscopy for detection, an assay sensitivity in the low ng/ml range was still obtained. Hence the latter study outlined a way of fabricating high-density arrays for bacterial detection, while maintaining assay sensitivity.",

The biochip is composed of spots of capture probes (e.g., antibodies) immobilized on a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active metal surface. Once the chip has been subjected to sampling and target analytes have been bound, a Raman microscope is applied to collect SERS fingerprints from the spots (pixels) on the chip. This interesting technology has been named SERS, as it couples SERS with microscopy. The identification is based on SERS fingerprints, and the authors demonstrated that both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria often could be detected at the strain/subspecies level based on their SERS fingerprints. Further, the SERS fingerprints could also be used to differentiate viable vs. nonviable, e.g., heator UV-killed, microorganisms; different physiological states of the bacteria cells, e.g., when cultured under conditions known to affect virulence; and to detect toxins in a specific and sensitive manner. Work is currently under way to develop the Raman microscope instrumentation even further, to enable the simultaneous collection of hundreds or thousands of spectra from discrete positions on the chip with a spatial resolution of 250 nm to 1.5 m. Future experiments will unravel the potential of this read-out system for protein microarray-based applications.",

Subsequently, these proteins were used as probes in the array format and applied to screen sera from healthy controls vs. patients suffering from meningitis. The results showed that 47 of these proteins were immunogenic, i.e., that an antibody response had been mounted. Nine proteins were found to be immunogenic in at least 3 of 20 meningitis sera tested, while 1 protein showed a response in 11 of 20 sera.

Tuberculosis can be diagnosed by microscopy and culture of mycobacteria of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from clinical samples. Still, these approaches are associated with limitations and technical hurdles. To be proven valuable, a serodiagnostic approach should (1) display a specificity > 90 % (i.e., comparable to microscopy and bacterial cultures), and (2) be able to differentiate/detect multiple disease states.",

The clinical serum samples from healthy controls (non-TB) and tuberculosis (TB) patients were screened for IgG antibodies specific for any of these antigens, e.g., for a serum-specific IgG profile. Based on the analysis of 20 TB sera and 80 non-TB sera, combinations of TB antigens were ranked with respect to specificity and sensitivity of TB detection. The results showed that the highestranking TB antigen combination displayed a receiver operator curve (ROC) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95. Of note, a single antigen, Ara 6 -BSA, was found to give an AUC value of 0.90.

            "text": "Taken together, the first generations of protein-based microarray technology platforms for detection and identification of bacteria, bacterial proteins and bacterial diseases, have in recent years been developed. These miniaturized assay platforms include functional protein microarrays as well as affinity protein microarrays, and the designs range from small-scale focused biosensors targeting a few analytes to large-scale semi-dense microarray set-ups for multiplex screening. A broad range of applications, such as serotyping of bacteria, detection of bacteria, identification of toxins, disease state differentiation, and discovery of diseaseassociated biomarkers, have so far been demonstrated, clearly outlining the potential of the technology. Still, the number of applications is low, but is likely to increase significantly as the microarray technology progress and develops into a robust proteomic technology. In future, protein microarray based applications are likely to play an important role for detection and identification of bacterial and protein analytes.",
