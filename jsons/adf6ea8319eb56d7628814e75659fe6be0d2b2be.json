In this way, a graph is connected in which the likelihood of infectious spread from person to person is determined by the intensity of interpersonal contact. Infectious transfer is determined by chance. The model is extended to incorporate various lockdown scenarios.",

The disease, COVID19, is often characterised by flulike symptoms, which in some cases lead to excessive fever or even to lung inflammations. One of the serious problems regarding this disease is the high infection rate from person to person. In order to protect as many people as possible against the virus, many governments, including in Belgium, Britain and France, implement lockdown strategies. Other countries in Europe choose for herd immunity. Examples of such countries are Netherlands and Sweden. Both the Netherlands and Sweden show, despite their small population sizes, a relatively large mortality [1] . Despite their adopting of a firm lockdown strategy, Italy and Spain regret a high number of mortalities as a result of the Corona virus. Some criticasters claim that these high mortality rates are a consequence of having implemented the lockdown strategy only at a late stadium. Germany, on the other hand, has installed a lockdown strategy, and has registered many cases of infected people, however, fortunately Germany is only effected by a relatively low mortality. A reason for this low mortality rate could be the intensive testing policy that has been carried out by the Germans. Sweden and Netherland could possibly blame their high mortality numbers to the fact that testing is done on a small scale only. Only caregivers and very seriously ill people are tested in Sweden and Netherlands.",

One attempts to include spatial spread by the incorporation of diffusion terms, which are justified by random (unpredictable) migration and interaction of individuals. Other extensions are based on the incorporation of networks, which allows so-called jump processes so that airborne communication can be taken into account. The models described in [5] distinguish several challenges for network modelling in epidemics. The current model elaborates on the influence of the topology of the network on the evolution of the epidemic.",

Each connection between two individuals contains a likelihood that a two individuals infect each other. Of course contact between individuals does not always lead to infection, and hence here a stochastic process is considered. The likelihood that each individual infects another is determined by the intensity of the contacts that the individuals have. Next to being infected, recovery is incorporated and once an individual has recovered, then it is assumed that the individual is immune to the disease. Since COVID19 can be a lethal disease in some cases, death has been incorporated as well. The model has been extended for modelling lockdown policies that certain governments have adopted. One of the advantages of the current approach is the small number of input parameters needed. A further innovation is the uncertainty quantification and the statistical assessment of the results.",

The results have been plotted in Figure 1 . The first three parameter more or less follow the dynamics of the standard SIR models for the dynamics of an epidemic. The number of susceptible people decreases monotonically down to an end value, whereas the infected people increase during the early stages and decrease down to zero at the latest stages. This number has to decrease down to zero eventually since all infected people either recover and hence become resistent, or die. The curve for the infected people shows a slight non-monotonic behaviour due to the stochastic processes that sometimes allow more people to get infected than people transfer to death or recovery or vice versa. Furthermore the number of resistent also grows monotonically since resistent people cannot be infected again, and in the model they will not die of corona. In the first stages, the number of resistent and dead people follows more or less a logistic curve and so does the susceptible fraction. It can be seen that the epidemic has disappeared after a bit more than 100 days. In Figure 2 , we plot the spatial distribution of the same run as in Figure 1 . The red dots represent the infected individuals, the green dots are the resistent people, and the blue dots correspond to the dead people. The white dots are susceptible that have not yet been in contact with the virus. It can be seen that there is an infection wave that spreads through the community over time. This wave is followed by dead and recovered people. Once a person is surrounded by recovered people and no longer interacts with infected people, then this person will never become infected. In this sense, this models protection of some people by resistent people. A weakness of the model is that in the current calculations, someone can be surrounded by dead people only. It is thought that these effects are 'second order effects' and therefore, we will disregard this issue for the time being. In future studies, this issue will be quantified.",

In this simulation, 1000 Monte Carlo samples have been run using the input data set from Table 1. In order to obtain an indication of the Monte Carlo error, we estimate the relative Monte Carlo error of the stochastic variable x b\u0177 Here N , s N , x (j) ,x N , respectively, represent the number of samples, sample standard deviation, value of x at sample j, and the sample mean of x after taking N samples. In our simulations where we carried out 1000 samples, the relative Monte Carlo Error was about 0.02. In Figure 6 , we show Monte Carlo estimates for the cumulative probability distribution for the fractions of died, resistent and susceptible people. It can be seen that the most simulations indicate a fraction of about 0.275, 0.685, and 0.05 with some variation for the dead, resistent, and susceptible people. Furthermore, the duration times vary around 105 days. The cumulative probability densities that are presented in Figure 6 show the results once the epidemic has lasted for at least two weeks. Since the initial condition was taken as one infected node only, it happened in a few cases that the one node transferred from infected to resistent before contamination to other individuals could happen. A probabilistic model is able to predict such rare cases. These cases, and further cases in which the epidemic lasted shorter than two weeks have been ignored in Figure 6 . For completeness, these cases were incorporated in Figure 7 , where histograms for the duration time are presented for several (lockdown) scenarios. Figure 7 shows histograms for various lockdown scenarios where the intensity of the lockdown policy has been varied. It can be seen that the number of occurrences that the epidemic is over within 10 days remains the same (note the scale of the horizontal axis), which is according to expectations since the lockdown strategy is applied after 10 days after viral outbreak. Further, it can be seen that a fierce reduction of interpersonal contact, which decreases the likelihood of contamination, significantly shortens the duration of the epidemic. All scenarios predicted that the epidemic was over within this lockdown period, except for one outlier, which has not be shown Fig. 3 The fractions of susceptible, infected, resistent and dead people as a function of time. A weak lockdown has been applied Fig. 4 The fractions of susceptible (left), infected, resistent and dead people (right) as a function of time. A firm lockdown has been applied. Note the change of scale here. A fierce reduction of inter-personal contact reduces the duration of the epidemic, and reduces the number of casualties and resistent (not shown here) dramatically. A weak lockdown, however, increases the duration of the epidemic.",

The duration of the epidemic is shown versus the severity of lockdown, as well as the fraction of people that are susceptible (who have not been infected) and the resistent (who recovered, but may have permanent health issues), and the dead versus the severity of the lockdown. All plots show a bifurcation, which results from the fact that in some runs the epidemic was over before it could spread significantly. This may happen since both the recovery rate and spreading rate are modelled on the basis of stochastic processes. In reality, this may also happen if the first receiver of the virus recovers before (s)he spreads the virus to other people. Regarding the bifurcating behaviour, in which there is a 'favourable' and 'non-favourable' branch (short duration versus long duration, large susceptible end fraction versus small susceptible end fraction, small resistent/dead end fraction versus large resistent/dead fraction). It can be seen that a more severe lockdown (smaller value of\u03b2 results into a larger number of occurrences in the favourable branch, which suggests a larger likelihood that a favourable scenario occurs in terms of smaller duration interval, smaller amount of dead and recovered people, and a larger number of people that did not develop any symptoms. It can also be seen that a very strict lockdown (reduction to 10 % of the number contacts between people) no occurrences in the non-favourable branch were observed, which means that this will make epidemic die out rapidly with only few casualties. This has been worked out in Figure 9 , where the likelihood of a positive scenario in terms of number of casualties and duration of epidemic has been evaluated for different values of the severeness of the lockdown (\u03b2). The probabilities have been estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Principle. It is clear to see that a more severe lockdown (large reduction of inter-personal Table 1 have been used contacts) increases the likelihood that the epidemic will last during a relatively short time-interval. The same can be observed for the number of deaths.",
