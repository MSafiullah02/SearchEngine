Some researchers have suggested that the infant's immature brainstem respiratory centre plays a role, and an exaggerated inhibitory response leads to reduced breathing effort 5, 6. A second proposed mechanism was related to the infectious status of the respiratory system, regardless of the causative organism. In a prospective study, respiratory arrest was associated with a strong inflammatory response in the mucosa 7. A third proposed mechanism referred to the stimulation of stretch receptors in the lungs, causing a reflectory negative feedback to respiration, known as the Hering\u2013Breuer reflex 8, 9, 10. This reflex is sometimes stronger due to general malaise and muscle fatigue 11, 12, 13. A fourth proposed mechanism was an obstruction of the airways by mucus plugging and stasis in the nose and, or, small airways. Obstructive apnoeas may also lead to subsequent central apnoeas 10.",

As RSV is highly associated with apnoeas 2, 3, several guidelines recommend hospitalising young infants with an RSV infection even if there are no clinical signs that warrant hospital care 25. In contrast to these recommendations, our study revealed that the same proportion of apnoeas was also observed in nonRSV infections and that they occurred irrespective of the causative micro\u2010organism.

A minimum duration of the respiratory arrest was not included in this definition. Most infants with ARI\u2010associated apnoeas receive their care in a general hospital. As a result, the registration of apnoeas during hospitalisation in our study was less accurate than in a PICU setting and was probably under\u2010reported. Furthermore, the phenomenon of apnoea remains a subjective observation when it is not measured with close monitoring of vital parameters, breathing patterns and airflow. Despite these issues, our results stress that parental observations of apnoeas should be taken seriously and are a strong predictor of apnoeas in hospital (Tables 1 and 2).",

The correlation of apnoeas with the DSS supports the view that the inflammatory reaction itself is an important factor when it comes to increasing the risk of apnoeas 7. Activation of the laryngeal chemoreceptors by inflammatory cytokines leads to prolonged respiratory arrest between two breaths 6, and this view is further supported by the observation that apnoeas mainly occur in children with an involvement of the lower respiratory tract. These are both situations in which hypoxia and hypercapnia are more likely to occur. However, the inflammatory response is only partly responsible, because the significance of the DSS decreased after excluding apnoea from the scoring system. Without extensive breathing registration, it is not possible to establish the relative contribution of the brainstem respiratory centre and the inflammatory status. Four of the infants with apnoea in our study were only diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection, and one of these infants suffered from choking periods due to nasal obstruction. As young children obligatory breathe through their nose 29, apnoeas may occur without lower respiratory tract involvement. Excessive mucus production or plugging in these children causes mechanical airway blockage that can easily be resolved by rinsing the nose with saline or using suction or decongestive medication.",

Although the DSS in our study was not validated to predict PICU admittance, the scores of the infants admitted to the PICU were significantly higher than those who stayed on a paediatric ward. A retrospective study of 43 RSV\u2010positive patients who were admitted to a PICU for apnoeas found that the risk factors were younger age, lower admission weight, lower gestational age, admission from the emergency room and the lack of hyperthermia 30. From a clinical point of view, it would be helpful if the DSS could predict which infants with apnoeas required PICU care.",
