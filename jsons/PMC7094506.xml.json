Consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy and complete removal of bile duct stones at the Prince of Wales Hospital were eligible for trial entry if they met all of the following criteria: (1) they were older than 60 years, (2) they received complete endoscopic sphincterotomy (defined by free bile flow and passage of a fully bowed sphincterotome with a 25-mm wire), (3) there was radiological evidence of an intact gallbladder containing gallstones, and (4) there was no previous hospitalization for cholecystitis. In patients with cholangitis, we initially decompressed the bile duct by inserting a nasobiliary catheter or a short stent across the sphincter to avoid aggravating systemic sepsis and contaminating the gallbladder. Definitive stone removal was performed after sepsis resolution. Complete clearance of the bile duct was ensured by obtaining a balloon occlusion cholangiogram at the end of procedure. Patients were excluded if there was evidence of concomitant intrahepatic ductal stones, radiological evidence of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, no consent to trial entry, or intercurrent malignancy with a limited life span or if they were deemed unfit for cholecystectomy (those belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists grade IV or V).",

Our randomized trial has a median follow-up of >5 years. The only other randomized study that examined the need for cholecystectomy after endoscopic sphincterotomy came from a Dutch group.16 Their reported recurrence rate among patients managed expectantly was 47%. They concluded that adding cholecystectomy would be recommended after endoscopic treatment of bile duct stones. Their trial, however, differed from ours in several aspects. First, our trial represented a single-center experience, and consecutive patients with bile duct stones were accounted for. Second, the age distribution of patients included in the other study was much wider, whereas our sample contained patients >60 years. In our opinion, young patients should be offered elective cholecystectomy. Gallstone disease is a risk factor for gallbladder cancers. Third, outcome events in the Dutch trial were predominantly gallbladder related; 31% of patients were operated on for biliary pain and 12% for acute cholecystitis. Cholecystectomies were performed at a median of 11 weeks after sphincterotomy. Our lower rate of recurrences contrasted with that of the Dutch trial. Outcome events in our study were mostly cholangitis. Neither trial distinguished between primary and secondary bile duct stones.",

This was again observed in our study. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed early to gain maximal efficacy in preventing cholecystitis. In approximately 10% of our patients assigned to cholecystectomy, acute cholecystitis was present at operation. In patients with cholangitis or pancreatitis, gallbladders, being part of the biliary tree, are often found inflamed at early cholecystectomy. Gallbladders may have been contaminated during instrumentation and occlusion cholangiogram at ERCP. In our protocol, we endeavored to reduce such risks by providing initial drainage to the bile duct before definitive removal of stones in patients with cholangitis. After resolution of biliary sepsis, the rate of subsequent cholecystitis is, however, lower. Patients with nonfilling of their gallbladders at ERCP were thought to be at risk of subsequent cholecystitis and biliary pain.17 Because of the small number of outcome events in our trial, an ancillary analysis would be of limited value.",

Some have suggested that ablation of the sphincter could lead to ascending biliary tract infection from enteric organisms and, thereby, increase the risk of cholecystitis. In a randomized study that compared endoscopic sphincterotomy and balloon sphincteroplasty in the treatment of bile duct stones, acute cholecystitis occurred in 7 of 71 patients treated by sphincterotomy, as compared with 1 of 75 patients assigned to balloon sphincter dilation.18 Other studies showed that endoscopic sphincterotomy reduces gallbladder filling and increases gallbladder emptying. Augmented gallbladder contractility may in theory reduce the risk of acute cholecystitis.19, 20 The issue is largely unresolved.",

The European Society of Gerontology defined an elderly patient to be someone older than 65. Patients should, however, be assessed by their physiological rather than chronological ages. Using the same argument, we did not impose an upper age limit during recruitment. Second, a significant proportion of our patients, as a result of advanced age or perceived comorbid illnesses, were unwilling to undertake surgery with its attendant risks and, therefore, did not participate. Patients who entered the trial could represent a group with less risk. The scenario is, however, closer to real clinical practice, in which elderly patients are often reluctant to receive cholecystectomy after successful endoscopic sphincterotomy and clearance of bile duct stones. Third, Hong Kong Chinese may have a higher incidence of primary pigment stones when compared with the white population. The inclusion of such patients in our trial may explain the higher rate of recurrent cholangitis and a lower rate of cholecystitis. Our findings may therefore not be extrapolated to the Western population.",

Interval elective ERCP can be a treatment option in patients predicted to develop recurrent bile duct stones.21 A larger bile duct is the only consistent factor identified.22 It is interesting to note that none of the recurrent events was pancreatitis. Ablation of the sphincter may have therefore prevented calculous impaction and bile reflux into the pancreatic duct. We did not show a difference in late deaths with cholecystectomy.

The conversion rate increased to 50% when laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed at recurrence. Morbidities in our series were sufficiently low, and mostly complications were minor. The higher procedure-related morbidities are to be borne in mind when we offer surgery to elderly patients with complicated gallstone diseases. The timing of cholecystectomy in patients recovering from cholangitis or pancreatitis has been a subject of controversy. Some surgeons argue for early cholecystectomy, whereas others urge waiting for inflammation to subside before surgery. In our series, the lead time to surgery was often a practical consideration.
