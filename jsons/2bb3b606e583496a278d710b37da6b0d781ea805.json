The decomposition methods have been reported in previous studies. 6, 8 Decomposition breaks down the underlying patterns of time series into seasonality and longterm trends. The seasonal trend in the infection series can be expressed using seasonal indices. To calculate the seasonal factors, overall incidences are first averaged, and then the averaged incidence is divided by the mean incidence for each month. For example, the average incidence of malaria was 0.1344/100 000 during the 10 years and the mean incidence in May was 0.1059/ 100 000, thus the seasonal index for May is 0.788 (0.1344/0.1059). Seasonality shows the periodic fluctuations that are usually caused by known factors such as rainfall, temperature, timing of the holidays, etc. If the seasonal index is greater than 1, it means that the incidence is higher than the average level. Otherwise, it means that the incidence is lower than the average level. The trend cycle represents the long-term changes in the infection. After the seasonal indices have been calculated, one can deseasonalize the data by dividing by the corresponding index.
