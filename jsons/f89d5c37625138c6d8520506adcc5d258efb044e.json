In the absence of any antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies, the disease is spreading at an alarming rate.

However, its efficacy and potency have to be evaluated and validated. Since vaccines have high failure rates, as an alternative, we are presenting a new, designed multi-peptide subunit-based epitope vaccine against COVID-19. The recombinant vaccine construct comprises an adjuvant, cytotoxic Tlymphocyte (CTL), helper T-lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell epitopes joined by linkers. The computational data suggest that the vaccine is non-toxic, non-allergenic, thermostable, with the capability to elicit a humoral and cell-mediated immune response. The stabilization of the vaccine construct is validated with molecular dynamics simulation studies. This unique vaccine is made up of 33 highly antigenic epitopes from three proteins that have a prominent role in hostreceptor recognition, viral entry, and pathogenicity. We advocate this vaccine must be synthesized and tested urgently as a public health priority.",

On 30 th January 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. Human to human transmission occurs through droplets, contact, and fomites. People with COVID-19 show symptoms of fever, cough, muscle aches, headache, and diarrhea.

A specific RT-PCR-based test has been developed that is in use for clinical diagnoses [3] . The abundance of publications in the first three months of 2020 indicates the intensive scientific effort to address both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic routes for treating COVID-19 [4] . More than 200 clinical trials are currently underway to test novel and repurposed compounds against SARS-CoV-2 [5, 6] . Certain drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and remdesivir, are being tested in clinical trials [7] [8] [9] . One small study reported that combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin reduced the detection of viral RNA compared to control [10, 11] . A recent openlabel trial with two protease inhibitors, lopinavir, and ritonavir, failed [12] . Several inactivated vaccines, viral vectored vaccines (adenovirus vector, ankara vector), nanoparticle-based vaccines, fusion-protein based vaccines, adjuvanted vaccines, recombinant protein, and DNA vaccines, as well as live-attenuated vaccines, are also being developed and tested, but these vaccines are many months away from the market [13] [14] [15] [16] . A phase 1 clinical trial of Moderna's mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine, mRNA-1273, has started on March 16, 2020 [17] [18] [19] .

To enter the host cells, the virus uses a densely glycosylated spike protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with high affinity 4 [21, 22] . Structural and biochemical studies suggest that the RBD has an ultra-high binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor [23] . Few groups have designed subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2; however, their workflow involved either use of single protein for vaccine design [24, 25] or used only CTL epitopes without considering the importance of B-cell or HTL epitopes [26] . Some subunit-vaccines are also in preclinical trials [27, 28] . Here, we focused on designing a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 using 33 highly antigenic epitopes. We believe that experimental evaluation may result in a novel and immunogenic vaccine that may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

For this, the clusters of stable states of PCA for the TLR3-vaccine complex were visualized and analyzed.

The M protein is responsible for the assembly and immunogenicity of virus particles. The S protein mediates the entrance of the virus to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptor ACE2. The S protein has two regions: S1, for host cell receptor binding; and S2, for membrane fusion. The S protein is a key target for the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics for coronavirus [15, 37, 38] . Although the S protein is a promising immunogen for protection, optimizing antigen design is critical to ensure an optimal immune response. Our vaccine contains a suitable adjuvant, HTL, CTL, and B-cell epitopes that are joined by suitable linkers. Furthermore, the epitopes were screened for their toxicity potential.",

Hence, it can be used in immune-suppressed patients as well and elicit long-lived immunity.

The complex structure of the TLR3-vaccine was initially optimized using Schr\u00f6dinger Maestro (Schr\u00f6dinger Release 2016-4: Maestro, Schr\u00f6dinger, New York) and subsequently used as the starting structure for MD simulations.First, hydrogen atoms were added to the complex, which was then solvated in an octahedral box of a simple point charge (SPC) water in the center at least 1.0 nm from the box edge. The system was subsequently electrostatically neutralized by the addition of appropriate counter ions. MD simulation was carried out with GROMACS 5.1.2 software package using the gromos96 54A7 force-field. A standard MD simulation protocol started with 50000 steps of energy minimization until no notable change of energy was observed, followed by a heating step from 0 to 300 K in 200 ps (canonical ensemble) and 1000 ps at 300 K (isobaric-isothermal ensemble) by constant temperature equilibration. During this, Parrinello-Rahman barostat pressure coupling was used to avoid the impact of velocity. As a final step of the simulation, 40 ns production run was carried out at 300 K with periodic boundary conditions in the NPT ensemble with modified Berendsen temperature coupling and at a constant pressure of 1 atm. Further, the LINCS algorithm, along with the Particle-mesh Ewald method, was used for the calculation of long-range electrostatic forces. Fourier grid spacing and Coulomb radius were set at 0.16 and 1.4 nm, respectively, during the simulations. The van der Waals (VDW) interactions were limited to 1.4 nm, and",

The radius of gyration, which represents the compactness of the TLR3-vaccine complex, was analyzed using the gmx gyrate tool of GROMACS utilities. Hydrogen bonds weredetermined using the hydrogen bonds module of visual molecular dynamics (VMD) throughout the 40 ns duration. The intermolecular and intramolecular interactions formed between TLR3 and the vaccine subunit were computed and visualized in Molecular Operating Environment 7 software. Several snapshots of the TLR3-vaccine complexes were extracted from the MD simulations, and various interactions formed among them were computed. Essential dynamics (ED), which represent the principal motion directions by a set of eigenvectors, was performed from the MD simulation trajectory of TLR3-vaccine complex. In this analysis, a variance/covariance matrix was constructed by calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and their projection along the first two principal components was monitored by principal component analysis (PCA). The eigenvalues associated with each of the eigenvectors of the TLR3-vaccine complex were used to calculate the percentage of variability.",

In total, the complex formed about 5369 bonds during the 40 ns simulation run. Next, we further computed the contact energy for the vaccine-TLR3 complex, and it was found that while the starting complex structure exhibited total contact energy of \u2212814.36 kcal.mol -1 , the stabilized complex exhibited total contact energy of \u2212935.68 kcal.mol -1 , showing the increased stability during MD simulations.
