In 2002, Wang and colleagues\n37\n published in PNAS a prototype DNA chip capable of simultaneously detecting hundreds of viruses. After the extraction of nucleic acids from the sample and their random amplification by PCR, sequences labeled by a fluorochrome were hybridized onto the microchip and optically detected. A second version carrying 10,000 oligonucleotides targeting approximately 1000 viruses permitted the identification of the SARS virus in 2003.\n38\n While the Virochip is a very strong research tool, it remains too complex for use in routine diagnostics. In 2007, an Austrian team proposed a DNA chip which, after genomic amplification, allowed the parallel detection of 25 different pathogens (bacteria and fungi). The observed detection limits varied from 10 bacteria (Escherichia coli) to 105 bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) per mL of artificially spiked blood.\n39\n The use of DNA chips also represents an efficient approach for the rapid detection of genetic variations of a given virus, as shown by the team of Rios and colleagues\n40\n monitoring the genetic variations of the West Nile virus. Recently in Nature Reviews Microbiology, Ecker and coworkers\n41\n presented an original strategy using only six pairs of primers to amplify the genomes of 373 bacteria. The analysis of amplicons was performed by mass spectrometry on a new industrial platform (Ibis 5000). Thus, for the detection of infectious agents, the difficulties of multiplex amplification may be bypassed by developing random PCR procedures, as is the case with the Virochip approach, or generic PCR procedures targeting conserved regions of the bacterial or viral genome and allowing the simultaneous amplification of numerous sequences, which are then analyzed by hybridization on chips presenting probes specific to the target sequences. Other microarray developments have been proposed for pathogen detection and several systems are today commercialized for use in biodefense applications.\n42\n However, microarray technology coupled with molecular fluorophore probes has several limitations. These include the need for target amplification and fluorophore labeling, slow binding kinetics between target sequence and probe, and in the case of multiplexed analysis, overlapping spectral features of the fluorophores, nonuniform photobleaching rates, the need for multiple\u2010laser excitation sources, and complex, expensive instrumentation.\n43\n Finally, few systems have to date received official approval allowing their commercialization for use in clinical diagnostics.\n13\n\n",

This technique, while at present not suitable for high\u2010throughput detection, has been applied to the detection of bacteria and viruses but is above all used to measure the affinity constants between antigen and antibody or reaction kinetics.

Many studies have been published describing their application in the food and environmental industries for the rapid detection of bacteria and viruses.\n51\n, \n59\n, \n60\n The development of potentiometric biosensors is much more recent and is encountering many difficulties (sensitivity, reproducibility, need for secondary antibody labeling) in translating biologic binding events.\n51\n On the other hand, impedancemetric biosensors offer several advantages for use in diagnostics, notably by allowing the measurement of antigen\u2010antibody interactions in real time and without the need for labeling. The signals measured are directly proportional to the concentration of the target molecule.\n51\n, \n56\n, \n59\n Compared to optical biosensors, these biosensors offer the advantage of not being affected by the turbidity of the sample, by the fluorescence of certain molecules of biologic interest, or by the quenching by certain substances. In addition, the instrumentation is simple, economic, and easily miniaturized. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is a very efficient technique to measure biologic binding events at the surface of an electrode.\n51\n The chemistry at the surface of the electrode determines the sensitivity and the specificity of the biosensor. To evaluate this method for pathogen detection, we developed an immunosensor on a bacterial model using a biotinylated E. coli antibody linked to a self\u2010assembled monolayer at the surface of a gold electrode. A linear relationship between the electrochemical measurements and the decimal logarithmic value of E. coli concentrations was found ranging from 10 to 103 colony\u2010forming units (CFUs)/mL. These preliminary results obtained using a conventional electrochemical cell (pure cultures diluted in saline buffer) showed a considerable improvement against the sensitivity of 107 CFUs/mL obtained by SPR optical detection.\n61\n The antibodies used in this electrochemical impedance spectroscopy biosensor were then coupled to magnetic nanoparticles.\n62\n This coupling allowed the simultaneous purification of species of interest and their concentration on the microelectrode by the simple use of a magnet, thus leading to the functionalization of the microelectrode to detect the corresponding antigen. Methods used in this work enabling an improved detection signal\n62\n are currently being developed. Finally, conductimetric biosensors, characterized by their large sensitivity, represent a new pertinent class of analytical systems for diagnostic applications.\n56\n We have evaluated the possibility of using simple conductimetric transducers to measure antigen\u2010antibody interactions using E. coli detection as a model. The nanoparticles funtionalized by the E. coli antibody were immobilized onto a conductimetric transducer. Results showed an excellent sensitivity on E. coli cultures with a detection limit of 1 CFU/mL coupled with a good specificity of binding.\n63\n The encouraging preliminary results obtained over the past 2 years\n61\n, \n62\n, \n63\n, \n64\n have led to further developments for the application of electrochemical biosensors in viral detection.

            "text": "The bio\u2010barcode test, originally developed by Mirkin and colleagues,\n96\n, \n97\n, \n98\n, \n99\n is an ultrasensitive system of amplification and detection of nucleic acids or proteins. It uses two types of particles to perform purification, amplification, and detection steps (cf. Fig. 1). The first particle is a magnetic microparticle consisting of a target recognition probe: in the case of DNA, this probe is an oligonucleotide complementary to the target DNA and in the case of protein the recognition probe is a monoclonal antibody. The second particle is a nanoparticle bearing a recognition element that is complementary to another region of the target molecule, the result being a sandwich\u2010based capture assay. This second element would be either an oligonucleotide in the case of a nucleic acid target or a polyclonal antibody if the target was a protein. In addition, this second particle is functionalized with hundreds of oligonucleotide tags or barcodes. These tags classically measure around 15\u2010 to 20\u2010mer, theoretically giving rise to 420 different possible combinations, permitting the association of one particular tag with each recognized analyte. The application of a magnetic field leads to the purification of complexes formed in the rest of the sample. The barcode tags are then released either chemically or by heating and identified by a sensitive system of detection (for example, the scanometric method). Thus, the DNA barcode acts as a reporter of the targeted molecule that corresponds to signal amplification. It is therefore possible to directly detect the DNA with zeptomolar sensitivity (10\u221221 mol/L or 333 DNA copies/mL) making it as sensitive as PCR but avoiding the need for enzymes.\n97\n With regard to proteins, this test reaches attomolar sensitivity (10\u221218 mol/L), corresponding to a sensitivity 1 million times higher than that of ELISA tests.\n98\n, \n99\n, \n100\n This technique was applied in a microplate format to the multiplex detection of four types of synthetic DNA (HBV, Ebola, HIV, and smallpox) in a concentration of 500 fmol/L (0.5 pmol/L) within 6 hours.\n43\n Also using this method, Tang and coworkers\n101\n more recently showed that it was possible to detect the antigen p24 of the virus HIV with femtomolar sensitivity. This is 150\u2010fold more sensitive than the conventional ELISA with the advantage of an earlier screening of seroconversion (a gain of 3 days). This modified bio\u2010barcode assay was developed on p24 antibody\u2013coated microplates to capture viral antigen and streptavidin\u2010coated nanoparticle\u2010based bio\u2010barcode DNAs for signal amplification followed by detection using a chip\u2010based scanometric method. The preliminary results obtained in plasma samples demonstrated the potential applicability of nanotechnology in viral diagnostics, in particular, in resource\u2010limited settings where NAT is not feasible.\n101\n A second study based on the direct capture of HIV\u2010p24 antigen in 160 \u00b5L of plasma confirmed the superiority of the bio\u2010barcode approach compared to ELISA for the detection of the antigen p24 of HIV. A sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99% was obtained on 112 samples of plasma from infected subjects with a detection range between 4.2 fmol/L (0.1 pg/mL approx. corresponding to 1000 virus particles/mL or 2000 RNA copies/mL) and 420 pmol/L (10 ng/mL) HIV\u2010p24 antigen.\n102\n The bio\u2010barcode assay was also used for the direct detection of genomic double\u2010stranded DNA using the bacterial model Bacillus subtilis, a model close to Bacillus anthracis (anthrax).\n103\n This sensitive assay (2.5 fmol/L) represents the first step in the transition of the bio\u2010barcode laboratory test toward a rapid and sensitive test for the detection of agents used as bioweapons. Elsewhere, the bio\u2010barcode test was combined with a capillary analyzer for the multiplex detection of the synthetic DNA of four viruses (HBV, Ebola, HIV, and smallpox) in a concentration of 5 pmol/L within 40 minutes.\n104\n Recently, antibody pairs were selected allowing the detection of the recombinant prion protein in a bio\u2010barcode test.\n105\n The concept of the bio\u2010barcode is particularly original and represents a potential alternative to the classic technologies of PCR and ELISA.",

            "text": "One of the objectives for developing microfluidic systems is the conception of a truly integrated laboratory\u2010type platform on a chip. The lab\u2010on\u2010a\u2010chip can be imagined as a glass or silicon plate onto which microcanals and microreservoirs have been engraved within which the sample to be analyzed and the reagents circulate. Different strategies are possible for the design of integrated systems.\n84\n, \n94\n, \n106\n, \n107\n, \n108\n One recent review published in Nature highlights the impact of these integrated systems on public health, particularly in developing countries. Microfluidic technologies allow miniaturization and integration of complex functions, which could move sophisticated diagnostic tools out of the developed\u2010world laboratory.\n109\n When demonstrating the practicability of new techniques, an effort should be made to integrate sample preparation from \u201craw\u201d clinical samples and compare detection sensitivity to conventional methods.\n84\n In 2005, Lin and colleagues\n110\n developed a miniaturized immunoassay using microchannels and gold nanoparticles, which allows the direct detection of Helicobacter pylori and E. coli antigens at levels equivalent to conventional ELISA. Another microchip\u2010based sensor using paramagnetic particles was proposed by Aytur and coworkers\n111\n for the detection of antibodies directed against the dengue virus in biologic samples. This biosensor showed a very good correlation with measurements made with ELISA; in 2008, the bio\u2010barcode approach was integrated into a microfluidic chip, marking an important step toward automation.\n112\n Here, the prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA) was chosen as a protein target and was detected at concentrations as low as 0.5 fmol/L. The bio\u2010barcode assay for on\u2010chip PSA detection offers a sensitivity of detection 4 orders of magnitude higher than commercial ELISA tests. These proof\u2010of\u2010concept experiments have helped establish that this microfluidic device has the capacity to detect biomarkers at ultralow concentrations within a biologic sample.\n112\n Although much of the work in the past has focused on the development of sensing methods, magnetic label\u2013based assays are now being incorporated into instruments that incorporate sample fluidics.\n94\n Through the convergence of nano\u2010 and microtechnologies, various new approaches are now in development. Liu and coworkers\n113\n described a disposable electrochemical immunosensor that integrates the immunochromatographic strip technique with an electrochemical immunoassay and exploits QDs as labels to amplify the signal. Immunoglobulin (Ig)G was used as a model analyte and, in this study, QDs were used as labels with which to tag anti\u2010IgG by electrochemical immunosensing. A sandwich immunoreaction was performed. After dissolution of the captured QDs, the released metal ions were detected by highly sensitive voltammetric measurements. This very simple miniaturized system was successfully applied to the detection of PSA in human serum and provides a new tool for protein biomarker detection. Another microfluidic immunoassay using QDs, this time as optical labels, was proposed for the multiplex analysis of viruses HBV, HCV, and HIV antibodies in the pmol/L range.\n114\n Lien and colleagues\n115\n developed a microfluidic platform to automatically collect, incubate, mix, purify, and enrich virus samples using magnetic beads and microfluidic systems. This device was used to successfully perform the purification and enrichment of dengue virus. Very recently, this research group presented an innovative fluorescent\u2010based microfluidic system for the rapid serologic analysis of IgM and IgG associated with the dengue virus infection by utilizing virus\u2010bound magnetic beads. In this microfluidic system, 100 \u00b5L of serum sample is loaded into the sample chamber of the integrated device and the entire process is performed within 30 minutes.\n116\n Another approach exploiting magnetic beads in a microfluidic chip was developed to discriminate the pathologic form of the prion protein from its normal form. This microfluidic enzymatic reactor based on proteinase K\u2013grafted magnetic beads exploits the differences in enzymatic susceptibility between the two forms.\n117\n Magnetic nanotags have also been developed in ultrasensitive assays based on magnetic signals. Since biologic samples lack a detectable magnetic background signal and therefore do not interfere with the magnetic transduction mechanism, the magnetic nanosensor technology is well suited for multiplex protein detection in clinical samples, as described recently in PNAS\n\n118\n and Nature Medicine.\n119\n Osterfeld and coworkers\n118\n implemented magnetic nanotag\u2010based detection on a protein chip, which has an array of 64 sensors and a 200\u2010\u00b5L reaction well placed on top, allowing easy pipetting and aspiration of reagents. The multianalyte capacity, high sensitivity (reaching the low fmol/L concentration range), scalability, and ease of use of this technology in serum samples make it a strong candidate for use in multiplexed molecular diagnostics. This approach has been characterized in detail for several candidate analytes to prove its generality and its superiority to ELISA.\n119\n, \n120\n In particular, this method overcomes the drawbacks of biologic matrices concerning interference and the limited sensitivity, specificity, and multiplexing capacity of the majority of protein detection platforms. This magnetic nanosensor technology can be used for multiplexing, with 64 assays performed on the same device at sensitivities reaching 1000\u2010fold that of ELISA and an extensive linear dynamic range of over 6 orders of magnitude for diverse biologic fluids.\n119\n\n",

Monitoring should remain rigorous, however, for the early detection of any eventual new variants and emerging infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, parasites, or prions). The development of multiplex and flexible tests allowing the simultaneous analysis of pathogens presenting a transfusional risk remains a challenge. Most of the development concerning microtechnologies and in particular chips has largely been for research applications. On the other hand, few systems have been commercialized for use in diagnostics due to the consistent rapid discovery of technological and commercial constraints. Furthermore, multiplex amplification of viral or bacterial genomes is technically very challenging. DNA microarray\u2013based technology has limitations including the need for target amplification and fluorophore labeling that increase analysis costs and the time to obtain results. Inherent autofluorescence or optical absorption of many biologic samples or reagents are also a major limiting factor in ELISAs and protein microarrays since the readout is based on a fluorescent or colorimetric signal. Technological advances over the past 10 years have enabled the conception of a second generation of biosensors combining microtechnologies and nanotechnologies, opening up new avenues to explore other potential applications. New nanotools are now available helping improve sample preparation and capture of the biologic target of interest. The properties of nanoparticles will take multiplexing far beyond what can be achieved using molecular labels. These new devices offer a potentially greater flexibility and higher multiplexing capabilities than conventional optical\u2010based detection methods. The signal amplification approaches could replace those of target amplification (PCR, transcription\u2010mediated amplification) exploited in the platforms in current use for genomic diagnostics. Other principles of detection that avoid fluorescent labeling could be applied to molecular diagnostics. Electrochemical detection is not affected by the turbidity of the sample and can be miniaturized and multiplexed relatively easily. In addition, electrochemical biosensors show good analytical performance and allow the direct detection in real time of molecular targets. As such, these biosensors are undergoing rapid development and yet much more is needed before they are adaptable for use in the detection of infectious diseases. Elsewhere, magnetic nanotags also represent a promising alternative to fluorescent labels in biomolecular detection assays. Magnetic nanosensor technology is matrix insensitive and an innovative and highly sensitive approach that can be used for multiplexing. With the evolution of nanotechnologies and our increasing understanding of the universe of the infinitesimal small, the field of possibilities is endless. Applying these new technologies to the detection of blood\u2010transmissible agents will require the collaboration of physicists, engineers, chemists, biochemists, and biologists. Considering the complexity of biologic fluids, all emerging innovative principles should be rigorously tested in the medium to be analyzed. While the miniaturization of the screening of transmissible agents represents a difficult challenge, the identified benefits should be enough to motivate all players concerned.",
