Viruses, as small infectious agents, can infect all types of life forms (Koonin et al.2006). Due to rapid evolution and diverse viral transmission strategies, viruses are still serious threats to animal health and economy (Peiris et al.2003; Meyer and Wilke 2015; Ge et al.2018; Zhou et al.2018). Traditionally, editing in viral genome is based on spontaneous homologous recombination in host mammalian cells, or through lambda Red-mediated recombination at bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) level in Escherichia coli (E. coli) (Adler et al.2000), both of which are laborious. Therefore, efficient genome editing technologies in viral genome are still desired.",

The obstacles include: (1) CRISPR/Cas9 system performed far from perfect when Cas9 protein meets rapidly increasing number of replicated viral genome DNAs; (2) manipulation in some genes could lower the replication rate of recombinant virus, making the selection task difficult; (3) reporter genes (e.g. green fluorescence protein, GFP) are still necessary for highly efficient purification of recombinant virus, which need to be removed for further study.",

The \u201cbase editors\u201d (BEs) mediate conversion of C\u00b7G to T\u00b7A (Komor et al.2016; Ma et al.2016; Nishida et al.2016) or A\u00b7T to G\u00b7C (Gaudelli et al.2017) within target region without double strand breaks (DSBs). The technologies rely on deamination reaction catalysed by cytidine deaminase or adenosine deaminase rather than homology-dependent repair (HDR), therefore donor DNA is not required. Since developed, BEs were widely used in mammalian cells, animals and plants (Komor et al.2016; Billon et al.2017; Kim et al. 2017a; Zong et al.2017). Recent studies reported that the third generation BE (BE3) was used to induce premature stop (iSTOP) codon with high efficiency in Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and Brucella melitensis (Gu et al.2018; Zheng et al.2018).",

Recently, PRV variants emerged and caused infectious disease, posing a desperate demand for efficient viral genome editing technologies to facilitate virology study and vaccine development (Wu et al.2013). To investigate these PRV variants, several researchers have cloned PRV-BACs for use as a rapid genome editing platform (Smith and Enquist 2000; Peng et al.2009; Wang J et al. 2016, Wang et al. 2018).

We cloned PRV-Ea genome into BAC, and manipulated viral genes in E. coli cells. The induced premature mutagenesis in US8 and UL34 showed absolutely high efficiency (100%). The US8 mutant virus was generated through reverse genetic technology and represent attenuation in intercellular transmission, which is consistent with gene function. In addition, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis was performed to gain insight into distribution of iSTOPs in PRV variants. Taken together, our study provided a rapid and efficient approach to perform base-editing in viral genome at BAC level, which will facilitate study on virology.",

The transfer vector pMD18-T-US9-US2-pHA2 was constructed, linearized and co-transfected with PRV-Ea genome DNA into PK-15 cells, which was followed by plaque purification to obtain PRV-BAC recombinant virus. At the early infection phase, the self-cyclized PRV-BAC genome was isolated and transformed into E. coli DH10B competent cells, resulting in plasmid formed viral genome DNA (pPRV-BAC). Obviously, it is convenient to manipulate genes at plasmid level. Moreover, the F-plasmid vector was flanked by two same orientated loxP sites, thus making it simple to remove F-plasmid vector through Cre-mediated recombination (Sternberg et al.1981) (Fig. 1A). The pPRV-BAC plasmid, wild type PRV, F-plasmid vector integrated mutant (PRV-BAC) and rescued PRV mutant (rPRV) were validated through RFLP assay with BamH I (Fig. 1B). Theoretically, the target genes in pPRV-BAC could be easily edited using CRISPR guided base-editing system in prokaryotic cells (Gu et al.2018).

After base-editing in E. coli, five colonies were cultured, harvested and taken for plasmid isolation. The US8 fragment was PCR amplified and sequenced. The Sanger sequencing results showed that all detected colonies possessed expected mutagenesis (Fig. 2A). The 46th Gln (TGG) codon was converted into iSTOP (TAA) codon, resulting in a truncated gE protein. The mutant PRV-BAC plasmid was extracted and transfected into PK-15 cells, to achieve gE truncation virus (PRV-TgE). The morphology assay showed that truncation of gE significantly suppressed PRV virus intercellular transmission, thus leading to smaller plaque size (Fig. 2B, 2C). Growth kinetic studies for PRV-TgE showed that gE is involved in virus spread between cells, but is nonessential for virus replication (Fig. 2D). The genetic stability of PRV-TgE was analyzed by passaging and Sanger sequencing. The results showed that the iSTOP mutation was stable within 10 passages (Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, we performed induced STOP at 39th and 83rd codon sites in UL34 gene that encodes 261 aa-long protein (Fig. 3A). For each site, five colonies were taken for PCR and sequencing. The editing frequencies in both designed sites were 100%. Besides the desired base conversion, synonymous mutations were carried out at the 38th, 81st, and 82nd codons (Fig. 3B). The typical editing window is position 4\u20138 of guide RNA target sequence (counting the end distal to PAM as position 1) in eukaryotic cells (Komor et al. 2016), whereas it could be position 2\u201311 in some target sites in prokaryotic cells (Zheng et al.2018).

            "text": "Next, we performed comprehensive bioinformatic analysis to gain overall insights into targetable induced stop (iSTOP) codons of PRV-Ea genome. Besides original Cas9 formed BE3, a series BE systems were developed based on diverse CRIPSR-associated proteins, which recognized deviant PAM (Kim et al. 2017b; Li et al.2018). These BE variants include VQE-BE3, EQR-BE3, VRER-BE3, SaBE3, SaKKH-BE3 and Cpf1-BE, which recognize NGAN, NGAG, NGCG, NNGRRT, NNNRRT and TTTN, respectively (Kim et al. 2017b; Li et al.2018). Due to high GC content of herpesvirus genome, the Cpf1-BE preferring T-rich PAM was not taken for iSTOP codon analysis. A total of 68 ORFs were taken for iSTOP targeting scanning. Almost all ORFs (62/68) contain at least one iSTOP codon candidate (Supplementary Table S2). Among iSTOP codon candidates, 66% of candidates are located within first 20% in ORFs (Fig. 4A). About 40% (658/1643) of possibly iSTOP codons (CAA|Gln, CAG|Gln, CGA|Arg, and TGG|Trp) are targetable. The dominant potent iSTOP codons are CAGs, more than half (543/827) of which are targetable (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S3). Since rAPOBEC1, cytidine deaminase used in BE3 system, shows substrate bias TC \u2265 CC \u2265 AC \u2265 GC in vitro (Komor et al.2016), we analyzed upstream base of C. The pie chart in Fig. 4B shows that 44.1% of substrates are TC and CC, indicating they are preferred and would be edited with high efficiency. In addition, CDA1-BE3 and AID-BE3, formed by cytidine deaminase homologs of rAPOBEC1, shows higher editing efficiencies over BE3 for AC and GC substrates (Komor et al.2017). This information provides a guide for BE system selection for highly efficient editing.",

Because the editing is based on highly efficient base conversion mediated by CRISPR-guided cytidine deamination at plasmid, it is virus species-independent.

            "text": "In previous studies, researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 system to facilitate viral gene editing. It revealed that cleavage in viral genome caused by Cas9 protein could significantly increase recombination frequency, thus improving editing efficiency (Xu et al.2015; Yuan et al.2015; Liang et al.2016). Viral genome rapidly replicates in host cells, making it difficult to manipulate viral genes using CRISPR/Cas9 system in high copy number genomes. Therefore, it is essential to select appropriate method. For example, it was too difficult to isolate recombinant viruses using transfection followed by infection method. Co-transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 expression plasmid and PRV genome resulted in higher recombination rate and made it possible to obtained recombination virus (Xu et al.2015). On the other hand, it is essential to avoid wild type virus contamination during isolation process due to viruses spread and infect cells easily. The flowcytometry based on fluorescence reporter gene simplified and facilitated isolation of recombination virus (Liang et al.2016). Bacterial artificial chromosome method has been employed to simplify genome editing procedure, which significantly improved the recombination rate (Adler et al.2000; Almaz\u00e1n et al.2008; Liu et al.2008; Zou et al.2014; Feng et al.2015; Zou et al.2015; Richards et al.2016; Close et al.2017). Besides lambda Red mediated recombination (Liu et al.2008), the CRISPR-guided base-editing method provided an alternative approach for viral gene editing on BAC platform. Our strategy could directly edit nucleotide at target loci without donor DNA and achieve absolutely high editing rate with appropriate manner. In addition, base-editing performs at BAC DNA level, indicating that the CRISPR-guided base-editing system is virus species-independent and plaque purification of mutant virus is not required. Our results showed that PRV-TgE mutant was stable at least 10 passages, indicating that this method might be utilized for the development of attenuated live vaccines. Previous studies demonstrated that PRV deletion mutants lacking pUL34 produced infectious progeny at 3- to 4-log-reduced titer compared to wild-type PRV (Klupp et al.2000, 2007; Fuchs et al.2002). Currently, we do not have UL34-expressing cell line to rescue PRV UL34 mutant. We transfected PK-15 cells with plasmid pPRV BAC harboring UL34 point mutations for three times, but failed to achieve PRV UL34 mutant. Thus, we did not analyse the plaque size and growth kinetics. Of notice, not all viral genomes have been or can be cloned as infectious plasmids. Whether the base-editing systems can be readapted for direct targeting of DNA viruses during their replication in eukaryotic cells remains to be investigated.",
