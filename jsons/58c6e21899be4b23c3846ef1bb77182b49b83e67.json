To begin, Moody's Investors Service, a bond credit rating agency, changed its financial outlook for notfor-profit and public hospitals in the United States from stable to negative in mid-March 2020. 5 This is a strong signal from the financial investment community about their concern about the financial stability of the health care sector in these turbulent times. Their justification is based on the following: (1) likelihood of lower cash flows in the health care sector because of reductions in profitable services in preparation for surges of COVID-19 cases, (2) increased expenses in the health care sector because of higher staffing costs and supply needs, (3) lack of an inpatient diagnostic-related group for COVID-19, and (4) greater use of expensive ICU care. Further, the value of hospital investment portfolios will decline, and rising unemployment rates will result in loss of health benefits for patients. Moody's reassured the bond investment community that the majority of hospitals will withstand the COVID-19 disruption, and those with strong operating cash flow margins and sufficient days cash on hand will fare better than those that don't have these characteristics. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act just passed by Congress directly addresses many of the short-term issues raised by Moody's. 6 As the pandemic wears on, will the financial support provided to hospitals by the CARES Act-including to AMCs-be sufficient to sustain the nation's health care system through the crisis?",

Significant difficulties were experienced in the 1980s when the prospective payment system was implemented, and later in the 1990s when the reduction in Medicare payment calculations and caps on graduate medical education (GME) residency slots enacted by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 collided with the onslaught of managed care. 7, 8 AMCs achieved modest positive operating margins, however, through favorable payment rates negotiated with private health plans that wanted AMCs to be in their networks. 3 Positive financial performance enabled many AMCs to make significant investments in expanding clinical programs and facility infrastructure through the issuance of debt beginning in the early to mid-2000s. 9 This began when Medicare fee-for-service payments were roughly equal to hospital costs and accelerated after the 2008-2009 Great Recession secondary to favorable U.S. monetary policy that kept borrowing costs low. 10, 11 Before the COVID-19 crisis, some experts began to worry that a \"Medicare for All\"",
