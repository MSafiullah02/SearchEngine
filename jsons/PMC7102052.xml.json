Their relevant demographic and clinicopathologic features were shown in Table 1. T-LGL leukemia was the primary hematologic disease in 20 patients. In two patients, T-LGL leukemia developed after an antecedent blood disorder. In case 15, T-LGL leukemia of donor cell origin developed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia [7]. In case 16, T-LGL leukemia presented 2 years after successful treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. The most frequent presenting feature was anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL; 17/22 cases, 77%). Marrow examination showed pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in 15 cases (68%). No patient had a previous history of use of erythropoietin. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1.5 \u00d7 109/L) was found in eight cases (36%) and none of the patients presented with infections. Granulocyte colony stimulation factor was not used in any of the cases, so that the low frequency of neutropenia was genuine. LGL lymphocytosis (>2 \u00d7 109/L) was found in 14 cases (64%). No patient presented with autoimmune phenomena at the time of diagnosis. Case 3 was the only patient who presented with an aggressive course, characterized by fever, organ infiltration, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. All other patients pursued an indolent clinical course predominated by transfusion-dependent anemia.\n\n",

Therefore, if Asian patients had been included in Western studies, they would have been the minority. Because of the small number of Asian patients reported in the literature, we elected to include even single case reports in this study so that a reasonable number of patients could be reviewed. A selection bias toward including T-LGL leukemia patients with complications might therefore be introduced. With these limitations, our study still showed a number of interesting observations.",

However, when patients present with anemia without obvious LGL lymphocytosis, T-LGL leukemia may not be immediately obvious. We routinely performed flow cytometry and analysis for TCR gene rearrangement for patients presenting with unexplained cytopenia(s), which enabled us to detect more subtle cases of T-LGL leukemia. In studies where routine investigation for clonal TCR gene rearrangement was not performed, the diagnosis of T-LGL leukemia would understandably be based on LGL lymphocytosis.

With recognition of the importance of PRCA as a cause of anemia in T-LGL leukemia, increasing numbers of cases were reported worldwide. By 2001, PRCA has been established as a consistent albeit infrequent complication of T-LGL leukemia in Western patients [38]. In fact, T-LGL leukemia is now regarded to surpass all other pathologies as the commonest cause of PRCA [3, 38]. The high frequency of PRCA in our cases (68%) and other Asian patients (42%) is in sharp contrast to the very low frequency of PRCA at 4% in the Western patients reviewed here. The rarity of PRCA was not due to under-reporting, as in a recent Western series where this complication was purposefully looked for, the incidence was only 7% (15/203 cases) [38].",

Although the cause of neutropenia in T-LGL leukemia remains obscure, it has been postulated that LGL leukemic cells expressed FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 [39]. TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 up-regulated Fas expression on myeloid progenitors, which were then induced into apoptosis by the FasL-expressing LGL leukemic cells [39]. Interestingly, these mechanisms overlap with those involved in the neutropenia typically found in rheumatoid arthritis complicated by Felty syndrome. In the latter disease, humoral mediated mechanisms also contribute to shortened neutrophil survival. The shared mechanisms of neutrophil suppression in T-LGL leukemia and Felty syndrome have led to the premise that both disorders might be part of the spectrum of a similar disease process [39]. This proposition may explain the frequent association between T-LGL leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis in Western patients.",

T-LGL leukemia has been proposed to arise from chronic activation of T cells due to endogenous or exogenous antigens [40, 41]. The chronic antigenic stimulation then leads to extreme expansion of a clone of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells [42]. Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases might provide the antigenic stimuli in Western patients [43]. In Asian patients, however, PRCA is the most common complication. LGL leukemic cells with cytotoxic activity against red cell precursors has been postulated to occur in Asian patients [44]. Therefore, it is conceivable that in Asian patients, antigenic stimuli related to erythropoiesis could be involved in T-LGL leukemia associated with PRCA. It is interesting to note that in Western T-LGL leukemia patients, PRCA and rheumatoid arthritis/neutropenia have been observed to be mutually exclusive, again suggesting that they involve different pathogenetic mechanisms [38].",

We have previously reported that the purine analogue fludarabine together with mitoxantrone and dexamethasone resulted in high remission rates in Chinese T-LGL leukemia patients [9]. Updated results presented here showed that complete remission was maintained in five of 13 fludarabine-treated patients for a median follow-up exceeding 4 years. The advantages of this approach include a finite duration of treatment and the obviation of maintenance therapy. Fludarabine was combined with mitoxantrone and dexamethasone as it is less active as a single agent than in combination regimens. Furthermore, fludarabine as a single agent had been reported to only improve the cytopenias in T-LGL leukemia without eradicating the leukemic clone [46] and fludarabine combined with cyclophosphamide only induced partial remissions in Western T-LGL leukemia patients [32]. Fludarabine combination regimens offers the possibility of a durable remission without maintenance, as opposed to the daunting prospect of indefinite treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and cyclosporine.",
