These results are used as input into the general three-compartment linear elimination framework [1], which uses the volumes and clearances to determine the value of several intermediate variables. Depending on the method of delivery and administration procedure chosen, these intermediate variables determine the overall concentration of propofol in the blood. The performance of the PK model has been shown to be acceptable for clinical usage [2] .",
