After five days of piperacillin-tazobactam, intravenous meropenem 1 gram three times a day was started as his liver function tests had not yet stabilised and there was concern that the piperacillin-tazobactam may have been contributing to this.

Liver function tests worsened over the first five days, with alanine aminotransferase peaking at 771u/l, but reduced thereafter. Once his ferritin had fallen to less than 1000ug/l, on day nine, Anakinra was discontinued. The patient was kept in hospital for a further three days to ensure that his ferritin continued to decrease following treatment. He was discharged on day 11 feeling fit and well, with a ferritin of 766ug/l and almost normal clotting and liver function tests. Outpatient follow up was arranged to allow for clinical and biochemical review.",

We know that the viral load of patients with Covid-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness [4,5], however patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10-14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events. We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in Covid-19 infection, and we understand a clinical trial is indeed in progress [6].",
