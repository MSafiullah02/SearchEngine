Why is this the case? Using data on travel satisfaction from 4134 commutes to a large University campus in Dublin, Ireland, this paper replicates the differences in travel satisfaction between active and motorized travel. We attribute these differences in large part to the duration of the trip. Subjective trip characteristics, such as safety and convenience, also play important roles. The trip duration explains rush-hour effects as well as why people starting from less affluent and more difficult-to-reach places are less satisfied with their trips. Longer-term policy options suggested by these results include infrastructure developments and spatial development strategies. A shorter-term initiative would be to delay university schedules in the morning to avoid low travel satisfaction during the slow rush-hour period and simultaneously ease pressure on the transport network at peak times. (L.K. Lades). 1 Of course, in many cases people are not able to decide whether to live close or far away from their workplaces as this is determined by, for example, budget constraints. Travel choices are often influenced by other, longer-term choices regarding, for example, lifestyle and residential location. 2 The terms \"welfare\" and well-being are often used interchangeably in the literature on welfare economics.

            "text": "People do not always make choices that are in their own best interests. A large and growing literature in behavioral economics has identified and explored this discrepancy between decision utility (which informs choice) and experienced utility (which is the basis for welfare) (Benjamin et al., 2012; Berridge and Aldridge, 2008; Comerford, 2011; De Vos et al., 2016; Kahneman et al., 1997; Read, 2007) . For example, some people live far away from their workplaces and yet travel to work by car and public transport despite happiness research indicating that long commutes in motorized modes are one of the least satisfying daily activities (Kahneman et al., 2004; Lanc\u00e9e et al., 2017; Stone and Schneider, 2016) . Furthermore, these low levels of travel satisfaction can spill over to low levels of life satisfaction (De Vos, 2019a; Friman et al., 2017; Olsson et al., 2013; Stutzer and Frey, 2008) . 1 Such findings suggest that choices (e.g. about transportation modes) alone offer only a limited perspective to fully understand the welfare consequences of our behavior (Hausman, 2012; Infante et al., 2016; Sugden, 2018) . Hence, policy-makers who are interested in increasing people's welfare when traveling need additional information to better inform transport policy design. 2 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2020.04.007 Received 7 August 2019; Received in revised form 4 February 2020; Accepted 8 April 2020",

            "text": "Over the last decade, a growing group of scholars, including transportation researchers, have argued that subjective well-being can be used as a welfare measure to inform policy (Dolan and White, 2007; Friman et al., 2018; Layard, 2006) . Subjective well-being is often defined as an experienced momentary feeling, and diary studies or other naturalistic monitoring tools are used to measure it (Kahneman et al., 2004; Shiffman et al., 2008) . Arguably the most common finding from the literature on experienced subjective well-being in the transport context is that people who travel actively (i.e., who walk or cycle) are more satisfied with their travel than people who drive and/or use public transport (De Vos, 2018 , 2019b De Vos et al., 2013; Ettema et al., 2011; Friman et al., 2017; Lanc\u00e9e et al., 2017; Smith, 2017; Westman et al., 2017) . However, it is not yet clear why this is the case. For example, De Vos (2019b) reviews the literature on differences in travel satisfaction across travel modes and notes that \"studies on travel satisfaction barely give explanations for these differences; and when they do, these explanations are not empirically founded and therefore not entirely convincing\" (p. 15).",

Thereafter we aim to explain the differences in travel satisfaction across travel modes by empirically investigating the effects of starting time of travel, duration of travel, distance of travel, subjectively assessed characteristics of the trip, social interaction during travel, and demographic variables. We also test whether living close to bus stops, using a realtime information app about bus departures, and parking difficulties on campus are associated with travel satisfaction. Finally, we test for associations between travel satisfaction and geospatial information on the location from which participants started their trip, focusing on economic deprivation and the accessibility to transport at that location.",

The most common is the Satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS) introduced by Ettema et al. (2011). 4 The STS consists of nine question items that allow answers on a scale from \u22123 to 3 with a higher score implying higher satisfaction (De Vos et al., 2015; Friman et al., 2013) . The STS measures three sub-components of travel satisfaction with three questions each. The first two sub-components deal with affect and differentiate between valence and activation as suggested by the Swedish Core Affect Scale (SCAS) (V\u00e4stfj\u00e4ll et al., 2002) . They measure feelings from negative activation to positive deactivation (\"stressed to calm\", \"worried to confident\", and \"hurried to relaxed\") and from negative deactivation to positive activation (\"bored to enthusiastic\", \"tired to alert\", and \"fed up to engaged\"). The third subcomponent is cognitive evaluation, which is measured by the following three items: \"the trip was the worst/best I can think of\"; \"the trip was very low/high standard\"; and \"the trip did not work out/worked out well\".",

Mokhtarian et al. (2015) find that urban residents consider trips less tiring, but also less pleasant compared to non-urban residents. Other studies do not find direct associations between the residential location and travel satisfaction (Mokhtarian and Pendyala, 2018; Ye and Titheridge, 2017) . In a sample of walkers, Manaugh and El-Geneidy (2013) do not find associations between travel satisfaction, distance, and elevation change.

Commuters who use the car tend to arrive early on campus in order to find a free parking spot. Moreover, levels of congestion in the city are high, and a report suggests that only in Bogota and Rome do commuters lose more time in congestion. 7 Commuting to the campus by bike is sometimes perceived as unsafe and inconvenient because bike lanes are shared with buses for long stretches of road or end somewhat abruptly. Commuting to the campus on foot is possible for those living close to the campus as footpaths are provided in all built-up areas. In terms of public transport, the bus network is described as discontinuous and the attractiveness of bus journeys is reduced by delays caused by a small number of choke points across the road network (NTA, 2016).",

Almost half (48.69%) of the participants indicated that they regularly use a mobile phone app that provides real-time information about bus departures, and 41.94% of the participants indicated that they lived less than 500 m away from a bus stop. Of the 1381 participants who indicated that they drove regularly to the campus, 27.15% indicated rarely or never having problems finding a parking place, 30.70% answered with 1-2 times per week, 19.12% with 3-4 times per week, and 23.03% with 5 or more times per week. Participants also indicated the origin point of their trip using a list of regions that could be accessed from a drop-down menu. Respondents started their trips from 259 different regions with 221 (5.35%) starting from the Campus itself. We mapped all of these regions to the nearest Local Election Area (LEA) in order to produce Fig. 3 . 8 The numbers in each LEA in this figure indicate the number of participants who started their trip from the respective area along with the travel mode share in percent for public transport, car use, and active transport. The figure shows, for example, that active commutes are much more prevalent from LEAs L. K. Lades, et al. Transportation Research Part A 136 (2020) 318-333 close to the campus than from LEAs far away from the campus. The color-coding in the figure indicates the average travel satisfaction rating for each LEA, using a 5-point color-coded classification from red, indicating lower levels of travel satisfaction, to green, indicating higher levels of travel satisfaction. The map suggests that the distance to UCD is an important geographical determinant of travel satisfaction. However, it is possible that distance only predicts lower travel satisfaction because distance and duration are positively correlated. Moreover, there seems to be a North/South divide with commutes that start in LEAs north of the river Liffey being less satisfying than commutes from south of the river. There are recognized differences in affluence between the south and the north of the city (e.g., Doherty et al., 2015) and prior research has investigated the link between economic deprivation and travel satisfaction (e.g., Currie et al., 2009) . The accessibility to public transport may be an important reason for this link between economic deprivation and travel satisfaction. In order to investigate the impact of deprivation and accessibility on travel satisfaction in Dublin, we referred to two complementary geospatial datasets: (i) the 2016 Haase-Pratschke (HP) Index of Relative Deprivation described in Haase et al. (2012) and available online, 9 and (ii) the 2008 Accessibility Index (Gamma and Haase, 2008) . The former measures the relative deprivation of Ireland's regions based on economic, demographic, and social Census-based indicators and the latter focuses purely on transport-based accessibility indicators. Both datasets are available at Electoral Division Level, which is more detailed than the level of LEAs. 10 Hence, we linked the survey participants' points of journey origin also to the Electoral Division Level.",

For walking and biking, adding trip duration reduces predicted travel satisfaction ratings to 0.553 (95% CIs: 0.446, 0.661) and 0.416 (95% CIs: 0.330, 0.503), respectively. For the train and the bus, travel satisfaction increases to 0.336 (95% CIs: 0.190, 0.482) and 0.031(95% CIs: \u22120.035, 0.097), respectively. The reason for these changes is that active travel tends to be relatively short and public transport trips tend to be long (see Fig. 3 ) and that travel duration itself is a strong and significant predictor of trip satisfaction overall (see Table 3 , model 2). For example, based on model 2, the predicted travel satisfaction for trips lasting less than 15 min is 0.715 (95% CIs: 0.616, 0.814) and the predicted travel satisfaction for trips lasting more than an hour is \u22120.488 (95% CIs: \u22120.568, \u22120.408). 13 Once the differences in travel duration are controlled for, active travel is less good and public transport is less bad, suggesting that one main advantage of active travel is its short duration and that one main disadvantage of public transport is its long duration.",

This suggests that trips become longer when people travel later, most likely due to rush-hour effects. Fig. 5 summarizes a more detailed analysis of these time of the day effects showing the effect of time of the day (in 15-minute intervals) on travel satisfaction for active modes (walking and biking), driving the car, and public transport (bus and train). Panel A shows that time of the day is positively associated with travel satisfaction for inactive travel-modes (the car and public transport) when not controlling Table 3 with 95% Confidence Intervals. 12 The predicted travel satisfaction ratings from model (1), i.e. the black diamonds in Fig. 4 , are very similar to the average travel satisfaction ratings as presented in Table 2 . This indicates that the control variables included in model (1) are not strong determinants of the association between travel mode and travel satisfaction. 13 We can also predict travel satisfaction by trip duration in a model without controlling for travel modes. When dropping the travel mode from model 2, travel duration becomes a slightly stronger predictor of travel satisfaction: For example, the predicted travel satisfaction for trips lasting less than 15 min is then 0.887 (95% CIs: 0.801, 0.973) and the predicted travel satisfaction for trips lasting more than an hour is \u22120.581 (95% CIs: \u22120.652, \u22120.509).",

First, it replicates several associations with travel satisfaction in a different travel environment with a comparatively large sample of over 4000 participants in a city with a less Fig. 7 . Travel satisfaction by deprivation index (Panel A) and Accessibility index (Panel B) measured at the Electoral Division level at the place where the trip began. L.K. Lades, et al. Transportation Research Part A 136 (2020) 318-333 developed transport infrastructure. In our data, travel satisfaction has a mean of 0.165 (on the Satisfaction with Travel Scale that ranges from \u22123 to +3), which is comparatively low compared to other studies using the same scale in different geographical areas (e.g., compared to De Vos et al., 2015; Friman et al., 2013 Friman et al., , 2017 . 14 The study replicates recent findings indicating that travel satisfaction is highest for active transport modes (e.g., De Vos, 2018 , 2019b De Vos et al., 2013; Ettema et al., 2011; Friman et al., 2017; Lanc\u00e9e et al., 2017; Smith, 2017; Ye and Titheridge, 2017; Zhu and Fan, 2018) . Going beyond showing these associations, our study empirically investigates why travel satisfaction differs across travel modes. As highlighted by De Vos (2019b), \"no study up till now has been able to indicate why travel satisfaction levels differ according to the chosen travel mode\" (p. 15). He argues that the strong effects of travel mode on travel satisfaction typically found in the literature are likely to be overestimated. We show, for example, that the duration of the trip explains why people prefer car trips over public transport trips: If both trip types had the same duration, people would prefer using public transport in our sample. Our findings thus suggest that it is essential for future studies to control for trip duration when examining differences in travel satisfaction across travel modes. While De Vos (2019b) suggests that attitudes towards travel modes mediate the mode effect on travel satisfaction, we show empirically that trip duration is also an important mediator. However, travel mode remains a significant predictor of travel satisfaction in our data even after controlling for many variables (such as the duration of the trip). But if we had also controlled for (unavailable) data on people's attitudes towards travel modes, the travel mode effects on travel satisfaction might be even more attenuated.",

As can be seen in Fig. 3 , in our data commutes from suburban areas are less satisfying than commutes from urban areas. However, once we controlled for various variables, including duration of the commute, this effect reversed. This suggests that the inclusion of duration-related variables in the regression models might explain the differences found across studies in the previous literature. We also incorporate more specific geospatial determinants of the commutespecifically the economic deprivation and accessibility of the location where the trip started and present some associations of these variables with travel satisfaction. Hence, we contribute to the literature on the links between transportation and social disadvantage (e.g., Lucas, 2012) by directly investigating the relationship between the spatial distribution of deprivation and travel satisfaction.",

An important characteristic of most active commutes is their short duration, which is often linked to the proximity between the origin and the destination. Whilst long-term strategies can seek to reduce commute distances through higher density planning and so forth, 15 in the short to medium term, this is not an option. However, reducing 14 For example, using the same scale Friman et al. (2013) report a mean travel satisfaction rating of 0.75 in a sample from Stockholm, Goteborg, and Malm\u00f6, De Vos et al. (2015) report mean travel satisfaction ratings in Ghent by travel mode that can be averaged to a travel satisfaction rating of 1.23, and Friman et al. (2017) report the three sub-components of the satisfaction with travel scale that average to 0.87 in a sample in Stockholm, Goteborg, and Karlstad. However, our sample contains more bus users than most of the other studies which reduces the average trip satisfaction. An optimal study design would compare the travel satisfaction to very similar destinations (e.g., in terms of location) across different cities. 15 See for example the compact development concept in the National Planning Framework, as well as details of linked national infrastructure distance is not the only way to reduce trip durations. For example, the National Transport Authority of Ireland is proposing to redesign the Dublin bus network over the coming years to make bus journeys faster, more predictable, and more reliable. 16 Where these investments and actions can shorten trip durations, there should be a further stimulus for modal shift to active and mass transit modes. However, the findings of this paper also suggest that it may be useful to establish a general ambition for the reduction of trip journey times within a reasonable radius to less than 45 min, on the basis of this representing a clear threshold point for trip satisfaction ratings. 17 Third, the analysis indicates convenience as a key characteristic of travel satisfaction, suggesting that transport policies should aim to increase convenience for travelers. This can include efforts to reduce waiting times for mass transit modes, facilitating easier and more direct access to the campus via walking and cycling routes and so forth.",

This reinforces the importance of parking policy and strategy with regard to encouraging modal shift and influencing private car journeys to campus. Whilst the immediate response may be to consider the provision of additional parking spaces, the lower relative travel satisfaction of car journeys where parking is either scarce or strategically priced also represents an opportunity to stimulate additional transfers to non-motorized or mass transit modes of travel to campus.",

This insight and the overall findings in this paper lead us to consider an ambitious short-term initiative that could reduce journey times for commuters to the campus, ease pressure on the morning peak transport and travel infrastructure, and potentially encourage more non-motorized and mass transit mode choices. Specifically, we would recommend that the universities consider the introduction of a newly regulated schedule that ensures classes, coursework, and most meetings do not commence before 10 am. The anticipated impact of shifting more than 30,000 staff and students to a deferred starting hour would be to reduce associated commutes during the peak travel times. Related initiatives, compatible with the systems and skillsets developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, could also see increased options into the future for remote participation in meetings and classes. These measures could contribute to reduced road congestion and potentially increased safety for cyclists and pedestrians. The reduced commuting on public transport in the busiest period of the morning, would ease pressure on public transport service capacity and open up opportunities for other commuters (e.g. 9-5 city center workers) to consider a shift to public transport. There are of course recognizable challenges that range from motorists continuing to travel early to secure parking spaces, to challenges for the campus population relating to their own personal scheduling of commitments and activities such as picking up children, doing groceries, going to leisure activities, etc. However, an initial response may suggest complementary parking strategies, and a recognition that young university students are likely amongst the most flexible of all morning commuters. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a global understanding of what is possible in regard to remote working and learning. While a more detailed analysis of these policy proposals would need to be conducted, our results provide an important contribution to such analyses.",

For example, the finding that people are more satisfied with active than passive travel could reflect that people who are generally more satisfied with things are particularly likely to use active travel modes. Moreover, other, unobserved variables could explain both travel mode choice and travel satisfaction. Further research is needed in order to identify the direction of causality by either including travel satisfaction questionnaires in experimental designs, evaluating natural experiments, or making use of econometric techniques to allow us to infer causality from observational data. As a first step, it would be helpful to have the same study respondent rate a higher number of trips made with different travel modes in order to control for individualspecific fixed effects. Such studies are more burdensome for participants to complete, and as a result, they will likely have smaller sample sizes. Nonetheless, we believe that it is an important step for research in this area that could also identify further associations with travel satisfaction, such as weather and the time of the year.",

To get first insights into this link, future research could test for differences in travel satisfaction between active commuters who just started commuting actively and those who already commute actively for an extended period of time. More psychological variables, such as (perceived) lack of control, might also explain differences on travel satisfaction across travel modes where active travelers perceive a higher sense of control (Beir\u00e3o and Sarsfield Cabral, 2007) . Finally, variables related to the environment (such as air quality, noise, and green spaces) might explain differences in travel satisfaction across travel modes.",

Transportation Research Part A 136 (2020) 318-333 subjective trip characteristics, such as \"safe\" and \"congested\" are interpreted differently by travelers using different modes. Experiencing a busy pathway on the bike might be a different experience compared to commuting on a congested bus. Hence, comparing subjective attribute measures across modes might be an invalid comparison and further research should identify subjective attributes that are interpreted similarly across modes to allow for valid comparisons. A related avenue for future research is to investigate whether the associations we find when using the general Satisfaction with Travel Scale are also present when we investigate the sub-components of the scale. The University campus provides us with an excellent case of substantial scale. However, the methodology could be applied more broadly, with a view to the development of a city-wide travel satisfaction index. Many national authorities run travel surveys as part of their national census and adding a question on travel satisfaction for each trip would provide valuable information that could be used to develop a dynamic index that could monitor travel satisfaction and thereby inform policy-makers of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the travel infrastructure in their city.",
