DAS181 is typical of bacterial sialidases in cleaving Sia a2-3 and Sia a2-6 linkages, and it also has a demonstrated effect against acetylated and hydroxylated forms of Sia. The potency of the compound has been enhanced by coupling the active sialidase with an amphiregulin tag, allowing a longer duration of action and minimizing spread to the systemic circulation. DAS181 is now in Phase II development for the treatment of influenza, and it has also demonstrated activity in individual cases of parainfluenza in immunosuppressed patients. Continued evaluation of the roles and activities of bacterial sialidases is required to expand the range of successful antiviral therapies targeting Sia or its derivatives.",

Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors primarily act at this step, but they play a minor role in modulating viral entry (Matrosovich et al., 2004) . The first step of viral binding often involves close contact between the viral attachment protein and host receptor. Before the development of DAS181, studies in the 1980s demonstrated that natural compounds present in serum, in particular alpha 2-macroglobulin, inhibited virus adsorption to surfaces (Hanaoka et al., 1989; . Later studies identified Sia as being the key determinant of binding for these compounds (Pritchett et al., 1987; Pritchett and Paulson, 1989 ). Lentz proposed a number of strategies to prevent cell entry by blocking the host receptor (Lentz, 1988 (Lentz, , 1990 , but these were mainly directed at developing an antibody-mediated approach, rather than receptor destruction.",

To investigate this requires an understanding of the nature of Sia, its presence in the respiratory tract and the structure and function of bacterial sialidase. Sialic acid is the term used for a family of nine-carbon monoscaccharides found in animals and certain bacteria (Chen and Varki, 2010) . They are typically found at the terminal portions of oligosaccharide chains attached to proteins and lipids to form glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively. There are over 40 naturally occurring variants of these nine-carbon keto-sugars based on a neuraminic acid (Neu) or a 2-keto-3-deoxynononic acid (Kdn) backbone (Schauer, 1973; Varki, 1997) . The discovery of neuraminic acid by Klenk and colleagues has been reviewed by Schaeur (Schauer, 1973) with the term sialic acid proposed by Blix, Gottschalk and Klenk based on the Greek word sialion (salivea) as these carbohydrates were isolated from the mucin of submaxillary glands.",

Eleven different types of sialic acid have been identified on the human erythrocyte membrane, using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Bulai et al., 2003) . GalNAc is typically present on O-glycans, and GlcNAc is normally a component of N-glycans. The binding of Sia to Gal or GalNAc requires a family of enzymes called sialyltransferases (ST), with each ST producing a specific linkage (Harduin-Lepers et al., 2005; Paulson and Rademacher, 2009; Xia et al., 2005) . In some instances, multiple Sia may be linked together to form polysialic acid, most commonly in a a2-8 configuration (Hildebrandt et al., 2010) . The linkage of Sia to the adjacent sugar is in an a configuration, which means the bond is acid-labile and is readily destroyed by enzymes known as sialidases. It should be noted that in solution, unbound Sia is mainly in the \u00df-configuration, with the C2 hydroxyl positioned axial to the ring and in equilibrium with the minor a-form (Vimr, 1994) .",

The negatively-charged glycoproteins will mutually repel each other, allowing trapping of water molecules to produce a highly viscous aqueous solution that comprises the glycocalyx of many epithelial surfaces. The importance of this shield was highlighted by Varki and Varki, who indicated that >1% of the mammalian genome encodes proteins involved in this glycosylation pathway (Lehmann et al., 2006; Varki and Varki, 2007) . The high Sia content of mucin acts as a lubricant for epithelial surfaces in the cornea, nasal mucosa, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and other tissues in contact with the environment. This mucin protects the cells against mechanical and chemical damage, such as gastric acid and digestive enzymes. The Sia content of mucin also functions as a decoy for pathogens that bind to Sia, such as respiratory viruses (Lehmann et al., 2006) . The mucin is produced by goblet cells and normally is a benefit to the host (Nicholls et al., 2007) . However, in certain diseases such as cystic fibrosis, changes in mucin composition allow increased bacterial growth and pathogenesis (Xia et al., 2005) .",

The capping of terminal galactose by Sia masks the recognition of certain oligosaccharides by the asialoglycoprotein receptor of the liver (Grewal et al., 2008) or similar receptors present on macrophages. The sialylation of compounds allows plasma macromolecules to have a longer period of time in the circulation; the number of glycosylation sites is related to biological functions (Banks, 2011; Sun et al., 2011) . Conversely, the half-life of many serum glycoproteins such as thyrotropin, erythropoietin, and follicle stimulating hormone is decreased upon desialylation. Glycosylation of proteins as a shield to prevent recognition is not limited to host factors, but is also employed by pathogens such as the influenza viruses, leading to the development of antigenic variation (Sun et al., 2011) . Finally, the presence of Sia on glycans may also modulate the immune response, through recognition by Sia-binding lectins, now known as Siglecs. The first Siglec to be identified, sialoadhesin, was found on macrophages (O'Neill et al., 2013) , but more than 10 different Siglec molecules have since been discovered (reviewed in Varki and Gagneux (2012) ).",

In the former situation, this occurs at C4 and C6-9 (Cao et al., 2009; Schauer et al., 2011) with identification of the enzyme sialate-O-acetyltransferase as a candidate recently identified (Arming et al., 2011) . Modifications of Sia are important to consider, as these changes, in particular O-acetylation, may have an effect on enzymatic cleavage by sialidases. Schauer demonstrated that the position of acetylation has an effect on sialidase activity: an O-acetyl group on C 8 reduces cleavage by 40% and at C 4 by about 80% (Schauer, 1973) . Bacteria and some viruses (notably influenza C virus and coronaviruses) have circumvented this protective mechanism through the development of esterases located in the cytosol or in lysozymes. Although influenza C virus appeared to lack sialidase activity, it was still able to agglutinate red blood cells from certain species, which led to the finding of an esterase combined with the haemagglutinin and fusion protein to form the HEF that is present on influenza C and some coronaviruses (Martin et al., 2003) .",

The tissue localization of the 9-Oacetylation variant has been investigated by the use of specific monoclonal antibodies (Argueso and Sumiyoshi, 2006) , or binding by influenza C virus or its recombinant soluble form, coupled with the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Che-FcD) (Mandal et al., 2000) . These studies showed that O-acetylation of sialic acid in humans appears localized to the suprabasal plasma membranes of cells exposed to a ''wet'' surface, such as the cornea, conjunctiva, laryngeal and vaginal epithelium. There is a variation in the degree of O-acetylation between ethnic backgrounds, depending on whether individuals are slow or fast acetylators. Apart from the sialidase from Arthrobacter urefaciens, Actinomyces viscosus and to a lesser extent the sialidase from Newcastle disease virus, other sialidases are apparently not effective at cleaving the terminal sialic acid. The O-acetylation inhibits sialidase sterically, and is not competitive. Thus, O-acetylation of mucins can protect against the action of bacterial sialidases. This O-acetlyation is conspicuous on the terminal aspect of MUC16, a glycoprotein with a long extracellular domain that prevents infection of the intact epithelium.",

Many studies by Ajit Varki and colleagues have shown a high expression of this enzyme in many animal species. Humans lack CMAH activity and the only source of Neu5Gc is from the diet. This additional oxygen is important from a sialidase point of view in that many bacterial and viral sialidases preferably cleave Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc in the a2-3 and a2-6 configuration (Davies et al., 2012) . Viral sialidases from Newcastle disease virus, fowl plague and most influenza viruses also show poor cleavage of Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac. Molecular dynamic studies suggest that there is a conformational change induced by the extra oxygen that may explain this decreased activity.",

In the case of enzymatic cleavage of Neu5Gc, this enzymatic cleavage is unlikely to be a major concern, because of the lack of CMAH enzyme in humans, and thus the mucin is exclusively Neu5Ac. However, with O-acetylation, this enzymatic cleavage may be of concern if topical therapy is to be used in regions of the body where there is a high degree of O-acetylation of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, as is present in the eye and larynx.",

As viruses replicate intracellularly, it follows logically that successful attachment to the cell requires a matching up of the receptor with the pathogen. This is often a two-step process: first, a low-affinity ''browsing'', followed by a higher-affinity interaction with the virus, and more specific receptor interactions (Helander et al., 2003) . An extensive list of viruses that utilize Sia and which may infect the respiratory tract has been reviewed by Lehmann and colleagues (Lehmann et al., 2006) . Even though influenza virus has been the most well characterized of the pathogens studied, it must be noted that other viruses, including cytomegalovirus (Taylor and Cooper, 1989) , rhinovirus 87 (Blomqvist et al., 2002) , mumps Urabe AM9 (Reyes- Leyva et al., 2007) and the paramyxoviruses all utilize Sia (Suzuki et al., 2001) (Paulson et al., 1979) , suggesting that sialidase treatment may potentially be useful for these infections.",

The syn-thesis of Sia in bacteria is limited to a few, mostly pathogenic species that incorporate Sia into surface structures, such as the capsular polysialic acid found in Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli K1 (Plumbridge and Vimr, 1999) . The Sia that is incorporated or synthesized is used as a growth factor or a source of carbon (Kim et al., 2011; Stafford et al., 2012; Vimr et al., 2004) . Bacteria that utilize Sia include Neisseria, Haemophilus, Bacteroides, Fusobacteria and Streptococci. To achieve this scavenger effect, a bacterium first require a sialidase to remove the Sia from the host environment, then enzymes for catabolism, followed by uptake into the bacterium for utilization. The latter two steps will not be elucidated further, but an excellent review on these processes is available (Vimr et al., 2004) . Another outcome of the sialylation of bacterial surfaces is similar to that mentioned above for viruses, in that they are able to avoid recognition by the host defense mechanisms, as sialylation results in recognition as ''self'' rather than ''foreign''.",

If sialidase is to be used as a prophylactic or therapeutic strategy, there have therefore been concerns that this may lead to increased bacterial adherence and secondary bacterial pneumonia (Zhang, 2008) . In reality, increased adherence is due to epithelial necrosis and exposure of the basement membranes as a result of viral-induced cell death (Plotkowski et al., 1986) , rather than surface-induced desialylation, which was not associated with epithelial cell death (Nicholls et al., 2008) .",

It is even possible for the same bacteria to have different specificities: the NanA of S. pneumonia can cleave a2-3, a2-6 or a2-8 linkages, but the extracellular NanB prefers a substrate with the a2-3 linkage. The broad range of specificities has been attributed to a number of mechanisms, including the configuration of the active site and the role of water molecules as nucleophiles. The crystal structure of NanB has been used to demonstrate a2-3 cleavage specificity, proposing that an additional rim of residues above the arginine triad may only allow an a2-3 configuration to bind (Gut et al., 2008) .",

Achieving this would require a number of properties. The first is that an effective sialidase would need to have a broad catalytic activity, because with agents such as influenza virus, binding is dependent on the linkage between the Sia and galactose. The first evidence of this in influenza was demonstrated by Rogers and Paulson, who desialylated red blood cells, then re-sialylated them using specific sialyltransferases that were either a2-3 or a2-6 linked . Avian or equine viruses agglutinated the former, while human and swine viruses agglutinated the latter. From these studies the paradigm emerged that avian viruses were primarily a2-3 binding and human and swine viruses were a2-6 binding (Wilks et al., 2012) . As ducks and waterfowl contain mainly a2-3 terminated Sia in their intestines, there would be little selection pressure for avian viruses to acquire a2-6 binding, and cross-species transmission would require a number of mutations.",

Lectin binding studies have shown that a2-6 and a2-3 N-linked sialic acids are distributed throughout the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans, with an increased distribution of a2-3 O-linked sialic acids in the lower respiratory tract (Nicholls et al., 2007) .

For instance, since erythrocytes are removed from the circulation once they are desialylated, it has been proposed that systemic sialidase treatment might result in widespread erythrophagocytosis (Biondi et al., 2002; Bratosin et al., 1998) . Furthermore, as many viral respiratory pathogens infect both the upper and lower respiratory tract, including the alveoli, the sialidase would need to be in an aerosolized or nebulized form, to allow even distribution throughout the airway. Finally, a mechanism for retention in the extracellular environment, avoiding rapid catabolism, would be advantageous for effective pharmacokinetics.",

One of its features is an epidermal-growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which is homologous with other members of the EGF-like growth factor family, meaning that it can bind to the EGF receptor present on epithelial cells. Unlike many other members of the EGF family, amphiregulin binding does not lead to EGFR degradation, but to recycling of the receptor and continued accumulation at the surface (Willmarth et al., 2009) . At the other end of the protein is a heparin-and glycosaminoglycan-binding domain, which is involved in the inhibition or transformation of this glycoprotein (hence the name amphi-regulin). In the case of DAS181, the sialidase was combined with the GAG-binding portion of human AR. By binding to the negatively-charged glycosaminoglycans on the surface of airway epithelial cells, the cationic C-terminal amphiregulin tag anchors DAS181 on the respiratory epithelium, improving its potency. This net effect of combining the sialidase with amphiregulin means that the sialidase will be targeted to epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, but without activating the EGFR pathway.",

Repeated daily exposures of inhaled DAS181 for 28 days at achieved doses of up to 3.00 mg/kg/day were well tolerated, and clinical signs were not affected by treatment with DAS181. Minimal but significant decreases in red blood cells, haematocrit and hemoglobin were identified, together with an increased reticulocyte count, in keeping with a mild anemia; systemic absorption from the respiratory tract was estimated at 2% (Larson et al., 2011) . In this study there was also a 3-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) from the liver, which was attributed to diminished clearance, owing to competition for the asialoglycoprotein receptor. The rise in ALP was not associated with any evidence of hepatotoxicity. It is thought that desialylation of the serum proteins may lead to saturation of the asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGR) in the liver and spleen, and reduced clearance of certain glycoproteins, including ALP. Further studies were done on human airway epithelial cells . In this study, a 90% desialylation effect was seen after 15 min, and the presence of mucus did not interfere with desialylation (Fig. 2) . Similar changes were also seen in freshly isolated human bronchial ex vivo cultures . In the HAE model, re-sialylation was achieved by 10 days, whereas without the amphiregulin tag re-sialylation was much faster. A 24 h postexposure regimen also produced a reduction in viral titre in H1N1 infection, thus demonstrating that DAS181 could have a therapeutic was well as a prophylactic role. This was also demonstrated in an animal model, in which treatment at 48 h postinfection reduced mortality and viral load in mice infected with A/PR8/34(H1N1) and A/Victoria/3/75(H3N2) . Additional studies were done on lung ex-vivo infections, using H5N1 H1N1pdm viruses (Triana-Baltzer et al., 2009) , showing a similar reduction in viral infection without toxicity.",

The interaction between influenza virus infection and secondary pneumonia is a complex one that has been investigated by McCullers and others (Grijalva and Griffin, 2012; Iverson et al., 2011; Karlstrom et al., 2011) . Since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, there has been an association of increased bacterial infection following influenza infection. The recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic was associated with an increase in invasive pneumococcal infection (Nelson et al., 2012) , suggesting that pneumococcal vaccination should be included as a vaccine strategy in future pandemics. Indeed, vaccination strategies using pneumococcal vaccination reduced the incidence of influenza-associated pneumonia. However, the link between influenza and pneumococcal infection has been complicated by the finding that not all pneumococcal serotypes are associated with secondary pneumonia, and that influenza virus infection may select out and favor the growth of particular serotypes (McCullers et al., 2010) . It has been proposed that the desialylation produced by the viral neuraminidase exposes receptors that allow increased binding by pneumococci, followed by invasion. As we pointed out previously, a clear distinction needs to be made between desialylation in viral infection and that induced by topical therapy (Nicholls et al., 2008) .",

Also, in a study previously cited, there was no evidence of increased adherence of pneumococci to desialylated tracheal epithelial specimens (Nicholls et al., 2008) . The contrast between changes induced by influenza virus infection and by topical desialylation can be explained by the different pathologies: influenza virus infection of an epithelial surface causes necrosis and desialylation, while the changes induced by bacterial sialidase consist only of desialylation. In a virus infection, there is acute epithelial denudation and exposure of the basement membrane, allowing adherence of S. pneumoniae. With sialidase treatment alone, because there is no cell cytotoxicity or epithelial loss, there is no increased adherence of pneumococi.

Thus, although zanamivir inhibited PIV neuraminidase activity, it did not prevent release of virus from the cell (Moscona, 2005; Porotto et al., 2001) . As the parainfluenza viruses use a2-3 and a2-6 bound Sia for attachment, infection with these viruses could be amenable to sialidase treatment. Even though most studies utilizing DAS181 have used influenza A as a target, it has also been used in patients with parainfluenza. In an experimental setting, DAS181 treatment of human parainfluenza virus-permissive cell lines and of infected cotton rats led to effective desialylation and reduced infection (Moscona et al., 2010) . DAS181 has also been used on a compassionate, emergency basis in immunocompromised patients infected with parainfluenza virus, with a beneficial effect. The first case was a 63 year old female stem cell transplant recipient who developed nasal congestion and cough, followed by clinical and radiological features of viral bronchiolitis and worsening respiratory function. She received three daily inhaled administrations of DAS181 using a dry powder inhaler, and showed improvement in clinical, radiological and pulmonary function parameters after treatment. PIV3 infection was confirmed, and there was a reduction in viral load after treatment . In another report, two immunocompromised lung or stem cell transplant recipients who developed PIV3 infection were successfully treated after developing lower respiratory tract disease. In these cases, there was a 5 day treatment with improvement in clinical symptoms and respiratory function, though changes in quantitative viral load did not match the clinical findings (Guzman-Suarez et al., 2012) . However, a more recent case of DAS181 treatment of PIV3 pneumonia in a lung transplant patient was associated with both clinical improvement and reduction in viral load (Drozd et al., 2012) .",

In the control panel (A), there is surface binding to ciliated cells and within goblet cells by the lectin Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), which binds Siaa2-6 linkages. The red color indicates the presence of Siaa2-6, which allows binding and infection by influenza viruses. In panel B the amphiregulin component of DAS181 (green polygon) binds to glycosaminoglycans present on epithelial cells, and the functional sialidase (orange circle) cleaves Sia from the surface, preventing infection by influenza viruses.",
