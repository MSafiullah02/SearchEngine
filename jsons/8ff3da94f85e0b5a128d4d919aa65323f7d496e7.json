The two most important of these are to protect the health and welfare of research mice and to prevent infections from negatively impacting research. Just as the genetic integrity of a mouse strain will influence the reproducibility and validity of research data, so too will the microbiologic integrity of the animals. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the literature of laboratory animal sciences wherein the direct impact of infections on physiologic parameters under study have been described. Therefore, it is of great importance that scientists pay close attention to the health status of their research animal colonies and maintain good communications with the animal facility personnel at their institution about mouse health issues. This overview provides information about animal health monitoring (HM) in research mouse colonies including commonly monitored agents, diagnostic methods, HM program, risk assessment, and animal facility biosecurity.

From a genetic perspective research scientists address animal quality issues by testing their mice for consistency of genetic background, and in the case of genetically engineered mutant mice (GEM), for direct evidence that specific genes of interest are present (or absent in the case of knockouts). It is prudent to do this testing prior to embarking on an expensive research project (Fahey et al., 2013) . Similarly, it is prudent to verify the health status of research mouse colonies to exclude mice compromised by infections.

The species and prevalence of the agents (viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi) established in these surveys were dependent on the geographic areas and institutions under study. Nonetheless, these data point out that despite efforts taken at many research institutions worldwide to eliminate infectious agents and elevate the health status of their animal facilities, infectious agents of mice still persist. Moreover, novel infectious agents of mice are being discovered more frequently now as genome sequencing methods become faster and less expensive. Murine astrovirus (MuAstV) is such an example. The virus was first identified in 1985 by electron microscopy following an outbreak of diarrhea in a colony of nude mice and not further characterized until 2013 by use of viral metagenomics (Kjeldsberg and Hem, 1985; Ng et al., 2013) .

The Federation of European Laboratory Science Associations (FELASA) regularly emphasizes this fact by meticulously outlining rodent HM guidelines for research animal facilities (M\u00e4hler et al., 2014) . HM programs are generally based on long-established standardized lists of target organisms (Tables 1 and  2 ) as well as recently discovered microorganisms. Yet, it is common for institutional laboratory animal veterinarians to tailor HM programs to meet their facilities' specific needs in a cost-effective manner, since the prevalence of murine pathogens varies by institution. Understanding HM programs is essential to the well-being of one's animals as well as the preservation of data integrity. For this reason, it is important, especially for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, new investigators and others with limited experience in dealing with infections in mouse colonies that they become familiar with the HM programs at their own institutional animal facilities.

A variety of factors must be taken into consideration: the types of studies being conducted, caging systems, numbers and types of mouse strains being housed, local prevalence of specific infectious agents, animal care practices, health history, facility infrastructure, presence of non-murine animal models, and available funding.

Viral infections of mice are the greatest concern to laboratory animal veterinarians and animal facility personnel because of their potential for spread across a facility, the diseases they can cause and their impact on research. There are seventeen viral species in Table 1 many of which have substrains or additional serotypes that infect mice. However, the prevalence of these viruses varies greatly, with some no longer found in research animal facilities. Some viral infections, such as murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), mouse thymic virus (MTV), murine polyomavirus (MPyV), ectromelia virus (ECTA), reovirus (REO) have declined significantly since the 1990's and have become rare or nonexistent in mouse colonies. Based on serological or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data from the past fifteen years (Weisbroth, 1999; Prichett-Corning et al., 2009; M\u00e4hler et al., 2014) , the most prevalent viral agents in contemporary mouse facilities are mouse norovirus (MNV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), mouse parvovirus (MPV), and mouse rotavirus (MRV, known as epizootic diarrhea of infant mice, EDIM). Agents such as MNV and MPV are shed in mouse feces for as long as 2 months, even by immunocompetent mice. Additionally, small non-enveloped viruses (i.e., MPV, MNV, MRV) are very resistant to chemical or environmental inactivation. In contrast, although MHV does not remain active for long periods in the environment, it is highly contagious and thus continues to be a major infectious agent in mouse facilities, especially in conventionally housed mice. It is likely that some agents may be prevalent simply because they are newly recognized (i.e, MNV, MuAstV; Kjeldsberg and Hem, 1985; Karst et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2013) .

Laboratory animal veterinarians often classify murine viruses into risk groups according to the significance of interference with research, infectivity and potential for spread and difficulties with detection and elimination. In Table 1 , a simple classification scheme of A to D is based on these criteria. Viruses in groups A and B are more likely to adversely affect research and for group A, present the risk of human infection. Viruses in group C have minimal impact on research and are not common whereas those in group D are recently discovered viruses whose impact on research is not well known. For example, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and hantavirus are at risk level A because of their zoonotic potential, that is, their ability to infect humans as well as mice. A few other viral agents, including murine adenovirus-1 (MAdV-1), ECTA, MHV polytropic strains, and Sendai virus (SV), are also classified as risk level A because they are capable of causing clinical illness in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient adult mice. Viruses at risk level B may interfere with specific experiments involving the host immune system (parvovirus, MCMV, MTV, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus [LDEV], MHV enterotropic strains), central nervous system (Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, TMEV), or gastrointestinal systems (MAdV-2, MRV).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 323, "text": "Fox et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 324, "end": 349, "text": "Percy and Barthold, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 350, "end": 373, "text": "Besselsen et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 374, "end": 394, "text": "M\u00e4hler et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 633, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Viral Infections of Mice"}, {"text": "Natural transmission of murine viruses occurs most commonly through the fecaloral route or fomites (e.g., MAdV, ECTA, MNV, MuAstV, EDIM, TMEV, MHV, REO).

This is particularly important for banked biologicals that may have been frozen before an infection was detected in the mouse from which the materials were derived, or before sufficiently sensitive tests were available for detection of the specific infectious agent. Table 2 demonstrates species of bacteria, fungi and parasites for which research mice are commonly tested. Regarding bacterial infections, the actual species of bacteria isolated from infected mice vary to a great extent depending on the genetics and phenotype, age, and immune status of the mice, as well as environmental factors such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), human traffic flow, husbandry practices (e.g., bedding type, caging system), preparation of animal supplies (sterile versus non-sterile), and human contact with mice. For example, virtually all mouse strains are susceptible to infection with opportunistic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Proteus mirabilis and Helicobacter spp. and these species are commonly found in many mouse facilities (Prichett-Corning et al., 2009; Treuting et al., 2012 ). Yet, taking certain precautions in mouse-housing facilities can substantially reduce the prevalence of opportunistic bacterial infections. This topic will be discussed below under disease prevention. The preponderance of bacterial infections of mice is non-lethal, subclinical infections. Asymptomatic mice may only be identified at the time of health monitoring when microbial cultures or PCR yield positive results.

Other factors that may contribute to the continued presence of parasites in some research colonies may include unregulated movement of mice between institutional animal facilities and a lack of proper quarantine procedures that allow for ample time for testing or treatment of imported mice. Additionally, pinworm infections may be particularly problematic due to treatment failure, persistence of eggs in the environment and diagnostic inefficiencies.

Generally speaking, research investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students are not involved in the oversight or use of biosecurity measures at this level. These are overseen by the facility management staff. Nonetheless, especially for the novice mouse user, you can discuss the building level biosecurity measures at your institution with the facility management staff to gain an understanding of the current measures in place.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prevention of Infections"}, {"text": "Mouse room level biosecurity is very critical and presents an opportunity for mouse users to participate in the protection of their animals from exposure to infectious agents. Mice are generally housed in either conventional cages with or without a filter top and placed on racks in an open room, or in individually ventilated cages (IVC), or rack and cage systems in which the cage (with or without filter) is securely attached to a specially designed rack that provides HEPA-filtered input and exhaust air with no exposure to room air. IVC caging systems are considered very secure with regard to exposure of mice to adventitious infectious agents. Though IVC caging offers greater protection of mice to inadvertent exposure to infectious agents, for both cage types, IVC and conventional, the real risks are associated with handling of mice during cage changes, experimental use, and other handling that present opportunities for exposure of mice to infectious agents. Thus, applying strict biosecurity steps at these critical junctures pays off by reducing the risk of an outbreak.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prevention of Infections"}, {"text": "What steps can help? Direct human contact with mice is inadvisable as it increases the risk of transmission of human opportunistic bacteria to the mice by exposure to human skin, breath, nasal or oral secretions. Forceps that have been treated with a disinfectant, or disinfected gloved hands should be used to pick up and handle mice. The specific combination of personal protective equipment (PPE) varies with the institution and is in most cases chosen by the animal facility and veterinary staff; however, in general, personnel that routinely work with mice should always wear gloves and a clean lab coat or scrubs. Mask, bonnet, and shoe covers or dedicated mouse room shoes should be worn in higher health status rooms. Immunodeficient and GEM mice housed in high level barrier rooms generally require more stringent PPE, such as sterilized PPE that may also include face shields or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) to further prevent inadvertent exposure of the mice to infectious agents. Additionally, sterilization of all of the materials to which mice in high barrier rooms are exposed (cages, bedding, feed and water) is performed to eliminate infectious agents that may be present in these materials. The specific PPE you use in preparation for handling mice should be discussed with your animal facility staff.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prevention of Infections"}, {"text": "Following institutional biosecurity practices is prudent, as each of the PPE items mentioned serves to reduce exposure of mice to human microflora and mouse pathogens, as humans may also serve as unintentional fomites for agents that were acquired in the environment outside of the mouse facility.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prevention of Infections"}, {"text": "Further biosecurity steps should be taken during experimental manipulation of mice and movement of animals back and forth to a laboratory, or during movement between mouse rooms. Research procedures ideally should be done in a mouse-room-associated procedure area to avoid transporting the mice out of the housing room. The procedure room and equipment should be routinely disinfected by the users to prevent the transmission of infectious agents between mice from different projects or, in the case of shared procedure rooms, between mice from different mouse rooms. In those cases in which mice are taken from a mouse room to a research laboratory for experimental manipulation, the same precautions for handling the mice in a mouse room apply to handling the mice in a laboratory. Additionally, if possible, the mice should be returned to a mouse room dedicated for the purpose of housing mice that have been in a laboratory or otherwise out of the mouse room of origin. Check with the animal facility staff at your institution to determine if such facilities are available.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prevention of Infections"}, {"text": "It is also important to be aware of institutional procedures pertaining to the movement of mice between different housing rooms. While it would be ideal for all research mouse colonies to be free of all infectious agents and to maintain them using stringent biosecurity measures, this is often not feasible in many institutions due to the high cost of maintaining such operations on a daily basis. Therefore, physical separation of mice based on health status and regulation of mouse movement and human traffic is another biosecurity measure that is employed at many institutions. For this reason, movement of mice between mouse rooms is inadvisable unless it is a controlled move sanctioned by the veterinary staff. Additionally, each mouse room may have its own environmental microflora as well as that present in the mice. For this reason, moving mice around to different rooms has the potential of altering that microflora, which is a change that could impact research results.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Prevention of Infections"}, {"text": "It is not in the purview of this article to provide an exhaustive list or discussion of biosecurity procedures. However, it is important to note that testing all biologicals used in mice (e.g., cells, antibodies, proteins, other biological molecules) for the presence of pathogens is critical for the prevention of inadvertent transmission of infectious agents. Furthermore, quarantine of newly imported mice and testing them for infections prior to release into the general population will prevent the transmission of infections potentially carried by these mice.

To achieve this goal, the animal care staff must be familiar with each investigators' research animal models and objectives. Communication between research personnel and members of the animal care staff plays a critical role in maintaining appropriate HM programs, biosecurity practices, and quarantine procedures that serve to prevent infectious outbreaks. Effective communication between research and animal care personnel ensures that the HM program and biosecurity measures employed are suitable for the types of research mice within a given mouse room and that health testing is properly performed, test results are correctly interpreted, and unforeseen events within the animal facility are promptly dealt with. When unexpected events occur, such as discovery of ill or dead animals or issues with the mouse housing room (e.g., variations in temperature, light, humidity), it is recommended that research personnel discuss the issues with the facility staff immediately to get advice and assistance in dealing with the situation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Communication between Researchers and Animal Care Staff"}, {"text": "The animal care staff can also assist new members of the scientific community in becoming familiar with the use of mice in their research.
