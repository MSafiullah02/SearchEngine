            "text": "In most commercial and residential applications, the space relative humidity is not controlled because conventional air-conditioning systems rely on operating the cold coil at very low effective temperatures to enable the removal of moisture by condensation. As such, the desired space relative humidity can only be achieved by matching the equipment (sensible heat ratio) SHR with the building SHR, but a perfect match rarely happens. This divergence leads to excessive cooling which increases energy use, and moisture problems which accelerate microbial growth, particularly for subtropical climates like Hong Kong with very humid outdoor air.",

Desiccant cooling system, which can actively control the humidity level, is often used for achieving the dehumidification objective. Recent studies on desiccant cooling system have been done on optimizing the operating variables for better energy performance [4], [5], [6], [7]; developing empirical model for investigation of the system performance [8]; improving the control and operation by experimental studies [9], [10]; and widening the application to different types of buildings [11], [12], [13], [14]. However, it is noted that they are either restricted to applications where ventilation requirements are set to remove heat generated by people, lighting and equipment, or where moisture removal is not a design intent [13], [14]. As for applications where ventilation requirements are set for moisture and contaminates removal, little has been found in extant literature.",
