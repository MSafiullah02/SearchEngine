            "text": "Extramedullary plasmacytomas (EMPs) are monoclonal proliferations of terminally differentiated B cells that do not involve the bone marrow. An uncommon neoplasm in cats, the majority of cases are cutaneous (Majzoub et al., 2003), although there are rare reports of non-cutaneous EMPs, including those of sinonasal (Sch\u00f6niger et al., 2007), gastrointestinal (Rowland and Linke, 1994, Zikes et al., 1998), cerebral (Greenberg et al., 2004), intraocular (Michau et al., 2003), lip and gingival origin (Kyriazidou et al., 1989). With the exception of the intracerebral and sinonasal cases, most EMPs are described as well-circumscribed, non-infiltrative masses (Majzoub et al., 2003, Greenberg et al., 2004, Sch\u00f6niger et al., 2007). Additionally, although primary local extracellular amyloidosis with secondary granulomatous inflammation is well-reported in plasma cell dyscrasias in animals (Rowland and Linke, 1994, Majzoub et al., 2003, Gross et al., 2005), extensive accumulation of intrahistiocytic amyloid is unusual.",

Physical examination revealed marked submandibular lymphadenopathy, but additional diagnostic tests were initially declined by the owner. The cat showed no response to empirical treatment with prednisolone and clindamycin. Cytology of an aspirate taken from the submandibular lymph nodes 1 month after initial presentation revealed predominantly macrophages, admixed with lymphocytes, plasma cells and a few neutrophils and eosinophils. The macrophages were distended with magenta-coloured material that was amorphous and curvilinear to granular. The cytology was interpreted as inflammatory, with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and increased numbers of plasma cells.",

            "text": "This case represents an extramedullary mature type plasmacytoma involving the upper and lower respiratory tract with lymph node metastasis. The patient was a geriatric male, consistent with the higher reported incidence of EMPs in older male cats (Majzoub et al., 2003, Michau et al., 2003, Greenberg et al., 2004). Although the majority of human EMPs reportedly arise within the upper respiratory tract (dos Anjos Corvo et al., 2013), this is a rare location in small animals, with only a few case reports describing primary laryngeal and tracheal EMPs in dogs, and one report involving the nasal cavity and frontal sinus of a cat (Chaffin et al., 1998, Weigt and McCracken, 2001, Hayes et al., 2007, Sch\u00f6niger et al., 2007, Witham et al., 2012). This case is unique as it describes an EMP with extensive tissue infiltration as well as metastasis. In the previously reported case of sinonasal EMP in a cat, the neoplasm was limited to the nasal cavity and frontal sinus (Sch\u00f6niger et al., 2007). In the case of an intracerebral EMP in a cat, the neoplasm was more infiltrative, involving the leptomeninges, ventricular system, subependymal tissue and the habenular nucleus (Greenberg et al., 2004). However, to our knowledge, the present case is the first report of extensive infiltration by an EMP within the upper and lower respiratory tract. Severe plasmacytic inflammation may be difficult to differentiate from a mature type plasmacytoma and initial biopsy and cytology samples from this cat were suggestive of an inflammatory process rather than neoplasia. Assimilation of necropsy findings with additional diagnostic tests allowed a diagnosis of a mature type EMP.",

In domestic animals, primary amyloidosis typically develops in cases of plasma cell dyscrasias, although not all plasma cell dyscrasias result in amyloidosis. Neoplastic plasma cell populations may produce large quantities of monoclonal, complete or fragmented immunoglobulin light or heavy chains (typically lambda light chain in animals). In some cases, these proteins are unstable and insoluble and form aggregates of amyloid fibrils that are unable to be degraded by macrophages. Secondary amyloidosis is more common in animals and occurs in some cases of chronic inflammatory disease. The increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (specifically interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1) released by activated macrophages results in increased production and release of serum amyloid-associated peptide (SAA, an acute phase protein) by hepatocytes. SAA is degraded into a smaller AA protein, which is unstable, insoluble and prone to forming fibrils (amyloid). A defect in macrophage enzymes or a mutation in the SAA protein is theorized to result in amyloid accumulation, rather than the normal degradation of this acute phase protein (Snyder, 2012).",

However, the amyloid deposits in these reports was described as predominantly extracellular (or not specified), making this the first report to describe predominantly intrahistiocytic amyloid (Arnesen and Manivel, 1993, Rowland and Linke, 1994, Ramos-Vara et al., 1998, Majzoub et al., 2003, Sharma et al., 2009).
