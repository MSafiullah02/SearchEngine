The BCoV S protein is a very large membrane glycoprotein of 1363 amino acids and is cleaved at amino acid positions 768 and 769 to form two subunits termed S1 and S2 (Yoo and Deregt, 2001). S2 is a transmembrane protein. S1 is responsible for receptor binding, haemagglutination and induction of neutralizing antibodies in the host species (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). The BCoV S1 gene shows a low level of sequence homology while the S2 subunit is highly conserved, as it is in other coronaviruses (Hasoksuz et al., 2002a). Some antigenic and biological variations have been shown in the S1 gene region especially in field strains, although BCoVs belongs to a single serotype.",

On the other hand, there are reports indicating that there are no differences between BCoVs that cause enteric and respiratory infections; these have been referred to as enteric coronaviruses (EBCoV) and respiratory coronaviruses (RBCoV), respectively (Reynolds et al., 1985; Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995). In the most recent studies, questions arose as to whether the same virus strain could be responsible for the simultaneous appearance of enteric and respiratory disease in the same animal and there was a suggestion that the mutation of the virus during infection could occur. This mutation is often in the S1 region of BCoV. Antibodies have an important role in protection against this infection. Thus, the mutations determined in this region might have an influence on the choice of vaccine strain.",

Fourteen fecal samples were positive by both ELISA and nested PCR, while two samples were positive by nested RT\u2010PCR only. In addition, the nested RT\u2010PCR revealed two (1.0%) out of 199 swab samples positive with the expected size (407 bp in length) of amplicon (Table 1). It is noted that both nasal and fecal samples from two calves (Code: An\u20108, An\u201011) were positive for BCoV RNA. BCoV was isolated from 18 samples including two nasal swab and 16 fecal samples. All samples, which produced cytopathic effect characterized by syncytium formation on HRT\u201018 cells after second or third passages were confirmed as positive for BCoV by single round RT\u2010PCR targeting the N gene (730 bp in size). Virological results and individual data of animals are shown in Table 1. The S1 gene region of BCoV could be amplified from five of the 18 feces samples and from the BCoV Mebus strain using primers (S1NS and S1NA) described by Brandao et al. (2006) (Fig. 2). The sequencing of the S1 coding regions of An\u20104 and An\u201011 isolates identified 450 and 487 nucleotides respectively (GenBank accession numbers GQ259978 and GQ259979, respectively). The S1 sequences of the isolates showed 88.2% identity. The nucleotide similarity between An\u20104 and the Mebus strain was 88.8% and 92.5% between An\u201011 and the Mebus strain. Comparison of amino acid sequences, deduced from the S1 nucleotide sequence, showed some amino acid changes between BCoVs from two herd\u2013mate calves and also between the Mebus strain and BCoVs detected in this study (Fig. 1). Phylogenetic analysis using the Neighbor Joining method revealed two local isolates (An\u20104 and An\u201011) were clustered in different groups (Fig. 2). In addition to the virological data, VNT indicated that BCoV was widespread in Turkey (Table 1), which concurs with previous studies reported in Turkey (Alkan, 1998; Alkan et al., 2003; Hasoksuz et al., 2005).",

In contrast to this, however, one of the BCoV isolates (Ka\u201055) was recovered from a 3 year\u2010old cow with diarrhea. It is known that BCoV is associated with acute diarrhea of adult cattle, referred to as winter dysentery (Athanassious et al., 1994), and also the same field strain can cause different clinical infections in cattle in different age groups (calves, heifers and adults) (Park et al., 2006; Decaro et al., 2008). In the present study, BCoV was detected from both nasal swab (n = 2) and feces samples (n = 16), consistent with previous reported by several studies (Fukutomi et al., 1999; Lathrop et al., 2000a, 2000b; Cho et al., 2001b; Hasoksuz et al., 2002b; Park et al., 2006; Kanno et al., 2009).Genetic and antigenic variation related to tissue tropism has been the subject of many studies (Chouljenko et al., 2001; Gelinas et al., 2001; Hasoksuz et al., 1999a, 2002a; Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995). In this study, BCoVs were detected from both nasal and fecal samples in two calves (An\u20108 and An\u201011) in the same herd (Herd No II) (Table 3).
