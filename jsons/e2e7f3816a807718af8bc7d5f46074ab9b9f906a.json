Many of these conferences and meetings either have either been canceled or are being held remotely, if at all. Also, social distancing measures have forbidden the old-fashioned trainee-faculty in-person teaching. A growing number of cardiology conferences around the globe are either being postponed, canceled or being conducted virtually to prevent mass gathering and heath care workers transmitting the very same virus that they are fighting against 10 . These measures have resulted in diminished learning and circumventing collaborative and networking opportunities for trainees. Similarly, research has been suspended at many institutions with core laboratory closures and institutional board review mandating to stop in-person participant visits to prevent the spread of the virus. This pandemic could disrupt the years of hard work put by physician-scientist and adversely affect grant funding for the ongoing studies. Although the educational opportunities are severely limited in this time of crisis, especially in-person mentoring, in this age of technology there are ample online educational tools and resources available to the trainees to learn and enrich themselves. In addition, with on and off rotational policy, fellows can get Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f more time to engage with their mentors remotely to confer new projects, write grants for future studies, and resume pending projects.",

During these difficult times, a physician's family is paramount to maintaining optimal mental health while facing the precariousness of COVID-19. However, due to a nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), inadequate testing, limited treatment options, and extended workloads, trainees are deeply concerned that they may contract the illness and expose their family members at home, who may be more vulnerable to the virus. This has led some physicians to distance themselves from their family and remain in a separate room or home and only see their family through the window or by video calling. As the front line providers, fellows are also succumbing to illness, with many being quarantined due to exposure to the virus or recovering from COVID-19 infections themselves.",

On the other hand, there are reports of the decline in the number of patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes in regions severely affected by the pandemic 7 . To make the situation grim, current projections predict that this trend is expected to continue for several months. Cardiology and subspecialty fellows are being actively deployed as attending physicians or fellows/resident physicians in emergency rooms, medical floors or critical care units to care for COVID-19 patients. The fellows deployed are working mostly on rotating shifts basis in line with current clinical demands, to limit virus exposure and to keep the workforce reserve. Mostly on-call fellows and attendings are managing the cardiology services in the hospital, which are limited mostly to in-patient consultation and emergent procedures.
