Most countries have enforced severe restrictions in their respective zones to contain the menace of this disease. It surely feels like a world-war situation. The frontline soldiers in this battle against the Novel Corona Virus are the healthcare workers (doctors, nurses and other medical staff). It is becoming obvious that the incidence of infection in these frontline health workers is rampant across many countries, to the extent that several deaths have also been reported amongst them. There are several reasons for making the healthcare workers more susceptible to this disease: (a) overstretched health care facilities, (b) acute shortage of essential equipments like respirator masks, PPE, and ventilators, (c) high viral load in the hospitals. Sadly, these 'brave soldiers of the society are also facing social ostracisation from their landlords and society [5] .",
