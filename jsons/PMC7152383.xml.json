            "text": "Reoviruses were first discovered in the 1950s after isolation from human enteric specimens, and they were subsequently documented to infect a wide range of hosts. Reovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are found ubiquitously in the environment, and their sources include stagnant and river water and untreated sewage. The term reovirus is an acronym for respiratory enteric orphan virus, which emphasizes the anatomic site from which these viruses were initially isolated as well as the fact that infection of humans, although common, is only rarely associated with significant disease. Human infection primarily results in either asymptomatic infection or mild, self-limited symptoms such as upper respiratory tract illness and gastroenteritis.2, 3 Rarely, reoviruses have been identified as the causative agent in human cases of meningitis, encephalitis, pneumonia, and myocarditis and are potentially associated with biliary atresia and choledochal cysts (discussed later).2, 3, 4 Serologic studies of reovirus prevalence have documented steady increases from infancy (5% to 10% seropositivity at 1 year of age; 30% at 2 years of age; 50% at 5 years of age) through adulthood (50% at 20 to 30 years of age; >80% by 60 years of age),4, 5 reflecting immunity acquired as a consequence of natural infection. Despite this, it has been difficult to provide convincing evidence linking reoviruses to specific human diseases. Transmission occurs by the fecal-oral and airborne routes in humans. Reovirus infection serves as an important experimental animal model of viral encephalitis and myocarditis, a presentation of which is beyond the scope of this discussion but is reviewed in Chapters 86 and 91.6\n",

Rarer reports of lower respiratory tract disease have included interstitial or confluent pneumonia, one of which was fatal.9, 10 A novel reassortant reovirus designated as BYD1 strain was isolated in 2003 from five patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) who were coinfected with SARS-associated coronavirus. Subsequent characterization in animal experimental models has suggested a possible copathogenic role for this virus in SARS.11, 12 More recently, two new and closely related reoviruses (Melaka and Kampar viruses) have been identified and characterized from six adult and pediatric Malaysian patients with acute respiratory tract infection.13, 14 Both viruses are presumably of bat origin with transmission to humans by bat droppings or contaminated fruits. Index adult cases suffered from high fever, chills and rigors, sore throat, headache, and myalgia. Human-to-human transmission has been substantiated by serologic analysis of secondary cases, including children.",

The bulk of disease due to orbiviruses occurs in nonhuman vertebrates; the most frequently identified are bluetongue virus (sheep, cattle, goats, and wild ungulates), African horse sickness virus (horses, donkeys, and dogs), and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (deer). Disease in humans has been reported infrequently (fewer than 100 cases reported in the literature worldwide). However, infection can occur in humans who serve as an incidental host during the maintenance cycle of vector-borne transmission between nonhuman vertebrate hosts. Vectors for disease include mosquitoes, midges, gnats, sand flies, and ticks.31, 32\n",

Laboratory features include transient leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, suggesting possible rickettsial disease; however, serologic analysis for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Colorado tick fever, and Powassan virus was negative.31 Diagnosis was based on positive serology for Kemerovo group\u2013related orbiviruses (Sixgun City and Lipovnik viruses).
