In short, QSAR is a method to find correlations and mathematical models for congeneric series of compounds, affinities of ligands to their binding sites, rate constants, inhibition constants, toxicological effect, and many other biological activities, based on structural features, as well as group and molecular properties, such as electronic properties, polarizability, or steric properties (Klebe et al. 1994; Hansch et al. 1995; Karelson et al. 1996; Kubinyi 1997a, b; Perkins et al. 2003; Isayev et al. 2006; Martin 2009; Rasulev et al. 2010; Puzyn et al. 2011) .",

In addition, in case of available crystallographic data on the proteins, the QSAR models can be developed with the additional information from the three-dimensional (3D) structures of these proteins, interacting with drug candidates, by applying protein-ligand docking data for further QSAR analysis, or, if there is no data on 3D structure of protein, then developing QSAR based on three-dimensional features of investigated molecules (Moro et al. 2005; Ragno et al. 2005; Gupta et al. 2009; Hu et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2010; Ara\u00fajo et al. 2011; Ahmed et al. 2013 ). The second approach was named as 3D3D QSAR QSAR approach (Wise et al. 1983; Cramer and Bunce 1987; Cramer et al. 1988; Clark et al. 1990 ). There are also many other multidimensional approaches, including 4D QSAR and 5D QSAR, but all of them are just extension of QSAR analysis to a number of conformations (orientations, tautomers, stereoisomers, or protonation states) per molecule, number of concentrations (dosages) per compound, etc (Lill 2007) . In overall, when talking about 3D QSAR, computational chemists usually assume that the QSAR analysis takes into account a three-dimensional structure of the compound in minimal energy conformation and builds QSAR model based on various 3D fields generated (Kubinyi 1997a, b) .",

Later authors improved this approach and by combining the two existing techniques, GRID and PLS, has developed a powerful 3D QSAR methodology, so-called comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) (Cramer et al. 1988; Clark et al. 1990 ). Soon after, CoMFA has become a prototype of 3D QSAR methods (Kim et al. 1998; Todeschini and Gramatica 1998; Podlogar and Ferguson 2000) . CoMFA approach was then implemented in the Sybyl software (Tripos 2006 ) from Tripos Inc.",

Molecular docking and 3D QSAR model are the two potent methods in drug discovery process. Thus, virtual screening using 3D QSAR approaches followed by docking has become one of the reputable methods for drug discovery and enhancing the efficiency in lead optimization (Oprea and Matter 2004) . The main advantage of this combined approach of 3D QSAR and pharmacophore-based docking is to focus on specific key interaction for protein-ligand binding to improve drug candidates. Ameliorate the selection of active compounds; it is optimal to use both methods like molecular docking and 3D QSAR modeling (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2005; Klebe 2006; Perola 2006; Pajeva et al. 2009; Yang 2010) .",

The probe is located at the sample positions on a lattice throughout and around the macromolecule. The method offers two distinct advantages, one of them is the use of a 6-4 potential function for calculating the interaction energies, which is smoother than the 6-12 form of the Lennard-Jones type in CoMFA, and another advantage is the availability of different types of probes (Goodford 1985) . Moreover, the program in addition of computing the regular steric and electrostatic potentials also calculates the hydrogen bonding potential using a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, as well as the hydrophobic potential using a \"DRY probe.\" Later on, a water probe was included to calculate hydrophobic interactions (Kim et al. 1998; Kim 2001) .",

In the anchor-GRIND method (Fontaine et al. 2005) , to compare the MIF distribution of different compounds, the user defines a single common position in the structure of all the compounds in the series, so-called anchor point. This anchor point does not provide enough geometrical constrains to align the compounds studied; however, it is used by the method as a common reference point, making it possible to describe the geometry of the MIF regions in a more precise way than GRIND does. The anchor point is particularly easy to assign in datasets having some chemical substituents well known as being crucial for the activity. In the anchor-GRIND approach, the R groups are described with two blocks of variables: the anchor-MIF and the MIFMIF blocks (Fig. 2 ). The first one describes the geometrical distribution of the R MIF relative to the anchor point, while the second one describes the geometrical distribution of the MIF within each R group. These blocks are obtained after the following steps: (i) every R group is considered as attached to the scaffold, (ii) the anchor point is set automatically on an atom of the scaffold, (iii) a set of MIF are calculated with the program GRID (Goodford 1985) as well as the shape field implemented in the program Almond (Cruciani et al. 2004) , and (iv), as the last step, the blocks of descriptors are computed from the anchor point and the filtered MIF.

This method utilizes the active analogue principle that lies at the foundation of medicinal chemistry. Like many 3D QSAR methods, kNN-MFA requires suitable alignment of a given set of molecules. This is followed by generation of a common rectangular grid around the molecules. The steric and electrostatic interaction energies are computed at the lattice points of the grid using a methyl probe of charge C1. These interaction energy values are considered for relationship generation and utilized as descriptors to decide nearness between molecules.",

This is a novel approach that consists in encapsulating continuous molecular fields into specially constructed kernels. It is based on the application of continuous functions for the description of molecular fields instead of finite sets of molecular descriptors (such as interaction energies computed at grid nodes) commonly used for this purpose. The feasibility of using molecular-field kernels in combination with the support vector regression (SVR) machine learning method to build 3D QSAR models has been demonstrated by the same authors earlier (Zhokhova et al. 2009 ). Authors claim that by combining different types of molecular fields and methods of their approximation, different types of kernels with different types of kernel-based machine learning methods, it is possible not only to present lots of existing methods in chemoinformatics and medicinal chemistry as particular cases within a single methodology but also to develop new approaches aimed at solving new problems (Baskin and Zhokhova 2013) . The example of application of this approach is described later in this chapter.",

It includes some subprograms, for example, LigPrep, which attaches hydrogens, converts 2D structures to 3D, generates stereoisomers, and, optionally, neutralizes charged structures or determines the most probable ionization state at a user-defined pH. It also includes MacroModel conformational search engine to generate a series of 3D structures that sample the thermally accessible conformational states. For purposes of 3D modeling and pharmacophore model development, each ligand structure is represented by a set of points in 3D space, which coincide with various chemical features that may facilitate non-covalent binding between the ligand and its target receptor. PHASE provides six built-in types of pharmacophore features: hydrogen bond acceptor (A), hydrogen bond donor (D), hydrophobic (H), negative ionizable (N), positive ionizable (P), and aromatic ring (R). In addition, users may define up to three custom feature types (x, y, z) to account for characteristics that don't fit clearly into any of the six built-in categories. To construct a 3D QSAR model, a rectangular grid is defined to encompass the space occupied by the aligned training set molecules. This grid divides space into uniformly sized cubes, typically 1 \u00c5 on each side, which are occupied by the atoms or pharmacophore sites that define each molecule. APF -In 2008 , Totrov M (Totrov 2008 introduced atomic property fields (APF) for 3D QSAR analysis. APF concept is introduced as a continuous, multicomponent 3D potential that reflects preferences for various atomic properties at each point in space (Fig. 3) . The approach is extended to multiple flexible ligand alignments using an iterative procedure, Self-Consistent atomic Property Fields by Optimization (SCAPFOld). The application of atomic property fields and SCAPFOld for virtual ligand screening and 3D QSAR is tested on published benchmarks. The new method is shown to perform competitively in comparison to current state-of-the-art methods (CoMFA and CoMSIA).",

(2009) applied a receptor-and ligand-based 3D QSAR study for a series of 68 non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors (2amino-6-arylsulfonylbenzonitriles and their thio and sulfinyl congeners). Authors were applying docking simulations to position the inhibitors into RT active site to determine the most probable binding mode and most reliable conformations. This complex receptor-based and ligand-based alignment procedure and different alignment modes allowed authors to obtain reliable and predictive CoMFA and CoMSIA models with cross-validated q 2 value of 0.723 and 0.760, respectively. Authors concluded that the CoMFA steric and CoMSIA hydrophobic fields support the idea that bulkier and hydrophobic groups are favorable to bioactivity in the 3-and 5-positions of the B (benzene)-ring. At the same time, these groups are unfavorable in the 4-position. Also, the CoMSIA H-bond donor and acceptor fields suggest that the sulfide and sulfone inhibitors are more active than the sulfoxide ones due to H-bonding with protein residues.",

            "text": "It is good to mention here another interesting study where combination of methods is used, including molecular docking and 3D QSAR to develop a predictive QSAR model. Moro et al. (2006) suggested the use a combination of molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surface properties (autocorrelation vectors) with the conventional partial least-square (PLS) analysis to produce a robust ligand-based 3D structure-activity relationship (autoMEP/PLS). They applied this approach to predict human A3 receptor antagonist activities. First of all, the approach was suggested as an efficient and alternative pharmacodynamic-driven filtering method for small-size virtual libraries. For this, authors generated a small-sized combinatorial library (841 compounds) that was derived from the scaffold of the known human A3 antagonist pyrazolo-triazolo-pyrimidines (Moro et al. 2005) . This is another successful example of combined approach of docking and 3D QSAR to investigate and design active analogue compounds. Authors were using MULTIDOCK code that is part of MOE suite (Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 2016) to get a conformational sampling and then calculate interaction energies using MMFF94 (Halgren 1996) and use it for further steps. The MEPs were derived from a classical point charge model: the electrostatic potential for each molecule is obtained by moving a unit positive point charge across the van der Waals surface, and it is calculated at various points j on this surface (Moro et al. 2006) . Authors were able to test the approach by synthesizing several predicted potent compounds, and they found that all the newly synthesized compounds are correctly predicted as potent human A3 antagonists (Moro et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "Another PHASE application for 3D QSAR study is published by Pulla et al. (2016) . Authors applied a 3D QSAR approach to investigate silent mating-type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) which is the homologous enzyme of silent information regulator-2 gene in yeast. SIRT1 was believed to be overexpressed in many cancers (prostate, colon) and inflammatory disorders (rheumatoid arthritis); that is why it has good therapeutic importance. Authors conducted both structurebased and ligand-based drug design strategies with utilizing high-throughput virtual screening of chemical databases. Then an energy-based pharmacophore was generated using the crystal structure of SIRT1 bound with a small molecule inhibitor and compared with a ligand-based pharmacophore model that showed four similar features. A 3D QSAR model was developed and applied to generated structures. Among the designed compounds, Lead 17 emerged as a promising SIRT1 inhibitor with IC 50 of 4.34 M and, at nanomolar concentration (360 nM), attenuated the proliferation of prostate cancer cells (LnCAP) (Pulla et al. 2016) . The 3D QSAR model was developed using PHASE 3.4 module in Maestro 9.3 software package developed by Schrodinger, LLC (Dixon et al. 2006) . Docking studies were executed using Glide 5.8 module (Halgren et al. 2004) . Authors were validating the pharmacophore model by set composed of 1055 compounds, consisting of 1000 decoys and 55 known inhibitors. The drug-like decoy set of 1000 compounds was obtained from the Glide module (Halgren et al. 2004) . A final 3D QSAR model was developed based on dataset of 79 molecules reported as SIRT1 inhibitors in various literatures. To develop QSAR model, PHASE module relied on PLS regression applied to a large set of binary-valued variables. Each independent variable in the model originated from the grid of cubic volume elements spanning the space occupied by the training set ligands. Each training ligand in the training set was represented by binary code consisting of set of bit values (0 or 1) indicating the volume of elements occupied by van der Waals model of the ligand. Authors were able to get a very good 3D QSAR model with r 2 D 0.953, q 2 D 0.908, and r 2 ext D 0.941. A validated 3D QSAR model (for ADHRR 802) authors used to generate contour maps could help in understanding the importance of functional groups at specific positions toward biological activity. These insights could be known by comparing the contour maps of the most and least active compounds, as shown in Fig. 5 represented in Pulla et al. (2016) . The blue and red cubes indicated the favorable and unfavorable regions, respectively, of the hydrogen bond donor effect, while light-red and yellow cubes indicated favorable and unfavorable regions, respectively, of the hydrophobic effect, and the cyan and orange cubes indicated favorable and unfavorable regions, respectively, of the electron-withdrawing effect. From Fig. 5a , it can be seen that the blue favorable regions of the hydrogen bond donor effect were nearer to the donor feature (D5) of the active molecule; however, it could also be observed that blue boxes were also concentrated at the amide group beside thiophen, thus illustrating that additional donor groups at these regions (blue cubes) could increase biological activity. At the same time, in the inactive molecule, red unfavorable boxes were observed around the donor feature (D5), inferring the biological inactiveness of the molecule. In the case of the hydrophobic effect, the light-red color cubes were seen surrounding the hydrophobic feature (H8, piperidine) of the active molecule, whereas the presence of few yellow unfavorable cubes indicated that these hydrophobic groups were not in the right position in the inactive molecule, illustrating the weak biological activity. Next, in the case of the electron-withdrawing effect of the active molecule, the favorable cyan cubes were seen around the acceptor feature (A3), and cyan cubes were also seen near the pyrimidine ring. It inferred that the acceptor features near the pyrimidine ring could further increase the bioactivity of the molecule. However, in the case of the inactive molecule, mostly unfavorable orange cubes were observed around the acceptor feature (A3), illustrating the importance of the electron-withdrawing group in the activity of lead molecules.",

The study was based on novel 3D-HoVAIFA method which is based on three-dimensional holographic vector of atomic interaction field analysis (Zhou et al. 2007 ). As it was mentioned above, initially the holographic vector for 3D QSAR was developed by (Zhou et al. 2007 ). The method uses atomic relative distance and atomic properties on the bases of three common nonbonded (electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydrophobic) interactions which are directly associated with bioactivities, and then 3D-HoVAIF method derives multidimensional vectors to represent molecular steric structural characteristics for further 3D QSAR analysis. Similarly to previous study, authors conducted a docking study to find the best docking pose and template for alignment. Then authors were able to get good models for a large dataset of 124 compounds and received the following correlation coefficients, r 2 D 0.789 and r 2 cv D 0.732. Authors claim that 3D-HoVAIFA can be applicable to molecular structural characterization and bioactivity prediction. In addition, it was showed that HoVAIFA and docking results are corresponding (Sun et al. 2010) , which illustrates that HoVAIFA is an effective methodology for characterization of complex interactions of drug molecules.",

Almost for all cases authors received better statistics than in original works. For example, for ACE inhibitors, CMF approach showed q 2 D 0.72, while CoMFA and CoMSIA showed 0.68 and 0.65, respectively. 3D QSAR for AChE inhibitors showed for CMF q 2 D 0.58, while for CoMFA and CoMSIA, it was 0.52 and 0.48, respectively. 3D QSAR for DHFR inhibitors showed for CMF q 2 D 0.67, while for CoMFA and CoMSIA, it was only 0.49 and 0.53, respectively. Other datasets also showed better results. The only one dataset, for BZR receptors, showed not so high values (q 2 D 0.40) but comparable with previous data received by CoMFA and CoMSIA -0.32 and 0.41, respectively. As follows from the results presented in this paper, this particular implementation of the CMF approach provides an appealing alternative to the traditional lattice-based methodology. This method provides either comparable or enhanced predictive performance in comparison with state-of-theart 3D QSAR methods, such as CoMFA and CoMSIA. Authors also discussed advantages and disadvantages of this approach. The potential advantages of this approach result from the ability to approximate electronic molecular structures with any desirable accuracy level, the ability to leverage the valuable information contained in partial derivatives of molecular fields (otherwise lost upon discretization) to analyze models and enhance their predictive performance, the ability to apply integral transforms to molecular fields and models, etc. The most attractive features of the CMF approach are its versatility and universality. At the same time, of the most serious limitations of the CMF approach, at least in its present form, comes from the mere nature of kernel-based machine learning methods. The amount of computational resources needed to calculate a kernel matrix scales as a square of the number of compounds in the training set. The mean amount of computational resources needed to calculate each element of a kernel matrix also scales as a square of the average number of atoms in molecules. As a result, it becomes impractical to build 3D QSAR models using a training set with more than 300 medium-sized compounds (Baskin and Zhokhova 2013) .",

Authors proposed for the first time a combination approach to integrate the pharmacophore (PhModel) (Taha et al. 2008) , CoMFA, and CoMSIA models for B-RAF (RAF family of serine/threonine kinases). The PhModel was implemented by the program Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.1. First, authors established ten PhModels and used them to align diverse inhibitor structures for generating the CoMFA and CoMSIA models. Then the partial least-square (PLS) method was used and known B-RAF inhibitors to validate the prediction ability of CoMFA and CoMSIA models. Finally, the goodness of hit (GH) test score was used as a benchmark for appraising the prediction ability of CoMFA and CoMSIA models to screen a compound database. Thus, ten PhModels were generated based on the 27 training set inhibitors. Each PhModel included four features: hydrogen bond acceptor (A), hydrogen bond donor (D), hydrophobic (HY), and ring aromatic (RA). The correlation coefficients for ten PhModels were very good and ranged from 0.964 to 0.902. Authors claim that this approach could be applied to screen inhibitor databases, optimize inhibitor structures, and identify novelty potent or specific inhibitors (Shih et al. 2011) .",

Considering the difficulty in the accurate estimation of electrostatic interaction, the QM-polarized ligand docking and GBSA rescoring were applied to predict probable poses of these inhibitors bound into the active site of B-RAF kinase. To obtain the rational conformation for developing 3D QSAR models, authors applied the docking-based conformation selection strategy. Moreover, the detailed interactions were analyzed on the basis of the results from MD simulation and the free energy calculation for two inhibitors with much difference in their activity. Authors investigated 61 B-RAF inhibitors and developed CoMFA and CoMSIA models with r 2 D 0.917 and 0.940, respectively. In result, the structure-based 3D QSAR models provided a further structural analysis and modifiable information for understanding the SARs of these inhibitors. The important hydrophobic property of the 3-substitution of B-ring was required to be type 2 inhibitors. The five substitutable positions of the C-ring could be further modified. Authors concluded that the results obtained from the combined computational approach will be helpful for the rational design of novel type 2 RAF kinase inhibitors.",

Since currently in worlds life science, research is going on the booming of interactome studies, a lot of interactions can be measured in a high-throughput way, taking into account that large-scale datasets are already available. Studies show that many different types of interactions can be potential drug targets. This boom of HTS studies greatly broadens the drug target search space, which makes the drug target discovery difficult. In this case, computational methods are highly desired to efficiently provide candidates for further experiments and hold the promise to greatly accelerate the discovery of novel drug targets. Thus, Wang et al. (2016) published a study where they suggested a new method, where inhibition of protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis offered as a promising source to improve the specificity of drugs with fewer adverse side effects. They proposed a machine learning method to predict PPI targets in a genomic-wide scale. Authors developed a computational method, named as PrePPItar (Wang et al. 2016) , to predict PPIs as drug targets by uncovering the potential associations between drugs and PPIs (Fig. 7) . Authors investigated the databases and manually constructed a gold-standard positive dataset for drug and PPI interactions. Their effort leads to a dataset with 227 associations among 63 PPIs and 113 FDA-approved drugs and allowed them to build models and learn the association rules from the data. Also, authors were able to characterize drugs by profiling in chemical structure, drug ATC-code annotation, and side-effect space and represent PPI similarity by a symmetrical S-kernel based on protein amino acid sequence. At the end, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to predict novel associations between drugs and PPIs. The PrePPItar method was validated on the well-established gold-standard dataset. Authors found that all chemical structures, drug ATC code, and side-effect information are predictive for PPI target. Authors claim that PrePPItar can serve as a useful tool for PPI target discovery and provide a general heterogeneous data-integrative framework. PrePPItar applies the kernel fusion method to integrate multiple information about drug, including chemical structure, ATC code, and drug side effect to detect the interactions between drugs and PPIs.

Moreover, authors conducted MD simulations of ligand-free and the inhibitor bound HIV-1 PR systems to complement some previous studies and to provide proper input structure of HIV-1 PR in further docking simulations. Then, five different combinations of stereoelectronic fields of 3D QSAR/CoMSIA models were obtained from the set of biologically evaluated and computationally designed fullerene derivatives (where training set D 43 and test set D 6) in order to predict novel compounds with improved inhibition effect. The best 3D QSAR/CoMSIA model yielded a cross-validated r 2 value of 0.739 and a non-cross-validated r 2 value of 0.993.

In addition, the derived contour plots together with applied de novo drug design were then used as pilot models for proposing the novel analogues with enhanced binding affinities.

Authors used in silico screening approach in order to propose potent fullerene analogues as anti-HIV drugs. Two of the most promising derivatives showing significant binding scores were subjected to biological studies that confirmed the efficacy of the new compounds. The results showed that new leads can be discovered possessing higher bioactivity. Authors used docking approach together with MD simulations to get the best hits during the virtual screening. (Durdagi et al. 2008a ). Copyright Elsevier, 2008 In 2011, the same group provided further analysis to design better anti-HIV fullerene-based inhibitors (Tzoupis et al. 2011) . In this study authors employed a docking technique, two 3D QSAR models, MD simulations and the MM-PBSA method. In particular, authors investigated (1) hydrogen bonding (H-bond) interactions between specific fullerene derivatives and the protease, (2) the regions of HIV-1 PR that play a significant role in binding, (3) protease changes upon binding, and (4) various contributions to the binding free energy, in order to identify the most significant of them. The CoMFA and CoMSIA methods were applied too, to build 3D QSAR models, where good correlation coefficients were received, for both methods, r 2 D 0.842 and 0.928, respectively. Authors claim that the computed binding free energies are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results. Another group published in 2013 a study that conducted a comprehensive investigation of fullerene analogues by combined computational approach including quantum chemical, molecular docking, and 3D descriptors-based QSAR (Ahmed et al. 2013) . Authors stated that the protein-ligand docking studies and improved structure-activity models have been able both to predict binding affinities for the set of fullerene-C 60 derivatives and to help in finding mechanisms of fullerene derivative interactions with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 aspartic protease, HIV-1 PR. Protein-ligand docking revealed several important molecular fragments that are responsible for the interaction with HIV-1 PR (Fig. 9 ). In addition, a density functional theory method has been utilized to identify the optimal geometries and predict physicochemical parameters of 49 studied compounds. The five-variable GA-MLRA-based model showed the best predictive ability (r 2 train D 0.882 and r 2 test D 0.738), with high internal and external correlation coefficients. Calvaresi and Zerbetto (2010) published a study where they investigated a fullerene binding with a set of proteins. Authors investigated about 20 proteins that are known to modify their activity upon interaction with C60. The set was examined using PatchDock (Schneidman-Duhovny et al. 2005) software with an algorithm that appraises quantitatively the interaction of C60 and the surface of each protein. The redundancy of the set allowed them to establish the predictive power of the approach that finds explicitly the most probable site where C60 docks on each protein. About 80 % of the known fullerene-binding proteins fall in the top 10 % of scorers. The close match between the model and experiments vouches for the accuracy of the model and validates its predictions. Authors identified the sites of docking and discussed them in view of the existing experimental data available for protein C60 interaction. In addition, authors identified new proteins that can interact with C60 and discussed for possible future applications as drug targets and fullerene derivative bioconjugate materials.",

A set of 1099 protein structures is divided into four categories that either select C60 or C70 (p-C60 or p-C70) and either accommodate the cages in the same pocket or in different pockets. Thus, authors also confirmed the agreement with the experiments, where the KcsA potassium channel is predicted to have one of the best performances for both cages.",

In this study, authors proposed detailed mechanisms of action, relating to nanotoxicity, for a series of decorated (functionalized) carbon nanotube complexes based on previously reported QSAR models. Possible mechanisms of nanotoxicity for six endpoints (bovine serum albumin, carbonic anhydrase, chymotrypsin, hemoglobin along with cell viability, and nitrogen oxide production) have been extracted from the corresponding optimized QSAR models. The molecular features relevant to each of the endpoint respective mechanism of action for the decorated nanotubes are also discussed in the study. Based on the molecular information contained within the optimal QSAR models for each nanotoxicity endpoint, either the decorator attached to the nanotube is directly responsible for the expression of a particular activity, irrespective of the decorator's 3D geometry and independent of the nanotube, or those decorators having structures that place the functional groups of the decorators as far as possible from the nanotube surface most strongly influence the biological activity.",

Authors made a simulation to analyze the interaction of nanomaterials with biomolecular systems, where they performed density functional calculations on the interaction of pyrazinamide (PZA) drug with functionalized single-wall CNT (fSWCNT) as a function of nanotube chirality and length, followed by docking simulation of fSWCNT with pncA protein. The functionalization of pristine SWCNT that facilitates in enhancing the reactivity of the nanotubes and formation of such type of nanotube-drug conjugate is thermodynamically feasible. Docking studies predicted the plausible binding mechanism and suggested that PZA loaded fSWCNT facilitates in the target-specific binding of PZA within the protein following a lock and key mechanism. Authors noticed that no major structural deformation in the protein was observed after binding with CNT, and the interaction between ligand and receptor is mainly hydrophobic in nature. Authors anticipate that these findings may provide new routes toward the drug delivery mechanism by CNTs with long-term practical implications in tuberculosischemotherapy.",

            "text": "In another study, Turabekova et al. (2014) published a comprehensive study of carbon nanotube and pristine fullerene interactions with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are responsible for immune response. Having experimental data on hands and conducting comprehensive protein-ligand investigation, authors were able to show that CNT and fullerenes can bind to certain TLRs. Authors suggested a hypothetical model providing the potential mechanistic explanation for immune and inflammatory responses observed upon exposure to carbon nanoparticles. Specifically, authors performed a theoretical study to analyze CNT and C60 fullerene interactions with the available X-ray structures of TLR homo-and heterodimer extracellular domains. This assumption was based on the fact that similar to the known TLR ligands, both CNTs and fullerenes induce, in cells, the secretion of certain inflammatory protein mediators, such as interleukins and chemokines. These proteins are observed within inflammation downstream processes resulting from the ligand molecule-dependent inhibition or activation of TLR-induced signal transduction. The computational studies have shown that the internal hydrophobic pockets of some TLRs might be capable of binding small-sized carbon nanostructures (5,5 armchair SWCNTs containing 11 carbon atom layers and C60 fullerene). High binding scores and minor structural alterations induced in TLR ectodomains upon binding C60 and CNTs further supported the proposed hypothesis (Fig. 10) . Additionally, the proposed hypothesis is strengthened by the indirect experimental Fig. 10 5,5 CNT-bound TLR1/TLR2 ECDs: (a) 5,5 CNT is bound to the TLR1 and TLR2 ECD interface dimerization area, (b) aligned structures of TLR2 ECDs before (green carbon atoms) and after (blue carbon atoms) the impact OPLS2005 refinement upon binding 5,5 CNTs. The orientation of two parallel entrance loops and the side chains of hydrophobic Phe349, Phe325, and Leu328 preventing the nanotube from intrusion are shown to be optimized (Reproduced with Permission from reference (Turabekova et al. 2014) .

The development of methods for 3D QSAR still continues, giving improved predictions for conventional organic compounds.
