However, in complex multicellular organisms, the core molecular machinery of autophagy -the 'autophagy proteins' -orchestrates diverse aspects of cellular and organismal responses to other dangerous stimuli such as infection. Recent developments reveal a crucial role for the autophagy pathway and proteins in immunity and inflammation. They balance the beneficial and detrimental effects of immunity and inflammation, and thereby may protect against infectious, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

Indeed, the mutation of autophagy genes increases susceptibility to infection by intracellular pathogens in organisms ranging from plants to flies to worms to mice, and possibly to humans.

The same machinery might therefore be expected to diversify functionally in complex metazoan organisms, so as to regulate new layers of defences used by multicellular organisms to confront different forms of stress. A plethora of genetic, biochemistry, cell biology, systems biology and genomic studies have recently converged to support this notion. The autophagy machinery interfaces with most cellular stress-response pathways 3 , including those involved in controlling immune responses and inflammation. This interface is not only at the level of the autophagy pathway, but also entails direct interactions between autophagy proteins and immune signalling molecules 4 . There is a complex reciprocal relationship between the autophagy pathway/proteins and immunity and inflammation; the autophagy proteins function in both the induction and suppression of immune and inflammatory responses, and immune and inflammatory signals function in both the induction and suppression of autophagy. Moreover, similar to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and ageing 5 , defects in autophagy -through autophagy gene mutation and/or microbial antagonism -may underlie the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases and inflammatory syndromes.",

There are at least three different types of autophagy, including macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy and microautophagy. Macroautophagy, usually referred to simply as autophagy, is the subject of this Review (Fig. 1 ). In this pathway, a portion of cytoplasm (usually 0.5-1 \u03bcm in diameter) is engulfed by an isolation membrane, or 'phagophore' , resulting in the formation of a double-membrane structure known as the autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome to become an autolysosome, leading to the degradation of autophagosomal contents by lysosomal enzymes. Autophagosomes can also fuse with endosomes or multivesicular bodies and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)class-II-loading compartments 7 . Autolysosomes become larger as more autophagosomes and lysosomes fuse, but at a termination phase lysosomes are tubulated and fragmented for renewal 8 .",

Autophagy proteins are required for the fusion of phagosomes that contain Toll-like receptor (TLR)-ligand-enveloped particles with lysosomes in macrophages 31 , and for the fusion of phagosomes that contain TLR-agonist-associated apoptotic cell antigens with lysosomes in dendritic cells during MHC class II antigen presentation 32 . The self ligand and cell-surface receptor SLAM functions as a microbial sensor that recruits the beclin 1-class III PI(3)K complex to phagosomes containing Gram-negative bacteria, facilitating phagolysosomal fusion and activation of the antibacterial NADPH oxidase (NOX2) complex 33 . In addition, the engagement of TLR or Fc\u03b3 receptors during phagocytosis recruits LC3 (and ATG12) to the phagosome through NOX2dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 34 . Thus, in bacterial infections, a paradigm is emerging in which the coordinated regulation of microbial sensing, phagolysosomal maturation and antibacterial activity involves the recruitment of autophagy proteins to the phagosome. As a corollary, an interesting speculation is that impaired recruitment of autophagy proteins to the phagosome may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic granulomatous disease, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NOX2 gene (also known as CYBB) and characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and inflammatory complications, such as inflammatory bowel disease.",

For example, Shigella vacuolar membrane remnants generated by bacterial T3SS-dependent membrane damage are targeted by polyubiquitination, p62 and LC3 for autophagosomal degradation 41 (Fig. 2) . These membrane remnants also accumulate numerous molecules involved in sensing and transduction of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signals, and there is an increase in nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-dependent cytokine production, ROS production and necrotic cell death in autophagy-deficient cells. Thus, the ubiquitin-p62-dependent autophagic targeting of pathogen-damaged membranes could help to control detrimental downstream inflammatory signalling during bacterial invasion into host cells. Another emerging concept is that selective autophagy of viral proteins, similar to selective autophagy of aggregate-prone toxic cellular proteins, may protect post-mitotic cells such as neurons against cell death. For example, in Sindbis-virus-infected mice with neuron-specific inactivation of Atg5, there is an accumulation of Sindbis virus antigens (without increased levels of infectious virus), increased neuronal cell death and increased animal mortality 40 . Moreover, p62 is required for starvation and IFN-\u03b3-induced targeting of Fau (and perhaps other ubiquitylated protein complexes) to mycobacteria-containing phagosomes, resulting in the generation of antimycobacterial Fau-derived peptides 42 .The role of p62 in innate immunity is probably evolutionarily ancient, as the Drosophila p62 orthologue REF(2)P was originally identified in a screen for modifiers of sigma virus replication 43 .",

A recent proteomics study showed that the mammalian ATG8 family, which includes LC3, GATE16 and GABARAP, has 67 high-confidence interactions with other cellular proteins 21 . Some of these new ATG8-familymember-interacting partners may have an as yet undiscovered role in innate immunity.

In other organisms, autophagy proteins function in a cell-autonomous manner to control infection by intracellular pathogens. In Drosophila, autophagy gene mutation increases susceptibility to viral (vesicular stomatitis virus) 46 and bacterial (L. monocytogenes) 47 infection. In Dictyostelium and Caenorhabditis elegans, autophagy gene mutation increases susceptibility to lethal S. Typhimurium infection 48 . In mice, knockout of Atg5 in macrophages and neutrophils increases susceptibility to infection with L. monocytogenes and the protozoan T. gondii 35 , and neuron-specific Atg5 knockout increases susceptibility to central nervous system Sindbis virus infection 40 . As noted in the next section, the autophagy pathway and proteins may also have 'proviral' or 'probacterial' effects in in vitro studies; however, in vivo evidence for such effects is so far lacking. The mechanisms by which autophagy genes mediate in vivo resistance to infection are not fully understood, but are likely to involve a combination of xenophagy, other autophagy-protein-dependent effects on microbial replication or survival, activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and/or alterations in pathogen-induced cell death (Fig. 3 ). An important question is whether this function of autophagy in broad resistance to infection with intracellular pathogens extends to humans. Recent human genetic studies provide some clues. The immunityrelated GTPase human IRGM, which regulates autophagy-dependent clearance of mycobacteria in vitro 49 , was identified as a genetic risk locus for tuberculosis in a West African population 50 . Numerous studies have shown a crucial role for autophagy in defence against mycobacterial infection in human cells 1 , and a genome-wide analysis of host genes that regulate Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication demonstrated that a predominance of factors were autophagy regulators 51 . Thus, it is possible that autophagy has a central role in resistance to one of the most important global infectious diseases -tuberculosis. Mutations in NOD2, which encodes an intracellular pathogen-recognition receptor (nucleotide-binding oligomerization-domain-containing protein 2) that functions in bacterial autophagy 52, 53 , are also associated with susceptibility to infection with another mycobacterial agent, Mycobacterium leprae, the aetiological agent of leprosy 54 . An exciting future venture will be to confirm whether IRGM, NOD2 and other autophagy-related genes are involved in resistance to infection with mycobacteria and other infections in further human populations and, if so, whether this resistance is mediated by autophagy.",

            "text": "Microbes undergo strong selective pressure to develop strategies to block host defence mechanisms; the number of such strategies is a surrogate measure of the importance of the host defence mechanism in immunity. As reviewed elsewhere 1,55 , viruses and intracellular bacteria have evolved several ways to adapt to host autophagy. They can antagonize autophagy initiation or autophagosomal maturation, evade autophagic recognition, or use components of the autophagy pathway to facilitate their own replication or intracellular survival. An emerging theme is that microbial antagonism of autophagy not only blocks the xenophagic degradation of intracellular pathogens, but also blocks the functions of autophagy in innate and adaptive immunity. A relatively unexplored yet crucially important frontier is how microbial antagonism may contribute more broadly to the role of microbes in diseases characterized by defective autophagy, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, ageing and, potentially, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Viral strategies to shut off autophagy include the blockade of positive upstream regulators of autophagy (such as the IFN-inducible RNA-activated eIF2\u03b1 protein kinase (PKR) signalling pathway), the activation of negative upstream regulators of autophagy (such as the nutrient-sensing TOR kinase signalling pathway) or direct antagonism of the autophagy machinery 55 . The overlapping functions of the eIF2\u03b1 kinase signalling pathway in stress-induced general translational arrest, transcriptional activation of stress-response genes and stress-induced autophagy enable viruses to disarm several facets of the cellular stress response to infection by one mechanism -that is, antagonism of eIF2\u03b1 kinase signalling. The mTOR signalling pathway has a central role in the control of cell growth and metabolism, and interestingly, many of the viruses that activate mTOR are oncogenic (for example, Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, hepatitis B virus and retroviruses). This suggests another type of pluripotent viral weapon -one that can promote oncogenesis by simultaneously inactivating autophagy and promoting cell growth through TOR activation. HIV envelope protein-dependent activation of mTOR signalling is also proposed to be a mechanism for HIV evasion of innate and adaptive immune responses in dendritic cells, including the degradation of incoming virions by lysosomes, blockade of HIV transfer to CD4 + T cells, stimulation of TLR4 and TLR8 ligand responses, and presentation of HIV Gag antigen to CD4 + T cells 56 . It will be important to determine whether these effects of HIV-mediated mTOR activation and autophagy inhibition contribute to impaired dendritic cell function during HIV infection in vivo.",

The interactions between beclin 1, HSV-1 ICP34.5 and viral BCL2 are probably physiologically important in vivo; a mutant HSV-1 virus lacking the beclin-1-binding domain of ICP34.5 is attenuated in mouse models of encephalitis (presumably through its failure to control xenophagy and innate immunity) 57 and of corneal disease (through its failure to control adaptive immunity) 58 . Moreover, a mouse \u03b3-herpesvirus that encodes a mutant viral BCL2 unable to bind to beclin 1 demonstrates impaired ability to maintain chronic infection 59 Review insight beclin 1 is preferentially targeted by viral virulence proteins because of its central role in autophagosome formation, or more likely, whether we are just beginning to identify pairs of viral proteins and their autophagy pathway targets.

As reviewed elsewhere 1,38 , many bacteria that reside in phagosomes or other vacuolar compartments have methods to inhibit lysosomal fusion or maturation, which, in the case of mycobacteria, can be partially overcome by treatments that stimulate autophagy. Another possible mechanism for bacterial evasion of autophagy has emerged from a genome-wide screen to identify host factors that regulate the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis 51 . According to bioinformatics analyses, M. tuberculosis infection of human macrophage-like cells activates cellular pathways that inhibit autophagy. Intracellular bacteria that escape into the cytoplasm, such as S. flexneri and L. monocytogenes, use strategies to camouflage themselves to avoid autophagic recognition. The Shigella T3SS effector IcsB competitively binds to VirG, thereby preventing the interaction between ATG5 and VirG, a bacterial surface protein required for actin-based motility and Shigella targeting to autophagosomes 38 . The Listeria protein ActA interacts with cytosolic actin polymerization machinery (ARP2/3, VASP and actin), which blocks bacterial association with ubiquitin, p62 recruitment and autophagic targeting 61 . The precise mechanism of this block is unknown, but it has been proposed that the ActA-dependent recruitment of host cell cytoskeletal proteins may enable the bacterium to disguise itself as a host cell organelle 61 . This concept sheds light on the autophagy pathway in a fundamental aspect of immunology -the basis for discrimination between self and non-self.",

It is possible that autophagy proteins function to provide membrane for viral replication complexes or translation machinery. This may be true for viruses such as hepatitis C virus, for which genetic knockdown of several different autophagy genes decreases productive replication 64 . However, for other viruses such as coronaviruses, the biogenesis of double-membrane, ER-derived vesicles used for replication proceeds through a pathway that involves the nonlipidated form of LC3 (LC3-I) but not the general autophagy machinery 66 . Thus, caution must be exercised in interpreting the significance of the co-localization (or biochemical interaction) of viral proteins and LC3, as LC3 may have autophagy-independent roles in membrane dynamics.",

High mobility group box (HMGB) proteins have also been shown to function as both universal sensors of nucleic acids in innate immune signalling 67 and inducers of autophagy 68 . Autophagy is inhibited by BCL2, NF-\u03baB, T helper 2 (T H 2) cytokines and the canonical nutrient-sensing insulin-AKT-TOR pathway. Inactivation of this nutrient-sensing pathway may contribute to vesicular stomatitis virus stimulation of autophagy in Drosophila 46 , and autophagy activation in C. elegans with loss-of-function mutations in this pathway may mediate pathogen resistance in long-lived mutant nematodes 48 .

Although cathelicidin is required for vitamin-D3-dependent transcriptional upregulation of autophagy genes such as BECN1 and ATG5, and vitamin D3 enhances the recruitment of cathelicidin to autophagosomes, it is not yet clear how cathelicidin promotes autophagy.

These findings raise the possibility that cytokines may have a broader role in the control of autophagy than previously thought. Moreover, because these cytokine signalling pathways are important in immune cells, another central question is to what extent cytokinemediated regulation of autophagy governs immune cell function.

In T cells, in which mitochondrial numbers are developmentally regulated during the transition from thymocyte to mature circulating T cell, the developmental defect in autophagy-deficient cells may be related to the defective clearance of mitochondria 44 .

Genetic disruption of Atg5 in thymic epithelial cells leads to the altered selection of certain MHC class II restricted T-cell specificities and autoimmunity 73 . Beyond these functions in lymph ocyte survival and thymic negative selection, autophagy may exert other functions in lymphocyte differentiation, perhaps, in part, indirectly through effects on cytokine expression (see the next section).

Atg5-deficient dendritic cells have normal migration, innate responses, endocytic and phagocytic activity and cross-presentation of peptides on MHC class I molecules. However, they exhibit defects in phagosome-to-lysosome fusion and in cross-presentation by MHC class II molecules of phagocytosed antigens containing TLR ligand. Thus, the interior of the phagosome, like that of the autophagosome, is a cellular compartment that autophagyprotein-dependent antigen presentation accesses to generate peptides for presentation to CD4 + T cells. A potential evolutionary advantage of this autophagy-protein-dependent cross-presentation is that, by delegating antigen presentation duties to uninfected dendritic cells, the host can bypass the blockade of antigen presentation that may result from microbial antagonism of autophagy in infected cells.",

Dendritic cells expressing Crohn's disease NOD2 risk variants are defective in both of these functions 52 .

In mice raised in a pathogen-free facility, only Atg16l1 HM mice (and not wild-type mice) infected with a virus found in routine conventional animal facilities, a murine norovirus, showed abnormal Paneth cell granule secretion, Paneth cell proinflammatory gene-expression profiles, and intestinal inflammation in response to DSS treatment 90 . This mucosal inflammation depended on the presence of the microbiome and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as it was reversed by antibiotic treatment or by TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 inhibition. Thus, variations in a host autophagy gene, exposure to a specific virus and the microbiome can act together to trigger intestinal inflammation in mice that is similar to that in patients with Crohn's disease. Although environmental factors, including the gut microbiome, have long been suspected to contribute to Crohn's disease in genetically susceptible individuals, formal proof of this concept was lacking, and viruses were a previously unsuspected trigger. Another implication of this work is the concept that autophagy proteins, through their diverse roles in immunity and the control of inflammation, may serve as a central rheostat that prevents inflammatory diseases triggered by environmental stress (Fig. 4 ).",

Genome-wide association studies have linked several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATG5 to SLE susceptibility [91] [92] [93] . SLE is a multifactorial, heterogeneous disease characterized by autoimmune responses against self-antigens generated from dying cells. Although the effects of these SNPs on ATG5 expression and function are not known, the lack of Atg5-dependent negative thymic selection generates autoimmunity and multi-organ inflammation in mice 73 .

An overview of the many possible mechanisms by which defects in autophagy and autophagy protein function may contribute to the pathogenesis of a type of inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease. A micrograph of a human small intestine from a patient with Crohn's disease is shown (centre), demonstrating the severe transmural inflammation that is characteristic of this disease. The postulated mechanisms by which defects in autophagy protein function might contribute to the development or perpetuation of intestinal inflammation are based on studies in vitro and animal models. There is no direct evidence that autophagy defects contribute to human Crohn's disease, although mutations in three autophagy-related genes, ATG16L1, NOD2 and IRGM, are known to enhance risk of the disease. E, epithelium; IgM, immunoglobulin M; L, lumen; LA, lymphoid aggregates; TM, thickened muscle. Scale bar, 200 \u00b5m. antigen presentation 32 , might also contribute to the autoimmunity and inflammation associated with SLE. Thus, a link between ATG5 mutation (or mutation of other autophagy genes) and SLE pathogenesis is biologically plausible, although not yet proven.",

Although most components of the metabolic inflammasome promote autophagy, the induction of autophagy by this signalling complex would be expected to serve as a negativefeedback mechanism that limits ER stress and disease progression. Consistent with this postulated protective effect of autophagy, hepatic suppression of the autophagy gene Atg7 in mice results in increased ER stress and insulin resistance 95 , and mice deficient in the autophagy adaptor protein p62 develop mature-onset obesity and insulin resistance 96 . Furthermore, obesity is associated with the accumulation and activation of macrophages and subsets of T cells in adipose tissue and the production of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 (ref. 97) . Thus, the failure of autophagy-dependent control of ER stress, immune cell homeostasis, immune cell activation and/or pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion may contribute to inflammation-associated responses that underlie the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.",

For the first time, pharmacological and genetic manipulation of autophagy, which built on the discoveries of the yeast screens that identified the autophagy machinery, challenged the very notion of autophagy as an 'auto'-(self), 'phagy' (eating) pathway. Indeed, we learned that the same genes that are used to orchestrate the degradation of self-constituents, either for nutritional/energy homeostasis or cellular damage control, are also used to orchestrate the degradation of foreign invaders, termed xenophagy.",

The autophagy machinery does much more than form autophagosomes to engulf microbes -it somehow allows microbes in phagosomes and vacuoles to be targeted to the lysosome; it enables crucial cells in the immune system to develop properly and perform some of their 'normal' functions (such as produce IFN, secrete antimicrobial peptides or present antigens to stimulate adaptive immunity); and it ensures that these responses do not become out of control by functioning in central immunological tolerance and the negative regulation of innate and inflammatory signalling.
