Cytologic evaluation of exudates, bone marrow aspirates, blood smears, synovial fluid, gastric brushings, duodenal secretions, urine, prostatic washings, airway washings, fecal smears, tissue imprints, skin scrapings, and aspiration biopsies is inexpensive and is considered a primary diagnostic procedure for many clinical infectious diseases. Stains routinely used for the diagnosis of infectious agents in small animal practice include Wright's-Giemsa, Diff-Quik, acid-fast, and Gram stains. The laboratory should be contacted for specific specimen handling information based on the suspected organism.",

Ehrlichia spp infections are examples of common infectious agents rarely documented cytologically. These agents generally require results of serology and PCR to confirm exposure or current infection. Some organisms like respiratory Mycoplasma spp are rarely documented cytologically because of their small size, whereas other organisms require special stains for optimal visualization. For example, Mycobacterium spp are not readily stained by rapid stains used in small animal practices, and if macrophages or neutrophils are detected, acid-fast staining is indicated to assess for the organisms within the cytoplasm of infected cells.

In this situation, it is unknown whether the antigen test is falsely positive or the fecal flotation is falsely negative. None of the currently available C. parvum antigen tests marketed for use with human feces consistently detects C. felis or C. canis and so should not be used with feces from dogs and cats. However, a direct fluorescent antibody assay for human cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis detects dog and cat strains and is available at most commercial laboratories.

These procedures are particularly valuable for the detection of viral diseases, detection of agents present in small numbers, and differentiation among agents with similar morphologic features. Tissues collected from animals with suspected infectious diseases can be evaluated by several different techniques. For example, focal feline infectious peritonitis granulomatous disease can be documented by immunohistochemical staining.7 Tissue samples should be aseptically placed in appropriate transport media for culture procedures or inoculated into laboratory animals, if indicated, before further handling. Gently blotting the cut edge of the tissue on a paper towel to remove excess blood and then lightly touching the tissue multiple times to a microscope slide make tissue impressions for cytological or immunocytological examination. Tissue specimens can then be frozen, placed into 10% buffered formalin solution, or placed into glutaraldehyde-containing solutions. Frozen specimens are generally superior for immunohistochemical staining and PCR. Routine histopathologic evaluation is performed on formalin-fixed tissues. Special stains can be used to maximize the identification of some infectious agents. The clinician should alert the histopathology laboratory to the infectious agents most suspected to allow for appropriate stain selection. Glutaraldehyde-containing fixatives are superior to other fixatives for electron microscopic examination of tissues, and this technique can be more sensitive than other procedures for demonstration of viral particles.",

PCR assays are used to amplify small quantities of DNA to detectable levels. By use of a reverse transcriptase (RT) step, RNA is converted to DNA, therefore the technique can also be used to detect RNA (RT-PCR). In general, PCR is more sensitive than cytologic or histopathologic techniques and is comparable with culture and laboratory animal inoculation. PCR assays are of great benefit for documentation of infections, particularly if the organism in question is difficult to culture (eg, respiratory Mycoplasma spp) or cannot be cultured (eg, hemoplasmas). Specificity can be very high, depending on the primers used in the reaction. For example, primers can be designed to detect one genus but not others. Primers can also be designed to identify only one species. For example, a PCR assay can be developed to detect all Ehrlichia spp or just one species, such as E. canis.",

False-negative results can occur if the sample is handled inappropriately; this is of particular importance for detection of some RNA viruses by RT-PCR. Results may also be affected by treatment, and it is therefore best to collect samples before administration of antimicrobial agents. Another potential problem is that minimal standardization exists among commercial laboratories offering PCR techniques, and results may therefore vary between laboratories. In addition, minimal external quality control exists and so the veterinary practitioner must trust that the laboratory providing the assay is using appropriate controls.",

            "text": "Although PCR assays can be one of the most sensitive for documentation of infections, positive test results do not always prove that the infection is resulting in clinical illness (low PPV). For example, because the technique detects DNA of both live and dead organisms, positive test results may be achieved even if the infection has been controlled. Interpretation of test results for a single animal can be difficult if the targeted organism commonly infects the background population of healthy animals. For example, \u201cCandidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\u201d DNA can be amplified from approximately 15% of all cats, whether anemic or healthy.8, 9 Thus, although PCR is the most sensitive way to document infection by this agent, the PPV is actually very low. In addition, currently available PCR assays cannot discriminate between vaccine and field strains for some agents. For example, currently available PCR assays for FHV-1 also amplify modified live vaccine strains, so a positive result does not even indicate presence of a pathogenic strain.10 Real-time PCR can be used to determine the amount of microbial DNA in a sample. It is possible that the DNA load will correlate to the presence of disease for some agents. Based on these findings, it is very important that small animal practitioners carefully assess the predictive values of currently available PCR assays as well as the expertise and reliability of the laboratory that will be performing the assays. New PCR assays are being developed frequently, but may not be required or optimal except for many canine and feline infectious disease agents. The clinical use of commonly available PCR assays will be discussed throughout this article.",

Based on these facts, falsely negative serum antibody tests during acute disease can be common in small animal practice. If specific serum antibody testing is initially negative in an animal with acute disease, repeat antibody testing should be performed in 2 to 3 weeks to assess for seroconversion.

In dogs, the hemoplasmas are generally only associated with disease if the dog is immunosuppressed. Diagnosis of hemoplasma infections in dogs and cats is based on demonstration of the organism on the surface of erythrocytes on examination of a thin blood film or PCR assay. Organism numbers fluctuate, and therefore blood film examination can be falsely negative >50% of the time.8 The organism may be difficult to find cytologically, particularly in the chronic phase. Thus, PCR assays are the tests of choice because of sensitivity, particularly if the cytological examination is negative. Both conventional and quantitative PCR assays are available and have similar sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Unfortunately, DNA copy numbers do not correlate to the presence of disease for the hemoplasmas. However, quantitative PCR assays can be used to monitor DNA copy numbers during antimicrobial drug research studies. Samples should be obtained for PCR assays before antibiotics. Treatment with doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone may be indicated if any of the agents are detected by PCR in cats or dogs with fever or anemia. Additionally, the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine recommends screening blood donor dogs or cats by hemoplasma PCR assays.14 There is minimal clinical utility after hemoplasma PCR assay results because most animals do not become negative with treatment.",

            "text": "Dogs in the United States are known to be infected by Ehrlichia canis, E. ewingii, E. chaffeensis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, A. platys, and Neorickettsia risticii.15 Each of these agents can result in fever and cytopenias, and the clinical syndrome is collectively known as ehrlichiosis. The primary agent in the United States is E. canis because of the distribution of Rhipicephalus sanguineous, whereas the prevalence of the other agents varies geographically. Cats may be infected by E. canis-like organisms as well as by A. phagocytophilum.16, 17 Little is known about the other agents in these genera in regards to cats; because the organisms are in different genera, serological cross reactivity is variable. Thus, although the clinical syndromes can be similar, there is no single serological test to document all the infections, and, other than the commercially available kit, there is no standardization among laboratories offering serology. In addition, some cats with E. canis-like infection do not seroconvert.16 Dogs and cats with ehrlichiosis can be clinically ill before seroconversion. Cytological assessment of blood smears is usually negative, and culture is expensive, has poor sensitivity, and is not readily available. Thus, PCR assays for Ehrlichia spp, Anaplasma spp, and perhaps N. risticii (atypical ehrlichiosis in dogs) should be performed on blood of dogs and cats with acute fever or cytopenias before treatment. PCR assays can be designed to amplify each individual organism and can be offered in panels. Alternately, primers are available to amplify all of the organisms in a single reaction, and subsequent sequencing can be used to determine the infective species. The predictive value of these PCR assays is currently unknown. However, it seems prudent to treat a clinically ill, PCR-positive dog or cat. Dogs with ehrlichiosis can be followed by PCR to prove cure; however, infection can reoccur, and so tick control should be maintained.15 Minimal information concerning the clinical use of repeated PCR testing of cats with these infections is available. Blood donors should be screened for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma/Neorickettsia and, if positive, excluded from the program even if treated because of the difficulty in sterilizing the blood.14\n",

Therefore, antibodies against R. rickettsii do not prove Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Cats can be infected by R. felis and have demonstrated antibodies against R. rickettsii. We assayed 92 pairs of cat blood and flea extracts from Alabama, Maryland, and Texas in a recent study in our laboratory; we used PCR assays that amplify a region of the citrate synthase gene and the outer membrane protein B gene.18 Of the 92 pairs, 62 of 92 (67.4%) flea extracts and none of the cat blood samples were positive for R. felis DNA. In another study, we identified R. felis and R. rickettsii antibody prevalence rates in cats with fever to be 5.6% and 6.6%, respectively; however, neither organism was amplified from blood.19 These results proved that cats were sometimes exposed, but further data are required to determine the significance of disease associations. Rickettsia spp DNA has been amplified from healthy dogs, but the infective species are currently unknown.20 The predictive values of Rickettsia spp PCR assays in clinical syndromes in dogs and cats have not been established.",

There are several other less common species that infect dogs and cats, and not all of the species induce cross-reacting antibodies. Thus, as for the Ehrlichia/Anaplasma/Neorickettsia group, PCR assays that amplify multiple Bartonella species can be superior to serology if collected before treatment. However, a combination of culture and PCR may be required to detect some infections in dogs.22 Serologic testing can be used to determine whether an individual dog or cat has been exposed; however, both seropositive and seronegative animals can be bacteremic, limiting the diagnostic use of serologic testing. Thus, testing healthy cats or dogs for Bartonella species infection is not currently recommended and should be reserved for those with suspected clinical bartonellosis. However, because Bartonella spp infection is so common in healthy animals, even positive-culture or PCR results do not prove clinical bartonellosis. For example, although we detected Bartonella spp DNA in more cats with fever than pair-matched cats without fever, the healthy cats were still commonly positive.23 Treatment usually does not permanently eliminate infection, and so there appears to be minimum clinical benefit to repeating PCR assays after successful treatment.",

Acid-fast staining of a thin fecal smear is cumbersome and insensitive, and antigen assays that are titrated for use with human feces are inaccurate when used with canine or feline feces. Immunofluorescent antibody staining of a thin fecal smear with a commercially available kit for the detection of C. parvum and G. lamblia in people appears to detect most Cryptosporidium spp and Giardia spp in dog and cat feces. This assay is commonly combined with fecal flotation by the author for the initial screening of cats with small bowel diarrhea and dogs with unexplained small bowel diarrhea that persists after routine therapeutic trials. PCR assays have been shown to be more sensitive than IFA for detection of C. felis in cats, but little is known about sensitivity in the dog.32 However, because of the inherent sensitivity, PCR assays are likely to detect a number of subclinical carriers, and so the PPV will be less than 100%.

Subclinical carriers are common, and therefore amplification of T. fetus DNA from feces does not always prove that the agent is the cause of the clinical disease (poor PPV).35 Treatment may not eliminate infection, and reinfection is common.

In dogs, canine coronavirus, canine distemper virus, and canine parvoviruses are most common. FeLV and FIV assays are generally performed on blood, not feces. Coronaviruses in dog and cat feces can be documented by electron microscopy, virus isolation, or molecular assays. RT-PCR can be used to detect FECV and FIPV RNA in feces of cats and canine coronavirus in feces of dogs. However, positive results do not prove feline infectious peritonitis in cats but merely the presence of a coronavirus.36 In addition, RT-PCR assay results cannot distinguish a cat or dog that is merely colonized with a coronavirus from one with diarrhea induced by a coronavirus. Enteric coronaviruses are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens with good husbandry and do not cause diarrhea in adults.6 Thus, there appears to be no reason to routinely perform coronavirus RT-PCR assay on the feces from a dog or cat. Feline panleukopenia virus and canine parvoviruses can be detected in dog and cat feces by electron microscopy, virus isolation, canine parvovirus antigen assays, and molecular diagnostic assays. There appears to be no reason to routinely perform parvovirus PCR assays on canine and feline feces because fecal antigen assays are widely available, easy to use, and detect current strains of canine and feline parvoviruses.4 Other organisms like astroviruses and reoviruses may infect some animals, but these agents have rarely been associated with disease. Thus, whether specific diagnostic assays for these agents are needed is unknown.",

Although B. bronchiseptica is a well-defined primary pathogen in dogs, the organism can be isolated from many clinically normal cats.37 Thus, the PPV of culture and PCR assay are low in cats. Bordetella bronchiseptica is easily grown, and culture is superior to PCR for this agent because antimicrobial susceptibility testing can be performed on isolates. The organism is not usually eliminated by treatment, and therefore posttherapeutic follow-up culture or PCR assay has minimal benefits. Chlamydophila felis is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of conjunctivitis and rhinitis, although it is not a common cause of lower airway disease. The organism is difficult to culture, and so detection of microbial DNA by PCR assays can be useful clinically. However, not all PCR-positive cats are clinically ill, and so the PPV can be low. PCR assays results can be used to prove a cattery has been cleared of the infection after treatment.38\nMycoplasma spp organisms are normal commensal organisms of the mucous membranes of multiple species including dogs and cats. Mycoplasma felis has been associated primarily with conjunctivitis in cats but is suspected as a primary cause of rhinitis in cats as well. There are multiple Mycoplasma spp of dogs and cats, and the pathogenic potential for most is unknown. If other primary diseases are present, even nonpathogenic Mycoplasma spp may be associated with the disease process.39, 40\nMycoplasma spp culture can be difficult, and antimicrobial susceptibility is not provided by most laboratories. Therefore, Mycoplasma spp PCR assays have at least moderate clinical utility. Genus-specific primers should probably be used because the pathogenic potential of all Mycoplasma spp is not known. However, the PPV of the assays is likely to be low because Mycoplasma spp are common flora. The organism is not usually eliminated by treatment, and so posttherapeutic follow-up culture or PCR assay has minimal benefit.",

Adenovirus 2, parainfluenza, influenza, respiratory coronavirus, canine distemper virus, and canine herpesvirus have the most potential to induce respiratory disease in dogs. There are many FCV, and mutations resulting in new strains are common.41 This organism is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of rhinitis, stomatitis, and conjunctivitis. FCV is less commonly associated with polyarthritis, lower airway disease in kittens, and virulent systemic disease.42 Virus isolation can be used to document current infection but takes at least several days for results to return and is not performed by all laboratories. Because of widespread exposure and vaccination, the PPV of serological tests is poor. RT-PCR assays can be used to amplify calicivirus RNA with quick and rapid return of results. However, these assays also amplify vaccine strains of FCV. Accordingly, FCV RNA can be amplified from samples collected from normal carrier cats as well as clinically ill cats, and therefore FCV RT-PCR assays may have poor PPV. For example, the presence of FCV RNA failed to correlate to the presence or absence of stomatitis in cats in a study from our laboratory.43 In addition, amplification of FCV RNA cannot be used to prove virulent systemic calicivirus infection. Results of FCV RT-PCR can also be falsely negative, and so assays may have poor NPV. Treatment does not eliminate FCV infection, and so there is no benefit to follow-up culture or RT-PCR testing.",

FHV-1 infection can be documented by direct fluorescent staining of conjunctival scrapings, virus isolation, or PCR. FHV-1 DNA can be amplified from conjunctival cells of approximately 25% of healthy cats, and therefore the PPV of PCR assay for this agent is low.44 Currently used PCR assays also detect vaccine strains of FHV-1, further lessening the PPV.10 In one study in the author's laboratory, presence of FHV-1 DNA failed to correlate to the presence or absence of stomatitis in cats.43 Quantitative PCR may ultimately prove to correlate to the presence or absence of disease but failed to correlate to presence of conjunctivitis in one study in the author's laboratory.45 The NPV of the FHV-1 PCR assays is also in question because many cats that are likely to have FHV-1\u2013associated disease are negative. This may relate to clearance of FHV-1 DNA from tissues by the immune reaction. Tissue biopsies have greater sensitivity than conjunctival swabs. FHV-1 DNA can be amplified from aqueous humor of some cats, but whether this indicates FHV-1 associated uveitis is unknown.46 Treatment does not eliminate FHV-1 infection, and so there is no benefit to follow-up culture or PCR testing.",
