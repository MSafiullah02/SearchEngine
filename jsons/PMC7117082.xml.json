Clinicians are recommended to first test for the most likely and \u201ccan't miss\u201d pathogens for a given patient, knowing the optimal test to use for each pathogen. If these first-line tests are unrevealing, saved cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be used for follow-up testing. The diagnostic plan should be in place prior to obtaining a lumbar puncture (LP), so that all desired first-line tests are sent, and no extraneous tests use precious CSF. Specific recommendations from the International Encephalitis Consortium include: record the LP opening pressure; collect at least 20 cc of CSF; save 5 to 10 cc for future testing; and test all CSF samples for glucose (along with paired peripheral glucose), protein, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, and red blood cell count.\n1\nThe importance of collecting a large volume of CSF and asking the clinical laboratory to save a portion of it cannot be underestimated. This facilitates additional workup after the most common causes of infection are ruled out, and prevents the need for a repeat LP and interpretation of results confounded by anti-infective and anti-inflammatory treatments.\n",

Baseline serum should also be stored for future testing, since some infections are diagnosed by testing acute and convalescent (4\u20136 weeks) sera. Above all, close bidirectional communication with the clinical pathologists in the microbiology and chemistry laboratories is paramount to ensure that the optimal diagnostic assays are chosen and that tests are followed up in a timely fashion.\n",

The classic teaching that viral pathogens lead to a predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis while bacterial etiologies result in a neutrophilic predominance and low glucose is an oversimplification of a dynamic process with significant overlap. For example, in a pediatric series of 158 patients, neutrophilic predominant CSF had a positive predictive value of 81% and a negative predictive value of just 3% for distinguishing bacterial from viral meningitis.\n3\nConversely, 8 out of 82 patients with meningococcal meningitis had a normal CSF WBC count.\n4\nDespite this, certain patterns can be useful to guide further testing, particularly when first-line testing is uninformative. Examples include the moderately low CSF glucose levels typical of mumps and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and the persistent neutrophilic pleocytosis found with West Nile virus (WNV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV).\n5\nAn eosinophilic pleocytosis should raise concern for helminth infections.

Late neurosyphilis can present as meningovascular involvement with seizures and a stroke-like syndrome, or parenchymal involvement with tabes dorsalis and general paresis.\n33\nAtypical presentations include a temporal lobe encephalitis that can mimic herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis.\n34\nSyphilis is diagnosed by serology. First, screening is performed using a serum treponemal test: fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS),\nT. pallidum\nparticle agglutination (TP-PA), or an antitreponemal ELISA. All of these are useful for diagnosing syphilis at any stage but remain positive for life, regardless of treatment. If negative, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis can be ruled out. If positive, nontreponemal tests are used to confirm active infection and monitor treatment response. The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and the rapid plasma reagin tests assess for antibodies that react with endogenous antigens (lecithin, cholesterol, and cardiolipin). Neurosyphilis can be diagnosed by CSF VDRL, which has a specificity of 99.8% but a sensitivity of only 30 to 68%.\n35\n36\nOther tests performed from CSF have low sensitivity, including PCR\n37\nand FTA-ABS and ELISA,\n38\nthough TP-PA may be more promising.\n39\nTherefore, even if CSF VDRL is negative, patients with positive syphilis serology, CSF pleocytosis, and compatible symptoms can be treated presumptively for neurosyphilis.\n",

It cannot identify many pathogens that commonly affect neurosurgical and severely immunocompromised patients, and it does not include regional pathogens such as\nBorrelia\n,\nCoccidioides\n, and WNV. In addition, careful consideration must be given to pathogens associated with chronic infection and reactivation, such as herpesviruses, since detecting their presence does not always indicate pathogenesis. For example, Green et al\n78\nreviewed 15 patients with HHV-6 detected by FA-MEP, and determined that in only one patient was the clinical syndrome likely attributable to HHV-6; in two patients, HHV-6 was a possible culprit, while in the other 12 it was deemed unlikely to play a causative role. Finally, it remains unclear how to interpret the clinical significance of multiple potential pathogens in a single sample. For all of the above reasons, microbe-specific testing should be performed for confirmation in the setting of unexpected positive or negative results. It is incumbent upon clinical laboratories to provide assistance in reviewing results to avoid errors in clinical decision making.\n",

In this technique, all nucleic acid in a sample is sequenced simultaneously using a \u201cshotgun\u201d approach, and the resulting unbiased sequencing reads are depleted of human reads, then compared with reference databases to identify potential pathogens. Metagenomic sequencing libraries can be created directly from DNA to identify eukaryotes, bacteria, and DNA viruses. To detect RNA viruses, RNA is first reverse transcribed to complementary DNA using random primers, and metagenomic sequencing libraries are generated. These methods are depicted in\nFig. 1\nand described in greater detail in several recent reviews.\n105\n106\n",

            "text": "\nAs metagenomic sequencing moves into clinical practice, it is becoming increasingly important to define its test characteristics, both through detailed use of negative controls to define specificity, as well as validation studies to definite sensitivity. Validation for metagenomic sequencing is challenging because, unlike traditional tests, there are a multitude of possible outcomes, and it is not possible to validate every potential pathogen. It is has therefore been proposed to validate a subset of organisms representing different general characteristics (e.g., viruses with different genome structures, or bacteria with different cell-wall types) using samples from patients with confirmed infection, as well as mock samples created both in vitro and in silico.\n134\nThis approach has been described for CSF as well as respiratory samples, with report of overall sensitivity on the order of 70% and specificity >90%.\n134\nUsing mock samples, the limit of detection for various organisms has been estimated to range between 10 to 100 copies/mL for viruses, on the order of 10 CFU/mL for bacteria, and between 0.01 and >100 CFU/mL for fungi.\n134\n",

There is likely variability in these factors not only between types of pathogens (e.g., enterovirus versus WNV), but also between specific pathogens of the same type in different hosts (e.g., WNV in immunocompetent vs. immunocompromised patients). Factors that can contribute to low specificity include contamination from organisms on the patient's skin, microbe components present in reagents, or contamination from the laboratory environment or other samples included on the same sequencing run. False positives can also result from computational analysis, if there is poor specificity in the computational pipeline (e.g., classifying bacteria only to the level of genus) or misclassifications in the reference database.",

This is also an active area of interest for industry, and it is likely that metagenomic sequencing will take on an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Given the limitations described above, applying the results from metagenomic sequencing in clinical practice should involve careful interpretation in the context of a specific patient. For organisms not yet validated, confirmatory testing using a standard assay should be employed when possible. Currently, metagenomic sequencing is most often used as a \u201clast resort\u201d in patients in whom extensive other testing has been unrevealing. It is important to consider whether this would be more fruitful as a front-line test, where it could potentially replace standard PCR for common pathogens, detect rare pathogens without extensive additional workup, and perhaps have higher yield when applied to higher quality (i.e., fresh) specimens.\n",

Broad-range testing offers the exciting opportunity to detect many potential pathogens at once, and is expected to improve the overall rate of diagnosis for patients with CNS infection. However, the test characteristics and cost-benefit ratio of these methods are still being evaluated.
