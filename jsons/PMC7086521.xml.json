One hypothesis is that viral infection produces remodeling of the submucosa, generating susceptibility in nerves and triggering subsequent mast-cell activation associated with a maintained production and release of leukotrienes.33",

A deregulation of innate antiviral host defense based on eosinophils is another theory linking bronchiolitis and subsequent development of wheezing.35 Although no statistically significant difference in PGE2 levels was found between samples, the remarkably lower levels in the wheezing group during the acute infection are no less noteworthy. We hypothesized that recurrent wheezing development after a severe bronchiolitis may be related not only to maintained elevated LTC4 levels, but rather to the lower PGE2 levels during the acute infection, as PGE2 can exert anti-inflammatory effects on lower airway inflammation.36",

This pro-inflammatory response was likely mediated by activation of the TLR3\u2013NF-\u03baB pathway.
