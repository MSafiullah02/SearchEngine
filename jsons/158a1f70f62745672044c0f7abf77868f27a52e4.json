It is also a crisis for education: how can teaching and learning proceed as normal in such an abnormal world? Presence is fundamental to the interpersonal relationships that underpin education, and which cannot be replaced by use of technology. Yet, if we have always accepted correspondence and home schooling as viable alternatives for families under certain circumstances, such as living in remote locations or as a matter of political/religious preference, there is a logical argument that such arrangements could feasibly become the 'new normal' of schooling.",

The neoliberal tendency towards 'presentism' engenders an amnesia that denies access to history for explaining the reasons for current conditions. But the expansion of economistic thinking to the entire planetary system, on which the current form of neoliberalism is based, also denies access to modes of thought that would prepare for possible futures (such as so-called 'black swan' events), based on realistic estimations of human behaviour and motivation. 'Access denied' refers to the denial of the full spectrum of human cognition and creativity in the genres and frameworks available to scholars and thinkers of all stripes, under globalised neoliberal policy conditions.",

'Presentism', which supports the contemporary focus on short-term profits, exacerbated by accounting practices, electoral cycles, even newspaper deadlines, ignores the long-term, historical effects of major events like the current pandemic. The Black Death of the fourteenth century had huge economic results, effectively ending the feudal system in much of Europe. There had been cracks in the system beforehand, but the Black Death, by altering the relationship between employer and labourer, speeded its uneven demise. Although serfdom did not cease in Russia until the nineteenth century, through most of Western Europe, the financial relationships between aristocracy and labourer were forever altered. What analogous results might arise from this pandemic? Will the social and financial status of frontline essential workers through the pandemic-nurses, health assistants, grocery workers-be improved?",

Will we experience something similar to this reaction? Is the now widespread acceptance of the role of technology and its accompanying surveillance a likely outcome of this experience? What will be the spatial effects of 'stay in place'? Will we head towards some kind of intellectual cottage industries, somewhat like the early industrial revolution, with the computer replacing the spinning wheel, as big employers such as universities see the possibility of not providing space or equipment to white collar workers?",

            "text": "A favourite story from the Black Death is that of the village of Eyam, a tiny spot in Derbyshire, which locked itself up when it found the plague in its midst, in order to prevent spreading it to neighbouring villages. Eyam paid a huge toll itself, but won the eternal gratitude of its neighbours-and, incidentally, made a living for itself centuries later, by capitalising on the tourists fascinated by its history. It seems Aotearoa New Zealand could become the Eyam of the twenty-first century, but by providing an example of good leadership and effective use of science and scientists, rather than by sacrificing itself. This exemplary pandemic response in itself is a tribute to the quality of our education system that has evolved over the last 200 years. We have an educated population, despite the presence of a few 'idiots'-and an educated leadership. Our ability to pull together is a priceless result.",
