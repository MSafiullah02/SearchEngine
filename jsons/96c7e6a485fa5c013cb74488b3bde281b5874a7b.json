Based on a Pangolin classification system (Database version 27 April 2020), they are grouped into A, B.1, B.1.5 and B.4 lineages (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1) [9, 12]. Considering the origins and lineage branches, these SARS-CoV-2 lineages are likely to have recent ancestors outside Thailand. For example, six of the samples in the B.1 lineage in our collection are grouped tightly with virus samples commonly found in the United States of America and Europe and collected during the same period (March 2020) as visualized by Nextstrain Timetree (Supplementary Figure 2). The constructed Bayesian tree displayed the similar structure to that of the maximum-likelihood approach (Supplementary Figure 3). It is worth noting the local expansion of a putative Thai specific lineage (Figure 2). This cluster of viruses has passed the criteria of a novel lineage as follows: (a) exhibits two shared nucleotide differences from the ancestral lineage [cut point \u2265 1], (b) contains 11 genomes with > 95% of the genome sequenced [cut point \u2265 5], (c) exhibits one shared nucleotide change (27,877G\u2192U) among the ongoing transmission groups from March 2020 [cut point \u2265 1], and (d) has 99% bootstrap value for the lineage defining node [cut point > 70%]",

Among the changes, 20,134G\u2192U mutation has been independently found in two samples in lineage B.1 from the Netherlands and USA. It remains to be determined with a larger sample size whether this is the result of convergent evolution or genetic recombination. This pattern of homoplasy was also hypothetically linked to putative RNA editing[13].Thailand/Bangkok-0018, a sample in the A/Thai-1 lineage, contains a 4-nt frame-shift deletion at position 27,694-27,697, causing a premature truncation in ORF7a, which now contains five altered amino acid residues and loses the 16 original C-terminal residues (Figure 3). The deletion was confirmed by Sanger sequencing twice using two independent RT-PCR reactions (Supplementary Figure 5). The frame-shift mutation alters approximately one-sixth (21/121 residues) of the ORF7a protein. Based on protein homology to SARS-CoV, the missing region corresponds to a transmembrane helix and an ER retrieval motif, required for antagonizing a host antiviral factor [14, 15]. One sample from Arizona, USA also contains an 81-nt in-frame deletion in the ORF7a gene [16]. So far, only one sample in A/Thai-1 appears to have this frame-shift deletion. It is tempting to speculate on the relationship between ORF7a deletions and virus attenuation. However, further investigations by laboratory-based functional experiments are needed before reaching any conclusion on their biological and clinical significance.",
