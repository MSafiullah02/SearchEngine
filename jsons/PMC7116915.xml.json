SARS originated in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong in mid-November 2002. Almost 3 months later, on February 11, 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Health reported that there had been 300 cases of SARS, five of them fatal, in the province (BBC News, 2003). Meanwhile, a physician from Guangdong Province who had treated patients with the atypical pneumonia visited Hong Kong and stayed at a hotel, infecting at least six other guests (Chien and Law, 2003; Pine and McKercher, 2004). The infected people carried the disease to Singapore, Vietnam, Canada, Thailand, and Taiwan. The doctor who was identified as the carrier died at a hospital in Hong Kong on March 2, 2003.",

Ninety percent of the cases in Taiwan were related to healthcare settings, so more than 150 doctors and nurses left their jobs to protest the lack of safeguards (BBC News, 2003).",

Thousands of business meetings and vacations were cancelled (Economist, 2003). Conference calls and travels to neighboring tourism destinations by cars became the norm. SARS had an immediate and devastating impact on Taiwan's hotel industry (Taipei Times, 2003d). The situation was exacerbated when hotels offered discounts and special promotions in the midst of a sharp business decline, which had been triggered by the spread of the SARS. For example, the Ambassador Hotel Taipei charged New Taiwan Dollar (NT$) 3300 for a room, over 50 percent below the regular rate of NT$6800 (China Post, 2003b).",

However, most economic impact studies focused on the demands of vacationers and business travelers, not on the reaction of stock investors or of the stock market. Thus, there is a niche for further research to examine the impact of the disease on the financial performance of hotel firms. It is important to investigate the magnitude of the SARS\u2019 impact not only through its effects on tourist-related industries but also through the stock market's reactions. This study analyzes the impact of SARS on stock prices of publicly traded hotel companies in Taiwan. The objective of this study is to examine whether or not SARS had a significant influence on the stock price movements of Taiwanese hotel companies. This study will shed light on the impact of this serious disease on hotel stock prices and prepare businesses for the similar epidemics.",

Some doctors blamed the government for the growing public panic, claiming that its draconian anti-SARS measures have only undermined attempts to control the disease. For example, Taipei officials proposed an automatic 3-day quarantine for anyone with a fever. The Department of Health banned the sale of anti-fever pills at drugstores in hopes of encouraging possible SARS sufferers consult their doctors. Most Taipei roads were gridlocked by 7:00 a.m., since a government order that required all subway and train passengers to wear masks caused commuters to avoid using public transportation.",

However, due to the plunge in travel and business meetings, following the outbreak of SARS, the average occupancy rate of local five-star hotels fell from the normal 70 percent to less than 30 percent (China Post, 2003b). Several hotels catering to Japanese visitors, the primary international tourist market, lost as much as half of their Japanese bookings, and resorted to a price reduction program to lure more tourists, thus resulting in an even greater loss of their sales revenue. Thus, many hotels tried to cut costs by closing unoccupied floors or ordering employees to take unpaid leave (China Post, 2003c).",

However, the OLS residuals in the market model usually failed to satisfy the basic assumptions of the linear regression, especially the assumption of homoscedasticity that the distribution of the OLS residuals has a constant variance. Many studies pointed out that the standard tests to measure the effect of a specific event on stock prices must be adjusted due to the presence of heteroskedasticity (Giaccoto and Ali, 1982; Akgiray, 1989; Corhay and Tourani Rad, 1994). These studies showed that Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) model developed by Engle (1982) and Generalized ARCH (GARCH) model developed by Bollerslev (1986) could address the empirical characteristics of stock return series. Diebold et al. (1988) observed that residuals obtained using the standard market model exhibit strong ARCH properties and Bera et al. (1988) showed that market model estimates under GARCH processes are more efficient. Therefore, we used the market model under GARCH process (MM-GARCH) as alternative model to model the conditional variance of hotel stock returns. The MM-GARCH (p, q) can be depicted as(10)Rj,t=\u03b1j+\u03b2jRm,t+\u03b5j,t,\n(11)\u03b5j,t|\u03a9t-1\u223cN(0,hj,t),\n(12)hj,t=cj+\u2211i=1q\u03bbj,i\u03b5j,t-i2+\u2211k=1p\u03b3j,khj,t-k,where ht is the conditional variance of errors \u03b5t conditional on the information set available at day t\u22121, \u03a9t-1; q is the number of lags of \u03b5t and p is the number of lags of ht; parameters \u03bb and \u03b3 denote the sensitivity of ht to the lags of square \u03b5t and ht itself, respectively.

Due to the large decrease in leisure and business visitors, the occupancy rates of five-star hotels dropped by as much as 40 percent and average room rates also plummeted during the SARS outbreak. To offset the dramatic losses of revenue, most hotel management adopted cost-reduction strategies: closing some floors, reducing operating hours of food and beverage facilities, asking employees to take non-paid leave, and stopping all overtime payments (Pine and McKercher, 2004).",

Due to the widespread global panic about SARS and intensive news coverage, the catastrophic event could result in an irrational market response (e.g., a sell-off, a panic, or a contagion effect). A contagion effect prevails in case that unpredictability concerning some stocks is transferred to other stocks in the same or related industry. Among different segments of the tourism industry, stock prices of hotels could have immediate negative reaction right after the SARS outbreak, and other industry segments such as restaurant, travel agency, rental car companies could also be directly exposed to significantly negative stock market returns. The influence of the SARS outbreak on the tourism industry was quickly assimilated into declining stock prices in reality. Thus, accompanied by a sharp decline in sales revenue and cash flow due to significant decrease in occupancy and average daily rate, a widespread panic caused stakeholders who invested in hotels to perceive higher risk and to require higher rate of return for their investment in Taiwan. Therefore, hotel investors considered their stocks over-valued, resulting in sell-off of their stocks.",

Thus, in order to minimize the possible negative impact on the firm's financial performance or stock prices if a similar epidemic like the bird-flu occurs, hotel management in Taiwan and other South-East Asian countries should prepare preventive remedies to improve the stock market's negative response to the crisis. Top management should sustain the confidence level of hotel investors by reducing their uncertainty of hotel stocks in the market; thus an irrational market response such as panic or stock sell-offs may not be as severe or durable as before. Thus, it may be important for hotel management to widely advertise, on the occurrence of a similar disease, that the abnormal impact would be a temporary phenomenon as evidenced in this study.",
