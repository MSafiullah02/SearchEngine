Infants are more vulnerable to respiratory viral infections with approximately six to eight infections per year [Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010]. Most of these infections are confined to the upper respiratory tract (URT) leading to symptoms of common cold, coryza, and cough and are often accompanied by fever with fatigue and loss of appetite in some cases. Approximately, one third of infants with respiratory viral infections develop lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms that may lead to bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and severe respiratory distress [Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010].",

Positive controls for the respiratory viruses were kindly donated by Addenbrooke's hospital clinical microbiology laboratory, Cambridge, UK.

The reaction was initiated by a reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 30 min followed by an amplification cycle with the following conditions: a cycle of 95\u00b0 C for 15 min, then 45 cycles of 15 sec at 95\u00b0 C, and 1 min at 60\u00b0C with subsequent acquiring of the appropriate fluorescence reading.",

Of the total 236 samples collected from MGH, 70% of patients were infected by at least one virus; which is consistent with the high rate observed worldwide [Liu et al., 2014; Mengelle et al., 2014; Ouedraogo et al., 2014]. The positivity rate for any microbial agent may possibly be higher since undiagnosed infection could be positive for bacterial infections that were not included in the screening panel. Existing pathogens may include Streptococcus pneumonia, Bordatella pertussis, mycoplasma penumoniae, Chlamydia peneumonia, and Legionella pneumophila [File et al., 1998]. Thus, introducing these bacteria to the panel may improve the detection rate of bacterial single infection or bacterial and viral co\u2010infections.",

In our study, the prevalence of Flu A (5%) was higher than Flu B (2%), with the predominance of H3N2 (83%) in hospitalized children. Zaraket et al. [2014] studied virus prevalence in all age groups and previously reported that H3N2 virus predominated in Lebanon during the 2011\u20132012 seasons. However, a year before, both 2009 pandemic H1N1 and B viruses co\u2010circulated with equal prevalence [Zaraket et al., 2014].

RSV and hMPV were often causing lower respiratory tract infection. From all samples tested, we frequently detected RSV that infected infants less than 1\u2010year old suggesting that these children may lack passively acquired immunity from their mother or the antibodies were not effective in preventing the infection. A comparable prevalence of RSV was previously reported in 2008 in the northern part of Lebanon (26.7%), in Turkey (20%), and in Jordan (34%) [Bdour, 2001; Kanra et al., 2005; Hamze et al., 2010].",

Therefore, identifying the pathogenic role of these viruses on the disease severity of the patients is challenging. It was previously documented that viruses may be persistent in asymptomatic individuals who may be also shedding in the nasal secretion for 11 days, 3 weeks and 6 months in hRV, RSV, and hBoV infections, respectively [van Benten et al., 2003; von Linstow et al., 2008; Blessing et al., 2009; Peltola et al., 2013; Piedimonte and Perez, 2014]. The high rate of co\u2010infections led us to explore the association between the presence of multiple viruses and severity of symptoms. According to our results and in accordance with previous studies, we found no differences in clinical severity between patients hospitalized with single infection and those with viral co\u2010infection [Aberle et al., 2005; Paranhos\u2010Baccala et al., 2008; Asner et al., 2014]. However, a previous study conducted by Semple et al. [2005] demonstrated that coinfection with both hMPV and RSV increase by 10\u2010fold the risk of admission for intensive care unit and the use for mechanical ventilation. This hypothesis could not be applied in our study since only one child was infected with both viruses and was not admitted to ICU for ventilation.",

In our study, we used nasal and throat swabs instead of nasopharyngeal swab, which is a more invasive procedure with a higher sensitivity [Do et al., 2011].
