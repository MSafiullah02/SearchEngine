A (first?) peak of the Danish outbreak was reached around April 1, 2020 and is and presently, in mid-April 2020, on the way down (https://politi.dk/coronavirus-i-danmark/in-english). NOH follows national infection control guidelines for COVID-19 from National Board of Health (www.sst.dk).",

The frontline staff at NOH predominately expressed fear of not being sufficiently protected from infection when using personal protection equipment (PPE). This problem was hospital wide but particularly pronounced at the COVID cohort wards since the workflow was new and unfamiliar and the exposure intense. Accordingly, a new and unusual collaboration between an infection prevention and control nurse and a psychologist was initiated. An inductive change strategy (bottom-up) addressing staffs fear and anxiety was used in the attempt to release defense mechanisms blocking rational thinking and change of behavior. The Intervention was based on Edgar H. Schein\u2019s Process Consultation and how to help people change [6,7]. The psychologist acted as a process facilitator and the infection prevention and control nurse acted as a teacher during the process. Facilitation was combined with psychoeducation in coping strategies towards fear and high level of stress, and the education focused primarily on recalling staffs existing knowledge of infection prevention and secondly on how to use PPE correctly. So far, this new approach has been used in five sessions comprising 20 nurses and 15 physicians. The response from staff has been overwhelmingly positive. Most were relieved that their worries were acknowledged and became eager to discuss different scenarios of virus transmission. Many were reassured of their professional ability to risk assess behavior when close to patients with COVID-19 and began trusting their knowledge of infection prevention and correct use of PPE.",
