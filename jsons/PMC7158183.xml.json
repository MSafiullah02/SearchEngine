After the foundation of People\u2019s Republic of China in 1950s, the government paid attention to the cancer control problem. At the end of 1955, under the auspices of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the international conference on antibiotics was held in Beijing2 and the task of investigating new anticancer antibiotics was proposed by some scientists. In 1956, a 12-year plan (1956\u20131967) for the advancement of science and technology in China was initiated and anticancer drug research was also included. Many units affiliated with research institutions, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, as well as hospitals, began to join in this research program. At the end of 1958, the movement of the Great Leap Forward encouraged people to search methods and drugs for combating cancer, which was considered a very dangerous disease and a very difficult research problem. Since then, the massive screening of Chinese medicinal herbs and folk remedies for cancer treatment was spread. After cooperative work, some effective agents for certain kinds of cancer patients were proved. Meanwhile in Beijing, the National Bureau for cancer prevention and treatment, affiliated with the Ministry of Health of the People\u2019s Republic of China was organized. It consisted of more than 10 branch organizations, one of which was a cooperative group of anticancer drug research, and Dr. B. Xu was appointed as a head of this group. In order to organize collaborative tasks and exchange information of varying antitumor agents, periodic meetings and conferences were held in different cities in China. For instance, the National Conference of Tumor Pharmacology and Chemotherapy was begun at that time and continued up to recent years. Some records of these conferences may be seen in Table 12.1\n.",

After joint efforts of different units, a number of therapeutic drugs were studied in detail both experimentally and clinically. Some of them were recommended for clinical use and production. New anticancer drugs commonly used in other countries were also investigated in China using native material and methods such as alkaloids from Vinca rosea, nitrogen mustard derivatives, antimetabolites, and others (at that time China was isolated from abroad). In this period, which was thought to be the early stage of anticancer drug research in China, many specialists in this area gained much knowledge and experience and also learned a great deal from foreign literature. Meanwhile, the fundamental basis of research, education, and production of anticancer drugs was established.",

New disciplines such as cell kinetics, molecular tumor pharmacology, standard evaluation procedures of new anticancer agents both in the laboratory and clinic, efficient screening methods and qualified clinical trials, combination chemotherapy for different cancers, and so forth were introduced to China. Some leading institutions in this field such as the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica (SIMM), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the Institute of Materia Medica at Beijing (IMM), the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology of Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Shanghai Institutes of Pharmaceutical Industry, Institute of Antibiotics in Beijing, Tumor Hospitals located in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou all played an important role in raising the level of cancer chemotherapy in Chinese practice and actively making exchange of knowledge for searching and producing new antitumor drugs. Within a short period of time, the majority of well-known anticancer preparations in the world could be already produced in China and satisfied clinical needs. Some drugs, including a number of China\u2019s own developed agents, were exported to other countries such as vinca alkaloids, camptothecins, and so on. Table 12.2\nshows the basic antitumor drugs used clinically at that time. It also meant that the most popular antitumor agents could be manufactured and supplied by Chinese pharmaceutical companies.",

Based on new findings and by means of new methods and techniques, many new drugs including cytostatic agents, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, anti-signal transduction drugs, antineoplastic antibodies, differentiation-inducing agents, new generations of antimetabolites, and cytotoxic agents have been developed. Some Chinese research laboratories and pharmaceutical plants actively take part in collaborative work with foreign pharmaceutical companies and other organizations; many new findings and drug preparations already have been discovered. At present, nearly all new anticancer drugs can be found in Chinese pharmaceutical markets and clinical hospitals. Thousands of scientific papers related to investigation and production of different antitumor agents are published in journals, books, or online in network annually by Chinese specialists. Many important contributions in this field can be found through different channels. Here, we will review some achievements obtained in China which are more closely related to our work (Table 12.3, Table 12.4\n).",

Its antitumor effect was stronger than actinomycin C. After toxicological and mechanistic studies, actinomycin K was recommended for clinical trials. Clinical data showed that this antibiotic exerted remarkable therapeutic effect for choriocarcinoma and malignant lymphoma. Afterwards, actinomycin K was approved for manufacture named Gengshengmeisu. Later work showed that actinomycin K consisted of two components, K1 and K2, K1 being a new substance (in very little amount), while K2 was identified with actinomycin D, which was confirmed as an antitumor agent in the US at the same time. After several years, the purified actinomycin K produced in Chinese pharmaceutical factories was equal to actimomycin D and provided for clinical use.",

At that time, the researchers in SIMM paid much attention to this tree isolating different active principles from its bark, trunk, leaves, and fruits, and testing their antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. From 1970 to 1974 several investigators in the US reported that camptothecin could cause severe bladder toxicity and weak therapeutic effect,11 thus the drug was dropped from clinical trials. In our laboratory, we persisted in this study, finding some antidotes for the toxicity. Meanwhile, we found that 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT)12 isolated from the fruits of this tree possessed higher antitumor activity and lower toxicity than camptothecin. After a series of studies, HCPT was put into production for clinical use. When we reported such results at international conferences and published a series of papers related to hydroxycamptothecin, new attention was paid to the analogs of camptothecin, promoting novel investigations of its derivatives. In the last 20 years, irinotecan (CPT-11) and topotecan, the analogs of hydroxycamptothecin have become more popular anticancer drugs widely used in tumor hospitals in different countries. It is already known13 that the active metabolite of CPT-11 is 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin or SN38 that possesses much higher potency (more than 100 times) than CPT-11. It suggests that a great potential of exploring better drugs than HCPT exists and more work should be pursued. In China, HCPT as a basic common anticancer drug produced by several pharmaceutical companies has been used clinically for different cancer patients mainly with gastrointestinal carcinoma, tumors of the head and neck with marked therapeutic effect.14 But some investigators pointed out that the lactone-ring opened form of HCPT, i.e., its sodium preparation, should be inactive. According to our experimental data,15 both lactone-ring closed and opened forms of HCPT were effective against tumor growth, the latter being less potent, but it could be converted into closed form under certain conditions.",

It is already known that the cytotoxic action of HN2 bears some relation to the chemical reactivity of the chlorine atoms of the mustard grouping. We postulated that the high chemical reactivity of ocaphane might be related to the chlorine atom; an introduction of electronegative group such as nitro group into the benzene ring could possibly deactivate the mustard grouping. Thus, AT-1258 (nitrocaphane), 2-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-aminomethyl-5-nitro-phenylalanine was synthesized and compared with AT-581 in respect to their antitumor activity and toxicity. The experimental data revealed that AT-1258 had remarkable therapeutic effect on different animal tumors better than AT-581.43., 44., 45. The intraperitoneal injection of 4 mg/kg of AT-1258 produced 82\u201399% inhibition of Ehrlich solid carcinoma and solid hepatoma in mice. The therapeutic effect was nearly the same when it was given orally at 8\u201310 mg/kg. In rats bearing 5- to 6-day-old Jensen sarcoma with 2\u20135 cm2 of tumor mass, AT-1258 produced tumor regression in a majority of the rats 12\u201315 days after seven injections of the drug, the cure rate being 62\u201386%. When nitrocaphane and ocaphane were used at the same tolerated dose, ocaphane (2 mg/kg) caused 67% and nitrocaphane (4 mg/kg) 96% (p<0.01) of tumor inhibition in mice bearing Ehrlich carcinoma. Nitrocaphane at 1.5 mg/kg inhibited Brown\u2013Pearce carcinoma in 66\u201378% of rabbits inoculated intraocularly, but the inhibition caused by ocaphane was only 49\u201365%. Both drugs prolonged the survival of rabbits (from 110% to 120%) when the tumor was inoculated intravenously. The experiments with 14C-nitrocaphane showed that the radioactivity was distributed throughout many internal organs after oral administration. The highest content of 14C was noted in the kidney, intestine, liver, tumor, and lung. In normal rats, the biological half-life of the drug in plasma was about 13 min. It was excreted mainly in the urine and feces, 65% of the total being excreted within 24 h.",

In order to search for better drugs, Ren46 at SIMM synthesized biomolane (1,2-bis (4-morpholinomethyl-3,5-dioxypiperazin-l-yl) ethane), a new compound, and found that it possessed a definite therapeutic effect against lymphoma, breast carcinoma, and other tumors. It was also used for treatment of patients with psoriasis or uveitis.47., 48. Probimane (1,2-bis (N4-morpholinomethyl-3,5-dioxopiperazin-l-yl) propane; designated as AT-2153 or MST-02), an analog of bimolane, was discovered to have better antitumor action than bimolane.49., 50. It produced marked antitumor action on Lewis lung carcinoma, B16 melanoma, colon adenocarcinoma 38, and hepatoma in mice, and was also active against spontaneous lymphoma and human bronchial adenocarcinoma heterotransplanted into nude mice. Moreover, it exhibited a potentiating effect to irradiation against sarcoma 37 and S-180 in mice. It did not show mutagenic activity in Ames test. 14C-labeled probimane studies showed that it was easily absorbed in oral administration and widely distributed in the majority of tissues. Probimane was excreted mainly in urine and partly in feces. When 14C was labeled at central dioxopiperazine or methyl morpholine group of probimane and injected intravenously in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma by whole body autoradiography, the drug was broken into at least two parts: a central part and a methyl morpholine group. The central part of the compound hardly penetrated through the blood\u2013brain barrier but accumulated in the urinary bladder. The methyl morpholine group revealed a high affinity to tumor tissue and accumulated in spleen, bone, and liver.51 In mice bearing tumors, probimane could decrease the serum sialic acid level that was thought to be related to its anti-metastatic effect.52 After long-term administration of bimolane, the incidence of acute leukemia in several cases was reported, thus biomolane was stopped. Ren and Cai designed and prepared many analogs of probimane, among them MST-16 (4,4\u0384-(1,2-ethanediyl)-bis(1-isobutoxycarbonyloxymethyl-2-6-piperazinedione) or sobuzoxane) was found to be the best one and was studied in detail.50., 51., 52., 53., 54., 55. In cooperation with Japanese colleagues, sobuzoxane was subjected to systematic preclinical and clinical studies. It was proved that this drug was effective for treatment of leukemia and lymphoma patients.56., 57., 58. At present, sobuzoxane has obtained approval in Japan for clinical use and production. It can be administered orally and can ameliorate the toxicity induced by doxorubicin59 that is useful for combination therapy.",

            "text": "In cancer chemotherapy, antimony compounds were little studied in comparison with other metal anticancer drugs. In 1960s, at SIMM a systematic investigation was conducted on the antitumor action of antimony and other metal chelating compounds. Chou et al.60 designed and synthesized several classes of these compounds including (1) various salts of Sb-EDTA chelating agents; (2) N-substituted analogs of antimonial chelate of ethylene diaminetriacetic acid (EDTA); (3) metal chelates of EDTA; (4) analogs of antimonial chelate of propylene diamine tetraacetic acid (PDTA); (5) metal chelates of ammonia triacetic acid (ATA); (6) chelating agents to ATA; (7) antimonial chelates related to ATA; (8) antimonial chelates of ATA analogs; (9) nickel and copper complexes of methionine; (10) chelating agents (e.g., EDTA, PDTA, ATA). After screening and pharmacological studies, 61 we found that (1) the chelates of 10 metals including Hg, Bi, Pb Zn, Mn, Cu, Co, Ni, Sn, Ba, and EDTA, PDTA, and ATA had no antitumor activity on Ehrlich carcinoma; (2) complexones of several metals did not inhibit the growth of sarcoma 180 in mice; (3) several aminocarboxylic complexones of antimony could produce marked inhibition on animal tumors. Among tested compounds, Sb-71 (antimony ammonia triacetic acid) and Sb-57 (antimony sodium PDTA) were found to have better therapeutic action on a number of experimental tumors.62 Both compounds significantly prolonged the survival time of mice bearing Ehrlich ascites carcinoma or spindle cell sarcoma and obviously retarded the growth of Guerin carcinoma in rats with 58\u201370% inhibition. Sb-71 also exerted therapeutic effect against sarcoma 180. Experimental results showed that Sb-71 inhibited all four stages of mitosis of cancer cells, and the interphase cells showed also definite changes, such as the conglutination of the structure of nuclear chromatin. It was proved that its therapeutic effect was closely related to the inhibitory action on mitotic process.63 The toxicological studies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys showed that they had no severe side effects, only flattening of T-wave of EKG, nausea, vomiting, and decrease in body weight were observed in the group receiving high dosages. Subcutaneous injection of sodium dimercaptosuccinate, BAL-glucoside, BAL, and cysteine could produce a significant protective action upon mice intoxicated by Sb-71, decreasing the mortality rate of mice. These sulfhydryl drugs could also antagonize the tumor-inhibitory action of Sb-71, but the antitumor effect could recur when the dose level was increased.64 Later, Sb-71 and Sb-57 were recommended for clinical trials and exhibited therapeutic effect on some patients with gastrointestinal carcinoma, fibrosarcoma, breast carcinoma, and other tumors. In 1971, Sb-71 as a new anticancer drug was approved in China for production and used in many hospitals. The mechanistic study revealed that Sb-71 inhibited significantly the incorporation of 65Zn into tumor cells65 and in mice bearing Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, zinc chloride could exert antagonistic action against the therapeutic effect of the drug.66 The experiments of distribution and excretion of Sb-71 indicated that Sb could combine with cancer cells with high affinity and sulfhydryl compounds (sodium dimercaptosuccinate or cysteine) decreased obviously the Sb content in tumor cells.67 Such findings provided us new approaches for searching for novel anticancer agents. Unfortunately, at that period of time due to political movements such work was interrupted, the working team was disorganized as well and no more concern was considered about the clinical use and production of Sb-71. The study of the second generation of this drug was discontinued. In the 1970s to the 1980s, the metal anticancer drugs cisplatin and carboplatin appeared and their remarkable therapeutic efficacy for cancer patients caused great interest for chemical and medical researchers. Cisplatin was recognized as one of the most successful drugs in cancer chemotherapy.68., 69. In the late 1980s to 1990s, Hu et al. at Xiamen University systematically investigated antimony and other metal compounds synthesizing many derivatives and elucidating the structure\u2013activity relationships (SAR).70., 71., 72. He also conducted collaborative work with Russian scientists73 to determine the crystal structures by chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and other methods. The absolute configuration of antimony chelates including Sb-71 and Sb-57 were also studied. Hu pointed out that the work with antimony chelating compounds published in 1960s is farsighted compared with other metal chelating agents in its design, synthesis, and activity assay. It is speculated that antimony preparations should have less toxicities than other metal drugs possessing alkylating activity, because Sb-71 has a different mode of action that could interact with trace metals affecting the tumor growth and metastasis. Tiekink in his review article74 indicated that the exploration of anticancer potential of antimony and bismuth compounds is not as well developed as for other metal-containing species, but they deserve more research effort. Based on the findings about the toxicity, therapeutic effect, and action mechanism, it seems to us that Sb-71 and analogs should have a bright future and further investigations are necessary.",

It was reported82 that in IMM\u2013CAMS a systematic study of taxol isolated from Taxus chinensis was conducted and the national preparation of this drug with similar efficacy as imported taxol was approved in 1990s for clinical use and production. In recent years, some new preparations such as taxol-liposome was prepared by a number of laboratories83 and clinical data showed that it has good therapeutic action with fewer side effects.84 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) implants, a new sustained-release preparation of 5-FU, was invented in the Hefei Technology University, An-Hui Province.85 Clinical study indicated that such sustained-release preparation can be located directly into tumor mass increasing and prolonging the local drug concentration. This drug preparation can enhance therapeutic action and alleviate the side effects remarkably.86 5-FU implant has obtained SFDA approval for production as a new preparation of 5-FU, which is frequently employed in many hospitals, in particular in surgical oncology departments in China.87 As mentioned earlier, ATRA can exert prominent therapeutic action on acute promyelocytic leukemia, and its new analogs, that is, R1=4-(ethoxycarbophenyl)-retinamide and R2=N-4-(carboxylphenyl) retinamide could be used as cancer chemopreventive agents for the treatment of precancerous lesions such as leucoplakia of the mouth and the vulva with a cure rate of 69.2%; some patients with squamous skin cancer were also cured.19\n",

MDR is primarily involved in the anticancer drugs of natural origins.98., 99. It has always been the focused area to develop new strategy to circumvent MDR. Therefore, it is especially noteworthy that salvicine is able to circumvent MDR caused by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression. Salvicine effectively kills tumor cells overexpressing P-gp with a mean resistance factor of 1.42, which is much lower than that of vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide. Salvicine induces similar levels of apoptosis in MDR K562/A02 and parental K562 cells, promising its activity against MDR. Unlike other MDR modulators that inhibit the drug efflux by P-gp, salvicine downregulates mdr-1 and P-gp expression in K562/A02 MDR cells.95., 100., 101., 102., 103.\n",

Salvicine was found to stimulate c-jun gene expression and to inhibit mdr-1 gene expression in MDR K562/A02 cells. Salvicine enhanced levels of the active forms of JNK and c-Jun and raised the DNA-binding activity of AP1. Inhibition of c-jun expression disrupted enhancement of c-Jun and p-c-Jun by salvicine and simultaneously prevented the reduction of mdr-1 mRNA and P-gp protein levels, confirming that c-Jun activation is a prerequisite for reduction of mdr-1 mRNA and P-gp protein levels by salvicine. Most importantly, downregulation of c-jun expression inhibited apoptosis and cytotoxicity induced by salvicine in both MDR and parental K562 cells.101 Another study reveals that activation of JNK, an enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of c-Jun, directly contributes to suppression of mdr-1 gene expression.111 So a clear molecular pathway through which salvicine reduces mdr-1/P-gp expression can be drawn: salvicine stimulates JNK phosphorylation and activated JNK phosphorylates serines 63 and 73 of c-Jun resulting in increased transcription activity. Phosphorylated c-Jun promotes expression of c-jun itself, thus increasing c-Jun levels. Furthermore, the transcription-factor complex containing c-Jun binds to the consensus AP1 target element in the mdr-1 gene promoter and represses transcription leading to reduction of mdr-1 mRNA and P-gp expression and killing MDR tumor cells.",

In addition, salvicine specifically inhibits the adhesion of human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cells to fibronectin and collagen.

Moreover, salvicine induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation.

Salvicine induces telomeric DNA damage and telomere erosion in lung carcinoma A-549 cells, which is independent of cell cycle. Salvicine not only downregulates TRF2 protein level but also impedes TRF2-telomere binding. By overexpressing the full-length trf2 gene and transfecting TRF2 small-interfering RNAs, TRF2 protein is confirmed to protect both telomeric and genomic DNA from the salvicine-elicited events. In addition, it is noteworthy that although both the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and the ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases respond to the salvicine-induced DNA damages, only ATR is essential for the telomere erosion. Thus, the activated ATR augments the salvicine-triggered TRF2 disruption, whereas the TRF2 reduction in turn enhances ATR function.119\n",

However, MFTZ-1 does not affect the degradation of HIF-1\u03b1 protein or the level of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA. By contrast, MFTZ-1 apparently inhibits constitutive and inducible activation of both phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt and p42/p44 MAPK pathways. Moreover, MFTZ-1 abrogates the HIF-1\u03b1-driven increase in VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein secretion. MFTZ-1 also lowers the basal level of VEGF secretion. Therefore, an important feature emerges that MFTZ-1 can reduce constitutive, HIF-1\u03b1-independent VEGF secretion and concurrently antagonize inducible, HIF-1\u03b1-dependent VEGF secretion. Consequently, MFTZ-1 disrupts tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by hypoxia with low-concentration serum or by serum under normoxia and inhibits HUVECs migration under normoxia. MFTZ-1 also prevents microvessel outgrowth from rat aortic ring. Thereby, MFTZ-1 can elicit potent antiangiogenesis under different conditions. By using specific small-interfering RNA targeting Top2\u03b1 or Top2-defective HL-60/MX2 cells, MFTZ-1 was revealed to affect HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation and HUVECs tube formation irrelevant to its Top2 inhibition.

Some of them in clinical trials display excellent therapeutic effectiveness in treating recurrent or refractory cancers.135., 136., 137. Echinoside A (Figure 12.1) is an antifungal marine-derived saponin isolated from sea cucumber.138 Echinoside A shows potent antitumor activities by inhibiting the growth of S-180 sarcoma and H22 hepatoma in standard mouse models and human prostate carcinoma PC-3 xenografts in nude mouse models. Echinoside A is a DNA non-intercalative Top2\u03b1 inhibitor revealing the unique characteristics of inhibiting the non-covalent binding of Top2\u03b1 to DNA by competing with DNA for the DNA-binding domain of the enzyme and for interfering predominantly with the Top2\u03b1-mediated pre-strand-passage cleavage/religation equilibrium over with the post-strand-passage one. These features distinguish Echinoside A from other known Top2\u03b1 inhibitors such as etoposide and doxorubicin. Moreover, Echinoside A induces DNA DSB in a Top 2-dependent manner. Together with its new chemical entity and potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities, the unique action mode of Echinoside A on Top2 makes it a new prototype for further modification and optimization in developing new anticancer drugs.",

Chimmitecan as well as camptothecin was found to induce the repairable DSB in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells. The cellular disposal of DSB was reflected as the progressive dispersal of \u03b3-H2AX foci, reduction of comet tails, dynamic activation of RAD51-mediated homologous recombination (HR) repair, and reversible G2-M arrest. In this process, the differential kinetics of Chk1 and Chk2 activation was characterized by the progressively increased phosphorylation of Chk2 until 72 h, the degradation of Chk1, and the disappearance of phosphorylated Chk1 48 h after drug removal. Using RNA interference, we further showed that Chk2 was essential to G2-M arrest, whereas Chk1 was mainly required for HR repair in CPT-treated HCT-116 cells. Moreover, Chk2, rather than Chk1, predominated over the control of cell survival in this model. The differential roles of Chk1 and Chk2 in regulating HR repair and G2-M-phase arrest were also confirmed in HT-29 colon cancer cells. The data provide critical evidence to further explore checkpoint modulation, especially Chk2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in combination with chimmitecan and other camptothecins.141\n",

PAB displays potent in vitro antiangiogenic activity shown by inhibiting VEGF-stimulated proliferation and migration and fetal bovine serum-stimulated tube formation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, PAB (10 nmol per egg) significantly suppressed in vivo angiogenesis in the CAM assay. On the other hand, PAB abrogated hypoxia-induced VEGF secretion from MDA-MB-468 cells via reducing HIF-1\u03b1 protein. The selective proteasome inhibitor MG-132 completely reversed the reduction of HIF-1\u03b1 protein in the PAB-treated MDA-MB-468 cells. In conclusion, PAB displays the dual antiangiogenic activities of directly inhibiting endothelial cells and abrogating paracrine stimulation of VEGF from tumor cells due to reducing HIF-1\u03b1 protein by promoting its proteasome-mediated degradation in MDA-MB-468 cells, which has potential clinical relevance.149 On the other hand, the antiangiogenic activity of PAB may also be associated with its ability to inhibit MAPK- and AKT-driven antiapototic{aq} signaling and thus to antagonize the antiapoptotic effect of VEGF.150\n",

On the one hand, S9 abrogates the EGF-activated PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling cascade and Akt translocation to cellular membrane in human tumor cells. S9 inhibits both PI3K and mTOR but minimally affects the 30 other tested kinases. Notably, S9 completely impedes hyper-phosphorylation of Akt as a feedback of inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin. On the other hand, S9 arrests cells in M phase other than G1 phase, distinct from compounds targeting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. This unexpected phenomenon results from the fact that S9 inhibits tubulin polymerization via binding to the colchicine-binding site of tubulin. Molecular modeling further supports the conclusion that S9 concurrently targets the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and tubulin by revealing that S9 potentially binds to the kinase domains of PI3K p110alpha subunit and mTOR, and shares similar hydrophobic interactions with colchicine in the complex with tubulin. S9 induces rapid apoptosis in tumor cells, further reflecting the synergism between its blocking the PI3-Akt-mTOR signaling and inhibiting tubulin cytoskeleton. Finally, S9 exerts potent antiproliferative activity in a panel of tumor cells originated from different tissue types including drug-resistant cells and in nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts. Collectively, S9 targets both the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and the microtubule cytoskeleton, which combinatorially contributes to its antitumor activity and provides new clues for anticancer drug design and development.",

A variety of approaches can be used to target EGFR family members, and the most popular two have been explored for extensive cancer chemotherapy against cancers that overexpress EGFR family receptors: blocking ligand binding to the extracellular domain with humanized monoclonal antibodies and using small-molecule inhibitors that interact at the ATP-binding site.170 The most promising small-molecule inhibitors of the EGFR kinase are currently several scaffolds, which include quinazolines,170., 171., 172., 173., 174., 175. pyridopyrimidines,176., 177. benzamides,178., 179. indolinones,180 pyrrolotriazines,181 and others.

Furthermore, although EGFR inhibitors have exhibited curative effects in non-small cell lung cancer patients, some side effects with these agents have been sequentially found, such as cutaneous effects.186 These thereby prompted researchers to discover novel EGFR inhibitors without serious side effects. Recently, a novel framework, which was identified by using a structure-based virtual screening approach187., 188. based on the crystal structure of OSI-774/EGFR-TK189 in conjunction with chemical synthesis and bioassay, was presented by Li and coworkers.190\n",

Conformational flexibility of the compounds from the database was considered during the docking search. Three thousand molecules with the highest score obtained by DOCK search were rescored by using the Consensus Score method (CScore).193 Molecules with a CScore of \u22654 were reevaluated by the pharmacophore194 model of EGFR inhibitors. Finally, 82 compounds were distinguished and purchased for bioassay on the basis of the above virtual screening flow. Among the 82 compounds, the biosensors RU of 26 compounds were concentration dependent. The collected data indicated that these 26 compounds (including compounds 1 and 2) can bind to EGFR in vitro and the binding affinities to EGFR are in the submicro- or micromolar range (K\nD=97.7\u20130.39 mmol/l). Compounds 1 and 2 (Figure 12.2), bearing the higher binding affinities to EGFR as determined by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, were used as lead compounds to design new EGFR inhibitors.

Having kept the common moiety of compounds 1 and 2 of the N-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-quinolin-3-ylmethyl)-thiourea framework, three regions of these two molecules were selected to perform chemical modifications suitable to provide expedient and significant SAR information and improve inhibitory activity: (A) 6- or 7-Me substituent; (B) the N\u0384-phenyl ring; and (C) the N-pyridinylmethyl side chain (Figure 12.6).190\n",

SU5402 with the Z configuration is a selective inhibitor of FGFR and VEGFR. What caught the researcher\u2019s attention in particular was the biological activity of E-3-substituted indolin-2-one derivatives. So it is very interesting to explore whether it would enhance the interaction between indolin-2-one compounds and TK and increase antitumor activity by introducing a \u03b2-pyrrole group into the 3 position of indolin-2-ones. Accordingly, a novel class of 3-pyrrole, 5-substituted indolin-2-one derivatives (5a\u20135t) have been synthesized by Li and coworkers,199 and their inhibitory activities against EGFR, FGFR, VEGFR, and PDGFR were determined.",

However, the cellular assay turned out more encouraging (Table 12.5\n). Four human carcinoma cell lines of A-431, A-549, MDA-MB-468, and ADPKD were chosen for the cell proliferation assay. The results indicate that compounds 5d, 5g, and 5h show promising antiproliferation activities for A-431, A-549, and MDA-MB-468 (percent inhibition rates at 10 \u03bcmol/l >50%; Table 12.5).

The bromination or nitration at the C-5 position of the indolin-2-one core increased the potency\n(5d>5c, 5g>5e). The inconsistency between the enzyme activity and the cellular efficiency could imply that the new type of indolin-2-one compounds might inhibit multiple key proteins involved in the EGFR and VEGFR signaling pathways, not only targeting the TK, thus leading to the significant antiproliferation effect against EGFR-dependent tumor cell lines, which is highly relevant to the overexpression of EGFR or VEGFR kinase.

The ATP-binding pocket of EGFR consists of Thr766, Gln767, Leu768, Met769, Gly772, Thr830, Asp831, Val702, Lys721, Ala719, Glu738, and Met742.200 This binding pocket can be divided into three regions, including two hydrophobic regions and an adenine region. The adenine region mainly comprises Gln767 and Met769. Hydrophobic region I shaped by Ala719\u2013Lys721, Leu764\u2013Thr766, Thr830, and Asp831 is located deep inside the ATP-binding pocket. Hydrophobic region II mainly comprises Leu694 and Gly772. SU5402 formed one hydrogen bond with Thr766, and six hydrophobic interactions with Leu694, Val702, Ala719, Lys721, Leu830, and Asp831 (Figure 12.10A). The intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the N atom of the pyrrole ring and the carboxyl O atom of the indolin-2-one core in SU5402 is responsible for the Z isomeric form (Figure 12.10A). When changing the \u03b1-pyrrole ring to a \u03b2-pyrrole ring, the distance between these two atoms is lengthened, and the introduction of a methyl group in the 5\u0384-position of the pyrrole ring avoids the intramolecular hydrogen bond formation. Figure 12.10B shows the interaction model of compound 5a and EGFR. The indolin-2-one core of compound 5a occupies the adenine pocket of EGFR, and the pyrrole moiety lies in the hydrophobic region. Compound 5a forms three hydrogen bonds with Met769 and Thr830, and eight hydrophobic interactions with Leu694, Phe699, Val702, Ala719, Ile720, Lys721, Arg817, and Leu820. This binding model is similar to that of Tarceva and EGFR.201 The quinazoline and anilino moieties of Tarceva also occupied the adenine pocket and the hydrophobic region, respectively. There are more hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction pairs between 5a and EGFR than with SU5402 and EGFR. It provides a promising new template for further development of antitumor agents.",

Afterward, the nitro group was reduced and condensed with nitromethane followed by thermal cyclization in refluxing aceticanhydride giving the quinolines. The quinolines were then converted, in good yield, to the corresponding chloroquinolines by refluxing in an excess of POCl3. Then, refluxing a solution of a chloroquinolines and a substituted aniline derivative in DMF generated the desired final products in good yields.",

The initial compound 6a with an attached 3\u0384-ethynyl group exhibited potential inhibition activities toward A-431 cell line, with 87.3% inhibition at the concentration of 10 \u03bcM; replacing the ethynyl group with bromo-atom did not improve the inhibition activities. Substitution of the bromo-atom with chloro-atom or fluoro-atom resulted in a sharp loss of inhibitory activities to A-431 cell line. The 3-fluoro-4-chlorobenzenamine substituted nitroquinoline derivative 6d presented potent inhibitory effects against A-431 cell line. But changing the substituted groups at position 6 resulted in a clear decrease in the ability to inhibit EGFR. These findings indicate that both the aniline moiety and the 6,7-dialkoxy substitution play important roles in the inhibition activities. Thus, compound 6d was chosen as the benchmark compound for subsequent optimization studies. The compounds which retained the 6,7-dialkoxy substitution of 6d were first investigated. Among them, compound 6e was a little more active than the initial compounds, with 50% inhibition against MDA-MB-468 at 10 \u03bcM. However, their inhibition activities toward A-431 were decreased. Surprisingly, the compound 6g exhibited high inhibition activity toward both the A-431 and MDA-MB-468, with 89.0% and 88.8% inhibition at 10 \u03bcM, respectively. Subsequently, three derivatives were synthesized, which were designed based on the potent inhibitor 6g. Disappointingly, all these compounds showed decreased inhibitory activities toward both A-431 and MDA-MB-468, and a few of them proved to have completely lost inhibitory activity. To some extent, 6h exhibited a better ability to inhibit A-431 than the other compounds, whereas all of them are poor inhibitors of MDA-MB-468.",

The conformation with the lowest predicted binding free energy of the most occurring binding modes in EGFR active pocket was selected. In the final model with compound 6d (Figure 12.11\n), the N1 atom of the quinoline forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Thr 766, and the 3-nitro group extending deep into the cleft forms a hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone NH of Asp831. As for the 6,7-dialkoxy moiety, the 6-benzyloxy group point to the entrance of the active pocket. Interestingly, the oxygen atom at 7-methoxy group forms a hydrogen bond with the NH of Met769. While for the orientation of 6g, its interactions with the protein are not similar to that observed in the 6d model. The hydrogen bond of the N1 atom to the hydroxyl group of Thr 766 is retained. In this model, the 3-nitro group displaces the 7-methoxy group of 6d that was previously hydrogen bonded to the protein and instead forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Met769. Particularly, the significance of this interaction was reenforced by the performance of the 6-hydroxy group and the 7-methoxy group which form three hydrogen bonds with Asp831 and Thr830, respectively. The binding modes of 6d and 6g with EGFR showed that although different conformations were adopted for the two compounds in the EGFR active pocket, both of them formed favorable hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Thr 766 and the backbone NH of Met769. As reported previously, the interaction with the backbone NH of the Met769 is important for binding to the ATP site both for ATP and inhibitors, which can explain why 6d and 6g are potent with respect to their ability to inhibit the growth of EGFR-overexpressing cell lines. This model will be helpful for further structural elaboration of the novel nitroquinoline series to improve the kinase activity.",

Indeed, it still exhibits two free hydroxyl groups. However, the higher reactivity of 3 position allows the selective esterification by protected amino acids in THF using 1.2 equiv. of N, N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) as condensing agent and a little 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as catalyst. Cleavage of benzyl group was performed with hydrogenolysis catalyzed by 10% Pd/C. Then, the desired final products quercetin-3-O-amino acid-esters were obtained in good yields after purification by chromatography. Substitution at N atom of amino acid moiety is important. In the first attempt to get the compounds bearing deprotected amino group of amino acid moiety, trifluoroacetate acid solution of dichloromethane was used to remove the tertbutyloxycarbonyl group. However, no desired product was detected in the crude product. The target compound may be decomposed in the acidic medium. So an alternative approach performed under mild condition was then investigated. Unfortunately, attempts to debenzylate the compounds bearing benzylated N atom in amino acid moiety under H2 atmosphere at ambient temperature were not successful.

One of the exciting screening results is that compound (4,6-bis(N-morpholino)-[1,3,5]triazin-2-yl)-phenylamine (8a, Table 12.9\n) exhibited moderate inhibition activity toward HT-29 (one of the cell lines of CRC), with 80.5% inhibition at the concentration of 10 \u00b5M. Nowadays, CRC has become one of the major cancers that threaten people\u2019s lives. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 106,680 new cases of colon cancer and 41,930 new cases of rectal cancer in 2006 in the US, and they will cause about 55,170 deaths. Though the death rate from CRC has been going down for the past 15 years, there is a continuing urgent need to develop new potent chemical agents.224 The finding of compound 8a prompted to undertake a study of the in vitro inhibition activities of triazine derivatives substituted by subunits of morpholino and arylamino toward CRC cell lines, HCT-116, and HT-29. Menicagli et al.223 reported 2,4,6-tris(N-morpholino)-1,3,5-triazine and several 2-alkyl-4,6-bis(N-morpholino)-[1,3,5]triazines, with negligible cytotoxic activities against leukemia cell lines, L1210, and HL-60, and glioma cell line C6 but no (4,6-bis(N-morpholino)-[1,3,5]triazin-2-yl)-arylamines and 6-morpholino-N,N\u0384-diaryl-[1,3,5]triazine-2,4-diamines have been considered. Consequently, a series of novel N-morpholino triaminotriazine derivatives were synthesized by Zheng and coworkers.225\n",

For the primary assay, the percent inhibitions of the compounds at the concentration of 10 \u00b5M against HCT-116 and HT-29 were measured. The results are summarized in Table 12.9, Table 12.10, Table 12.11. As shown in Table 12.9, the initial compound 8a exhibited potential inhibition activities toward HT-29 and HCT-116, with 80.5% and 44.9% inhibition at the concentration of 10 \u00b5M, respectively. Introducing substituents to the para position of the phenyl ring of 8a (compounds 8b\u20138d) did not improve the inhibition activities. Substitution of the anilino unit of 8a with benzylamino (8e) or morpholino (8f) resulted in a complete loss of inhibitory activities to both HCT-116 and HT-29. These findings indicate that the anilino group of compound 8a plays an important role in the potent inhibition activities of the CRC cell lines. The mono-N-morpholino substituted triazine derivatives (9a\u20139e) presented more potent inhibitory effects against HT-29 than their corresponding 4,6-bis(N-morpholino)-[1,3,5]triazine derivatives (8a\u20138e). Among them, compounds 9a, 9c, and 9d were a little more active than the initial compound 8a, with 90.5%, 88.4%, and 87.1% inhibition against HT-29 at 10 \u00b5M, respectively. Dianilino derivative (9g) showed more potent activity against HT-29 and a large improved inhibitory activity against HCT-116 in comparison with 8a, with 85% and 81.3% inhibition at 10 \u00b5M, respectively. Thus, compound 9g was chosen as the benchmark compound for subsequent optimization studies. The inhibitory activities of the second round of compounds 9h\u20139x against HCT-116 and HT-29 were tested and the results are summarized in Table 12.10. Compounds 9h\u20139r, which retained the morpholino group and one of the anilino units of 9g, were first investigated. Halogen (F, Cl, and Br) substituted derivatives (9h\u20139j) demonstrated improved activities toward HT-29. However, their inhibition activities toward HCT-116 were decreased. Electron-donating groups substituted on the phenyl ring of 9g produced excellent to good anti-proliferatory potencies against HT-29. For instance, compounds 9l (4-OCH3), 9m (2-OCH3), 9n (3-OCH3), and 9p (4-OCH2CH3) exhibited high inhibition activity toward\nHT-29, with 100%, 89.3%, 87.4%, and 87.5% inhibition at 10 \u00b5M, respectively. The similar potency of compounds 9l\u20139n indicates that a methoxy substituent walking on the phenyl ring had little impact on the inhibition potency to both HCT-116 and HT-29. Synergistic increase in activity was not found for the two methoxysubstituted derivative (9o) toward HT-29 but was found in its activity against HCT-116 with 84.7% inhibition at 10 \u00b5M. The sulfanilamide derivative (9q) and p-aminobenzamide derivative (9r) exhibited the high inhibitory activities against HCT-116, with 96.2% and 85.8% inhibition at 10 \u00b5M, respectively. Among the second round of compounds, four compounds (9l, 9n, 9q, and 9r) exhibited significant inhibitory potency against both HT-29 and HCT-116. Compounds (9s\u20139x), with substituents on both of the two phenyl rings of 9g, showed similar inhibition potency with the benchmark compound 9g. However, they were all less active than the p-methoxy analog (9l). Decreased potency toward HCT-116 was observed throughout this subseries of compounds, and the p-fluoro derivative (9t) proved to be virtually inactive against HCT-116 at 10 \u00b5M. Table 12.11 lists the biological results of derivatives 10a\u201310g, which were designed based on the potent inhibitors of 9g and 9l. All these compounds showed decreased inhibitory activities toward both HCT-116 and HT-29, and a few of them proved to have completely lost inhibitory activity. These results suggest the morpholino subunit directly introduced to the 1,3,5-triazine nuclear is an important determinant of inhibitory activity toward both HCT-116 and HT-29. To determine the exact potency of the compounds that exhibited significant inhibition toward HCT-116 or HT-29 at 10 \u00b5M, 10 compounds (9g\u20139i, 9l, 9n, 9o, 9q\u20139s, and 9v) were further investigated in concentration-response studies, and the results are summarized in Table 12.12\n.",

Most of these compounds showed moderate growth inhibition activities with IC50s ranging from 8.1 to 39 \u00b5M. Compound 9r (IC50=8.1 \u00b5M), which was most prominent in this series of compounds against HT-29, was nearly 4 times more active than the benchmark compound 9g (IC50=31 \u00b5M). Compounds 9g, 9l, 9o, 9q\u20139r, and 9v were tested for their IC50s against HCT-116. Most of them proved to be potent inhibitors with IC50 values below 5 \u00b5M, except compounds 9r and 9v. Among them, compounds 9l (IC50=0.76 \u00b5M) and 9o (IC50=0.92 \u00b5M) were the optimal ones, which were 5 times more active relative to the benchmark compound 9g (IC50=4.7 \u00b5M). Compound 9l, which was the most potent one in vitro against HCT-116, was chosen as the representative one of this class of triaminotriazines to undertake a study of its pharmacokinetic properties and in vivo antitumor activities. The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of 9l were assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats. The orally administered 9l was found to be rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean peak concentration (C\nmax) was 1.29 \u00b5g/ml achieved at 15 min after oral administration. By comparing with intravenous data, the oral bioavailability (F) of 9l was 30.9%. The elimination half-lives (T1/2) of 9l by oral and intravenous administration were 1.16 and 1.09 h, respectively, while the mean resident times (MRT) were 1.88 and 1.06 h, respectively. The distribution volume (V\nd) and clearance (CL) of intravenous 9l were 2.11 and 1.36 l/h/kg, respectively. When evaluated for antitumor efficacy in a sarcoma 180 mice model, compound 9l demonstrated modest tumor-inhibitory activity with 40.7% inhibition at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day.

From the discovery of nitrogen mustard in the 1940s up to now more than 10 classes of new chemical drugs have been discovered that bring great benefits to cancer patients. At the early stage, chemical drugs employed to treat tumors were only expected like chemical knife to replace surgical knife, its usefulness was quite limited. Afterward, a variety of chemical agents not only can cure more than 10 kinds of malignant tumors but also can be used in combination with other modalities to treat different cancers with remarkable efficacy. In recent years, the molecular-targeting drugs were discovered and helped cancer chemotherapy enter a new era with more selective action and less toxicity. Based on molecular oncology, molecular pharmacology, and modern genetic engineering, as well as computer simulating technology by means of docking simulation, crystal structure, and virtual screening methods, some new chemical agents recently designed and synthesized can act on specific genes regulating cancer cell proliferation, division, differentiation and apoptosis, or on metastatic process. It is known that imantinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, and other small-molecule EGFR-tyrosine-kinase inhibitors can treat chronic myelocytic leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), non-small cell lung cancer, and other tumors very effectively; their action mechanisms do not kill the cancer cells as former cytotoxic agents did but have a definite influence on signal transduction or on gene expression of cancer cells. Such chemical substances with more selective activity can regulate or normalize the process of tumor growth and progression. The progress of newly developed molecular target therapy in combination with other effective methods is greatly inspiring researchers to control cancerous disease. It is hoped that in the future, chemical anticancer agents will be used not only for the purpose of curing cancers but also for preventing, repairing, or recovering malignant processes, going from the chemical knife to the chemical regulator or modulator. It will be an important and difficult task for the investigators, and we are confident that it will be successful in the future.",

            "text": "From the above-mentioned data, it can be seen that the progress of cancer chemotherapeutic drug research in China is advancing very quickly. Many anticancer drugs including compounds of natural origin containing TCM products, synthetic agents, inhibitors of topoisomerases, and tumor angiogeneses, as well as other effective preparations were successfully investigated and developed for clinical use and production within a relatively short period of time. A lot of leading compounds or new drug candidates discovered by Chinese scientists are very helpful for future investigations. Undoubtedly, such valuable works have played a favorable role in the cause of cancer prevention and therapy. This chapter aims to help people to find the original work in this area and more achievements and contributions by many organizations or pharmaceutical factories in China may be found in other publications. It is hoped that greater successes and more creative works in the field of discovering new effective drugs will appear in the next decades to control neoplastic diseases.",
