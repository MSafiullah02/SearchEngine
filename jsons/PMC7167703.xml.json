Hence, infection screening of both the donors (live and deceased) as well as the recipients constitutes a key role in the prevention of post\u2010transplant infections. The difference between infection screening for live donor and deceased donor transplantation is related to time constraints. For live donor kidney transplantation, clinicians have ample time to screen and treat infections, to decline unsuitable donors, and find other potential donors if necessary. In deceased donor kidney transplantation, in the interest of time, testing is often limited to serological methods which are readily available and with fast turn\u2010around time.

Chronic HBV infection in the recipient is not a contraindication of kidney transplantation. In HBsAg\u2010positive transplant candidates, the HBeAg and HBV DNA levels should also be evaluated as HBeAg positivity and high HBV DNA levels are associated with increased risk of HBV reactivation after renal transplantation.67 Renal transplantation when both donor and recipient are both HBsAg\u2010positive is also possible, especially in localities with high prevalence of HBV carrier and organ shortage. The use of the HBsAg negative but anti\u2010HBc positive donor is slightly more complex. The risk of transmission to kidney recipients appears to be low though has been reported.68, 69 Such risk can be further reduced by pre\u2010transplant HBV vaccination, use of HBV immunoglobulin (HBIG) and/or in combination of oral nucleostide/tide analogues.70, 71, 72 HBV vaccination is an effective means to prevent HBV transmission and hence should be administered to dialysis patients who are HBsAg\u2010negative and anti\u2010HBs negative.

Oral valganciclovir, oral or IV ganciclovir and oral valacyclovir are all effective prophylaxis for CMV infection.94, 95, 96, 97 While all three agents have shown efficacy in randomized clinical trials, valganciclovir is the preferred prophylaxis for CMV infection. In one randomized controlled trial which compared valganciclovir and ganciclovir, both drugs have demonstrated similar efficacy in preventing CMV disease (17.2 vs 18.4%).\n94 In this context, valganciclovir has the advantage of good bioavailability and lower pill burden. The clinical benefit of valganciclovir was further supported by another prospective randomized trial which included 318 CMV D+R\u2212 kidney transplant recipients. This study compared the different treatment duration of valganciclovir (100 vs 200 days), and concluded that the latter was associated with significantly lower incidence of CMV disease (36.8 vs 16.1%).\n98 Based on these results, the prophylactic approach is preferred in KTR who are D+R\u2212 and a 200\u2010day course of valganciclovir appeared to be the optimal prophylaxis. Compared with the pre\u2010emptive approach, the efficacy of the prophylactic approach was supported by more large randomized trials and was associated with clinical benefits on graft outcomes, mortality and other opportunistic infections.99 However, the prophylactic approach was also associated with higher treatment costs and increased risk of myelosuppression and late\u2010onset CMV disease. The pre\u2010emptive approach refers to regular monitoring of viral replication and initiation of anti\u2010viral treatment when a certain virological threshold is reached. The prerequisite of pre\u2010emptive include good coordination of patients for regular monitoring and fast turn\u2010around time of laboratory tests. Oral valganciclovir and IV ganciclovir are both effective agents for pre\u2010emptive treatment in asymptomatic CMV reactivation.100, 101 Other merits of the pre\u2010emptive approach include lower drug costs and potentially less treatment toxicity with shorter duration of anti\u2010viral therapy.",

Its clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of MRSA exit\u2010site infection, tunnel tract tunnel infection and peritonitis in PD patients.42 Intravenous vancomycin (at a dose of 1 g every 5\u20137 days for total of at least 2 weeks) is a recommended treatment of MRSA exit\u2010site or tunnel tract infection in PD patients.42 Intraperitoneal (IP) vancomycin has been used with success for the treatment of MRSA peritonitis in PD patients. The ISPD guidelines recommended that IP vancomycin be administered for the treatment of PD\u2010related peritonitis due to MRSA.42 Vancomycin is also effective treatment for HD\u2010catheter related infections including exit\u2010site and CRBI.\n131 Other options of MRSA treatment in dialysis patients include teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and quinupristin\u2010dalfopristin. Teicoplanin has the advantage of longer half\u2010life and better tolerability than vancomycin. Daptomycin has been approved for the treatment of complicated MRSA skin infections and bacteremia (with or without endocarditis) in a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day.132 The dosage should remain the same but the frequency should be reduced to every 48 h in stage 4 or 5 CKD patients.133 Linezolid (at a dosage of 600 mg twice daily, IV or PO) has been approved for the treatment of MRSA skin infection as well as community\u2010 or hospital\u2010acquired MRSA pneumonia.134 No dosage modification is required for linezolid in dialysis patients but side effects such as thrombocytopenia and lactic acidosis need to be closely monitored.134 Tigecycline shows good in vitro activity against the majority of MRSA strains and is an approved treatment for MRSA skin and intra\u2010abdominal infections.135, 136 One advantage of tigecycline in CKD and dialysis patients is that it does not require dosage adjustment and has little concern regarding its timing of administration in relation to HD due to its poor dialyzability. There is lack of clinical data regarding the use of IP tigecycline for MRSA peritonitis although previous pharmacokinetics studies have demonstrated the stability of tigecycline in different concentrations of PD fluid.137 Quinupristin\u2010dalfopristin is approved for MRSA skin infections with no dosage adjustment in renal failure subjects but its data in dialysis patients is relatively limited.133 Other novel treatments for MRSA infections include lipoglycopeptides dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin as well as newer generation cephalosporins such as ceftobiprole and ceftaroline.135, 138, 139 The data on these emerging therapies for MRSA, however, is still lacking among renal failure patients and further studies are required to demonstrate their efficacy in such clinical context. Furthermore, some of these agents are still not available in many local centres and hence limiting their clinical utility.",
