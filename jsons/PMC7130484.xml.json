They wrote \u201cwe suggest that the increased incidence of illness observed in the calves fed the higher levels of milk replacer was due to sick calves being force-fed.\u201d They further suggested that feed refusals were a manifestation of anorexia caused by expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. To determine the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in any observed anorexia, we measured concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\n\u03b1) in blood samples on d 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56. Regarding the interaction of cytokines, anorexia, and illness, we wrote (p. 215) \u201cAlthough we recorded temporal changes in TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in blood, these changes were unrelated to dietary treatment\u2026 There were no differences in proportion of calves refusing CMR or in the number of refusals recorded. Additionally, there were no effects of feeding regimen on concentrations of plasma TNF-\u03b1, suggesting that feeding method per se had no effect on anorexia or the calf's ability to use ingested nutrients.\u201d",

Further evaluation of our data (determined after publication) showed that calves voluntarily consumed 99.6, 99.4, and 99.4% of the CMR for calves fed fixed amount of CMR (CON), variable amount of CMR in an accelerated feeding program (VAR), or VAR plus dietary supplement (GAM) treatments, respectively. During the study, 50, 50, and 56% of calves refused \u226540 mL of CMR on at least 1 d during the study for CON, VAR, and GAM treatments, respectively. The authors\u2019 contention that force-feeding was greater for calves fed more CMR is not supported by the data presented here or in our article.",

It is understood that administration of CMR by esophageal feeder entails significant risk, but we determined that the practice was necessary to minimize variation in nutrient intake among calves during the study. Administration of CMR into the rumen may induce ruminal and metabolic acidosis, particularly if large amounts of milk (3 L/d) are repeatedly administered into the rumen (>2 d) by esophageal feeder (Gentile et al., 2004). It should be noted that, in our study, calves were tubed with less CMR than that reported by Gentile et al. (2004). In addition, in most cases (>53% of all instances), calves were administered CMR by esophageal feeder for 1 d only; thereafter, they consumed all CMR offered.",

However, Bartlett et al. (2006) and Cowles et al. (2006) reported no difference in fecal scores between groups of calves fed conventionally or in an accelerated feeding program. Khan et al.

Jasper and Weary (2002) reported no difference in \u201cdiarrhea\u201d [defined as a score of 3 or 4 using the fecal scoring system of Larson et al.
