To cope with uncertainty, people seek information (Allen, 2011; Wilson, 1999) to mitigate tensions and anxiety and become informed about the disaster response (Yang & Hsieh, 2013). Therefore, the relevant literature has focused primarily on investigating the information seeking and sharing behavior (Rahmi, Joho, & Shirai, 2019) of the people affected. Some authors have further distinguished the information behavior of different groups of people. For instance, Pang, Karanasios, and Anwar (2019)) investigate elderly individuals\u2019 information behavior and key activities of preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters.",

Before the pandemic, this group of people had a reasonably traditional offline lifestyle. However, as the lockdown began, they had to adapt to a fully digital lifestyle almost overnight. The Chinese family has been shaped by the one-child policy and migration patterns since the 1980s. The most typical Chinese family structure includes four grandparents, two parents and one child (4-2-1), with the two young parents working and the grandparents taking care of the one child and other household duties. In addition, it is also quite common for elderly individuals to live alone since many of their children move to larger cities for better job opportunities, leaving the elderly behind in villages; their information behavior may differ from that of those living with young and middle-aged people.

As we analyzed the data, we observed how residents adapted their ways of seeking, sharing, and using information. We then conceptualized the phenomenon as information behavior, which describes how people interact with information (Wilson, 2010). The next step was to collect additional data by reading media reports, articles, and watching videos on the Internet. The additional insights allowed us to form a clearer picture of the phenomenon before we chose resource orchestration as the theoretical lens. Using selective coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1990), we drew on a narrative strategy to organize the voluminous primary and secondary data and tables and figures to identify the data structure. We then developed an initial summary framework (to illustrate our findings) by integrating the theoretical lens and the data analyzed.",

However, the features of health crises differ from those of natural disasters, which will lead to different information behaviors. During the health crisis, a city must manage two tasks\u2014dealing with the sudden large number of sick people and keeping city life as normal as possible for everyone else (World Health Organization., 2009).

However, extant studies on information behavior have concentrated on information seeking, but there is a dearth of information use studies (Spink & Cole, 2006). By using information, individuals integrate newly acquired information into their existing knowledge bases. In our study, we learned that information resourcing activities do not guarantee that individuals will be good at using the information without needing to adapt. Residents affected by disasters resource, process, and incorporate disaster-relevant information effectively into their existing knowledge base (Yang & Hsieh, 2013). To adapt, residents learn to use emerging online technologies and process an overwhelming amount of information before this information becomes useful (Spink & Cole, 2006). The three orchestrating mechanisms played critical roles in information use during the lockdown.

As countries and regions vary in terms of culture, family structure, development, and the adoption of online technologies, our findings may not be generalizable and therefore require conditional applications to other countries and regions. For instance, China\u2019s recent development of e-commerce and Fintech has given strong support to case families during the lockdown. This finding is applicable only to countries such as China, which has strongly adopted Fintech, but not in the case of European countries, where paper checks are still prevalent.",

Billions of people, although safe, have been impacted significantly in all aspects of life. The lockdown strategies that have been utilized by governments force residents to stay at home and rely on living life virtually. The way people conduct their daily lives changes overnight, and people must adapt to their new lifestyles. Through the investigation of six Chinese families under lockdown, the study illuminates their information resourcing activities, information behavior adaptation activities, and three supporting mechanisms.",
