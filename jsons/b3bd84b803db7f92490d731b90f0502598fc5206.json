To achieve this objective, EFSA carried out, over recent years, extensive expert consultations and a testing phase to develop a transparent and practicable framework approach to emerging risks identification (ERI). Following the adoption of an operational definition of \"emerging risk\" by EFSA in 2007, ad hoc Working Groups (WG) were created (i.e. the Emerging Risks Internal Collaboration group (ERIC) the Stakeholder Consultative Group on Emerging Risks (StaCG-ER) and the WG on Data Collection for the identification of emerging risks (DACO-WG)) along with a Network of Member States, to start discussing and testing data collection and evaluation approaches in such a framework.",

The WG proposed a revised simplified framework for ERI including three main steps: 1) identification of emerging issues, 2) identification of appropriate data sources and data collection, 3) final evaluation and identification of emerging risks . Emerging issues should be identified at the beginning of the process preferably through expert consultations and access to specialized databases. The WG on Methodology recognised that ERI requires a high level of expertise, as it is typically based on scattered information and major data gaps, which are difficult to interpret without a solid knowledge of the entire food chain. One of the major constraints identified in the efficiency of the procedure piloted by EFSA was the direct accessibility to experts from the SC and Panels. This was deemed to be crucial for an efficient identification of specific issues for focussed monitoring and a meaningful expert evaluation of the issues identified. Thus, it was recommended that the entire ERI process should be coordinated by the SCER Unit with the support of the SC, who will be responsible for the endorsement of the final report on emerging risks.",

Additionally, EFSA could perform more in-depth analysis through an expert workshop process with a more limited number of experts (either from its database, or from its relevant committees). The identified drivers for emerging risks could also serve as the basis for focused data searches by EFSA.",

The strategic time horizon considered should be 5-10 years. The practical outputs will be a list of priority areas for EFSA, with specific drivers and emerging issues/risks and their interactions. This activity is also linked to the Horizon 2020 activity for future research priorities of DG-Research. Some of the inputs given could also impact the work of the Scientific Committee and the Panels, who could trigger self tasking mandates.

The framework used is based on the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) risk analysis and assessment outline and often focuses on animal diseases having emerged in the EU such as Bluetongue (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2011). Another task is assessing the risks of an animal disease emerging in the EU such as Rift Valley Fever (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2013a). When assessing the risk of introduction of bee parasites into the EU the outline from the international plant health protection commission was used (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2013 b). Moreover, tools to assess risks to animal welfare have been developed (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2012a) and in this process the use of animal based indicators are crucial. This is exemplified by the guidance for risk assessment of animal welfare of genetically modified animals (EFSA GMO and AHAW Panels, 2012) -The BIOHAZ Panel produced a series of scientific opinions addressing emerging risks in a wider sense. Issues addressed in these opinions include: carbapenem resistance in food animal ecosystems (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013a); VTEC-seropathotype and scientific criteria regarding pathogenicity assessment (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013b); Monitoring and assessment of the public health risk of \"Salmonella Typhimurium-like\" strains (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2010); the risk posed by Shiga toxinproducing Escherichia coli (STEC) and other pathogenic bacteria in seeds and sprouted seeds (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2011a) and the risk posed by pathogens in food of non-animal origin (EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2013c).",

These new contact structures include wildlife incursion into farming areas as well as population growth of animals and humans. Establishment of pathogens in new areas involves either geographic expansion or geographic jump. Geographic expansion is primarily influenced by changing landscapes caused by climate change or changes in land use.

Within genogroups, they are further categorized into clusters, and within clusters, the individual Norovirus assigned to an outbreak is referred to as a strain (Zheng et al, 2006) .

The incidence of Campylobacter colonization in broiler flocks and incidence of campylobacteriosis in humans showed a concordant seasonality for six European countries between 1997-2007. There was a strong association between the incidence in both broilers and humans in a given month and the mean temperature of the northern hemisphere in the same month, as well as the preceding month. De-seasonalised trends differed between countries, and could not be explained further (Jore et al., 2010) . A detailed time series analysis has been conducted for the incidence of campylobacteriosis in the Grampian region of Scotland (Strachan et al., 2013a ). An epidemic rise from 1990-1999 was mainly observed in adults and was associated with increased availability of poultry meat, increasing international travel and use of proton pump inhibitors. Foodborne exposures dominated the sources of infection in the peak period from 2000 and 2001. A decline and trough were observed from 2001-2006, in particular in children < 5 years in urban regions and attributed to an (unexplained) drop in foodborne cases. The ratio of rural to urban cases increased in this period, because of direct and environmental exposure to ruminant sources. In contrast, the incidence in the elderly increased due to further increasing consumption of PPI. Resurgence was observed from 2007-2011 in all age groups, but particularly in the elderly. Explanatory factors included high prevalence of Campylobacter in chicken, light cooking and still further increases in PPI use. By combining time-series analysis with microbial subtyping, Strachan et el. (2013b) could attribute an increase in disease incidence in young children in rural regions of the Grampian region to strains of ruminant and environmental origin, whereas adults experienced an extended summer peak associated with chicken strains, acquired domestically as well as internationally.",

A regulatory response was initiated in 2000, aiming at interventions at all levels of the food chain. In particular implementation of a Campylobacter surveillance program in poultry and a freezing policy for meat from Campylobacter-positive poultry flocks are considered to have contributed to a decrease in human incidence to pre-epidemic levels (Tustin et al., 2011) . In New Zealand, reported rates of campylobacteriosis and hospitalisations have increased steadily since campylobacteriosis first became notifiable 1980 and peaked at a level of > 380 per 100,000 population in 2006 (approx. 10 times higher than in the EU in the same time period). Poultry consumption, and in particular an increase in the consumption of fresh poultry, was associated with the steady increase and was estimated to contribute more than 50% of all human cases. Authorities in New Zealand established mandatory performance targets for Campylobacter levels on poultry carcasses after processing, and their introduction coincided with a sharp decrease in reported campylobacteriosis as well as hospitalisations (Sears et al., 2011) as well as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which is triggered a.o. by Campylobacter infection (Baker et al., 2012) . In the USA, the incidence of campylobacteriosis in the FoodNet active surveillance system has decreased by approx. 30% from 1996-2005 with most of the decline occurring before 2005. This decline corresponds in time with the introduction of new meat and poultry safety regulations in the USA, although further evidence for a causal relationship is not available (Olson et al., 2008) .",

The larvae feed on the phloem, and dense populations result in tree death. ALB is spread mainly by wood packaging material and originates in China, Korea and Japan. ALB outbreaks and range expansion in China were linked to widespread afforestation and reforestation programs that began in eastern China in the 1960s, using mostly native Populus dakuanensis, a species later found to be highly susceptible to ALB. The largest of the tree-planting programs was the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program, initiated in the arid regions of northern China in 1978 with the goal of establishing forests on more than 35 million ha by 2050. The main goal of the Three-North Program was to increase forest cover and thereby slow desertification and reduce soil erosion. A secondary goal was to increase lumber production. Initially, Populus, Salix, and Ulmus were the principal genera planted, including several exotic Populus species. Single clones were used in some plantings, and mixed species or clones were used in others. As of 2003, over 22 million ha had been planted in the Three-North Program. Widespread tree mortality has been reported in several provinces, especially where ALB-susceptible Populus species were planted. For example, more than 80 million infested trees were cut in Ningxia and 11 million in Inner Mongolia. Heilongjiang, Jilin, Tibet, and Xinjiang. The first reported ALB interception was in 1992 in both Canada and the United States.

However, consumers developed a demand for more tasty tomatoes and required a choice from different types of tomatoes, e.g. vine tomatoes, beefsteak tomatoes and cherry tomatoes, which were supplied by Spain, Morocco and Italy. Northern European producers responded by developing more attractive varieties and different production techniques allowing for marketing of, for example, vine tomatoes under brand names (Huets and Mol, 2013). In the following years a strong demand for vine tomatoes developed, which were supplied not only from European production, but also from import from third countries (e.g. Central and South America). Tomatoes from third countries were imported before, but these were mainly single fruits, in bulk, without green parts (stems and leaves), which were repacked for retail at locations where there was no tomato production. Pests and diseases could be readily detected by inspections of these fruits and introduction of exotic pests did not occur. With the change in consumer demand a change of import occurred and vine tomatoes were introduced from third countries. The green stems and leaves could carry pests and diseases not occurring on or in the fruits, but there was no change in plant health inspection requirements to accommodate to this new product. Moreover, repacking of bulk vine tomatoes for retail required special equipment in use by European tomato producers (they had changed to production systems for producing vine tomatoes) and repacking of exotic vine tomatoes was performed at tomato production places in Europe.",
