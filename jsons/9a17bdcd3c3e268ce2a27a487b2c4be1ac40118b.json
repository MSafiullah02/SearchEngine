CYP3A4 expression is transcriptionally regulated by pregnane X receptor 163 (PXR), which is a ligand-dependent transcription factor (17). NF-\u03baB activation by tumor necrosis 164 factor-\u03b1, in a setting of inflammatory response, has been shown to suppress PXR activation and 165 PXR-mediated gene expression (17, 18) . This results in a reduced CYP450 expression and a 166 decreased drug metabolism, especially CYP450-mediated metabolism. Other genes regulated by 167 PXR, including ABCB1, coding for P-glycoprotein transporter, could also have their expression 168 decreased, contributing to decrease non-renal drug clearance, such as LPV/r. Owing to its low 169 oral bioavailability and extensive metabolism by CYP3A4 isoenzyme, LPV needs to be co-170 administered with low doses of RTV, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, to achieve drug concentrations 171 high enough to inhibit viral replication (19). An added reduced expression of CYP3A4 could 172 dramatically increase LPV plasma concentrations in Covid-19 patients. 173",

            "text": "in HIV patients, about 11% to 14% of the patients experienced grade 2-4 adverse effects, 188 mainly gastro-intestinal or hepatic disorders (22, 23). However, physicians should be aware that 189 drug repurposing is a high risk condition, which can be associated with a different drug safety 190 profile (24). The drug is used in a setting not having been correctly assessed, that could led to an 191 increase of adverse effects and an unfavorable risk-to-benefits ratio (25). Finally, in other words, 192 78% of the patients in our cohort did not experienced adverse drug reaction, which could be 193 surprisingly in this context of very high plasma concentrations. One could hypothesize that the 194 relationship between the upper threshold of 8,000 ng/mL observed in HIV patients and lopinavir 195 safety is uncertain, at least during a short treatment as in Keeping high LPV plasma concentration appears essential considering a possible clinical efficacy 197 of LPV in Covid-19. Antiviral activity assays on cultured cells showed that the 50% effective 198 concentration (EC 50 ) of LPV varied between 8.0 and 11.6 \u00b5M (i.e. between 5,030 and 7,290 199 ng/mL) for MERS-CoV.(5, 26, 27) Considering SARS-CoV, in vitro EC 50 was 17.1 \u00b5M (i.e. 200 10,800 ng/mL), and a concentration as high as 25,000 ng/mL has been reported to inhibit viral 201 replication depending on cell type used (5, 28). For SARS-CoV-2, an intro study showed that 202 LPV but not RTV inhibits viral replication with EC 50 at 26.6 \u03bcM (i.e. 16,800 ng/mL).(6) In our 203 cohort, median trough plasma level was 20,153 (IQR 16,633-26,505) ng/mL barely at these 204 concentrations or just above. The question of whether these plasma concentrations are effective 205 to inhibit in vivo SARS-CoV-2 replication, especially in lungs, is unknown. Furthermore, Covid-206 19 associated vasculopathy or thrombosis could limit pulmonary diffusion. Altogether, this 207 suggest that high plasma concentrations are required to have an antiviral activity. Finally, as most 208",

Patients hospitalized in medicine wards and starting a treatment 234 by LPV/r for Covid-19 pneumonitis between March 18 th and April 1 st have been included in the 235 cohort. Covid-19 pneumonia was considered in the presence of CT scan injuries evocating a 236 SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the absence of other diagnosis.(29) Covid-19 patients were 237 considered as confirmed or suspected if they had a positive or negative PCR, respectively. 238 Patients with ARDS (defined by the need for an invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation) 239 at admission were not included.(30) Data regarding patient demographics, type of Covid-19 240 infection, patient outcome and LPV/r clinical and biological safety were collected. Patients have 241 been identified according to LPV/r dispensing by the hospital pharmacy. The study has been 242 performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and received approval by the our local protocol at the time of the study, patients were eligible to receive a LPV/r 247 treatment as specific anti-Covid-19 therapy if they (i) had a pneumonitis evocating a SARS-CoV-248 2 infection at CT scan and (ii) were requiring oxygen (minimal flow rate 2-3 liters per minute) . 249 LPV/r was started within 24-48 hours after admission. LPV/r therapy consisted in a dose of 250 400/100 mg twice a day in tablets during seven to ten days, according to ward's practices. Drug-251 drug interactions were carefully monitored before initiation and during LPV/r treatment. Patients 252 were drawn in a routine care setting, according to ward's practices. Plasma 257 concentrations of LPV and ritonavir were quantified using high-performance liquid 258 chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Xevo TQD, Waters \u00ae ) by the department of clinical 259 pharmacology (Cochin Hospital, Paris, France). A volume of 100 \u00b5L of plasma sample was 260 mixed with 300 \u00b5L of methanol. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 21,000 g during 10 261 minutes. A volume of 50 \u00b5L of supernatant was diluted by 50 \u00b5L of waters (0.05% formic acid, 262v/v), and 10 \u00b5L was injected into the chromatographic system. The separation was carried out on 263 a BEH C18 analytical column (1.7\u00b5m, 1.7\u00b5m, 50*2.1 mm, Waters, Saint-Quentin, France). The 264 phase mobile composed of 60% of water (0.05 % formic acid, v/v) and 40% of methanol (0.05% 265 formic acid, v/v). The method was validated according to the EMA guideline for bioanalytical 266 method validation (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/ich-m10-bioanalytical-method-validation). 267",
