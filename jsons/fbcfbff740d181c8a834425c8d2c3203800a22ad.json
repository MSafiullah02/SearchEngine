At the community level, the co-circulation of respiratory viruses is common and yet studies generally focus on single aetiologies. We conducted the first comprehensive epidemiological analysis to encompass all major respiratory viruses in a single population. Using extensive multiplex PCR diagnostic data generated by the largest NHS board in Scotland, we analysed 44230 patient episodes of respiratory illness that were simultaneously tested for 11 virus groups between 2005 and 2013, spanning the 2009 influenza A pandemic.

However, age-specific prevalences were greater in the 2013 influenza season than in 2005 for all age groups. It is possible that there is raised awareness in the public and/or clinicians, and consequently greater healthcare seeking and/or sampling behaviour in adults. Alternatively these results could reflect a true increase in non-viral causes of respiratory illness in this age group. We note that a shift in the demography of the Glasgow population has been reported [24] . Our observations might indicate the impact of an ageing population on respiratory-related healthcare services, through an increase in GP/hospital consultations, or a genuine increase in the incidence of adult respiratory infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 686, "end": 690, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "RV was the most prevalent virus overall, corroborating previous UK-based studies that include patients attending both primary and secondary healthcare services [10, 12] .

In additional analyses (Fig. 4) we found the prevalence of severe respiratory illness (patients located in critical care wards) was significantly greater in RV infections than IAV, supporting the proposition that RV is associated with more severe disease than traditionally accepted. Of the other non-influenza viruses, RSV and CoV were relatively highly prevalent. We note that the extent of research into the commonly circulating CoVs is small compared to IAV and RSV, although severe clinical cases are recognized [28] . Our study is the first comparative analysis in the UK to include CoV, providing an important opportunity to quantify its temporal and patient subgroup distributions and co-infection patterns in comparison to the other common virus groups. We confirm that CoV contributes a large fraction of infections during periods of high influenza activity and that CoV is relatively frequently co-detected with other viruses. The contribution of different respiratory viruses to the healthcare burden in Scotland has previously been studied [23] . Further investigation on a seasonal basis is needed to help elucidate the public health relevance of RV and CoV, particularly since CoV has a similar age distribution as the influenza viruses.

That the increasing trend in virus prevalence was most notable in infants (<1 year) also warrants further attention. While it is possible that these findings are influenced by changes in clinical testing decisions, we note that this trend is particularly pertinent in relation to recent European outbreaks of enterovirus D68 in children [33] ; investigation into the contribution of individual viruses will be the focus of future work.

We would expect co-infection frequencies to reflect individual virus prevalences.

Interestingly, co-infections were more likely in general hospital attendees not admitted to critical care wards than GP attendees, supporting the potential role of co-infections in illness severity [35] . There are several limitations to our study to be noted. Detection of viral nucleic acid may not represent active infection for all viruses in all cases [36] , potentially introducing detection biases temporally and across patient groups.
