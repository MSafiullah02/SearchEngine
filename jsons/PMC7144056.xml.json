Subsequent fusion and entry steps depend on the cell type. In fibroblasts, fusion occurs at the plasma membrane and is mediated by an interplay between the fusogenic glycoprotein B (gB) and a trimeric complex comprised of glycoproteins H, L, and O (gH/gL/gO). In contrast, entry into epithelial, endothelial, and certain myeloid lineage cells involves endocytosis followed by endosomal acidification and, in addition to gB and gH/gL/gO, requires a pentameric complex (PC) comprised of gH/gL plus UL128, UL130, and UL131A [2\u20135]. Consequently, antibodies to epitopes in gM/gN, gB, gH/gL, and gO can neutralize CMV entry into a variety of cell types, but because the PC is dispensable for fibroblast entry, antibodies to PC-specific epitopes (i.e., involving UL128, UL130, or UL131A) have no neutralizing activity against fibroblast entry [6, 7]. For reasons that remain unclear, PC-specific antibodies often neutralize epithelial or endothelial cell entry with potencies two to three logs higher than those targeting the other complexes [6, 7]. The relative importance of PC-specific antibodies vs. more broadly neutralizing but generally less potent antibodies in preventing CMV-associated disease in immunosuppressed or congenitally infected individuals remains unclear.",

            "text": "Consequently, most current studies focusing on humoral immunity to CMV quantify neutralizing potencies using both fibroblast- and epithelial cell-based in vitro assays. Endothelial cell-based assays have become increasingly less common, presumably due to the assumption that CMV enters epithelial and endothelial cells by similar if not identical mechanisms [3]. Consequently, antibodies are expected to neutralize epithelial and endothelial cell entry with similar potencies. However, in patients undergoing CMV reactivation following solid organ transplantation, differences as high as 16-fold were observed between neutralizing titers measured with epithelial cells vs. endothelial cells, while differences of two-fold or less were observed in pregnant women undergoing primary CMV infections [8]. These results suggest that although the PC is required for efficient CMV entry into both cell types, mechanistic differences may exist between epithelial and endothelial cell entry. Such differences could manifest as discordant sensitivities to antibodies targeting specific epitopes (i.e., antibodies that neutralize entry into one cell type but not the other, or exhibit significant variations in potency). Consequently, significant titer differences in certain antisera could arise if such epitopes dominate the humoral response.",

The GFP-tagged CMV UxcAp66 [10] was used due to its ability to enter human epithelial and endothelial cells with similar efficiencies (Qi et al., unpublished observations). Human sera were obtained from healthy adults and screened for CMV seropositivity by gB-ELISA as previously described [11]. CMV-positive sera were serially diluted in cell culture medium, mixed with an equal volume of inoculum containing virus and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, then replicate aliquots were transferred in triplicate to wells of black-walled, clear-bottom 96-well plates containing confluent ARPE-19 epithelial cells (ATCC CRL-2302) or human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC, a gift from Dong Yu). After incubation for 3\u20137 days, representative images were taken using a Nikon Diaphoto 300 UV microscope and relative fluorescent units of GFP were measured for each well using a Biotek Synergy HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were determined using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) as the inflection points of four-parameter curves fitted to plots of mean relative fluorescent units (from triplicate wells) vs. Log (antibody concentration) as described previously [12].",

The finding that the PC is required for epithelial/endothelial cell entry but not for fibroblast entry prompted studies to determine if neutralizing antibody potencies are significantly influenced by the cell type. Sera from naturally infected human subjects were found to be substantially more potent in neutralizing entry into endothelial and epithelial cells than into fibroblasts [8, 16\u201318], and through adsorption studies, the additional epithelial-specific component of neutralizing activity was attributed to antibodies specific to the PC [19, 20]. Importantly, the observation that candidate vaccines with suboptimal efficacy were poorly immunogenic with respect to inducing epithelial-specific neutralizing responses suggested that improved efficacy could potentially be achieved by increasing epithelial cell-specific neutralizing responses [16].",

However, just as exclusive reliance on fibroblasts concealed and delayed the discovery of epithelial-specific neutralizing antibodies, and inadequately characterized the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates, an analogous risk may exist in using only epithelial cells to measure neutralizing activities. Unappreciated and potentially subtle differences between epithelial and endothelial cell entry may thus result in antibodies to certain epitopes exhibiting greater potency against entry into one cell type vs. the other. While such differences may not be readily observable in the context of polyclonal responses to a broad range of neutralizing epitopes, more focused responses, such as those induced by subunit vaccines, could potentially induce neutralizing responses that are robust when measured using epithelial cells but modest when measured using endothelial cells, or vice versa.",

While these results were noted, their implications regarding potential mechanistic differences in epithelial vs. endothelial cell entry were not discussed. To confirm and extend these reported observations, we examined the epithelial and endothelial neutralizing potencies of sera from healthy, naturally infected human subjects using highly comparable, objective, and quantitative methods. While the neutralization curves of six of the eight human sera were nearly superimposable, one sera exhibited ~two-fold higher epithelial vs. endothelial IC50, while a second serum exhibited a statistically significant six-fold difference.",

While antibodies in the panel may recognize up to six unique PC-specific epitopes, only one gB antibody was included, and although seven additional mAbs target epitopes in gH or gH/gL, binding interference assays suggest that these seven antibodies may target only two unique epitopes [13].
