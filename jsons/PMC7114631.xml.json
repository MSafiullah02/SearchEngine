The oldest classic of TCM is Huangdi Neijing (Inner Canon of Huangdi or the Yellow Emperor\u2019s Medicine Classic), which was written 2000\u20133000 years ago [1]. The basic theory of TCM includes five-zang organs and six-fu organs, qi (vital energy), blood, and meridians. TCM is based on the holistic principles and emphasizes harmony with the universe. It categorizes the causes of diseases into two groups: external causes and internal causes. It differentiates syndromes according to the eight principles (yin, yang, exterior, interior, cold, heat, deficiency (xu) and excess (shi)).",

It also has experienced further development and modernization over time [2], [3]. In the 1950s, Chairman Mao Zedong authorized an attempt to create an academic/formal/systematized medicine. One of the major changes in the medicine is it eliminated everything considered to be superstitious. One example of such a concept is \u201cHun-Po\u201d1\nof which there was no mention in the texts of the 1960s and 1970s. In terms of acupuncture practice a certain standardization of the acupoints and needling techniques took place which was exported with the early teachers who came to the west and founded acupuncture schools on the TCM academic model. Herbal medicine and Zang Fu syndrome differentiation were also standardized. Thus, strictly speaking, the term TCM in the west should be referred as Chinese medicine rather than TCM.",

For example, TCM is more often used for chronic conditions than acute conditions. It is more complicated to evaluate its clinical effects. For example, some Chinese herbal medicine is prescribed to treat diseases from the root cause rather than to decrease the symptoms immediately. So, it might take months or years for patients to recover, which is problematic for most of the clinical designs in order to evaluate long-term outcomes.",

Although both Chinese and Western experts realize that RCT may not be appropriate to evaluate TCM since it requires individualized treatment based on the diagnosis of each patient, there is not any innovative evaluation design available [20]. To fill the gap between TCM and evidence based medicine (EBM), efforts have been put on conducting systematic reviews and clinical studies in China [21]. For example, as part of the international Cochrane Collaboration, the Chinese EBM/Cochrane Center was established in China in 1999. It provides both clinical control trial studies and meta-analysis reviews on the available studies of TCM.",

It is critical to develop well-designed survey studies in order to further investigate the determinants of the TCM utilizations. For example, what is the impact of health insurance and other socio-economic factors? Do historical factors, such as the adverse campaign on TCM during the Cultural Revolution result in some cohort differences in the TCM utilization? For example, what is the funding impact from pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies on western medicine usage and TCM medicine? Do the pharmaceutical companies and herbal medicine manufacturers have different profitability, marketing strategies, social and political impact on health care policies and regulations, which directly or indirectly influence western medicine and TCM practices? Better understanding of the pattern of TCM utilization can help government reform the health delivery and financing infrastructure. It can also guide government to provide specific policies, such as promoting TCM in specific geographic locations, for subgroups who may receive more benefit from TCM treatment, and to efficiently allocate TCM resources.",
