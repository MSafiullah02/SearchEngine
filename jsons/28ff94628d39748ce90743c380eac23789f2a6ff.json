More robust evidence is required on different types of medical-grade facial protection. As research on COVID-19 advances, investigators should continue to examine the impact on alternatives of medical-grade facial protection. 4 For healthcare workers providing direct inpatient care for patients with COVID-19, a medical mask, gown, gloves and eye protection in the form of goggles or a face shield should be used. 4 If aerosol-generating procedures are being performed, healthcare workers should also wear an apron and use an N95 respirator in the place of a surgical mask. 4 In outpatient settings, providers examining patients with respiratory symptoms should wear a medical mask, gown, gloves and eye protection. 4 A different set of PPE requirements for healthcare workers not involved in direct care of patients with COVID-19 and for the general public have been outlined by the WHO and vary based on circumstance. If medical-grade PPE is not available or in short supply, the WHO recommends appropriate and minimised use of PPE according to clinical setting and personnel. 4 The purpose of this scoping review is to compile existing evidence on the use and efficacy of medical-grade and alternative forms of facial protection for healthcare workers amidst the growing global shortage. For the purposes of this review, 'facial protection' refers to surgical masks, N95 respirators and face shields (table 1). In studies that did not specify the category of protection, the term 'PPE' is used.",

Next, the selected records, including both grey literature and peer-reviewed articles, were reviewed by at least two authors according to the following criteria: (1) the record defined or characterised the state of current PPE shortages; defined or characterised the mode of transmission or prevention of COVID-19; examined evidence for the extended use, reuse and decontamination methods for medical grade masks; or addressed the efficacy and safety of alternative and improvised masks, and (2) the record was available in English. This initial search was further refined to exclude articles that were not applicable to healthcare settings, concerned product design at the industrial level, or focused on PPE other than N95 respirators, surgical masks or face shields (figure 1). Published systematic reviews and meta-analyses were excluded, as meta-analysis was beyond the scope of this scoping review. We resolved disagreements on record selection and data extraction by discussion with other authors as needed.

Untrained individuals without proper fit testing can often achieve Federal Drug Administration (FDA) minimum fit factor standards, but fewer than 25% achieve the score of 100 expected BMJ Global Health in workplace settings. 16 Addition of a peripheral Vaseline barrier has been shown to prevent peripheral air leakage and reduce exposure to airborne viral particles, making this a potential compensatory strategy when fit testing is not feasible. 17 Further evidence regarding mask fit in the inpatient setting is presented in the next section.",

A small randomised controlled trial (RCT) found that incidence of upper respiratory infection symptoms was similar between groups of inpatient healthcare workers who wore surgical masks and those who did not wear masks. 21 However, studies comparing efficacy of different types of medical-grade masks in the inpatient setting have conflicting results. One non-inferiority RCT of nurses working in medical and paediatric inpatient units found that use of a surgical mask compared with a fit-tested N95 respirator resulted in non-inferior rates of laboratoryconfirmed influenza. 22 Several other RCTs found that rates of respiratory infection illness were lower in healthcare workers who used fit-tested N95 respirators compared with those who used surgical masks. [23] [24] [25] Similarly, N95 respirators have been shown to provide superior protection against respiratory bacterial infections or bacterial-viral coinfections when compared with surgical masks. 26 The literature regarding mask fit in the inpatient setting is limited to one study. An RCT comparing fit-tested and non-fit-tested N95 respirators found no significant difference in ability to protect against respiratory illness, despite in vitro evidence of significant reduction in filtration efficacy with peripheral air leakage. 24 27 Furthermore, non-fit-tested N95 respirators were significantly more protective than surgical masks. 24 In the context of COVID-19, a recent case report identified 41 healthcare workers exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through aerosol-generating procedures. Among these providers, 85% were wearing surgical masks at the time of exposure, and the remaining 15% were wearing N95 respirators. 28 None of the exposed providers contracted COVID-19. 28 Our scoping review did not identify any other studies comparing the efficacy of medical-grade masks during aerosol-generating procedures.",

Although they may be effective for viral inactivation, methods using microwave irradiation, microwave-generated steam and moist heat incubation can compromise the physical integrity of respirator components. [38] [39] [40] [41] Treatment with bleach results in residual odour, release of chlorine gas on exposure to moisture and, in one model, partial nose pad dissolution without an associated increase in aerosol penetration. 38 39 Decontamination with hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, autoclave, 160\u00b0C dry heat, 70% isopropyl alcohol and soaking in soap and water may cause significant loss of filtration efficiency. 39 42 Although ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has previously been shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-1 and preserve N95 performance after three cycles of exposure (totalling 45 min at 1.8 mW/cm 2 ), one study found that increasing UVGI doses could compromise the strength of N95 respirator material and straps. 39 43-45 A recent analysis of N95 decontamination methods using Escherichia coli as a surrogate model for SARS-CoV-2 found that application of chlorine and alcohol-based methods led to a significant decrease in the efficiency of N95 filtration media due to loss of microfibre static charge, while BMJ Global Health use of ultraviolet light, boiling water vapour and dry oven heating maintained filtration efficiency and successfully decontaminated N95 respirators. 46 Overall, strategies involving the use of UVGI, ethylene oxide, dry oven heating and hydrogen peroxide vapour may be most promising for preservation of mask function and integrity. 38-40 42 Decontamination with UVGI, moist heat incubation and microwave-generated steam does not appear to significantly affect N95 respirator fit or comfort. 47 Until application of these methods has been adequately investigated in the hospital setting, their safety and effectiveness in the particular context of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is unknown. Although decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators could help conserve facial protection during emergency shortages or in lowresource settings, additional research is required to understand the impact of these methods on mask fit and function, as well as their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2.",

However, the authors were unable to determine the relative efficacy of cloth masks compared with no mask use since the study lacked a no-mask control arm. 49 Outside of the inpatient hospital setting, the evidence on the effectiveness of improvised masks is limited to laboratory or controlled settings. 50 51 One in vitro study analysed the protection that an N95 equivalent, a surgical mask and an improvised tea cloth mask conferred on the wearer and individuals surrounding a simulated infectious patient. 50 The N95 equivalent respirator provided the best protection, followed by the surgical mask, then the home-made tea cloth mask. Though this study did not have an unmasked control group, cloth masks were found to have a protection factor greater than one, and the authors concluded that cloth masks were superior to no masks for decreasing exposure and infection risk on a population level. 50 In another study comparing surgical masks and home-made masks crafted from cotton T-shirts, surgical masks were found to be three times as effective for reducing micro-organisms expelled by the wearer, with a fit factor double that of the homemade masks. 51 However, both masks significantly reduced droplet dispersal.",

            "text": "Cloth masks are a low-cost alternative but appear to provide inferior protection against respiratory illnesses for several possible reasons. Because cloth masks can retain moisture, be reused and require cleaning, they may increase the infection risk for hospital care workers. 49 The number of layers may also contribute to the mask's ability to prevent viral transmission. Cloth masks usually have one to two layers of protection compared with the fourlayered N95 respirator. 52 Similar to medical-grade masks, fit is an important factor in the effectiveness of improvised masks. 27 52-54 Peripheral air leakage can expose the wearer to airborne viral particles. Studies have shown that air leakage from an improvised mask can be reduced when the discussed materials are used in combination with additional measures to improve facial fit (e.g., nylon hosiery). 35 Although household fabrics are not intended for respiratory protection, these materials may still have limited capacity for small-particle filtration. 48 An in vitro study found that a sweatshirt made of 70% cotton/30% polyester had the greatest resistance to penetration by various uniform and non-uniform nanosized particles compared with other household materials. Researchers also found that the particle filtration performance of certain cotton and polyester household fabrics may compare to some surgical masks. 48 55 However, this study did not evaluate the effectiveness of these fabrics for protecting against droplets or liquids and overall concluded that filtration efficiency varied greatly by fabric. 48 Other investigators found that tea towels and a cottonblend fabric captured 0.02 \u03bcm particles with respective effectiveness of 73% and 70%, while the scarves tested were shown to be less than 50% effective. 51 In the same study, vacuum cleaner bags were shown to be 89% effective in capturing 0.02 \u03bcm-sized particles, but were not recommended due to their poor breathability. 51 Based on filtration efficacy and breathability, the authors concluded that pillowcases and 100% cotton T-shirts were the best readily available household options for improvised masks, with the T-shirt preferred due to its potential for superior fit. 51 This inconclusive evidence for the best choice of material may be partially explained by the heterogeneity of factors in fabric construction, including fibre density and the influence of tensile strength, air permeability and flexural rigidity of the fabric. 35 Improvised mask design is another variable of unknown significance. For example, in one study, a cloth mask with an exhaust valve and a conical tetrahedral shape outperformed the filtration ability of other cloth masks with most particle sizes. Unfortunately, the material composition of each cloth mask was unknown. 56 The use of surgical sterilisation wrap has been proposed as medical and community groups organise to make improvised masks in light of facial protection shortages. 57 This material is a component of surgical instrument packaging used to maintain sterility. Some surgical wraps are made using a spunbond/meltblown/spunbond nonwoven polypropylene fabric, which may be similar to the non-woven, meltblown fabric used in medical-grade masks. [58] [59] [60] Sterilisation wrap is also made to meet FDA standards of bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE), a test performed on materials designed to protect against aerosols, and some report a BFE of 98.9%-99.9%.

However, there are little to no data available regarding effectiveness of a two-layer cloth mask with a middle filter and only one study that may guide the choice of said filter. Even with this scarcity of evidence, some may choose to add a filter to improve the effectiveness of an improvised cloth mask. When considering incorporation of a filter material, it is important to consider durability, breathability and the need for replacement. 51 Recently, some have proposed using heating, ventilation and airconditioner filter inserts with particle size filtration properties similar to those of N95 respirators. 64 Electrostatic cotton and non-woven, meltblown fabric are both known components of medical-grade masks and may also serve as useful filters. However, availability, access and costs of these materials are likely to be prohibitive. 65 Of note, a news report from South Korea mentions an innovative washable electrostatic cotton which can serve as a more durable, insertable filter. 66 Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of these materials for preventing respiratory infection and penetration of viral particles. This information may be particularly useful in low-resource settings if effective materials are inexpensive and readily accessible.",
