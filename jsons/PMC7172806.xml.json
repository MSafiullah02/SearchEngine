            "text": "For the first time in late December 2019, cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, China, and later in January 2020, a new type of coronavirus was identified as the cause of those pneumonia cases [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) chose the official name of COVID- 19 (stand for coronavirus disease 2019), for the disease, as well as the term SARS-COV-2(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) for the virus[2]. A similar to SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses trend has been seen in the epidemiology of this emerging disease[3]. In March 11, 2020, the WHO announced COVID-19 as a pandemic[4]. The disease is highly contagious and each infected person could infect at least 3 other people on average[5]. As of, April 15, 2020, 76389 patients with COVID- 19 have been identified in Iran, of which 4777 deaths have been occurred by the virus. According to statistics, Iran ranks sixth after the United States, Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom in the number of deaths due to COVID- 19 [6]. The first deaths from COVID-19 reported officially on Feb 19, 2020[7]. Identifying the epidemiological characteristics of this disease will help to make appropriate decisions and thus control the epidemic. Certain epidemiological features of COVID-19 have been previously reported [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. However, these studies were based on relatively small sample sizes, and mostly from China. The aim of this study was characterization of the epidemiological features of COVID-19 in Iran as a country with a population of more than 83 million people [12] in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf region. Here, we report the results of an epidemiological analysis of all cases hospitalized in Baqiyatallah Hospital, affiliated to Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences (BMSU), in Tehran, Iran.",

Sex ratio (male to female) and the case fatality rate (CFR) were calculated. To investigate the effect of age, gender, and comorbidities on mortality, a multiple logistic regression model was used. Adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was calculated. The \u03b1: 0.05 was considered as a significance level.

The CFR was 8.54% and 7.13% for men and women, respectively. A total of 323(10.89%) of patients had chronic underlying diseases. As shown in Fig. 2\n, Diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases and cancer were the most common comorbidities with 3.81, 2.02, 1.99, 1.25, 0.60 and 0.57 %, respectively.

            "text": "The present epidemiological study on 2964 COVID-19 hospitalized cases between 19 February 2020 to 15 April 2020, provides information about the disease and the outbreak in Iran. As shown in Fig. 1, the increasing trend of hospitalized cases over a short period of time (19 February to March 11) is clear. This finding could confirm the rapid spread of the disease in the population. The peak of hospitalization occurred on March 11, and since March 17, the number of hospitalized cases has decreased slightly. The data appear to indicate a propagated source pattern of spread. Estimates suggest that around 14% of people infected with COVID-19 have severe disease, and 6% are critically ill [13], hence, about 20% of all cases of the disease are usually need to be hospitalized. Since Baqiyatallah Hospital is a referral center in Tehran, so, it can be concluded that there is probably a similar trend in the general population. Among the 239 deaths, a majority (160 = 66.94%) has been \u226560 years of age and 38(15.89%) had comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases and etc. According to the results of our study, overall CFR was calculated to be 1.85% based on the total number of patients (both outpatient and inpatient). Other studies have been reported CFR ranged from 2.5% to 3%,[14,15]. CFR was also calculated to be 8.06% among hospitalized patients, it is not surprising that the CFR among hospitalized patients was high as patients with a better general condition who were not hospitalized and therefore not included in the denominator. A recently published systematic review and meta-analysis reports a CFR of over 13% in 7 studies describing 632 hospitalized patients[16]. Also, two studies from China, reported a CFR of 15% [8]and 11% [9], respectively. Besides, in a study the CFR has been reported to be as high as 49% among critical hospitalized cases[17]. The results of logistic regression showed the significant effects of age, male gender and underlying diseases on risk of death in patients with COVID-19. In line with other studies[18,19] the regression analysis in our study revealed that older age is associated with higher risk of mortality. Some studies showed that older age is associated with declined immune system ability[20]. Previously, older age has been reported as an associated factor for mortality in SARS [21] and MERS[22]. The present study showed that male gender significantly increases mortality (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.08-1.96). We also observed a greater number of males than females in the 2964 cases of COVID-19 infection. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have also been found to infect more men than women[23,24]. This finding is consistent to other studies [9,25]. The less susceptibility to infection among women could be attributed to the X chromosome and sex hormones, which have been reported to play role in innate and adaptive immunity[26]. Furthermore, according to our results, 10.89% of patients had chronic underlying diseases, mainly diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases; this is similar to MERS-CoV [24]. In line with other studies[[27], [28], [29]], our result also showed that, having comorbidities had a statistically significant effect on Mortality (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.04-2.24). A study suggested that compared to patients with no comorbidities, the risk of death in patients with influenza is more than in those who had cardiovascular disease and hypertension[30]. As far as our knowledge shows, the present study is the first descriptive study of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, with a large sample size. Although the sample size in the present study is a major advantage, unfortunately, more detailed patient information, particularly regarding clinical outcomes and early symptoms was unavailable at the time of analysis. Importantly, this may limit the conclusions from this data. However, the data in this study permit an early assessment of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in Tehran, Iran. Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings would help to get a full picture of the clinical presentation, natural history, risk factors and the spectrum of clinical severity of the disease. In addition, further efforts should be made to compensate for the above mentioned limitation in future studies. Rapid, reliable and feasible diagnostic tests are important, as well as differential diagnoses based on clinical descriptions by physicians. Careful national surveillance is essential to monitor the disease and its epidemiological characteristics including infectivity, host adaption, viral evolution, transmissibility, and pathogenicity. Efforts and initiatives at the national, regional and global levels need to be made to cut off the disease transmission chain.",
