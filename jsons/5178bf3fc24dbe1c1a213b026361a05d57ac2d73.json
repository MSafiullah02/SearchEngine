            "text": "Background: Reliable information is an essential component for responding to the COVID-19 epidemic, especially regarding the availability of critical care beds (CCBs). We propose three contributions: a) ICUBAM (ICU Bed Availability Monitor), a tool which both collects and visualizes information on CCB availability entered directly by intensivists. b) An analysis of CCB availability and ICU admissions and outcomes using collected by ICUBAM during a 6-week period in the hard-hit Grand Est r\u00e9gion of France, and c) Explanatory and predictive models adapted to CCB availability prediction, and fitted to availability information collected by ICUBAM . Methods: We interact directly with intensivists twice a day, by sending a SMS with a web link to the ICUBAM form where they enter 8 numbers: number of free and occupied CCBs (ventilator-equipped) for both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19-negative patients, the number of COVID-19 related ICU deaths and discharges, the number of ICU refusals, and the number of patients transferred to another r\u00e9gion due to bed shortages. The collected data are described using univariate and multivariate methods such as correspondence analysis and then modeled at different scales: a medium and long term prediction using SEIR models, and a short term statistical model to predict the number of CCBs. Results: ICUBAM was brought online March 25, and is currently being used in the Grand Est r\u00e9gion by 109 intensivists representing 40 ICUs (95% of ICUs). ICUBAM allows for the calculation of CCB availability, admission and discharge statistics. Our analysis of data describes the evolution and extent of the COVID-19 health crisis in the Grand Est region: on April 6th, at maximum bed capacity, 1056 ventilator-equipped CCBs were present, representing 211% of the nominal regional capacity of 501 beds. From March 19th to March 31st, average daily COVID-19 ICU inflow was 68 patients/day, and 314 critical care patients were transferred out of the Grand Est region. With French lockdown starting on March 17th, a decrease of the daily inflow was found starting on April 1st: 23 patients/day during the first fortnight of April, and 7 patients/day during the last fortnight. However, treatment time for COVID-19 occupied CCBs is long: 15 days after the peak on March 31st, only 20% of ICU beds have been freed (50% after 1 month). Region-wide COVID-19 related in-ICU mortality is evaluated at 31%. Models trained from ICUBAM data are able to describe and predict the evolution of bed usage for the Grand Est region. Conclusion: We observe strong uptake of the ICUBAM tool, amongst both physicians and local healthcare stakeholders (health agencies, first responders etc.). We are able to leverage data collected with ICUBAM to better understand the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Grand Est region. We also present how data ingested by ICUBAM can be used to anticipate CCB shortages and predict future admissions. Most importantly, we demonstrate the importance of having a cross-functional team involving physicians, statisticians and computer scientists working both with first-line medical responders and local health agencies. This allowed us to quickly implement effective tools to assist in critical decision-making processes.",

Supported by Inria (French national research institute for the digital sciences), ICUBAM is an open-source web-based application, available at GitHub and can be easily deployed elsewhere.

We provide a brief description of the tool and the data collected to highlight its ease-of-use and pertinence during the crisis. In section III, we present descriptive statistics and visualizations which testify to the importance of having real-time data during such a crisis. Finally, in section IV, we propose a SEIR model to describe the course of the pandemic using ICUBAM data, and show that it has better descriptive and predictive performances for patient inflow (number of patients admitted to ICU) and outflow (number of deceased and discharged ICU patients) than models calibrated on public data only or even on both sources of data. We complement this medium-horizon modeling by a short-horizon analysis using simpler statistical models to predict daily bed requirements.",

The number of patients refused due to CCB shortages is not taken into account as they are often rerouted to an in-r\u00e9gion ICU. Since April 1st, a decrease in the daily number of patients entering the ICU of the Grand Est is visible for all d\u00e9partements. This is most likely due to the lockdown measures put in place on March 17th, which suggests a two-week delay (mean duration between time from contamination to hospital admission) in system response to confinement measures [Zhu et al., 2020] . Patient outcomes are also important for understanding the situation. Cumulative deaths, discharges (living) and transfers from ICU are presented in Figure 5 . In this Figure, we can see that both deaths and discharge statistics follow the same slope until March 27th, at which point the discharge rate increases while the death rate decreases. This might be due to an evolution in admission criteria of COVID-19 patients, as well as time-to-discharge being significantly longer than time-to-death. Details by d\u00e9partement are given in Figure 14 in Appendix D.",

We can see that death and discharge rates are initially similar, but eventually discharges rate increases while death rate decreases. Figure 6 visualizes patient outcomes during the study period for each d\u00e9partement. In-ICU mortality 2 months after the onset of the pandemic's start is 31.4%. This in-ICU mortality significantly lower than mortality reported by [Richardson et al., 2020] . Although the outcome of transferred patients is currently unknown, patients selected for transfer were generally more stable. One possible reason for this discrepancy is that ICU stay correlates strongly with outcome, and so patients likely to decease do so early on, whereas successful discharges happen much later. The longer time window of our study may therefore better capture the ultimate mortality rate of ICU stays. Figure 6 : Summary of patient outcomes during the studied period for each d\u00e9partement: total number of COVID-19-related deceased, discharged, or transferred patients as well as number of patients still in intensive at the end of the period. The sum of these four quantities represents the cumulative flow, over the period under consideration, of patients requiring admission to ICUs in each d\u00e9partement. Figure 7 shows the evolving demand and supply of CCBs in the Grand Est region. This figure also demonstrates the impressive increase in CCB capacity, going from a nominal capacity of 501 beds to 1056 beds in 12 days i.e. 211% of nominal capacity. Nevertheless, this sudden increase in capacity was not enough to satisfy the need for CCBs, and almost 600 patients had to be transferred out of r\u00e9gion to avoid surpassing the available CCB capacitys. After the pandemic's apex, the decrease in the number of occupied CCBs is observable, but evolves slowly. COVID-19 CCB bed use went from 250 to 500 in 6 days (from 03/18 to 03/24), however the decrease from 750 to 500 has taken a total of 24 days (from 03/30 to 04/23), 4 times slower than the rate of admissions. This slow rate of discharges means that the system is still over-saturated, and a second wave of admissions would be difficult to absorb.",

We have placed a dot to indicates the first date on which the nominal capacity is exceeded. The Bas-Rhin stands out, with a number of occupied beds which increased sharply on March 27. The number of people transferred was also significant at the time and started to decrease from March 30 (not represented here). As the epidemic evolved in the Grand Est region, different d\u00e9partements evolved differently in terms of CCB availability and demand. Temporal evolutions of each d\u00e9partements' CCB occupation can be compared using a correspondence analysis [Husson et al., 2017 , L\u00ea et al., 2008 . Figure 9 can be interpreted as follows: two d\u00e9partements are close if they have the same evolution over time in terms of proportion of COVID+ occupied beds, and two dates are close if the distribution of occupied beds in the different d\u00e9partements is approximately the same. For the interpretation of the positions of a date and a d\u00e9partement, we can say that a d\u00e9partement goes towards the dates it is the most associated with, and away from dates it is the least associated with: a d\u00e9partement is associated to a date if the number of occupied beds is high for this d\u00e9partement at this date comparing to what happen in this d\u00e9partement in the other dates, and also comparing to what happen at this date in the other d\u00e9partements. What is noticeable is that we can observe three clusters 3 of temporal behavior: between the 18 and 26 March (dates in red) the bed use increases significantly, between March 27th and April 14th (dates in orange) bed use is stable between d\u00e9partements and from April 15th to April 29th (dates in green) the number of beds start to go down.",

            "text": "A large number of epidemiological models are available to describe the epidemic spread and the flows between the different states, either with the simplest SIR type model (susceptible, infected, recovered), or with more complex models, such as SEIR models (susceptible, exposed/incubation state, infected, recovered/deceased see e.g. [Hethcote, 2000 ). These models can be made more complex to take into account the specifics of the particular epidemic and the available data. Many teams around the world are using official data to model the evolution of the pandemic at different scales in different countries. One can mention the resource center John Hopkins University [2020] , the work of Lavielle [2020] which gives very good adjustments for the evolution of the pandemic at the scale of each country, and on French data, a study on the pre and post lockdown periods [Di Domenico et al., 2020] . For the Grand Est region, we have also found that it is possible to give a good account of the evolution of the epidemic based on public data, in each d\u00e9partement, with classical models of the SIR or SEIR type. Another possibility is to combine public data with ICUBAM data (although the various sources are not always easy to align as illustrated in Appendix E). Nevertheless, we have obtained accurate descriptions and predictions of the number of patients in intensive care as described by ICUBAM data by modeling the underlying pandemic with a model calibrated on public data [Sant\u00e9 Publique France, 2020] for the number of hospitalized, discharged and deceased patients, and on ICUBAM data for CCB occupation. Indeed, the number of hospitalized patients is an additional element of data which is important to leverage. We may expect that the global dynamics of the number of hospitalized patients will constrain in the fits the one of the ICU patients. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that a model using only ICUBAM data gives as good results as more complex models based on both datasets. This also means that we get as good or better results with a smaller number of parameters, which suggests better predictive power for the purely ICUBAM-based model. For this reason, we present here the ICUBAM-only results. Figure 10 illustrates the model used. It is a simple SEIR model which assumes that the different d\u00e9partements are independent (the data are collected after lockdown), and uses the number of patients admitted to ICUs and the number of exits (discharged and deceased patients), but considers a lengthy time-to-exit by adding a period before exiting (ICU 1 \u2192 ICU 2 \u2192 exit) to account for the time of recovery (or death). More details are given in Appendix F. We calibrate the model parameters in order to have the best Figure 10 : Flow shart of the SEIR type model with incubation compartment. In blue, the parts corresponding to the ICUBAM data on which the model is calibrated: number of patients in ICU, cumulative number of patients leaving the ICU (X for eXit, discharged and deceased patients). agreement between the observed data and the model outcome (with a maximum likelihood criterion). The proposed family of models have predictive capabilities as shown in Figure 11 and in Figure 17 in Appendix F. The modeling allows us to see a global trajectory and the coherence of the observations in relation to the evolution of the pandemic. For example, for the Meuse d\u00e9partement in Figure  17 we can see that the observations 'catch up' with the model's predictions.",

Models of the SIR type are well suited to account for the current number of patients in intensive care and the cumulative number of discharged and deceased patients. The number of released CCBs is calculated as the difference between the change in each of these numbers between two consecutive days. For large numbers, the differences will vary greatly for small variations in the estimated quantities. For a fit calibrated on data up to 26 April, for example, a number of CCBs released during the two following days, 27 and 28 of April, is predicted which is correct for the d\u00e9partements Haut-Rhin (9, observed 6), Marne (7 or 8, observed 10), Moselle (13 or 14, observed 11), but gives a large difference for the Bas-Rhin and Meurthe-et-Moselle.

We evaluated several types of statistical models that leveraged number of ICU admissions in the preceding days as explanatory features. We ran regression models with variable selection, random forests, but also the simple average of the number of ICU admissions between 1 and 20 days before the date for which we want to predict the release. This latter simple method comes from the observation that the distribution of the number of days with invasive mechanical ventilation times is not significantly different from a Uniform distribution (see figure 12 ). Note that the data is obtained from a single hospital with a hundred of patients and should be refined. We also add, as a benchmark, the naive method that predicts the number of critical care beds released by the last observation of the number of critical care beds released.",

For example, ICUBAM's scope only covers resuscitation beds equipped with a ventilator, whereas very often critical care beds include equipped or not with ventilators. However, this implies that the number of ICU patients should be larger in the public data case, which is not always the case, as can be seen in the right panel of fig. 16 . The discrepancy in the number of patients in resuscitation at the time of reporting between the ICUBAM data and the public data is also visible in figure 16 . We have observed that the data from ICUBAM could be 'ahead' from some sources of information (sometimes by two days) indicating that they better represent the reality of the day. All rights reserved.

Consideration should also be given to the decreasing quality of the data. Thus, for some d\u00e9partements, as the Vosges, we can observe an inconsistency in the data for the last few days, suggesting a non-entry of departures, while the number of patients in ICU is decreasing.

We are interested in the posterior P (\u2126|X ) = P (X |\u2126)p(\u2126)/P (X ). The probability P (X |\u2126) is the result of the model assuming Gaussian noise. p(\u2126) is the prior on the parameters, and we choose the uniform distribution for every parameter on [0, 1]. Given the observed data X , one can then generate sets of parameters in order to cover 95% of the distribution (more precisely, we consider the 95% highest density region, see [Hyndman, 1996] ). This is done with the Slice sampling algorithm (a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm method). For each one of these sets of parameters, one generates the associated trajectoryX . The envelope of these trajectories then defines the 95% credible region. For the variance of the Gaussian noise, we choose a time-independent but d\u00e9partement specific value estimated from the data. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Since April 1st, a decrease in the daily number of patients entering the ICU of the Grand Est is visible for all d\u00e9partements. This is most likely due to the lockdown measures put in place on March 17th, which suggests a two-week delay (mean duration between time from contamination to hospital admission) in system response to confinement measures [Zhu et al., 2020] . Patient outcomes are also important for understanding the situation. Cumulative deaths, discharges (living) and transfers from ICU are presented in Figure 5 . In this Figure, we can see that both deaths and discharge statistics follow the same slope until March 27th, at which point the discharge rate increases while the death rate decreases.

One possible reason for this discrepancy is that ICU stay correlates strongly with outcome, and so patients likely to decease do so early on, whereas successful discharges happen much later. The longer time window of our study may therefore better capture the ultimate mortality rate of ICU stays. Figure 6 : Summary of patient outcomes during the studied period for each d\u00e9partement: total number of COVID-19-related deceased, discharged, or transferred patients as well as number of patients still in intensive at the end of the period. The sum of these four quantities represents the cumulative flow, over the period under consideration, of patients requiring admission to ICUs in each d\u00e9partement. Figure 7 : Number of beds occupied by COVID-19+ patients, non-COVID-19 patients, and total number of free ICU beds (regardless of COVID-19 status). The red curve represents the number of occupied beds plus the number of patients transferred to another region. Note that data before March 25th does not contain the number of transferred patients. Figure 7 shows the evolving demand and supply of CCBs in the Grand Est region. This figure also demonstrates the impressive increase in CCB capacity, going from a nominal capacity of 501 beds to 1056 beds in 12 days i.e. 211% of nominal capacity. Nevertheless, this sudden increase in capacity was not enough to satisfy the need for CCBs, and almost 600 patients had to be transferred out of r\u00e9gion to avoid surpassing the available CCB capacitys. After the pandemic's apex, the decrease in the number of occupied CCBs is observable, but evolves slowly. COVID-19 CCB bed use went from 250 to 500 in 6 days (from 03/18 to 03/24), however the decrease from 750 to 500 has taken a total of 24 days (from 03/30 to 04/23), 4 times slower than the rate of admissions. This slow rate of discharges means that the system is still over-saturated, and a second wave of admissions would be difficult to absorb.",

We have placed a dot to indicates the first date on which the nominal capacity is exceeded. The Bas-Rhin stands out, with a number of occupied beds which increased sharply on March 27. The number of people transferred was also significant at the time and started to decrease from March 30 (not represented here). As the epidemic evolved in the Grand Est region, different d\u00e9partements evolved differently in terms of CCB availability and demand. Temporal evolutions of each d\u00e9partements' CCB occupation can be compared using a correspondence analysis [Husson et al., 2017 , L\u00ea et al., 2008 . Figure 9 can be interpreted as follows: two d\u00e9partements are close if they have the same evolution over time in terms of proportion of COVID+ occupied beds, and two dates are close if the distribution of occupied beds in the different d\u00e9partements is approximately the same. For the interpretation of the positions of a date and a d\u00e9partement, we can say that a d\u00e9partement goes towards the dates it is the most associated with, and away from dates it is the least associated with: a d\u00e9partement is associated to a date if the number of occupied beds is high for this d\u00e9partement at this date comparing to what happen in this d\u00e9partement in the other dates, and also comparing to what happen at this date in the other d\u00e9partements. What is noticeable is that we can observe three clusters 3 of temporal behavior: between the 18 and 26 March (dates in red) the bed use increases significantly, between March 27th and April 14th (dates in orange) bed use is stable between d\u00e9partements and from April 15th to April 29th (dates in green) the number of beds start to go down.",

            "text": "A large number of epidemiological models are available to describe the epidemic spread and the flows between the different states, either with the simplest SIR type model (susceptible, infected, recovered), or with more complex models, such as SEIR models (susceptible, exposed/incubation state, infected, recovered/deceased see e.g. [Hethcote, 2000 ). These models can be made more complex to take into account the specifics of the particular epidemic and the available data. Many teams around the world are using official data to model the evolution of the pandemic at different scales in different countries. One can mention the resource center John Hopkins University [2020] , the work of Lavielle [2020] which gives very good adjustments for the evolution of the pandemic at the scale of each country, and on French data, a study on the pre and post lockdown periods [Di Domenico et al., 2020] . For the Grand Est region, we have also found that it is possible to give a good account of the evolution of the epidemic based on public data, in each d\u00e9partement, with classical models of the SIR or SEIR type. Another possibility is to combine public data with ICUBAM data (although the various sources are not always easy to align as illustrated in Appendix E). Nevertheless, we have obtained accurate descriptions and predictions of the number of patients in intensive care as described by ICUBAM data by modeling the underlying pandemic with a model calibrated on public data [Sant\u00e9 Publique France, 2020] for the number of hospitalized, discharged and deceased patients, and on ICUBAM data for CCB occupation. Indeed, the number of hospitalized patients is an additional element of data which is important to leverage. We may expect that the global dynamics of the number of hospitalized patients will constrain in the fits the one of the ICU patients. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that a model using only ICUBAM data gives as good results as more complex models based on both datasets. This also means that we get as good or better results with a smaller number of parameters, which suggests better predictive power for the purely ICUBAM-based model. For this reason, we present here the ICUBAM-only results. Figure 10 illustrates the model used. It is a simple SEIR model which assumes that the different d\u00e9partements are independent (the data are collected after lockdown), and uses the number of patients admitted to ICUs and the number of exits (discharged and deceased patients), but considers a lengthy time-to-exit by adding a period before exiting (ICU 1 \u2192 ICU 2 \u2192 exit) to account for the time of recovery (or death). More details are given in Appendix F. We calibrate the model parameters in order to have the best Figure 10 : Flow shart of the SEIR type model with incubation compartment. In blue, the parts corresponding to the ICUBAM data on which the model is calibrated: number of patients in ICU, cumulative number of patients leaving the ICU (X for eXit, discharged and deceased patients). agreement between the observed data and the model outcome (with a maximum likelihood criterion). The proposed family of models have predictive capabilities as shown in Figure 11 and in Figure 17 in Appendix F. The modeling allows us to see a global trajectory and the coherence of the observations in relation to the evolution of the pandemic. For example, for the Meuse d\u00e9partement in Figure  17 we can see that the observations 'catch up' with the model's predictions.",

Models of the SIR type are well suited to account for the current number of patients in intensive care and the cumulative number of discharged and deceased patients. The number of released CCBs is calculated as the difference between the change in each of these numbers between two consecutive days. For large numbers, the differences will vary greatly for small variations in the estimated quantities. For a fit calibrated on data up to 26 April, for example, a number of CCBs released during the two following days, 27 and 28 of April, is predicted which is correct for the d\u00e9partements Haut-Rhin (9, observed 6), Marne (7 or 8, observed 10), Moselle (13 or 14, observed 11), but gives a large difference for the Bas-Rhin and Meurthe-et-Moselle. This can be understood by looking at figure 17 : the predicted trajectory deviates slightly from the data, with the formation of quasi plateau that a SIR model cannot account for.

We evaluated several types of statistical models that leveraged number of ICU admissions in the preceding days as explanatory features. We ran regression models with variable selection, random forests, but also the simple average of the number of ICU admissions between 1 and 20 days before the date for which we want to predict the release. This latter simple method comes from the observation that the distribution of the number of days with invasive mechanical ventilation times is not significantly different from a Uniform distribution (see figure 12 ). Note that the data is obtained from a single hospital with a hundred of patients and should be refined. We also add, as a benchmark, the naive method that predicts the number of critical care beds released by the last observation of the number of critical care beds released.",

Remarkably, the observations seem to 'catch up' with the model's prediction. Similarly, for the Meuse d\u00e9partement, on the last dates the data 'come back' onto the model trajectory. Consideration should also be given to the decreasing quality of the data. Thus, for some d\u00e9partements, as the Vosges, we can observe an inconsistency in the data for the last few days, suggesting a non-entry of departures, while the number of patients in ICU is decreasing. The correct number of patients leaving the ICU is thus slightly increasing in the last days, in better agreement with the model predictions.",

We are interested in the posterior P (\u2126|X ) = P (X |\u2126)p(\u2126)/P (X ). The probability P (X |\u2126) is the result of the model assuming Gaussian noise. p(\u2126) is the prior on the parameters, and we choose the uniform distribution for every parameter on [0, 1]. Given the observed data X , one can then generate sets of parameters in order to cover 95% of the distribution (more precisely, we consider the 95% highest density region, see [Hyndman, 1996] ). This is done with the Slice sampling algorithm (a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm method). For each one of these sets of parameters, one generates the associated trajectoryX . The envelope of these trajectories then defines the 95% credible region. For the variance of the Gaussian noise, we choose a time-independent but d\u00e9partement specific value estimated from the data. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

He started to develop a prototype on March 18, 2020 to collect the data on the availability of beds by placing phone calls and centralizing the information in a spreadsheet. ICUBAM development began on Sunday March 22, 2020 after a meeting between Antoine and team of engineers and researchers from Polytechnique, Inria, and elsewhere. On Wednesday March 25, 2020, we launched ICUBAM in the Grand Est r\u00e9gion in agreement with the ARS (Regional Health Agency). Other regions quickly started using ICUBAM (Center Val-de-Loire, Brittany, AURA, New Aquitaine, etc.). ICUBAM is currently used by 130 ICUs in 40 d\u00e9partements, which represents more than 2,000 COVID-19 CCBs.",

This messages contains as token, that is generated specifically for a given user of a given ICU. ICUBAM also supports automatic refreshing of tokens periodically.This link containing the token is needed to access the the availability form in which the user can easily enter the 8 counts described in this document.
