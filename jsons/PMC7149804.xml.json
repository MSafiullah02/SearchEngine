            "text": "It is thought that plants may have evolved protective mechanisms to guard them from ingestion by predatory herbivorous animals. These protective mechanisms, or \u201cantiquality factors,\u201d fall into two groups: metabolic inhibitors and plant structural matter resistant to digestion by animal enzymes. It is the second that is of interest when discussing rabbit digestion. Plant substances may be divided into elements involved with metabolism and elements providing the structural matter of the cell wall. The elements involved with metabolism are digestible by animals; the structural portions possess unique components that are not. Plant cell walls can be synthesized but not degraded by the plant cell; animal digestive enzymes cannot degrade these structures either. Only bacteria and some fungi have enzymes to degrade these substances, and the use of this material as food by herbivores depends on a symbiotic association with gastrointestinal organisms with the requisite ability to degrade plant structural matter. The storage carbohydrate starch differs from structural cellulose only in the stereochemical linkage of the glucose units (\u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively).2\n",

            "text": "Resistance to digestion arises from several features of the chemical structure. Occurrence of linkages for which no animal enzyme is secreted allows the possibility of fermentation. Microbial enzymes exist that will hydrolyze most glycosidic linkages occurring in plant walls. Polysaccharides will be fermented if the bond is accessible to the enzyme. The galactans that occur in many legumes and their seeds are resistant to animal digestive enzymes but are storage compounds relative to the plant and thus form an exception to the rule that most resistant carbohydrates are in the fibrous elements. Galactans are rapidly fermented and are responsible for flatus. Cellulose and hemicellulose are fermentable to some extent by microorganisms. Cellulose is less digestible than is hemicellulose. The main difference between legumes, such as alfalfa, and grasses is the much higher amount of hemicellulose of different types of grass.42 Lignin is the main noncarbohydrate component of plant fiber and offers another kind of resistance to biologic degradation. Lignin is an aromatic polymer containing a condensed, continuous carbon-to-carbon linkage system of bonding that offers no possibility of hydrolytic cleavage.",

            "text": "Rabbit diets high in fiber have been shown to have a protective effect against enteritis. The beneficial effect is associated with the indigestible component lignin, commonly known as fiber. The digestible carbohydrate sources do not afford the same protection. Fiber stimulates cecocolic motility, either directly or by a distention effect of the bulk. Conversely, diets low in fiber cause cecocolic hypomotility, which predisposes rabbits to abnormal cecal fermentation and prolonged retention of digesta in the cecum; they also stimulate volatile fatty acid production, alter pH and substrate concentrations, and ultimately produce changes in cecal microflora. Other effects of fiber consumption are indirect. High-fiber diets have a low level of available carbohydrate and thus decrease the risk of enterotoxemia caused by carbohydrate overload of the hindgut. Carbohydrates provide an environment in which pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Clostridium species proliferate. Glucose, a byproduct of carbohydrate digestion, is necessary for the production of iota toxin by Clostridium species.",

This syndrome certainly exists in rabbits that have not ingested large amounts of hair; the material in the stomach may primarily consist of ingested food.

The most commonly implicated object is a mat of hair. In contrast to the trichobezoars found in the pet cat or ferret, hair found in a rabbit appears to have become matted while still on the coat of the animal rather than in its stomach. Obstruction from carpet fiber or plastic foreign bodies may present similarly. Gastric and intestinal obstructions are life threatening, and affected rabbits must be treated rapidly and aggressively if they are to survive. Treatment consists of the administration of analgesics, such as buprenorphine (0.01-0.05 mg/kg SC, IM q12h) or flunixin meglumine (0.3-2.0 mg/kg SC, IM q12h for no more than 3 days); a shock dose of intravenous or intraosseous crystalloid solution; and short-acting corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone sodium succinate (10 mg/kg IV; Solu-Cortef, The Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, MI) or prednisolone sodium succinate (11-25 mg/kg IV; Solu-Delta Cortef, The Upjohn Company). Take radiographs to confirm the location of gas. In some rabbits, a tube can be passed into the stomach for decompression. Most often, this is performed with the patient under isoflurane anesthesia, either while radiographs are being taken or while the rabbit is being prepared for surgery.

Its cause is unknown; however, studies have convincingly established the relation between bacterial dysbiosis and hyperacidity of the cecum and the symptoms of mucoid enteritis.31 Alterations in cecal pH resulting from changes in the production or absorption of volatile fatty acids or from vigorous fermentation of carbohydrates can destabilize the cecal microbial population and stimulate mucus production within the cecum and colon. Feeding a diet high in fiber and low in simple carbohydrates is preventative.",

C. spiroforme has been shown to be sensitive to vancomycin, bacitracin, metronidazole, and penicillin G.8 The use of metronidazole (20 mg/kg IV, PO q12h) has been reported to reduce the number of deaths from enterotoxemia. Correction of dehydration and maintenance of normal hydration are of paramount importance, and administration of intravenous or intraosseous fluids often is indicated.

Diarrhea in rabbits is most often caused by a strain similar to EPEC, which causes chronic diarrhea in human infants. This strain, called rabbit enteropathogenic E. coli (rabbit EPEC), also referred to in the literature as rabbit diarrhea E. coli (RDEC-1), is considered an attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC) because of its capability of attaching and effacing the intestinal microvillous border with adhesin or adhesion factor.37 AEEC strains include both EPEC and certain strains of EHEC bacteria. EPEC strains do not express the high levels of shiga toxin that are characteristic of EHEC strains, but all AEEC strains have a common genetic code to produce factors necessary to produce attaching and effacing lesions.

The disease is most often characterized as an acute diarrhea disease of rabbits 2 to 4 months of age (weanlings). Proliferative enteritis (PE) or enteropathy is an enteric disease that develops in many animals. Much of the literature focuses on the disease in swine and hamsters. In addition, PE has been reported in rats and guinea pigs; ungulates other than swine, including white-tailed deer, sheep, and horses; carnivores, including arctic foxes, dogs, ferrets, and nonhuman primates; and birds (ratites). The disease is not an important problem in these other species.41 Histologic findings in these cases most often show a proliferative ileitis, with or without proliferative colitis, characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and mucosal inflammation. Similar disease in pigs and ferrets has been shown to be caused by a similar but distinctively different bacterium, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans.25, 35 Treatment of L. intracellularis in rabbits is challenging. Antibiotics used to treat L. intracellularis in other species include those of the macrolide family (e.g., tylocin, erythromycin, and lincomycin). These antibiotics are not recommended for use in rabbits. Chloramphenicol is generally efficacious and is administered at 30-50 mg/kg PO, SC q12h for 7 to 14 days. Florfenicol (NuFlor, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp., Union, NJ) is a new antibiotic that may be useful as an antimicrobial agent in rabbits, but its efficacy and potential side effects in this species need to be evaluated.",

Clinical signs of Tyzzer's disease include watery diarrhea, depression, and death. Morbidity and mortality rates may be especially high in weanling rabbits. Older rabbits can have a more chronic form of the disease develop that results in chronic weight loss. Postmortem examination of rabbits with Tyzzer's disease may show the characteristic foci of necrosis in the liver and degenerative lesions of the myocardium. More often, the intestinal wall is edematous, with areas of necrosis in the mucosa of the proximal colon. Treatment is palliative once clinical signs have been observed. The intracellular location of the bacteria may contribute to the difficulty in treating affected animals. If exposed animals are treated early (if they are isolated from affected animals, good hygiene is promoted, and supportive care and a high fiber diet are provided), they may not develop the disease. Once symptoms of the disease develop, treatment may be unsuccessful. Prevention of the disease depends on good husbandry.

Severity of diarrhea associated with rotavirus infection varies widely and is likely influenced by synergy with various microorganisms associated with the infection. Severe anorexia, dehydration, and mucoid or greenish-yellow watery diarrhea have been reported. Rabbits between 30 and 80 days of age are most often affected. The mortality rate in young rabbits with naturally occurring infections may be as high as 80%. In experimental studies, rotavirus caused soft or fluid feces in some rabbits, but in most animals, diarrhea did not develop at all.9 One study showed that a strain of rotavirus induced diarrhea, depression, anorexia, and death; however, results of the experiment was not reproducible.16, 17 The clinical signs of naturally occurring infections involving rotavirus and other agents include marked congestion and distention of the intestines and cecum and petechial hemorrhages in the small intestine and colon. Histologic lesions include moderate to severe villous atrophy, with the most severe lesions found in the ileum. Apical enterocytes on the tips of villi are swollen, rounded, and desquamating, and the tips may be denuded. The lamina propria is usually infiltrated with lymphocytes and, occasionally, with neutrophils. Diagnosis is established on the basis of the results of histopathologic examination of the intestine, isolation of the virus, or demonstration of antibodies. Clinical signs and gross pathologic findings alone are not diagnostic.15 The prevention and control of rotavirus infection is complicated by its highly infectious nature.

The first report of RCD in the western hemisphere was in 1988, when the disease was detected in domestic rabbits in the Mexico City area. The outbreak was traced to a shipment of 18 metric tons of frozen rabbit carcasses from China that had been delivered to a supermarket chain outside Mexico City. In 1989, the Mexican government began a control and eradication program that included quarantine of infected farms; prohibition of movement or sale of rabbits, voluntary destruction of diseased rabbits; and cleaning, disinfecting, and repopulating premises after a 2-month waiting period. The campaign was successful. Mexico is the only country to succeed in eradicating RCD.",

Transmission is horizontal, with fecal-oral spread being the major route. However, fomites such as water sipper tubes, feed, and utensils can transmit the virus. The virus enters the rabbit through the conjunctiva, nasal passages, or traumatized tissue. The course of the disease is acute, with the duration of incubation only 1 to 2 days. RCD is highly infectious and has traditionally been associated with both high morbidity rates (70%-80%) and high mortality rates (100%). The number of rabbits affected during outbreaks peaks in 2 to 3 days, and the disease course may last only 7 to 13 days. Initially, affected rabbits are febrile and show signs of depression, lethargy, and anorexia. Some may show signs of tachypnea, cyanosis, abdominal distention, and constipation or diarrhea. At the end stage of the disease, the rabbit becomes hypothermic and recumbent and may have convulsions or epistaxis. Because of the rapid course of the disease, signs may not be noticed, and the affected rabbit is found dead. Surviving rabbits exhibit depression, anorexia, and fever that may last for 2 to 3 days.",

Infection results from ingestion of sporulated oocysts that undergo excystation in the duodenum. Liberated sporozoites penetrate the intestinal mucosa and move to bile epithelial cells, where they undergo schizogony. Merozoites invade contiguous epithelial cells and undergo gametogeny, which develop into microgametes and macrogametes. After being fertilized by a microgamete, the macrogamete develops into an oocyst. Oocysts rupture from the epithelial cells and are passed in the bile and, eventually, in the feces.28 In mild infections, the symptom is unapparent retardation of growth; however, the disease may be fatal, especially in young rabbits. Heavily infected rabbits show signs related to the interference of hepatic function and the blockage of bile ducts. Infected rabbits become anorexic and debilitated; diarrhea or constipation may be noted in the terminal stages of the disease. The abdomen is occasionally enlarged and icterus is observed. On radiographs, the liver may appear enlarged and ascites may be present. On postmortem examination, the liver is enlarged and has yellowish-white, nodular, abscesslike lesions of varying size, some of which are within a fibrous capsule. The gallbladder often is enlarged by exudate. Diagnosis is based on the identification of oocysts in a sample of bile, by histologic examination, or by fecal examination.",

Infections are usually not apparent. Clinical signs are most often seen in young rabbits. Weight loss, mild intermittent to severe diarrhea that may contain mucus or blood, and dehydration may be observed. Animals with severe diarrhea may develop intussusception. Death most often is attributed to dehydration and secondary bacterial infections. Postmortem examination reveals lesions in the small or large intestine, depending on the agent involved.

            "text": "Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites of fungi, produced primarily by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. When feed that contains aflatoxins is ingested, a complex metabolic pathway is created for removing this toxin from the body. There are four different aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus; AFB1, B2, G1, and G2, but the aflatoxin of main concern is aflatoxin B1 because of its role in carcinogenesis. In its natural state, aflatoxin B1 is not toxigenic. It becomes harmful when it enters the body and is recognized as a foreign substance and is metabolized initially to B8,9-epoxide by cytochrome P450 subfamilies and specific isoforms. A major detoxification pathway that the body uses is the conjugation of B8,9-epoxide with glutathione. This process is catalyzed by glutathione-S-transferase. Aflatoxin B1-8,9-epoxide and AFB2a are intermediates of the most active metabolite, AFB-dihydrodiol. The production of AFB-dihydrodiol is an attempt made by the body at detoxification. This pathway is used to a lesser extent. The epoxide is converted into a dihydrodiol because of the actions of epoxide hydrolase. Aflatoxin B-dihydrodiol is further metabolized to form AFM1, AFQ1, and AFP1, which form glucuronides and sulfate conjugates that are excreted in the urine and feces.10 The LD50 for aflatoxins in rabbits is among the lowest for any species studied.13 Levels of aflatoxin B1 greater than 100 ppm in the diet of rabbits have been shown to be associated with morbidity and death.33 In one outbreak of aflatoxicosis in angora rabbits, affected animals had anorexia, dullness, and weight loss followed by jaundice in terminal stages. Death occurred within 3 to 4 days of the appearance of clinical signs. On postmortem examination, livers were moderately to severely congested, icteric, and were hard to cut. Gallbladders were distended and had inspissated bile. Liver sections showed degenerative changes of hepatic cells along with dilatation and engorgement of sinusoids. Bile ducts had mild to severe periportal fibrosis. Focal areas of pseudolobulation and regenerative foci were also predominant. The level of aflatoxin B1 in feed samples from various farms submitted at the time of the investigation varied from 90 to 540 \u03bcg aflatoxin B1/kg of feed. Withdrawal of feed and supplementary therapy resulted in gradual disappearance of signs and death.29\n",
