Numerous researches on CRM have made significant progress in several areas such as telecommunications, banking, and manufacturing, but research specific to the healthcare environment is very limited. This systematic review aims to categorise, summarise, synthesise, and appraise the research on CRM in the healthcare environment, considering the absence of coherent and comprehensive scholarship of disparate data on CRM. Various databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search of studies that examine CRM in the healthcare environment (including hospitals, clinics, medical centres, and nursing homes). Analysis and evaluation of 19 carefully selected studies revealed three main research categories: (i) social CRM 'eCRM'; (ii) implementing CRMS; and (iii) adopting CRMS; with positive outcomes for CRM both in terms of patients relationship/communication with hospital, satisfaction, medical treatment/outcomes and empowerment and hospitals medical operation, productivity, cost, performance, efficiency and service quality. This is the first systematic review to comprehensively synthesise and summarise empirical evidence from disparate CRM research data (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed) in the healthcare environment. Our results revealed that substantial gaps exist in the knowledge of using CRM in the healthcare environment. Future research should focus on exploring: (i) other potential factors, such as patient characteristics, culture (of both the patient and hospital), knowledge management, trust, security, and privacy for implementing and adopting CRMS and (ii) other CRM categories, such as mobile CRM (mCRM) and data mining CRM.",

From a healthcare perspective, Benz and Paddison [22] defined CRM as 'an approach to learn about patients in order to communicate appropriately, and to build good relationships in order to deliver timely information, with the patient's results tracked to make necessary adjustments'. In this study, we embrace a balanced perspective, and define CRM in the healthcare environment as a managerial approach and healthcare information technology (HIT) application that supports the concept of patient-centric care. This allows hospitals to focus more on patients to meet their needs and expectations, improve loyalty, service quality (SQ), and build a long-term relationship.",

            "text": "The use of IT is essential for executing CRM, Yina [23] pointed out that effective CRM requires comprehensive data collection from both inpatients and outpatients through a multi-media platform, as well as integrating CRMS with various clinical networks such as hospital information systems (HIS), electronic health records (EHR), laboratory information systems (LIS), hospital web platforms, call centres, and SMS-based systems [23, 24] . This requires healthcare providers to possess IT resources such as hardware, software, and infrastructure, to implement CRMS and store patient records more efficiently. Healthcare providers may be able to achieve patient loyalty if they considered two key factors: (i) the number of patients, and (ii) patient profit. The more 'loyal patients' a hospital has, the less investments it must make, the greater the profits it can gain, and vice versa. McDonald [25] stated that life-long value of a patient involves two major aspects: (i) the 'core relationship' which consists of a variety of uses of 'frequency' and confirming loyalty through 'commitment'; and (ii) the 'extended relationship', which consists of product commercialisation such as 'communication tools' and word of-mouth 'recommendations'. Furthermore, chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and cardiac failure, require continuous follow-up and selfmanagement. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare providers to know that certain patients require multiple healthcare services, and it is important to maintain high quality medical services and long-term relationships, which will eventually create long-life value [26] .",

Also, while many studies have attempted to review various HIT innovations and applications [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] , no systematic review has been conducted on CRM research with a focus on healthcare settings. However, the first systematic literature review to comprehensively investigate the CRM mechanisms from an information system (IS) perspective was performed by Soltani and Navimipour [58] . Twenty-seven studies between 2009 and 2015 were included in the review. The main objective of this work was to explore five common categories of CRM techniques with regards to the IS. These categories were; knowledge management (KM), E-CRM, data mining, social CRM and data quality. While this study focused on CRM mechanisms from IS perspective, our study focuses on CRMS in the healthcare environment. Filling this gap allows a significant contribution to be made, particularly on the issues of consumer e-health, patient engagement, and patient-centric care. For this purpose, we have undertaken a systematic literature review (SLR) of the empirical evidence regarding CRM research in the healthcare environment over the past two decades. Accordingly, we set out to answer the following key research questions:",

            "text": "Health information technology (HIT, also known as e-health or medical informatics [5] ), is viewed as a significant tool to achieve cost savings, efficiency, quality, and safety [6] [7] [8] . The benefits of HIT include: improved medical services and workflows, providing decisionmaking support and clinical information for medical professionals, expanding the quality, safety, and effectiveness of patient care, preventing medical errors; and reducing expenses, admissions, and paperwork [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Many studies suggest that the effectiveness of implementing HIT will determine the success and survival of the healthcare industry. Consumer e-health, patient engagement, and patient-centric care also play significant roles in delivering high quality medical services and meeting patient needs [17] . Many studies have found that the more patients are involved in their own health, the better outcomes in terms of quality, cost, and performance [18] [19] [20] . Healthcare providers now see the patient more clearly as the end consumer of medical services; thus, as in any kind of business, the concept of patient satisfaction and loyalty has become healthcare organisations' foremost concern [2] . This paper is organised as follows, Section 2 illustrates our review methodology which describes the search strategy, keywords used, selection process, critical appraisal, data collection and analysis. Section 3 presents and summarises the key findings of the selected studies. The main findings with response to the research questions, strength and limitations of the review as well as future work suggestions are discussed in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes the paper.",

The authors of [77] argued that the CRM framework proposed by Cheng et al. [74] was inappropriate because their results were obtained from a value characteristic questionnaire. However, the two sub-dimensions of CM, 'interactive mechanism' and 'assessment of demand models', did not clearly map all the attributes defined in the survey. Accordingly, similar to the work of [74] , Gulliver et al. [77] adapted a value characteristic framework to support establishing CRM in nursing homes. This study found the most three significant dimensions to be: the 'behaviour of service personnel', the 'design of care processes', and 'support from related units'. Based on the findings, the authors claimed that approaches to executing CRM in nursing homes would be inappropriate if only one solution was considered to fulfil all the attributes. Accounting for each attribute would ensure consistency, relevancy, and provide an effective, focused plan. While allowing each individual characteristic to be linked to a specific CRM solution type would support the practical implementation of CRM, we believe the adapted framework could also assist hospitals, especially in terms of answering the following questions: (1) what are the most valuable elements of putting CRM into practice? and (2) How can we link each feature to a CRM solution type?",

They administered a survey to 243 CRM system users from 13 health promotion centres to validate the aforementioned IS model. The outcomes showed that (1) the CRM model was feasible; (2) of system attributes, only 'information quality' and 'SQ' had a significant influence and relationship with 'perceived usefulness' and 'user satisfaction' and (3) 'perceived usefulness' and 'user satisfaction' had a significant impact on 'personal performance' as well as an indirect effect on 'organisational performance'. The authors of [81] surveyed 615 staff members in 108 privately run and 30 hospital-based nursing homes to assess CRM implementation. The author adapted the CRM scale developed by Sin et al. [82] , which involves four dimensions: (1) a key customer focus; (2) CRM organisation; (3) technology-based CRM and (4) KM, along with 23 subdimensions. However, in this study, only 18 sub-dimensions were adapted to evaluate CRM implementation. Furthermore, the study found that the two types of nursing homes had different ways of building relationships with residents. Hospital-based nursing homes leaned toward understanding patients' needs and delivering prompt medical service through the concept of 'knowledge learning'. Private nursing homes focused on 'CRM organisation' and 'technology-based CRM' to foster personal connections with residents. Another CRM implementation model was introduced by Zamani and Tarokh [83] , this model consists of seven components; Customer satisfaction, loyalty, trust, expectations, perceptions, perceived quality and Architecture. A total of 303 patients were surveyed and found that All seven components were significant and have relationship with each other. Also, the authors of [84] designed a CRM implementation model based on HR factors such as employee satisfaction, organizational culture, communication management, empowerment, organizational commitment, organizational structure and change management. This work surveyed 215 managers of a university hospital. Findings revealed that HRM plays a crucial role in the implementation of CRMS. However, the employee satisfaction factor had the highest influence on the implementation of CRMS.",

We found three main CRM research categories: (1) e-CRM (N = 5, 26%); (2) implementing CRM (N = 11, 58%); and (3) adopting CRM (N = 3, 16%). We proposed an introductory framework that organises all three aspects. Fig. 9 presents a framework for categorising CRM research in the healthcare environment, beginning with social web-based CRM (e-CRM). This means that all CRM applications, functions and features are used through the internet environment. This also suggests that hospitals should manage all forms of communication and relationships with their patients through Web 2.0 and social media technologies. Consistent with this, Kohli et al. [69] explored a Web-based CRM application called a PPS, finding positive results in several areas, such as the physician-hospital relationship, medical operations, patient satisfaction, and clinical outcomes (especially in nutrition and neurology). However, the results of this study were based on physician case studies, and empirical data from a cost/benefit analysis of PPS performance during and after its implementation. It would have been more efficient if patients were involved in the case study, to know whether executing PPS had a direct influence and/or relationship with patients. Adding to this, Anshari et al. [70] proposed a CRM 2.0 model to determine patient expectations of e-health services. This study also showed a positive outcome regarding empowerment of patients through the web, given that more than 70% of participants (patients) wished to view their electronic medical records online, as well as make appointments and payments, and obtain consultations and referrals. Only one study proposed a framework for establishing social CRM (i.e. eCRM), and identified key factors based on importance and priorities [71] . Hence, more research is needed to better understand this element in healthcare organisations.",

Today, more and more of patient personal and health information (PHI) is being stored in CRMS, many of these data are created by doctors, clinics and hospitals and they offer plenty of advantages such as reducing medical mistakes, sharing information easier and offering better care. Whether PHI is maintained in a paper record or an electronic health record, patients have the right to keep it private, and that privacy is protected by laws called health insurance portability and accountability act (HIPPA) [92] and general data protection regulation (GDPR) [93] . These laws require that certain healthcare providers keep PHI private and secure encrypted form and proper journalised history from its inception. Firewalls, strong encryption, secure login, access control and authentication mechanisms are some of the security measures that healthcare providers may or should use to protect the privacy of patients when implementing CRMS. As patient's privacy continues to evolve, certain policies and guidelines need to be followed to properly control access, disclose and protect PHI under all circumstances to avoid misuse and litigations. Hence, we suggest that future research further focuses on patient public and private information, privacy and security perceptions and how these might influence the implementation and adoption of CRMS in open environments.",

We believe patient with chronic illness could greatly benefit from m-CRM in multiple ways, allowing for immediate medical responses and new symptom and diagnoses detection methods and procedures. Therefore, we recommend more research that addresses m-CRM in healthcare functionality and the issue of privacy and security of both patients as well as all healthcare workers.

Our search and selection process went through different phases to degrade the findings. In total, 19 studies were carefully identified and analysed. Each study was evaluated by following the criteria of quality assessment tools for undertaking a systematic review of disparate data developed by Hawker et al. [66] . The findings were qualitatively and quantitatively organised based on three main research categories; e-CRM (Web-based CRM), implementing CRMS, and adopting CRMS. The selected studies were published between 2000 and 2020. Our results indicate that research and development on CRM within the healthcare environment is still in its early stages in uncharted waters, and more research would be helpful.
