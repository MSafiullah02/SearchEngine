Warning signs for complications include abdominal pain developing after the third day of illness and a falling platelet count. Severe disease is most common in persons <15 years of age and in those having their second dengue infection. Second dengue infections predispose to severe infection because cross-protective immunity among the four dengue serotypes is limited. The poorly cross-neutralising antibody resulting from a previous infection results in increased uptake of dengue virus into antigen-presenting cells with an associated increase in viral replication and enhanced pathogenesis. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue infection. The relative risk for developing severe dengue in secondary compared with primary infection may be as high as 25-fold. However, it is unusual to develop complications after a third episode of dengue infection. The case-fatality rate of severe dengue in most countries is about 5%.

Condoms remain the most commonly used HIV/STI prevention method worldwide and, when used successfully, are very effective at preventing HIV transmission. However, real-world effectiveness of condoms is dependent on someone putting one on before sex, keeping it on until the end of the act of sex, and where necessary using appropriate lubricant to prevent condom rupture during sex. These caveats mean that the real-world effectiveness of condoms in preventing HIV is not 100%. Travellers are more likely to use condoms if they bring condoms from home, so encourage patients to pack these in their suitcase.Consider prescribing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for individuals at medium to high risk of HIV exposure. HIV PrEP involves the use of antiretroviral medication by someone who is HIV negative to reduce the risk of becoming infected with HIV. It is recommended that PrEP be taken every day to minimise HIV risk. HIV PrEP (tenofovir/emtricitabine 300/200 mg) is now available on the Australian PBS. Resources for HIV PrEP are listed at the end of this chapter.Do not share needles or drug-injecting equipment, and take care when handling, using and disposing of needles or other sharp items.Avoid any procedure involving skin penetration, including tattooing, body piercing, shaving, dental work and medical procedures.\n",

Sexual transmission from both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases may follow unprotected male-to-female, male-to-male and female-to-male sex.
