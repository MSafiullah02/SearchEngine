Epidemic diseases are diseases where the number of cases \u201cspikes\u201d, or temporarily exceeds established baseline caseloads. What constitutes an epidemic will depend on the nature and prior history of the pathogenic agent. Features of the exposed population including its size and susceptibility to the pathogen, and the spatio-temporal characteristics of the outbreak are all factors that are used to define whether an epidemic is occurring. Taking Dengue as an example, an epidemic could be characterised by substantial increase in caseloads in an area where Dengue has an established moderate baseline of cases, or if a small number of cases were to emerge in an area that had no prior history of Dengue. Cases of previously unseen pathogenic agents may only need to be small in number in order to be identified as epidemic.

The novel virus emerged via the process of reassortment, where two different strains of influenza, one endemic in North American pigs and the other in Eurasian pigs, infected the same animal. The two viruses exchanged genetic material (RNA) to result in a new virus significantly different from its precursors. This antigenic shift means that the immune systems of humans and swine have never been exposed to this disease before and therefore do not possess the antibodies to halt infection. This coupled with the property that it was relatively readily transmissible resulted in large swaths of the world population being infected (Smith et al. 2009).

The most commonly used models are called population (compartmental) models. Developments by WH Hamer, Sir Ronald Ross and Kermack and McKendrick between 1910 and 1930 resulted in the core mathematical models that continue to be used to understand and predict the transmission of infectious diseases today (Kermack and McKendrick 1927). These deterministic dynamical models have been extended to stochastic variants for use under certain circumstances, and for modelling diseases with other modes of transmission than those originally studied, as well as for studying endemic and endemo-epidemic diseases. Age structure and spatial structure have been introduced as further features to the dynamical models. More detailed spatial structure between subpopulations, taking account of social groups and travel patterns, captures a subclass of pandemic models with increased spatial heterogeneity. Network models of infectious disease take advantage of modern computing power and increased amounts of readily available social network data to model transmission based on models of individual people\u2019s contacts with others in their social groups. Agent-based models go one step further and explicitly model the interactions of individual hosts, vectors (if applicable) and pathogenic agents, thus removing some of the assumptions underlying the dynamical models and attempting to generate real-world epidemic behaviour directly from the interactions of the agents.5\n",

For this to happen, there needs to be low residual immunity in the population: it is emerging or re-emerging pathogens that are likely to give rise to pandemics. Moreover, in an unconventional risk transfer context, the principal use case is to model the risk of emergence of a novel pathogen capable of reaching pandemic scale, and subsequently the size, scale and impact of that pandemic. It is for this reason that industry focuses its attention on population models with spatial heterogeneity: they are able to capture the large-scale behaviour of pandemics relevant to counterparties involved in risk transfer transactions.",

We have already encountered the term susceptible, which is one such compartment that includes anybody who could be infected if they came into contact with an infectious host. Infective is another such compartment, which is populated by hosts capable of transmitting the disease to susceptible members of the population. To complete one of the most basic compartmental models of epidemic behaviour, the SIR (susceptible-infective-recovered) model, we introduce a recovered compartment, which includes those removed from the susceptible population, as they are now immune to infection. The sum of the three compartments is the total size of the population (Fig. 15.4).\n",

This captures the logical idea that susceptibles coming into contact with many people are increasingly likely to encounter an infective host as the number of total infectives rises. The rate of recovery, \u03b3, is assumed to be constant in the usual formulation of the SIR model. These epidemiological parameters can be combined to yield a powerful descriptor for the transmissibility of an infectious disease, which combines the population characteristics and behaviour with the communicability of the pathogen. This is the basic reproduction number, R\n0, which is the expected number of people an infective would infect in an otherwise fully susceptible population. For sustained transmission and an epidemic to occur, R\n0 in an SIR model and other similar models must be greater than one. There are various derived terms with their foundations in the basic reproduction number, such as effective R\n0 (R\u2032 is a measure of reproduction number contingent on the existing immune fraction of the population) and R\nt (a measure of reproduction number as an epidemic progresses over time). Table 15.3 provides R\n0 values for some key historical pandemics and other epidemic diseases.\n",

Often, there is a latent period where the levels of pathogen are building up in the host and during which the host is not yet infective. This is termed the exposed compartment, and its effects are demonstrated in Fig. 15.5. In both the SIR and SEIR deterministic models, for a disease with R\n0 > 1, the number of infectives (the effective caseload in these models) undergoes exponential growth until it reaches a peak, after which the number of susceptibles available to infect has significantly diminished, resulting in an inflection point where caseloads begin to fall.\n",

These assumptions may be reasonable approximations to the truth during the peak and late stages of a large epidemic or pandemic. However, consider the case of a novel pathogen. The basic deterministic SEIR model\u2019s initial conditions are based on the concept of a well-mixed proportion of the population starting as infective, whereas in the real-world scenario, there is a single person (index case) that is infective. The subsequent course of the disease will depend on the behaviour of that person and the local characteristics of the population in that area. Thus, while the R\n0 may be less than or greater than one when assuming the population is perfectly mixed, whether an epidemic will happen will be uncertain and dependent on a small number of human interactions during these early stages of an outbreak. Introducing demographic stochasticity to the model can improve the realism of this feature (Diekmann and Heesterbeek 2000).

Such models can range from the relatively simple where the coupling is homogeneous and requires only minor extensions to the compartmental models described above, to the complex. Heterogeneous coupling and network models of detailed population dynamics such as commuting and travel patterns can be taken into account in such models. Such additional complexity is accompanied by a need to infer additional parameters, which can be done to varying degrees of success depending on the complexity of the model and the availability of data globally (Ball et al. 1997; Colizza and Vespignani 2008). The contact features of metapopulation and network models are described schematically in Fig. 15.7.\n",

A more sophisticated approach is to use a Bayesian approach to estimate the (posterior) parameters given the model structure and the data. The key advantages of this approach are that prior knowledge of the distributions of the transmission parameters can be incorporated, and that estimates of the uncertainty of the parameters are obtained directly from the model. It also makes full use of the observational data (Elderd et al. 2006). Disadvantages include computational complexity, choice of appropriate priors for each parameter and the more perplexing issue that varying the model structure and rerunning the process may yield equally compelling explanations of the data and equally uncertain parameter estimates (Babtie et al. 2014).",

For example, seasonal flu tends to be more virulent in young children and the elderly, whereas the 1918\u20131919 pandemic flu had noticeably higher mortality in the young adult population (Taubenberger and Morens 2006). The reason for this elevated mortality has been investigated in animal models in the lab. The conclusion of this study was that individuals who had been exposed to influenza once prior to 1918 were rendered vulnerable to experiencing a pathological immune response when infected with the 1918 H1N1 strain. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic had a different age mortality distribution again, with age-specific case fatality rates in teenagers and young adults significantly higher than in seasonal flu, whereas they were much lower in over 65s (Fig. 15.8). One possible explanation for this is that of residual immunity: those over-65s had some degree of immunity conferred from exposure to an H1N1 virus during childhood (Lemaitre and Carrat 2010). From these examples, it is clear that not just the age of the host is relevant: prior experience of previous strains will impact the virulence of future strains within the cohorts exposed to them. Sometimes these effects may reduce virulence, whereas in others, they may increase it.\n",

Using ABMs, it is possible to go a step further and include more detail about the strategy for vaccination and the likely uptake in different individuals. One current application of such modelling is a Dengue vaccine that has recently been licenced for use in six countries. The clinical trials of the vaccine demonstrated its ability to successfully confer immunity to those who had already been infected by Dengue; however, for people with no prior exposure to Dengue the vaccine increases risk of a more severe Dengue infection in future. Advanced modelling of the age groups vaccinated and the local transmission intensity suggests that vaccination of selected subgroups according to age and level of local transmission can have significantly superior outcomes versus traditional vaccination approaches (Ferguson et al. 2016).",

Antibiotics are an example of such an approach, where a patient suffering a bacterial infection may be treated with a high degree of efficacy (depending on the specific pathogen). Antibiotics can also be valuable in reducing mortality in pandemics where the pathogen is a virus. While the antibiotic does not directly have any impact on viral load, in historical pandemics such as 1918, very large numbers of deaths have been attributed to secondary bacterial infections, such as bacterial pneumonia (Morens et al. 2008). Modelling the effect of antibiotics over the course of such a pandemic can be done as follows: (i) assess antibiotic efficacy against secondary bacterial infections in the infected individual, yielding proportion of mortality reduced per secondary infection; (ii) multiply this by the proportion of secondary infections that occur; (iii) compare against the baseline of the primary infection case fatality rate. Reconstructions of the 1918 pandemic scenario assuming the ability to treat secondary bacterial infections have shown that use of antibiotics may have been able to reduce mortality by 60% (RMS 2012).",

Isolation is at its most useful when a disease becomes communicable after the onset of symptoms. One example of such a disease is Ebola virus, where effective isolation of suspected and known cases has been shown to reduce transmissibility significantly and can be incorporated into epidemic models (Shan et al. 2015). In examples such as influenza, however, such strategies do not work because onset of symptoms is some time after the infective period has begun. Non-pharmaceutical countermeasures used to reduce influenza spread are therefore focused on reducing contact rates and improving public practices around personal hygiene in the context of the pandemic. Evidence from some epidemiological and a number of modelling studies suggests that school closures may be an effective tool in reducing the peak load on hospitals and health infrastructure during a flu pandemic and may buy time to roll out the vaccine (Earn et al. 2012; Jackson et al. 2014).",

This provides a top-down view of the frequency of the outcome of myriad random processes. A frequency model based on the assumption that flu pandemics are independent events with a rate of between 3 and 4 per century has been used as a starting point for modelling (Bagus 2008; RMS 2012; AIR 2015). Beyond independence, this includes the tacit assumption that the behaviour of the world\u2019s population has not changed significantly over time and that the probabilities associated with the underlying processes leading up to a novel influenza strain.

This begins with understanding the evolutionary processes behind zoonosis. The process of genetic reassortment underpinning pandemic flu zoonosis may occur only when a single animal is infected with two strains of influenza. Therefore, data on the zoonotic reservoir of the disease can be useful in estimating future pandemic frequency. Influenza viruses circulate among animal, notably avian and swine populations. Where swine or poultry is kept in closely confined conditions and where viral strains that may be common in animal populations in other regions are introduced to a new region, the chance of reassortment is increased. Close human contact with animals, for example, sleeping in close proximity or frequent manual handling can increase the chance of a novel pathogen being transmitted to humans. We can, therefore, use proxies derived from these principles to gain insight on the probability of reassortment occurring and its transmission to humans. Extensive mapping projects are conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and are used in modelling frequency and location of origin of novel animal pathogens and zoonoses (Robinson et al. 2014).",

This is relevant to public health practitioners or task forces focussed on reducing the scale and impact of the outbreak, as well as to governments and organisations exposed to the impacts of the outbreak. For example, the range of possible control effects of using various countermeasures can be assessed by modelling their impact on the simulated pandemic, yielding a distribution of the net impact of the intervention.

Results of the field trial indicated that a ring vaccination strategy using the candidate vaccine could be highly effective at reducing transmission of the disease (Henao-Restrepo et al. 2015). This theory was tested further via computer simulation of ring vaccination strategies, which supported this finding in the latter stages of an epidemic, but with the caveat that the same strategy could be substantially less effective during the early stages of an outbreak (Kucharski et al. 2016).",

These instruments provide the sponsor a financial hedge against short-term (one- or two-year long) increases in mortality rates relative to the baseline mortality experienced in recent, normal times. Their purpose is to make a payout to life insurers and reinsurers in the event a qualifying excess mortality rate is achieved. The one to two calendar-year timeframe is particularly relevant for influenza pandemics, which are typically around that duration. These are parametric bonds, insofar as their payout structure is not based on an indemnity loss to the sponsor. Instead, it is based on national statistics agency-provided mortality data for the population of the covered countries.
