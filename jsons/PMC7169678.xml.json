The majority of retrospective reports related to transfusion ratios examined the ratio at 24 hours after admission. Subsequent reports suggested that it was not just the overall ratio that was important, but the early ratio, and that the survival benefit was achieved in the first 6 hours after injury.3, 4, 5 Although retrospective and observational data were promising, the lack of prospective data on transfusion ratios raised the question of whether the observed effects were the result of survival bias, rather than a true effect of the transfusion ratio.6 The issue of the potential need for early transfusion of plasma is of particular importance to the military, especially when one considers that movement of casualties to traditional hospital facilities may be significantly delayed due to distance, terrain, mission, or other factors.",

            "text": "Hemorrhage is the leading cause of potentially preventable deaths on the battlefield.7 Casualties with hemorrhagic shock often receive blood transfusions at forward positioned hospitals and surgical teams. The magnitude of this requirement is evidenced by the fact that more than 335,000 units of blood products had been transfused in Iraq and Afghanistan as of February 2015 (US Armed Services Blood Program Office). Of these, nearly 110,000 units were fresh\u2010frozen plasma (FFP). Delivering blood products where needed on the battlefield presents a significant logistic challenge for the military. FFP for military use is collected at US blood centers and shipped thousands of miles to the military point of use. This requires cold chain management over vast distances.2 The problem of bag breakage and loss of FFP during shipment has been significant, at times up to 40%. Before use, FFP must be thawed, a process that takes approximately 30 minutes. Once thawed, it must be refrigerated and used within 5 days. This presents challenges in inventory management and surge capacity when casualties requiring massive transfusion may arrive with little notice. Generally, FFP is only available where adequate freezers, refrigerators, thawing equipment, and electrical supply can be positioned and maintained. This limits availability in austere combat areas, at sea, and during aeromedical evacuation. While it is has been possible to move blood products closer to the patient during evacuation,8 the options are extremely limited where FFP is concerned, and battlefield plasma use remains limited by logistic constraints.",

Additionally, there are remote civilian hospitals and medical facilities around the world that are challenged by long prehospital transport times or limited by lack of laboratory facilities.

After additional improvements over the years, the current product excludes plasma from women positive for anti\u2010human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies and also incorporates pathogen reduction using an amotosalen and ultraviolet light process (Cerus Corporation, Concord, CA), a process that has been available in Europe and has recently been approved for plasma in the US. French lyophilized plasma (FLYP) has been used in military operations around the world and has also been authorized for civilian use in austere settings.14 In the early 1990s, a solvent/detergent (S/D) pathogen reduced pooled lyophilized plasma was developed by the German Red Cross. More than 300,000 units of the German S/D lyophilized plasma were used through 2006. Since 2007, the German Red Cross has produced LyoPlas N\u2010w, which is a single\u2010donor, quarantined lyophilized plasma.15 This product has also been used extensively and has an excellent safety record. The National Bioproducts Institute (Pinetown, South Africa) produces a pooled, S/D\u2010treated, ABO\u2010universal lyophilized plasma, Bioplasma FDP, which has been in use in South Africa since 1996, with a strong record of safety.16 Each of these products is currently available within each respective country and limited others.

From the perspective of meeting US Government emergency\u2010preparedness or military requirements, this approach would mean that the government would not be dependent on a single source for dried plasma and that military or other government blood centers could participate in production as a matter of routine. As an example, for military use, DoD blood banks in the United States could produce the dried plasma and ship it to field units utilizing existing logistic processes. For a civilian emergency, the product may be stockpiled and/or provided by surge production by regional blood centers. A technical challenge inherent with spray\u2010drying is the potential impact of the process on coagulation proteins.19 Therefore, process optimization will be very important. The program is currently in the preclinical stage, and there are active discussions with FDA to explore potential development pathways.",
