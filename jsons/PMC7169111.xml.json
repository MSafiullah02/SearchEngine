Eosinophilic airway inflammation is associated with more pronounced airway smooth muscle hypertrophy,15 and severe asthma in general is known to be associated with pronounced structural changes in the peripheral airways.16 Studies of fatal or near\u2010fatal asthma have indicated that increased inflammation during exacerbations aggravates this chronic state, causing pronounced mucus oedema, and lumen occlusion by mucus plugs, in a setting of predominantly eosinophilic infiltration.17, 18, 19 In light of this, even subtle changes in oxygenation could represent differences in the pathology involved and prove to be of prognostic value, but further studies are required to investigate this.",
