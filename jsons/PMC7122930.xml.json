Such a system therefore provides information for planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of public health programs. It includes case detection and registration, case confirmation, data reporting, data analysis, outbreak investigation, response and preparedness activities, feedback, and communication. Health authorities must also provide appropriate supervision, training, and resources for the surveillance system to operate properly.",

State and local public health officials use the information about occurrence of diseases to accurately monitor trends, plan and make decisions, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Established surveillance systems should be regularly reviewed based on the explicit criteria of usefulness, cost, and quality, and existing systems should be modified as a result of such reviews. Attributes of quality include: (1) sensitivity; (2) specificity; (3) representativeness; (4) timeliness; (5) simplicity; (6) flexibility; and (7) acceptability. The sensitivity of a surveillance system is its ability to detect health events (completeness of reporting). Its specificity is inversely proportional to the number of false-positive reports. Representativeness can be measured by comparing surveillance data covering part of the population to either nationwide data, where available, or to random samplesurvey data. Simplicity in a system means it is easy to understand and implement, and is usually expected to be relatively cheap and flexible. A flexible system can easily be adapted by adding new disease entities, conditions, and/or by extending surveillance to additional population groups. Acceptability depends on the perceived public health importance of the event under surveillance, recognition of individual contributions, and the time required for reports.",

The main responsibilities of NCDC include conducting surveillance on communicable and non- communicable diseases; controlling important diseases; carrying out preventive measurements; promoting healthy lifestyles; and gathering and processing medical statistical data. In addition, NCDC houses the Georgian National collection of especially dangerous pathogens. The NCDC network comprises 11 regional public health centers (CPH) and 66 district (rayon) CPH.

The healthcare system seemed nearly non-existent, and only international healthcare agencies were operating with the support of international organizations by conducting surveillance on communicable and non-communicable diseases. With the help of these agencies, NCDC succeeded in control and prevention of diseases important to the public health through health promotion programs, gathering and processing medical statistical data, running immunization programs, and so forth. During the 1990s, there were numerous achievements, like situation analysis and public health strategy design and piloting. Communicable disease surveillance guidelines for CPHs and healthcare providers, job aids for district-level CPHs and facility workers, etc., were established; human resource capacity was strengthened; district-level training and continuous supervision and support were carried out; and nationwide policy (endorsed by MoLHSA Decrees) was developed and implemented. Standard case definitions were determined for AFP/polio, measles, diphtheria, mumps, rubella/CRS, pertussis, tetanus, acute viral hepatitis, rabies, shigellosis, salmonellosis, cholera, bacterial meningitis, and influenza H5N1. Case definitions for anthrax, plague, tularemia, brucellosis, TBE, hemorrhagic fevers (HFRS, CCHF), and other diseases are forthcoming.",
