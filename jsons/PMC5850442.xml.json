In brief, adults (\u226518 years old) hospitalized with CAP were enrolled at 3 hospitals in Chicago, Illinois, and 2 hospitals in Nashville, Tennessee. Three hospitals were academic medical centers, 1 was a publicly funded county hospital, and 1 was a community hospital. All enrolled patients had clinical signs of CAP, including \u22651 sign of acute infection (fever, chills, hypothermia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, altered mental status) and \u22651 sign of acute respiratory illness (cough, sputum production, chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, abnormal lung examination, respiratory failure). Enrollment also required radiographic evidence of pneumonia as interpreted by a study-dedicated thoracic radiologist blinded to clinical data. Sera were collected from enrolled patients and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The study population for the current analysis included patients enrolled in the adult EPIC study with comprehensive pathogen testing (defined below) and sufficient banked sera to measure PCT (200 \u00b5L).",

We also assessed the association of PCT concentration on a continuous scale with the probability of bacterial CAP. PCT values were highly skewed; thus, we modeled PCT values with a restricted cubic spline function with 4 knots located at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles [32]. Using the predicted probabilities from a logistic regression model with spline-transformed PCT concentration as the independent variable and CAP pathogen group (bacterial vs comparator) as the dependent variable, we estimated the probability of bacterial CAP according to PCT concentration [32].",

Our study, which, to our knowledge, is the largest to date evaluating the association of PCT with pneumonia etiology, provides important data to complement these trials.

While these results demonstrate lower frequency of bacterial pathogens in patient populations with PCT below both the 0.1 ng/mL and 0.25 ng/mL thresholds, some individual patients with bacterial pathogens did present to the hospital with low PCT levels, highlighting that clinicians cannot rely on PCT alone to guide antibiotic treatment decisions.",

This was particularly true for Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila, but not Legionella. Routine coverage for atypical bacteria in empiric antibiotic CAP regimens is controversial because Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila infections are often self-limited with low mortality risk, and clinical trial data have failed to consistently demonstrate improvement in patient outcomes when atypical coverage is added to \u03b2-lactam monotherapy [31]. Proponents of empiric atypical coverage note that antibiotics improve outcomes for patients with Legionella pneumonia and may shorten the duration of symptoms for Mycoplasma pneumonia [30]. Because of this controversy, we analyzed our data with the atypical bacteria grouped with typical bacteria, and then with atypical bacteria grouped with viruses. Our results suggest that PCT is a better marker for typical bacteria than for the combined group of typical and atypical bacteria. Although the small sample size of patients with Legionella pneumonia (n = 21) prevented robust evaluation of PCT specifically in Legionella in this study, relatively high PCT in these patients suggests that the PCT response to Legionella pneumonia may be more similar to that of typical bacterial pneumonia than Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila pneumonia. If this is confirmed with future studies, elevated PCT indicating increased probability of a pathogen necessitating prompt antibiotics (typical bacteria or Legionella) and low PCT indicating increased probability of a pathogen not requiring prompt antibiotics (viruses, Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila) could be a useful paradigm.",

            "text": "A strength of our study was systematic, protocol-driven pathogen testing, which included both traditional culture-based and serology testing, as well as PCR-based techniques [7]. Despite this thorough testing, 62% of patients had no pathogen detected. This high proportion of patients with unknown etiology is similar to other contemporary CAP studies [14, 33], and presents a challenge for evaluating the accuracy of PCT for identifying bacterial pneumonia. Ideally, PCT would have been evaluated in a population of CAP patients who all had identified pathogens, enabling complete and precise classification of bacterial and nonbacterial disease. Unfortunately, identification of pathogens in all patients was not possible with currently available tests. Therefore, our approach included calculating PCT accuracy within both a microbiologically confirmed population (n = 645) of patients with identified bacterial and viral pathogens and the full population (n = 1735) including patients without any pathogens detected. Both of these populations have limitations. The microbiologically confirmed population is not directly generalizable into clinical practice because clinicians do not know which patients will test positive for pathogens when making initial decisions about antibiotics. Meanwhile, the full population likely included some patients who were misclassified into the nonbacterial group due to failure of pathogen testing to detect some of the relevant bacteria. Together, these complementary analyses provide an estimated range for the accuracy of PCT to identify bacterial CAP. It will be important to reassess PCT accuracy as pathogen testing for CAP improves and more patients can be classified into bacterial and viral groups [10].",

First, 23% of patients enrolled in the EPIC study were not included in this analysis because serum specimens for PCT measurement were not available; this had the potential to introduce a selection bias, but measured clinical characteristics and detected pathogens were similar between the included and excluded patients. Second, while some protocols recommend serial PCT measurements to guide antibiotic prescribing [34], we only measured PCT at the time of hospital admission. Third, invasive diagnostic testing (eg, thoracentesis, bronchoscopy) was only utilized when deemed medically necessary by the treating physicians; study-dictated invasive tests may have resulted in more patients with an identified pathogen. Fourth, all detected pathogens may not have represented causative agents for pneumonia; for example, viruses detected in NP/OP swabs may have represented infection limited to the upper airways or asymptomatic shedding [35]. Fifth, we sampled patients for pathogens at the time of hospital admission only; delayed bacterial pneumonias that developed after an initial viral infection would not have been detected with this sampling method. Finally, all enrolled patients were hospitalized and we are unable to comment on PCT in outpatients with pneumonia.",
