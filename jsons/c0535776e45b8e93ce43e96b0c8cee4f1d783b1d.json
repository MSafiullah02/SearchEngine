Hall et al [1] estimated an annual average of 520 RSV-associated hospitalizations per 100 000 children aged <2 years between 2000 and 2005. Moreover, Iwane et al [22] reported 1850 and 740 RSV-associated hospitalizations per 100 000 children aged 0-5 months and 6-11 months, respectively, for 1 season. Similar to FluSurv-NET, RSV was identified by molecular assays; however, NVSN systematically tests those who meet the ARI case definition, whereas FluSurv-NET collects data on patients with an RSV-confirmed diagnosis who were tested at the discretion of clinicians, hence, the need for case ascertainment adjustments. Other studies that used different estimation methods presented similar findings [8, 9, [23] [24] [25] [26] . Nonetheless, compared with our study, Homaira et al [25] , in New South Wales, Australia, used administrative datasets that followed 870 314 children aged <5 years from 2001 to 2010 and reported higher annual incidence rates for RSV hospitalizations among healthy children aged 0-3, 4-6, 7-11, and 12-24 months to be 2560, 1670, 470, and 280 per 100 000, respectively [25] . Similarly, a prospective severe respiratory illness surveillance study in 3 hospitals in 2 South African provinces reported an incidence of RSV-associated hospitalizations of 6593, 3411, 1494, and 409 per 100 000 for children aged 0-2, 3-5, 6-11, and 12-23 months, respectively [27] . Hospitalization rates from these 2 studies were higher compared with our estimate. In Australia they did not have laboratory-confirmed cases and relied on administrative codes for acute lower respiratory tract infections and RSV, which could partly explain the higher rates. There could also be differences due to the underlying characteristics of the study populations, including a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus in South Africa [28] . Notably, for all of these approaches and in all settings, the highest rates were in the youngest age group, which is an important consideration for targeting interventions. Estimates of RSV-associated hospitalization rates for children aged <12 months are higher than estimates of influenzaassociated hospitalization rates for children aged <12 months using the same methodology. Rates of hospitalization per 100 000 children for RSV and influenza were 1970 vs 328 for children 0-2 months, 897 vs 117 for 3-5 months, and 531 vs 101 for 6-11 months [29] . A limitation to this comparison is that the above-mentioned influenza data are from 2003 to 2012, whereas the RSV data are from the 2014-15 season. Despite this limitation, a number of other studies have found RSV to have a higher incidence among children aged <5 years compared with influenza [4, 8, 24, 26, 29, 30] . Our findings reaffirm that among young children in the United States, RSV represents a major cause of respiratory disease-associated hospitalizations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 742, "end": 745, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 763, "end": 766, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 914, "end": 918, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1456, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1459, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1464, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1469, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1474, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1475, "end": 1479, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1538, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1854, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2135, "end": 2139, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2589, "end": 2593, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3144, "end": 3148, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3445, "end": 3448, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3449, "end": 3451, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3452, "end": 3455, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3456, "end": 3459, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3460, "end": 3463, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3464, "end": 3467, "text": "30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 297, "end": 306, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Estimating RSV Disease Burden"}, {"text": "The RSV clinical course described in our study follows trends that are similar to those presented in other studies, but site-specific variation in severity was observed [3, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Severity indicators such as respiratory distress (59% in Georgia to 85% in Oregon) and wheezing (19% in Georgia to 44% in Oregon) varied by site, which could indicate different criteria for admission or different underlying characteristics of the populations at each study site. We observed that ICU admission varied substantially among our 4 study sites (from 13% to 45%), which could be explained by different thresholds for admission and different testing practices among participating FluSurv-NET hospitals [36] . Overall, 90% of the ICU-admitted children were tested for RSV compared with 75% among those not admitted to the ICU. Testing rates among ICU-admitted children and non-ICU-admitted children were similar among the very young age group, but differences up to approximately 20% can be seen among older age groups (Supplementary Table  9 ). When we looked at variation of testing by site and ICU admission, Georgia and Oregon were 40% more likely to test children in the ICU than those not in the ICU. Other factors, including gestational age at delivery, age at hospital admission, and type of insurance, may also influence ICU admission practices [33] . Most importantly, Georgia had the highest rate of ICU admissions and children requiring mechanical ventilation (9% compared with a low of 2% in California), and 4 of the 5 identified deaths occurred in Georgia. Overall, the proportion of ICU admissions in our study was higher than described in the US study by Rodriguez-Fernandez et al (10% vs 27% reported in our study), which was based on 2 pediatric hospitals [34] , but with a substantially smaller sample size (253 children aged <2 years compared with our sample of more than 1500 children) that may explain the variation. Similar to other studies [3, 32] , mechanical ventilation was used in <10% of the cases. Furthermore, 67% of all hospitalized cases had no clear risk factor for severe disease, consistent with a previous report [35] and highlighting the importance of developing new interventions that can be broadly applied to infants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 172, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 173, "end": 177, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 178, "end": 182, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 183, "end": 187, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 188, "end": 192, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 193, "end": 197, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 711, "end": 715, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1366, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1783, "end": 1787, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1976, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 1980, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2163, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1042, "end": 1050, "text": "Table  9", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Estimating RSV Disease Burden"}, {"text": "This study highlights the opportunity to adapt an existing platform for influenza hospitalization surveillance in order to monitor RSV in the United States. In 2014-2015, the RSV and influenza seasons largely overlapped (the RSV season nationally ranged from 11 October 2014 to 9 May 2015, peaking on 7 February 2015) [5] . However, this is not the case every year and would need to be taken into account to avoid substantial underestimation of RSV-associated burden. We applied a previously described method to adjust for inherent factors of the surveillance system such as under-ascertainment of cases due to variability in testing practices and diagnostic test sensitivity [12, 15, 16] . Although RSV testing overall was high among children aged <2 years with respiratory symptoms, we observed a substantial decrease in testing among children aged \u22656 months, necessitating the adjustment. The study included several limitations. First, due to limited funding, the study was limited to 4 of the 13 states that currently participating in FluSurv-NET [13] . Nonetheless, the 4 sites together provided a diverse population, and their catchment population reflected 4% of the US population aged <2 years. However, results may not be generalizable to the entire US population. Including additional hospitals in the future would allow for more robust assessments, lessening the impact of variability in clinical practices among healthcare settings. Second, surveillance was limited to 1 season. Several years of surveillance are needed for robust burden estimates because there can be variations in RSV circulation and severity from year to year [11] . Third, we only obtained data on RSV testing practices from December 2014 to April 2015 and did not include October 2014 and November 2014. While this may have underestimated our rate calculation, the observed variability for the underdetection multipliers by month is small, particularly among children aged 0-2 months (Supplementary Table 8 ). Fourth, we used 90% sensitivity for viral culture based on a previous reference [19] . Weinberg et al [37] found low sensitivity for RSV diagnosis by culture (36%) when compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [37] . However, for the analytic part of this study, culture represented only approximately 6% of those tested. Finally, we based the correction of case ascertainment on ICD-9 codes that were preselected based on the most common codes identified through surveillance among RSV cases from other studies [1] . As such, we may have inadvertently missed RSV cases who did not meet the preselected criteria, which could have led to a slight underestimation of hospitalization rates. On the other hand, since several of the preselected ICD-9 codes are not specific for RSV, we may have included hospitalizations associated with other respiratory viruses that cocirculated during this time [38] .
