Following this registration process, patients receive a QR code to their mobile device to be scanned at the facility on the day of testing. Those who lack access to a car or are unable to travel receive a home visit, where they are tested by MDA staff.",

However, to comply with health policies, students were trained in small groups of less than 10, which created time lags and constraints on the quality of the training they received. In more detail, PPE protocol reviews were limited to demonstrations only, leaving many students to don PPE for their first time on-site. A further layer of confusion arose from the fact that \"drive and test\" facilities and home visits used different PPE equipment and protocols.",

This problem was compounded by the fact that the team relied on a single WhatsApp group, of over 250 participants, to disseminate all information related to volunteering.

In the first week, a driver stopped their car during testing using only the brake pedal with their car still in gear. Startled during the swabbing process, the driver jerked pressing the accelerator instead and caused an accident. After the incident, volunteers were given a script that, among other things, instructed drivers to put their vehicle in park and engage their parking brake.",

Subsequently, new volunteers were paired with experienced ones for at least 1 full shift. This was a feasible solution, considering each station already required 2 volunteers: 1 to prepare and log the sample and the other to take the sample from the patient.
