The goal of health care during disasters shifts to maintaining adequate care for the greatest number of patients [5], [6]. A major incident (MI) is similar to that of a disaster, with the main difference being that quality care for everyone is maintained through adequate redistribution and allocation of resources [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Emergency departments are vital components in mitigating the effects of disasters or major incidents. Disasters/MIs often result in mass causalities at the incident site, with many victims requiring pre-hospital assessment and care. However, a large number of patients, often described as self-presenters, arrive at the emergency department (ED) without pre-hospital assessment [12]. When a MI occurs, ED departments may be required to quickly increase their operational capacity to receive, prioritize and treat the rapid flow of patients. This ability to increase the capacity of the ED to manage the sudden influx of patients is a hospital\u2019s surge capacity [13], [14]. With escalating waiting times and crowding at EDs [15] affecting surge capacity negatively, front line health care workers\u2019 skills, knowledge and abilities are essential.",
