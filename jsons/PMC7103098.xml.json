The Lombard Regional Council called an emergency task force in order to reprogram the regional system. The Lombardy region accounts for 26 neurosurgical departments in 21 hospitals with more than 200 neurosurgeons and 40 residents in training. During the early days of the first outbreak, each neurosurgical department responded individually, and according to the number of COVID-19 positive patients present in the hospital, elective surgical activities, hospitalizations, and non-urgent outpatient visits were gradually reduced. Since March 8th 2020, the regional medical system, including neurosurgical activities, has been completely reorganized by the decision of the Lombard Regional Government (decree n\u00b0 XI/2906).",
