Third, among patients who had influenza URD only at presentation (N = 71), the presence of influenza RNA at URD presentation was evaluated and analyzed as a time-dependent risk factor for progression to LRD.

The relatively small sample size prevented us from performing models that included all possible risk factors simultaneously, but we formed several different bivariate models that adjusted for other important factors (eg, early initiation of antiviral therapy [<48 hours]). All models showed viremia as a very significant factor for clinically important outcomes (Table 2). We analyzed preemptive antiviral therapy as a possible factor for outcome based on previous studies. Antiviral therapy consisted largely of oseltamivir, but some earlier cases of influenza A were treated with M2-inhibitors. Finally, we used plasma or serum samples for quantitative RT-PCR, but could not test or culture any cellular components due to the retrospective nature of our study. The optimal blood component for influenza RNA detection has not been defined [12]. Although the serum and plasma samples in our study were not collected specifically for future RNA detection, the influenza RNA detection rate did not decline in older samples and samples were evenly spread throughout the study period. Nevertheless, we recognize the possibility that using serum and plasma stored for as many as 20 years may have underestimated the true rate of influenza RNA or may introduce bias [15].",

Viremia also appeared to be associated with mortality among patients with influenza LRD. Thus influenza RNA detection in blood may serve as marker for poor overall outcome in immunosuppressed patients. Future studies should confirm these findings in larger cohorts, focus on defining the optimal blood fraction that contains the highest amount of virus, and investigate the usefulness of viral RNA detection in blood as a marker for progressive disease in other settings of influenza disease.",
