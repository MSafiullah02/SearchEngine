When all four expression vectors were co-transfected VLP formed, as confirmed using electron microscopy. Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the N protein, N-protein-containing particles similar in size to the VLP were also observed by immunoelectron microscopy, indicating that the VLP contained the N protein. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated an interaction between the N and M proteins, suggesting that N protein binds directly to M protein to be incorporated into VLP.",

The density of this fraction (1.157 g/cm 3 ) was similar to that reported previously for VLP-containing fractions (14, 19, 10) , indicating that the N and S proteins in fraction 6 were secreted as SARS-CoV VLP. The N protein, but not the S protein, was also detected in fractions 3 and 4 (density, 1.08-1.10 g/cm 3 ; Fig. 2 ).

            "text": "Coronavirus packaging of genomic RNA is dependent on a nucleotide sequence known as the PS (27, 28) . Although packaging of MHV genomic RNA can occur independently of the MHV N protein (29) , the MHV N protein does bind to a specific PS sequence located at the end of the 1b gene of the MHV RNA genome to facilitate its packaging into virus particles (24, 30, 31) . Recently, the putative SARS-CoV PS was identified and localized in the genomic region spanning nucleotides 19715-20294, and N-protein expression was demonstrated to be required for packaging of the SARS-CoV genome into VLP (14, 32) . To validate these earlier reports using our VLP system, we constructed fusion RNA for use in a packaging experiment. This RNA, denoted as GFP-PS RNA (Fig. 4a) contains the SARS-CoV genomic region 18486-21485, which encompasses the putative PS (14) . The EGFP gene was transcribed in vitro for use as negative-control RNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection with plasmids expressing the SARS-CoV structural proteins, cells were transfected with the in vitro-transcribed RNA (2 \u03bcg/well) using a TransIT mRNA transfection kit (Mirus, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To elucidate which structural proteins were critical for the release of VLP containing GFP-PS RNA, RT-PCR was carried out using the culture medium from cells that expressed various combinations of the structural proteins (Fig. 4b) . Before extraction of total RNA, the PEG-precipitated culture medium was resuspended in PBS supplemented with RNase A (20 \u03bcg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to degrade free RNA.",

(a) Immunoprecipitation analysis. Transfected cells were lysed using lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphatebuffered saline), and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-N-protein pAb (20 \u03bcg/ml; upper two panels) or with anti-HA-tag mAb (lower two panels). The expression plasmids used for transfection are indicated at the bottom of the figure. The viral proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-N-protein mAb (Clone 122) to detect N protein or anti-HA-tag mAb to detect M protein, as indicated to the left of thefigure. (b) N-ELISA results.The ratio of the extracellular amount of N protein (N-ELISA extracellular OD value) to the total amount of N protein (sum of N-ELISA extra-and intracellular OD values) was calculated for 293T cells that were transfected with the expression plasmids indicated on the x-axis. The results are expressed relative to those from cells that expressed the N protein alone (1). (c) S-ELISA results.",
