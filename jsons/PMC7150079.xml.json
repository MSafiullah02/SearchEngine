The genus Bartonella has undergone major reorganization as molecular techniques have defined genetic relationships between known species and improved the detection of new species. The previously separate genera Rochalimaea and Grahamella were merged into Bartonella in the early 1990s.2, 3 Approximately 20 species of Bartonella are recognized currently; however, new species have been defined as recently as 2002, and further changes in the classification of Bartonella undoubtedly will occur in the coming years.2, 4\n",

B. henselae is classified further into two genotypes, B. henselae I and B. henselae II, previously known as B. henselae Houston I strain and B. henselae Marseilles strain, respectively.5 These genotypes are differentiated by the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences.5 Differences in other proteins also have been demonstrated, and these are likely responsible for the variation in antibody responses in infected cats.5, 6 Coinfection with both genotypes of B. henselae can occur in cats, as can coinfection with either B. henselae genotype and B. clarridgeiae.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n",

Although B. henselae is adapted for infection of cats, its larger genome and numerous potential vectors indicate it is less specialized than other members of the genus.13, 14 In addition to the domestic cat, wild felids also can be infected, but the clinical implications in these species are still unknown.15, 16\n",

Once the decision has been made to test for Bartonella spp., antibody testing can be an appropriate initial screen. Paired titers may be considered in acutely ill cats; single resting titers are sufficient in patients with chronic illnesses. Negative titers can be considered adequate for excluding bartonellosis in chronically ill cats, whereas positive titers can be followed by blood culture, PCR, or antibiotic trials as appropriate. Culture of blood is recommended in all cases of endocarditis because this disease is always presumed to be secondary to bacteremia. Serial antibody titers likely are not useful for monitoring response to treatment, although some laboratories do claim to see a decrease in titer after antibiotic therapy. Repeat culture or PCR can be performed if desired, but because of the relapsing nature of Bartonella spp. bacteremia, negative results may be transient.",
