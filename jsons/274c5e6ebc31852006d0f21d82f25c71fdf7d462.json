Four common human coronaviruses that cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses, including 229E (alpha coronavirus), NL63 (alpha coronavirus), OC43 (beta coronavirus), and HKU1 (beta coronavirus), were first recorded in the 1960 s. Two other human coronaviruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which lead to severe lung infections known as severe acute respiratory syndrome -SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome -MERS, respectively [1, 2] . The SARS-CoV outbreak occurred in 2002, starting in China and spreading to other countries, with a death rate of 11%. The MERS-CoV outbreak occurred in 2012, starting in Saudi Arabia and spreading to other countries, with a death rate of 37%. Now, we are seeing the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, which can affect both upper respiratory and lower respiratory tracts and causes unusual viral pneumonia, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) or novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP). All of the three coronaviruses that have caused human pandemics are of beta coronaviruses.",

The two main varieties of innate immune receptors, transmembrane and cytosolic, are critical to establishing the innate immune responses, thereby leading to adaptive immune responses. Transmembrane receptors, mainly toll-like receptors (TLRs), can sense both live and dead viruses. The capacity of cytosolic innate immune receptors, including RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), Nod-like receptors (NLRs), and AIM2-like receptors (ALRs), is limited, as they can only sense live viruses [3] . Consistently, among different innate immune receptors, TLRs are most closely related to adaptive immune responses. TLRs are, therefore, an important element of anti-viral immunity. They can detect both the complete (infectious) viral particles, including viral nucleic acid and viral envelop proteins, and defective viral particles [4] . Upon recognition of a virus, TLR signaling upregulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules, through the accumulation of interferons (IFNs) [5] . Consequently, adaptive antimicrobial immunity is processed by costimulatory molecules.",

Macroparasites are bigger and can have multiple hosts. The 2019-nCoV involves cytokines and chemokines from the initiation to the elongation phases of the disease [7] . In its initiation stage, the 2019-nCoV would increase plasma concentrations of different cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-1R\u03b1, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, basic FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN\u03b3, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNF-\u03b1, and vascular endothelial growth factor [7] . Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) showed higher levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 compared with those who did not need to be in an ICU [7] . The work of 2019-nCoV seems to be an interplay between different T-helper (Th) cell population subsets, e.g., Th1, Th2, and Treg. There are instances, in both microparasites and macroparasites, which have been correlated with such this orchestration of immune responses. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a prototype of microparasites linked to all three Th1, Th2, and Treg cell expansion [8] .",

Additionally, December, when 2019-nCoV first recognized, is the first month of winter. Both with time and place, the outbreak of SARS-CoV occurred in precisely the same condition (during the winter season and in low humidity). We can, therefore, understand the relation between the origin of the 2019-nCoV and the changing condition of climate. Both winter and low humidity act as a stressor for the immune system. Evidence indicates the association of cold temperature and low humidity with respiratory tract infections in the manner that the lower the environmental temperature/humidity, the more and the sooner respiratory tract infections occur in a population [18] . Early interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) induction in viral infections indicates a battle between the innate immunity and the virus. In colder temperature, IFN-\u03b3 production by the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) that are essential for the recognition of viral RNA by the innate immunity decreases in airway cells, so well adapted for viral replication [19] . Then, the immune system would commence fever, to allow the expression of the TLR4, and trigger from this a series of anti-viral immune responses characterized by the production of cytokines [20] . With nearly 99% reporting, the most common symptom of 2019-nCoV infection at onset is fever.",

The viral genome and its structural proteins have a direct tendency to impair immune surveillance. As the analysis of protein sequences has shown, eight HLA-DR epitopes that are located in the Spike, Envelope, and Membrane of the 2019-nCoV play an essential part in the obstruction of the immune surveillance [29] . Also, there are B-cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes that are uniquely present on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV [36] . These epitopes are likely a vaccine target for the 2019-nCoV. Superinfection with an apathogenic dsRNA virus strengthens the upregulation of IFNs, which are the key player of anti-viral immunity [37] . It could be shown that this method, called the superinfection therapeutic (SIT) strategy, promotes the resolution of viral infections, both DNA and RNA viruses [38] . However, this does not determine whether it would confer a benefit in the case of 2019-nCoV as well. Another era in the treatment of infection with 2019-nCoV can be devoted to the clinical development of T-cell products.",
