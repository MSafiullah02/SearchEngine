At a high level aviation security conference held by the International Civil Aviation Organization in September 2012, ICAO advised that civil aviation was estimated to grow by 6 % in 2013; 6.4 % in 2014; and 4.9 % on an annual basis until 2020, such growth being encouraging to the air transport industry from an economic perspective. At the same time, ICAO cautioned that this growth may not necessarily halt the persisting threat of unlawful interference with civil aviation and that the threat will evolve into a complex web of activity as new innovative methods of attack are conceived. This brought to bear the compelling need to address the growing vulnerabilities of the air transport system and the sustainability of aviation security.",

One principle was that a strong, sustainable and resilient air cargo security system is essential and that the threat is to the air cargo system as a whole and risk-based consideration must be given to strengthening security measures across all aspects of the system, including enhancing the ability to recover from a major disruption. Another was that appropriate security controls should be implemented at the point of origin. Cargo and mail should come from a secure supply chain or be screened and, in either case, protected throughout the entire journey, including at transfer and transit points. At points of transfer, States should satisfy themselves that security controls previously applied to cargo and mail meet ICAO Standards. In doing so, they should avoid unnecessary duplication of security controls.",

It is worth noting a number of important inter-related policy principles and practices that can contribute to the achievement of sustainable aviation security. These and other means can, more broadly, support the development of a sound and economically-viable civil aviation system. The starting point for consideration of any security measure must be a risk assessment. Such risk assessments, carried out objectively by appropriate security authorities on a continuous basis and informed by available and relevant information, including security intelligence, help assure that new or revised security measures are justified, aligned with actual needs and are proportionate to the level of risk.",

When one compares this statistic to other modes of transport, such as trains and buses, one notes that there have been approximately 2,000 attacks and about 4,000 deaths resulting. On this basis, aviation has been fortunate. However, one cannot be complacent. The terrorist anchors himself on the Displacement Theory, moving from one mode of attack to another when the going gets bad. The 9/11 attacks on buildings turned to attacks on airports and then onwards to cargo. Examples go back to the 1980s where, in the early 1980s, aircraft were attacked through the cargo hold (recalling just three instances when aircraft of Air India and PANAM were blown up in midair as well as the attack on the Airlanka aircraft) to using aircraft as weapons of mass destruction in 2001, to attacking airports in the 1990s. Recalling the events of 29 October 2011 discussed above, one could argue that unlawful interference with civil aviation has turned full 360 degrees and has seemingly returned to attacks on cargo.",

The Statement focused the attention of ICAO member States to Standard 3.1.3 of Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) which requires each State to keep under constant review the level of threat to civil aviation within its territory, and establish and implement policies and procedures to adjust relevant elements of its national civil aviation security programme, based on a security risk assessment carried out by relevant national authorities. The Conference, based on this fundamental premise, recognized that a reasonably designed risk-based approach is one by which States identify the criteria to measure potential criminal activities, principally from terrorism.

This Strategy would be guided by the ICAO security audit results, where air cargo and mail security has been identified as a priority need. The Strategy would include a proposal to coordinate bilateral and multilateral capacity building initiatives regionally, as well as amongst international organizations such as the World Customs Organization (WCO) and the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in order to align such initiatives, maximize limited resources, and avoid duplication of efforts.

Security should not accumulate layer upon layer of controls and associated costs, but should rather ensure the sustainability of the system from the perspectives of cost, efficiency, and acceptability by passengers and air transport operators, which should be a central consideration when designing security processes. Another means of achieving sustainability is at transfer points where security controls are known to have been performed effectively at the point of origin. The Conference took note of the fact that, in such instances, the concept of \"One Stop Security\" should be advanced, where ICAO Member States, by virtue of recognising the equivalence of each other's aviation security regimes, can allow incoming passengers, baggage and cargo to transfer onto a connecting flight without being subjected, once again, to the same security controls as at the point of origin.

A security culture would make States aware of their rights and duties, and, more importantly, enable States to assert them. Those who belong to a security culture also know which conduct would compromise security and they are quick to educate and caution those who, out of ignorance, forgetfulness, or personal weakness, partake in insecure conduct. This security consciousness becomes a \"culture\" when all the 191 member States of ICAO as a whole make security violations socially and morally unacceptable within the group. In building a security culture within ICAO member States it is imperative that consideration should also be given to the development of a process for ensuring that all Member States are notified when deficiencies identified during the course of an ICAO security audit conducted under the Universal Security Audit Programme (USAP) remain unaddressed for a sustained period of time. A notification process could involve the use of information which does not divulge specific vulnerabilities but enables States to initiate consultations with the State of interest to ensure the continued protection of aviation assets on a bilateral basis. States have to adopt a security culture that admits of an overall approach to the threat as a potential harm to humanity. This should inevitably include strict adherence by States to the provisions of Annex 17.",

Accordingly, and with a view to addressing the case where a Community citizen expired in a Community country other than his own and his remains had to be repatriated to his country, a Committee was appointed by the European Parliament to consider an instrument that addressed the conveyance of mortal remains suggested in 2003 Resolution 2003 /2032 . This Resolution noted that, on account of the above agreements, the death of a Community citizen in a Member State other than his country of origin results in more complex procedures, a longer period of time before burial or cremation takes place and higher costs than if the death had occurred in the deceased person's country of origin, Another compelling reason for this Resolution was the recognition that, in view of the growth in intra-Community tourism, the increasing numbers of retired people who choose to live in a country other than their own and, more generally, greater intra-Community mobility which is actually encouraged, the number of Community citizens who die in a country other than their country of origin was bound to increase. This was considered against the backdrop that Community citizens should, mutatis mutandis, be able to move between and reside in Member States in similar conditions to nationals of a Member State moving around or changing their place of residence in their own country, and that exercising the right to freedom of movement and freedom of residence should be facilitated to the utmost by reducing administrative formalities to an absolute minimum.",

IATA further suggested that acceptance of such coffins is dependent upon the type of aircraft, requirements of entry and clearance and prior approval of the countries of origin, transit and destination. 11 The Council noted that comments on the carriage of coffins had been received from twenty seven States (from a total of 72 member States at that time) and two overseas territories. Three of these States reported that they were bound by the provisions of the 1937 Berlin Agreement and Eight States advised ICAO that the carriage of corpses existed in their national legislations.

The ICAO guidance goes on to say that legislation often requires a post mortem examination of those killed in an accident and in some instances there may be remains that cannot be identified. 15 ICAO also calls for personal effects of the deceased to be correctly handled and returned to their lawful owners. 16 The Guidance also calls for the State of occurrence to provide for the return of human remains 17 while also devolving that burden-of the carriage of such remains-upon the aircraft operator involved in the accident. 18",

The Annex 9 definition of cargo implies that human remains could be categorized as cargo by giving the definition of cargo as \"any property carried on an aircraft other than mail, stores and accompanied or mishandled baggage. This definition is slightly different from the one contained in another ICAO document-Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air 19 which defines \"cargo\" as \"any property carried on an aircraft other than mail and accompanied or mishandled baggage. Annex 18 does not define the word \"cargo\" but defines \"dangerous goods\" as articles or substances which are capable of posing a risk to health, safety, property or the environment and which are shown in the list of dangerous goods in the Technical Instructions or which are classified according to those instructions. The Technical Instructions do not list human remains as being dangerous cargo. However, it behooves the international aviation community to inquire, along the lines of ICAO discussions in the Council, whether human remains could be ruled out as not posing a risk to health or the environment under any circumstances of carriage by air or whether human remains, depending on the way it is packed for transport, could be considered as dangerous goods. 20 Standard 4.6.1 of Annex 17 requires each Contracting State to ensure that appropriate security controls, including screening where applicable, are applied to cargo and mail, prior to their being loaded onto an aircraft engaged in passenger commercial air transport operations. The operative words here are \"security 15 Id. Paragraph 3.10. 16 Id. Paragraph 3.11. 17 Id. Paragraph 5.1. 18 Id.

A regulated agent is defined in the Annex as an agent, freight forwarder or any other entity who conducts business with an operator and provides security controls that are accepted or required by the appropriate authority in respect of cargo or mail. There are five other provisions under Chapter 4.6 of Annex 17 pertaining to: the protection of cargo and mail from unauthorized interference from the point of screening or other security controls being applied until the departure of the aircraft 22 ; the non-acceptance of cargo or mail by operators unless it is confirmed that screening or other procedures have been applied and conformed by a regular agent 23 ; the appropriate screening of catering, stores and supplies intended for carriage by air 24 ; the appropriate screening of merchandise and supplies introduced into security restricted areas 25 ; and the fact that the security controls mentioned above have been implemented on the basis of a security risk assessment carried out by relevant national authorities. 26 Getting back to Annex 9, there is a whole chapter in the Annex-Chapter 4dedicated to the entry and departure of cargo and other articles. Surprisingly, there is no provision in the Annex for priority of clearance or transport of human remains over other cargo, despite the prominence given to the subject in ICAO Circular 285-AN/166. 27 Another surprise is that, although there is a Recommended Practice in the Annex which suggests that electronic information systems for the release and clearance of \"goods\" (my emphasis) should cover their transfer between air and other modes of transport, 28 there is no definition of \"goods\" in the Annex. Do corpses or cremated human remains come under the purview of \"goods\"? This question is valid in the context of Appendix 3 to the Annex which has a template for a cargo manifest where there exists a column for \"Nature of Goods\". There is no mention of the word \"cargo\" in this template. 21 Annex 17 defines a security control as \"a means by which the introduction of weapons, explosives or other dangerous devices, articles or substances which may be used to commit acts of unlawful interference can be prevented. 22 Standard 4.6.3. 23 Standard 4.6.4. 24 Standard 4.6.5. 25 Standard 4.6.6. 26 Standard 4.6.7. 27 Baldwin (1910) , 97. 28 Annex 9 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, Thirteenth Edition: July 2011, Recommended Practice 4.18.",

The IGOM requires the carrier to make sure that a Human Remains Acceptance Checklist has been used (if required by the operating airline). Carriers are required, according to the IGOM, not to accept any human remains that are consolidated with any cargo other than other human remains. With regard to cremated human remains the Manual requires that only urns or other suitable containers as cargo with no special restrictions are accepted for carriage and that the carrier should make sure that the urn or other container is packed in a neutral outer pack that will protect the urn from breakage and/spillage. 30 It also prescribes that human remains in coffins should not be stored next to food or live animals, adding that there appears to be no scientific or technical reason why live animals and human remains should be segregated in aircraft cargo compartments, except that it may be ethical for cultural reasons to segregate them.",

This Standard should be adopted in accordance with the basic philosophy of Article 44 (d) of the Chicago Convention which states that ICAO should strive to meet the needs of the people of the world for safe, regular, efficient and economical air transport.",

In the ultimate analysis, there has to be core global rules in place for this important area of air transportation. It cannot be left for individual States or airlines to decide.",
