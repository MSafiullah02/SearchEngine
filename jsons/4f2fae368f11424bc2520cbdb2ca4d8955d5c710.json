Methods: This prospective study enrolled children aged 2-59 months admitted to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined clinical pneumonia. Demographic and clinico-radiological data were collected through questionnaires, physical examination, and chest radiography. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal washing were collected for microbiological analysis including culture and molecular methods. Results: From July 2017 to June 2018, 189 children were enrolled, of which 53.4% were infants. Pneumoniarelated admissions were less frequent over the winter. Chest radiographies were obtained in 149 children; endpoints included pneumonia in 39 cases (26.2%), other infiltrates in 31 (20.8%), and were normal in 79 children (53.0%). Non-contaminated bacterial growth was detected in 8/152 (5.3%) blood cultures, with only two cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral detection in upper respiratory secretions was common, with at least one virus detected in 103/115 (89.6%). The three most-commonly isolated viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (52/115; 45.2%), rhinovirus (42/115; 36.5%), and human parainfluenza virus (19/115; 16.5%). A third of patients with viral infections showed mixed infections. Case fatality rate was 3.2% (6/189). Conclusion: Respiratory viral infections predominated among this cohort of WHO-defined clinical pneumonia cases, whereas bacterial aetiologies were uncommon, highlighting the epidemiologic transition that Bhutan seems to have reached.",

Most of these lives could be saved through more effective and equitable health system interventions, combining prevention, early and accurate diagnosis, and treatment (Walker et al., 2013; Rambaud-Althaus et al., 2015) .

Pneumonia deaths are decreasing, but more slowly than for other major causes of mortality, and too slowly to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal ambition of \"ending preventable child deaths\" by 2030 (United Nations, 2018) .",

All the nurses in the PICU and paediatric ward were trained at the beginning of the study by the lead investigator on how to collect these samples. When a child was identified for recruitment but blood had already been collected, no further blood sampling was conducted. However, if another blood analysis was clinically indicated, additional blood was obtained for the specific purpose of the study. Fluid from pleural effusion was collected when clinically indicated. All recruited patients underwent a postero-anterior chest radiography upon admission. Additional information of potential diagnostic interest, such as computed tomography scans, ultrasound, or cerebrospinal fluid investigation available throughout admission, was also collected. Children were clinically managed and discharged as per existing hospital protocols and discretion of the treating paediatricians, and were followed-up by one study investigator in terms of outcome determination.

However, this finding is consistent with those reported by the national sentinel surveillance programme for severe acute respiratory infections, and with the proportion of all-cause paediatric admissions, lower during winter (Royal Centre for Disease Control, 2018). This could be partially explained by the fact that winter coincides with the school break in Bhutan, with less contact among children; and families moving from the capital to the villages with lower population density. Hypoxemia is a well-established predictor of severity in children with pneumonia (Duke et al., 2001; Lozano, 2001) . A high proportion of children in this study (74.9%) presented with hypoxemia, which is much higher than reported in other settings (Subhi et al., 2009; O'Brien et al., 2019) . We defined hypoxemia as SpO2 < 90%, which is considered appropriate for altitudes under 2500 m, as is the case with Thimphu (2334 m). This characteristic might therefore not be generalizable to Bhutanese children who live at different altitudes than that of Thimphu.",

First, vaccination coverage was high, which is representative of the rest of the country, although the PCV was not in routine use during the recruitment period (WHO, 2016) . Second, almost one-third of the children had received antibiotics prior to collection of blood sample, which reduces the yield of blood culture by around 45% (Berkley et al., 2005; Rhodes et al., 2010; Driscoll et al., 2017; O'Brien et al., 2019) . Small blood volume is another factor known to compromise the sensitivity of blood culture (Berkley et al., 2005; Bouza et al., 2007; Driscoll et al., 2017) . Blood collection is challenging in children, especially in infants. Blood volumes collected for each child were not recorded in this study but, in practice, around 1 mL was dedicated for blood culture in most cases, despite the 2-3 mL recommended in the protocol. Nevertheless, these findings confirm the low yield of blood culture in hospitalized children with pneumonia and question both the need of blood culture for uncomplicated cases of pneumonia and using blood culture as the preferred screening tool for invasive bacterial disease in children with pneumonia. Molecular methods have been found to be more sensitive than blood culture to detect pneumococcal invasive disease (Mu\u00f1ozalmagro et al., 2011; Selva et al., 2013; O'Brien et al., 2019) .

However, evidence of the detection of viruses in asymptomatic individuals has raised concern about the clinical significance of these positive findings. Attribution of causality is not straightforward, as viruses can commonly be found both in symptomatic but also asymptomatic individuals (Jartti et al., 2008; Ruuskanen et al., 2011; Rudan et al., 2013; O'Brien et al., 2019) . While the causative role of RSV, influenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and bocavirus in childhood pneumonia is wellestablished, the pathogenic role of other viruses such as rhinovirus is still questioned (Fry et al., 2007; Caracciolo et al., 2008; Ruuskanen et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2017; Jayaweera et al., 2018; O'Brien et al., 2019) . Using molecular methods, rhinovirus has been shown to be the most frequent respiratory pathogen isolated in children, and its detection in asymptomatic children is significantly higher than other respiratory viruses (Kusel et al., 2006; Jartti et al., 2008; Ruuskanen et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, clinical relevance of rhinovirus has been proven by the association of this virus with respiratory symptoms in children, mainly wheezing (Kusel et al., 2006; Khetsuriani et al., 2007) . In our series, 27.5% of the children with rhinovirus presented with wheezing. Infection with coronavirus (Cor229E, CorHKU1, CorNL63, CorOC43) was low in the present study. Similarly, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) seems to cause a low infection rate in children (World Health Organization, 2020). The reason why coronavirus infection rate in children is low is unknown.",

Co-infections were common in the present study, which is consistent with the existing literature (Ruuskanen et al., 2011; Jroundi et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2017) . Considering radiological pneumonia endpoint as a proxy for bacterial pneumonia, 27.0% of children with positive NPW findings had a viral-bacterial co-infection, and 40.0% of children with influenza detected in NPW had an influenzabacterial co-infection. The contribution of viral-bacterial coinfections is well-acknowledged in the aetiology of childhood pneumonia, particularly the interaction between influenza virus and S. pneumoniae (O'Brien et al., 2000; Kwofie et al., 2012; Brealey et al., 2015) . The combined effect of bacteria and viruses was shown to increase the severity of the disease, and bidirectional interactions have been described: respiratory viruses leading to bacterial superinfection, and bacteria pathogens promoting respiratory viral superinfections (Brealey et al., 2015) . However, there is still a lack of robustness supporting these findings. This study has several limitations. Most children in the present study lived in Thimphu, and the microbiological findings may not be generalized to the rest of the country. Bhutan is very diverse: comprised of cities, such as Thimphu, and isolated households in very remote areas, leading to different lifestyles and environmental exposures; and also diverse in terms of altitude, with different climates and precipitations.",

Together with the relatively low proportion of children presenting a likely bacterial pneumoniaaround a quarter as per positive blood culture and radiological findingsthese findings emphasize the advanced stage of the epidemiologic transition that Bhutan seems to have reached. This study is the first step to better understand the aetiology and clinicopathological characteristics of pneumonia in Bhutanese children. Henceforth, the development of targeted pneumonia interventions and hypothesis-driven research is encouraged to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Fostering a robust pneumonia aetiology surveillance in children under five years of age appears important and would allow the assessment of the impact of the recently introduced PCV in reducing the burden of pneumonia.",
