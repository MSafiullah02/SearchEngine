Many of these mediators are cytokines and chemokines. Cytokines belong to a group of signaling proteins that are secreted by various cells after cellular activation (Foster 2001). Growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines are types of cytokines. Chemokines play an important role in recruiting inflammatory and immune cells to the site of infection or inflammation. They are also known as chemoattractant cytokines (Foster 2001). The typical structure of a chemokine consists of a configuration of four cysteine residues. Depending on the presence or absence of amino acid between the first two cysteine residues, chemokines are classified into two main subfamilies, CXC (alpha) and CC (beta), with the X denoting one amino acid that separates the two terminal cysteines (Fig. 1). The configuration of chemokines in the CC subfamily consists of two adjacent cysteines (Fernandez and Lolis 2002).\n",

The biological functions of chemokines occur after activating specific G protein-coupled protein receptors found on the surface of a variety of cells including monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and platelets (Menten et al. 2002b). Upon activation, chemokines induce migration and accumulation of inflammatory cells at the source of chemokine production. It is interesting to note that chemokines can bind to more than one chemokine receptor (Fig. 2). For example, chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3), a chemoattractant cytokine associated with the recruitment of leukocytes in response to tissue injury or inflammation, can bind to chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5 (Maurer and von Stebut 2004). Owing to these dual receptors, multiple cells can be recruited by this protein.\n",

It belongs to the CC chemokine family, which displays potent chemotactic properties. The MIP-1 protein was first identified by Stephen D. Wolpe in 1988. His research group reported the appearance of a new heparin-binding protein from the murine macrophage cell line in response to endotoxin stimulation. This protein was called macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) because of its biological function of inducing an inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil infiltration (Wolpe et al. 1988). The initial report of the separation of MIP-1 on SDS-PAGE gel was described by Sherry et al. (1988). Their findings suggested that the MIP-1 protein was composed of two peptides. Partial sequencing revealed two proteins: MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2. Although these proteins exhibited slight variation in the sequence of amino acid residue at their NH2 terminals, they share approximately 56.7 % sequence homology (Sherry et al. 1988).

Many researchers have independently isolated human and murine MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 in their laboratories. For this reason, MIP-1\u03b1 has more than one name in published reports. However, with the introduction of the new nomenclature, human MIP-1\u03b1 is currently called chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3), and MIP-1\u03b2 is called chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4) (Zlotnik and Yoshie 2000).",

Monocytes, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells are known to secrete MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 (Fig. 3) (Menten et al. 2002a, b). Under normal conditions, synthesis of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 occurs at very low levels. However, upon stimulation of receptive cells with endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Suzuki et al. 2000), virus proteins (Melchjorsen et al. 2003), or pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2) (Standiford et al. 1993a), cellular signaling events are activated, and this activation induces increased production of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3. MIP-1\u03b1 levels are regulated by certain transcriptional factors. MIP-1 alpha nuclear protein (MNP) is one such transcriptional factor that induces the transcription of the MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 gene (Ritter et al. 1995). On the other hand, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to inhibit the expression of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 from cells (dendritic cells) previously exposed to LPS (Jing et al. 2003). Non-hematopoietic cells such as osteoblasts (Kukita et al. 1997) and epithelial cells (Ryu et al. 2007) can secrete MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 upon stimulation. MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 is found to be one of the chemokines copiously expressed in inflamed gingival tissue and by oral epithelial keratinocytes (Gemmell et al. 2001; Kabashima et al. 2002; Ryu et al. 2007).\n",

After injury, vascular endothelial cells are activated (Fig. 5, step 1). The interaction between activated endothelial cells and leukocytes migrating in the circulatory system into the site of inflammation depends on cytokine production and endothelial adhesion molecules (Luscinskas et al. 1991). Unrestricted production of cytokines and chemokines can lead to tissue destruction (Fig. 5, step 3). Activated adhesion molecules help to retain leukocytes and transmigrate them into the inflamed tissues after injury (Fig. 5, step 4). It has been reported that intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) play an important role in the interaction between monocytes and endothelial cells to produce MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 (Lukacs et al. 1994). In vitro studies have shown a strong inflammatory reaction characterized by neutrophil accumulation after subcutaneous injection of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 into mice footpads (Wolpe et al. 1988). Thus, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 is suggested to play an important role in the inflammatory process by promoting the recruitment of leukocytes (PMNs, macrophages, and lymphocytes) to the site of inflammation.\n\n\n",

For example, upon exposure of lung tissue to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a strong inflammation response is induced by MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3. MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 induces recruitment and migration of eosinophils and basophils. Eosinophil degranulation results in severe tissue damage and is suggested to contribute to the pathological process triggered by viral infections (Garofalo et al. 1992). MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 is the most abundantly produced chemokine in mice infected with RSV, and respiratory epithelial cells and adjacent endothelial cells have been shown to be the major source of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3. Furthermore, transgenic mice lacking the MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 gene showed a marked decreased inflammatory response when infected with RSV (Haeberle et al. 2001). An increased level of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 has been detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with different lung diseases such as allergen-mediated asthma (Holgate et al. 1997), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Goodman et al. 1996), and pulmonary fibrosis (Ziegenhagen et al. 1998). Genetically altered MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 null mice infected with Coxsackie virus fail to develop myocarditis, and when inoculated with influenza virus, the degree of pulmonary inflammation was reduced (Cook 1996).

While CD4+ T lymphocytes are the primary target cells, chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 act as primary coreceptors for entry of the virus (Alfano and Poli 2005). Because MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 binds to the chemokine receptor CCR5, it can play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of HIV infection. Some CD4+ T cells secrete HIV-suppressive factors; hence, they are not preferentially infected with HIV (Abdelwahab et al. 2003). Apart from T lymphocytes, macrophages are well-known target cells that are infected with HIV. Macrophages infected with HIV exhibit increased levels of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 expression, and this expression correlates with viral replication (Canque et al. 1996). Various chemokines such as regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5), MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3, and MIP-1\u03b2/CCL4 demonstrate HIV-suppressive activity (Cocchi et al. 1995). Furthermore, experimental studies have shown antibodies against RANTES/CCL5, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3, and MIP-1\u03b2/CCL4 can entirely block HIV-suppressive activity (Cocchi et al. 1995). These findings suggest that chemokines have a potential role in the prevention and treatment of HIV infection.",

Macrophages can produce several enzymes that degrade infectious agents and induce phagocytosis (Fig. 5, step 6). Delayed wound healing and decreased phagocytic activities are found when the numbers of macrophages and monocytes are reduced (Leibovich and Ross 1975). Mediators such as MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 may help promote wound healing activity by recruiting macrophages to the site of tissue injury. An in vitro study by DiPietro et al. reported an increase in MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 mRNA expression and protein levels after excisional wound injury. Furthermore, they also reported that neutralization of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 by anti-MIP-1a antiserum decreases collagen synthesis activity, angiogenic activity, and the number of infiltrating macrophages (DiPietro et al. 1998).

A strong positive correlation exists between bone resorption markers such as urine deoxypyridinoline (UDPD), serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (S-BALP), and serum MIP-1 levels (MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 and MIP-1\u03b2/CCL4) in patients with multiple lytic bone lesions (Hashimoto et al. 2004). Also, serum MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 levels correlate with the severity and prognosis of MM (Terpos et al. 2003, 2005).

Wu et al. reported that CCL3-CCR5 axis may play an important role in enhancing various tumor cell functions including tumor metastasis (Wu et al. 2008). They found increased expression of the CCR5 receptor and not the CCR1 receptor in mice injected with renal cell carcinoma, a cancer known to metastasize to the bone. Their reports suggest that CCL3-CCR5 axis contributes to neovascularization by enhancing MMP-9 expression which can help degrade extracellular matrix. Furthermore, the CCL3-CCR5 axis may help in tumor progression by increasing HGF-expressing fibroblasts (angiogenic factor). The concept of tumor migration is based on the ability of chemokines to attract tumor cells to secondary sites. Thus, the quantity of chemokines produced by lymphoma or leukemia cells and the types of chemokines present at distant sites of metastasis may determine the migration of tumor cells (Menten et al. 2002a).",

The two main subsets of T lymphocytes are CD4 (helper T cells) and CD8 (cytotoxic T cells). These cells are known to produce generous amount of cytokines and are broadly categorized as Th-1-type cytokines and Th-2-type cytokines. Th-1 cytokines are potent pro-inflammatory mediators and are responsible for maintaining autoimmune responses. However, a large quantity of these pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce unobstructed tissue damage. Thus, there is a need to counterbalance the mediators that promote unrestricted tissue destruction. Th-2-type cytokines induce an anti-inflammatory response, thereby counteracting the functions of Th-1 cytokines. In general, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 and MIP-1\u03b2/CCL4 play a key role in determining the responses of lymphocytes. For example, MIP-1\u03b2/CCL4 selectively attracts activated CD4+ T cells (helper), and MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 preferentially attracts activated CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic) (Taub et al. 1993).",

The tooth penetrates the integument and is the only interface in the body where a calcified structure is in contact with the external environment and is subjected to colonization by bacteria. This tooth-associated biofilm confers a degree of protection and allows some degree of metabolic cooperation between the members of the community. Microbes are held in contiguity with the delicate epithelium that lines the gingival sulcus (a potential space between the tooth and gum). If allowed to remain in situ, the increasing anaerobic and gram-negative flora will elicit an inflammatory host response. Influx of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells and macrophages takes place after activation of the immune reaction (Fig. 6). The exposure of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces the initiation of various inflammatory cells to stimulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in the gingival connective tissue. Chemokines are upregulated during the course of periodontal disease as a result of the interaction between the bacterial proteins and cellular surface receptors. Experiments have shown that MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 expression is induced by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells and gingival epithelial cells and not by gingival fibroblasts and human MG63 osteosarcoma cells (osteoblastic cells) when subjected to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin (IL-1\u03b2) (Ryu et al. 2007). Epithelial keratinocytes in the oral cavity can produce various chemokines such as MCP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3, and interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10/CXCL10) (Gemmell et al. 2001).

It predominantly affects children and usually involves molars and incisors. Patients often exhibit levels of bacterial plaque that are inconsistent with the amount of periodontal tissue destruction. An increased incidence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), a gram-negative bacteria, is a predominant feature of this disease. The local host inflammatory response is characterized by intense infiltration of PMNs, macrophages, and lymphocytes, predominantly plasma cells (about 70 %) (Liljenberg and Lindhe 1980). Activated cells produce unrestricted expression of cytokines and chemokines that can further stimulate cells to produce prostaglandin E2 and tissue-degrading enzymes (Masada et al. 1990; Offenbacher et al. 1993; Okada and Murakami 1998).",

Three subject groups were studied: seven subjects who developed localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) with clinical signs of bone loss, seven healthy subjects with no bone loss (Aa+), and seven healthy subjects with no bone loss (Aa\u2212). Fine et al. found significantly higher levels (about 50 fold) of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 from subjects in the LAgP Aa+ group than the healthy control groups. Furthermore, levels of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 were found to be higher 6\u20139 months before the detection of bone loss. Although the number of study subjects was small, this study demonstrates the potential role of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 in promoting macrophage recruitment and osteoclast activation. The fact that MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 levels were higher before the detection of bone loss suggests that this protein may play a role as a biomarker for detecting patients at risk of bone loss during the course of periodontitis.",

Also, a substantial amount of damage must take place before these diagnostic measures can detect disease activity. Hence, scientists are attempting to develop new diagnostics for detecting ongoing periodontal disease at an early stage. New diagnostics should be able to provide information about the extent of current disease activity as well as determine which patients are highly susceptible for future disease progression. Recently, the use of serum, saliva, and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in clinical research has provided insight into the pathogenesis of periodontitis and potential biomarkers that may have diagnostic utility. Currently, oral fluid biomarkers such as enzymes (collagenase), host cells (PMN), bacteria (Aa, Porphyromonas gingivalis), bacterial products (LPS), and immunoglobulin (IgA) show potential for detecting periodontal disease (Khashu et al. 2012).",

Salivary concentrations of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 also demonstrate a strong positive correlation with clinical parameters of periodontal disease. In addition to correlating with disease severity, salivary levels of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 have been shown to reflect response to therapy (Sexton et al. 2011). Tymkiv et al. reported that the level of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 is lower in subjects with periodontitis who smoke than in similar subjects who do not smoke (Tymkiw et al. 2011). This finding could be because smoking impairs the immune response (Palmer et al. 2005). Although MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 appears to be a good salivary biomarker of periodontitis, one study reports that concentrations of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 in gingival crevicular fluid were not different in subjects presenting with increasing severities of periodontal diseases (i.e., gingivitis or chronic and aggressive periodontitis) (Emingil et al. 2005).

Several studies have shown that the progression of peri-implantitis results in a markedly higher rate of implant failure (Sakka et al. 2012). In as much as peri-implantitis is a major cause of implant failure, various salivary biomarkers have been investigated for the detection of peri-implantitis (Arakawa et al. 2012; Fonseca et al. 2012). Reports of cytokine and chemokine level in peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) provide valuable information about the health status of dental implants. To date, at least one study has shown that levels of PICF MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 and IL-1\u03b2 are significantly higher in patients with peri-implantitis than in patients with healthy implants (Petkovic et al. 2010).",

Likewise, MM patients with more than three lytic lesions exhibit higher serum MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 concentrations than MM patients with fewer (less than 3) lytic lesions (Terpos et al. 2005) suggesting that serum MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 levels and markers of bone resorption correlate with disease severity of MM (Terpos et al. 2003; Hashimoto et al. 2004), but less so with periodontal disease.",

Because MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 is a potent macrophage chemotaxin, its role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis is significant. Patients with sarcoidosis exhibit higher concentrations of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and a 2.5-fold increase in chemotactic activity when compared to control subjects. Also, reductions in chemotaxis of approximately 22 % were observed in the presence of anti-MIP-1\u03b1 antibodies (Standiford et al. 1993b). These findings suggest that the plasma concentration of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 is related to the disease activity of sarcoidosis. Patients with active sarcoidosis, including both systemic and pulmonary involvement, showed a marked increase in plasma levels of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 (Hashimoto et al. 1998). However, patients with predominantly pulmonary involvement without any systemic manifestation also showed elevated concentrations of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3. Thus, the plasma concentration of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 can provide valuable information about potential extrathoracic disease activity in patients with sarcoidosis and can correlate with disease activity.",

Reports have shown that a genetic mutation of the chromosome (11q14-21) that results in complete loss of cathepsin C activity is responsible for the development of PLS (Hart et al. 1999). These patients exhibit severe periodontitis, which involves uncontrolled destruction of connective tissue and alveolar bone resorption. This occurs because of the downregulation of cathepsin C that impedes the activation of neutrophil serine proteinases such as cathepsin G, proteinase 3, and elastase (de Haar et al. 2004). Neutrophil serine proteinases are important for maintaining host immune functions. Patients with PLS demonstrate impaired proteolysis of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 because of the inactivity of neutrophil serine proteinases resulting in severe periodontal destruction attributed to excessive buildup of MIP-1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\alpha $$\\end{document}\u03b1/CCL3 (Ryu et al. 2005).",

It is genetically associated with HLA antigen DR4 (Gran et al. 1983). During the progression of this disease, inflamed synovial joints are infiltrated by various inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The activated cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, which further mediates inflammatory synovitis and induces matrix metalloproteinase to promote collagen fiber destruction. Macrophages also play an important role in secreting chemokines involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatic arthritis. MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 expression is higher in synovial fluid and serum from RA patients than in these fluids from patients with osteoarthritis (Koch et al. 1994). Increased levels of MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 mRNA and protein also have been found in macrophages from the synovial tissue from RA patients. The higher expression can be attributed to an increase in the recruitment of macrophages and T cells into the areas of inflamed synovium by MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3. Likewise, increased expression of the chemokine receptor for MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3, CCR5, occurs in RA patients (Patel et al. 2001).",
