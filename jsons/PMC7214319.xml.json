Protective measures were enacted to avoid overtaxing the capacity of health care systems (termed flattening the curve)2. Among these protective measures were institutional and governmental bans on performing \u2018elective\u2019 procedures. The goal was two-fold\u2026to promote social distancing that slows the spread of the virus, and to preserve personal protective equipment and hospital resources, including ventilators and manpower. Consensus groups in both Europe and the U.S. provided guidance regarding the definition of \u2018essential\u2019 surgery and proposed a \u2018tiered\u2019 approach to surgical triage3. Although the application of these guidelines likely varied among countries and regions, there was near universal acceptance that radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, post-chemotherapy RPLND for testis cancer, partial or radical nephrectomy for clinical T2 renal cell cancer, and radical prostatectomy for high risk prostate cancer were \u2018essential.\u2019 This is in addition to \u2018conventional\u2019 urologic emergencies such as testicular torsion, Fournier's gangrene, symptomatic ureteral stones with hydronephrosis/sepsis, and the like4.",

It is theorized that the evacuation of pneumoperitoneum and the aspiration of body fluids are \u2018aerosol generating procedures\u2019 that could transmit viral particles18. The American College of Surgeons has gone so far as to recommend that we \u201cconsider avoiding laparoscopy19\u201d. Conversely, The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) stated that \u201calthough previous research has shown that laparoscopy can lead to aerosolization of blood-borne viruses, there is no evidence to indicate that this effect is seen with COVID-19, nor that it would be isolated to MIS procedures20.\u201d They further suggested that laparoscopic surgery may actually offer better filtration of the majority of aerosolized particles as compared to open surgery.
