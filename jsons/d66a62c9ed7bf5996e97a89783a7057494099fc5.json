Loss is a more encompassing theme in our life, however. Losses not only involve separations from those we love, but also interweave many other aspects of our life in this crisis.

Grieving process reflects a unique convergence of responses (affective, cognitive, behavioural, physical, spiritual adjustments). Individuals having patients or family with severe complications of COVID-19 may experience anticipatory grief. For frontline healthcare workers, the huge surge in deaths is distressing. They experience anticipatory grief and perceive discontinuation of mechanical ventilation as emotionally onerous and psychologically difficult, but having little time for mourning due to the intensifying situation. Many families experience anticipatory grief because 5 knowing their loved ones suffering and missing out on the final moment are poignant. Moreover, the absence of ritual, such as funeral, often results in disenfranchised grief, and lacking social or cultural recognition impairs support resources that assist the grieving process. As a result of unusual prolonged and disabling grief, more individuals are at greater risk of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in this pandemic. PGD will imperil mental and physical wellbeing consequently because of the disturbance causing significant impairment in essential areas of functioning.",

            "text": "Increasing knowledge of the idiosyncratic nature of loss and grief is essential to inform the development of tailored strategies to help grievers adapt to loss in this challenging time. First, loss adaptation should be preferred over loss coping. Adaptation allows grievers to continually adjust to ongoing changes posed by the crisis. Contrastingly, coping implies a time-limited response to an event with specific skills (Corr and Doka, 2001) . Second, mental health professionals should encourage the exploration and employment of adaptive strategies (affective, cognitive, behavioural, physical, spiritual) consistent with grievers' personality and varying situations. Third, meaning reconstruction promotes functional adaptation to loss. Significant losses cause the disruptions of beliefs and expectations constituting one's meaning structures, which yields cognitive dissonance that results in substantial distress, hampering functional loss adaptation. By helping grievers understand and rebuild disrupted beliefs and expectations, mental health professionals can facilitate grievers' functional integration of loss and help them reconnect to self and the world. Lastly, identifying and developing resilience traits, such as selfefficacy and social support, will empower grievers to adapt to disturbances in the grieving 6 process (Vegsund et al., 2019) . It is therefore crucial to help grievers recognize strengths and abilities to amplify individual resilience.",
