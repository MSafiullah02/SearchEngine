From the 19th century to the present, human activities, including the introduction of invasive animal and plant species, have negatively impacted Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystems (Snell et al., 2002, MacFarland and Cifuentes, 1996). In other island ecosystems, such as Hawaii, anthropogenic introduction of exotic vertebrate and invertebrate species is linked to the emergence of infectious disease (e.g., avian malaria and avian pox) and subsequent decline in many native bird species (Van Riper III et al., 1986, Atkinson et al., 1995).",

Domestic chickens are present on Santa Cruz, Isabela, San Cristobal, Floreana, and Baltra (Fig. 1). Three types of poultry farming are practiced on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands: small-scale backyard meat chickens (1\u201340 birds per farm) (Fig. 2\n), small to medium-scale egg layers, and medium to relatively large-scale commercial broiler operations (2000\u20134000 birds) (Fig. 3\n). Currently, there are 23 broiler chicken farms on Santa Cruz, 6 on San Cristobal, and 4 on Isabela. In the past five to ten years, poultry production has intensified due to demand from the growing human population and tourist industry. Under Gal\u00e1pagos law, broiler chickens, brought to Gal\u00e1pagos at 1\u20135 days of age, must be unvaccinated and certified as healthy by approved aviculture facilities on the Ecuadorian mainland. Currently, no livestock vaccinations are permitted on the Galapagos Islands (David Cruz, SICGAL, personal communication). Feral populations of chickens exist on Santa Cruz, Isabela, San Cristobal, and Floreana. In addition to the risk of introducing disease into native Galapagos avifauna, waste from domestic poultry operations may have detrimental effects on local plant and animal communities in the Galapagos due to nutrient enrichment and water contamination.",

This monitoring serves to identify pathogens that pose a particular risk to native populations and helps to target certain pathogens for future disease surveillance. A similar approach to identifying high-risk pathogens has been performed for killer whales (Orcinus orca) (Gaydos et al., 2004). Here, we present results of poultry disease surveys from 2001 to 2003 in relation to their threat to native birds, discuss ecological threats of broiler aviculture and backyard chickens to Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystems, identify disease research priorities, and discuss potential strategies for the control and prevention of disease transmission to native birds.",

Blood was collected in lithium heparin tubes. Plasma aliquots were stored in liquid nitrogen in the field and transferred to \u221270 \u00b0C ultrafreezer before serologic testing. Plasma from birds collected between July 2001 and September 2003 was antibody tested for the following diseases (antibody testing method in parenthesis): influenza A/avian influenza (agar gel immunodiffusion \u2013 AGID); avian adenovirus group II/hemorrhagic enteritis of turkeys (AGID); avian paramyxovirus I/Newcastle disease (hemagglutination inhibition \u2013 HI); Pasteurella multocida (fowl cholera) (microscopic agglutination \u2013 MA); Mycoplasma gallisepticum (hemagglutination inhibition \u2013 HI); Salmonella typhimurium (tube agglutination) and Salmonella pullorum (tube agglutination) at the Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Missouri \u2013 Columbia, Columbia, MO 65205. Further aliquots were antibody tested for avian encephalomyelitis (AGID), avian adenovirus group-I (AGID), Marek\u2019s disease virus (AGID), infectious bursal disease virus (AGID), avian paramyxoviruses 2 and 3 (HI), and avian reovirus (immunoflourescent antibody testing) at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, IA 50010. Ten of these birds were tested for Chlamydophila psittaci by elementary body analysis at the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, College Station, TX 77841. Of the samples collected in November 2003, blood smears were examined for hemoparasites. Serotests were performed for Newcastle disease, reovirus, infectious bronchitis virus, infectious bursal disease, Mycoplasma sp., and avian influenza using an IDEXX Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) at LAFAVET Laboratories, Quito, Ecuador. Different diagnostic test methods were used for serology of the November 2003 samples as compared to the July 2001 and 2002 serotests.

Complete post-mortem examinations (gross and microscopic examination) were performed on all birds except those from the November 2003 collections in San Cristobal, where only serum was taken. Representative samples of major organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (fixed tissue samples were transferred to ethanol to facilitate international transportation). Tissues were routinely processed for light microscopic histopathology (hematoxylin and eosin staining) at the Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Columbia, MO 65205, USA. Subsequent samples were routinely processed at AXXIS and Astrid Rhon laboratories, Quito, Ecuador. Tissues from each bird were examined by a veterinary pathologist (T.W., N.G.) for microscopic lesions. In one bird, further paraffin sections were evaluated for Toxoplasma gondii antigen using polyclonal antibody 125P (GioGenex, San Ramon, CA 94583) and streptavidin, and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) chromagen detection. Appropriate positive and negative controls were run simultaneously. Helminths and ectoparasites retrieved during necropsy were placed in 10% formalin and transferred to absolute ethanol or placed directly in ethanol for examination. Preserved specimens were identified by a parasitologist (M. Dailey). In some cases, parasites were only present in histologic sections and they were identified as morphological features allowed. Therefore, sample sizes for evaluation of prevalence of particular parasites differed between parasites.",

            "text": "Pathology and serology studies from 2001 to 2003 show evidence of a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases in introduced chickens of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Although some diseases are chicken-specific, many pathogens identified are not species-specific and pose an imminent threat to native avifauna. Seropositivity was detected for 11 of 18 chicken pathogens tested and eight of these pathogens were detected in over 15% of chickens tested. This relatively high pathogen prevalence may be due in part to sample bias. Most chickens in this study appeared clinically normal. However, eight of 172 chickens in this study were clinically ill and many of the samples collected in the July 2001 to September 2003 surveys included chickens from farms with a history of disease, thus potentially over-estimating the true prevalence of disease among the Gal\u00e1pagos domestic chicken population. Additionally, broiler chickens may be seropositive not due to previous or current infection, but due to vaccination of adults on the islands or of chicks purchased from broiler suppliers on the Ecuadorian continent, despite the prohibition on vaccination. Although potential sample bias may overestimate the true prevalence of pathogens in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, we believe that, in the presence of uncertainty, slight over-estimation of disease prevalence is prudent when evaluating the potential of disease transmission from domestic poultry to Gal\u00e1pagos endemic avifauna, many of which have naturally small populations.",

In Argentina, adenovirus antibody prevalence similar to that in our study was associated with poor hygienic conditions on commercial poultry farms (Gonzalez et al., 1978). The seroprevalence for infectious bronchitis virus in our study resembled that in backyard poultry operations in villages of the Yucatan Peninsula (56%) and may be a common cause of respiratory disease in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens as well (Gutierrez-Ruiz et al., 2000). Comparable serologic results were also seen for Avian encephalomyelitis presence in fancy chickens from Switzerland. In this study, relatively high pathogen prevalence was associated with close contact and group rearing of similar chicken age classes (Wunderwald and Hoop, 2002).",

            "text": "Our study shows serologic evidence of Newcastle Disease in chickens from San Cristobal Island. Newcastle disease shows high pathogenicity in many species that are related to Gal\u00e1pagos endemics. Newcastle disease causes high mortality in the double-crested cormorant Phalacrocorax auritis (Docherty and Friend, 1999, Banerjee et al., 1994, Wobeser et al., 1993), a congener of the flightless cormorant Phalacrocorax harrisi. In 1992 and 2000, disease outbreaks attributed to velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease caused the death of over 2000 and 500 chickens, respectively, on Santa Cruz Island. Disease eradication plans were implemented by selective culling (Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganader\u00eda, Direcci\u00f3n Provincial Agropecuaria de Gal\u00e1pagos). However, antibodies to Newcastle disease were not detected in Santa Cruz chickens tested in our study. Explanations for this finding include potential false negative serotests, low sample size, and local eradication of disease during the outbreak of 1999\u20132000. Newcastle disease antibodies were detected in broiler chickens from San Cristobal in November 2003 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although the chickens tested appeared relatively normal, necropsy findings on abbatoir chickens from the seropositive flock are consistent with a Newcastle disease strain of low to moderate pathogenicity. Potential sources of Newcastle disease virus are domestic pigeons (Alexander, 2003), contaminated equipment (Alexander, 1988), illegal transport of cock-fighting birds between islands, migratory birds, or introduction of infected birds or poultry products from the Ecuadorian mainland.",

Gulls, pelicans, penguins, and cormorants are among the highly susceptible groups of wild birds (Docherty and Friend, 1999). Consequently, lava gulls (Larus fuliginosus), flightless cormorants (P. harrisi) and Gal\u00e1pagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus), endemic species with small population sizes (<1500 individuals), may be particularly susceptible to infection. A 1997 outbreak of a highly pathogenic strain of Newcastle disease caused nesting failure and more than 2000 deaths in a double-crested cormorant colony in the Salton Sea, southern California (Docherty and Friend, 1999). Clearly, Newcastle disease, present in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, has the potential to cause severe decline or extinction of the flightless cormorant population. Continued surveys of domestic chickens and wild birds for Newcastle disease as well as the isolation, molecular characterization and pathogenicity typing of Newcastle disease strains present on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are necessary to prevent and manage the disease.",

A variant of M. gallisepticum associated with domestic poultry or pen-reared wild turkeys (Luttrell et al., 2001) has caused severe conjunctivitis in house finches (C. mexicanus), resulting in population declines (Dhondt et al., 1998, Pillai et al., 2003). Although antibodies to M. gallisepticum were detected in two wild Gal\u00e1pagos passerines (Ricaurte, 1994), susceptibility to mycoplasmal infection of native Gal\u00e1pagos avifauna is unknown. Conjunctivitis, sinusitis, and rhinitis of undetermined etiology have been observed in finches and mockingbirds on Isabela and Santa Cruz (Jim\u00e9nez and Gottdenker, personal observation).

IBD is a Birnavirus that causes necrosis of the lymphoid tissues (Sivanandan and Maheswaran, 1980, Lukert and Saif, 2003) resulting in immunosuppression that allows the emergence of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections (Charlton, 2000). Relatively high antibody titers to IBD were detected in herring gulls in the Baltic Sea (Hollmen et al., 2000) and free-ranging Antarctic penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae and Aptenodyes forsteri) (Gardner et al., 1997). It remains unknown whether IBD is pathogenic to endemic birds such as lava gulls (L. fuliginosus) and Gal\u00e1pagos penguins (S. mendiculus). Regardless, a very pathogenic strain of IBD has recently invaded South America (Enzo and Yannick, 2003). If introduced to Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, this strain may cause proliferation of a variety of pathogens in domestic flocks that may spillover into wild bird populations. Furthermore, penguins and flightless cormorants may have contact with infected chicken products via increasing tourist and fishing activities in Western Gal\u00e1pagos and local migrants such as yellow warblers that may carry the disease from inhabited to uninhabited regions. Diseases such as infectious bursal disease as reported in Antarctic penguins (Gardner et al., 1997) could be transmitted to these populations by contact with chicken waste.",

Experimental studies suggest that the only wild bird species susceptible to Marek\u2019s disease would be in the Order Galliformes (Pradhan et al., 1985, Cho and Kenzy, 1975). There are no native galliform species in the Gal\u00e1pagos, therefore the risk of Marek\u2019s disease is low. Indeed, a study of Marek\u2019s disease on the Gal\u00e1pagos penguin in 1996 gave negative results (Miller et al., 2001).",

D. proglottina, identified in some chickens, may cause enteritis in wild birds (Permin and Hansen, 1998). Capillaria sp. present in chickens may infect a variety of avian species, causing high levels of mortality in heavy infections (Barnes, 1986). Many species of North American passerines are highly susceptible to infection with the proventricular nematode (Dispharynx sp.) (Rickard, 1985) (Table 2). In heavy infections, Dispharynx sp. can cause illness, particularly in juvenile birds (Rickard, 1985, Forrester and Spalding, 2003). A number of mortalities in Gal\u00e1pagos dark billed cuckoos were attributed to Dispharynx spiralis (Vargas and Bensted-Smith, 2000). Because Dispharynx has a large host range, poultry may not be the only source of potential infection for Gal\u00e1pagos endemics, as different species or subspecies of this parasite may have been present on the Gal\u00e1pagos before the introduction of chickens. Regardless, heavy infections of Dispharynx sp. in chickens, combined with an abundance of suitable intermediate hosts (e.g., isopods), may be a source of infection for native birds.",

It is also difficult and expensive to monitor the certified aviculture companies on the Ecuadorian mainland for diseases that pose a threat to wild birds. Implementation of biosecurity protocols in broiler facilities that minimize contact with wild birds is relatively straightforward. Unfortunately, many broiler houses on the Gal\u00e1pagos do not follow strict biosecurity protocols and have inadequate broiler house construction, allowing for direct contact between some native bird species. Unlike backyard chickens living in relatively low densities, high densities in broiler farms may increase contact rates between infected individuals and provide a highly concentrated pathogen source, facilitating disease spread to wild birds and backyard chickens. Additionally, high concentrations of poultry in broiler houses may provide an ideal opportunity for recombination to occur between strains of a pathogen, potentially resulting in the emergence of a pathogen with increased virulence for other avian species.",

Over-application of poultry litter to agricultural fields may cause leaching of nitrate into groundwater (Andres, 1995, Gordillo and Cabrera, 1997). Increased nitrogen load may alter plant community composition and successional dynamics (Tilman, 1987). Higher soil nitrogen levels may facilitate the growth of detrimental invasive species present in the Gal\u00e1pagos, such as blackberry (Rubus sp.). Additionally, a change in plant species composition or vegetation structure may also alter avian bird community composition (Wilson and Belcher, 1989) and nesting success (Remes, 2003).

Future research on the impact of Gal\u00e1pagos broiler farms on disease threats and ecosystem processes is important to natural resource management and environmental conservation. In the meantime, practices that minimize negative ecological impacts and disease spread from poultry litter (e.g., mandatory composting) should be implemented.",

Chickens also harbor infectious diseases that pose a risk to native bird populations and human public health on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. However, eradication of all chickens on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is an economic, political, and social impossibility.

            "text": "Improved health management of Gal\u00e1pagos chickens can prevent the introduction of potentially devastating infectious diseases. For example, Newcastle disease, historically and serologically present in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, may cause high poultry mortality and decline or extinction in endangered native birds, such as the flightless cormorant. A policy decision needs to be made whether to eradicate or control Newcastle disease on the Gal\u00e1pagos. Vaccination of poultry flocks is controversial, because animal vaccination is prohibited in the Gal\u00e1pagos. Vaccines can control, but not eradicate Newcastle disease, and could result in transfer of Newcastle disease to wild bird species if modified-live or live vaccines are used. From the perspective of wild bird conservation, Newcastle disease eradication would be the best management strategy. Test and slaughter programs in order to eradicate Newcastle disease in Gal\u00e1pagos poultry should be considered. However, eradication strategies are politically and economically difficult because funds are needed to compensate farmers for the deaths of birds that test positive. Furthermore, disease eradication strategies have the potential to cause the avicultural sector to mistrust local disease control programs, hindering further disease reporting, investigation, and control. Before eradication plans are implemented, the strains, pathogenicity, and possible origins of Newcastle disease present in Gal\u00e1pagos poultry should be identified, and poultry producers must be educated regarding disease control strategies. In order to better evaluate the pathogenicity of disease on endemic Gal\u00e1pagos avifauna, ex situ experimental infection of endemic birds (e.g., ground finches) with pathogens isolated from Gal\u00e1pagos chickens would be ideal, but small population sizes preclude disease transmission studies in endemics such as the mangrove finch, medium tree finch, flightless cormorant, and Gal\u00e1pagos penguin.",

            "text": "Currently, avian disease surveillance programs in the Gal\u00e1pagos monitor wild bird populations for poultry-borne and other infectious diseases. Results of these studies will guide avian disease management policies on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Further studies are also needed regarding the effects of broiler operations on local ecosystems. Regardless, eradication, prevention, and control of disease and ecological effects of poultry production on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands rely on well designed, scientifically based government policies and local community participation. These policies must be flexible, vigilant (e.g., unexpected introduction of avian influenza), transparent to the general public, and quick to respond to emergency situations. Viable economic alternatives to high-intensity broiler production on the Gal\u00e1pagos are important to develop due to the ecological and disease threats they present. A contingency plan that will enable rapid response for the successful mitigation of disease outbreaks of Gal\u00e1pagos native birds and poultry is necessary and urgent. Such a plan should identify national and international collaborators and laboratories for diagnosis of pathogens, budget costs, establish operational agreements, and maintain permits to facilitate the action plan when abnormal mortality of native birds or poultry is encountered.",
