The primary objective when evaluating patients who have acute cough complaints is often to exclude pneumonia [3]. However, the goal of the emergency physician is to differentiate non-emergent causes from emergencies such as pulmonary embolism, CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation, etc. A thorough history and physical examination are important to guide diagnosis, and vital sign abnormalities can often distinguish these illnesses. The American College of Chest Physicians has defined three categories of cough based on duration. Acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks, while a subacute cough lasts 3\u20138 weeks, and a chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks [4].",
