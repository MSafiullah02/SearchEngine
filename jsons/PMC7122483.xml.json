During the Cold War, when adversarial great-powers and their supporting blocs appeared to be perennially poised on the brink of catastrophic conflict, realism gained ground among national security establishments ruling dominant states. Grounded in the postulate that its practitioners perceived the world as it really was, an agglomeration of selfish Westphalian state-actors pursuing narrow self-aggrandising interests, without a central authority to moderate such Hobbesian tendencies, a world where the strong did what they wished and the weak did what they could to defend themselves, realist frameworks rationalised, if they did not breed, competitive policies.",

Pursuing a Kantian perspective of collaborative approaches to shared challenges and opportunities, they pushed a collegial line as an organising principle in both domestic politics and international relations. For much of the period, liberalism was largely associated with scholastic visionaries seeking to challenge practitioners with alternative concepts of the possibilities of managing interstate relations. However, even many leaders of post-colonial successor-states who refused openly to align themselves to either bloc of realism-driven competitors, preferring instead to form a non-aligned coalition, mixed liberal rhetoric with realist praxis.",

At its heart reposed the dominant system, a constellation of the world\u2019s great powers, inheriting their leading status from their victory in World War II. The dominant system itself radiated outward from the systemic core, a bipolar-binary construct comprising two adversarial superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, located at the peak of the global power-hierarchy. Their power, i.e., their capacity to promote favourable changes and prevent unwanted changes to the security environment, alongside their expansive interests and ambitions, so surpassed those of all others that they comprised a category unto themselves. This binary core was perceptibly driven, defined and shaped by an existential, zero-sum, strategic competition for global influence, if not control. As the superpowers threatened each other with cataclysmic thermonuclear devastation, should respective core interests be challenged, both were mutually deterred from initiating direct conflict.",

These constructs simplified complexities of the global political reality to the extent that formulaic application of these frameworks to policies addressing specific objectives guaranteed only partial success. The subordinate- and sub-systems, too, comprised competitive and cooperative elements, with some actors gaining from patron-client networks fashioned by the rival superpowers while others, at least formally, retained non-aligned independence of action. Patron\u2013client relations were usually formalised as alliances, generically described as intrusive systems, linking the systemic core to the periphery. As many of the non-aligned states were, in fact, tacit clients of either superpower, intrusive systems divided most of the planetary polity into rival camps. Since the superpowers desisted from direct conflict, their competition found expression in proxy-warfare among peripheral rival clients, whose ability to manage their local/regional disputes was eroded as systemic-subsystemic resonances deepened cleavages, raised stakes and intensified violence.",

Since both parties pursued this goal continually, peace secured with Mutual Assured Destruction, conceived after massive retaliation lost popularity, was perpetually precarious. This only changed when Soviet leaders, acknowledging after four decades the futility of unsustainable competition, changed course, before being swept away as the eviscerated Soviet Union fissioned into 15 fragile republics.",

With its only peer-rival removed from contention, the United States emerged as the sole superpower, the solitary core of a unipolar system. As no challenger questioned America\u2019s authority, this transition from a bipolar- to a unipolar core was largely untroubled. For many secondary and tertiary actors, in contrast, reorganising their domestic order and external relations simultaneously proved more traumatic. Some descended into civil-war, attracting external intervention with a view to restoring peace. But at the systemic core, unchallenged success bred a belief in the new order\u2019s indefinite immutability. For over a decade, the system-manager exercised hegemonic power in pursuit of its national interests, which were now seemingly reasonably conflated with global peace and stability. With fears of unpredictable but presumably semi-imminent and cataclysmic nuclear exchanges lifted, governmental focus in both the dominant and subordinate systems shifted to more urgent issues nearer home. This perceptual transformation allowed a dissipation of the starkly competitive ardour hitherto colouring national security policy-making in most dominant-system capitals.",

The direction of resource-flows changed from the West to the East, and from the North to the South. This process, eroding the systemic core\u2019s visibly unipolar attributes, triggered a gradual, mostly non-violent and possibly irreversible transition. However, by 2015, the core had not assumed definable contours of either an adversarial bipolarity, or a binary condominium. Nor had the system become definably multipolar, although aspects of all three paradigms became discernible. The post-Cold War dispensation had eroded but no new equilibrium had been established. The redistribution of resources, resultant transfers of power-capabilities and consequent changes in the global power-hierarchy precipitated systemic transitional fluidity noticeably since the late 1990s when the US national security establishment began identifying China as a near-peer-rival meriting close scrutiny. China denied hostile intent but responded in kind.",

Nonetheless, reality proved to be more complex than a monochromatic adherence to either school would suggest. As actors began to again rely on coercive deterrence to cope with the uncertainties triggered by systemic transitional fluidity, many of them, as members of multilateral institutions, also ceded elements of individual sovereignty, accepting instead institutionalised collective sovereignty, if only partially and reluctantly. The evolution of the European Union offered a model for other historically disputatious subordinate systems, but the fallout from the 2008\u20132010 Great Recession seemed to render wider acceptance and replication of this model momentarily moot.",

Power shifted horizontally from developed members of the dominant system to emerging economies within various subordinate systems, most prominently China, but also Russia, India, Brazil, as well as several hitherto tertiary actors, e.g., Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa. Most of these states were either allied to or aligned with America, or moving in that direction. So, in most cases, power-shift did not appear threatening to members of the erstwhile dominant system. The latter, after all, were almost equally concerned with the parallel process of vertical power-diffusion from states to increasingly active non-state, sub-state and supra-state actors. Supra-state organisations e.g., the UN, especially the UNSC, other UN organs, the World Bank, IMF, Asian Development Bank, the WTO, and similar bodies, often backed with US resources, expanded their influence over developing states seeking their help. Although sometimes considered unresponsive to acute human needs in the pursuit of their liberalising missions, intrusions by these bodies were not perceived as fundamentally threatening.",

Operating across state-boundaries with newly-acquired freedoms, they challenged state-sovereignty in ways that could not meaningfully be countered with either conventional might or nuclear-armed military forces. Rapidly developing information-and-communication technology and ubiquitous devices armed with it allowed myriad groups, ranging from separatist guerrillas and terrorist organisations to socio-cultural networks and citizens\u2019 collectives, to organise and operate more cohesively than before. This enabled them to demand and often secure autonomous space both within the states in which they were active, and beyond. In short, in the post-Cold War world, the number and categories of actors with a capacity to effect or prevent change multiplied dramatically.",

Global economic interdependence underscored the need for collaborative responses to the Great Recession. Global warming/climate change, pandemics like Ebola and SARS, internal wars in fragile states such as Syria, Libya, Congo and Sudan, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, state-collapse and the spread of violent extremism exemplified other challenges no one actor, however powerful, could address alone. Faced with the combined consequences of these trends and processes, the state\u2019s relative autonomy, its monopoly of organised violence, and capacity to marshal a unifying meta-narrative subordinating all local/parochial sub-narratives, declined. As the nature and effect of power within the state changed, so did the nature and effect of interstate power within the international system. The simultaneity of power-shift and power-diffusion thus altered both the state-society interface and the inter-state ecology in ways that are apparently still not entirely clear to those responsible for managing change.",

Economic interests often urged close ties to China, for instance, while strategic insecurity forged closer links to America. In the post-Cold War period, as many component-states began asserting their individual identities, most subordinate systems declined in significance in strategic discourse. In contrast, regional subsystems acquired a higher profile as potential hot-spots and fault-lines between contending interests pursued by the status-quo oriented systemic primate, and its existentially and presumably revisionist \u2018near-peer competitor\u2019. Since the 1990s, the West-Pacific subordinate-system, comprising North-Asian, East Asian and Southeast Asian sub-systems, as the focal point of Sino-US contention, attracted global attention. The competitive-cooperative but otherwise unstated and still-evolving Sino-US diarchy, with its competitive character only generally acknowledged in official commentary, either precipitated numerous security complexes or profoundly affected incipient or pre-existing ones. While America and China, powers at the core of the evolving system, sought to avoid incidents between their armed forces escalating to confrontations, their endorsement of, or support for, the actions of their clients within Asia-Pacific security complexes and, occasionally, their own participation in certain regional security complexes, lowered the bar for and raised the prospects of such escalation, with potentially combustible consequences.",

If the A-B linkage was more influential to both A and B in shaping both their mutual policies and policies towards the constellation\u2019s other components, then A-B could be described as a binary security complex. Sino-US relations can, as this study will demonstrate, reasonably be described as a binary security complex. While it has the most incendiary potential from a global security perspective, US and Chinese leaders have, until 2015, managed its evolution in a broadly non-violent fashion. The same cannot be said of their handling of other West Pacific security complexes. In a way, this trend recalls the Cold War era, when mutually deterred by the risk of catastrophic nuclear exchanges, rival superpowers transmitted their competitive impulses to peripheral actors waging proxy-conflicts. Key binary security complexes simmering across the wider Asia-Pacific region, aside from and around the core Sino-US dynamic, are China\u2013Japan, South Korea\u2013North Korea, and China\u2013India.",

When a third actor enters the fray, the binary complex precipitates a strategic triangle which, owing to the added complexity of permutations and combinations of antagonistic action and the increased probability of misperception and miscalculation, further complicates the management of mutual insecurity. While a handful of strategic triangles in the Asia-Pacific region are congruent, meaning their component actors are closely cooperative in pursuit of shared interests and consonant policies, most are competitive. The US\u2013Japan\u2013ROK, US\u2013Japan\u2013India, US\u2013Japan\u2013Australia and Japan\u2013Australia\u2013India relational dynamics exemplify congruent strategic triangles.

Given the still imposing, but not exclusive, locus of state-actors within the international system, the perspective informing this study is realist. But for the reasons explained above, especially the increasing import of state-non-state interactions, rising profile of multilateral institutions in addressing trans-border issues, and instances of voluntary if partial cession of state-sovereignty to pooled or collective sovereignty, as in alliances and coalitions, this work views Sino-US strategic competition and its systemic backdrop of transitional fluidity through a prism best described as pragmatic realism, an adaptation which, while acknowledging changes reshaping the global political-economic landscape, ascribes no normative attributes to the actors reviewed here.",

The Reagan Administration expanded America\u2019s defence-technological capabilities and reaped benefits from deepening clandestine Sino-US collaboration.

The PLA was developing capabilities to mount precision attacks on key nodes of America\u2019s forward- and proximally-deployed forces, installations, services and systems. Chinese conventional ballistic missiles with submunition-warheads and improved guidance systems attaining circular-error-probability of less than 50 m could strike US and allied airfields and aircraft in Okinawa, elsewhere in Japan, and South Korea, eroding air-cover for US operations [21]. This would lay other US assets open to Chinese air- or missile attacks. PLA cruise missiles, aircraft carrying precision-guided munitions (PGMs), or special operations forces (SOF) could destroy US command facilities and satellite ground stations, severing terrestrial communications. High-energy lasers and kinetic-energy anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, both recently tested, could disrupt US surveillance and reconnaissance satellites. PLA jammers could render US early-warning (EW) radars ineffective while long-range surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles attacked EW aircraft.

The cost-benefit calculations of great powers and secondary actors, proportional to the capacity to pursue their interests, differed significantly. Calculations varied even more depending on whether the system was unipolar, bipolar, multipolar or in a state of transition between two orders, with systemic equilibrium eroded. Power in a unipolar system is so overwhelmingly concentrated in hegemonic hands that the distinction between secondary powers\u2019 threat perceptions and the threat inherent in the power of primacy is often blurred. Distance, the differences between offensive and defensive stances, and intentions no longer moderate the threat\u2019s existential nature from the percipient\u2019s perspective [35]. Dramatic power differentials separating the hegemon and other players mean the latter \u2018must worry primarily about the hegemon\u2019s capabilities rather than its intentions\u2019 [36]. Even if hegemonic America was benign, the potency of its lethal capabilities rendered its benevolent reassurances questionable. In a unipolar system, \u2018the burden of proof is on the hegemon to demonstrate to others that its power is not threatening\u2019 [37]. For a perennially fire-fighting system-manager, using hard-power as the key tool of primacy to maintain order in an inherently disorderly milieu driven by the \u2018selfish in a self-help world\u2019 [38], this was a constant, possibly lost, struggle.",

According to one study, \u2018the fact that China\u2019s global impact and ranking has been increasing rapidly in recent years and that the U.S. is experiencing serious difficulties domestically is itself producing particular sensitivities and uncertainty\u2019 [48].

Dozens of bilateral fora for negotiating a spectrum of Sino-US differences notwithstanding, mutual distrust founded on and expressed in three related strands, persisted:Fundamentally different political traditions, value systems and cultures divided the polities. Washington negatively viewed China\u2019s authoritarian regime, its human rights violations and political opacity; Beijing saw US stances and action as consistently hostile and aimed at undermining its authority and legitimacy. In that context, rival national security- and intelligence organs worked on the premise that Sino-US relations were unfriendly, and their work deepened distrust.Washington and Beijing also suffered from an inadequate understanding of each other\u2019s policy-making processes and systems, and the relations between respective governments and other entities. What may be uncoordinated action initiated by disparate groups in one country was often seen by the other as well-planned and deliberate stratagems designed to pursue zero-sum gains. Beijing particularly identified actions of American NGOs and activists with Washington, especially the CIA.The perceived narrowing US\u2013China power gap, seen with concern in America and optimistic anticipation in China- deepened strategic distrust.

If he was incapable but did not realise this and appointed sycophants or relatives, then he would \u2018be endangered and encroached upon, and, in the extreme case, annihilated\u2019 [77]. Whereas most societies had able persons ready to serve the king as his prime minister, the ability to find, select and appoint them depended on the king. Those who followed the \u2018Way\u2019, survived and rose to greatness; those who did not were destroyed [78]. Sun Zi also noted that only a sage could be a \u2018true king\u2019 and rule an empire [79]. This relationship between the ruler and his domain also applied to wider\u2014for instance, global\u2014exercise of power [80]. Sun Zi classified rulers on the bases of two attributes\u2014mores and ethics, and power and strength. A \u2018True King\u2019 displayed strong mores and ethics and although usually had strong power, it was possible for a True King to have some weaknesses in power. Subjects voluntarily submitted to a true king. A hegemon displayed fairness and honesty in mores and ethics, and exercised strong power.

Its main text, also called the Mozi, classified the application of force by states in monist terms. Mo Di\u2019s followers, the Mohists, became a well-organised order with influential networks across much of China. However, after the fall of the Qin dynasty in 206BCE, Mohists lost their influence and organisational cohesion, and whole chapters of the Mozi texts were either lost or corrupted. Only in modern times has most of the Mozi been rediscovered, collected, translated and analysed. The Mozi distinguished between two kinds of warfare, Zhu- combat against unjust aggressors, and Gong-war of expansion and aggression. Mo Di and Mohists opposed Gong and supported those waging Zhu [85]. Mohists also propagated an additional concept\u2014jian\u2019ai, or universal love, bereft of which robbers robbed others, and kings invaded other kingdoms. Mo Di said, \u2018\u2026regard the state of others as one\u2019s own, the houses of others as one\u2019s own, the persons of others as one\u2019s self.

In 81BCE, for instance, Emperor Zhao of Han summoned more than 60 scholars from around the land for a 2-day policy-review with cabinet ministers. Key economic decisions on wartime taxation and monopolies as well as military and diplomatic policies were debated. The record of these exchanges, Discourses on Salt and Iron, became a key contribution to Chinese statecraft. While a senior minister urged the use of superior force against weaker neighbouring powers to achieve inexpensive but beneficial expansion, scholars argued that military expansion was often short-sighted, cost a lot but brought little profit, increased domestic burdens and could cause state-collapse. They advised that \u2018Broad virtue will bring distant people to come and follow\u2019 [88]. By contrasting a powerful force capable of expanding territory with \u2018broad virtue\u2019 which brought \u2018distant countries to submit\u2019, the cognoscenti offered an alternative paradigm of \u2018expansion by submission\u2019 [89].

While examinations of historical experience enriched China\u2019s intellectual capital, deepened understanding of the complexity of the polity\u2019s past, and perhaps helped China gain international respect for the rich heritage bestowed by its antiquity, such exercises made limited contributions to China\u2019s ability to manage and respond to more contemporary issues and challenges.

DoD\u2019s MDA confirmed in 2012 the details of the US\u2013Japan SM-3 Cooperative Development Programme designed to upgrade the system with the 21-in. diameter SM-3 Block IIA missiles aiming \u2018to defeat longer range ballistic missiles\u2019 [104]. Although Japan\u2019s BMD was ostensibly aimed at North Korean missiles, a completed SM-3 Block IIA system would be effective against all long-range missiles, including Chinese ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) comprising Beijing\u2019s strategic deterrent. Chinese commentary, describing US missile-defence programmes as destabilising, reflected profound angst. In 2001, shortly before Washington abrogated the ABM Treaty, Sha Zukang, head of China\u2019s Arms Control and Disarmament Department, said, the US National Missile Defence (NMD) programme wouldnot only undermine global strategic balance and stability, but also disrupt efforts for security in the Asia-Pacific region. Moreover, the US also intends to deploy Theatre Missile Defense (TMD) in the region. Research and development of TMD per se may not necessarily constitute a violation of the ABM Treaty. But, the crucial question is how large is the scale and what are the nature and function of TMD that the U.S. is prepared to deploy in Asia. If this TMD can be used as part of NMD and constitute the front deployment of NMD in the region, then its adverse impact on regional security and stability will be no less than the NMD itself [105].\n",
