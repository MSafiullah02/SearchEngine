            "text": "To date, natural outbreaks of EVD have only been recorded in central and west African countries. Before the outbreak of EVD in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia from 2013 to 2015, outbreaks of the disease were limited to secluded and rural locations in central Africa [29]. A cumulative 31,139 cases with 12,890 deaths have been recorded since the first recognition of EVD in 1976\u20132015, more than 90% of these cases were reported during the West Africa outbreak [30, 31]. Single exported cases during outbreaks have been recorded in travellers with secondary transmission noted during four such events in South Africa, Nigeria, USA and Mali [29]. The common perception is that children are spared during EVD outbreaks, and in fact this observation was made during several outbreak investigations [32]. This does however not mean that children are not affected. A retrospective study revealed that 20 of the 218 (9%) confirmed EVD cases during the 2000 Gulu, Uganda outbreak were in young children and adolescents [33]. Nearly 20% of the cases reported during the West Africa outbreak involved children below the age of 15 [34]. The putative index case of the West Africa outbreak was a 2 year old child that may have had exposure to bats whilst playing in the forest nearby his home [35, 36]. The risk of EVD in children may be related to cultural factors in handling and caring for ill persons within households. In communities where children are kept away from the sick the risk should be lower, but in many instances young children are co-admitted to hospital with their sick caregivers increasing the risk of them also being infected [33]. During the Gulu-outbreak, it was noted that the under-five age group was more affected during this outbreak than other children. Here children were typically co-admitted to hospital with their symptomatic parents [33].",

Evidence is accumulating that certain forest dwelling fruit bat species (including Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, Myonycteris torquata and possibly Eidolon helvum) are natural reservoirs of the virus although this occurrence is still not fully understood [37\u201339]. The source of EVD outbreaks has often been associated with direct contact with bushmeat [40]. The latter includes bats, chimpanzee, gorillas and duiker antelope [41]. The risk for contact with bushmeat appears to be related to slaughtering and preparation of the raw meat and not necessarily the consumption of cooked meat [41]. Outbreaks of EVD in the human population are amplified by human-to-human transmission through close and direct contact with infected individuals [23]. These outbreaks are perpetuated in the hospital setting but also in close family and friend circles where caring for the ill and traditional burial practices are the most prominent risk factor for contracting the virus.",

            "text": "The initial stage of the clinical course of EVD is non-specific, complicating early diagnosis, and follows an incubation period of 2\u201321 days [42]. The difficulty of clinical diagnosis is compounded by a long list of possible differential diagnoses in the locations where EVD has been described. This includes other VHF such as Lassa fever, but also other infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera and typhoid [42\u201345]. EVD is characterized by sudden onset of fever (>40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F)), generalized weakness and anorexia, myalgia, headache and sore throat [42, 46, 47]. These were all common findings in children during the EVD outbreak in West Africa [34]. Noteworthy, is that all of the EVD cases reported in children during the 2000 Gulu outbreak reported fever [33]. Patients infected with EVD rapidly deteriorate and commonly present with gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration. Chertow et al. [48] reported profuse watery diarrhea in EVD patients persisting for a week or more. As with other VHF, and contrary to the naming of the syndrome, most cases do not present with overt bleeding [33, 34, 42, 48]. Less than 20% of children diagnosed with EVD presented with bleeding which was reported as hematochezia, hematemesis, bleeding gums, epistaxis and oozing from needle puncture sites [33, 34]. Patients will then either recover or deteriorate, often displaying neurological signs. Patients typically succumb due to multi-organ failure and hypovolemic shock [42]. Common findings in EVD patients with a poor prognosis are rapidly developing leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and a decrease in coagulopathy markers [42, 49, 50].",

            "text": "Limited capacity for specialized laboratory diagnosis exists in most countries where EVD has been previously reported. This remains one of the biggest challenges in effective outbreak responses for the future [54, 55]. Laboratory investigations are typically carried out by national reference centres and involve specialized testing to detect the virus, or the body\u2019s response to the infection [24, 54, 56]. Specific laboratory confirmation is by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR which detects the viral RNA in a patient\u2019s sample. Antigen detection using enzyme immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are also commonly used. Live virus may also be isolated in cell culture, but typically serves as a complimentary assay and due to the time required for results, not always useful for diagnosis or a timely outbreak response. Detection of specific IgM responses or rise in specific IgG titre is also indicative of recent infection. The latter is tested using indirect immunofluorescence assays or ELISA. Some laboratories may offer additional testing such as electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry on tissue samples, but this may be viewed as complimentary testing in most cases. It is recommended that blood and tissues of suspected EVD cases be handled in biosafety level 4 facilities; although RT-PCR testing during the West Africa EVD outbreak was done under field conditions working under modified biosafety level 3 conditions. The West Africa outbreak has highlighted the need for rapid and sensitive tests for EVD. Tests that can be conducted at facility level or at the bedside will be helpful in directing clinical decisions [55, 57]. Although testing at reference laboratories may be laborious and more time consuming than facility-level testing, it is still recommended that all investigations be confirmed by experienced reference laboratories. Several rapid EVD assays are being developed in response to the West Africa outbreak, but are not yet widely available [58\u201363].",

Fever and pain is managed with paracetamol and it is recommended to avoid nonsteroidal antipyretics [12]. Chertow et al.

Antimalarial treatment is recommended for all suspected EVD cases, and malaria testing is recommended to guide further actions [12]. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics is recommended especially in children, aged less than 5 years [12] as empiric treatment for possible bacterial sepsis. Fluid replacement will be required in many EVD patients and blood transfusions, in those with bleeding, may be beneficial [12].",

This was followed by an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 and 2014, also affecting nearly 70% of the population [103\u2013106]. The virus continued to spread westward, and was reported in Chile\u2019s Easter Island in February 2014 [107]. This was followed by detection of the virus in Brazil in May 2015, although molecular studies have suggested that the virus may have been introduced as early as late 2014 [108\u2013110]. By September 2016, ZIKV was reported from more than 47 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean [111]. In addition, probably related to increased vigilance for the virus, outbreaks of the disease have been reported from Micronesia, Western Samoa, Figi, Singapore, Tonga, Samoa and the Marshal Islands, with possible endemic transmission reported in a dozen other countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific since 2015 [111]. Although, these reports may relate to endemic occurrence of the virus, the possibility of autochthonous outbreaks due to translocation of virus from Latin America is under investigation for some of these outbreaks [111].",

The role of other mosquito species in transmission of the virus to humans is disputed [113\u2013121]. Aedes mosquitoes usually thrive during warm and wet seasons in the tropics and subtropics, with Aedes aegypti particularly well suited for breeding in urban settings, hence the risk of transmission of the virus from infected mosquitos to humans. Although, direct mosquito transmission is mostly implicated in transmission of the ZIKV to humans, transmission in-utero, intrapartum and through sexual transmission has been reported [111, 122\u2013133]. Transmission in-utero has been most alarming with the probable link to congenital malformations and microcephaly (see Sect. 5.2.2). Rare cases of transmission through blood transfusion and laboratory exposures have also been reported [105, 134].",

As such, current opinion is that ZIKV infection during pregnancy can be linked to microcephaly and other congenital neurological and developmental abnormalities, although Koch\u2019s postulates have not been applied to prove causality [155]. Reports of neonates with microcephaly and other malformations and abnormalities are accumulating since early 2016 [125, 130, 131, 156\u2013158]. In conjunction with microcephaly, small brain size, ventriculomegaly, hypoplasia or agyria, agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, posterior fossa abnormalities and calcifications have been reported [125, 131, 156, 157]. Other abnormalities have included growth retardation, arthogryposis and ophthalmologic findings [125, 130\u2013132, 156, 157, 159]. Fetal losses have also been reported, and a perinatal mortality rate of almost 27% was reported by Oliveira and co-workers [130, 131] in a small cohort study conducted in Brazil. Continued longitudinal monitoring of the development of the birth cohort affected by the ZIKV outbreak will reveal the breadth of neurological damage possibly caused by the virus [160]. A retrospective study has indicated cases of microcephaly and other abnormalities in babies born during the ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia [161]. The possible link between these cases and ZIKV infection was not made at the time, most likely due to the limited number of cases involved (i.e. the extent of the outbreak in Brazil and South America allowed for the possible correlation to be made).",

A wide range of non-specific prodromal features including fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and change in mood and itching at the initial rabies exposure site may be reported, and in the absence of a report of possible exposure to rabies the disease is difficult to diagnose clinically [186].",

Paralytic rabies is less common and more difficult to recognize as rabies. Neurological sign include quadriparesis which predominantly involves the proximal muscles, loss of reflexes and paralysis.

The differential diagnosis includes other viral causes of encephalitis and bacterial meningitis and cerebral malaria [182, 186]. Tetanus is important in the differential diagnosis and may also be linked to the same animal source, typically there is a short incubation period and the muscle rigidity is constant, without relaxation between spasms. Paralytic rabies can also be confused with poliomyelitis and Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome [204, 205]. Drug intoxications, psychiatric disorders also form part of the differential diagnosis.",

The latter should be complimented by promotion of responsible animal ownership and bite prevention programmes. Ensuring the availability and accessibility of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for potentially exposed humans is key in the prevention of human rabies. Rabies PEP is highly effective in preventing rabies in persons exposed to RABV provided timeous administration of biologicals and recommended regimens are followed [8]. True failures of PEP are very rare [215, 216]. Modern rabies vaccines are highly purified, cell-derived inactivated vaccines with agreeable safety profiles, very few adverse reactions and are highly immunogenic [8]. Wound cleaning and PEP, done as soon as possible after suspected contact with a rabid animal can prevent the onset of rabies in virtually 100% of exposures. Intensive wound cleaning is a critical, affordable and manageable component of rabies prevention especially in communities without access to rabies biological prevention and may play some role in some cases in preventing progression to rabies disease. Management of the wound includes cleaning with copious amounts of water (even for small wounds) and soap. The wound should be disinfected with 70% ethanol and iodine. Wound management should also include the use of antibiotics and provision of tetanus vaccination/booster vaccination as clinically required.",

Even if there is a delay between exposure and visit to the healthcare facility, there is no cut off point after which it is too late to initiate rabies PEP. The decision to give PEP or not should also be made on the risk of RABV transmission, for example taking into account: the animal species, provoked versus unprovoked attack, animal behavior, animal health and category of exposure and history of rabies vaccination of the animal if possible and reliable. Vaccination is either through the intramuscular or intradermal route in accordance with WHO recommended regimens [8]. In wounds that drew any amount of blood (including small wounds such as scrapes that broke the skin) (also called category III exposures), rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) is essential. The latter provides passive immunity whilst immunity is mounted against the rabies vaccination. The use of RIG is crucial in prevention of rabies in category III exposures and failure to provide has culminated in prophylaxis failures [217]. Human or equine-derived rabies immunoglobulins are highly effective and generally safe to use [8]. It should be noted that the use of equine derived immunoglobulin should be used in facilities that are able to manage potential severe allergic reactions [8]. The RIG is infiltrated locally into wound site as much as possible. If injection locally into wound is painful, particularly in children; especially if the wound is on the head, face or neck, consider some sedation provided it can be done safely. The costs of RIG, and limited access and availability in many developing countries, limit the success of PEP in developing countries.",

Pre-exposure regimens using cell-derived vaccines either administered intradermally or intramascularly as three doses have been shown to induce good immune responses, which are long lasting and successfully boosted even after many years if there is specific exposure [8]. Pre-exposure vaccination obviates the need for post exposure rabies immunoglobulin, a generally scarce resource in many areas. The use of pre-exposure vaccines as part of the expanded program for immunization has been used in some areas with high exposure risks and shown to be immunogenic and safe, with persistence of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies [221\u2013223].",
