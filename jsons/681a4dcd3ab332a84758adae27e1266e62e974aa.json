In addition, steroid-induced avascular necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH) frequently occurs in young and middle-aged people, and is associated with a high risk of disability since it involves bilateral femoral heads.

Autophagy is an auto-catabolic recycling process of eukaryotic cells that is frequently dysregulated in cancer, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, aging, etc [7] [8] [9] [10] . Our preliminary results show that SANFH is associated with autophagy, and the autophagyrelated Beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1LC3) are upregulated in osteoblasts 11 . Primary cilia are sensitive cellular antennae that sense and transmit external signals 12 , and coordinate the responsive mechanisms 13 . Recent studies show that the formation of primary cilia depends on autophagy 14 . The intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20) protein which regulates ciliary formation and length 15, 16 is upregulated during starvation or lysosomal inhibition, and its knockdown during autophagy inhibits cilia formation 17 . IFT20 also recruits non-ciliary proteins to the plasma membrane, which is the site of autophagosome formation. Furthermore, autophagy is significantly decreased when ciliary formation is disrupted, which is the basis of ciliated disease 18 . The oral facial digital syndrome-1 (OFD1) is a centrosome satellite protein that suppresses cilia formation, and its autophagic degradation promotes the biosynthesis of primary cilia 19, 20 .",

Lane et al. found that glucocorticoids increase the gap between osteocytes, which results in the loss of minerals and disrupts bone metabolism independent of apoptosis 23 . Xia et al. first reported that dexamethasone increased autophagy in osteoblasts, which was verified in the primary osteoblasts isolated from prednisolone-treated mice 24 . In the current study, we detected increased Beclin 1 expression in the femoral head tissues of a rabbit model of SANFH, indicating that autophagy is also a pathological basis of SANFH. This is consistent with a previous study which showed that inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA retarded SANFH development in vivo 25 . Under physiological conditions with functioning osteoblasts, necrosis of the femoral head is repaired naturally. Therefore, glucocorticoids likely inhibit osteoblast function to aggravate SANFH. Luo et al. reported that Methylprednisolone increased autophagy in bone cells in a model of SANFH in a dosedependent manner, which also affects the interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts 6 .

This is consistent with the study of Tang et al., which showed that autophagy promoted cilia formation through selective degradation of OFD1. While LC3 specifically targeted OFD1 to the autophagy corpuscles for degradation, its centrosomal and basal parts were retained 28 . Pampliega et al. found that IFT20 was necessary for cilia formation and assembly, and was also degraded by autophagy to inhibit ciliation 29 . Taking both studies together, selective elimination of IFT20 during cell growth and proliferation hinders cilia formation while degradation of OFD1 during growth arrest promotes cilia formation. In this study, glucocorticoids gradually upregulated OFD1 and decreased IFT20 in the osteoblasts. We concluded, therefore, that glucocorticoids block the signal transduction of osteoblasts by selectively eliminating IFT20 during cell growth and proliferation.",
