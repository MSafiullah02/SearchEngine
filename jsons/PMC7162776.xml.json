This action can lead to negative psychological consequences among college students. For example, college students often experience compounded negative emotions during the school \u201cclosure\u201d (Van Bortel, 2016). Some students who find the campus homelike and welcoming harbor intense feelings such as frustration, anxiety, and betrayal. Some may struggle with loneliness and isolation while sheltering in place because of disconnections from friends and partners. For those who receive counselling services on campus, they can no longer access counselling services, which exacerbates their psychological symptoms and increase some students\u2019 risk for suicide and substance abuse.",

As more universities transitioning to remote learning after the spring break, some students suffer from poor mental health due to the disruption of academic routine (Agnew et al., 2019). Many students have to cease their research projects and internships when universities evacuated them from campus. Moreover, disruptions of their research projects and internships jeopardize their program of study, delay their graduation, and undermine their competitiveness on the job market, which in turn fuels anxiety among college students. They may also struggle with the cost of returning home and managing belongings.",

They also have concerns and fears of infection and transmission of COVID-19 to their family members when they return home. Given that youth can be asymptomatic carriers (Pan et al., 2020), students may be worried about putting their elder family members at increased risk for infection with severe complications from COVID-19. The fact that the COVID-19 pandemic affects collegiate mental health only underscores the urgent need to understand these challenges and concerns in order to inform the development of courses of action and public health messaging that will support college students during this difficult time.",

During the pandemic, the courses of action implemented by universities significantly affect students\u2019 mental health and wellbeing. It is commendable that many universities have responded promptly to the unprecedented situation. They flipped the switch and focused on remote education instead of in-person classes. Although this transition can lead to acute stress among some students due to the lack of time for adjustment, remote learning allows college students to sustain their academic routine which is found to benefit mental health and psychological resilience in the long run (Drake and Whitley, 2014). In addition, college students may experience less anxiety because remote learning helps them continue to manage their academic routine on a regular basis (Wang et al., 2020).",

This decision can also relieve students\u2019 financial hardship by reducing the cost of travel.

First, in addition to remote education, student advising should continue and transition to telecommunication (e.g., phone call, online meeting) in order to provide academic support for students. Faculty and staff should consider offering virtual office hours to students, and they need to work together to maintain the connection and help students process and address academic concerns caused by the disruption of the semester. Second, for students whose internships or research projects were affected by the pandemic, internship site supervisors and research advisors should actively engage in helping students seek alternative plans, enabling them to work from home to maximize internship and research experiences. Third, universities should work on innovative methods to support students to move research projects and capstones forward so that students can fulfil graduation requirements; meanwhile, university career centers should switch to virtue services, continuing to facilitate career development for college students.",

University counselling centers can also provide options for students to join online support groups that enable them to share common concerns and receive social support (Rollman et al., 2018). Further, university counselling centers and other departments should rally to develop and pass public health messaging onto students, sharing coping resources, and encouraging them to take action to protect their mental health.",
