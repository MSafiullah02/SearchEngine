We show that the joint reconstruction with community detection has a synergistic effect, where the edge correlations used to inform the existence of communities are also inherently used to improve the accuracy of the reconstruction which, in turn, can better inform the uncovering of communities. We illustrate the use of our method with observations arising from epidemic models and the Ising model, both on synthetic and empirical networks, as well as on data containing only functional information.",

However, in many cases, these interactions are hidden from us, either because they are impossible to measure directly, or because their measurement can be done only at significant experimental cost. Examples include the mechanisms of gene and metabolic regulation [1] , brain connectivity [2] , the spread of epidemics [3] , systemic risk in financial institutions [4] , and influence in social media [5] . In such situations, we are required to infer the network of interactions from the observed functional behavior. Researchers have approached this reconstruction task from a variety of angles, resulting in many different methods, including thresholding the correlation between time series [6] , inversion of deterministic dynamics [7] [8] [9] , statistical inference of graphical models [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and of models of epidemic spreading [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , as well as approaches that avoid explicit modeling, such as those based on transfer entropy [21] , Granger causality [22] , compressed sensing [23] [24] [25] , generalized linearization [26] , and matching of pairwise correlations [27, 28] .",

First, we employ a nonparametric Bayesian formulation of the problem, which yields a full posterior distribution of possible networks that are compatible with the observed dynamical behavior. Second, we perform network reconstruction jointly with community detection [29] , where, at the same time as we infer the edges of the underlying network, we also infer its modular structure [30] . As we will show, while network reconstruction and community detection are desirable goals on their own, joining these two tasks has a synergistic effect, whereby the detection of communities significantly increases the accuracy of the reconstruction, which in turn improves the discovery of the communities, when compared to performing these tasks in isolation.",

The latent conditional probabilities of edges existing between groups of nodes is learned by the collective observation of many similar edges, and these correlations are leveraged to extrapolate the existence of missing or spurious ones. The same mechanism is expected to aid the reconstruction task, where edges are not observed directly, but the observed functional behavior yields a posterior distribution on them, allowing the same kind of correlations to be used as an additional source of evidence for the reconstruction, going beyond what the dynamics alone says.",

The quality of the reconstruction peaks at the critical threshold for each model, at which the sensitivity to perturbations is the largest. As the number of observed samples increases, so does the quality of the reconstruction, and the relative advantage of the joint reconstruction diminishes, as the data eventually \"washes out\" the contribution from the prior. For the Ising model, we compare the results of our method with the mean-field inverse correlations method [14] , i.e., \u03b2A ij J ij \u00bc \u00bdC \u22121 ij , where C ij \u00bc h\u03c3 i \u03c3 j i \u2212 h\u03c3 i ih\u03c3 j i is the connected correlation matrix. As seen in Fig. 2 , this simpler reconstruction method can be just as accurate as our separate reconstruction approach, but only close to the critical point. For higher inverse temperatures, the reconstruction deteriorates rapidly and breaks down completely as the system becomes locally magnetized, with whole rows and columns of the matrix C being equal to zero, causing it to be singular [48] . In such situations, this kind of approach requires explicit regularization techniques [49] , which become unnecessary with our Bayesian method. The joint inference with community structure improves the reconstruction even further, beyond what is obtainable with typical inverse Ising methods, since it incorporates a different source of evidence. In Fig. 3 , we show a comparison of the reconstruction of the food web network from a simulated Ising model, using different approaches. Optimal thresholding corresponds to the naive approach of imputing the existence of an edge to the connected correlation between two nodes exceeding a threshold c \u00c3 , i.e., \u03c0 ij \u00bc f1 if C ij > c \u00c3 ; 0; otherwiseg. The value of c \u00c3 was chosen to maximize the posterior similarity, which represents the best possible reconstruction achievable with this method. Nevertheless, the network thus obtained is severely distorted. The inverse correlation method comes much closer to the true network, but is superseded by the joint inference with community detection.",

The method is nonparametric and, hence, requires no prior stipulation of aspects of the network and size of the model, such as number of groups. By leveraging inferred correlations between edges, the SBM includes an additional source of evidence and, thereby, improves the reconstruction accuracy, which in turn also increases the accuracy of the inferred communities. The overall approach is general, requiring only appropriate functional model specifications, and can be coupled with an open ended variety of such models other than those considered here.

The text labels show the dominating country membership for the users in each group.",
