            "text": "The transmembrane metalloprotease aminopeptidase-N (APN)/CD13 is overexpressed in various solid and hematological malignancies in humans, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is thought to influence tumor progression. Here, we investigated the contribution of APN/CD13 to the regulation of growth and survival processes in AML cells in vitro. Anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies MY7 and SJ1D1 (which do not inhibit APN activity) and WM15 (an APN-blocking antibody) inhibited the growth of the AML cell line U937 and induced apoptosis, as evidenced by cell accumulation in the sub-G 1 phase, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. Isotype-matched IgG1 and the APN/CD13 enzymatic inhibitors bestatin and 2,3-dinitroflavone-8-acetic acid, were ineffective. Internalization of CD13-MY7 complex into cells was followed by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 down-regulation, Bax up-regulation, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP-1. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and the caspase-9-and caspase-8-specific inhibitors significantly attenuated apoptosis. CD13 ligation also induced apoptosis and PARP-1 cleavage in primary AML blasts, whereas normal blood cells were not affected. Overall, these data provide new evidence that CD13 can serve as a target for inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis in AML (independently of its APN activity). These findings may have implications for tumor biology and treatment.-Piedfer, M., Dauzonne, D., Tang, R., NGuyen, J., Billard, C., Bauvois, B.

Furthermore, CD13's enzymatic activity modulates the responses of bioactive peptides (e.g., vasoactive peptides, neuropeptides, and chemokines; ref. 1). The CD13 protein is also a receptor for coronaviruses (1) . Several natural and synthetic APN inhibitors have been characterized and used to reveal that CD13 can influence major biological processes, including cell growth and invasion and angiogenesis in various cellular systems (1) (2) (3) . CD13's involvement in these processes has mostly been confirmed by blockage with anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; refs. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have yet to be described in detail. Indeed, it is not clear whether APN enzymatic activity is required for CD13's other functions. Some researchers have suggested that signal transduction accounts for some of CD13's functions (10 -12) . With regard to apoptosis, the presence of CD13 correlates with neutrophil resistance to TNF-\u2423induced apoptosis via reduced shedding of TNF-receptor I (13) . Although studies with APN inhibitors have indicated a potential role for CD13 in apoptosis, this effect remains controversial because high doses of the inhibitors used might induce cytotoxicity in a nonspecific manner (1, 12) .",

Cell growth was markedly reduced in anti-CD13 mAb-treated samples, when compared with isotype-matched IgG1, vehicle, or no treatment ( Fig. 2A) .

Kinetic studies revealed a time-dependent, inhibitory effect of anti-CD13 mAbs on U937 cell growth (Fig. 2B) . Cell growth arrest was accompanied by reduction in DNA content to sub-G 1 levels ( Fig. 2C for MY7 ; data not shown for SJ1D1 and WM15) and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2D ) characteristic of apoptosis. Moreover, the average diameter of dead cells (\u05459 m) was smaller than that of living cells. Apoptosis was further confirmed by phosphatidylser-ine exposure at the cell surface, with consequential annexin V-FITC binding. Indeed, annexin-V binding was higher in anti-CD13 mAb-treated cells than in untreated cells or those treated with IgG1, anti-TACE, or vehicle (Fig. 3A) .

Cells were incubated with MY7 (20 g/ml) for 6 and 18 h at 37\u00b0C. As seen in Fig. 5Ac , surface CD13 levels fell over time on MY7-treated cells but did not change on untreated cells (Fig. 5Aa) and IgG1-treated cells (Fig. 5Ab) . Accordingly, the surface APN activity of U937 cells was specifically decreased by stimulation with MY7 (Fig. 5B) . No significant differences in intracellular CD13 staining were observed for untreated cells and IgG1-and MY7-treated cells (data not shown). In parallel, enzymatic assays on culture medium from untreated cells and IgG1-and MY7-treated cells were performed (i.e., to check that surface CD13 downregulation did not result from shedding into the culture medium). Nonstimulated cells released low levels of soluble APN (\u03fd10% of the total APN activity in intact cells; Fig. 5C ). When U937 cells were activated with PMA (i.e., a positive control), surface CD13 expression and activity rose (Fig. 5A, B) . This increase was accompanied by the release of soluble APN (with a significant, 5.7-fold enhancement at 18 h; Fig. 5C ). In contrast, the APN activity released from MY7-treated cells did not vary over time, when compared with untreated and IgG1-treated cells (Fig. 5C) . These findings indicate that CD13 down-regulation by MY7 likely results from cell internalization of CD13-MY7 complexes.",

To establish whether caspases 3, 8, and/or 9 are activated during anti-CD13 mAb-mediated apoptosis, we studied the ability of U937 cell lysates to cleave chromogenic substrates of these enzymes. Untreated U937 cells display similarly low baseline levels of all three caspase activities. Etoposide (1 M) was used as a positive control, since it triggers U937 cell death by activating these caspases (34, 35) (Fig. 7A) . Kinetic studies indicated that cell treatment with MY7 (35 g/ml) resulted in a time-dependent increase in all three caspase activities, relative to untreated cells (Fig. 7A) . Accordingly, Western blot analyses showed that exposure of U937 cells to MY7 induced the cleavage of the downstream caspase-3 substrate poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) (Fig. 7A ). To determine whether the initiator caspase in the extrinsic pathway (i.e., caspase-8) or the intrinsic pathway (i.e., caspase-9) is involved in the apoptotic action of MY7, we examined the effects of a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk) and selective inhibitors of caspase-8 (Z-IETD-fmk) and caspase-9 (Ac-LEHD-CHO) on cell viability. MY7-induced cell death was blocked markedly by Z-VAD-fmk (85% of inhibition) and to a lesser extent by Ac-LEHD-CHO (41% of inhibition) and Z-IETD-fmk (33% of inhibition) (Fig. 7B) . These results showed that MY7 induces caspase-dependent cell death through both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.",

MY7 and WM15 were obtained after immunization with blasts from AML patients (25, 40) , whereas SJ1D1 was raised against CD13 from the myeloid cell line KG1 (25) . The epitopes on CD13 bound by SJ1D1 and MY7 are very close together. The WM15 binding site overlaps that cooccupied by SJ1D1 (25) . In contrast to MY7 and SJ1D1, WM15 inhibits the APN activity of CD13 (25, 41) . In the present study, we showed that all anti-CD13 mAbs recognize similar levels of surface CD13 on the AML cell line U937 (FAB M5) and on M0-, M1-, M2-, M4-, and M5-subtype primary AML cells. Following anti-CD13 mAb treatment, U937 cells undergo growth arrest and then apoptosis (as evidenced by sub-G 1 cell-cycle accumulation, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization). The results in U937 cells were confirmed in primary AML cells (independently of the latter's FAB subtype), with MY7-mediated apoptosis observed in 15 of the 21 AML samples tested. The APN-inhibiting WM15 mAb suppressed U937 cell growth to the same extent as the non-APN-inhibiting MY7 and SJ1D1 mAbs, suggesting that CD13's catalytic site is not involved in the inhibitory effect of anti-CD13 mAbs. Bestatin is the most frequently used CD13/APN inhibitor, although it does interact with other aminopeptidases, such as leucyl-aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) and aminopeptidase W (EC 3.4.11.16) in myeloid cells (1) . In this context, we had previously synthesized a series of novel flavone-8-acetic acid derivatives and selected DNFAA as an efficient APN inhibitor (18) . Bestatin and DNFAA are both slow-binding, competitive inhibitors of APN (1) . When used at a concentration of 100 M, which inhibits APN activity (30 -40 fold above the IC 50 values), bestatin and DNFAA did not alter cell growth and survival, implying that CD13's APN activity is not required for this process. It is noteworthy that higher doses of bestatin used in previous studies might inhibit other aminopeptidase activities (1, 42) . Inhibitory effects observed with high doses of bestatin (\u0546145 M) likely reflect bestatin intracellular effects (42) .",

The short intracellular intracytoplasmic tail of CD13 neither contains a death domain nor a conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif ITAM to directly couple CD13 to intracellular effectors for inducing a cascade of events leading to cell activation. This suggests that signaling induced by the CD13/anti-CD13 mAb complex could be mediated by the physical interaction with other signaling molecules. Two studies have shown that CD13 colocalizes with Fc\u2425RI/CD64 on monocytes (43, 44) . The receptors for the Fc portion of IgG are signaling molecules that require Syk activation. We found that isotype control IgG1 did not influence cell growth, surface CD64 was not affected by MY7 treatment, and the Syk inhibitor piceatannol did not block the proapoptotic effect of MY7. These results, therefore, indicate that Fc\u2425RI/CD64 does not potentiate MY7's effect on U937 cells. In U937 cells, the WM15 and SJ1D1 mAbs induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinases, and inhibitors of PI3K were able to decrease their phosphorylation (45) . Activated PI3K localizes to the plasma membrane and catalyzes the \u2425-phosphate transfer of ATP to phosphoinositides needed for phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3) generation and calcium signaling (46) . Free Ca 2\u03e9 is reported to induce mitochondrial Ca 2\u03e9 uptake, which can trigger mitochondrial membrane depolarization and release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins (47) . PIP3, in turn, activates downstream substrates, including the serine/threonine kinase AKT (46) . Our data obtained with the pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and AKT strongly suggest the implication of these kinases in the signaling cascade involved in MY7-mediated growth arrest. Anti-CD13 mAbs MY7, WM15, and Leu-M7 induced Ca 2\u03e9 release in monocytes and U937 cells (48, 49) . Furthermore, we investigated the signaling pathways involved in the proapoptotic activity of anti-CD13 mAbs.",

In the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, mitochondria may function as an amplifier by activating the downstream caspases 9 and 3 (33, 50) . In the present study, anti-CD13 mAb treatment dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential, activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cleaved PARP-1 (a major substrate of caspase-3) in U937 cells. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and the caspase-9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CHO significantly attenuated MY7mediated apoptosis, suggesting that anti-CD13 mAb treatment leads (at least) to the activation of a mitochondrial (intrinsic) caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway. Members of Bcl-2 family are important regulators of the intrinsic pathway (51) . By modifying outer and inner mitochondrial membrane permeability, the Bcl-2 family (including proapoptotic Bad and Bax proteins and antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins) regulate cytochrome c release from mitochondria, caspase activation, and PARP-1 cleavage (33, 51) . Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein rescues U937 cells from apoptosis (52) . While Ser-136-phosphorylation of Bad protects AML cells from apoptosis (39, 53) , unphosphorylated Bad can favor apoptosis by sequestering Bcl-2 within the cytoplasm and thus preventing the latter from binding to Bax; in turn, this promotes cytochrome c release (53, 54) . Our data indicate that MY7 decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 levels and increased Bax levels. However, the fact that MY7 did not affect Ser-136-p-Bad levels means that Bad is unlikely to be involved in anti-CD13-mediated apoptosis. It remains to be seen whether the inhibition of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 by MY7 treatment is regulated at the transcriptional level or not.",

            "text": "In the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, triggering of death receptors (such as Fas antigen and TNF-R1) leads to strong caspase-8 activation. This bypasses mitochondria and leads directly to caspase-3 activation and then apoptosis (33, 50) . However, small amounts of caspase-8 (activated by stress-induced signals within the cell) can activate the intrinsic pathway by inducing the production of truncated Bid (tBid) via the proteolytic cleavage of Bid (55) . Following translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membranes, tBid stimulates efficient oligomerization of Bax and activates the intrinsic pathway (55, 56) . Our data indicate that MY7 increased caspase-8 activity in the absence of Bid cleavage and that the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-fmk, at least in part, attenuated cell death, suggesting that MY7 can also activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Caspase-8 activation may be related to the extrinsic pathway, with TNF-R and/or Fas antigen triggering. In the present study, very low amounts of TNF-\u2423 (\u054590 pg/ml/10 6 cells at 24 h) were detected in conditioned medium from U937 cells, and MY7 does not alter TNF-\u2423 levels (unpublished results). Moreover, cell surface expression of Fas was not significantly modified by MY7 treatment. These data strongly suggest that anti-CD13 mAb treatment does not trigger death receptors. It remains to be seen whether anti-CD13 mAb treatment interferes with granzyme B and perforin (which can process procaspase-8) (57, 58) .",

Hence, CD13 may be a proapoptotic target in this disease. Accordingly, a recent study showed that anti-CD13 mAb WM15 was able to induce apoptosis in the HuH7 and PLC/PRF/5 human liver cancer cell lines in vitro (59) . The anti-CD13 mAbs' ability to promote cell death might open up new interventional strategies in the treatment of CD13 \u03e9 tumors.",
