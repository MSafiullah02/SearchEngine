While the true incidence is not yet known, large case series from New York City have suggested that almost a quarter of hospitalized patients may require endotracheal intubation. 1, 2 The risk of spreading COVID-19 virus through aerosolizing procedures, such as intubation or extubation, is well documented. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] While the majority of reports and guidelines focus on intubation, many of these same risks apply to extubation. Coughing is common in patients immediately after extubation and may contribute to additional aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2, as seen in simulations for intubation performed by multiple groups. 4, 5 Additionally, while the use of Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) strategies post-extubation is largely recommended for non-COVID patients with ARDS, there is little guidance on how to balance the clinical benefit of these interventions with the documented risk of viral aerosolization associated with these modalities. 8, 9 Previous reports of safe extubation Guidelines for extubation of COVID-19 patients are inconsistent and not well defined. Evidence based standards for safe practice under these circumstances are yet to be established. Several publications have emerged recently specifically describing safer techniques and protocols for extubation. D'Silva and colleagues recommend that extubation take place in a negative pressure room, if possible.",

The authors aim to describe interventions that might be applied to resource limited environments, although these primarily focus on intubation. In keeping with other reports, the authors emphasize the provision of only the minimal amount of staff for both intubation and extubation, and the use of a plastic sheet to cover the patient entirely as a means of reducing droplet aerosolization. 12 Consensus guidelines for the management of the airway in patients with COVID-19 were jointly ",

            "text": "In order to reduce risk of staff exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during high-risk procedures, barrier hood devices have been proposed, with a mixed response in the literature. The first known hood was described as an \"Aerosol Box\" constructed of durable plexi-glass. This device was intended for use in low resource situations where PPE was not adequately available for healthcare workers involved in high risk procedures. 15 A hood of this type was evaluated by Canelli et al who concluded in a simulated intubation experiment that such a hood prevented the spread of aerosolized particles. 4 Results were similar in an experiment by Matava et al who performed essentially the same procedure. 16 Response to this experiment has been mixed, with some authors suggesting that restricted hand movements might result in safety hazards to the patient, as patients with COVID-19 often require rapid intubation, rescue breaths with a mask, and/or suctioning to obtain a clear view of the vocal cords. Other disadvantages of the durable plexi-glass hood device include that it requires meticulous decontamination, and might be difficult to transport from patient to patient in emergent situations. 17 Other groups have suggested the use of a simple plastic sheet covering the entire patient as a barrier protection in high risk airway procedures, which has the theoretical advantage of being cheap and easily replaceable. Decreased access to the patient in emergency settings makes this device less desirable. 12, 18 The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City was diagnosed on March 1. Shortly after, New York has quickly become the front line and the epicenter of the nation's fight against the disease. As of May 13 th , 2020, there have been approximately 351,535 cases in the state and 26,707 deaths. 19 Our center, an academic tertiary medical center in Brooklyn, New York adapted rapidly and opened 8 Intensive care units to meet the need of the surge in mechanically ventilated patients. As with the majority of the medical centers, we created protocols for safe intubation and extubation to mitigate the high risk of the virus spread.",

Traditional guidelines have been established for the non-COVID patient largely apply, with some centers recommending the following. 23 Patients should be optimized prior to an attempt at extubation, with closed endotracheal and protected orotracheal suctioning. While there is evidence that an appropriate cough effort is associated with decreased rates of re-intubation, excessive coughing should be prevented via pharmacologic means. 10, 13 An extended trial of pressure support ventilation, and/or an extended spontaneous breathing trial may be considered. 8, 14 In light of the risk to staff associated with re-intubation of COVID-19 patients, the traditionally accepted re-intubation rate of 5-30% may no longer apply. For this reason, it is recommended by several groups that extubation be delayed as long as is feasible, which must be balanced against the need for intensive care unit beds in the setting of a pandemic. 13 If possible, extubation should take place in a negative pressure room. 10, 13 In open spaces, HEPA filters should be used to prevent aerosolized viral particle spread .",

The group recommends a standard surgical face mask be placed on the patient as soon as possible following extubation. 13 Multiple hospital systems have published institutional protocols pertaining to the extubation of COVID-19 patients.
