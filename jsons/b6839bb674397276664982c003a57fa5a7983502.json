Results were as follows: median progression-free-survival 4,2 months, median overall survival 8,7 months, grade 3-4 toxicity 15.8% (main toxicity: anaemia). The authors concluded that \"metronomic oral vinorelbine is an active and well-tolerated single-drug chemotherapy regimen in metastatic NSCLC and is a manageable therapy in frail patients\". In 2017, we started to use this oral metronomic formulation with vinorelbine at the dose of 40 mg three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), continously. Here, we report our experience in 10 out of 36 treated patients during COVID19 pandemic. Before Coronavirus emergency, our protocol required that patients perform blood test and hospital visit every 4 weeks; after March 8 th 2020 (Prime Minister Decree-law, in Italy), we still had 10 patients in treatment with metronomic vinorelbine. So, we decided to avoid hospital visits to these patients following them by phone interviews according their needs. The patients performed blood tests at home by Oncological home-care institutions and the oncologist received laboratory reports by fax in order to confirm therapy without risk of haematological renal or liver toxicity. The drugs were delivered at home by volunteers or by patients' relatives. We did not record any grade 3 or 4 side effects in these 10 patients that carried on treatment regularly in this emergency period without need to postpone chemotherapy and avoiding frequent hospital visits. In conclusion, we think that this vinorelbine formulation may be a valuable option allowing to treat frail lung cancer patients during Covid19 era. No other author collaboration was requested for the idea or the manuscript preparation.",
