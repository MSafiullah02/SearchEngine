As they are difficult to isolate in conventional cell lines, diagnosis is usually made by the electron microscopical (EM) examination of faeces. Enzyme immunoassays (EIA) for detecting faecal AVs which may be group?J or AdF specific\" have been developed but their use so far has been limited, probably because of cost. Group-specific EIAs, although potentially able to detect all AV serotypes, would appear to be more efficient in diagnosing infections with AdF, rather than non-AdF, serotypes, probably because AdF strains are usually present in faeces in larger numbers than those commonly isolated in cell culture, e.g. types 1, 2 and 5'.

Such samples might represent dual infections where large amounts of group antigen present in the samples interferes in the 40141 EIA. This is theoretically possible as the 40/41 EIA uses a group-specific monoclonal capture antibody with the AdF specific detecting monoclonal component being peroxidase conjugated. Consequently, excessive group antigen, especially if present in a 'soluble' form from disintegrated virions or disrupted cells. might block all the binding sites. preventing attachment of complete AdF virions and yielding false-negative results. Varying amounts of 'soluble' in relation to virion-associated antigen between specimens might explain the wide range of absorbance values found and the poor correlation between EIA and particle concentration by EM.
