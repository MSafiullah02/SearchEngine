The following year Chanock and his co-workers isolated the same agent from children with pneumonia and renamed it respiratory syncytial (RS) virus from its ability to provoke large syncytia in tissue cultures. Gradually evidence has accumulated that RS virus is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in young children. Although respiratory syncytial virus has been provisionally classified with the myxoviruses, it does not grow in chick embryo and does not show haemagglutination or haemadsorption. Since the virus is very sensitive to freezing and does not survive long at room temperature cultures must be inoculated by the bedside. RS virus grows well on Hela or HEp II cell lines but less well on monkey-kidney. Three serotypes have been identified. FIG. 57 .

They differ from viruses by their large size, by a complex cycle involving multiplication by binary fission within cells and by their susceptibility to a number of antibiotics including tetracycline and penicillin. They may be propagated in mice, chick embryo and cultures of Hela cells or monkey-kidney cells. Chlamydia psittaci, the agent causing psittacosis, is widely distributed amongst birds and has already been demonstrated in nearly 100 species. In birds the infection is usually symptomless but may cause disease when conditions are unhygienic. The illness is very variable, taking the form of a gastro intestinal disturbance in adult birds but may present as a respiratory illness in young birds. Healthy birds may excrete chlamydiae for long periods. Man is occasionally infected by inhaling dust from dried excreta or feathers or by handling carcasses of infected birds. Chlamydia vary greatly in virulence for man and animals, those derived from parakeets and turkeys being more dangerous than those from pigeons and ducks. Budgerigars, dying from natural causes, do not appear to be an important source of psittacosis in Britain. Transmission from man to man is rare but well authenticated among hospital staff caring for patients with psittacosis. Chlamydiae are notoriously dangerous to handle in the laboratory and the greatest care must be taken with infected tissues. Infection in man may be subclinical or may produce a mild feverish illness resembling influenza or present as atypical pneumonia but fortunately the classical attack with fulminating pneumonia is rare. Before restrictions on the importation of parrots into the United Kingdom were removed in 1966 about 40 cases of psittacosis were reported each year; in 1972 the number had arisen to 156.

The causative organism was first identified as a rickettsia but was later classified separately as Coxiella burneti. It is a pleomorphic organism containing both DNA and RNA. Although morphologically indistinguishable from rickettsiae it differs in a number of important qualities. It is very resistant to drying and is sensitive to the antibiotic thiomycetin. It seldom causes rashes in man and does not stimulate the production of antibodies against the Proteus X strains as do the rickettsiae. During the Mediterranean campaign of 1944-45 this rickettsia-like organism was incriminated as the cause of atypical pneumonia occurring among soldiers in Italy and the Balkans. Subsequently localised outbreaks of Q fever have been identified in many parts of the world and infection has been found to be widespread in cattle, sheep, goats and other animals. In these farm animals infection is subclinical but large numbers of coxiellae are discharged in urine, faeces and milk and from the genital tract at parturition, resulting in heavy contamination of the environment. Infection usually spreads by inhalation of infected dust but may be acquired by drinking infected milk and in some parts of the world, notably Australia, may be transmitted from animal to animal by ticks. Coxiella burneti is a dangerous organism to culture and infection spreads readily in laboratories. Direct spread from man to man has been observed but is rare.",

Further peaks occur in November and December with acute illness in patients suffering from chronic bronchitis. A lull at Christmas is followed by a further rise in January, then a wave of colds and lower respiratory disease in March and April. The factors determining these seasonal fluctuations are little understood but there is correlation with low soil temperature and dry air in heated dwellings. Respiratory infections associated with enteroviruses occur during the summer whereas outbreaks due to respiratory syncytial virus are found in the winter. Rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses and reoviruses may be found throughout the year. Respiratory viruses have a world distribution and are as prevalent in the tropics as the temperate zones. They may even be found in remote oceanic islands though there is a tendency for rhinoviruses to disappear in such closed communities.

Antibodies to adenoviruses, types 1, 2 and 5, are formed early in life but antibodies to types 3, 4 and 7 appear later. Outbreaks of adenovirus infection in adults may occur in military camps but are rarely found in civilian life. Coxsackie A21 (Coe) virus produces respiratory disease in military recruits.

Although rhinoviruses are not shed readily from the upper respiratory tract on coughing or sneezing they may be found on the hands and fingers and can survive for up to three hours on non-porous surfaces. Virus can be transferred by infected fingers to the nasal or conjunctival mucosa. Rather surprisingly rhinoviruses do not survive on soiled handkerchiefs. Studies in Holland and the United States have shown that waves of colds arise simultaneously in different parts of the country. Since this can hardly result from person-to-person spread, some other explanation is necessary. It is conceivable that latent viruses in the respiratory tract are activated by changes in the weather or other factors. Colds are not highly infectious. It has been estimated that the chance of catching a cold from an infected relative is one in five and only about 10 per cent, of adults exposed to colds become infected. Respiratory viruses can be recovered from the upper air passages during the first few days of illness but quickly disappear with the onset of recovery.

As the mucosa swells, breathing through the nose becomes difficult and the senses of smell and hearing may be impaired.

In viral laryngitis the mucosa of the pharynx and the larynx is velvety and has a deep red colour. The main obstruc tion lies immediately below the vocal cords and is caused by inflammatory oedema of the mucous membrane aggravated by sticky mucopurulent exudate. Apart from stridor few signs are found on auscultation of the chest. Diphtheria should be considered in all patients with obstructive laryngitis (see Chapter 20).

Infection may spread from the larynx into the trachea and bronchi causing acute laryngotracheo-bronchitis.

Serological tests for influenza have been described elsewhere (Chapter 13). Adenovirus infection may be diagnosed by a com plement-fixation test using Hela cell antigens but neutralisation and HI tests are necessary to identify the strain. In parainfluenzal infection it is desirable to recover the virus because serological responses overlap with mumps virus. Complement-fixation and neutralisation tests may be used for respiratory syncytical infections but direct recovery of virus is more sensitive particularly in infants. Infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae may be suspected with positive cold agglutination or streptococcus MG tests but proof should be obtained by complementfixation or from antibodies detected by an immunofluorescent technique using frozen infected chick embryo lung.

Active immunisation using living or killed vaccines is still experimental but the multiplicity of viruses and the absence of cross immunity make success unlikely. Adenovirus vaccines, inactivated by formalin or heat, provoke antibodies against homologous serotypes and have been used in military camps where such infections are common but their use has been suspended pending further investigation of the oncogenic properties of the virus. Experiments with rhinovirus vaccines inactivated by formalin have shown that they prevent illness and shedding of virus but do not prevent subclinical infection. Antibodies persist for 12-18 months. Since immunity is type specific and there are over 100 serotypes mass immunisation is hardly practicable. In Britain the more serious forms of psittacosis-ornithosis may be effectively controlled by careful quarantine of parrots and parakeets.",
