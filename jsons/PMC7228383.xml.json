Around 60 convalescent patients (with an onset time of 6\u20107 weeks) in a ward in the Wuhan Tongji Hospital were tested for specific antibodies against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. All patients tested positive for the IgG against the virus, while 13 patients tested negative for immunoglobulin M (IgM), with the immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer being greater than the IgM titer (Table 1 and Figure 1). Meanwhile, the IgM and IgG titers in 10 convalescent patients were tested twice (1 week apart); both titers showed a decrease, with the IgG titer being greater than the IgM titer (Table 2 and Figure 1). In these patients, two consecutive SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA tests were negative and the chest computed tomography findings indicated improvement. Considering this, their antibody titers and consistent clinical manifestations suggested that antibody detection could act as an indicator of the stage of COVID\u201019 progression and that the antibodies in convalescent patients are not always maintained at a high level. The immune status fitted both, the clinical and general characteristics of the humoral response. In one report, while 38 patients in the acute phase of the infection tested positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, 31 (81.6%) of them tested negative for IgM and IgG in serological assays,\n4\n thereby demonstrating that these patients were in the early stages of infection, as both the antibody titers were relatively low (Supplemental table 1). COVID\u201019 patients will develop immunity after recovery; however, the persistence, attenuation, and duration of protection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 antibodies requires further investigation.\n5\n\n",
