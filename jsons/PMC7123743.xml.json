This led to a delay in securing adequate health care teams (especially doctors, nurses, public health experts) to effectively respond to the Ebola crisis. There was a lot of panic, fear and anxiety amongst health care workers, political leaders and the population, in general. During contact tracing, some people were difficult, evasive and downright hostile. They hid information and others preferred discrete follow-up. Stigmatization of both contacts and cases was a serious issue. Rumors, especially through the social media platforms travelled fast. There was community resistance due to ignorance in the spheres of religion and culture. For instance, in terms of religion, there was the tendency for some who suspected that they might have been contracted Ebola to make the churches or mosques the first port of call, while many traditionalists preferred to visit traditional medicine practitioners. Of course there were the rumors that the use of traditional medical potions had been used to treat persons infected with Ebola in certain communities. Undoubtedly, all these were anecdotes with hardly any evidential basis. If anything, they only made it difficult for public health authorities to contain the spread of the disease. ",

Firstly, Nigeria had a first-rate virology laboratory that is affiliated to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. This unit is equipped with the appropriate infrastructure and resources to diagnose a case of Ebola virus disease. Therefore, there was some level of preparedness.
