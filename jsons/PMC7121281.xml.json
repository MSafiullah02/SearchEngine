            "text": "The family Coronaviridae can be divided into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in significant economic losses, initially only seen in the European and Asian swine industries over the last three decades. Recently, however, PEDV was first reported in the USA in May 2013 in Iowa [1]. Since then, the virus has rapidly spread nationwide [2] and to other countries in North America, including Canada and Mexico. The PED epidemic in the USA, from April 2013 to present, has led to a substantial loss of piglets (more than 10 % of US swine population). Because of similar clinical and pathogenic features between PEDV and another Alphacoronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), or a Deltacoronavirus, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), differential laboratory tests are required for their diagnosis [3\u20135]. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) or quantitative RT- PCR (qRT-PCR) is useful for the rapid differential diagnosis; however, detection of viral antigens in tissues is essential for confirming each viral infection.",

Immunofluorescence (IF) staining is the first immunohistochemical staining method but is still widely used in veterinary and medical diagnosis. With fundamentality of antigen-antibody and antibody-antibody binding reactions, antigens are visualized by fluorescent dyes conjugated with antibodies when activated by an exciting light of a specific wavelength (499\u2013519 nm for Alexa Fluor\u00ae488 and 494\u2013521 nm for FITC), under a fluorescence microscope. Due to the high sensitivity, specificity, and convenience in using Alexa Fluor\u00ae488 in frozen tissues, this chapter details an IF staining method for the rapid and precise detection of PEDV antigens in PEDV-infected, frozen tissues, contributing to verification of the tissue sites of PEDV replication in infected pigs. A combination of PEDV-specific anti-sera as antigen detection antibody and secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae488 is applied in the IF staining method. However, because of suboptimal conditions of tissue or cell morphology in frozen tissues, this staining method limits investigation of the correlation of PEDV antigens with histopathologic lesions.",

After adding a substrate of enzyme, such as Fast Red, it generates insoluble particles that can be localized in cells or tissues under light microscope. Compared to the IF staining in frozen tissues, the IHC in FFPE tissues has more accurate localization of antigens with a better contrast ratio, contributing to defining the correlation of PEDV antigen-positive cells with severity of histopathologic lesions caused by PEDV, such as intestinal villous atrophy.",

The use of hyperimmune anti-sera or polyclonal antibodies against PEDV in IHC staining is likely able to detect geographically different strains of PEDV and differentiate them from TGEV in tissues [8, 9], but with a potential disadvantage of inducing background or false signals. To improve the sensitivity and specificity of IHC for the detection of PEDV antigens in tissues, the use of monoclonal antibodies to structural proteins of PEDV, such as spike (S) or membrane (M) protein, has been preferred [10, 11]. Prior to their application on the tissues, potential cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies to TGEV and PDCoV can be tested by more sensitive assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation, compared to IHC.",

PEDV-infected enterocytes rapidly undergo acute necrosis, leading to marked villous atrophy in the small but not large intestine [10]. In PEDV-infected nursing pigs, major histologic lesions include acute diffuse, severe atrophic enteritis, and mild vacuolation of superficial epithelial cells and subepithelial edema in cecum and colon [8\u201310, 13]. PEDV antigens are observed mainly in villous enterocytes of the small (duodenum to ileum) and large intestines (except rectum) [1, 8, 10]. Occasionally, a few PEDV-positive cells were detected in the intestinal crypt cells or the Peyer\u2019s patches [1, 8\u201310]. No lesions were seen in the spleen, liver, lung, kidney, and mesenteric lymph node of orally and/or intranasally infected piglets [8]. Lung tissue of oronasally infected pigs was negative for PEDV antigen [1, 8\u201310]. PEDV antigens were not detected in other major organs, such as the pylorus, tonsils, liver, and kidneys. However, a recent study reported the replication of PEDV in swine pulmonary macrophages in vitro and in vivo [14].",

A large amount of washing buffer, 1\u00d7 PBS, is needed, because complete washing is critical to reduce background and increase true signals.Throughout immunostaining procedures, the tissues should stay rehydrated. Adequate antigen-antibody or antibody-antibody binding reaction is not expected in dried tissues, resulting in poor or weak staining results or a high level of background staining. It is also critical for a comparative immunostaining study in multiple different tissues.The optimal dilutions of primary and secondary antibodies should be tested and selected in both frozen and FFPE tissue conditions.Instead of plastic pipette tips, the use of glass dropping pipette will reduce the number of bubbles in the mounting medium as applied to the tissue sections.When the Fast Red tablet is completely dissolved, the solution can be filtered via 0.9 \u03bcm syringe filter and used to reduce an irregular deposition of Fast Red on the tissues or background.The color development, including intensity of true or false signals, in all tissue slides tested should be frequently monitored under the microscope. Wipe the non-charged slide surface with Kimwipes before putting the tissue slides on the microscope.Gently drop the mounting medium so as not to create bubbles. The mounted slides need to be evaluated as soon as possible, because bubbles can be created spontaneously in the mounted medium.To make the stained slides permanent, a large amount of mounting medium can be applied to the tissues so that the entire section is covered. Place slides horizontally in a 60 \u00b0C oven for 30 min to allow the medium to harden. Remove the slides from the oven, and allow them to cool at RT. Dip the slides in xylene and cover slip with permount permanent mounting medium (Fisher Scientific).\n",
