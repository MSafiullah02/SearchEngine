On the other hand, searching for host factors involved in transcription and replication of RNA viruses has proven to be much trickier. Originally, the prevailing seemingly simple view of virus genome replication was modeled on the replication of RNA phages such as Q\u03b2 (Klovins 1999, Schuppli 2000). Yet it soon became apparent that the situation is far more complex for eukaryotic RNA viruses than for RNA phages.",

            "text": "Multiplication of the genome of most RNA viruses takes place in the cytoplasm. However, influenza virus (Orthomyxoviridae) (Wang et al., 1997) and Borna disease virus (Paramyxoviridae) (Pyper et al., 1998) replicate in the nucleus. An interesting consequence of this nuclear localization is that transcription in these viruses can be accompanied by splicing, a process requiring the host's splicing machinery (Lamb 1991, Tomonaga 2002). In addition, an increasing number of RNA viruses require the nucleus in certain steps of their life cycle (Hiscox, 2003). Arenaviruses cannot complete their replication cycle in cells enucleated soon after infection (Borden et al., 1998). On the other hand, certain (+) as well as (\u2212) strand RNA viruses grow in enucleate cells, virus yield being related to the length of the virus growth cycle (Follett et al., 1975). Several viruses target some of their proteins to the nucleus (Hiscox 2003, Urcuqui\u2010Inchima 2001), whereas others such as hepatitis C virus (HCV; Flaviviridae) code for proteins that contain nuclear localization signals but do not seem to enter the nucleus (Song et al., 2000). Finally, infection by members of the Picornaviridae, such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus, and by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; Rhabdoviridae) (Belov 2000, Gustin 2001) triggers relocation of certain nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm, suggesting that these proteins probably participate in the life cycle of the virus (Hiscox, 2003).",

Since sgRNAs are generally 3\u2032 coterminal, an internally located open reading frame (ORF) in the genomic (g) RNA can become 5\u2032 proximal in the sgRNA, a more favorable situation for the eukaryotic translation apparatus. To date, most of the information available concerning the role of host factors in viral RNA amplification deals with replication, while information concerning host factors and transcription is less abundant except for (\u2212) strand RNA viruses and for viruses of the Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Closteroviridae families (Miller and Koev, 2000).",

The viral polymerase and other viral proteins as well as host factors participate in RNA transcription and replication. Yet, how the switch occurs between transcription and replication remains largely enigmatic. During replication, the RNA strand complementary to the genome strand is produced in far lower amounts than the newly synthesized genome strands. How this imbalance is regulated and what factors may be involved in this bias is also far from clear. Nevertheless, some results have appeared suggesting that certain host factors participate in synthesis of one but not of the other strand.",

Red clover necrotic mosaic tombusvirus (Sit et al., 1998) and citrus tristeza closterovirus (Gowda et al., 2001) generate (\u2212) strand sgRNAs that might function as templates for sg mRNA synthesis. Production of sgRNAs in viruses of the Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae families (both of the order Nidovirales) involves a mechanism similar to splicing known as discontinuous sgRNA synthesis: the transcripts are both 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 coterminal (Fig. 2\n). In this strategy, synthesis of a sgRNA proceeds on a template. The initiated sgRNA, together with the polymerase, then switches from its position to another complementary region called transcription\u2010regulating sequence (TRS) on the template to which it can base\u2010pair and resume synthesis. The step at which the nascent RNA chain is transferred from one region of the template to another remains controversial\u2014it could occur during (+) or (\u2212) strand synthesis. The recent demonstration of the presence of (\u2212) sg strands favors the latter possibility (Pasternak 2001, Sawicki 2001). TRSs present in the 3\u2032 end of the leader and at the 5\u2032 end of the sgRNA body regions in the gRNA could allow the nascent RNA chain to be transferred to the leader TRS by TRS\u2010TRS (sense\u2010antisense) base\u2010pairing, or conversely could allow the RNA chain in the leader to be transferred to the sgRNA.",

Similar difficulties have been encountered in searching for specific host factors that interact with the viral genome. These difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that it is often difficult to distinguish between factors that directly affect RNA replication/transcription from those that have an indirect effect on viral RNA synthesis, such as by interacting with host factors that in turn are directly involved in RNA amplification. Gel\u2010shift mobility assays, UV\u2010crosslinking, coimmunoprecipitation, and the yeast two\u2010 or three\u2010hybrid systems have served to search for interactions between host factors and the viral polymerase and/or the viral RNA. Yet the relevance of such interactions remains equivocal in the absence of functional RNA amplification assays. In many cases, particular caution must therefore surround published data, and further experiments are needed to determine whether copurification and/or interaction with viral proteins or RNA is fortuitous or has a functional significance. Technologies such as the systematic search for host genes became involved in virus RNA amplification using an ordered genome\u2010wide set of deletion mutants (Kushner et al., 2003) and RNA interference (Ahlquist 2002, Isken 2003, Lan 2003, Li 2002a), are beginning to provide promising results that nevertheless still require further verification.",

In addition, some of the factors identified to date appear to influence viral RNA amplification as well as viral protein synthesis, and translation and replication are frequently tightly associated. This situation adds a further level of complication to the identification of host factors involved in a specific viral function. It will hopefully become possible to overcome this problem by examining the effect of a given host factor on the replicase and its activity, and in parallel its effect on translation in vitro and in vivo. Such experiments have been undertaken (Choi et al., 2002) and have already provided interesting information concerning transcription in a coronavirus.",

Another host factor, designated HF, is also required for (\u2212) strand synthesis from the (+) strand RNA template. In the generally accepted scenario, the polymerase provides the polymerizing activity, whereas S1 allows the enzyme complex to bind to two (S and M) internal sites in the viral genome (Table II\n; Fig. 4\n). The long\u2010standing observation that the polymerase subunit binds to internal sites on the viral genome remained a paradox for several decades. Indeed, if the enzyme is to faithfully replicate the template, it must somehow also lie close to the 3\u2032 end of the template. It has now been established that this is achieved at least in part by elaborate secondary structures in the viral RNA (Fig. 4) that bring the 3\u2032 end of the viral RNA in close proximity to the internal sites where the polymerase is positioned (Klovins and van Duin, 1999), facilitating this interaction.",

Overexpression of NS5B and its C\u2010terminally truncated mutant in the transiently transfected cell line also inhibited negative strand synthesis, probably due to sequestration of p68.

PB2 cleaves 5\u2032 oligonucleotides containing the cap structure from cellular mRNAs in the cap\u2010snatching scenario. PB1 is the catalytic subunit for viral RNA synthesis and uses the capped oligonucleotides as primers for transcription. The function of the phosphoprotein PA remains unclear. In addition, the nucleoprotein NP is required for synthesis of full\u2010length RNA (Momose et al., 2001), and as such it forms part of the replicase complex. Various proteins have been shown to interact with the NP. Among them is the nucleoprotein interactor 5 (NPI\u20105, also known as RAF\u20102p48, BAT1 or UAP56), a cellular splicing factor (Momose et al., 2001). It interacts with free NP, but not with NP\u2010RNA complexes, and stimulates synthesis of the viral RNA. Its interaction with NP is disrupted by the addition of large amounts of viral RNA that bind to NP, suggesting that NPI\u20105 may facilitate loading of NP on the RNA, thus acting as a chaperone. In influenza virus\u2010infected cells, NPI\u20105 disappears from spliceosomes, where it is concentrated in uninfected cells. Its relocalization is similar to that of another splicing\u2010related host protein, the NS1\u2010binding protein (NS1\u2010BP), which depends on the presence and distribution of the viral nonstructural protein NS1 (Wolff et al., 1998). The same distribution pattern of the three proteins (NPI\u20105, NS1\u2010BP, and NS1) in infected cells suggests that NPI\u20105 may indirectly contribute to shutoff of host protein synthesis in these cells, due to inhibition of splicing and 3\u2032\u2010terminal processing of pre\u2010mRNAs by the NS1 protein (Momose 2001, Wolff 1998).",

They are involved in poliovirus RNA translation and replication (Gamarnik and Andino, 1998). When bound to the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of poliovirus RNA, PCBP probably enhances translation (Blyn et al., 1997), but it also regulates RNA synthesis since its binding to the disrupted stem\u2010loop IV of the IRES negatively affects replication (Gamarnik and Andino, 2000). It also binds to the 5\u2032 cloverleaf structure of the poliovirus RNA upstream of the IRES (Gamarnik 1997, Gamarnik 1998, Parsley 1997) to which the poliovirus 3CD polymerase also binds, and where it is essential for initiation of (\u2212) RNA synthesis. Studies have aimed at investigating the functions of the different PCBP isoforms as well as identifying the domains of these factors involved in poliovirus translation and replication using PCBP\u2010depleted cell extracts. Using this approach, it was shown that PCBP2 rescues both RNA replication and translation initiation, whereas PCBP1 rescues only replication (Walter et al., 2002). PCBP thus seems to be involved in the switch from viral RNA translation to replication that may result from a change in the relative homo\u2010 and hetero\u2010dimer concentrations of both isoforms.",

On one hand, by UV\u2010cross\u2010linking and immunoprecipitation, it was reported that hnRNP A1 binds to the common TRSs in the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; Coronaviridae) RNA of the complementary (\u2212) leader and (\u2212) intergenic regions, which conform to the consensus PTB\u2010binding motif. Hence, hnRNP A1 was proposed to bring together the two elements of the viral RNA involved in transcription (Huang 2001, Li 1997). Moreover, MHV RNA transcription and replication were stimulated by overexpression of hnRNP A1, and inhibited by dominant\u2010negative mutants of hnRNP A1 (Shi et al., 2000). On the other hand, however, the hnRNP A1\u2010binding motif found in MHV transcription\u2010regulating sequences is not conserved in other Nidovirales, and MHV replication and transcription were not affected when a cell line not expressing hnRNP A1 was used (Shen and Masters, 2001). The protein is thus dispensable for MHV replication and transcription. Furthermore, recent results indicate that hnRNP A1\u2010related proteins can replace hnRNP A1 for MHV RNA synthesis in hnRNP A1\u2010depleted cells (Shi et al., 2003). Therefore, similar functions may be exerted by closely related proteins, making it difficult to assign conclusive roles to certain cellular proteins in viral genome amplification.",

Binding to these sites is required for transcription (Huang and Lai, 1999). To further elucidate the role of PTB in MHV RNA synthesis and discriminate between an effect on transcription and translation, defective interfering (DI) RNAs harboring different reporter genes were transfected into stable cell lines overexpressing full\u2010length or truncated PTB (Choi et al., 2002). When these overexpressing cell lines were infected with a DI RNA\u2014coding for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) preceded by the intergenic region\u2014that had to be transcribed during MHV infection to undergo translation, CAT activity was much lower than in control cell lines, suggesting that PTB overexpression had a dominant\u2010negative effect on translation and/or transcription. To determine whether PTB was affecting translation or transcription, cell lines overexpressing PTB were transfected with an in vitro transcribed DI RNA containing part of the MHV ORF1a fused to the luciferase gene and flanked by the MHV 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. The same level of luciferase activity was obtained in cells overexpressing PTB as in control cells. Likewise, synthesis of a reporter protein in a reticulocyte lysate previously depleted of PTB was the same as in a control undepleted lysate. These last two series of experiments demonstrate that PTB is directly involved in RNA synthesis, not in translation. Moreover, PTB interacts in vivo and in vitro with the viral N protein, an element of the replication complex, supporting the idea that PTB is part of the viral transcription/replication machinery (Choi et al., 2002).",

However, because the poliovirus translation products accumulate, and because PTB is cleaved by the viral protease 3Cpro and/or 3CDpro, during late stages of infection the concentration of PTB would no longer be sufficient to favor translation, leading to a switch from translation to replication (Back et al., 2002).",

One of the host proteins that bind to the West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae) 3\u2032 hairpin in the (\u2212) RNA strand has recently been identified as TIAR (Li et al., 2002b). TIA\u20101 also binds to the same region in the viral RNA. Moreover, virus growth is inefficient in TIAR knockout cells, and when such cells are complemented with a vector expressing TIAR, WNV growth is partially restored. Thus, TIAR and possibly also TIA\u20101 are functionally important for WNV replication.

Interaction of the three proteins NF90/NFAR\u20101, NF45, and RNA helicase A (RHA), known as the \u201cNFAR\u201d group to both the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs, was unambiguously demonstrated (Isken et al., 2003). Mutations of the proteins' interaction sites in the 3\u2032 UTR decreased protein binding and RNA replication (measured as progeny (+) RNA synthesis). Similarly, transfection of cell lines supporting BVDV replication with siRNAs directed against RHA led to 60\u201385% reduction of viral replication. The data suggest that the NFAR proteins may mediate circularization of the viral RNA leading to a switch from translation to replication. Interestingly, this group of proteins is also believed to be part of the antiviral response of the cell that seems to be subverted by the virus for the purpose of its propagation. The direct involvement of the NFAR proteins in viral replication and not in translation will require confirmation by further experiments.",

Experiments were carried out using a subgenomic HCV replicon in a hepatocyte cell line transfected with siRNA against hVAP\u201033 or overexpressing truncated versions of hVAP\u201033.

The organism retorts with a series of programmed responses to counteract the development of virus infection. This situation triggers reiterated counteroffensives between the host and the virus. Whereas the host is indispensable for the virus, the reverse is rarely true. It is only in very few cases that the presence of a virus is beneficial for the host as in the case of yeast strains infected with dsRNA viruses that secrete peptide toxins lethal to virus\u2010free yeast cells (Sesti et al., 2001). Thus, it can appear surprising that so many host factors normally engaged in vital cell functions can be subverted by the virus for its own benefit. The participation of an ever\u2010increasing number of host factors in virus replication/transcription is indeed somewhat unexpected, as is the variety of these factors. Moreover, the borrowed factors do not necessarily serve the same function in virus development such as in RNA replication/transcription as they serve in the host, making their identification more laborious. Indeed, some of them are usually associated with functions distantly related to nucleic acid multiplication. In many cases, it still cannot be dismissed that these factors act by stimulating other factors that are more directly involved in viral RNA genome amplification.",

It has been shown that relatively pure preparations of several RdRps can replicate certain natural or synthetic RNAs. Specificity is provided in large part by ancillary viral factors and by a cohort of satellite host factors (Klovins 1999, Lai 1998). Intracellular virus\u2013host interactions are both intimate and varied. Certain viruses are tissue specific, restricted to certain cell types, and this must be ascribed to the presence or absence of adequate host factors anywhere along the path of virus development. Other viruses replicate in diverse hosts, indicating that critical cell proteins required by these viruses must be highly conserved between host species. An interesting example of this situation is provided by experiments showing that the insect virus FHV not only multiplies but also systemically spreads through a transgenic plant expressing the viral movement protein of a plant virus (Dasgupta et al., 2001).",

Circularization involves the participation of cap\u2010 and poly(A)\u2010binding proteins. It is also important for translation and replication of RNA viruses. For viral genomes containing a cap structure and a poly(A) tail, circularization could be brought about by a mechanism similar to the one used by cellular mRNAs. For viral genomes devoid of cap and/or poly(A) tail, other mechanisms must be invoked. Host factors participate in bringing close to one another distantly located regions of the RNA in poliovirus (Gamarnik 1998, Sadowy 2001, Wimmer 1982) and Q\u03b2 phage (Klovins 1999, Schuppli 2000). There are numerous other cases of viral RNA circularization involving essentially RNA\u2013RNA interactions, and the functional importance of these interactions for viral gene expression has been demonstrated (Khromykh 2001, Shen 2004, Yang 2004). It is, however, not unlikely that as for Q\u03b2, viral and/or host factors could be implicated in regulating circularization and triggering a switch between translation and replication. Some of the same host factors could be involved in both mechanisms.",

            "text": "None of the strategies used so far to study the involvement of host factors in viral RNA amplification has been without pitfalls, and frequently the data reported attempt to answer certain but not other questions. What then might be the most appropriate strategy to unambiguously distinguish between factors involved in replication and/or transcription but not in translation, between (\u2212) and (+) strand RNA synthesis, and between those directly involved in a given mechanism and those that affect this mechanism indirectly? It would, for instance, be instructive to investigate by appropriate methods, not only synthesis of the viral genome RNA and of its complementary strand, but at the same time also translation. Such questions must ultimately be addressed both in vitro and in vivo. Having identified potential factors by a screening process such as the one involving the yeast system (Kushner et al., 2003), a reductionist approach might best be adopted to pinpoint the exact step at which a given factor is required, using various constructs, each allowing only one specific step to be examined. Following these experiments, more intricate models could be envisaged. This strategy demands huge investments in time and effort. However, it can be hoped that the availability of eukaryotic genome sequences and of an ever increasing number of infectious viral clones and replicons, the development of more reliable replication systems, and finally the advent of nanotechnology will facilitate such endeavors. Moreover, the rapidly developing RNA interference methodology and its application to genome\u2010wide screening of gene functions and protein interactions, including in mammals, now enables large\u2010scale identification of host genes whose down regulation (knock\u2010down) will have a severe impact on viral replication (Fraser 2004, Paddison 2004). An HCV replicon\u2010bearing human hepatocarcinoma cell line that has become one of the favorite models to study host factor influence on viral genome amplification would be a good target for such an experiment.",
