Despite their numerous successes, classical vaccine strategies that rely on attenuated or inactivated pathogen formulations, have failed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against a number of pathogens. Some notable examples are long-standing viral threats like Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) or Dengue as well as emerging pathogens such as Zika, amongst others. Additionally, the constant antigenic drift of Influenza requires formulation of seasonal vaccines, and has prevented the development of a universally protective vaccine [2].",

In essence, this strategy relies on the isolation of nAbs from human or animal repertoires, followed by the structural characterization of the nAb\u2013antigen complex, and finally exploit the acquired atomic-level information to design novel immunogens. A key challenge for next-generation vaccines, then, is to place neutralizing epitopes in the immune system\u2019s spotlight for efficient recognition and enhanced epitope-specific antibody elicitation. We refer to such class of vaccines as precision vaccines, given their extremely well-defined epitope-directed antibody response. An essential requisite for precision vaccines is to encode the structural information of epitopes targeted by broad and potent neutralizing antibodies in the designed immunogens.",

Despite this immunodominance towards the head domain, several epitopes in the HA stem region are targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) [8,9], providing a strong rationale for vaccines that aim to induce antibody responses towards the HA stem. Two independent studies reported the design of immunogens comprising only the HA-stem domain [10,11\u2022]. Several rounds of structure-based design were performed, including the removal of the entire head domain followed by the introduction of stabilizing core mutations and linker design. Upon vaccination with stem derived antigens, mice, ferrets and cynomolgus monkeys mounted a cross-reactive antibody response and survived a challenge with a lethal dose of a highly pathogenic viral isolate.",

The introduction of two glycans on V3 was shown to dampen the immune response against this site upon rabbit immunization [15].

In immunization studies, prefusion RSVF was eight times more potent in terms of neutralization than postfusion RSVF, as observed in mice, non-human primates and cotton rats. A large fraction of the elicited antibodies was directed against the apex of RSVF, a site that undergoes profound conformational changes in the postfusion state [20]. In a follow up article, Joyce and colleagues further stabilized Ds-Cav1, resulting in an immunogen with improved physical stability in the prefusion state (RSVF-DS2). In mice, DS2 variants elicited up to four-fold more potent neutralizing responses as compared to Ds-Cav1, indicating that conformational stability correlated with immunogenicity [22\u2022]. As a more relevant model for human RSV disease, a bovine RSVF-DS2 version elicited bovine RSV neutralizing antibodies >100-fold higher than postfusion F in calves, and conferred full protection of upper and lower respiratory tract upon viral challenge [23].",

A particular challenge for Env engineering is to maintain its native conformation upon recombinant expression, and reduce the conformational `breathing\u2019 between the open and closed conformations that have been reported for the prefusion Env. The most widely used construct for native-like Env design is the SOSIP.664 trimer, which is stabilized by an intermolecular disulfide bond, an isoleucine-proline substitution within the fusion peptide and a truncation to remove the hydrophobic membrane proximal region. While a comprehensive analysis of the efforts to stabilize Env is beyond the scope of this article and have been the subject of several reviews [27,28], we highlight two recent studies that employed rational stabilization strategies to suppress non-neutralizing antibody responses.",

The reverse vaccinology strategy was envisioned as an integrated approach to design immunogens that elicit or boost preexisting antibody responses focused on bona fide neutralization epitopes. In the age of systems approaches and big-data science, our understanding of complex biological phenomena, such as an immune response, has been hugely expanded. Therefore, we are now able to define with exquisite accuracy the molecular determinants desirable for a particular vaccine development endeavor. Those determinants include, but are not limited to, antigen conformations, desired antibody lineages and key neutralization epitopes, which lead us to conclude that we have entered into a new age of precision vaccines. Structure-based approaches, as reviewed here, are essential to define the target problem and realize the full potential of precision vaccines. Despite the successes so far, none of the strategies described here have proven to be the `one-fits-all\u2019 solution. While a prefusion stabilized RSVF was a far superior immunogen than the postfusion counterpart, the same approach for MPVF did not enhance the neutralizing responses. Similarly, the sole conformational stabilization of HIV Env is deemed unlikely to elicit bnAbs [53] and germline targeting approaches hold great promise to prime a bnAb response. Finally, while epitope-scaffolds elicited very potent and specific monoclonal antibodies in NHPs, the average neutralization titers were rather low.",

Four main strategies have been used to design improved immunogens for the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies that target precise conformational states, epitopes or antibody lineages. Center: All these strategies were employed to stabilize viral fusion proteins or to enhance antibody responses towards neutralizing epitopes located in viral fusion proteins. Center-bottom: The structure-based approaches can be classified according to expected epitope specificity and neutralization potency of the elicited antibody responses. Upper left: Silencing non-neutralizing epitopes. Glycosylation or deletion of Influenza\u2019s hemagglutinin head domain enables the focusing of antibody responses towards more conserved epitopes targeted by bnAbs. Lower left: Antigenic conformational stabilization. Respiratory Syncytial Virus fusion protein (RSVF) adopts two distinct conformations, a metastable prefusion state (right), and a stable postfusion state (left). Stabilizing the prefusion conformation boosts the induction of neutralizing antibodies. Upper right: Germline targeting. A domain of the HIV-1 Envelope protein (Env) is modified to trigger the activation of inferred germline precursors of HIV-1 bnAbs. After priming, B-cell maturation is guided through consecutive boostings with increasingly native Env versions to select for antibodies that can bind the epitope in its native context. Lower right: Epitope scaffolding. A structurally characterized neutralizing epitope is transplanted onto a heterologous, synthetic protein scaffold, which is used to elicit virus-reactive antibodies targeting the desired epitope.",
