            "text": "The subfamily Paramyxovirinae in the family Paramyxoviridae comprises the five genera Respiro-, Morbilli-, Rubula-, Avula-, and Henipavirus, as well as a group of yet unclassified viruses [1]. The genus Henipavirus contains two of the most pathogenic viruses known in humans, Hendra- and Nipah virus, which were discovered only in 1994 and 1998, respectively [2]\u2013[5]. Both viruses cause severe encephalitis in humans, exemplified by the Nipah virus outbreaks in Malaysia, India and Bangladesh with case fatality rates ranging from 40\u2013100% [6]\u2013[10]. Work on these viruses is restricted to biosafety level-four laboratories. Typically, Henipaviruses are not circulating in humans, but can be acquired from domestic animals such as pigs or horses [6], [11]. Direct transmission of Nipah virus between humans has been described and transmission from bats to humans was implicated in Nipah virus outbreaks not related to pig farming [12]\u2013[14]. Drastic control measures may be necessary to contain outbreaks of Henipaviruses, as exemplified by the culling of more than one million pigs during a Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia in 1999 [11]. Henipaviruses seem to have their primary reservoir in fruit bats of the genus Pteropus, in the family Pteropodidae. Serologic evidence for Henipavirus infection in bats has been reported in a geographic range covering Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, and Madagascar [9], [15]\u2013[20]. Hendra virus was isolated from bats in Australia, and Nipah virus in Malaysia and Cambodia. Detection of Henipavirus RNA has been accomplished in Thailand (Nipah virus) and Australia (Hendra virus) [20]. Consequently, the geographic range of Pteropus seems to limit the geographic range of Hendra and Nipah virus encephalitis in humans [8], [20], [21].",

This is remarkable because E. helvum is highly abundant in Africa and colonies are believed to conduct annual transcontinental migration, following the rainfall gradient to suitable feeding grounds, with reports on individual bats travelling up to 2,000 kilometres [23], [24]. E. helvum is a rather large fruit bat that roosts exposed and at high densities in trees during daytime. The animals are frequently hunted and consumed by humans as a supplementary source of protein [25]\u2013[27].",

Additionally, of those samples that yielded positive RT-PCR results, mitochondrial DNA was amplified and sequenced for species confirmation as described [28]. Bat droppings were collected on plastic film. Ca. 100 mg of feces were suspended in 500 \u00b5l of RNAlater solution immediately after dropping. Suspensions were homogenised by vortexing and 50 \u00b5l were suspended into 560 \u00b5l of Buffer AVL from the Qiagen viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and processed further according to the instructions of the manufacturer as described earlier [29]. Elution volume was 50 \u00b5l. Broad-range PCR for the genus Henipavirus was done as recently described, yielding amplicons of 496 base pairs located across domains I and II of the polymerase gene [30]. Sanger sequencing of PCR products was done using dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems). Bayesian inference of phylogeny was done using BEAST, version 1.4.8 [31] with both nucleotide- (GTR+I+gamma) and codon-based (SRD06) substitution models [32]. The most applicable population model was determined by using both the ESS statistic for all traces and the Bayes factor test on the posterior probability trace of each run with TRACER. Metropolis-coupled Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains with 2X10E7 iterations were sampled every 1000 generations, resulting in 20,000 sampled trees.",

The genetic distance between these viruses and Hendra and Nipah virus was compatible with the distance observed within other established Paramyxoviridae genera, suggesting that the novel viruses might constitute members of the Henipavirus genus. The considerable sequence divergence between the three novel putative Henipaviruses encountered in one huge colony might indicate substantial genetic variability of related viruses in bats. Formal taxonomic classification according to conventions for Paramyxoviridae will require the characterization of additional genomic features, such as the phylogenies of the nucleoprotein and F genes, the lengths of intergenic regions, as well as the predicted transcription start sites of subgenomic RNAs [1], [3]. Unfortunately, sequencing of longer genomic fragments was not successful from our samples, most likely due to the low concentration of RNA encountered. This was also the assumed reason for failure of virus isolation.",

Large colonies of E. helvum are widely observed in urban areas of Subsaharan Africa [27], [37]. In the location studied here, hundreds of visitors and staff enter the zoo on a daily basis and may become exposed. The ways of exposure may be key features in the understanding of the origin of epidemics of bat-borne viruses, such as Ebolaviruses, Henipaviruses, or Coronaviruses [9], [38]\u2013[41]. It has been proposed that humans may be exposed to viruses from fruit bats that chew fruits and spit out the pulp at feeding sites [42]. However, it appears that E. helvum uses urban habitats only for roosting and rarely for feeding. Nevertheless, detailed studies on the foraging behavior of E. helvum are lacking. Another way of exposition may be via contact with bat urine or fecal material. In this study we have sampled bat feces that are abundant under trees in urban E. helvum roosting sites. Interestingly, the observed virus RNA concentrations in fecal material were rather low as compared to enteric viruses transmitted via the fecal-oral route in humans [43]\u2013[45]. Bat urine was frequently described to contain Henipaviruses [15], [41], [46]. Despite immediate recollection of fecal samples from plastic sheets in this study, contamination of these samples with bat urine cannot be completely excluded. Overall, our data suggests a limited risk of exposure to virus from bat feces. This is important to note to prevent any premature action aiming at extirpating flying foxes as potential virus hosts, as this may disrupt important ecological functions, i.e., seed dispersal and pollination. However, our sample size was limited and more studies are required to determine whether RNA concentrations may vary within bat colonies, and over time.",
