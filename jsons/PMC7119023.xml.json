            "text": "Influenza in pregnant women has historically been associated with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality. The course of influenza in pregnancy was first reported during the epidemic of 1918, when 1350 cases in pregnant women who had an influenza-like illness were evaluated. Pneumonia complicated 585 (43%) of the cases. In 52% of these patients, the pregnancy was interrupted. There were 308 (23%) maternal deaths. Mortality was highest in the last 3 months of pregnancy, and increased if complicated by pneumonia [6]. During the influenza epidemic of 1957, 22 pregnant women in New York City died from complications of the flu. Pregnant women accounted for nearly half the deaths of women of childbearing age [7]. During the same epidemic, 11 pregnant women died in Minnesota. All deaths were attributed to respiratory insufficiency secondary to pulmonary edema and pneumonia [8]. Mullooly and colleagues [9] reviewed influenza complicating pregnancy from 1975 to 1979. There were four epidemics in that 5-year time period. Pregnant women sought outpatient medical attention for acute respiratory disease during the influenza season significantly more often than nonpregnant women; however, unlike the previously reported epidemics, there were no maternal deaths attributable to influenza, and the hospitalization rate was low at 2 per 1000.",

Rapid testing by either immunofluorescence or immunoassay has the advantage of providing same-day diagnosis; however, it does not have the same sensitivity as culture. There are various rapid tests on the market. Some detect influenza but cannot distinguish influenza A from B. Others detect both and can distinguish them. Nasal samples provide a higher level of sensitivity than do throat samples when performing rapid testing. The positive and negative predictive value of the rapid tests depends on the level of influenza activity in the population being tested. Patients who have a clinical picture highly suggestive of influenza but with a negative rapid test should still be cultured, because false negatives do occur [4], [12]. Viral culture is necessary to subtype influenza as well as to perform drug sensitivities.",

Local consolidation is seen on chest radiograph with superimposed bacterial pneumonia. Myopathy is another complication that has been associated with influenza. Patients may develop rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. In adults, myopathy is more commonly found with influenza A. It has been suggested that a genetic predisposition exists for this complication. Pathology slides of muscle biopsies taken from patients who had suspected influenza-associated myopathy showed lysis of muscle fibers. Carditis has also been reported. The influenza virus has been isolated from the myocardium of patients who died of influenza complications. With carditis there are often EKG changes, including ST changes, inverted T waves, and rate disturbances. Carditis can occur at the same time as the initial respiratory manifestations. Finally, encephalopathy is a rare complication of influenza. The virus has been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue at autopsy. Encephalopathy is also thought to be genetically linked [5].",

Influenza has been associated with limb reduction and neural tube defects, including anencephaly [16], [17], [18]. Other investigators have not found an association between influenza and anencephaly [19]. Several studies have noted an increased incidence of schizophrenia in people who were born 2 to 3 months after an influenza epidemic, implying that maternal exposure to influenza in the second trimester, when fetal neurons are migrating, is a risk factor [20], [21]. There have also been reports of an increased incidence of cleft lip [22], [23]. Unfortunately, many studies are limited by recall and selection bias, making it unclear if there truly is an association.",

Given as chemoprophylaxis, they are 70% to 90% effective at preventing influenza. They also can be given within the first 48 hours of symptoms to reduce symptom duration. To minimize drug resistance, therapy should be discontinued within 24 to 48 hours after symptoms resolve, or 3 to 5 days. Most notable side effects are of the central nervous system and include confusion, insomnia, and difficulty concentrating [25]. The neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in the treatment of influenza A and B. Oseltamivir, given orally, is approved for both treatment and chemoprophylaxis. It is reported to be 70% to 90% effective at preventing influenza [26]. The most commonly reported side effects are nausea and vomiting [27]. Zanamivir is an inhaled medication approved for treatment only. It should be noted that there have been several reports of bronchospasm in patients who have asthma and who take this drug. Both shorten the duration of symptoms by, on average, 1 day. There are limited data on safety in pregnancy. All four drugs are US Food and Drug Administration category C, and therefore should be used only when the benefits outweigh the risks [28].",

            "text": "The primary method of influenza prevention is vaccination. Vaccination is most effective when performed in October or November, although unvaccinated patients should not be denied vaccination later in the season. The recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is that all women who will be pregnant during the influenza season should receive the vaccine. Vaccination can be performed safely in any trimester of pregnancy [29], [30]. Breast feeding is not a contraindication to vaccination [4]. There are two different vaccines available. One is a live-attenuated vaccine (LAIV), whereas the other is inactivated. The inactivated vaccine is used for pregnant women as well as all other high risk groups. The LAIV is recommended only for healthy persons ages 5 to 49. The inactivated vaccine is less expensive. Both vaccines are contraindicated in people who have an anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or other components of the vaccine, people who have an acute febrile illness, and people who have a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination. Peak antibody protection develops 2 weeks after vaccination [31], [32]. Inactivated vaccine in the United States that is distributed in single-dose syringes is preservative-free and contains only trace amounts of thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound. Thus, there is little concern for mercury exposure because it is limited to less than 0.5 mcg mercury/0.25-mL dose [33]. Vaccine efficacy in healthy adults less than 65 years of age is 70% to 90% if circulating and vaccine viruses are antigenically similar [4].",

The chest radiograph will confirm pneumonia, rule out other diagnoses, suggest a possible etiology, and aid in determining the severity of illness. Multilobar pneumonia is considered a more severe process than single lobar involvement [39]. Generally, all pregnant women who have pneumonia are hospitalized for observation and initial therapy. Work-up should include a complete blood count, electrolytes, assessment of oxygenation, and blood cultures; however, blood cultures have been found to be positive only 7% to 15% of the time [37], [40].",

There have only been a handful of cases of pneumonia secondary to histoplasmosis reported [68]. Although still extremely limited, there are more case reports of blastomycosis. Lemos and colleagues [69] reviewed 19 cases of blastomycosis in pregnancy. Seventy-eight percent had pulmonary involvement, and all recovered or were at least reported as having a \u201cgood response.\u201d In two cases, the newborn died and was found to have blastomycosis at autopsy. Treatment is with amphotericin B or ketoconazole. Ely and coworkers [70] reported four cases of cryptococcal pneumonia. All were otherwise healthy women. Cryptococcal pneumonia is difficult to diagnosis. In this case series, all women eventually underwent a lung biopsy to make the diagnosis. Symptoms include cough, chest pain, and dyspnea. Chest radiograph findings can vary greatly and include infiltrates, mass lesions, and adenopathy. Treatment is with amphotericin B. Coccidioidomycosis results from the inhalation of Coccidioides immitis. One third of infected persons will develop a symptomatic illness. Complications of coccidioidomycosis include pneumonia and disseminated disease [71]. Symptoms include cough, fever, and erythema nodosum [72]. Erythema nodosum has been reported to be a marker of good outcome in pregnant women [73]. Dissemination of disease in pregnancy is a controversial topic. Historically, dissemination was reported to be 40 to 100 times more frequent in pregnancy [74]. Caldwell and colleagues [72] found the incidence of dissemination in pregnancy to be 9%, three times the rate of the nonpregnant population. In their series, 23/32 recovered without treatment, and there were no deaths. Risk factors include living in an endemic area, smoking, older age, diabetes, and low socioeconomic status [71]. Treatment is with amphotericin B.",
