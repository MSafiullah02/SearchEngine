In 2003 Severe Acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) caused the global epidemic. From 2003 to 2004 SARS-CoV infected 8096 people in 29 countries where 774 souls were lost [22] . MERS-CoV was even deadly and took 858 lives out of 2494 people since 2012 [23] . Even so in 2019, the latest strain was first identified in Wuhan (Hubei province, China) suspected to be a novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) in the same family of CoV and not the unique factor in this virus is animal to human transmission which already infected 78,811 people and 2462 lives expired within 1 month (January 21th to February 23rd 2020) [24] . The amount of death and infection already passed SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection where, apart from China, 28 other countries by now detected COVID-19 and most of those confirmed cases had a travel history to Wuhan and due to asymptomatic behavior SARS-CoV-2 was able to transmit more human to human.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 507, "end": 511, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 588, "end": 592, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 948, "end": 952, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Current understanding SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Beta coronavirus group which is enveloped, single-stranded RNA and able to infect herbs, animals and humans.

More severe patients have higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1. Novel COVID-19 have some similar symptoms to SARS (e.g. fever, dry cough, shortness of breath) but there are some important differences, such as the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneezing, and sore throat) and intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea [6] . Another study showed that a healthy 6 membered family from Shenzhen traveled to Wuhan in between December 29th, 2019, to January 4th, 2020, where 5 members were diagnosed with COVID-19.

Severe hypoxemia patients received Oxygen support (e.g., nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation) [6] . Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica and Shanghai University of Science and Technology mutually found a group of old medicines and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) that might present a therapeutic effect on COVID-19. They have suggested protease inhibitors indinavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, carfilzomib, ritonavir, and 12 other anti-HIV drugs, 2 anti-respiratory syncytial virus drugs, 1 anti-human macrophage drug, 1 anti-schizophrenia drug, 1 immunosuppressive agent and 2 old drugs cinnamyl amine and cyclosporine. They also recommended that Chinese herbal medicines such as, polygonum cuspidatum and shandougen (Table 1) possibly have an active ingredient that can fight against COVID-19 [14] . Another study indicates that the use of corticosteroid might not improve COVID-19 treatment because it can suppress the immune response and pathogen clearance besides improving lung inflammation [13] . A study of 138 patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University with COVID-19 positive was treated with anti-viral (oseltamivir), antibacterial (moxifloxacin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin) and Glucocorticoid therapy. Most interestingly 6 (4.3%) died and 47 (34.06%) patients were discharged with 10 days of median hospital stay. Out of 138 patients 40 health professional were infected with COVID-19 which confirms nosocomial infection capability of SARS-CoV-2 [17] . The first case COVID-19 in the USA has been recovered with the use of remdesivir (GS-5734), a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that is under development. In this case report, the patient was treated with vancomycin and cefepime from day 5 of hospitalization (9th day of illness) but no improvement and at the day 7 (11th day of illness) of these drugs were discontinued and remdesivir was introduced. The very next day (day 8) patient health conditions became much better. He was afebrile and all symptoms improved except mild cough side by side his viral load also lowered to Ct (real time PCR gene expression) 37-40 which was Ct 18-20 on day 4 of his hospitalization [5] . Another in vitro (Vero E6 cells) study suggested the combination of remdesivir and chloroquine could be a choice. [18] This study indicates the use of remdesivir could be a major breakthrough for the treatment of COVID-19. Due to the lack of large clinical data, mass application of remdesivir still not elucidated. Another suggested drug was baricitinib, which is known for its rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Baricitinib can also inhibit AP2-associated protein kinase 1 and cyclin G-associated kinase which are important tools of viral endocytosis [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 392, "end": 395, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1097, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1299, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1765, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2436, "end": 2439, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2556, "end": 2560, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2992, "end": 2996, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1016, "end": 1025, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Present COVID-19 management"}, {"text": "According to the Chinese clinical trial registry (a database of biomedical studies in China) there are now more than 200 clinical trials are conducting on different kinds of antiviral, TCM and stem cell for better managements of COVID-19.

National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine gave guidance for COVID-19 management in the Fifth Edition for Trial Implementation titled as \"Diagnosis and treatment protocol of novel coronavirus pneumonia infection\". Here they suggested using \u03b1-interferon atomization inhalation (5 million U or equivalent dose, added with 2 ml sterile injection water, twice daily for adults), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (200 mg/50 mg per pill) 2 capsule each time, twice a day and also Ribavirin can be added (500 mg each injection, I.

It's a real irony that a couple of scientists from Wuhan Institute of Virology (February 2019) published an article which forecasted that China would likely be the next possible hotspot of coronavirus outbreak. Popular cultural beliefs in slaughtering the live animal to consume more nutrition and close contact with the bats were suspected for the potential reemerge of the viral transmission [4] . Current treatment was able to discharge lots of COVID-19 infected patients after two nucleic acid tests were negative which means there were no virus replication. At the same time these recovered patients produced their own antibody which can last longer than 6 months so, second degree infection is unlikely unless there is a virus mutation [3] . WHO and China National health Commission is trying to design specific vaccines by isolating the virus from the host cells. China's government took very cautious action immediately by sharing the gene sequence with the WHO to facilitate the vaccine invention to accelerate the assessment.
