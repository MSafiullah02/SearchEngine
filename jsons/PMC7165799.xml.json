This approach involves integration of the gene of interest into the plant genome, and it has been used successfully to express a number of immunologically active proteins. An alternative to stable genetic transformation is the use of plant virus\u2010based vectors to achieve expression. The main advantages of using the latter strategy are that viral genomes are small and easy to manipulate, infection of plants with modified viruses is simpler and quicker than the regeneration of stably transformed plants, and the sequence inserted into a virus vector will be highly amplified. However, there are some disadvantages: the foreign gene is not heritable, there are limitations on the size and complexity of the sequences that can be expressed in a genetically stable manner, and there are concerns about the ability of modified viruses to spread in the environment. Despite these difficulties, different plant virus vectors have been used for protein expression. In the present paper, we review the development of virus\u2010based vectors as a potential source of novel vaccines in plants.",

The ability of the genomes of positive\u2010sense RNA plant viruses to be directly translated on entering a plant cell has made this class of virus a very attractive choice to express recombinant proteins in infected plants\n3\n. With the development of methods that permit the manipulation of infectious cDNA clones of positive\u2010strand RNA viruses\n4\n, the exploitation of these viruses as vectors for foreign protein expression began. Since then, members of several virus families have been developed as useful vectors (Figure 1). The first strategy used for developing virus vectors was to replace existing nonessential viral genes with foreign genes. However, this replacement strategy has limitations, due to adverse consequences associated with gene deletion. A more successful approach has been to insert the foreign gene as an addition to the virus genome, avoiding the deletion of any viral genes. For reviews on the development of RNA virus\u2010based vectors, the reader is referred to Scholthof et al.\n5\n and Porta and Lomonossoff\n2\n, \n6\n.",

Given the state of knowledge of the structure of its particles, the availability of infectious cDNA clones and the potential productivity of the system, CPMV was an attractive candidate for development as an epitope presentation system. Analysis of the 3\u2010D structure of CPMV identified exposed loops on the virus surface that would potentially be suitable sites for the insertion of foreign sequences\n10\n. In most cases, the foreign sequence has been inserted into the most exposed loop on the virus surface, the \u03b2B\u2010\u03b2C loop of the S protein\n8\n, \n9\n.

The ability of modified plant virus particles to stimulate protective immunity, the ultimate goal of vaccine development, was first reported in 1997\n16\n. This study involved a CPMV chimera (CPMV\u2010PARVO1) that contained a 17 amino acid epitope from the N\u2010terminal region of the VP2 capsid protein of canine parvovirus.

The fact that TMV particles contain a large number of subunits, making the system potentially very attractive for peptide expression, is also a problem in that the subunits are very tightly packed, allowing little space on the virus surface for the expression of foreign sequences. Attempts to develop TMV as an epitope presentation system initially resulted in the production of CP subunits that were unable to assemble into virus particles. By engineering a leaky termination codon at the C\u2010terminus of the CP gene, a TMV vector was developed that permitted the synthesis of both native and recombinant forms of the CP from the same viral RNA\n20\n. As with CPMV\u2010based chimeras, the inserted peptides could be detected on the surface of assembled virions, being used to express epitopes of several animal pathogens\n21\n, \n22\n. Subsequently, by modifying the site of peptide insertion between amino acids 154 and 155, near but not at the C\u2010terminus of the CP, it has been possible to develop a TMV\u2010based vector in which all of the CP subunits could be modified to express foreign peptides abolishing virus viability\n23\n. The size of inserts that can be tolerated even at this optimized position seems to be quite small, the largest reported to date being 23 amino acids in a chimera that grew substantially more slowly than wild\u2010type TMV\n24\n.",

            "text": "The past few years have seen significant progress in the use of plant virus vectors for the production of immunogens in plants. Particularly encouraging is the fact that it is now clear that peptides or proteins expressed in this manner can confer protective immunity against a number of diseases (Table 1,Table 2), in some cases in the target animals\n16\n, \n17\n, \n57\n. In most of these cases, immunity was stimulated by parenteral immunization, but there are encouraging signs that mucosal immunization may be possible\n25\n, \n29\n, \n62\n. This raises the prospect that it may be possible to confer protective immunity by simply feeding with plant material infected with an appropriate virus construct. To achieve this, it will be necessary not only to express peptides or proteins that can stimulate mucosal immunity but also to express the material in edible plants. In this regard, the continued development of vectors that can infect edible plants \u2013 such as those based on (i) CPMV\n61\n, clover yellow vein virus (CIYVV)\n63\n and pea early browning virus (PEBV)\n64\n, all of which infect legumes; (ii) wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV)\n65\n, which infects cereals; and (iii) zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV)\n66\n, which infects cucurbits \u2013 is likely to play a prominent role. In addition, the development of combined transgene/virus complementation systems, such as those described by Sanchez\u2010Navarro et al.\n\n67\n and Mori et al.\n\n68\n, may allow the use of defective viral replicons for the expression of foreign sequences, thereby reducing the risk of environmental spread.",

Although sufficient material for initial characterization can be obtained by laboratory\u2010scale extractions, a substantial scale\u2010up of procedures will be necessary for its widescale use. To this end, results reported on the large\u2010scale growth and purification of a TMV chimera expressing a 12 amino acid malarial peptide\n69\n show that although growth under field conditions gives a lower yield per gram (fresh weight) of tissue than growth in a greenhouse, an excess of 1 kg per acre of purified particles could potentially be obtained. Similarly, it has been shown that large quantities (up to 10 mg per gram, fresh weight) of wild\u2010type CPMV could be extracted from fresh or frozen cowpea leaves by methods suitable for large\u2010scale application\n70\n. The development of methods for the industrial\u2010scale production of plant\u2010derived vaccines will make an important contribution to the practical use of such material.",
