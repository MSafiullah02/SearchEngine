Quantitative analysis of infiltrating inflammatory cells revealed that the number of macrophages and T cells were similar in lesions of AE, CPE and SDE. In contrast to that, SDE lesions contained a significantly higher number of IgG+ B cells and plasma cells. In addition active demyelinating SDE lesions displayed an enhanced IgG content and deposits of complement C9. These results indicate that virus induced primary demyelination could be a consequence of antibody mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, a reduction in the number of cells producing spike protein in the chronic forms of the disease indicates down-regulation of this protein, possibly mediated by anti-S antibodies.",

We now present evidence that the pattern and cell tropism of virus infection closely correlates with the topographical distribution and cell specificity of tissue destruction in the CNS of infected animals. In addition, the expression of coronavirus S protein on the surface of infected cells in vivo as well as their reduced expression in chronic diseases and also the presence of IgG and complement C9 in actively demyelinating lesions suggests that antibodies against this viral protein may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic demyelinating lesions in this model.",

A milder and more chronic type of the disease was displayed by 21% of the rats, characterized by ruffled fur, an ataxic, trembling gait and paralysis of fore-or hindlegs several weeks to months post-inoculation.

Thus, this disease type differs from AE, which usually leads to death within 1 or 2 days in that it has a later onset and a milder and prolonged disease course.

We observed in this study extensive Schwann cell invasion and peripheral remyelination. As shown in demyelinating models based on intoxication, CNS remyelination cannot occur unless sufficient oligodendrocytes and probably also astrocytes are present (Ludwin, 1980; Blakemore & Crang, 1988) . In addition, it is known that invasion of Schwann cells is restricted to areas with astrocytic damage and destruction of the glial limiting membrane (Blakemore, 1978; Blakemore, Crang & Curtis, 1986) .

            "text": "Employing immune electron microscopic techniques, nucleocapsid protein was demonstrated lying free in the cytoplasm and S protein was shown to be associated with perinuclear cisterns, endoplasmic reticulum and vesicles. These findings are compatible with the subcellular distribution of the closely related MHV-A59 strain in cell cultures and with the known fact that coronaviruses bud into intracellular membrane compartments such as endoplasmic reticulum, smooth vesicles and Gold apparatus (Tooze, Tooze & Warren, 1984) . Furthermore, we found evidence that JHM S protein is expressed on the cell surface membrane of infected glial cells in vivo. Thus, spike protein is accessible to the humoral immune system. MHV-JHM infected rats generally do show a high virus specific (neutralizing) antibody response in the serum in the late phases of the disease (Koga et al., 1984; Wege et al., 198413) . Synthesis of antibodies with antiviral and unknown specificities was also shown to occur within the brain compartment (Sorensen et al., 1984; Dorries et al., 1986 Dorries et al., , 1987 . Consequently, it is conceivable that during stages of the disease which involve damage to the blood-brain barrier, infected cells might be destroyed through antibody-complement mediated cytotoxity or by antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxity (ADCC). Furthermore, recent immunosuppression studies have demonstrated that demyelination is not just simply due to cytolytic infection of oligodendrocytes (Wang et al., 1990) . MHC restricted cell mediated immune reaction against viral and myelin antigens may play a role in the establishment of a demyelinating disease Ehrlich, Matsushima & Stohlman, 1989; Wang et al., 1990) . However, the notion that an ADCC mechanism operates (in addition to a cell mediated immune response) is supported by the presence of plasma cells and of granular IgG and C9 deposits in actively demyelinating lesions of SDE. These deposits are similar to those described in co-transfer EAE models, in which lesions are induced by MBP reactive T cells in co-operation with monoclonal antibodies against MOG (Linington et af., 1988 (Linington et af., , 1989 .",

Neutralizing, S specific antibodies appear later and are important for subsequent protection. On the other hand, the results from our analysis of SDE lesions suggest that inflammatory demyelination could be the consequence of inefficient virus elimination during the clinically silent acute stage. The outcome of the disease in individual animals may depend on the balance between successful virus elimination, tissue destruction and down-regulation of virus production.",

The mechanism is unclear, but seems to be complex, as a simple masking or shedding of spike protein from the surface by antibodies would not account for the reduced intracellular expression. It is tempting to speculate that the virus down-regulates spike protein production in an attempt to escape from the immune reaction. In favour of this idea is the finding that in JHMinfected glial cell cultures, the presence of S specific antibodies promotes the establishment of a chronic infection and reduces the relative number of cells displaying S protein (Wege et al., 1989) . It has been shown in several viral systems, both in vivo and in vitro, that there is a reduced expression of glycoproteins on the cell surface during persistent infections relative to the levels during acute infections (Oldstone, 1989) .",
