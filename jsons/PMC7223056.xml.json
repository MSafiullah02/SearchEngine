Following discussions and votes conducted during several professional meetings under the auspices of ESICM and ESA in 2018, the expert panel outlined five clinical questions regarding treatment with noninvasive respiratory support techniques [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] for hypoxaemic patients with acute peri-operative/periprocedural respiratory failure:What (realistic) goals of therapy (i.e. outcomes) are to be expected when using these types of support?Which patient populations may benefit from the use of these types of support?What minimal standards of haemodynamic and respiratory monitoring and what laboratory and radiological tests are required during the support period?How can the complications of these types of support be prevented?Where should treatment with these types of support be initiated (i.e. location) and using what device settings?",

During the process of this guideline creation, the chair of the panel and the methodologist organised and undertook several lectures and electronic-communications for the panel members on how to grade and assess evidence, and adequately address the risk of bias. All recommendations have been reviewed and monitored from the infant stages until the final steps by our methodologist and chair of the guideline committee. These recommendations were subject to voting and discussions by all members of the panel until full agreement was reached for every single recommendation. When in doubt and in cases of disagreement, as in the ESA guideline committee policy, the methodologist and chair of the guideline committee (AA) had the final say in regard to grading. His assessment was subject to an \u2018external\u2019 review by another methodologist (MH). None of the methodologists have any conflicts of interests. The chair of the guideline panel (ML) had no conflict of interest in relation to this guideline.",

The two studies are dissimilar in the type of support provided (CPAP in one [14] and NIPPV in the other [12]) and in the indication for NIPPV (therapeutic in one [12] and prophylactic in the other [14]), which probably explains the difference in the rate of complications observed in the two trials [12, 14]. Taken together, the results of these two trials support the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques in a large group of patients after upper abdominal surgery.",

Another non-inferiority trial that randomised patients (38% of them surgical) at high risk of post-extubation respiratory failure to treatment with either HFNC or NIPPV via a facemask found more damage to the nasal mucosa and skin with NIPPV (42.9% vs. 0%, P < 0.001). These complications required discontinuation for 25% or more of the per-protocol time (18 h) [28]. A two-centre study that randomised patients with PaO2:FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 40 kPa (300 mmHg) immediately before extubation to receive either COT or HFNC noted that with HFNC the rate of interface displacement was lower (32% vs. 56%, P = 0.01) and there were less oxygen desaturations (40% vs. 75%, P < 0.001) [43]. Conversely, a trial which randomised patients at high risk of post-operative pulmonary complications undergoing major abdominal surgery to receive either COT or HFNC found no difference between the two in terms of discomfort between groups [21].",

            "text": "\nMost studies have compared a noninvasive respiratory support technique (NIPPV, CPAP and HFNC) with COT. Head-to head-comparisons are scarce.There is also no information regarding surgical complications in peri-operative/periprocedural patients. This is a particularly relevant question after upper abdominal surgery. Noninvasive ventilation with high pressures has traditionally been contraindicated after major gastric and oesophageal surgery due to the theoretical risk of gastric dilatation and disruption of surgical anastomoses. Faria et al. [22] reported that NIPPV may be considered in patients with acute respiratory failure after oesophageal surgery, when the insufflation pressure level was less than 12 cmH2O and air leaks were absent. However, this statement was based on only three prospective studies [12, 20, 51].Another issue that requires further investigation is the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques outside the ICU in the periprocedural/peri-operative period. Only one RCT compared patients treated with CPAP with those treated with COT on the ward [23]. Yet surveys reveal that noninvasive respiratory support techniques are routinely used in wards [52] and that nurses in such wards feel inadequately informed about the management of noninvasive respiratory support techniques [53]. The decision to use noninvasive ventilation techniques outside the ICU very much depends on the expertise and means available locally. However, it is important to further study this practice in the context of patient safety.Finally, there is a need to elucidate the means of improving patient and noninvasive respiratory support device interface.\n",
