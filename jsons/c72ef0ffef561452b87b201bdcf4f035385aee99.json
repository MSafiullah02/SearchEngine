Considering the rapid outbreak in China and fast worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, this infectious disease has aroused emerging global concerns. As of March 29, 2020, 82419 people have been diagnosed as COVID-19 in China, among them 3306 ended up with death. Moreover, 582131 people worldwide were infected, and the mortality rate was 4.7%. As there are currently no standardized treatments and medications available, it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis for COVID-19 patients.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] A recent research has exhibited that severe cases of COVID-19 tended to have higher NLR. 6 Whether NLR could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients needs to be further elucidated. So far researches of COVID-19 are focused on the epidemiology and clinical features of the patients, [7] [8] [9] information regarding risk factors of mortality is scarce. In the present study, we aim to investigate whether the NLR can serve as a valuable predictor of in-hospital mortality.",

The overall number of inhospital death was 33 (13.47%). Table 1 compared the baseline demographic, clinical, and biochemical characteristics of included patients by tertiles of the NLR. Compared with subjects in the lowest tertile of the NLR, those in the highest tertile were older, more likely to be male. The most common symptoms on admission of patients in the highest tertile were fever and dry cough, followed by fatigue and poor appetite. Moreover, individuals in the highest tertile were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic liver disease and carcinoma. The incidence of in-hospital death significantly increased across NLR tertiles (2.44% vs. 6.17% vs. 31.71% for tertile 1 vs. tertile 2 vs. tertile 3, respectively). Table 2 showed the univariate logistic regression models between baseline variables and death. The univariate analysis indicated that age (OR = 1.09, 95% CI, 1.06-1. The results of univariate and multivariate logistic regression models assessing the relations of NLR and in-hospital mortality were shown in Table 3 . In the unadjusted model, the ORs of death significantly augmented as the NLR increased and the tertiles of NLR upgraded. There was a 10% increase in risk of in-hospital mortality for per unit increase in NLR (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.14; P < 0.0 0 01). The OR for tertile 3 was significantly higher than the OR for tertile 1 (OR = 18.57; 95% CI, 4.24 to 81.44; P = 0.0 0 01). Adjustment for demographic variables and comorbidities did not weaken the associations between the NLR and death. Further adjusting for the baseline levels of respiratory rate, alanine transaminase, creatinine, prothrombin time and D-dimer did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models. NLR as a continuous variable was associated with 8% increased risk of mortality in the fully adjusted models (OR = 1.08; 95%CI, 1.01 to 1.14; P = 0.0147). Meanwhile, elevated tertile of NLR exhibited an increase in risk of mortality for the third tertile (vs the first tertile) with OR of 16.04 (95% CI, 1.14 to 224.95; P = 0.0395).",

This finding is consistent with the results concluded by Mo P et al. 14 that male patients have a higher incidence of disease refractoriness. Further research should be conducted to confirm this result and determine the differences in the pathophysiological mechanisms between male and female with COVID-19.",

The high NLR results from increased neutrophil count and decreased lymphocyte count. The inflammatory response could stimulate the production of neutrophils and speed up the apoptosis of lymphocytes. responses and consequently immunologic abnormality are believed to play remarkable roles in the severity of virus-induced disease. 16 When immune response is dysregulated, it would result in an excessive inflammation, even death. One of the most prominent factors associating with the severity and outcomes of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease is the hematological change in leukocyte populations. 17 leukocytosis characterized by increased neutrophils and monocytes was primarily observed in several MERS-CoV patients, and all the deceased patients showed rapid drops of lymphocyte counts. 18 , 19 Recent studies showed that higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and NLR in infected patients were correlated with the severity of the disease than did those non-severe patients, suggesting the involvement of cytokine storm in disease Data are mean \u00b1 SD, n (%), n/N (%), or median (IQR).

Furthermore, patients with severe virus infection are more likely to co-infected with bacteria due to low immune functions, which would be another possible reason to explain the increased level of neutrophils, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin shown in our study.",

Since NLR could be quickly calculated based on a blood routine test on admission, clinicians may identify high risk COVID-19 patients at an early stage.

We adopted strict methods of statistical adjustment to minimize potential confounding.
