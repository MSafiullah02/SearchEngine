            "text": "Nidoviruses have quite distinctive replication and transcription processes compared with other single-stranded, plus-strand RNA viruses and feature the most complex genomic organization (Pasternak et al., 2006, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). There are four family members in the order Nidovirales, which includes coronavirus, torovirus, arterivirus and ronivirus (Pasternak et al., 2006). Nidoviruses cause a variety of infectious diseases, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in humans, which gripped the attention of the world in 2003, is the member of coronaviridae (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). There are also severe nidoviral diseases in animals, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Cavanagh, 1997, Snijder, 2001), which is a member of the family Arteriviridae together with equine arteritis virus (EAV), simian hemohagic fever virus (SHFV), and the lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus of mice (LDV) (den Boon et al., 1991, Pasternak et al., 2006, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). Since 2006, massive outbreaks of highly pathogenic PRRSV have overwhelmed the swine industry in China and its neighboring countries (Lv et al., 2008, Tian et al., 2007, Zhou and Yang, 2010). Despite massive efforts have been directed towards prevention and control of PRRS, little improvement has been shown and the latter is still the biggest threat to the swine industry, particularly in developing countries. One of the reasons for such ineffective PRRS control is that many puzzles remain unearthed for PRRSV biology.",

            "text": "PRRSV genome has a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 poly (A) tail and is \u223c15 kb in length. There are at least nine open reading frames (ORFs), flanked by the 5\u2032 UTR, 3\u2032 UTR, respectively, which are believed to play pivotal regulatory roles in PRRSV life cycle (Sun et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2007, Verheije et al., 2001, Verheije et al., 2002). Like other nidoviruses, PRRSV generates a 3\u2032 co-terminal nested set of subgenomic mRNA (sg mRNA) to produce structural proteins. PRRSV sg mRNAs also contain a common 5\u2032 leader sequence, which comes from the genomic 5\u2032 end (Pasternak et al., 2006, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). The sg mRNA synthesis involves a process of unique discontinuous RNA transcription similar with the RNA recombination (Pasternak et al., 2006, van Marle et al., 1999). During the process of discontinuous RNA transcription, the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) plays a crucial role by base-pairing interaction between body TRS (TRS-B) and Leader TRS (TRS-L) during the synthesis of minus-strand RNA (Pasternak et al., 2006, Pasternak et al., 2001, Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995). The TRS-Bs in the genome would act as attenuation signals for minus-strand RNA synthesis, after which the nascent minus strand, having an anti TRS-B at its 3\u2032 end, would be guided to the 5\u2032-proximal region of the template, through a base-pairing interaction with the TRS-L. Following the addition of the anti-leader to the nascent minus strands, the sg-length minus strands would serve as templates for transcription. However, many molecular details for such a unique transcription process remain to be investigated. In particular, what are the roles of the TRS-flanking sequences and/or local or genomic global RNA structures? Dose Arteriviral RNA synthesis also requires cross-talk between the genomic termini, as described for other positive-strand RNA viruses (Filomatori et al., 2006, Suzuki et al., 2008)?",

            "text": "In this study, reverse genetic study was conducted on a type II PRRSV infectious cDNA clone pAPRRS, which was dually controlled by both CMV promoter and T7 promoter (Yuan and Wei, 2008). The in vitro RNA transcripts from T7 promoter were utilized to investigate if presence of the authentic 5\u2032-terminal nucleotide sequence was required, while in vivo RNA transcripts from CMV promoter were intended for sequence specificity and/or structural RNA signal studies. Serial truncations of the 5\u2032-proximal end of pAPRRS were performed. In the RNA-launched reverse genetics system (RGS), we found that the first 3 nucleotides (1AUG3) at the very beginning of PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR were dispensable for virus viability, yet the deleted nucleotides were repaired with different sequences. In the DNA-launch system, we demonstrated that the first 16 nucleotides, 1AUGACGUAUAGGUGUU16, of PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR could be altered by a combination of deletion and substitution in the in vivo RNA transcripts. However, the altered sequences were repaired with a variable length and largely AU-rich exogenous sequences in the rescued viruses. Surprisingly, in all cases the reverted AU-rich sequences were found to restore the original stem\u2013loop 1 (SL1) structure of the PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR. Moreover, the infectivity of the transfected DNAs were found to be directly related to the presence of the SL1, which was probably a key for the initiation of PRRSV process. We therefore concluded that the structural RNA elements rather than primary sequences of the 5\u2032-terminus of the PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR played more important regulatory roles in virus replication process.",

As shown in Fig. 1, pAPRRS was driven by both the human cytomegalovirus immediately early promoter (CMV) and T7 promoter (T7), with which either \u201cDNA-launched\u201d or \u201cRNA-launched\u201d reverse genetics can be conducted (Yuan and Wei, 2008). In general, the desired mutations were included in the synthetic forward primers (Table 1). A series of mutant full-length cDNA clones with 5\u2032-terminal authentic sequences of 5\u2032 UTR deleted were constructed. Upon verified by restriction endonuclease mapping and nucleotide sequencing, these full-length mutant plasmids were named as pAPRRSD1, D3, D4, D5, D6, pAPRRSM1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, M10, M11, M12, M13, M14, M15, M16, M17, M18, M19, M20, M21, M22, M23, M44, M68, M99, M190, Mzg3 and Mzg6, of which the representative plasmids are drawn in Fig. 1. All the mutants were divided into three groups. Mutant cDNA clones of group I were intended to be used as templates for in vitro genomic RNA synthesis, by T7 DNA-dependant RNA polymerases in the RNA-launched form. On the other hand, group II and group III, controlled under CMV promoter, were directly transfected into cells in a form of DNA-launched RGS. Moreover, the T7 promoter was substituted as GC-rich sequences in pAPRRSMzg3 and pAPRRSMzg6. As shown in Fig. 1, the transcription initiation site of CMV promoter was located in the T7 promoter if DNA-launched transfection was used, thus the in vivo synthesized RNA genomes contained 9 extra foreign nucleotides (CAC UAU AGG) immediately before the viral sequence.",

Stinski. The mutant plasmids were transfected into BHK-21 cells. At 24 hpt, IFA was performed for detecting PRRSV N protein expression as described above. Fig. 3A reveales that N protein was detected with deletions that was up to 18 nucleotides in pAPRRSM18 (IFA results for pAPRRSM1 through M12 were not shown, due to page limit). Mutant plasmids containing more than 18 nucleotides deletion, as well as the nonreplicative control pAS, were negative even after prolonged incubation for 7 dpt, and three subsequent blind passages. Moreover, the expression level of N protein was invertedly correlated to the number of the nucleotides deleted, and only a few secluded spots were found in pAPRRSM17 and M18 transfected wells (Fig. 3). In addition, IFA with anti-Nsp2 antibody results revealed that all mutants including pAPRRSM190 containing no leader sequence at all, expressed Nsp2 protein, which was translated from the CMV-driven genomic RNAs (data not shown). Again, the expression level were different, with mutants containing more than 16 nucleotide deletion only displayed sparse positive cells, implying that the first 16 nucleotides could have a role for virus replication.",

To test the infectivity of deletion mutants, the supernatant of the transfected BHK-21 cells at 48 hpt was harvested for titration in MARC-145 cells. The viral titers were gradually decreasing along with the deletion number of the 5\u2032 proximal nucleotides. The viral titers of mutant vAPRRSM15 and M16 were the two lowest among them, was 1 \u00d7 100.5\n TCID50\n mL\u22121 and 1 \u00d7 100.33\n TCID50\n mL\u22121, \u223c1500-fold and \u223c2200-fold lower than 1 \u00d7 103.67\n TCID50\n mL\u22121 of WT, respectively (Fig. 4A).

Multi-step growth curves revealed that the virus yield was decreased for all of the deletion mutants, especially in the earlier phase. However, the peak titer at 72 hpi difference became smaller than that in the earlier phase (Fig. 4C), suggesting that there might be restoration of virus infectivity during such multiple cycles of infection compared with the viral titer of the first cycle, as shown in Fig. 4A.

We next assessed the possible effects of the sequence truncations and alterations to the putative structures of the PRRSV 5\u2032 proximal sequences. The predicted secondary structure of 5\u2032 terminal 246 nucleotides of APRRSV was shown in Fig. 6\n. A total of 6 stem\u2013loops were predicted and verified by multiple Algorithms. The overall secondary structure was dramatically changed when the first 12 nucleotides \u201c1ATGACGTATAGG12\u201d were deleted in pAPRRSM12 (Fig. 6Ai). In particular, the original stem\u2013loop 1 (SL1) was replaced with two minor stem\u2013loops. However, the filling-in by the T7 promoter sequence restored the SL1-like structure, though the sequence is different (Fig. 6Aii). Surprisingly, all of the sequences in the recovered viable viruses were found to form a SL1-like structure, as represented by that of vAPRRSM12S1 (Fig. 6Aiii). We then analysed the nucleotide deletion and substitution in pAPRRSMzg6. Pure deletion of the first 6 nucleotides would disrupt both SL-1 and SL-2 (Fig. 6Bi). However, filling-in by T7 promoter and an artificial GC-rich sequence restored both stem\u2013loops (Fig. 6Bii). Again, all recovered viruses displayed the similar structures, though with different sequence (Fig. 6Biii). Furthermore, we investigated the failure of vAPRRSM17 to initiate virus production, and found that the filling-in by T7 sequences after deletion of the first 17 nucleotides was not enough to restore the SL1 structure. Overall, we concluded that the SL1, and probably SL2, structure rather than the primary sequence is important for viral infectivity.",

The first RNA-launched PRRSV RGS was performed for the type 1 Lelystad strain (Meulenberg et al., 1998) by assembling its full-length cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter in the low-copy-number plasmid pOK12. Identical strategies were also previously used in the construction of an infectious cDNA for the North American prototypic VR-2332 strain (Nielsen et al., 2003). In this study, we utilized an infectious cDNA clone pAPPRS that are dually controlled by CMV and T7 promoter (Yuan and Wei, 2008), which offered us more flexibilities for investigating the roles of 5\u2032 UTR in the forms of both in vitro and in vivo synthetic genomic RNAs. As the results, we found that the first 16 nucleotides in the PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR could be altered without lethal effect to virus infectivity, which is 9 nt longer than that previously reported by Choi et al. (2006). Intriguingly, only 3 nts could be deleted without loss of the viral viability in our RNA-launched system, despite three independent transfections were conducted, and the 4 nt deletion was always lethal for virus recovery. The difference between our observation and that by Choi et al. (2006) may be explained by the genetic diversity between the APRRS and PL97, as only 93.4% identity exist, and 96.3% of 5\u2032 UTR. It may be possible that the long-range RNA\u2013RNA interaction and/or the global genomic high-ordered structure were adversely affected by deletion of more nucleotides in APRRS. Alternatively, we found that the SL1 structure was disrupted in the pAPRRSD4, which may be one of the reasons for this lethal mutation.",

Besides acting as RNA signals, high-ordered RNA structure has been confirmed to protect viral RNAs from degradation by exonucleases (Gallie, 1998), and stabilize the genomic RNA (Barton et al., 2001). In our DNA-launched study here, we found that the infectivity of the mutants was directly related to the presence of the SL1, and the lack of which by insufficient substitution, e.g., pAPRRSM17, would render the failure of virus recovery. In fact, both SL1 and SL2 were disrupted in this 17 nt deletion mutant. The viral titration for the first cycle and multiple cycles of mutant viruses were conducted in this study. The viral titers were gradually decreasing along with the deletion number of the 5\u2032 proximal nucleotides. But multi-step growth curve revealed that the peak titer of mutant viruses at 72 hpi difference was small, as shown in Fig. 4A and C. According to the exogenous AU-rich sequence detection and secondary structure prediction, it could be deduced that virus viability restoration occurred in viral SL1 structure restoration and stability. The fact that the first 16 nts could be altered without loss of the virus infectivity led us to conclude that the structural RNA, at least SL1, rather than the primary sequence at the PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR was crucial for virus replication. Moreover, all viable viruses acquired nucleotide sequences that invariably restored the SL1 structure, as represented in Fig. 6.",

To differentiate if the repaired 5\u2032 end is template-dependent, we modified the T7 sequence as GC-rich immediately behind the CMV transcription initiation site (Fig. 1, group III). Surprisingly, both rescued viruses, vAPRRSMzg3 and vAPRRSMzg6, were again repaired with AU-rich, indicating that viral genomic end repair is template-independent. At this stage, it was difficult to explain the origin of these novel 5\u2032 foreign sequences and the molecular mechanism of their addition at the very beginning of the viral genome. It is likely that they are acquired from cellular RNAs via a process of RNA recombination involving template switching during either negative- or positive-sense RNA synthesis, as has been described for pestivirus (Meulenberg et al., 1993) and poliovirus (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986). Alternatively, the nucleotides were randomly added to the genomic end during RNA synthesis, and the AU-rich sequence containing viruses were selected for their overall better fitness. The selective pressure could come from the sequence requirement for local or long-range RNA\u2013RNA and/or RNA\u2013protein interactions. For instance, the viral RdRp binding site at the 5\u2032 end of the Dengue virus genome facilitates template recognition at the 3\u2032 end of the genome via long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions (Filomatori et al., 2007). In addition, the overall high-ordered structures of the 5\u2032 UTR or the genomic RNA possibly play a role in the end-repair process, which is supported by our finding that the SL1 is invariably maintained for virus recovery.",

            "text": "The 5\u2032 UTR of plus-strand RNA viruses has also documented for multiple functions that regulate the viral life cycles, including genomic RNA translation, replication, subgenomic mRNA (if any) transcription, progeny genome encapsidation (Andino et al., 1990, Choi et al., 2006, Frolov et al., 1998, Herold and Andino, 2001, Liu et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2009, Suzuki et al., 2008, Van Den Born et al., 2004, Van Den Born et al., 2005). In this study, we found that all in vitro and in vivo synthetic genomic RNAs including pAPRRSM190 in which all 5\u2032 UTR sequence was deleted were positive for Nsp2 protein expression by IFA (data not shown), demonstrating that the PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR has little effect on genomic RNA translation. These results confirmed the finding by the Snijder group showing that none of the EAV 5\u2032 UTR sequence or structure played any role in regulating viral RNA translation (Van Den Born et al., 2005). This is not unexpectedly because that nidoviral mRNA translation adopt a leaky-scanning model, while there was probably internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) as those in 5\u2032 UTR of a variety of positive-strand RNA viruses (Rijnbrand et al., 1997). However, our IFA results showed that the N protein was not expressed in transfected cells by deletion of the first 19 or more nucleotides, which could be a result of the lack of mRNA7. In addition, our preliminary analyses suggested that the nonviable mutants contained no minus- and probablly plus-strand genomic RNAs. Van Den Born et al. (2005) reported that nt 1\u2013135 in the EAV 5\u2032 UTR had little role in subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Therefore, we think that the PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR SL1 structure could be an element controlling genomic RNA synthesis.",
