            "text": "Background and objective Acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) regulates the differentiation of Th1, Th2, Th17 cells and Treg cells, which play a critical role in airway inflammation of asthma. Here we investigated the role of ACC in the pathogenesis of asthma. Methods Chicken Ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged mice were divided into three groups, PBS group, DMSO (solvent of TOFA) group and ACC inhibitor 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid (TOFA) + DMSO group. Airway inflammation was assessed with histology, percentages of CD4 + T cell subsets in lung and spleen was assessed with flow cytometry, and airway responsiveness was assessed with FinePointe RC system. The expression of characteristic transcription factors of CD4 + T cell subsets was evaluated with real-time PCR. Cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum was determined with ELISA. Results In asthma mice, the expression of ACC increased, while the expression of phosphorylated ACC (pACC) decreased. TOFA had no significant effect on pACC expression. TOFA reduced serum IgE, airway inflammatory cells infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia, but dramatically increased airway responsiveness. TOFA significantly reduced the percentages of Th1, Th2, Th17 cells in lung and spleen, the expression of GATA3 and ROR\u03b3t in lung, and IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-17A levels in BALF and serum. TOFA had no significant effect on the percentage of Treg cells, IL-10 level and the expression of T-bet and Foxp3. Conclusion Acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor TOFA might have a distinct effect on asthmatic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness.",

Two isoforms of ACC were identified, ACC1 and ACC2 [3] . Malonyl-CoA synthesized by ACC1 serves as a carbon donor for de novo fatty acid synthesis, whereas malonyl-CoA produced by ACC2 works as an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation [4] . ACC is rapidly inactivated upon phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or cAMPdependent protein kinase A (PKA), whereas dephosphorylation activates the enzyme [5] . Besides, ACC can also be regulated promptly by allosteric agents, such as Soraphen A, which more likely targets ACC1, and 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic acid (TOFA), which more likely targets both ACC1 and ACC2 [6, 7] .",

Treg cells are responsible for sustaining immune tolerance to allergen, decreased or defected suppressing effects of Treg cells also contribute to the development of allergic asthma [15] .

As shown in Fig. 2 , the protein expression of ACC was higher in lung of asthma model of mice when compared to that of control mice. By contrast, the protein expression of pACC in lung of asthma model of mice was lower than that in control mice. This protein expression pattern of ACC and pACC suggests a possible role of ACC in asthma. TOFA is a cell-permeable small molecule and also an allosteric inhibitor of ACC. We found that TOFA treatment slightly decreased ACC protein expression in the lung of asthma model of mice. The solvent DMSO had no effects on ACC protein expression (Fig. 2a) . However, neither TOFA nor DMSO displayed significant effects on pACC protein expression in lung of asthma model of mice, albeit there was a slight trend of increase in pACC expression in TOFA-treated asthma model of mice (Fig. 2b) . Our results suggest that TOFA may reduce the activity of ACC primarily by allosteric effect, but not by phosphorylation of ACC, at least in lung of asthma model of mice.",

Since Th17 induces neutrophil-dominant airway inflammation, a mice model of asthma characterized by neutrophil-dominant inflammation, e.g., mice exposed to ovalbumin and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), will give more information about the effect of TOFA. In fact, recent study showed that HDM induced both Th2 and Th17 cytokine profile and mixture of eosinophilic and neutrophilic airway inflammation [37] ; therefore, effects of TOFA should be conducted with HDM-induced airway inflammation.",
