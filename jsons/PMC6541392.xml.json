Moreover, they have attracted major interest in oncology and multiple sclerosis as biological response modifiers able to improve therapy [1]. However, although type I IFNs have been approved for diverse indications including genital warts, viral hepatitis, hairy cell leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, their use in the clinic is limited due to the frequent and severe adverse effects (including flu-like disease and depression) they exhibit.",

Similarly to type I IFNs, IFN\u03bbs are triggered by infection and induce multiple antiviral responses mediating viral clearance. They also exert pleiotropic effects on the immune system, many of which highly reminiscent to these of type I IFNs. This raised the question whether IFN\u03bbs and type I IFNs are redundant, and why our organism needs two IFN-based antiviral defense systems to confront infection. Here, we review the latest evidence highlighting the primacy of IFN\u03bbs in antimicrobial, and in particular antiviral, immunity. We survey their unique and common biology with type I IFNs, their co-operation with type I IFNs in the fine-tuning of antimicrobial immunity and their emerging role in damage control. We also discuss their potential as novel therapeutics that exhibit the beneficial effects, but lack the pro-inflammatory activities causing side effects, of type I IFNs.",

            "text": "Central to IFN\u03bb production are pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR5, TLR7/8 and TLR9, RIG-I and MDA-5 which trigger a downstream signaling cascade leading to the activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Accordingly, IFN\u03bb genes have binding sites for NF-\u03baB, IRF1, IRF3 and IRF7 in their promoter regions similarly to type I IFNs [2,3,12]. Although this would suggest co-regulation, this is often not the case; IFN\u03bbs exhibit a restricted pattern of expression compared to type I IFNs which are almost ubiquitously expressed. IFN\u03bbs are most abundant at barrier surfaces including the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and can be robustly produced by epithelia and epithelial-origin cells including hepatocytes and some immune cells [10,11,13,14]. This goes beyond the ability of all cells to respond to PRR engagement, suggesting the existence of additional cell-specific epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of IFN\u03bb production. For example, RIG-I-like receptor signaling through mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) in peroxisomes [15], sensing through the cytosolic DNA sensor Ku70 [16], induction of the transcriptional co-activator Med23 [17] or presence of transcriptional repressors such as ZEB1 and BLIMP-1 [18,19] have all been associated with IFN\u03bb production. Whether such mechanisms can broadly account for IFN\u03bb expression patterns remains to be established.",

IFNLR1 confers ligand specificity and enables receptor assembly, while IL10R2 is shared with IL-10 family members and is required for signaling. Binding of IFN\u03bb to IFNLR1 and IL10R2 occurs at a 1:1:1 stoichiometry compared to the 2:1:1 ratio between IL-10, IL10R1 and IL10R2 [20\u2022]. IFNLR stimulation leads to the activation of the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and TYK2, and the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 which bind to IRF9, forming the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex [2,3]. ISGF3 then enters the nucleus and induces the transcription of hundreds of genes, termed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), that generally inhibit viral replication and spread, and exhibit broad antimicrobial functions against viral, bacterial and parasitic infections [21]. Notably, this pathway is also shared with type I IFNs, highlighting the very similar antiviral activity these two systems exhibit [22, 23, 24]. Thus, it has been difficult to segregate IFN\u03bb from type I IFN functional or transcriptional responses, with IFN\u03bb-induced genes typically representing a subset of all genes elicited by type I IFNs but exhibiting a delayed peak and longer duration [23, 24, 25, 26].",

            "text": "The most striking difference between the two IFN systems is their receptor distribution. The type I IFN receptor is expressed in almost all cell types. On the contrary, the IFNLR1/IL10RB complex is expressed primarily in cells of epithelial origin and few immune cells, mainly neutrophils and subsets of dendritic cells (DCs), conferring selective IFN\u03bb responsiveness to them. This has been demonstrated for both mouse [27\u2022,28\u2022\u2022,29\u2022\u2022] and human neutrophils [29\u2022\u2022] and plasmacytoid DC (pDCs) [11,30], as well as human monocyte-derived DC [31,32], and mouse bone marrow-derived or lung-sorted conventional DC (cDC) of the DC2 phenotype [33] (Figure 1\n). The expression pattern of the receptors largely follows that of their ligands with human and mouse epithelial cells [2,3,13,28\u2022\u2022,34], pDCs [10,11,30,35,36], DC1 [37] and DC2 [11,28\u2022\u2022,36,38] cells, as well as human monocyte-derived DC [31,32,38,39] and macrophages [34,38,40] expressing high levels of IFN\u03bbs upon activation. This points to more specialized roles for IFN\u03bbs in localized immune responses at epithelial barrier surfaces conferred by epithelial and immune cells. However, subtler differences also exist. For example, JAK2 phosphorylation is induced only by IFN\u03bbs but not type I IFNs [15], while other less well-described pathways may also be important for antiviral functions [41\u2022\u2022], indicating the existence of distinct signalling events that remain to be characterized.",

            "text": "From the very first publications describing the discovery of IFN\u03bbs, it became evident that IFN\u03bbs exhibit potent antiviral activity [2,3]. Treatment of infected cells in culture or experimental animals with recombinant IFN\u03bbs has been effective against a very diverse range of viruses [42, 43, 44]. However, endogenous non-redundant roles of IFN\u03bbs that are not compensated by type I IFNs have been difficult to establish. Important progress has recently come from the study of gastrointestinal infections where it was shown that cell responsiveness to IFN\u03bbs is largely compartmentalized with IFN\u03bbs acting on intestinal epithelial cells (expressing high levels of IFNLR1) and having minimal effects on lamina propria cells (expressing low levels), while type I IFNs exhibiting the opposite effects [45,46\u2022\u2022]. Accordingly, it was demonstrated that rotavirus \u2014 which infects epithelial cells \u2014 is solely controlled by IFN\u03bbs while reovirus -which replicates in both epithelial and non-epithelial cells and can spread systemically- requires the co-operative action of IFN\u03bbs with type I IFNs [45,46\u2022\u2022,47\u2022]. Similarly, norovirus that grows at the gastrointestinal epithelium but spreads systemically is confronted by both IFN systems [48\u2022\u2022]. Interestingly, IFN\u03bbs can effectively clear norovirus in antibiotics-treated mice, an effect prohibited by gut commensals [49\u2022], adding another level of complexity to the equation.",

            "text": "In the respiratory tract, such compartmentalization is less obvious. Respiratory epithelial cells express receptors for and respond to both types of IFNs, as do certain immune cell populations residing or infiltrating the lung. Moreover, although nose, bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells express high levels of IFN\u03bbs following infection [34,50], smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and DCs can also do so [10,11,51,52]. This suggested a degree of redundancy between the two IFN systems, supported by early work showing increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections in mice deficient in both IFNLR1 and IFNAR1, but not in mice deficient in only IFNLR1 [23,53,54]. However, more recent studies have uncovered major and unique roles of IFN\u03bbs in antiviral immunity in the lung. They have revealed that IFN\u03bbs are induced first, at lower viral burden than type I IFNs, and act to limit initial infection spread [28\u2022\u2022]. This is possibly due to the propensity of airway epithelial cells to selectively produce type III IFNs [23,55]. In line with that, it has been reported that IFN\u03bbs are essential for preventing virus transmission from the upper airways to the lungs, a process that takes place early during infection [56\u2022\u2022]. Interestingly, IFN\u03bbs lack the strong pro-inflammatory effects of type I IFNs and are rather anti-inflammatory and tissue protective. As a result, IFNLR1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit increased viral load, inflammation and host damage following infection [28\u2022\u2022], whereas recombinant IFN\u03bb2 treatment potently suppresses these outcomes [57]. This is also the case when mice are treated with IFN\u03bb2/3 neutralizing antibodies [58]. These data support a model where IFN\u03bbs confer initial antiviral protection without provoking unnecessary inflammation, while type I IFNs come into play as a second line of defense to enhance antiviral responses at the expense of collateral damage (Figure 2\n).",

Interestingly, this is attributed to the ability of human hepatocytes to preferentially generate and respond to IFN\u03bbs similarly to respiratory epithelial cells [60].

L. monocytogenes, S. enterica and S. sonnei as well as several bacterial ligands induce IFN\u03bbs [7,9\u2022], mainly in a MyD88-dependent manner [9\u2022]. This is functionally important. in vitro, IFN\u03bbs enhanced epithelial barrier integrity, preventing bacterial dissemination [9\u2022]. In vivo, in models of S. aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, IFNLR1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited lower bacterial loads and less pathology, although inflammatory cell infiltration was not affected [62]. Also, intranasal infection of IFNLR1\u2212/\u2212 mice with S. aureus led to significantly increased bacterial clearance and, at the same time, decreased proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2 in the airways [63]. Interestingly, in this study IL-1\u03b2 production appeared to be regulated by proteases released by neutrophils rather than NLRP3 and capsase-1 activation. Moreover, in a model of invasive aspergillosis with Aspergillus fumigatus, IFNLR1\u2212/\u2212 mice developed aggravated disease, with higher fungal loads in the lungs and more severe fungal invasion [64\u2022\u2022]. This was largely due to IFN\u03bb-mediated STAT1 activation in neutrophils, that was shown to protect the host. Further studies are therefore needed to shed light into the wider role of IFN\u03bbs in antimicrobial defenses beyond viral infections.",

            "text": "A primary emerging activity of IFN\u03bbs is the regulation of innate immunity. Contrary to type I IFNs, IFN\u03bbs suppress innate pro-inflammatory responses and limit the host damaging effects associated with inflammation. This is largely due to their selective action on neutrophils, preventing their pro-inflammatory activation and functions. Thus, in the context of influenza viral infection, IFN\u03bbs restrain the production of TNF, IL-1\u03b2 and other tissue destructive mediators from neutrophils, while allowing effective antiviral responses to develop [28\u2022\u2022]. Although it is unclear whether this is a direct effect, it nevertheless shows that IFN\u03bbs are critically involved in keeping inflammation under control and limiting collateral damage. In the context of chronic intestinal inflammation, IFN\u03bbs act directly on neutrophils to inhibit the generation of ROS and their degranulation through a process mediated by JAK2 [29\u2022\u2022]. IFN\u03bbs can also induce additional beneficial effects by accelerating mucosal healing [65\u2022]. Exogenous administration of recombinant IFN\u03bbs in experimental animal models with influenza virus infection or colitis has further confirmed their regulatory and anti-inflammatory activity, and has highlighted their therapeutic potential [29\u2022\u2022,57]. Moreover, exogenous administration of recombinant IFN\u03bbs has shown therapeutic potential in other diseases where IFN\u03bbs may not be produced naturally such as collagen-induced arthritis [27\u2022] and arterial thrombosis [66\u2022\u2022]. In arthritis, the efficacy of IFN\u03bb treatment was attributed to the inhibitory effects of IFN\u03bbs in neutrophil migration [27\u2022]. In arterial thrombosis, IFN\u03bb-mediated protection was due to the suppressive effects of IFN\u03bbs on neutrophil-extracellular traps (NETs) formation [66\u2022\u2022]. This anti-inflammatory or immune-modulatory behavior of IFN\u03bbs is reminiscent of the activity of IL-10 with which IFN\u03bbs share sequence homology and the IL10RB subunit for signaling (Figure 3\n).",

            "text": "Another major activity of IFN\u03bbs is the regulation of adaptive immunity. IFN\u03bbs signal on DC2 cells [31, 32, 33] and pDCs [11,30], of both human and mouse origin, and modulate their function. in vitro, IFN\u03bbs enhance the propensity of human monocyte-derived DCs to generate Foxp3+ regulatory T cells [31,32]. in vivo, IFN\u03bbs suppress the ability of mouse DC2 cells to induce T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 differentiation, and enhance Th1 cell development [33]. This is consistent with cell culture studies using mouse DC2 and T cells [33], or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [67]. Interestingly, a SNP in the Ifnl3 locus (rs8099917) is linked to higher IFN\u03bb3 production and Th1 skewing following PBMC stimulation with influenza virus [68]. A shift in IFN\u03b3 production from NK cells is also observed but this might be indirect as neither NK cells [11,13] nor T cells [11,33] seem to respond to IFN\u03bbs. The Th1 skewing effect of IFN\u03bbs may be related to their capacity to increase the expression of the Th1 polarizing cytokine IL-12 in a context-dependent manner [33,69]. Noteworthy, cytotoxic T cell responses may also be affected by IFN\u03bbs as increased CD8+ T cell responses have been reported in IFNLR1\u2212/\u2212 mice following acute LCMV infection [70].",

In allergic asthma, IFN\u03bbs potently suppress the activation of Th2 and Th17 responses, and the development of immunopathology [33]. In autoimmune arthritis, they also inhibit the induction of Th17 and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell responses and they ameliorate disease [27\u2022]. IFN\u03bbs therefore appear to be broadly protective, in both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, mediating immune modulatory actions aiming at restoring immunological balance and limiting direct tissue damage caused by the byproducts of host defense (Figure 4\n).",
