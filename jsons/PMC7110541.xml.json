Samples MO008 and MO009, from two Portuguese manifesting characteristics of subtype G matched with sequences from Spain and Portugal; whereas the monophyletic group similar to CRF12_BF (MO007, MO021, MO106, MO108, MO111, MO112, MO113 and MO114) matched with sequences mainly from Brazil and a few from Europe (Supplementary Table). The high query coverage and high similarity in gag and pol regions of MO008 and MO009 suggested that the year of first HIV-positive diagnosis was around 2000, which is in concordance with our records.

The most common HIV subtypes in Portugal are B, G and CRF14_BG.8, 9 Coincidentally a cluster of CRF12_BF was reported in IDUs in southern Portugal in 2003, shortly before the Macao outbreak.10 Subtype F strain has also been reported in the European countries of Spain,2 Portugal,8 and Italy.11 The temporal and spatial information alongside the BLAST results suggests that IDUs in Portugal could have acquired CRF12_BF from South America and in turn introduced the strain into Macao.
