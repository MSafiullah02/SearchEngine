Indeed, we commonly manage and follow-up patients with different gastrointestinal conditions: severe flares of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for medical and surgical treatment; gastrointestinal bleeding or bilio-pancreatic disorders for interventional endoscopy; end-stage liver disease for stabilization and staging; hepatocellular carcinoma for oncological treatments (i.e. trans-arterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation and alcoholization); and oesophageal disorders for motility testing (i.e. achalasia) and endoscopic interventions (i.e. eosinophilic esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus and cancer).",

To note, our ward includes 20 beds for patients with any gastroenterologic indication referred by the Emergeny Room (ER), by our outpatient clinic or by spoke-Hospitals within the region or the country. In addition, two standard operational rooms and one radiological room for in-patients endoscopy are available. Finally, an ambulatory with two rooms to perform one-day Hospital admission (Day Hospital) works for all the procedures requiring short hospital-stay (i.e. drugs infusions, paracentesis, liver biopsies, polypectomies, GI dilatations etc.). Thus, we compared also the number of admissions to our Day Hospital during the two time periods.",

The two populations were similar in terms of mean age at the time of hospitalization, while more males were admitted during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period (p= 0.02). No statistically significant difference was observed regarding the referring unit: ER (71.7% vs 73.9%), outpatients clinics (26.1% vs 21.7%), and different wards/Hospirals (2.7% vs 4.3%) (p=0.76, for all). Moreover, no difference in terms of medical reason for hospitalization was observed (Table 1\n). The main cause for hospitalization from the ER, during the pre-lockdown period, was acute biliopancreatic disorders (11/33, 33%), while during the lockdown period was gastrointestinal bleeding (15/34, 44%) (p=ns, for all). During the same lockdown time, we did not observe any reduction of activity at our Day hospital as compared to the pre-lockdown period (p=ns). Indeed, most of the activity was related to the infusion of biologics in patients with IBD at both time-points (Figure 1\n). No COVID-19 was diagnosed among patients and hospital staff even though two young gastroenterology residents were quarantined because of possible strict contact with a COVID-19 case (Table 1). Over the same time, on April 7th, 116 patients with COVID-19 were hospitalised in non-intensive care units and 22 in intensive care units at our University Hospital of Padua.",

For instance, 40% of the accesses from ER were due to gastrointestinal bleedings, which cannot be postponed or prevented [1]. Also, our one-day hospital activity registered more than 250 accesses for infusion of biologics in IBD patients, who were invited to continue their current medications according to the more recent ECCO recommendations [2,3], supported by the lack of evidence of an increased risk of infection in these patients [4,5]. This approach has been corroborated by the fact that only 5 out of about 700 of our patients on biologic therapy were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, and none of our 135 patients with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders on active treatment.",
