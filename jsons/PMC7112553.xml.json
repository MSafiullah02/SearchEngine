From the genus Anaplasma to date Anaplasma phagocytophilum, A. platys, A. ovis and A. capra have been recognized to infect humans [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. In camels Anaplasma organisms have been reported in blood smears by light microscopy [6,7] and antibodies against them in blood serum [8,9]. However, so far the only Anaplasma species confirmed by DNA sequencing in camels are Candidatus Anaplasma camelii (genetically close to A. platys), A. phagocytophilum and A. ovis [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. Clinical signs of natural infections are described as fever, pale and icteric conjunctiva suggestive of anaemia, dullness, anorexia, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, emaciation, coughing, lacrimation, rough hair coat, abortion, and/or infertility [7,19]. Intramuscular administration of oxytetracycline at 20 mg/kg as specific therapy and injectable B-complex, iron, folic acid and hydroxycobalamin as supportive therapy is the recommended therapeutic regimen [7,19]. Infection with and antibodies against several species of Rickettsia [20,21], as well as infection with Bartonella [22] and Borrelia [23,24] have been also documented.",

Furthermore, genotypes similar to Candidatus Anaplasma camelii were found in blood-fed mosquitoes in China indicating that mosquitoes might play a role in the transmission and evolution of Anaplasma species [53]. Researchers have identified Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Candidatus Neoehrlichia, and Rickettsia bacteria in multiple mosquitoes and different life stages (egg, larvae, pupae, and adult) showing that mosquitoes may have played an important role in the transmission and evolution of Rickettsiales [53].
