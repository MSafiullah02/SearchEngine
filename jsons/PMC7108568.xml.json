Often they are ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral zoonoses, e.g. highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), hantaviruses (HTV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Jones et al., 2008; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009). They pose a significant threat to public health worldwide and are classified as emerging infectious diseases (Jones et al., 2008; Wang & Crameri, 2014). The spillover of these viruses to humans m ay result in severe, life-threatening disease, e.g. highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

The site of viral infection and disease associated with HPAI, HCPS, HFRS and SARS is the lower respiratory tract. It is generally assumed that the cytokine response drives the pathology rather than the viral load (Liu et al., 2016). The major target cells for HPAIV and SARS-CoV replication are type II aveolar epithelial cells (Weinheimer et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2013) and for HTV they are microvascular endothelial (Mackow et al., 2013). Other cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, may become infected and/or release pro-inflammatory cytokines that in turn affect their own cells (autocrine signalling) or other cells (paracrine signalling) to release additional cytokines (He et al., 2006). The clinical syndrome is characterized by acute lung injury, respiratory failure and a cytokine storm (Chan et al., 2005; Tisoncik et al., 2012). The cytokine-induced pro-inflammatory response plays a significant role in the pathology of these diseases (Frieman et al., 2008; Peiris et al., 2009) and leads to a system-wide cascade effect known as a cytokine storm (Tisoncik et al., 2012).",

These cytokines can influence the maintenance or differentiation of other cells, e.g. regulatory T cells (Tregs).

HPAI H5N1 infection in ducks, the natural reservoir, versus chickens shows different patterns of expression of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) gene family; IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes are upregulated in response to HPAIV in ducks but not in chickens (Smith et al., 2015).

This simple model with just a few parameters enables us to understand some basic interactions between the cytokines. The mechanisms responsible for the cytokine storm are much more complex. With time series data from carefully designed laboratory experiments, specific pathways and genes/proteins associated with pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses can be identified and used to test some of the outcomes of this simple model. The interaction of these two broad categories of cytokines is posited to play important roles in inflammatory immune responses (Seymour & Henderson, 2001) for both acute infectious diseases (Henderson et al., 1998) and chronic autoimmune diseases (McInnes & Schett, 2007).",

We focus primarily on the relation between the parameter that upregulates the pro-inflammatory response and three other parameters: representing clearance ratio, upregulation of anti-inflammatory response and background production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We concentrate on their functional role rather than identifying specific pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines (Reynolds et al., 2006).
