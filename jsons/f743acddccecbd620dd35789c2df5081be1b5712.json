The complexity of disease emergencies calls for the identification of often collaborative effective strategies, based on both science and proven practical experience, to reduce future threats. The H 5 N 1 avian influenza crisis has shown how crucial it is to address persistent global threats at the interface between humans, animals and ecosystems which requires (i) to strengthen animal and human health institutions and (ii) build strong partnerships among players who may have different perspectives on some issues and different levels of resources. To address the gaps in the animal health sector, OIE seeks to build member countries' capacities in policy design and good governance in animal health systems and Veterinary Services. At policy level, the OIE helps its members to enhance their credibility, both at the national and international level, by providing them with efficient tools, such as the strategic planning tools of the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway, with the objective to attract more commitment and more resources from their decision makers and partners. At good governance level, it provides science-based guidance that supports members in detecting, preventing and managing serious animal disease outbreaks through improved surveillance systems, strengthened laboratory networks and improved legislation. OIE promotes strong partnerships, notably with FAO and WHO, especially with regard to two topics that are getting currently a great attention and that require a strong multi-sectoral collaboration at all levels because of their social, economical and ecological determinants: rabies in humans that still kills more than 50,000 persons every year, mainly in Asia and mostly youngsters, and that is believed to be totally",

On the animal production side, avian influenza has been, and is actually still, responsible for massive losses in the avian industry by direct mortality or through culling in many countries and especially in Southeast Asia. It has to be noted that these three diseases have originated more than likely from China or Southeast Asia. At the same time, and in addition to these socalled emerging infectious diseases, some other diseases that concern domesticated animals, such as rabies or foot-and-mouth disease, are kind of constantly re-emerging at the interface between humans, animals and the ecosystems and continue, even though less visibly at the first glance, to have serious consequences for human health and for animal health in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world.",

The need to fight animal diseases at a global level led to its creation through an international agreement signed on 25 January 1924. In May 2003, the office became the World Organisation for Animal Health but kept its historical acronym OIE. It is recognised as a reference organisation by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in 2011 had a total of 178 member countries. The OIE maintains permanent relations with 45 other international and regional organisations and has regional and sub-regional offices on every continent. To address the gaps in the animal health sector, OIE seeks to build member countries' capacities in policy design and good governance in animal health systems and veterinary services. Simultaneously, OIE promotes strong partnerships, notably with FAO and WHO, especially with regard to emerging issues and two topics that are getting currently a great attention and that require a strong multi-sectoral collaboration at all levels because of their social, economical and ecological determinants: rabies and foodand-mouth disease (FMD) (http://www.oie.int/about-us/).",

Indeed, the warm and humid climate, as well as richness in wildlife host species, favours the spillover of zoonotic pathogens from wildlife to humans and domestic animals and the transmission of vector-borne pathogens (Jones et al. 2008) . Some prevailing sociocultural practices, such as an increasing encroachment of human activities in the forests or the close contact between human and livestock populations, especially in poor and marginalised populations, provide excellent conditions for the frequent exchange of pathogens between animal and human populations. Furthermore, the high human and animal density and the globalisation of trade facilitate the spread of the diseases. Finally, a weakness of medical and veterinarian institutional capacity and a lack of food security and safety are aggravating factors for the endemisation of the diseases (Bhatia and Narain 2010) .",

Furthermore, even if Southeast Asia is not among the main hotspots of recent emerging infectious disease events, the region is considered at high risk for the future emergence of zoonotic pathogens from wildlife and vector-borne pathogens (Jones et al. 2008) . However, even though they actually did not emerge there, the most recent emerging zoonoses have developed themselves and sometimes geographically been embedded into Southeast Asia -severe respiratory acute syndrome (SARS) virus, Nipah virus (NiV) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. The occurrence and spread of zoonoses in Southeast Asia can be explained by the coexistence of different factors that facilitate the interspecies transmission, maintenance and dissemination of pathogens. One of the major reasons is the increased contact between humans, domestic animals and wildlife, due to the exceptionally high growth rate of the human and livestock population, the expansion and intensification of agriculture and human encroachment on game reserves (C\u00e1ceres and Otte 2009) . The changing lifestyles associated with the globalisation of commerce and trades allow rapid propagation of pathogens. Additionally, in most of the countries in Southeast Asia, neither the health nor veterinary services have sufficient capacity and resources to detect emerging pathogens early and to contain infections in animals (Bhatia and Narain 2010) .",

In 2010, they drafted a document, which set out a joint strategy and proposed a long-term basis for coordinating global activities to address health risks at the human-animal-ecosystems interface (FAO et al. 2010) . They agreed that the implementation of an efficient multidisciplinary approach requires that (i) both human and animal health systems need to further strengthen their own capacities in the public and private sector and (ii) strong partnerships among players who may have different perspectives on some issues and different levels of resources have to be built. The Tripartite Concept Note provides a background and establishes a strategic alignment and some collaborations and joint actions, as well as the way forward that partners may consider when conducting One Health activities. At the regional level in Southeast Asia, one of the first such efforts was the Regional Workshop on Collaboration Between Human and Animal Health Sectors on Zoonoses Prevention and Control convened in December 2010 in Sapporo, Japan, and co-organised by the FAO, OIE and WHO. The meeting produced several recommendations to strengthen this collaboration. Member countries were called on to establish a functional coordination mechanism between their animal and human health sectors by 2011. The recommendations also called on the FAO, OIE and WHO to continue their collaboration with each other, countries and regional organisations (i.e. ASEAN, SAARC) to strengthen the coordination mechanism (FAO et al. 2010) .",

A specific methodology has been developed and approved by the members, and the OIE has published the 'OIE Tool for the Evaluation of Performance of Veterinary Services' (the OIE PVS Tool) as the basis for evaluating performance against the international standards published in the Terrestrial Code. A similar tool is available for the evaluation of Aquatic Animal Health Services. The PVS Pathway starts with a PVS evaluation mission which consists of a qualitative assessment of the performance and the compliance of a country's VS (veterinary services) in accordance with the OIE standards on the quality of VS. A PVS Gap Analysis mission follows which facilitates the definition of a country's objectives in terms of compliance with OIE quality standards, suitably adapted to national constraints and priorities. This analysis provides an outline of the corresponding financial action plan, which can be used to legitimate requests for funding from the government or donors. Based on the gaps the country has defined, some activities or projects and programmes are proposed and implemented in the field of the veterinary legislation, public/private partnerships, veterinary education or laboratories. Finally, follow-up missions provide a way of measuring the progress that countries have made in sustainably improving their compliance with the OIE quality standards. Only OIE-certified PVS experts can carry out independent external PVS evaluations of country's Veterinary Services and PVS Gap Analysis. They have undergone training sessions organised by the OIE and funded by donors to the OIE World Fund. All experts use standard tools, indicators and experts' manuals, prepared and published by the OIE Headquarters, which also include template reports (http://www.oie.int/support-to-oie-members/ pvs-pathway/).",

First of all, the training and the management of the veterinarians and animal health workers are recognised as the main challenges to ensure a good governance. The initial veterinary education, of varying quality in the area, needs to be strengthened. In some countries, such as Cambodia or Laos, where there were up to now no veterinary schools and where the remaining active vets will retire in the coming years, this need is particularly strong. On the governance side, the efficacy of the chain of command from the central administration to the field is essential to react quickly when an issue arises. Some countries, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, have experienced successive episodes of decentralisation that are often believed to have undermined this process. In addition, the level of remuneration of the staff in charge of the controls, including those at the borders, is sometimes insufficient to prevent them from the temptation of seeking additional revenues for instance through getting a second job or even granting favours. And, along the same line, when financial compensation is lacking or inadequate, farmers hesitate to report diseases for which the total or partial culling of the herd is required.",

The disease is still widespread throughout the world, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. By the end of May 2012, at the time of the second Global Conference on the topic in Bangkok, more than 100 countries were not FMD-free which means that, beyond the impact of the disease in their territories, they remain a continuous threat to free countries. In developed countries, FMD has catastrophic consequences when declared. It can indeed severely affect and disrupt regional and international trade in animals and animal products causing enormous financial damage. The 2001 outbreak in the UK is estimated to have cost no less than ten billions euros. Australia estimates that an incursion of FMD that would not be immediately controlled would cost 3 % of its annual GDP. In addition, massive culling during outbreaks has created animal welfare and ethical concerns not only in the animal production sector, but in society as a whole. In developing countries, where the adverse effects of FMD are often underestimated, the disease undermines food security and economic development, at the level of both village smallholders and the more organised production chains.",

Many species of cloven-hoofed wildlife may become infected, such as deer, antelope, elephant, giraffe and some other species as well. Even though it has not been demonstrated for any other wild species, the African buffalo can serve as a source of FMD infection for domestic animals in Sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, FMD is typically the kind of disease arising at the human-animal-ecosystems interface which is not a zoonotic disease (http://www.oie.int/en/internationalstandard-setting/terrestrial-manual/access-online/). FMD epidemiology is complex and this has important implications as it allows to learn many lessons that can be used to strengthen the systems as a whole and that can be reused for many other diseases. The agent which causes FMD is an aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae. There are seven strains (A, O, C, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3 and Asia1) each one requiring a specific vaccine strain to provide immunity to a vaccinated animal. FMD is characterised by fever and blister-like sores on the tongue and lips, in the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves that can be the symptoms of numerous other diseases. The disease is not a killing disease and mainly causes severe production losses that are easy to be visualised by the owner when it affects dairy production but that are more difficult to assess and to quantify at the first glance when talking about meat cattle production. While the majority of affected animals recover, the disease often leaves them weakened and debilitated. In a susceptible population, morbidity approaches 100 %. Intensively reared animals are more susceptible to the disease than traditional breeds. If the disease is rarely fatal in adult animals, there is however often high mortality in young animals due to myocarditis or by lack of milk when the dam is infected by the disease (http://www. srr-seasia-oie.com/disease-info/foot-and-mouth-disease/). FMD is, with rinderpest, one of the first severe diseases that has been listed (Chap. 1.2, Article 1.2.3) in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code at the creation of the organisation in 1924. Rinderpest has been declared eradicated from the world in 2011 and the international community is now focusing on FMD. Technically, OIE members are committed by the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, 2009, (Chap. 1.2, Article 1.2.3) to report to the OIE (Chap. 1.1 -Notification of Diseases and Epidemiological Information). FMD is the first disease for which the OIE established an official list of free countries and zones with or without vaccination.",

It is now assumed that the control of FMD cannot be sustained if good governance of animal health systems, including effective Veterinary Services complying with OIE standards and updated legislation, is not in place and supported by appropriate public/private partnerships (FAO/OIE Global conference on FMD, June 2012, BKK).",

The owner of a pet shop, a public health official, was bitten by one of her dogs, a 3-year-old Rottweiler in December 2009. The woman developed rabies symptoms and died in February 2010. The dog later died, followed by another eight pets at the victim's house. She was vaccinating the dogs by herself. This case underlines that there are a circulation of fake vaccines in the region and a lack of awareness of the population about the epidemiology of the disease, even for people working in the field of public health (http://www.promedmail.org/mbds, archive number: 20100225.0623).",

Rabies control involves multiple agencies, including those responsible for human and animal (domestic and wild) health, and requires coordinated management across these sectors. An improved exchange of information between sectors is needed for better patient information, planning of personal protective equipment and monitoring the success of dog vaccination campaigns. According to Dr. Bernard Vallat, OIE director general, success in eradicating rabies relies on the close collaboration between public health and veterinary services in designing the control programmes. Good veterinary governance is crucial to applying successfully the technologies and tools available for rabies control but, most importantly, veterinary services have to establish collaboration between different sectors, beyond public health services. The OIE is so committed to supporting the efforts of the international community to achieve worldwide eradication of rabies (Seoul, Sept 2011) .",

OIE has been campaigning to all governments and international agencies to provide veterinary services worldwide with resources to control rabies in animals. Part of this campaign is to highlight the importance of canine rabies during international meetings and workshops, to tackle not only technical challenges in controlling rabies but also in gaining political support. The SRR has closely worked with ASEAN in getting political commitment from member states to control rabies. Using the recommendations from the OIE Rabies Conference for Eurasia in 2007, the OIE Bangkok worked with the ASEAN through the ASEAN + 3 EID project funded by AusAID, in coming up with a policy statement to support rabies control in ASEAN plus three countries. This statement dubbed as 'Call for Action towards the Elimination of Rabies in the ASEAN Member States and Plus Three Countries' was finally endorsed both by the ASEAN Health and Agriculture Ministers in 2008 and 2009, respectively. It provides recommendations at the national level in terms of policies and legislation, prevention, control, surveillance, partnership, public awareness and communication and at the regional level in terms of prevention, control, information sharing, capacity building, coordination, training and research (www.aseanplus3-eid.info/dl.php?\u2026Rabies_Call_f\u2026). This document will be a useful tool for veterinary services to lobby their governments for support. The OIE, through its SEACFMD Campaign, has a long experience in coordinating regional control of transboundary animal diseases. The SEACFMD 2020 Roadmap could also be used in developing a multi-sectoral rabies control strategy in Southeast Asia. Support from FAO, WHO and other partners is crucial in the development of this strategy.",

This first regional rabies vaccine bank was launched in early 2012 and could serve as a model for developing other rabies vaccine banks in other regions of the world. The bank delivers vaccines to eligible countries (according to donor requirements) at the request of member countries, allowing effective public/private partnerships between international organisations, national authorities, local authorities, NGOs and private companies to be established. The guidelines for the use of the vaccine bank approved by the eligible countries specify that the applicant country must, in particular, (i) prove that there is an increase in bite rates and human mortality, that the location of the outbreak(s) increases the risk of rabies spreading to people and/or animals and that further spread of the disease may occur, (ii) provide a statement explaining that the National Veterinary Services are engaged and will have the authority to implement or supervise the vaccination of dogs, (iii) submit a specific vaccination control strategy, (iv) specify the nature and quantities of vaccines required, and (v) agree to international transportation conditions. Coinciding with World Rabies Day in 2012, the OIE donated 50,000 injectable rabies vaccines to Lao PDR through the regional rabies vaccine bank (see map). Following this first donation, other countries have requested the OIE for vaccine deliveries. Among them are countries in which GARC (Global Alliance for Rabies Control) has projects, like the Philippines. Other deliveries are under preparation in other Southeast Asian countries (http://www.rabiescontrol.net/news/news-archive/oiesupport-to-rabies-endemic-countries-a-vaccine-bank-in-asia.html).",

It is now necessary to improve this integrated collaborative approach with the inclusion of human and social sciences, to take into account the social drivers for emergence, maintenance and spread of diseases. But, there is a dearth of information on the strategies to put interdisciplinarity collaboration into practice and no evidence of its effectiveness. A study carried out by Anholt et al. (2012) shows that the essential components of an ID approach that could support initiatives like the One Health movement were mainly the professional social networks that provide connections across disciplines and the need of trust and respect among disciplines. Education and experiential learning opportunities remain so the best tools to develop interdisciplinarity this time.",
