The main causes of acute pancreatitis in adults are alcohol abuse and gallstones. In children, trauma is the main cause of pancreatitis. \u2022 In general, the prognosis of acute pancreatitis in children is excellent. Pancreatitis is occasionally complicated by the formation of a pseudocyst, reported in 10-23% of cases of acute pancreatitis. \u2022 Pancreatitis develops as a result of blockage or disruption of the collecting ducts and damage to the pancreatic acinar cells. \u2022 This leads to activation and release of digestive enzymes. \u2022 The activated enzymes autodigest the pancreatic parenchyma, causing inflammation and, potentially, necrosis. \u2022 Localized collections of pancreatic secretions may become walled off by granulation tissue and form a pseudocyst either within the pancreatic tissue or immediately adjacent to it. \u2022 Pancreatitis can be local or diffuse and classified as:",

Endoscopic drainage. Internal drainage via cyst gastrostomy or cyst enterostomy. Surgical approaches for internal drainage are largely determined by the anatomic location of the pseudocyst. Cystogastrostomy: If the pseudocyst is adherent to the posterior wall of the stomach. Cystoduodenostomy: If the cyst is present in the head of the pancreas. Cystojejunostomy: For cysts that are not adherent to the stomach or duodenum. Distal pancreatectomy: Considered when the pseudocyst is in the tail of the gland.",
