The quality and/or magnitude of the antibody response is an important correlate of protection against many pathogens, including viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Couch et al., 2013; Subbarao et al., 2004) . IAV is a particularly large public health burden, with seasonal IAV strains incurring significant morbidity and mortality annually (estimated 50 million cases, 1 million hos-pitalizations, and 80 thousand deaths in the 2017-2018 season) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018) . Though vaccination is an important component of influenza control, existing influenza vaccines often exhibit low efficacy. While this is partially due to antigenic mismatch between vaccines and circulating influenza strains (Lewnard and Cobey, 2018) , numerous studies have shown that some individuals fail to mount a sufficient protective antibody response upon vaccination (Wiedermann et al., 2016) .",

These factors include age, underlying disease states, and prior exposure history to related pathogens or vaccines (Lewnard and Cobey, 2018) . Despite some dissent (Brodin et al., 2015) , multiple studies across different pathogens and vaccines indicate that antibody responses have a strong heritable component, with many estimates of $50% (Kruskall et al., 1992; Linnik and Egli, 2016; Ovsyannikova et al., 2012) . In the case of the measles vaccine, the antibody response was nearly 90% heritable, suggesting that genetics are a predominant factor contributing to interindividual variation in vaccine response (Tan et al., 2001) . Despite this strong evidence for the role of genetic variation in modulating antibody response, the genetic factors regulating antibody response to IAV are unknown. Complicating this type of analysis is the fact that antibody response is the downstream result of a complex immunological process involving multiple tissues, cell types, and cell signaling pathways. Genes underlying variation in antibody response may be involved in any stage of the response, from general regulatory aspects of B cell development to more IAV-specific effects such as innate immune sensing. An understanding of naturally polymorphic genes involved in the antibody response, how they function, and whether their effects are broad or pathogen specific could lead to improved vaccine design, such as by utilization of adjuvants that specifically target relevant pathways and boost antibody response.",

            "text": "Despite the importance of understanding genetic regulation of pathogen-specific immune responses, identifying and studying genetic determinants of host antibody responses or other aspects of immunity is challenging in humans. Demographic and environmental factors such as viral dose and prior immune history affect immune responses to infection or vaccination (Lewnard and Cobey, 2018) and confound analyses. Furthermore, a lack of replicates in outbred humans, as well as difficulties accessing relevant tissues, presents challenges for phenotyping and mechanistic validation. Historically, mouse models have been used to overcome many of the logistical, experimental, and ethical issues that confound human studies. The genetic tractability of the mouse genome, including the ready availability of many gene-specific knockouts, and the ability to easily generate new knockouts, has provided key insights into the host pathways that control both development of the immune system and the quality and durability of vaccine-induced immunity (Li et al., 2008; Vidal et al., 2008) . Increasingly, it is appreciated that standard laboratory mouse strains do not recapitulate the genetic diversity observed in the outbred human population (Saul et al., 2019) , and this lack of diversity has limited the utility of the mouse in identifying polymorphic genes and pathways that contribute to the variation in the adaptive immune responses observed in humans.",

Furthermore, use of the CC enables analysis of correlations between mapped QTL and additional phenotypes across studies, extending the ability to interpret the breadth of phenotypic effect of mapped loci beyond the context in which they were originally mapped. Relevant to this study, CC mice display a wide range of phenotypes in response to challenge with IAV (Ferris et al., 2013; Kollmus et al., 2018; Maurizio et al., 2017) as well as variation in antibody glycosylation (Kri sti c et al., 2018) .",

This population provided a reproducible population of heterozygous animals to mimic the genetic heterozygosity of the human population (see Data S1 for full list of the F1s with complete strain names including laboratory codes). Our analysis focused on HA-specific antibody responses, as the bulk of the anti-IAV antibody response is directed against the HA protein, and HA-specific antibody responses are most correlated with protective neutralization (Johansson et al., 1987) . Female mice from 116 CC-F1s were infected intranasally with IAV A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) and sacrificed at multiple time points post-infection (3 mice per CC-F1 at each time point for a total of $1,350 mice). IAV-specific antibody was measured from animals sacrificed at days 7, 10, 15, and 45 post-infection to capture both early and late humoral immune responses. IgM, IgG1, IgG2a+IgG2c (combined detection of subtypes that segregate across mouse strains (Zhang et al., 2012b) ), IgG2b, IgG3, and total IgG were quantified from each animal (a total of $8,000 antibody measurements across the 116 CC-F1s and 4 time points) to capture differential dynamics of individual antibody subtypes and isotypes across our infection time course.",

A number of F1s showed abnormal IgM responses, with later peaks (e.g., at day 15, CC012xCC038 and CC032xCC017) or increasing through day 45 (e.g., CC011xCC032; Figure 1D ).

Correlations between individual subtypes at different time points were largely driven by temporal kinetics, aside from IgM and some IgG1 responses that cluster independently ( Figure 1B) . Interestingly, antibody composition on days 7 and 15 clustered most similarly, followed by day 45 and lastly day 10. This clustering suggests that day 10 may represent a unique inflection point in the antibody response across the CC population, as opposed to a natural continuation of the responses between days 7 and 15.",

Similar to the variation in antibody response (Figure 1 ), CC-F1s exhibited a wide range of disease outcomes following IAV infection, ranging from asymptomatic to severe weight loss and mortality ( Figure S2 ). We have previously shown that these differences in disease susceptibility can largely be attributed to variation in the IAV resistance gene Mx1 (Maurizio et al., 2017) , although other smaller effect loci also contribute to variation in IAV susceptibility (Ferris et al., 2013) . Given the role of Mx1 in regulating both disease susceptibility and viral load, we assessed whether Mx1 haplotype correlated with the antibody response. Protective Mx1 haplotypes (associated with decreased viral load and weight loss) showed some relationship with decreased antibody response throughout infection, with the strongest relationship seen early in infection (days 7 and 10) and with IgG1 and IgG3 (Table S1 ). However, these relationships waned over time and were not sufficient to fully explain the variation in antibody responses we observed throughout our study. In order to further clarify the role of Mx1 and viral load in influencing antibody responses, we measured viral load by genome copy assay at day 2 post-infection for a subset of CC-F1s selected for either high or low IgG responses at day 10 post-infection. We observed no trend between viral load and IgG levels on any day post-infection ( Figure S3 ). We also assessed whether the antibody response was associated with IAV-induced disease as measured by maximal weight loss, with control for Mx1 haplotype. We observed correlations between maximal weight loss and the IgG1 response across time points, in addition to with early IgM and late total IgG (Table  S2) , with increased antibody levels associated with enhanced weight loss. These observations suggest that there is a relationship between antibody response and the severity of virusinduced disease that is independent of Mx1-mediated effects.",

Next, candidate SNPs were categorized based on the classification of the affected genetic element (e.g., regulatory region, protein-coding gene, or non-coding RNA). While variation in regulatory regions, microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), or other genetic elements may drive QTLs, We assessed the impact that a WSB/EiJ haplotype (x axis; 1 = one WSB haplotype; 2 = two non-WSB haplotypes) have on other IAV antibody responses in this study (y axis: CC-F1 mean levels of transformed AUC levels for given isotypes/time points).

However, studying the role of the genetic factors that contribute to regulation of the antibody response is challenging in humans due to confounding demographic and environmental variables, as well as the relatively late stage in infection when the humoral response occurs. To study the role of host genetics in driving the antibody response to IAV, we used a diverse panel of CC-F1s and found that CC mice exhibit high levels of variation in susceptibility to disease as well as the generation and maintenance of specific antibody isotypes and subtypes. In concordance with human studies (Kruskall et al., 1992; Linnik and Egli, 2016; Ovsyannikova et al., 2012) , we found strong evidence for genetic control of these traits (median heritability, 44%) and were able to map multiple loci associated with antibody responses. Variants under each QTL were considered if they were above the association testing threshold and were contained in a protein-coding gene. Protein-coding genes were then evaluated based on whether they were expressed in the lung or immune tissue. Using a separate transcriptional dataset from 11 CC strains infected with H3N2 influenza, IAV-specific and haplotype-specific differential expression was evaluated. Genes were considered if they had non-synonymous coding variants or splice region variants or showed haplotype-specific expression. See also Figure S4 and Table S7. Cell Reports 31, 107587, April 28, 2020 9 Article ll OPEN ACCESS In addition to genetic mapping, the CC provides a platform for phenotypic discovery and model development. Unique combinations of alleles present in CC mice may present as novel phenotypes, which can provide an opportunity to study interesting disease features and/or more closely model human disease (Rasmussen et al., 2014; Rogala et al., 2014) . We identified multiple CC-F1s with outlier antibody response phenotypes in our investigation, including multiple F1s with persistent IAV-specific IgM responses. Importantly, those F1s with persistent IgM responses were not defective in IAV-specific IgG responses, and some had protective Mx1 alleles, suggesting that the sustained IgM response was not due to failure in class switching or inability to control viral replication. Notably, two highlighted CC-F1s with persistent IgM responses shared the parental strain CC032, suggesting that genetic contributions from CC032 (independent of Ari3, for which CC032 has the low-response haplotype) may be involved in longer lasting IgM responses. Such outlier strains can be used to model these aberrant responses and/or included in future targeted mapping studies (e.g., F2 crosses).",

This issue of ''missing heritability'' (the inability to identify all the genetic factors that contribute to heritable variation) is prevalent across genetic mapping studies. Missing heritability can be explained by numerous factors, including lack of sufficient power or informative lines to detect variants of small effect, phenotypic heterogeneity (i.e., same phenotype, different cause), complex genetic architecture, and blindness to genetic features such as copy number variants or epigenetic modifications (Manolio et al., 2009 ). More targeted studies, such as 2-strain intercrosses, allow for a more complete discovery of phenotypic modulation with greater power to identify more complex genetic interactions such as epistasis (Gralinski et al., 2017; Rogala et al., 2014) .

When testing for further associations with Ari1-Ari4 haplotypes across antibody datasets (IAV, SARS-CoV, and CHIKV), rather than focusing on any individual association, we were interested in robust and persistent trends in correlations across isotypes and/or time points. This is critical due to the differing heritability and potential genetic architecture across isotypes and time points. Therefore, while we did not utilize false discovery rate or multiple-test corrections in assessing these relationships, these trends are indicative of important relationships that merit further study. Furthermore, consideration of these trends, or lack thereof, can provide insight into possible mechanisms by which the genes driving QTL impact the antibody response. Ari1 showed broad effects on the early antibody response to IAV only and was not associated with antibody response to SARS-CoV or CHIKV, suggesting that it may be involved with specific responses to IAV such as innate immune recognition and response or antigen presentation. Ari2 showed broad early effects with IAV as well as SARS-CoV-specific responses, suggesting that the underlying gene is involved in early stages of infection or immune response for respiratory pathogens. Ari3 also showed broad early effects with IAV and a strong correlation with antibody response to CHIKV, though the Article ll OPEN ACCESS haplotype effects were in opposing directions for these two different viruses. Ari4 was most relevant for day 15 antibody response to IAV and also showed strong associations with antibody response to SARS-CoV, suggesting that it may be widely relevant for the development of the humoral response. These broad associations highlight the utility of the CC as a resource to extend analyses into related datasets to gain further understanding of the role of loci across phenotypes while illustrating the need for future work to define the specific mechanisms by which each of these loci affect antiviral antibody response. In addition to impacting the scope of pathogens for which a QTL may play a role, the mechanisms by which these loci mediate antibody response to primary H1N1 infection is also relevant for their potential to affect antibody response to other strains of IAV or even IAV vaccination. QTLs that are driven by genes involved in early innate response in the lung are more likely to be specific to primary infection and may also be virus-strain specific (Ryan et al., 2018) . Alternatively, QTLs that appear to be more generally involved in the later humoral response, such as Ari4, may be more likely to have a broader effect that is relevant for other IAV strains and vaccination.",

This is exemplified by Ari2, under which Nlrp1b was identified as the strongest candidate gene, carrying haplotype-specific coding variants predicted to be strongly deleterious to the encoded innate immune sensor. However, analysis of this gene and interpretation of expression data is challenging because of the newly described genetic complexity of the locus; multiple Nlrp1 paralogs and haplotypes sort across mouse strains and have not been fully characterized (e.g., WSB/EiJ mice carry 5 Nlrp1 paralogs, only 2 of which are shared with the reference C57BL/6J) (Lilue et al., 2018) . Upon IAV infection, Nlrp1b knockout mice did not show significant differences in antibody response ( Figure S5 ). While this lack of phenotype might suggest that Nlrp1b is not causal for the Ari2 phenotype, it is equally likely that the specific Nlrp1b allelic variant in the CC, or one of the Nlrp1 paralogs, is responsible for the effect of Ari2. Continued work to deconvolute the mouse genome across genetically diverse strains, as well as advances in molecular and genetic tools such as CRISPR, will facilitate follow-up analyses on such complex loci.",

Notably, we studied IAV exposure in naive animals, whereas prior infection (especially with IAV) is a large factor in shaping the humoral immune response in humans (Lewnard and Cobey, 2018) . Nonetheless, we identified multiple loci with genes that overlap with human mapping studies of antibody response or influenza infection. Ari1 contains kinesin family member 6 (Kif6), which was identified in a human study of antibody response to smallpox vaccination (Ovsyannikova et al., 2012) . Kif6 did not meet our formal candidate criteria as its coding variant was synonymous and it did not show haplotype-specific expression in the dataset that we utilized. Additionally, Ari2 contains two genes that were identified in a human study of severe pneumonia associated with H1N1 influenza infection (Z\u00fa \u00f1 iga et al., 2012) , Rpain and complement component 1 Q subcomponent-binding protein (C1qbp), a high-affinity receptor for the complement protein C1q that is important for dendritic cell maturation (Gotoh et al., 2018) . While Rpain met our criteria as a candidate gene, and is therefore a high-priority candidate for additional analysis, C1qbp1 had a non-coding variant, but did not show haplotype-specific expression in the lungs or blood. Lastly, as noted above, Tapt1 under Ari4 has been associated with variation in antibody responses to IAV vaccination in humans (Ovsyannikova et al., 2016) , making this gene a high-priority candidate for additional study. While not all of these genes made it through our formal selection criteria, this concordance between loci mapped in our study and in human studies demonstrates the translational relevance of our work, and we are optimistic that other loci mapped here could be validated and important in humans.",

Multiple significant and suggestive QTLs were identified, including Ari1-Ari4, which likely drive variation in IAV-specific antibody response through different mechanisms. Ari loci also showed effects on the antibody response to SARS-CoV and CHIKV, suggesting that these QTLs are broadly important for antibody response to multiple pathogens. Candidate genes for Ari loci have been identified and show overlap with genes identified in human studies. Overall, our findings demonstrate that multiple independent loci regulate the magnitude, kinetics, and composition of IAV-specific antibody. These results further demonstrate the utility of the CC for modeling how host genetic variation shapes pathogen-specific immunity and open the door to more robust modeling of the complex interplay between genetics and environment in promoting protective adaptive immune responses to pathogens.",

Half-log serum dilutions (10 2 to 10 5.5 ) were prepared in wash buffer (0.033% Tween-20 in PBS), added to coated plates, and incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 4 C. Plates were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse, IgM = 1020-05, IgG1 = 1070-05, IgG2a = 1080-05 pooled with IgG2c = 1079-05, IgG2b = 1090-05, IgG3 = 1100-05, Total IgG = 1030-05) for approximately 2 hours at 4 C.

AUC was determined to be the most inclusive measure to robustly captured the dynamic range of antibody levels across our sample set, and performed better than other measurements such as half maximal or lowest positive titer. To monitor consistency across assays, C57BL6/J immune sera as well as serum samples from CC-F1s that were repeated across multiple cohorts were measured multiple times alongside different sets of experimental samples. CHIKV ELISA CHIKV-specific antibodies in mouse sera were measured using a virion-based ELISA as described (Hawman et al., 2016) .

RNA was isolated using QIAGEN Midi Kit. RNA quality was controlled on a 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). All RNA samples had a RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of R 9.5. 3 to 6 independent biological replicates were selected for each time point for subsequent RNA sequencing. 500ng of total RNA was used to prepare libraries for sequencing using the Lexogen SENSE mRNAseq library kit for Ion Torrent. Libraries amplified for 11 cycles as the final step of library preparation. Before sequencing, 1ul aliquots of this material was pooled and sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM 314 chip. Barcode quantification data from the PGM were used to balance the barcodes for final pooling before sequencing. Following this final pooling, the library pools were sized to a target size of 260bp on a Pippin Prep instrument using the 2% Pippin Agarose gel. The sized libraries were examined on an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA chip, quantified using real-time PCR, and used to prepare spheres using a One-Touch 2 device. These spheres were then sequenced on an Ion Torrent Proton sequencer with a P1 chip. The mean number of reads per sample was 24 million. Reads were quality checked with package FastQC (Andrews, 2010) , then trimmed using Trimgalore (Krueger, 2012) . Trimmed reads were mapped to mouse genome annotation mm10 (build 38.1) using STAR aligner (Dobin et al., 2016) . Further analysis and visualization of expression data was performed using the R software package. Mapped reads were feature counted (per gene) using RsubRead (Liao et al., 2019) . Raw counts from mouse genome and virus mapping were then combined and normalized using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) . After normalization, single extreme outlier points were razorized, log 2 transformed, normalized expression levels were then batch corrected using package sva (Leek, 2014) . Extreme outlier samples were identified in principle component analyses and removed. For each group, 3 to 4 replicates were retained. Log 2 transformed, normalized and batch corrected expression levels were outputted for further use. Blood expression Analysis of expression data from blood was previously described (Kollmus et al., 2018) . Briefly, blood was collected for RNA isolation at multiple time points (days 3, 5, and 8) post-infection by retro-orbital bleed. RNA was isolated, transcribed into cDNA, amplified with incorporation of cyanine 3-labeled CTP, and hybridized to a whole mouse genome microarray (Agilent 026655).",

Candidate SNPs were then run through the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (McLaren et al., 2010) to determine the genetic classification of the affected gene as well as the predicted consequence of the SNP itself. We selected variants in protein-coding genes only and then filtered to genes expressed in the lung, thymus, and/or spleen. Coding variants were further considered if they were predicted to have a functional consequence on the protein product (e.g., missense versus synonymous variant). Non-coding variants were further considered if haplotype-specific expression differences were observed in lung and/or blood. Genes with coding and/or non-coding variants that met these criteria were included in our final list of candidate genes.",

Collaborative Cross genomes are best represented as a 36-state probability matrix (where at each marker, the values indicate the likelihood that a mouse from that strain has a given homozygous (n = 8) or heterozygous (n = 28) diplotype). We took the 36-state probability files from the CC Most Recent Common Ancestors (MRCAs) consensuses for each strain and simplified these to 8-state probabilities as previously described (Srivastava et al., 2017) . For each CC-F1, we averaged the 8-state probabilities of the two parent CC strains. This approach is the most accurate for F1 animals, as they will receive only one allele from each parent CC strain. For genetic mapping in DOQTL, a multiple regression is run at each marker, running the phenotype of interest against haplotype probabilities for each strain. LOD scores are calculated based on the improvement of fit in this model compared to a null model considering only covariates and kinship. To determine significance, permutation tests were run in which phenotype and genotype data are shuffled without replacement to generate a series of null LOD scores, of which the highest is archived. Based on 1000 permutations, we determined null distributions. We calculated p value scores by empirical cumulative distribution function, comparing the maximum LOD score for a QTL to the distribution of null permutations. QTL regions were determined using a 1.5LOD drop interval.",

Figure S1 . CC-F1s varied significantly in overall levels and kinetics of the IAV-specific antibody response. CC003xCC062 (black) represents a notable outlier, showing significantly higher antibody levels at day 45-post infection compared to the rest of the F1s (grey) for all antibody types besides IgG1, despite low-to-normal responses at earlier timepoints (day 10 = no data). Points represent mean values for CC-F1s, with approximately 3 mice per CC-F1. Related to Figure 1 . Figure S2 . CC-F1 population exhibits broad variation in IAV-induced weight loss. While the IAV resistance gene Mx1 is the strongest genetic driver of overall susceptibility to IAV, and Mx1-deficient animals showed increased weight loss overall, the F1 population showed significant variation in both the magnitude and kinetics of weight loss that was not solely dependent on Mx1 haplotype (red = IAV infected, blue = mock treatment). Points represent individual mice, with weight loss trajectories fitted by Loess curves. Related to Figure 1 . Figure S3 . IAV viral load is not associated with IgG response. Lung viral load at day 2 post-infection was measured by RT-PCR (normalized to 18S) for a subset of CC-F1s selected for having either high or low antibody response at day 10 post-infection and compared to antibody response across days 7, 10, 15, and 45 (separate figure panels). Points represent mean values for CC-F1s, with approximately 3 mice per CC-F1. Related to Figure 1 . Figure S4 . Highlighted genes under Ari loci show haplotype-and/or IAV-specific differential expression. Candidate genes under Ari1-4 were evaluated for differential expression in the context of IAV infection and between haplotype groups using lung and blood transcriptional datasets from 11 CC strains infected with IAV H3N2 (Y-axis; log2 transformed and normalized read counts). Each connected point represents the mean value for an individual CC strain, with 3-4 mice per strain. Numbers and color refer to haplotype groups (0/red = low, 1/blue = high) for each QTL. A) Ldb2, a candidate under Ari4, shows both IAV-induced and haplotype-specific differential expression in the lung (0 = A/J, 129S1/SvImJ, CAST/EiJ, WSB/EiJ, 1 = C57BL/6J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ, PwK/PhJ). B) Xaf1, under Ari2, shows IAV-induced differential expression but not haplotype-specific differential expression in the lung (0 = WSB/EiJ, 1 = else). C) Tapt1, a candidate under Ari4, shows haplotype-specific differential expression but not IAV-induced differential expression in the lung (0 = A/J, 129S1/SvImJ, CAST/EiJ, WSB/EiJ, 1 = C57BL/6J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ, PwK/PhJ). D) Unc5cl, a candidate under Ari1, shows both IAV-induced and haplotype-specific differential expression in the blood (0 = NOD/ShiLtJ, WSB/EiJ, 1 = else). Related to figure 5. Figure S5 . Nlrp1b does not show a significant effect on antibody response to IAV. Nlrp1b was investigated as a candidate under Ari2. Nlrp1b+/-mice were bred to produce an experimental cohort.

Bar heights represent mean raw area under the curve (AUC) values across all CC-F1s.
