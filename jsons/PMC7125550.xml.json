            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), is a highly contagious viral disease of the chicken [1]. Since IB was first described by Schalk and Hawn in USA in 1931 [2], it has developed into one of the foremost causes of economic loss in the poultry industry, affecting the performance of both meat-type and egg-laying chickens. IBV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, classified taxonomically as a member of genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae [3]. Initially, this pathogen replicated primarily in the respiratory tract, causing a highly contagious respiratory disease characterized by nasal discharge, snicking, rales, and tracheal ciliostasis in chickens, but later reports demonstrated that it also replicated in many other epithelial surfaces, including enteric surfaces, oviducts, and kidneys [4]. Although vaccination is the most reliable approach to control IBV, the high mutation rate and recombination events differentiate IBV into numerous genotypes and serotypes, causing poor cross-protection of vaccines [5]. Therefore, it is urgent to apply new technologies and methods to control IBV.",

MiRNAs usually affect gene expression by directing repressive protein complexes to the untranslated region (UTR) of target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. Up to now, Out of over 24,000 miRNAs have been identified, including 734 mature miRNAs from Gallus gallus [6,7] and even 295 mature miRNAs encoded by viruses [Mirbase]. These huge amounts of miRNAs are implicated in almost every cellular process, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and host-pathogen interactions [8]. Especially, in viral infections, miRNAs have been confirmed play crucial regulatory roles. For instance, miRNA-4776 was related to the survival of influenza virus [9]. MiR-3470b promoted bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) replication in baby hamster Syrian kidney cells [10] and bta-miR-2361 inhibited bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV1) replication by directly targeting EGR1 gene [11]. IBV, as a virus that affects the global poultry industry, has been studied from various angles. However, few studies have reported about the miRNAs alterations in the post infection of IBV in host cell lines, such as HD11 cell line.",

Our results shown that gga-miR-30d was a key regulator of IBV infection. Furthermore, gga-miR-30d regulated the replication of IBV by targeting the 3\u2032-UTR of USP47. USP47 encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) in cells, and its role in viral infection is gradually emerging [16].

Recent reports indicate that HD11, a chicken macrophage-like cell line, is susceptible to IBV Beaudette strain [21]. To study the role of gga-miR-30d in chicken cell innate immunity, HD11 was been used as the infection platform. The cells were infected with IBV at a MOI of 10 and harvested at indicated time points (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60 h). IFA and virus titers were performed to analyze the status of IBV in HD11 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B. IBV titers began to increase rapidly after 12 h of infection, and at about 36 h after infection, the virus titers reached the maximum (106.067 TCID50/mL). IBV Beaudette strain replication in HD11 cells was also studied by performing an immunofluorescence assay. IFA (Fig. 1A) revealed a strong green fluorescence signal observed in cells after 24 h of infection. No fluorescence signal was observed in the control group. This indicates that HD11 as a chicken source cell line is a suitable platform for IBV proliferation, at least for IBV Beaudette strain.",

There is lack of lymph nodes and resident macrophages in avian respiratory tract, thus requiring an infux of phagocytic cells to initiate the defense against infectious agents [22].
