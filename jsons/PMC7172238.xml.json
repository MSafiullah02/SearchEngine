The acute exercise-induced increase in IL-6 after heavy exertion (e.g., typically above 5pg/mL, 10pg/mL, and 50pg/mL following 1-h, 2-h, and marathon race running bouts, respectively) may indeed orchestrate anti-inflammatory influences, lipolysis, and improved insulin sensitivity, but this amount of physical activity is beyond levels achievable by most overweight/obese individuals.",

As with URTI, multiple lifestyle approaches to reducing chronic inflammation should be employed with a focus on weight loss, high volume of physical activity, avoidance of smoking, and improved diet quality.",
