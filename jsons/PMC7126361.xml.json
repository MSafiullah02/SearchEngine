The etiological agent, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), is a member of the genus Pestivirus, which belongs to the family Flaviviridae [1], [2]. CSFV is a small, enveloped virus with a 12.5-kb positive, single-stranded RNA genome containing a single large open reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor, which is cleaved co- and post-translationally by cellular and viral proteases into structural and nonstructural proteins [3]. Both ends of the genome are flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR), which are highly conserved among all of the virus isolates [4], [5], [6], [7]. The 5\u2032 UTR functions as an internal ribosomal entry site for translation initiation of the pre-polyprotein and genome replication [8].",

            "text": "The disease was endemic in many areas of the world during the last decades. Although some countries applied an eradication policy for infected animals, this strategy decreased the risks rather than eliminated CSF. Furthermore, prenatal infection of fetuses could lead to persistently infected animals which shed virus over a long period of time, as did pigs which exhibit the chronic form of disease or no clear clinical symptoms [9], [10]. A rapid diagnosis based solely upon clinical signs is difficult and can result in late detection [11]. Rapid and pre-clinical laboratory diagnosis of CSFV is therefore a matter of urgency in order to prevent and control the epidemics. Current methods for diagnosis of CSFV rely on virus isolation [12], fluorescent antibody technique [13], enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [14], [15], RT-PCR [7], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and real-time RT-PCR [21]. RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR procedures are generally considered to be the most sensitive in vitro method for detecting CSFV infection. However, this technique requires centralized laboratory facilities and clinical specimen submissions, which delay disease diagnosis, thus affecting the efficiency of emergency disease management.",

The most significant advantage of LAMP is the ability to amplify specific DNA sequences under an invariable temperature between 63 \u00b0C and 65 \u00b0C and enable visual judgment within 60 min, besides its highly sensitivity and specificity. The method had been successfully applied to detect human influenza A virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Japanese encephalitis virus [23], [24], [25]. But RT-LAMP for detecting CSF has not been reported so far and a rapid pre-clinical diagnosis at the site of any suspected disease outbreak would be extremely useful for controlling CSF in endemic countries.
