Furthermore, Chen & Fu [8] studied an effective antiviral treatment with prescribing behaviour and resistance evolution. Remarkably, influenza-like illnesses, Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) [9] is a widely used ex post treatment originally administered against influenza A and B viruses. However, over the years, the societal benefits of antiviral treatment have lessened with overuse, leading to treatment resistance. These trends are evidenced by the interplay between prescription behaviour and resistance evolution. Here, the theoretical studies of vaccination and treatment strategies have considered different effectiveness, associated costs, payoff structures and time scales.",

In these designations, S, I, R, E and Q represent the proportions of susceptible, infected, recovered, exposed and quarantined individuals, respectively. Recently, Kabir et al. extended the simple SIR model by introducing an awareness effect on epidemic spreading and implemented a two-layer SIR-UA model on well-mixed [15] and heterogeneous networks [16]. Additionally, treatment is an important compartmented state that reduces the disease after infection. Treatments such as antibiotics, quarantine and isolation have been theoretically investigated by many researchers [17\u201326]. The consequences of vaccination and treatment on an epidemic model were investigated in an influenza model with age structure by Qiu & Feng [27,28] and Feng et al. [29], an SIVS model with vaccination age by Li et al. [30], an SIR epidemic model with optimal control theory by Zaman et al. [31] and a pandemic influenza model by Towers et al. [32]. All these works presumed that vaccination, quarantine or treatment would reduce epidemic infection in a simple dynamical situation on local time scales and with no game aspect. By contrast, the present study aims to establish a theoretical epidemic model encompassing both vaccination and treatment as an evolutionary game approach.",

According to prior studies, a game approach to epidemiological vaccination can fairly predict the infection risk in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals [49\u201352]. Such voluntary vaccination game approaches have been studied theoretically and in multi-agent simulations (MAS). To elucidate the mechanism of infectious-disease control, these approaches incorporate a two-layer time scale: a local time scale (epidemic season) of epidemic diffusion and a global time scale on which the strategy updates at the end of the season (at local equilibrium), followed by repeated seasons. Kuga & Tanimoto [53] developed a theoretical model of imperfect vaccination on local and global time scales and validated it by MAS. However, Kabir & Tanimoto [54] claimed that an individual's decision to take a vaccination after social learning (dynamical behaviour) also occurs on local time scales, so this strategy should be updated instantly. Accordingly, it seems that the voluntary vaccination game approach can be implemented into the local time scale while maintaining the framework on the global time scale (strategy update at the end of each season). In the same context, antiviral treatment depends on the local time scale, antiviral resistance and prescribing behaviour.",

            "text": "To shed light on this complex phenomenon, we newly propose the dual-dilemma game structure that considers the roles of both the proactive vaccination and retroactive treatment games. This approach admits different strategy update rules and different time scales of the two provisions. In most of the previous studies [5,6,39\u201341,49\u201353], the proactive vaccination permits an individual to accept or decline a vaccination at the end of every epidemic season. This repeated choice is made on global time scales. On the other hand, the retroactive treatment prescribes the behaviour and the antiviral resistance of a certain individual only when s/he is actually infected at a certain time in an epidemic season, which occurs on local time scales. An excessive antiviral treatment may also trigger another viral resistant strain; this behaviour is an expected social problem concerning seasonal influenza in Japan [55]. In this case, the so-called vaccination dilemma modelled by the vaccination game is joined by another dilemma, whereby an individual seeking to use public goods (i.e. accepting the antiviral) induces another viral strain with devastating consequences for others. Using our novel idea backed by the theoretical game approach, we quantify the impact of the pre-emptive vaccination game (before the disease spreading) and the treatment game (after the infection), which includes the prescribing behaviour as an ex post provision. Both games are influenced by vaccine effectiveness, treatment efficacy, treatment cost and vaccination cost. Such a double social dilemma situation, perhaps quite ubiquitous in the real world, has not been considered in related previous studies. The vaccination game in the double-dilemma scenario occurs on a larger time scale (over repeated seasons) than the treatment game, which occurs on a day-by-day basis. Therefore, a coevolutionary process can be plausibly modelled in the present study. We employ a pre-emptive control measure that prevents the breakout of infection at an early stage based on an individual's decision. Meanwhile, the ex post treatment can be regarded as a fail-safe provision implemented after infection. Owing to the imperfections of vaccines and the unwillingness to take vaccines as a pre-emptive provision, people probably consider a retroactive treatment as the \u2018ultimate weapon\u2019 against disease dispersion. However, overuse of antiviral treatment and prescribing behaviour can trigger the emergence of resistant strains, encouraging more ex post provision activity by individuals. To handle these two provisions working on different time scales, our model implants the second social dilemma incurred by the antiviral treatment rather than the so-called vaccination dilemma acquired by the proactive provision. To our knowledge, no previous theoretical analysis has considered two provisions in the same context of the evolutionary game process. We also develop another new concept called the social efficiency deficit (SED). Such a framework can explicitly elucidate the social dual-dilemma on both global (vaccination) and local (treatment) time scales.",

Here, we emphasize the social learning behaviour for prescription of antiviral treatment under the evolutionary dynamics of resistance that can uphold the optimal use of the treatment. To explore this evolutionary process of vaccination and treatment, we impose three strategy update rules: individual-based risk assessment (IB-RA), society-based risk assessment (SB-RA) and direct commitment (DC). These rules govern the individual's connection with society. Moreover, we derive the control reproduction numbers of the sensitive and resistant strains, and hence analyse the disease-free equilibria situations in an epidemic.",

            "text": "To model the social dual-dilemma as a two-stage game, the pre-emptive vaccination and ex post treatment are developed in the framework of SIR epidemic dynamics in a well-mixed population (figure 1). In stage 1, the individuals make their vaccination decisions (yes or no) that will control their infection risk during the pandemic season. In stage 2, the infected people with either the sensitive strain or resistant strain decide their treatment provision (treated or untreated) on the local time scale. The antiviral (antibiotic) treatment case incorporates a feedback loop between the prescription behaviour and resistance evolution. To model the disease diffusion in a single season, the initially susceptible people are compartmentalized into vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. The individuals in the susceptible state can be infected with either sensitive or resistant strains, then seek treatment at an overall treatment rate (treatment probability) denoted as \u03c9P , where P is the prescribing rate and \u03c9 determines the probability at which infected people accept treatment from the prescribing individuals. Consequently, the individuals can recover in two ways: natural recovery with no antibiotic/antiviral treatment or recovery after treatment. The epidemiological dynamics are described by the following system of ordinary differential equations\n2.1S\u02d9=\u2212\u03b2sS(Isenu+(1\u2212\u03b5)T)\u2212\u03b2rS(Iresu+\u03b5T),\n2.2V\u02d9=\u2212\u03b2s(V(t)\u2212eV(0))(Isenu+(1\u2212\u03b5)T)\u2212\u03b2r(V(t)\u2212eV(0))(Iresu+\u03b5T),\n2.3I\u02d9senu=\u03b2sS(Isenu+(1\u2212\u03b5)T)+\u03b2s(V(t)\u2212eV(0))(Isenu+(1\u2212\u03b5)T)\u2212\u03c9PIsenu\u2212\u03b2s\u03bcsS(Isenu+(1\u2212\u03b5)T)+\u03b2r\u03bcrS(Iresu+\u03b5T)\u2212\u03b3sIsenu,\n2.4I\u02d9resu=\u03b2rS(Iresu+\u03b5T)+\u03b2r(V(t)\u2212eV(0))(Iresu+\u03b5T)\u2212\u03c9PIresu+\u03b2s\u03bcsS(Isenu+(1\u2212\u03b5)T)\u2212\u03b2r\u03bcrS(Iresu+\u03b5T)\u2212\u03b3rIresu,\n2.5T\u02d9=\u03c9PIsenu+\u03c9PIresu\u2212\u03b3TT\n2.6andR\u02d9=\u03b3TT+\u03b3sIsenu+\u03b3rIresu.\n",

A typical scenario is demonstrated in figure 7. Our idea was motivated by the endorsement of social dilemma situations in the strategies of evolutionary game theory, in which the players are all individuals in a well-mixed population. In a coevolutionary adaptation process, it is important to know whether the social dual-dilemma exists under certain combinations of the model parameters, such as the vaccination effectiveness, treatment efficiency and their associated costs. Unlike simple 2 by 2 games in which the so-called dilemma strength (DS) can be explicitly defined [1], a real social dilemma typically observed in the vaccination game [2,5\u20137,36\u201344], traffic flow [46\u201352] and others may have a time-variable game structure. In the vaccination and traffic games, this structure is mainly influenced by the disease-spreading and traffic flow dynamics, respectively. The time-variable game structure is too complex to represent by the payoff matrix in a 2 \u00d7 2 game or the time-constant payoff structure function in the 2-strategy and n-player game. Thus, the DS is difficult to determine in advance even when the mathematical model is well defined. Our new SED concept (defined above and mathematically formulated blow) was inspired by the seminal idea of traffic flow analysis (e.g. [56\u201362]). The DS indicates the existence or absence of a social dilemma (behaving as a prognostic index), whereas the SED provides an \u2018ex post\u2019 or diagnostic index. Here, let us define SED as the gap between the result of the evolutionary trail (which can be evaluated by the Nash equilibrium (NE)) and the optimum solution (ideal result from a social-welfare standpoint [63]). The payoff at the NE can always be observed by taking an evolutionary game approach, whereas the optimal social payoff is observable in a model of any complexity. Therefore, one can evaluate the SED in any context, and hence predict the occurrence of a social dilemma (if the SED is positive, the gap exists; if it is zero, the evolutionary trail matches the optimum). Thus, the SED indicates that the payoff can be improved from that at the NE. Mathematically, the SED is given by\n3.1SED=(social optimal payoff) \u2212 (payoff at Nash equilibrium)\n",

Construct the ASP phase diagram based on the evolutionary game approach (figure 7(i)). To this end, implement both the vaccination and treatment games and obtain the appropriate ASP at the NE, along with a certain vaccine effectiveness (e) and treatment efficacy (\u03b5). The ASP associated with the fraction of vaccinators and probability of treatment (xl, pk) at the NE can also be observed for a precise (ei, \u03b5j).Step 2. For this fixed (ei, \u03b5j), evaluate ASPei,\u03b5j|pkxsocialopt. while constraining P at pk and the maximal ASP is evaluated by varying x under the default setting. Likewise evaluate ASPei,\u03b5j|xlPsocialopt while constraining x at xl (figure 7(ii)).Step 3.

Panels A and B of figure 8 are plotted under the strategy update rules IB-RA and SB-RA, respectively, and plots (a-*) and (b-*) present the SEDs in the vaccination game SEDv and the treatment game SEDT, respectively. Moreover, the combined vaccination and treatment costs (Cr, CT) were varied as (0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.9), (0.9, 0.1) (0.1, 0.1), and (0.9, 0.9) in plots (*-i), (*-ii), (*-iii) and (*-iv), respectively. As demonstrated in the above SED formulation, the dilemma situation (non-white areas in the plots) appeared in all cases, but interestingly depended on e and \u03b5. No-dilemma regions, in which either the vaccination or treatment game became trivial, were also observed. Now, comparing panels (a-i) and (a-ii) for Cr = 0.1 with panels (a-iii) and (a-iv) for Cr = 0.9, one finds that the non-dilemma region (whiteout region) expanded with increasing vaccination cost. At the smaller vaccination cost (Cr = 0.1), the region of larger SED appeared at a relatively low vaccination effectiveness (around e = 0.4; dotted red box in panel (a-i)). The huge gap between NE and the social optimal results from the lower NE due to a lower efficiency which makes fewer people commit vaccination when compared with a situation allowing a relatively higher efficiency which makes much more people commit. By contrast, a relatively high vaccination efficiency entices people to vaccinate, thus increasing the NE. Meanwhile, increasing the vaccination cost (Cr = 0.9) shifted the region of reasonably high SED to the maximally high vaccination effectiveness (dotted blue box in panel (a-iv)). This occurred because despite the high vaccination effectiveness, low vaccination efficiency hampers the commitment to vaccination. Reliable vaccination provides a high commitment incentive, but high cost encourages free-riding on the herd immunity of the devoted others. In summary, we have numerically demonstrated that the SED precisely and easily detects the social dilemma in our dual-dilemma coevolutionary model.\n",

The vaccination game implements on the global time scale under two strategy adaptation rules: IB-RA and SB-RA, assuming an infinite and well-mixed population. Meanwhile, the treatment game describes the behaviour of antiviral administration with resistant-strain emergence. The treatment game is updated on the local time scale by presuming the DC rule, and precisely integrating a feedback loop between the sensitive and resistant strains. The outcome of antiviral and vaccination use depends on the effectiveness of the vaccine, the efficiency of treatment and their corresponding costs. Increasing the effectiveness of the vaccine and lowering its administration cost reduced the final epidemic size (increased vaccination coverage). Lowering the treatment cost and enhancing the treatment efficacy exerted a similar effect. Thus, by applying retroactive antiviral use with pre-emptive vaccination, we can deeply understand and investigate individual decisions regarding vaccination and implement proper strategies that lessen the diffusion of infection or recommend appropriate and careful administration of both antivirals and vaccination. We also introduced the social optimum point Pc that distinguishes the conditions under which treatment resistance emerges under antibiotic overuse and its associated factors.",

Presuming seasonal influenza-like diseases, the (pre-emptive) vaccination works over repeated seasons on global time scales, whereas the ex post treatment works seasonally on local time scales and depends on the antiviral cost, prescription behaviour and resistant-strain emergence. In the present model, we successfully established a \u2018double-layer\u2019 game structure of pre-emptive vaccination and ex post treatment. Unlike the vaccination game model, which only considers whether the vaccine is accepted or declined, and whether an ex post provision is taken in a single season, the treatment game includes an aspect that depends on the antiviral resistance evolution and prescribing behaviour. To explicitly prove the dual-dilemma situation in the \u2018double-layer\u2019 game, we proposed the SED indicator, which quantifies whether the dynamics develop a social dilemma structure. This indicator is measured by the gap between the NE and the social optimal state. The dilemma strength [64\u201366], which explains the dilemma structure in simple two-player and two-strategy (2 \u00d7 2) games, is too simplistic for realistic dilemma games with substantially complex and time-dependent structures, such as vaccination games and traffic flow analysis. However, SED can quantify whether a game intrinsically has a social dilemma or not. We applied the SED to the present social dual-dilemma game, in which both vaccination and treatment dilemmas are inevitable.",
