We reviewed the published assessments of the economic costs of human seasonal and pandemic influenza internationally. Seasonal influenza costs Germany, France, and the USA between $4 and $87 billion annually. Depending upon the intensity of transmission and severity of disease, pandemic influenza may cause as many as 350 million deaths and result in economic losses topping $1 trillion -an impact great enough to create a worldwide recession. We then reviewed 100 papers primarily from more than a dozen countries which studied the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccine in children, adults, and the elderly. These studies demonstrate that influenza vaccination is quite cost-effective among children 6 months to 18 years old, in health care workers and pregnant women, and in high-risk individuals.",

In addition to the health care costs incurred by sick patients needing outpatient care and hospitalization, the societal costs of lost productivity and ancillary costs are substantial. When children become ill, parents take time off from work to care for them and take them for treatment. Ill employees are absent from work, and even when present in the workplace, their productivity can be substantially reduced, while increasing the risk of transmission to coworkers. Retirees suffer some of the most severe complications of influenza and may require more assistance from family members and informal caregivers resulting in societal costs that exceed the usual medical expenditures.",

Although there are several strategies to address the spread of influenza, the low cost and relatively good efficacy (25-85%) of vaccination mean that it is still preferred over other measures such as targeted antiretroviral therapy and, in more extreme cases, quarantine of those who are ill and their susceptible associates through closure of schools and workplaces [15] . This review focuses on vaccination against influenza in the main target groups: children, elderly, and adults.",

The target age group for vaccination varied from day care center attendees, school children, and all children 6 months to 18 years. Some of the studies included only illness in those children in the target age group receiving the vaccine; others included secondary cases in families and general population averted resulting from childhood vaccination.
