The major workhorse for protein expression has been Escherichia coli, and today a very large number of expression plasmids and specialized strains, each with its own merits, exist for this prokaryotic host. The overwhelming majority of protein entries in the PBD (http://www.rcsb.org/) originate from heterologous production in E. coli. However, the increasing trend towards the study of more complex biological assemblies, sometimes with 10 or more subunits, has necessitated the development of more powerful eukaryotic expression systems that offer access to multiprotein complexes, which for a variety of reasons (large subunit size, requirement of post translational modifications and chaperones, others) cannot be made efficiently in E. coli. The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS), introduced more than 20 years ago, has recently emerged as a particularly useful tool for producing large eukaryotic protein complexes in the quantity and quality required for detailed structural study.",

BEVS has remained for some time a relatively specialized application, but has entered mainstream in structural biology laboratories in the past several years. Engineering of the baculovirus genome towards improved protein complex production characteristics, the development of new plasmids and stream-lined methods for multigene assembly and integration into the baculovirus genome, and the establishment of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for cell culture maintenance, virus generation, infection and protein production have resulted in the MultiBac system, a BEVS that is particularly easy-to-use and sufficiently robust to be employed on a routine basis by users who do not possess specialist training [1\u2022]. These are critically important considerations for the use of BEVS in structural biology laboratories, where the overriding objective is protein sample preparation for structure analysis, and the investment in optimizing individual expression experiments necessarily needs to stay within a reasonably short timeframe. MultiBac has been instrumental for producing a number of multiprotein complexes that could not be accessed before for structural and functional studies. Recent examples of such multiprotein complexes are provided in the following, including the Head module of the Mediator from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast anaphase promoting complex APC/C, and the human general transcription factor TFIID core complex, each of which highlighting different aspects of BEVS application that were exploited to achieve successful structure determination.",

Mediator is structurally and functionally conserved in all eukaryotes [3, 4]. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, where it was first discovered [5], Mediator comprises 21 subunits with a combined molecular mass exceeding 1 MDa [6, 7]. Mediator functions as an interface between DNA-bound protein activators of transcription and Pol II [2, 8, 9]. Of medical relevance, the mutations on several human Mediator subunits have been linked to neurological disorders and cancers [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of Mediator function is a major research subject in biomedical sciences. Despite its paramount importance in gene regulation, the large size, complexity, and low abundance of Mediator have made biochemical and structural studies extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a long time.",

Unlike Pol II, which adopts a compact globular structure, Mediator from yeast is composed of three distinct modules [17, 18], termed Head, Middle, and Tail (Figure 1\n). As suggested by structural, genetic and biochemical studies [19, 20, 21], the modules consist of 7\u20139 individual subunits each (Figure 1a). Mediator has multiple activities [5], and each module is thought to perform its own defined set of functions [22]. For example, the subunits from the Head module genetically interact with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II [23, 24], while several Middle and Tail module subunits have been shown to directly interact with transcriptional activators [9, 21, 25, 26, 27]. A reasonable strategy therefore is to address particular Mediator functions by studying the modules individually as first steps towards deciphering the overall mechanism of the whole complex. While still a formidable challenge, this approach certainly reduces the otherwise intimidating complexity of studying Mediator structure and function.",

Highly expressing baculoviruses were carefully isolated and optimized for maximum expression, and then used in combination to co-infect insect cell cultures. This procedure was exceedingly lengthy (each experiment taking two months or more) and complicated logistics as seven viruses had to be maintained at high titers simultaneously in parallel. X-ray crystallography, however, requires rapid turnover of expression experiments. Often, the production of a large number of variants of the protein or complex studied is necessary, to identify the sample which produces diffraction quality crystals, and this must be within a timeframe that is as short as feasible.",

All genes encoding for the Mediator Head subunits were thus combined into a single construct by TR (Figure 1b) [29, 30\u2022\u2022], significantly reducing experimental complexity. The multigene construct was next integrated into the engineered MultiBac baculovirus genome that is characterized by reduced proteolysis and delayed host cell lysis, thus improving the quality of the sample produced [1\u2022].

Incorporation of seleno-methionine in the recombinantly produced sample was instrumental for structure elucidation. The crystal structure of the Mediator Head reveals how this essential complex is built from its components combining stability as well as flexibility for transcription regulation, providing a platform for other transcription factors [30\u2022\u2022]. New features in the structure provide first impressions about architectural design principles of such large multiprotein machines. Notably, a portion of the Head named \u2018neck domain\u2019 confers stability and integrity of the complex by forming a novel multihelical bundle, engaging five of the seven subunits of the Head simultaneously in one compact structural unit (Figure 1c).",

Because most APC/C subunits are essential, genetic manipulations were intrinsically difficult, and the low natural abundance of APC/C limited structural and biochemical studies. The recent development of overexpression systems for S. cerevisiae and human APC/C [34\u2022\u2022, 35], based on the MultiBac BEVS that reconstitutes all APC/C proteins, now enables a range of structural, biochemical and biophysical investigations. The expression and reconstitution of recombinant S. cerevisiae APC/C [34\u2022\u2022] used the first generation MultiBac cloning system for insect cell-baculovirus expression [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. To express S. cerevisiae APC/C, two viruses encoding five and eight subunits were combined for co-expression. The resultant recombinant co-expression system yielded \u223c200-fold more intact APC/C than the endogenous system (0.5 mg/L insect cell culture). The reconstituted S. cerevisiae APC/C was correctly assembled, as judged by its structural correspondence to native APC/C (Figure 2\na and b), and its capacity to ubiquitinate mitotic cyclin in the presence of coactivator in a D box and KEN box dependent manner [34\u2022\u2022]. The ability to recapitulate the endogenous APC/C catalytic and regulatory activity using recombinant reconstituted APC/C provided strong evidence that the molecular composition of S. cerevisiae APC/C had been completely defined, a crucial prerequisite for understanding the complete system.",

An APC/C subcomplex of eight subunits was analyzed using native mass spectrometry and measured as 698.8 kDa, in good agreement with that predicted for a complex containing all subunits in unit stoichiometry plus an additional copy of Cdc23 [34\u2022\u2022]. Generation of APC/C subcomplexes, guided by an architectural map of the APC/C [42], and subsequent determination of their EM structures allowed the assignment of the three-dimensional molecular boundaries of individual subunits within the APC/C molecular envelope. As an example, comparing two APC/C subcomplexes differing by Cdc16\u2013Cdc26 indicated difference density that corresponded closely to the crystal structure of the Cdc16\u2013Cdc26 heterotetramer (Figure 2c) [43]. This subunit deletion approach allowed a systematic assignment of the majority of large APC/C subunits and by integrating crystal structures, and homology models of individual APC/C subunits, with a cryo-EM reconstruction of an APC/CCdh1\u2022D-box ternary complex at 10 \u00c5 resolution [44], a high-resolution description of the subunit organization and pseudo-atomic model of the APC/C was determined (Figure 2d) [34\u2022\u2022, 44]. The approach of subunit deletion employed by [34\u2022\u2022] accurately defines the molecular boundaries of specific APC/C subunits, enabling more reliable docking of subunit atomic models compared with that possible from the approximate locations of subunits defined by labeling N-termini and C-termini.",

Efforts to generate fully assembled recombinant human APC/C before the identification of Apc16 were unsuccessful [35]. This indicated that Apc16, located within the TPR subcomplex [48], is necessary for the optimal assembly of recombinant human APC/C in insect cells. Thus, the successful assembly and reconstitution of human APC/C using the insect cell/baculovirus expression system indicated that all human APC/C subunits necessary for a functional and catalytically active APC/C had finally been identified (Figure 2e and f).",

Mad3 coordinates the overall organization of the complex by forming numerous inter-subunit interactions with Mad2 and Cdc20.

Owing to evolutionary conservation and overall similarity in shape of the yeast and human TFIID complexes, this subunit composition is probably to be present in TFIID from most species. The concept emerged in which TAFs present in duplicate form a putative, 2-fold symmetric scaffold, around which the remaining TAFs and TBP organize as peripheral subunits [52], suggesting that a transition from symmetry to asymmetry may occur in the TFIID assembly pathway. Compelling functional support for this bipartite architectural design came from studies in Drosophila cells [55]. By means of RNAi to knockdown specific TAFs, a stable and functional core-TFIID complex, composed of TAF4, 5, 6, 9 and 12, was revealed in vivo. Further support stems from cryo-EM studies of TFIID preparations from yeast, in which a quasi-symmetric smaller shape was also found [56]. Together, these results point to the existence of a symmetric core-TFIID module of pivotal importance for the integrity and assembly of holo-TFIID.",

The structure revealed a symmetric arrangement of the subunits, validating previous experiments. Initially, the TFIID core complex was produced by using a single baculovirus containing the encoding genes arranged as a multigene construct made up of individual expression cassettes [36], similar to the strategy adopted for the successful study of the Mediator Head module from S. cerevisiae [30\u2022\u2022]. In the case of core-TFIID, however, it turned out that the expression levels of the individual subunits varied substantially, thus reducing overall yield of the recombinant complex dramatically. Large amounts of heterologous protein was produced in excess while the subunit characterized by the lowest expression level relative to the others dictated the final amount of properly assembled complex containing all subunits. A rescue strategy involving tagging of this weakly expressing subunit with an affinity tag did result in the purification of complete core-TFIID, however, EM analysis revealed the presence of smaller subassemblies lacking subunits that were contaminating the sample, impeding structure determination.",

These viruses express long open-reading frames (ORFs) that are translated into large polyproteins. These polyproteins are then processed into individual proteins by a highly specific protease that cuts proteolytic sites in between the functional polypeptide entities. Typically, the protease is also part of the polyprotein, and liberates itself as well by means of proteolytic cleavage. This strategy was implemented in the MultiBac system by creating long single ORFs composed of the TAF genes. The gene encoding for NIa protease from Tobacco etch virus (TEV) was added at the 5\u2032, and corresponding recognition and cleavage sequences were inserted [1\u2022, 41]. To follow and quantify polyprotein production during expression, the gene encoding for a fluorescent protein was appended to the 3\u2032 end of the ORF (Figure 3a). The TEV NIa protease proved to be sufficiently specific to process the polyproteins expressed properly and to completion. This resulted in a fully balanced level of the TAF proteins resulting from polyprotein processing that assembled completely into the TFIID core complex. Core-TFIID was purified to homogeneity, enabling high-resolution structure determination (Figure 3b and c). Expression of two further TAFs, TAF8 and TAF10, likewise from a polyprotein construction, and incorporation into the core-TFIID complex followed by cryo-EM structure determination, allowed to propose a molecular mechanisms of TFIID rearrangement during assembly when the symmetric core accretes further TAFs and TBP, giving rise to the complete holo-complex that is asymmetric [57\u2022\u2022].",

Native mass spectrometry that allows determination of subunit stoichiometry and insights into multimeric complex assembly processes is also dependent on highly concentrated, high quality sample in defined buffer conditions [58]. Highly homogenous specimens are likewise required for functional studies and for pharmaceutical applications.
