Moreover, newfound hantaviruses harbored by soricomorphs of multiple species, distributed in widely separated geographic regions across four continents, suggest that their host diversity may be far more expansive than previously assumed. Specifically, other mammals having shared ancestry or ecosystems with soricomorphs may serve as reservoirs and may be important in the evolutionary history and diversification of hantaviruses. In particular, bats (order Chiroptera) may be potential reservoirs by virtue of their rich diversity and vast geographical range, as well as their demonstrated ability to host myriad medically important, disease-causing viruses [14-18]. Surprisingly little attention, however, has been paid to this possibility.",

Each reaction mixture contained 250 \u03bc dNTP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 U AmpliTaq polymerase (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 0.25 \u03bc oligonucleotide primers. Initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min was followed by two cycles each of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 40 s, two-degree step-down annealing from 48\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C for 40 s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 1 min or 1 min 20 s, then 32 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 40 s, annealing at 42\u00b0C for 40 s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 1 min, in a GeneAmp PCR 9700 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA).

Thus, while it is likely that many more hantaviruses await discovery, overcoming technical barriers is essential to facilitating their detection. Viewed in this context, the failure to detect hantavirus RNA in all but one bat species was not altogether unexpected and may be attributed simply to suboptimal primer design and imperfect cycling conditions. Also, low RNA yields and poor RNA preservation in tissues fixed in ethanol under field conditions may have thwarted our efforts at obtaining more of the MOUV genome. That said, the successful amplification of hantavirus RNA from ethanol-fixed tissues is highly instructive and augments the pool of archival tissues for future exploratory studies of hantaviruses in bats, and possibly other insectivorous small mammals that share ancestral lineages with soricomorphs, such as hedgehogs (order Erinaceomorpha, family Erinaceidae).",

However, lung is not the only tissue in which hantaviruses can be detected [27,31]. In our search of genetically distinct hantaviruses in long-stored archival tissues from shrews and moles, lung tissue was frequently unavailable. Instead, liver tissue was more often accessible and proved to be quite suitable [4,5,12,13]. Similarly, liver tissues were more often available in the present study. As in reservoir rodents and soricomorphs, hantavirus RNA is likely to be present in many tissues of persistently infected bats. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of lung, liver and other viscera will clarify the tissue distribution of MOUV in newly captured banana pipistrelles from Mouyassu\u00e9.",

The banana pipistrelle, which is distributed widely in forests and savannas across sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1C, inset), is one of 13 species in the genus Neoromicia of the family Vespertilionidae and subfamily Vespertilioninae. Like other vesper bats, the banana pipistrelle is insectivorous. Unlike large fruit bats, such as the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) and hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus), which are sold as bush meat, the banana pipistrelle, weighing approximately 3 g, is not consumed as food. However, because banana pipistrelles occasionally roost within houses or reside near human habitation, rare human encounters raise the possibility of hantavirus exposure.",

In the present study, the strikingly divergent lineage of MOUV precluded any possibility of contamination and lends support to our earlier conjecture that the ancient origins of hantaviruses may have involved insect-borne viruses [7,10], with subsequent adaptation to and host switching between early soricomorph and chiropteran ancestral hosts in the mammalian superorder Laurasiatheria. However, since the biological and evolutionary implications of bats as reservoirs of hantaviruses are considerable, studies are underway to establish that the banana pipistrelle is the natural host of MOUV. Moreover, high-throughput sequencing technology is being applied to obtain the full genome of MOUV and to ascertain the geographic range and genetic diversity of hantaviruses harbored by bats.",
