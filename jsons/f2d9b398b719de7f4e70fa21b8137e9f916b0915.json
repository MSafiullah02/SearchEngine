Why did 47 states impose barriers anyway? This article argues that states use barriers as political cover to prevent a loss of domestic political support. This logic suggests that governments anticipating high domestic political benefits for imposing barriers during an outbreak will be likely to do so. Logistic regression and duration analysis of an original dataset coding state behavior during H1N1 provide support for this argument: democracies with weak health infrastructure-those that stand to gain the most from imposing barriers during an outbreak because they are particularly vulnerable to a negative public reaction-are more likely than others to impose barriers and to do so quickly.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "weeks, and on April 24, the United States (US) reported seven confirmed cases of the virus.

Despite this guidance, 47 of 193 WHO member states imposed trade or travel barriers against H1N1-affected countries. Whether or not barriers actually protect from the spread of disease, this variation in state behavior is puzzling and not easily explained by vulnerability to disease spread, geographic location, economic size, or trade ties.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 414, "end": 450, "text": "(World Health Organization 2009a, e)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "State behavior during H1N1 reflects a longstanding pattern: states have often imposed trade and travel restrictions during outbreaks that on their face seem like they would prevent disease spread, but that public health experts actually deem ineffective. 1 Importantly, the use of these barriers has an unintended consequence that makes all states more vulnerable to future outbreaks. Namely, barriers lead to a commitment problem that encourages outbreak concealment. Since states cannot credibly commit to not impose costly barriers, outbreaks are chronically underreported. Not surprisingly, states will not rapidly and transparently report outbreaks if economic harm is their reward. In an attempt to overcome this collective action problem, states revised the IHR in 2005 by delegating increased authority to the WHO. In particular, states agreed to follow the organization's recommendations about the health measures that states should (or should not) impose during an outbreak. H1N1 put the new regulations to the test for the first time and close to 25 % of states ignored WHO guidance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This article investigates the role played by domestic politics in governments' decision to either impose barriers or to follow WHO recommendations against them. Barriers are an attractive policy because they can quell public fear and instill confidence in the government by signaling to domestic constituents that the state is taking action to protect them from a potentially dangerous threat. Thus, for governments looking to counter charges of not protecting the population from disease, I argue that barriers provide Bpolitical cover.^As a result, states should be likely to impose barriers during an outbreak when they anticipate domestic political gains for doing so.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Following this logic, the central contention is that the strength of democratic institutions, together with the state's capacity to respond to the outbreak, influences the domestic political costs and benefits of imposing barriers. Specifically, democratic states should be more likely to impose barriers and disregard WHO recommendations when they have weak health infrastructure. Democracies are particularly dependent on public support and so are especially sensitive to the public's reaction to policy choices during an outbreak. And, if the outbreak crosses the border, states that lack the capacity to launch an effective response anticipate a negative public reaction to the government's handling of the outbreak. We know that democratic institutions do not always lead to international cooperation, and can sometimes actually incentivize governments to forsake institutional commitments (Dai 2006 (Dai , 2007 .

And, democracies with weak health infrastructure are more likely than others to impose barriers, and to do so quickly.

First, it overcomes the selection problem that confronts many studies of state behavior under international organizations (IOs), namely that states might only make institutional commitments that they intend to follow (Von Stein 2005) . At the time of H1N1, all states except for Liechtenstein were parties to the IHR. Therefore, because no particular type of state was more or less likely to sign on to the IHR, state parties to the regulations do not only represent the most cooperative states that are most likely to follow WHO recommendations. Second, it poses a hard test for domestic level factors. The US had one of the highest numbers of cases of H1N1 and so the vast majority of states imposing barriers targeted the US and risked antagonizing the world's most powerful state. If domestic politics matters here even when international costs should predominate-and I find that it does-then we can expect it to operate in other contexts as well.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 379, "end": 395, "text": "(Von Stein 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The study offers several contributions to existing scholarship.

Efforts to encourage rapid reporting by states often fall short, however, because they must overcome the above-described commitment problem. 2 States that discover outbreaks within their borders conceal them because other states cannot credibly commit to not impose costly barriers in response. 3 This behavior reveals that states have time-inconsistent preferences, meaning that their long and short-term preferences regarding outbreak response conflict. Though in the long run all states are in favor of limiting the use of barriers to encourage early reporting and facilitate outbreak containment, when an outbreak occurs, conditions change and states forgo this longer-term collective good by succumbing to short-term incentives to impose barriers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 225, "end": 240, "text": "(Giesecke 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Evidence of outbreak concealment due to fear of economic costs dates back to the BBlack Death^plague epidemics in medieval Europe.

This dynamic also unfolded during more recent outbreaks such as the 1991 cholera outbreak in Peru and the 1994 outbreak of plague in India (Carvalho and Zacher 2001; Cash and Narasimhan 2000) . A high profile example was China's concealment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and 2 For an overview of commitment problems in international politics and how IOs can help to mitigate them see Fearon (1998) and Abbott and Snidal (2000) . 3 Some states lack surveillance capacity and do not know that an outbreak is occurring. Not surprisingly, adequate surveillance capacity is a necessary condition for rapid outbreak reporting. The point here is that the more insidious barrier to reporting is that even when states are fully aware of an outbreak they purposefully conceal it to avoid economic costs.

Second, WHO was given the authority to Bname and shame^states for not following these recommendations. Though these recommendations are not legally binding-states can, within certain limits, impose measures that WHO does not endorse-disregarding WHO guidance against imposing barriers without compelling scientific justification clearly undermines the purpose of the IHR, which is Bto prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade( Article 1.1). Signing on to the IHR in 2005 signaled a commitment by states to uphold this goal. 5 The hope was that by creating a focal point for state behavior, and allowing WHO to monitor and publicize that behavior, states would follow WHO guidance and refrain from imposing barriers when the organization deemed they would not prevent disease spread.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "However, in spite of signing on to the revised IHR, as H1N1 makes clear, some states continue to ignore WHO guidance during outbreaks. 6 Understanding the continued use of barriers is critical to minimizing the potentially devastating consequences of these global health emergencies.

Imposing barriers can make the population feel like it is being protected and provide assurance that the government is doing all that it can, regardless of whether barriers actually prevent disease spread.

Importantly, barriers can also harm the domestic economy. Certain industry-specific interests lose out from protectionist policies. The travel and tourism industry is an obvious example since travel barriers can directly affect operations. Additionally, during H1N1, initial labeling of the disease as Bswine flu^contributed to the misconception that the disease spread through pork. As a result, most states that imposed barriers did so through import bans targeting pork products. Not surprisingly, domestic pork industries-importers in particular-opposed these policies and lobbied governments in a number of states to refrain from imposing import barriers because of the potential economic cost. Therefore, when deciding whether or not to impose trade and travel barriers, a government must weigh the political benefits of imposing barriers, which include providing political cover and protection from being Bblamed for 'failing' to protect [its] citizens^against the costs of imposing them and potentially harming the domestic economy (quotation from Buthe 2008, 91) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1464, "end": 1479, "text": "Buthe 2008, 91)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The decision to impose barriers"}, {"text": "How do governments carry out this cost-benefit analysis?

Responses are likely to be delayed and inadequate because states with weak health infrastructure lack the ability to deploy coordinated local and national containment efforts. Many citizens do not have access to health care and these states may not have the ability to correctly diagnose the disease, distribute treatment, follow up with patients after treatment, or reach others that a patient may have exposed to the disease. In short, if the disease enters the country, it is likely to cause damage, and the public will question the state's ability to protect the population and look for someone to blame.

Importantly, with the appropriate expertise, the government can let the public know about the more effective measures that the state is implementing instead of barriers. These states have better-developed surveillance and laboratory capabilities and will be able to diagnose cases and distribute a treatment more quickly and efficiently than weak health infrastructure states. Consequently, the public will have more confidence in the government's response. For example, during SARS, the government in Singapore launched a rigorous and successful response, which included effectively identifying and isolating potential cases. As a result, in April 2003 while the outbreak was ongoing, Bthree out of four Singaporeans were confident that the government could stop SARS( Institute of Medicine 2004, 256) .

Because the public's reaction to policy choices has greater political consequences for governments that are more accountable to domestic actors, the tradeoff between being seen as protecting the population and preventing economic harm is especially salient for democratic governments. More so than other states, the level of health infrastructure helps democratic states to assess whether imposing barriers is more or less politically beneficial than not doing so. Democracies with weak health infrastructure are especially dependent on maintaining public support and are not confident that the state will be able to effectively respond to the outbreak if it crosses the border. Therefore, democracies with weak health infrastructure face particularly strong incentives to impose barriers for political cover. These governments need to have a tangible action to point to later as evidence that they did all they could to protect the population. Alternatively, democracies with strong health infrastructure are more confident that they will effectively respond to the outbreak if it ends up affecting the country, and the political benefits of imposing barriers are lower for them relative to the costs of doing so.

Instead, these governments proactively impose barriers in anticipation of the public fear and demands for barriers that could develop and hurt them politically later if the outbreak enters the country and the state cannot effectively respond. Other states anticipating lower domestic political costs for not imposing barriers do not feel such pressure and can afford to bide their time to better assess the domestic and international costs and benefits they might face for imposing barriers or refraining from doing so. H1N1 provides an opportunity for examining this mechanism because WHO declared H1N1 a public health emergency and recommended against barriers soon after the outbreak was reported (CDC 2009; Nature 2009), leaving little time for public fear or demands for barriers to materialize in the interim.

Measuring preparedness is difficult because available metrics tend to focus on health spending and are not necessarily a reflection of preparedness, which depends on how money is spent, not just how much. Preparedness requires early warning and surveillance systems, laboratory and diagnostic capabilities, coordination of local and national policy and ability to implement that policy, and also communication systems to provide information to the public, not to mention human and financial resources to support these tasks (World Health Organization 2006 , 2009b . The IHR 2005 outline the capacities required for outbreak preparedness but no assessment of these capacities for each state existed at the time of H1N1. For many years thoughincluding in the lead up to the H1N1 pandemic-WHO has classified states according to their capability to diagnose type A influenza virus, which includes H1N1. I use this classification to code a binary variable for health infrastructure. I code the 86 states that were able to diagnose influenza type A virus in humans before the H1N1 outbreak as having strong health infrastructure and the remaining 107 as having weak health infrastructure (World Health Organization 2009c). Although diagnostic capability does not capture the full range of requirements for outbreak preparedness, it is a necessary condition. Rapid detection is the most effective way to contain an outbreak, and diagnostic capability plays a central role (Snacken et al. 1999 ). If countries cannot get over the diagnostic hurdle, disease detection will be delayed and perhaps inaccurate, hampering the effectiveness of other response capacities that might exist, including attempts to develop a vaccine and treatment. WHO emphasizes the importance of diagnostic capability for preparedness, noting that the laboratories tasked with diagnosing influenza have been the Bbackbone of WHO's Global Influenza Surveillance Network for more than 50 years\u2026 [and] have a key role in detecting viruses with pandemic potential, thus facilitating responses to outbreaks and preparedness for pandemics^(World Health Organization 2009d). The importance of diagnostic capabilities was also clear during H1N1. In its assessment of Peru's response, for example, the US government writes, Bwhile the Peruvian healthcare system has many weaknesses, its biggest challenge with the H1N1 outbreak has been to meet the testing demands^(McKinley 2009). The importance of diagnostic capability for overall outbreak preparedness makes it a good measure for my purposes.

The first examines whether the quality of health infrastructure alone affects the imposition of barriers (H1), the second includes an interaction term to evaluate the hypothesis that the magnitude of the effect of health infrastructure should be greater as democratic institutions strengthen and 11 Imputation is not compatible with clustering standard errors. Because clustering is particularly likely in time-series cross-sectional data, I use listwise deletion for Model 7 and cluster standard errors by country. To account for potential clustering in the other models, the Online Appendix presents results for the following: Models 1 through 3 using a generalized estimation equation (GEE) that allows for dependence within regional clusters (Zorn 2001) and Models 4, 5, and 6 using listwise deletion and clustering standard errors by country (see Tables A6 and A10). governments become increasingly reliant on maintaining public support (H2), and the third demonstrates that the findings are robust to alternative explanations. 12 The results provide compelling evidence that governments impose barriers to avoid domestic political costs. Model 1 shows that, all else equal, states with strong health infrastructure are less likely to impose barriers than states with weak health infrastructure. Importantly, however, Model 2 provides support for the argument's key expectation-that the effect of the quality of health infrastructure is conditional on the level of democracy. Indeed, there is a significant negative interaction between the quality of health infrastructure and democracy-health infrastructure has the strongest influence in electorally accountable states where governments are especially reliant on maintaining popular support. The statistical and substantive significance of interaction terms and logit coefficients cannot be interpreted directly. Therefore, Fig. 1 presents first differences in the simulated predicted probability of imposing barriers moving from states with strong to weak health infrastructure as democratic institutions strengthen. 13 At each level of Democracy from \u221210 to 10, the figure shows how much more (or less) likely a state with weak health infrastructure is to impose barriers than one with strong health infrastructure. 12 Akaike information criterion for Table 2 Figures 1 and 2 based on Model 2.

The cases of Jordan and Colombia illustrate this dynamic. Jordan, which has weak health infrastructure, imposed a pork import ban in response to H1N1 that was aimed at insulating the government from criticism rather than protecting the population from the outbreak. Jordanian imports of US pork products in the year prior to H1N1 were negligible and consisted only of frozen or heat-treated rather than fresh products. Yet, in early May 2009, the country imposed an import ban on only fresh pork products and not on frozen or heat-treated products from the US and publicized the ban in the Jordanian press. Not only did Jordan make the bans public, but the government ensured that these barriers would not actually impact the pork product imports coming from the US (as trivial as they were). This suggests that the action was a political maneuver and corroborates statements by the Assistant Secretary General for Animal Welfare Fig. 3 Ratios of simulated hazard rates of states with weak health infrastructure to those with strong health infrastructure as democratic institutions strengthen from Jordan's Ministry of Agriculture that the ban was Ba precaution^because of Bpublic pressure and fear^ (Beecroft 2009a, b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1311, "end": 1330, "text": "(Beecroft 2009a, b)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1041, "end": 1047, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "The timing of barriers"}, {"text": "Alternatively, Colombia, a democracy (Polity score equals 7) with strong health infrastructure was considering a pork imports ban at the beginning of the H1N1 outbreak (Johnson 2009, 6) .
