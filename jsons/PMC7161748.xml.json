            "text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major etiological agent responsible for the outbreaks of hand\u2010foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease (HFMD) in such Asian countries as China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. EV71 infection of children under 5 years of age may result in severe neurological complications and even death, and EV71 outbreaks in Taiwan led to 78 deaths in 1998 and 14 deaths in 2008 (for review see (Kung et al., 2014)). The epidemics are even more serious in China, causing 7.2 million cases of HFMD and claiming 2457 lives from 2008 to 2012 (Liang and Wang, 2014). The increasing frequency of EV71 epidemics and fatality rates underscore the urgent need to develop vaccines against EV71. Currently, several forms of EV71 vaccines, such as inactivated whole virus (Cheng et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b), recombinant protein (Zhao et al., 2013), synthetic peptides (Liu et al., 2010) and pseudotyped baculovirus that displays the major immunogen VP1 (Kiener et al., 2013), have been developed. In particular, inactivated whole virus vaccines are the most exhaustively studied and clinical trials of different phases have been completed in China, Taiwan, and Singapore (for review see (Liang and Wang, 2014)). Besides these vaccines, virus\u2010like particle (VLP) is the empty particle composed of viral structural proteins and devoid of viral nucleic acids, and has emerged as a promising vaccine platform (Lin et al., 2014b; Lua et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014).",

            "text": "EV71 has a non\u2010enveloped, icosahedral capsid comprised of VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4 (Plevka et al., 2012). During EV71 replication, the viral structural polyprotein P1 is first cleaved by 3CD protease into VP0, VP1, and VP3. Catalyzed by the encapsidation of viral RNA genome, VP0 is further processed into VP2 and VP4, resulting in the formation of mature virus (Lyu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012). In addition, EV71 infection of susceptible mammalian cells results in the production of empty particles consisting of only VP0, VP1, and VP3 while lacking the RNA (Liu et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012). Inspired by the natural EV71 virus assembly process, we have co\u2010expressed recombinant P1 and 3CD using the baculovirus expression system, which resulted in the cleavage of P1 by 3CD into VP0, VP1, and VP3 and assembly into VLP in the Sf\u20109 insect cells (Hu et al., 2003). Subsequently, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus, Bac\u2010P1\u20103CD, that encoded P1 under the polyhedrin (polh) promoter and 3CD under the p10 promoter (Chung et al., 2006). Infection of Sf\u20109 cells with Bac\u2010P1\u20103CD successfully led to the P1 and 3CD co\u2010expression and VLP production. After purification, the EV71 VLP was fairly stable (Lin et al., 2014a) and capable of inducing protective humoral immune responses in mice (Chung et al., 2010; Chung et al., 2008; Li et al., 2013) and monkeys (Lin et al., 2012). Importantly, the VLP was able to trigger potent cellular immune responses and confer protection against viral challenge in mice (Chung et al., 2008), thanks to the activation of dendritic cells through toll\u2010like receptor 4 signaling (Lin et al., 2014c).",

To enhance the VLP yield, we constructed Bac\u2010P1\u2010C3CD which expressed P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV) promoter. Bac\u2010P1\u2010C3CD infection of Sf\u20109 cells elevated the VLP yield to \u224840\u201365 mg/L under optimized culture/infection conditions (Chung et al., 2010). However, excessive VLP degradation was observed during the production. Therefore, here we employed an alternative baculovirus vector system, in conjunction with appropriate baculovirus expression cassette design and cell selection, in attempts to improve the VLP yield and minimize the degradation. The VLP production yield, kinetics, and degradation using different baculovirus vectors were monitored. Whether the resultant VLP was able to trigger cross\u2010reactive immune responses and confer protection against lethal virus challenge was examined.",

However, the VLP yield using conventional baculovirus vectors is usually limited and represents a roadblock to commercial applications. For instance, the yield of chikungunya virus and infectious bursal disease virus VLP falls in the range of 20\u201330 mg/L (Hu and Bentley, 1999; Wagner et al., 2014) while the VLP yield of Ebola virus is 5\u201310 mg/L (Ye et al., 2006). Besides, the VLP yield of H1N1 influenza virus, HIV, human papillomavirus type 33, porcine parvovirus and SARS\u2013CoV is generally far lower than 10 mg/L (Baek et al., 2011; Krammer et al., 2010a; Maranga et al., 2002; Mortola and Roy, 2004; Senger et al., 2009).",

Although the second generation recombinant baculovirus Bac\u2010P1\u2010C3CD was able to enhance the VLP yield (Chung et al., 2010), the VLP proteins appeared to be unstable during the production phase. To enhance the VLP yield by boosting the P1 expression, we designed a panel of baculoviral constructs which co\u2010expressed P1 and 3CD, yet with an hr1 enhancer or an HS4 insulator appended to the 3\u2032 end of P1 gene (Fig. S1), which were reported to enhance the recombinant protein yield (Viswanathan et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2009). However, infection of High Five\u2122 cells with these constructs failed to increase the VLP yield when compared with Bac\u2010P1\u20103CD (Fig. S1). To reduce the 3CD expression by attenuating the p10 promoter strength, we employed truncated p10 promoters to drive the 3CD expression and used polh promoter to drive the P1 expression. However, the resultant baculovirus vectors still gave inferior VLP yield (Fig. S2). Using the B5 genotype as an example, we also attempted to append a woodchuck hepatitis virus post\u2010transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE, which reportedly enhances the RNA stability and protein production (Mahonen et al., 2007)) to the 3\u2032 end of P1 gene or co\u2010expressed P1 and 3CD in tandem under the polh promoter, with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element in between (Fig. S3). We also constructed a baculovirus that expressed P1\u2010IRES\u20103CD under the polh promoter and expressed an additional P1 under the p10 promoter (Fig. S3). However, none of these baculoviruses improved the VLP yield when compared with the original design (co\u2010expressing P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the p10 promoter).",

Therefore we adopted a different approach and selected the flashBAC GOLDTM system for the construction of recombinant baculoviruses (Fig. 1A). The flashBAC GOLDTM system was distinct from the Bac\u2010to\u2010Bac\u00ae system in that v\u2010cath and chiA genes were deleted from the baculoviral genome. Baculovirus cathepsin encoded by v\u2010cath is a papain\u2010like cysteine protease (Ohkawa et al., 1994) while chitinase encoded by chiA functions in concert with cathepsin and promotes liquefaction of the host in the latter stages of infection, resulting in the release of viruses to infect more cells (Hawtin et al., 1997). Both v\u2010cath and chiA are dispensable for viral replication/polyhedron production in insect cells, thus deletion of v\u2010cath and/or chiA from the baculoviral genome hampers the liquefaction of hosts to some extent. Consequently, infection of insect cells with the recombinant baculovirus deficient in v\u2010cath and chiA genes ameliorates the integrity of both intracellular and secreted recombinant proteins (Kaba et al., 2004) as well as elevates the expression yield of secreted and membrane\u2010targeted proteins (Hitchman et al., 2010b).",

This approach was justified by the finding that inhibition/deletion of p10 promoter enhances the polh\u2010controlled protein production (Vlak et al., 1988). The importance of replacing p10 promoter was further evidenced by our supplementary data which unveiled that 3CD expression driven by the full\u2010length or truncated p10 promoter gave rise to inferior VLP yield, either using the Bac\u2010to\u2010Bac\u00ae (Fig. S1) or flashBAC GOLDTM (Fig. S4) baculovirus system.

Cathepsin encoded by v\u2010cath is a cysteine protease synthesized late in infection as an inactive pro\u2010enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is activated by proteolytic cleavage upon cell death (Hitchman et al., 2011). Cysteine protease activity is the most abundant protease activity in the medium of virus\u2010infected Sf9 cells (Gotoh et al., 2001), which led to significant VLP degradation in the Bac\u2010P1\u2010C3CD\u2010infected cell culture (Figs. 2B\u20132C). Since the flashBAC GOLDTM\u2010based BacF\u2010P1\u2010C3CD was deficient in v\u2010cath and chiA, the VLP degradation was minimal in the BacF\u2010P1\u2010C3CD\u2010infected cell lysate (Figs. 2B\u20102C). Such reduction of proteolysis was also observed in Sf9 cells infected with a v\u2010cath\n\u2010/chiA\n\u2010 baculovirus (for review see (Hitchman et al., 2011)). Furthermore, chitinase is targeted to the ER and may act as a chaperone for the correct folding of pro\u2010v\u2010cath in the ER (Hom and Volkman, 2000). Expression of chiA could not only activate the cathepsin function but also obstruct the ER, severely compromising the function and efficacy of the secretory pathway (Possee et al., 1999). Altogether, deletion of v\u2010cath and chiA could attenuate the VLP degradation and deterioration of cellular functions after baculovirus infection, thus facilitating the VLP protein production and assembly.",

The MultiBac system remarkably improves the recombinant protein quality, reduces proteolytic breakdown (Berger et al., 2004) and has been exploited for enhancing the yield of HPV VLP (Senger et al., 2009). Furthermore, a baculovirus vector (flashBAC ULTRATM, Oxford Expression Technologies) with 5 non\u2010essential genes (v\u2010cath, chiA, p10, p26, and p74) removed from the virus genome was developed, which was shown to further enhance the yield of recombinant proteins when compared with flashBAC GOLDTM deficient in only v\u2010vath/chiA (Hitchman et al., 2010a). More recently, a new flashBAC PRIMETM system (Oxford Expression Technologies) was developed, which claimed to increase the yield of VLP by inducing cell lysis at a very late stage of infection in Trichoplusia ni\u2010derived cell lines (http://oetltd.com/products/product/flashBAC_PRIME/).

The chromatography process we used allowed for the recovery of \u224836% purified VLP (Lin et al., 2015). The purified VLP was similar to the EV71 empty particle in size, shape and composition (Fig. 3). As a result, immunization of mice with 5 \u03bcg VLP was sufficient to induce humoral immune responses that were as potent as those induced by same amount of inactivated EV71 virus (Figs. 4A\u20134B). Importantly, 5 \u03bcg purified EV71 VLP per dose induced immune responses capable of neutralizing homologous and heterologous EV71 strains (Fig. 4C) and conferred protection against lethal virus challenge (Fig. 5). Given the significantly improved extracellular VLP yield (\u2248171 mg/L), the recovery efficiency (\u224836%) of extracellular VLP (Lin et al., 2015), and the potent immunogenicity/protection conferred by 5 \u03bcg VLP, one liter High FiveTM culture was able to provide \u224860 mg purified VLP, which was equivalent to \u224812,000 doses of vaccine.
