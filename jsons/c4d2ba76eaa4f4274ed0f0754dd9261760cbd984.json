Assessment of critically ill patients before and during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is crucial in predicting weaning failure. We explored the trend of changes with integrated lung and cardiac ultrasonography in predicting success of weaning in neurosurgical patients. Lung ultrasound and cardiac ultrasound was performed before and after 30 min and 120 min of SBT. Lung ultrasound score (LUS, range 0-36) was calculated using a predefined method of assessment of six chest regions on either side. The left ventricular function was evaluated by measuring fractional area change. The maximum velocities of mitral inflow E and A waves (E/A), deceleration time of E wave (DTE) and tissue doppler based E\u2032 wave at lateral annulus to calculate E/E\u2032, were measured to assess left ventricular filling pressure. Twenty seven patients underwent SBT, among these 22 had success and five had failure of SBT. The SBT failure group had higher baseline LUS and progressively higher LUS during SBT compared to the success group, suggesting significant lung de-recruitment. There was significant increase in the LV filling pressure (increase E/A and E/E\u2032, decrease in DTE) after 30 and 120 min of SBT in failure group compared to the success group. Point of care lung and cardiac ultrasonography may be useful in detecting cardiopulmonary changes induced by SBT. Higher lung aeration loss and LV filling pressure were observed with SBT failure group.",

            "text": "Prediction of weaning failure, particularly in neurosurgical patients is challenging. Delayed weaning and extubation in acute brain injured patients increases the rate of mortality and prolongs length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) [1] . Similarly, early attempts of weaning are complicated by post-extubation respiratory dysfunction and reintubation, associated with increased mortality, higher rate of tracheostomy, increased duration of ventilatory support and prolonged length of ICU stay [2, 3] . The common reasons for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in neurosurgical patients include impaired neurological function, airway protection or raised intracranial pressure, in addition to cardiorespiratory abnormalities. The primary aim of care for these patients is to detect and prevent any secondary neurological insult while supporting systemic and neurological homeostasis. Hypoxia and hypercarbia are factors which need to be absolutely avoided while caring for such patients. Mechanical ventilation is continued until the patient is clinically stabilized and primary neurological damage has been taken care. Subsequently the transition from control ventilation to spontaneous ventilation begins [4, 5] .",

These data also suggest that complete neurological recovery is not necessary to execute successful extubation [6, 7] . The aetiology for weaning failure from ventilatory support is usually multifactorial, involving composite interaction between cardiac and lung function. In ICU, utility of numerous respiratory indices to guide weaning process have been replaced by spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) [8, 9] . Apart from loss of lung aeration due to transition from prolonged mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing, there is increase LV preload and after load, and decrease in LV compliance. These factors may increase LV filling pressure leading to failure of weaning [10, 11] .",

We present trend of changes in lung ultrasound findings and echocardiographic cardiac status during SBT. Brisk dynamic changes in the pulmonary and cardiac load taking place throughout the SBT can be picked up by cardiopulmonary sonography in real time. In our study SBT failure group had higher basal LUS (p = 0.007, Table 2 ) and progressively increasing LUS at 30 min and at end of SBT denoting significant lung de-recruitment (Fig. 1) . There was no difference in the LV filling pressure before SBT between success and failure groups ( Table 2) , but there was significant increase in the LV filling pressure (increase E/A and E/E\u2032, decrease in DTE) after 30 and 120 min of SBT in failure group compared to the success group (Table 2, Fig. 2 ). In our trial none of the patients had LV systolic dysfunction before or at the Fig. 2 ). Increase in LUS leading to significant de-recruitment and increase in LV filling pressure may have cumulatively contributed to failure of SBT. It is difficult to differentiate incidence of cardiac or pulmonary related weaning failure, because the increase in cardiac and pulmonary load are strongly interconnected [24] . In a study by Soummer [13] , Fig. 1 Depicting trend of change of LUS and hemodynamic variables over SBT time points. SBT spontaneous breathing trial, LUS lung ultrasound score, SBP systolic blood pressure, DBP diastolic blood pressure, HR heart rate patients with lower LUS had better aeration and patients with progressive higher LUS during SBT had progressive lung de-recruitment. Initiation of weaning in our study was based on a clinical decision of treating intensivist, assuming that the respiratory condition has been optimally stabilised. However, without objective evidence, the process of weaning may be initiated far before normalization of pulmonary function. SBT failure or extubation failure is likely due to FAC fractional area change, SBT spontaneous breathing trial, E doppler mitral early diastolic wave, A doppler mitral late diastolic wave, DTE deceleration time of E wave, E\u2032 tissue doppler based early diastolic wave at lateral annulus inadequate lung reaeration at the time of SBT. Lung ultrasonography provides a reliable method to estimate regional aeration of lung [19, 20] . Literature suggests transition from mechanical ventilation to spontaneous breathing is linked with increased cardiac preload and after load [14, 25] . Similar to our study results, literature suggests there are significant changes in doppler mitral flow indexes (increase in E/A, E/E\u2032 and decrease in DTE) following initiation of SBT, suggesting increase in left ventricular filling pressure [14, 26] . Integrative use of cardiothoracic chest ultrasound data may help in predicting SBT failure or post extubation distress in critically ill patients [27, 28] .",

Reasons for reintubation included neurological deterioration (n = 2) and inability of the patient to manage excessive secretions after extubation (n = 2). Currently, indices intended to predict SBT failure are indirect evidence of loss of lung aeration such as oxygen saturation defect, tachypnoea to compensate minute ventilation, altered mental status, tachycardia and hemodynamic instability [24] . Direct assessment of regional lung aeration provides a major advantage in predicting SBT success. Lung ultrasound has replaced conventional radiological means of assessing lung aeration, because it is point of care, easily repeatable, non-invasive and highly predictable [20, 32] . Several trials have shown utility of lung ultrasound for lung re-aeration following antimicrobial therapy in ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) [33] , assessing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prone position induced lung recruitment [20] and resolution of pulmonary oedema [34] . Lung ultrasound based detection of SBT induced de-recruitment may not elicit the cause for aeration loss. The other probable factors involved in SBT induced lung aeration loss like fluid overload, massive pleural effusion, pulmonary infection, cardiac dysfunction, copious bronchial secretions and diaphragmatic dysfunction should be screened simultaneously and managed accordingly.",

Before generalising the results of this study, a randomized, multicentre interventional study is required to assess the impact of combined cardiothoracic chest ultrasound monitoring during SBT. In this study a single investigator performed ultrasound examination who had 12 months experience in lung cardiac ultrasound. Trials have shown the learning curve for gaining skills in chest ultrasonography ranges from 3 weeks to 7 months based on the expertise level [35] [36] [37] . In SBT failure group, we were unable to differentiate the major contributor-lung aeration loss or increased LV filling pressure or a combined effect. The criteria for failure to tolerate SBT was based on clinical judgement (parameters include change of level of consciousness, clinical features of respiratory distress, and haemodynamic instability). Another objective assessment determining failure of SBT, like arterial blood gas analysis was not used in this study during SBT. We did not evaluate biological markers of cardiovascular system during SBT like circulating B-type and atrial natriuretic peptides (BNP, ANP) to predict weaning success [11] .",
