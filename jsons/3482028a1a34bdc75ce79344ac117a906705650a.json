We show that this size is strongly related to the regularity of \u2202\u2126 by providing bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of \u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126. In particular we show that, if \u2202\u2126 has C 1,\u03b1 regularity then H d\u22122+\u03b1 (\u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126) > 0. This shows that a sufficient condition to ensure that H d\u22121 (\u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126) > 0 is that \u2202\u2126 has C 1,1 regularity. Since the Hausdorff bounds can be inferred in dependence of the regularity of \u2202E as well, we obtain that \u2126 convex, which yields \u2202E \u2208 C 1,1 , is also a sufficient condition. Finally, we construct examples showing that such bounds are optimal in dimension d = 2.",

Lately this problem acquired an interest on its own and the literature produced concerning it is extremely rich, (some contributions can be found at [4] , [5] , [6] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [28] , [29] , [38] ). We also refer to [27] , [32] : two exhaustive surveys on the Cheeger problem in R d . The constant h(\u2126) is called the Cheeger constant of \u2126 and a set E \u2282 \u2126 attaining P (E) /L d (E) = h(\u2126) is called a Cheeger set of \u2126. The constant h(\u2126) can be interpreted also as the first eigen-value of the p-Laplacian for p = 1, and it can be used to give an upper bound to the diameter of riemannian manifolds bearing nonnegative Ricci curvature (see for instance [26] , [12] ). Existence of Cheeger sets can be attained by direct methods of Calculus of Variations as well as established regularity techniques give further properties of a Cheeger set E in dependence of the regularity of the ambient space \u2126 (we refer to Theorem 2.5 where the main properties are collected). For instance a strong regularity property of the free boundary \u2202E \u2229 \u2126 can be inferred: it is an analytic hyper-surface with constant mean curvature up to a set \u03a3 of dimension at most d \u2212 8. However, an analysis that seems to be missing in literature concerns the size of what we call contact surface of the Cheeger set, consisting of the points where the two boundaries meet \u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126. Given enough Figure 1 . An ambient space \u2126 with a representation of one of its Cheeger sets. Provided \u2126 has boundary regularity of class C 1,1 we can ensure H d\u22121 (\u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126) > 0. However there can be part of \u2126 in which, locally, the contact set has smaller dimension than (d \u2212 1).

We underline that the nature of the problem would suggest that any Cheeger sets will try to be as big as it can (since the ratio P (rE) /L d (rE) = P (E) /rL d (E) scales as 1 /r). So intuitively it appears clear that the contact set \u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126 will be not empty. This intuitive argument however can be pushed up to deduce that H 0 (\u2202E \u2229\u2202\u2126) \u2265 2 as underlined by Remark 2.4 (denoting by H s the s-dimensional measure and for s = 0 the counting measure) but not more. Indeed, for example in presence of high singularities of \u2202\u2126, such as cusps or angles, the Cheeger set may find convenient to avoid it and prefer a gain in the minimality of the perimeter to a gain in volume, making so unclear what kind of size for \u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126 one should expect. The aim of this work is precisely to fill this lack of knowledge. The answer we are able to provide is extremely precise and it links the regularity of \u2202\u2126 to the Hausdorff dimension of such a set. In particular we are able to prove the following facts, stated detailedly inTheorems 3.1, 3.2, and briefly introduced here.",

Indeed locally there can be parts of \u2202\u2126 having a local contact surface, with one of its Cheeger sets, of smaller size than the one claimed. Consider for instance the situation in Figure 1 in which we start from a nice bounded set \u2126, where H 1 (\u2202\u2126 \u2229 \u2202E) > 0, and we deform locally the part \u2202\u2126 \\ \u2202E so to obtain some\u03a9 \u2282 \u2126 such that \u2202\u03a9 touches \u2202E. Since by moving inward the set \u2126 until it touches \u2202E we do not change its Cheeger constant (and thus neither its Cheeger sets), this construction can easily produce a set of contact points which can have a behavior (locally) as wild as we want.

Let us briefly mention the key steps of the argument. We start with an open set \u2126 with C 1,\u03b1 boundary and we assume by contradiction that H d\u22122+\u03b1 (\u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126) = 0. We know, from general facts about Cheeger sets, that the inner free boundary \u2202E \u2229 \u2126 is an analytic hyper-surface with constant mean curvature equal to h(\u2126), up to a singular set \u03a3 of Hausdorff dimension at most d \u2212 8. Now the idea is to extend this property to the whole \u2202E. If we could do that by exploiting the quantitative smallness assumption on \u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126, we would be left with a set of finite perimeter and with constant mean curvature, yielding that E must be a ball due to Alexandrov's Theorem [1] . We actually make use of a revisited version of Alexandrov's Theorem, recently proved in [20] and holding for stationary points of the perimeter functional. Now two possibilities are left: either \u2126 itself was a ball from the very beginning or not. But if \u2126 was a ball then it is well-known that H d\u22121 (\u2202\u2126 \u2229 \u2202E) > 0 and this contradicts our assumption H d\u22122+\u03b1 (\u2202E \u2229\u2202\u2126) = 0. Thus \u2126 cannot be a ball and now the contradiction comes from the fact that E would be a ball and a Cheeger set of something which is not a ball. In particular, this contradictions lead us to say that our initial claim H d\u22122+\u03b1 (\u2202E \u2229\u2202\u2126) = 0 was false: somewhere it must hold H d\u22122+\u03b1 (\u2202E \u2229\u2202\u2126\u2229A) > 0.",

In order to complete the extension of the constant mean curvature property on \u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126 by means of these tools, under the assumption H d\u22122+\u03b1 (\u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126) = 0, we need just to ensure that \u2202E can be locally represented as the graph of a C 1,\u03b1 function. This is done in Lemma 5.1 in the spirit of [23] by observing that the differential inequality behind the Cheeger problem (Subsection 2.5) allows us to import regularity techniques deeply employed in treating obstacle problems. In particular we obtain that, if \u2202\u2126 itself has C 1,\u03b1 boundary then \u2202E has C 1,\u03b1 boundary in a neighbourhood of contact points x \u2208 \u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126. Notice that for \u03b1 = 0 this fact was already observed in [31] in a very general context and for \u03b1 = 1 in [11] . Up to the best of our knowledge the case \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) for Cheeger sets has not been fully developed in literature. However, it was already observed in several treatments of the obstacle problem, mainly for the Dirichlet energy (see for instance [7] ), that the solutions to obstacle problems share the same regularity of the obstacle up to C 1,1 . It is also a commonly observed fact that the regularity obtained in the case of the Dirichlet energy can be transferred to the case of the area functional. Nevertheless it seems that, concerning the Cheeger problem, this argument was never clarified in literature and for the sake of completeness we thus prove it here, starting from a result of [23] through a path involving variational inequalities.",

            "text": "Let us spend also few words on the examples built to prove the sharpness of the bounds in the C 1,\u03b1 case provided in Section 6. The ingredient required to prove Theorem 3.2 relies on particular solutions of the constant mean curvature equation in dimension one (see Figure 2 and 7). These solutions have the property of solving the ODE everywhere but on a closed set \u03b3 which will have the prescribed Hausdorff dimension \u03b1. We then suitably sew together these solutions to obtain a set E which is self-Cheeger and that has constant mean curvature equal to H up to a set \u0393 of Hausdorff dimension \u03b1. A suitable family {\u2126 \u03b4 } \u03b4>0 of ambient space \u2126 is then built around E in a way that \u2202\u2126 \u03b4 \u2229 \u2202E = \u0393. The self-Cheeger property and the construction of E, ensures now that, for some \u03b4 > 0 there exists an \u2126 \u03b4 that has E as one of its Cheeger sets. As it can be seen we are able to produce examples certifying the sharpness of the dimensional bounds on \u2202E \u2229 \u2202\u2126 only in dimension d = 2. Notice that, also for d \u2265 3, solutions to the constant mean curvature equation that fails on sets of prescribed Hausdorff dimension appear to exists but the fact that they also have the geometrical properties required to be sewed together, as it can be shown in d = 2, is actually not clear. What appears also to lack are the instruments concerning the self-Cheeger sets (Theorems 6.1,6.3) required to ensures that the profile obtained is self-Cheeger and it remains a Cheeger set of a small perturbation of the ambient space. We believe however, due to the existence of solutions of the constant mean curvature equation failing on sets with prescribed Hausdorff dimension= d \u2212 2 + \u03b1, that similar examples can be provided in generic dimension, thus yielding the sharpness of the bounds provided here also for d \u2265 3. We remark also that the ingredient required to produce the example in the Lipschitz case do exploit only the geometrical properties of self-Cheeger sets provided in dimension d = 2 by Theorems 6.1, 6.3 and thus, provided similar instruments are available also in d \u2265 3 it is reasonable to suspect that also for the Lipschitz case the examples can be built in general ambient space dimension. Given to the jump of the dimension of the contact surface, from dim H = 0 in the Lipschitz case to dim H \u2265 d \u2212 2 in the C 1 case, it is also reasonable to suspect that, a Lipschitz example for all possible dimensional values between [0, d \u2212 2] of a contact surface can be reached with an explicit construction. We formally state these assertions in the following conjecture. Finally let us note that the approach producing the Hausdorff bounds for contact surface of Cheeger set (and in particular the tools for the removal of the set \u0393 in Section 4 combined with Theorem 2.4) gives also some information on the structure of the boundary of C 1,\u03b1 sets with almost-constant mean curvature (See for instance Remark 5.1).
