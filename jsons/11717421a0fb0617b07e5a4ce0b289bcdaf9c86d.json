We notice that all coefficients had the expected positive sign as well as their credible intervals excluding zero, indicating the presence of a short-term dependence for model 1 and both a short-term dependence and a long-term trend for model 2. A testing of the models' performance is also shown in Table 1 Model 2 has been tested in terms of its predictive ability where the resulting predicted mean occurrences (orange line) have been plotted along with the actual occurrences (blue line) in Figure   1 . As can be seen from the plot, the Poisson autoregressive model as a function of both a shortterm dependence and a long-term dependence predicts the data quite well. With aim of better interpreting the short-term time series and long-term time series of model 2, we notice from Table   1 that the estimated \u03b3 parameter is lower than \u03b2, confirming that a downward trend data is accumulated. Additionally, we splitted the Lebanese data into two-time periods and we repeatedly fitted the model for each data set. More specifically, we first fitted the model on the data, which covers the period from February 23 to March 20, 2020 and the analysis revealed that \u03b3 was larger than \u03b2, confirming the presence of an upward trend (the \u03b3 component) which absorbs the shortterm component.

The models fitted included Poisson autoregressive as a function of a short-term dependence only and Poisson autoregressive as a function of both a short-term dependence and a long-term dependence. The two models are compared in terms of their predictive ability using root mean squared error and deviance information criterion. The Poisson autoregressive model that allows to capture both short and long term memory effects performs best under all criterions. The use of such a model can greatly improve the estimation of number of new infections, and can indicate whether disease has an upward/downward trend, and",
