            "text": "Asia is the largest continent in the world with an estimated population approaching 4 billion, of which children under the age of 19 years constitute more than 1 billion. Unfortunately, health care delivery across the Asian continent is very heterogeneous. The more urgent issues in child health in many Asian countries encompass the control of infections, malnutrition and diarrheal diseases. However, with improvements in public health especially in urban communities, the pattern of childhood disorders has changed in many countries, resulting in a shift in the causes of mortality from infections to other chronic diseases. Therefore, although the major challenges in pediatric nephrology practice still include the management of children with acute kidney injury due to severe dehydration, sepsis and toxins, the prevention and treatment of children with chronic kidney disease is emerging as the new challenge for this millennium. The first Working Group for Pediatric Nephrology in Asia was formed in 1986, holding its first scientific meeting in Tokyo, Japan in 1988. The Asian Society of Pediatric Nephrology (AsPNA) was officially inaugurated in 1996 with a mandate to promote the development of pediatric nephrology in Asia and foster regional cooperation amongst member countries. With regional education and training as one of the main focus, quality care including both acute and chronic renal replacement therapies, as well as strategies for the prevention of chronic kidney disease, will be available more widely to the pediatric population in Asia. Data on childhood end-stage renal disease in Asia is scarce. A survey on renal replacement therapy in 12 Asian countries by Chiu MC et al in 2005 revealed that peritoneal dialysis was the major modality of dialysis in many Asian countries, with chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis being the main modality (64%), followed by automated peritoneal dialysis (30%), and intermittent peritoneal dialysis (6%). Although some countries have specialized hemodialysis facilites for children, however, in many Asian countries, children and adolescents are dialyzed in adult hemodialysis centers. In Asia, the majority of pediatric renal transplants are live-donor related. Patient and graft survival rates at 5 years reported in the 2005 survey were approximately 92% and 81% respectively. On the whole, renal replacement therapy is expensive in many parts of Asia, therefore financial issues limit the availability of end-stage care, especially in the developing countries. In conclusion, the challenge of this millennium for pediatric nephrology in Asia is to address this great divide in health care for children. The main focus should be on training and education, focusing on identification of children at high risk of chronic kidney disease and providing early treatment to prevent progression and the need for renal replacement therapy. At the same time, reduction of morbidity and mortality in children with acute kidney injury can be achieved using evidence-based practice which should be made easily accessible to doctors even in remote regions of the continent. Bone histomorphometry has been has been the gold standard in the evaluation and diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy (RO). The recent new definition of RO as Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder has once again highlighted the use of bone biopsy as a powerful and diagnostic tool to determine skeletal abnormalities in chronic kidney disease. In addition, it has been recommend the inclusion of turnover (T), mineralization (M) and volume (V) in the assessment of bone histology. Thus, we apply the TMV classification in bone biopsies (BBx) obtained after double tetracycline labeling from 140 pts. aged 14\u00b11.2 years on CCPD for 13\u00b13 mos. All pts. were treated with Ca-based binders and daily oral calcitriol that was held for 4 weeks prior to BBx. S-PTH (1st Nichols, 1st generation), S-Alk p'tase, Ca, and P levels were determined at BBx. Twenty five percent of the patients had both normal T and M; 36% high T and M defect; 23% high T and 16% M defect alone. Sensitivity and specifity of PTH levels <400 pg/ml and alk p'tase levels <400 IU/L gave us a sensitivity of 80 and specivity of 77% for predicting patients with both normal T and M. PTH levels \u2265600 pg/ml had a sensitivity of 78% and a specifity of 73 for predicting patients with high T and M defect. Current biochemical markers seemed to unhelpful in distinguishing patients with M defect alone and a bone biopsy is required for its evaluation. FGF-23 is associated with altered skeletal mineralization in individuals with normal renal function; its potential as a biomarker for mineralization in patients with chronic kidney disease remains to be defined. We demonstrated that bone formation rates correlated with PTH (r=0.44, p<0.01), but not with FGF-23. Higher FGF-23 concentrations were associated with improved osteoid thickness and osteoid maturation time. We conclude that FGF-23 may be a new biomarker for the non-invasive assessment of skeletal mineralization in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.",

            "text": "Calcium-containing phosphate binding agents and active vitamin D sterols have been widely recommended for the control of hyperphosphatemia and the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The administration of such compounds, however, contributes to the development of frequent episodes of hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, adynamic osteodystrophy and vascular calcifications. On the other hand, untreated secondary hyperparathyroidism causes significant morbidity, including severe bone deformities, fractures and growth retardation in children. The availability of effective calciumfree-metal free phosphate binding agents, such as sevelamer combined with new active vitamin D sterols, such as doxercalciferol has widened the margin of safety for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although these agents can effectively control serum phosphorus and lower PTH levels, little is known about their effects on the skeletal lesions of secondary hyperparathyroidism. We have therefore prospectively compare the effects of calcium carbonate and sevelamer on the control of the biochemical and skeletal indices of secondary hyperparathyroidism during therapy with either calcitriol or doxercalciferol in pediatric patients treated with peritoneal dialysis. The data demonstrated that sevelamer allows for the use of higher doses of active vitamin D sterols without inducing changes in serum calcium levels and with adequate control of the skeletal lesions of secondary hyperparathyroidism, but the mineralization defect persists. Serum PTH levels between 400-600 pg/ml are associated with indices of bone formation within the normal range in the vast majority of patients after treatment with intermittent doses of active vitamin D sterols.",

Glomerular endothelial dysfunction induces hemodynamic maladjustment at the efferent arteriole, a progressive reduction in peritubular capillary flow, a chronic ischemic injury to the tubulointerstitium, and eventually tublointerstitial fibrosis. Therefore, correction of hemodynamic maladjustment with multidrug vasodilators (ACEI, AII receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, antiplatelet) would be the appropriate therapeutic target.",

Taken together, such alterations encompass in a default angiogenesis and renal microvascular rarefaction. In contrast, a normal or slightly impaired vascular homeostasis is encountered in early stage of CKD associated with favourable environment for renal regeneration. Thus, correction of hemodynamic maladjustment with multidrug vasodilators in the early stage of CKD can enhance peritubular capillary flow, improve renal perfusion to the tubulointerstitium, and effectively prevent the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. This coincides with the improved glomerular filtration rate and hence, prevents the ESRD.",

Maintenance of glomerular capillary would help maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR), whereas maintaining peritubular capillaries in the interstitium would be essential for providing oxygen and nutrition to the tubules and interstitial cells. Afferent and efferent arterioles also play a key role in determination of renal hemodynamics, activation of renin-angiotensin system and intra-glomerular pressure. Recent studies demonstrate a substantial repair capacity of renal microvasculature in various spectrum of renal diseases, however this recovery process of the kidney is compromised in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although an early proliferative response of the glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelium was noted with a loss of functioning nephron mass, the proliferation was not sustained with a progressive loss of the endothelium due to unchecked apoptosis over time. The loss of the glomerular endothelium predisposes to activation of platelets and the coagulation system that favors capillary collapse and the development of glomerulosclerosis. The degree of glomerular and peritubular capillary loss in CKD correlates with the severity of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. These changes in renal microvasculature were preceded by an altered expression of vascular survival factor and/or anti-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombosponsin-1. Interestingly, macrophage-dervied cytokine and vasoactive mediators II was known to play a role in regulation of the expression of angiogenesis-modulating factor in the kidney.",

Basic anthropometric measurements should be taken at every clinic visit, regular clinic assessment combined with dietary assessment via diaries or dietary recall in clinic. The nutritional prescription should be based upon growth, biochemical and haematological data as well as consideration of relevant medications such as phosphate binders, iron and micronutrient supplements and salt balance. Each child has individualised nutritional requirements which should be given by the oral route whenever possible. Inadequate intakes to maintain adequate growth velocity require the early introduction of enteral feeding via the gastrostomy or nasogastric route. Intensive nutritional support requires dietetic and medical time and needs to take into account the psychosocial needs of the family. This may all help to promote normal growth without the need for the routine use of recombinant human growth hormone.",

The IPPR created an online database to record information on the etiology and treatment of peritonitis in 47 centers from 14 countries. Global variation was noted in the 501 peritonitis cases identified in terms of causative organisms, frequency of staphylococcal methicillin resistance, incidence of culture-negative peritonitis and in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Gram-negative peritonitis was associated with the poorest outcome and was most often seen in patients < 5 years old and in those conducting frequent exit-site care with mupirocin. Invitro antibiotic susceptibility data revealed only 69% of gram positive organisms and 80% of gram negative organisms to be susceptible to a first generation cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside, respectively, prompting consideration for alternative recommendations regarding empiric antibiotic therapy. In 89% of cases, there was full functional recovery with less frequent complete resolution occurring among the 52 patients who experienced a relapsing infection. The IPPN has expanded the goals of the registry to monitor overall PD performance and complications and to assess the association between PD practice and outcome. To date, nearly 600 patients have been enrolled in the Network from 76 centers in 27 countries. Preliminary data has revealed global differences in the distribution of PD modality selection, the frequency of growth retardation and growth hormone usage and in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Current analyses are being conducted to assess the correlation between PET transport capacity, dialysis prescription and cardiovascular disease, in addition to the reasons for hospitalization. Continued data collection and analysis should help define global standards for pediatric PD care.",

Several genetic mediators including renin angiotensin system (RAS), VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 have been implicated in initiating and regulating parenchymal damage leading to renal scarring. This study was designed to investigate whether the genetic polymorphisms of RAS, VEGF and TGF-\u03b21, were associated with the susceptibility to UTI, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and subsequent renal scarring. RAS There was no difference in the distribution of the ACE II, ID and DD genotype and the AT1 A1166C transition between the patients with primary VUR and the controls. However, the incidence of AT2 A-1332G transition was significantly lower in primary VUR patients (p=0.047). Furthermore, in the case of combination of ACE and AT2 gene, a significantly lower incidence of primary VUR was seen with II genotype of ACE and A-1332G transition in the AT2 receptor gene(p=0.003).

Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) represents a common and devastating problem in clinical medicine. The lack of early biomarkers for AKI has lead to a delay in initiating potentially effective therapies. The objective of this presentation is to review the status of novel urinary biomarkers for AKI that have progressed to the clinical phase of the biomarker discovery process. Methods: Literature review (PubMed, MedLine) from 2000 to the present. Results: The most promising AKI biomarkers include neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). Conclusions: It is likely that the AKI biomarkers will be useful for timing the initial insult and assessing the duration and severity of AKI. Based on the differential expression of the biomarkers, it is also likely that the AKI panels will help distinguish between the various types and etiologies of AKI, and predict clinical outcomes. Studies to validate the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers in clinical samples from large cohorts and from multiple clinical situations are currently in progress, facilitated by the development of commercial tools for the reproducible measurement of these biomarkers across different laboratories. The availability of such personalized and predictive information could revolutionize renal and critical care medicine in the not-too-distant future.",

Despite significant improvements in therapeutics, the mortality and morbidity associated with AKI remain high. The reasons for this include (a) an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and (b) the lack of early markers for AKI, and hence an unacceptable delay in initiating therapy. Fortunately, the application of innovative technologies such as proteomics to human and animal models of AKI has uncovered several novel proteins that are emerging as biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. Methods: Literature review (PubMed, MedLine) from 2000 to the present. Results: Recent advances in proteomics have resulted in the identification of biomarkers in the plasma (NGAL) and urine (NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18) for the investigation of AKI, as well as identification of proteins that inform the pathophysiology of AKI and offer novel therapeutic targets. Conclusions: Proteomic studies will likely yield additional sensitive and specific biomarkers for the investigation of AKI resulting from diverse etiologies. Such tools will be indispensable for the early diagnosis and initiation of timely therapeutic measures. Goals and objectives: Primary FSGS is a leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in both children and adults, with loss of kidney function in 50% of patients over 10-years. The FSGS -CT was organized and implemented by the NIH in response to this poor prognosis, and the need to rigorously test treatment modalities and to delineate the cellular, molecular and genetic basis of this complex disorder. In evaluating the therapeutic interventions for the FSGS-CT, it was noted that no evidence based medicine has designated a specific therapeutic intervention for steroid-resistant FSGS that significantly reduces proteinuria or preserves renal function in a substantially large proportion of patients. However, the following 4 factors were taken into consideration in the ultimate design of this clinical trial:",

Eligibility criteria include: 1) an estimated GFR > 40 ml/min/1.73m2, 2) a first morning urine protein/creatinine ratio (Up/c) > 1.0, 3) biopsy-confirmed primary FSGS, 4) corticosteroid resistance as defined as failure to achieve sustained Up/c <1.0 based on a course of steroid treatment for 4 wks and/or a minimum cumulative dose of 56 mg/kg or 1,680 mg of prednisone or its equivalent. Major exclusion criteria include: 1) prior therapy with cyclosporine (CsA), tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or rapamycin, 2) BMI> 97th %tile for age or >40 kg/m2, 3) uncontrolled hypertension. Target sample size is 207 randomized patients to achieve 80% power to detect17.9% absolute difference in remission rate. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to one of two active treatment arms: CsA OR pulse dexamethasone and MMF. The target period for each therapeutic intervention is 12 months. Both study groups are also treated with either Lisinopril or Losartan for 18 months and low dose alternate day steroids for 6 months. The outcome measures have been defined to reflect clinical practice and to allow patients to be withdrawn if no therapeutic effect is evident within six months of randomization. The primary outcome is based on achievement of remission of proteinuria: complete remission (CR) Up/c < 0.2; partial remission (PR) Up/c < 50% of baseline value and < 1.0; or no remission (NR). The pattern of response to both therapeutic interventions will be assessed at 6, 12 and 18 months. Patients who do not achieve a CR or PR after 6 months of therapy in either therapeutic arm are defined as treatment failures for the primary outcome, and exit the study. For patients who achieve a CR or PR at six months, the primary outcome will be assessed again at 12 months. If patients have not maintained at least a PR at 12 months, they are considered a therapeutic failure and exit the study. The main secondary outcome is the persistence of remission following withdrawal of the CsA or MMF/dexamethasone after 12 months on therapy. This secondary outcome will be assessed after 6 months off therapy (i.e., 18 months after enrollment) only for patients who have achieved a CR or PR after 12 months on therapy.",

The mechanisms by which therapeutic agents induce remission in susceptible individuals with NS are not well understood and remain one of the most important questions in nephrology today. We previously demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid inactivating enzyme, 11 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, are expressed in the glomerular podocyte (Kidney Int 1999; J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2002) . Recent compelling evidence indicates that therapeutic agents may exert the antiproteinuric effect by restoring nephrin biogenesis because the loss of nephrin expression and altered cellular localization of nephrin in the podocyte foot processes results in proteinuria. Method: To gain a direct crosstalk between therapeutic agents action and altered nephrin biogenesis, we focused on the role of the intracellular energy homeostasis in maintaining nephrin trafficking machinery. To inhibit nephrin biogenesis, we established a model of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) induced by glucose starvation in nephrin expressing cell line. Result and Discussion: Glucose starvation induced hypoglycosylated nephrin which retained in the ER, not be transported to the plasma membrane. Interestingly glucocorticoid partially rescued plasma membrane localization of nephrin through recovery of ER chaperone (calreticulin) function via increase of ATP by upregulation of the mitochondrial genes (Kidney Int 2006) . On the other hand, mizoribine, which was discovered in Japan and frequently used for steroid dependent NS, restored the intracellular energy balance by salvaging the ATP levels and completely rescued expression of the mature, fully-glycosylated, plasma membrane nephrin by a mechanism dependent on the inhibition of the Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase activity (J Am Soc Nephrol 2007). We also determined that the energy imbalance alters not only nephrin biogenesis but also other N-glycoprotein 1-integrin biogenesis. These data suggest that immunosuppressants may directly act on the diseased podocyte through interacting with energy system, results in the rescue of pathological proteinuria of NS.",

In Japan, most of the pediatric nephrologists treat children with FRNS with cyclophosphamide, mizoribine or cyclosporine (CyA). And more than half of children with FRNS are treated with CyA. CyA is a relatively new agent that is useful in the management of FRNS. The beneficial effects of CyA, however, often are accompanied by side effects. Of greatest concern is chronic CyA nephropathy, characterized by arteriolar lesions and tubulointerstitial (TI) lesions. Methods: We examined clinical course of chronic CyA nephropathy and risk factors for the development of CyA-induced TI lesions. We conducted a prospective, open-label multi-center randomized controlled trial with trough level monitoring of CyA (Sandimmune) to develop a safe and effective CyA treatment for FRNS. Patients were randomly divided into two groups with both initially receiving CyA for 6 months to maintain a whole-blood trough level between 80 and 100 ng/ml. Over the next 18 months, the dose was adjusted to maintain a slightly lower (60-80 ng/ml) trough level in Group A, while Group B received a fixed dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day. The primary end point was the rate of sustained remission with analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle. Results: The arteriolar lesions were improved by discontinuation of CyA, but the TI lesions did not regress with drug discontinuation (J Am Soc Nephrol 11:2265 -2271 , 2000 , Pediatr Nephrol 16:723-727, 2001 . Thus, prevention of the development of CyA-induced TI lesions is the most important issue in CyA treatment for children with FRNS. Duration of CyA treatment (>24 months) and duration of heavy proteinuria (>30 days) were independent significant risk factors for the development of CyA-induced TI lesions (Kidney Int 61:1801 -1805 , 2002 . After 2 years, the rate of sustained remission was significantly higher in Group A as compared with Group B. Mild arteriolar hyalinosis of the kidney was more frequently seen in Group A than in Group B, but no patient was diagnosed with CyA-induced TI lesions. Conclusions: CyA for 2 years in a dosage that maintains the trough level between 80 and 100 ng/ml for the first 6 months and 60 and 80 ng/ml for the next 18 months is an effective and relatively safe treatment for children with FRNS (Kidney Int 73: 1167 -1173 . I also introduce an on-going prospective multi-center randomized controlled trial with C2 monitoring of CyA (Neoral) (JSKDC 03).",

            "text": "Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan Dent disease is an X-linked renal tubular disorder characterized by low molecular weight (LMW) proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis and progressive renal failure. Patients usually go into end-stage renal failure when they are 49 years old in average. Most of the patients are detected as proteinuria by a school urinalysis screening in Japan. About 60% of the Japanese patients with Dent disease are due to the mutations in chloride channel 5 (ClC-5) gene (CLCN5). CLCN5 encodes a 746 amino acid ClC-5 that has about 12 transmembrane domains. Mutational analysis of CLCN5 revealed mutational \"hot spots\" at codons 279, 648, and 704 (nonsense mutations) and at codon 506 (missense mutation) in British and Japanese patients. Three missense mutations (S270R, L278F and R280P) on the putative loop between domains 5 and 6 of ClC-5 protein suggest that this putative loop may have a regulatory role in ClC-5 function. ClC-5 protein is expressed in the proximal tubule, thick ascending limb of Henle, and the intercalated cells of the collecting duct. ClC-5 protein is localized to the subapical endosomes with H + -ATPase in the proximal tubule. Acidic endosomal pH formed by ClC-5 and H+-ATPase is necessary for normal endosomal function, including endocytosis, trafficking, and recycling to the surface. Two knocked-out mouse models revealed that megalin's expression was reduced. Moreover, histological analysis of the kidney specimen from the patient revealed reduced expression of megalin on the luminal membrane of the proximal tubules. Urine concentration of megalin is decreased in the patients with Dent disease. These observations suggest defective binding of protein with megalin in the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule and resulted proteinuria. Approximately 10% of patients with Dent disease have OCRL1 (causative gene for Lowe syndrome) mutations. OCRL1 encodes a protein that regulates the function of endosome. Mutations in OCRL1 can occur with isolated renal phenotype of Dent disease in patients lacking cataracts, renal tubular acidosis, and neurological abnormalities that are characteristic of Lowe syndrome. However, the precise pathogenesis is still unknown. This also suggests genetic heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of Dent disease. Unlike the patients with typical Lowe syndrome, none of patients have metabolic acidosis. These observations and findings suggest that OCRL1 mutations can cause the isolated renal phenotype of Dent disease and affected individuals lack the cataracts, typical facial features, renal tubular acidosis, and neurologic abnormalities that are characteristic to Lowe syndrome. It is difficult to explain that OCRL1 mutations can cause the isolated renal phenotype of Dent disease. However, it is possible that another phosphatase, INPP5B, which shares amino acid homology with OCRL1, can compensate phosphatase activity in patients with Dent disease due to OCRL1 mutations.",

Hypercalciuria is dysfunction corrected by thiazide diuretics therapy in doses similar to effective doses for idiopathic hypercalciuria, presumably by stimulating the reabsorption of calcium in the distal convoluted tubule, where ClC-5 channel is not expressed. However, this is not a long-term study which provides the evidence that it is effective to prevent or delay the progression of end stage renal failure. In animal experiment using clcn5 (mouse chloride channel 5 gene) knock-out mice, high citrate diets can delay the progression of nephrocalcinosis and end stage renal failure. Treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker may delay progression of end stage renal failure. The kidney plays a pivotal role in elimination of the toxic compounds, e.g. endogenous metabolites, drugs, environmental compounds, and their metabolites from the body. Elimination of these toxic compounds via kidney is performed not only by glomerular filtration but also tubular secretion. Over the last decade, tremendous knowledge on the role of organic anion transporters in tubular secretion has been clarified. The organic anion transporters include several families; namely, OAT family, OATP family and MRP family. Among these, the members of OAT family play the central in the kidney.",

The registry of the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (formerly the North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study) was initiated in 1987 to capture information about current transplant practice and trends in immunosuppressive therapy with a goal of improving the care of the pediatric renal allograft recipient in North America. Over the past two decades, data has been collected from 10,762 transplants (9,854 index) in recipients <21 years and has revealed substantial changes in patient management and outcome with time. Whereas the percentage of young (<6 years) recipients has remained constant at 20%, the percentage of young (<10 years) deceased donors has decreased from 35% in 1987 to only 7% in 2007. The height SDS at the time of transplant has increased from -2.43 to -1.37 and the mean number of hospitalization days during the first transplant month has decreased by 50%. Substantial changes in induction and maintenance immunosuppressive therapy have been associated with a decreased probability of a first rejection by 12 months for living-donor (54.1% to 13.7%) and deceased-donor (69.3% to 17.9%) recipients. In addition, 1 year graft survival rates have improved from 89.4% and 75.2% for living-donor and deceased-donor recipients, respectively in 1987-1990, to current rates of 95.7% and 95.0%. This improvement has, however, been complicated by a malignancy rate that has increased from 1.05 in 1987-1990 to 2.45 more recently. Nevertheless, 5 year patient survival has significantly improved for all deceased-donor recipients and the 3 year survival of infants receiving living-donor grafts has improved from 89.8% to 95.5%. Ongoing data collection in the transplant registry and the continued development of prospective clinical trials based on the analysis of registry data will likely result in continued improvement in the outcome of pediatric transplant recipients.",

In Thailand SLE is not an uncommon disease. The ratio of pediatric SLE to pediatric out-patients in tertiary care hospitals is 1: 700. The Thai Pediatric Nephrology Association has conducted a multicenter study in 13 tertiary care hospitals all over the country. The objective of the study is to determine the clinical outcomes of Thai children with SLE and risk factors for chronic renal insufficiency.The data of 500 SLE children, age at diagnosis less than 15 years, newly diagnosed during 1 January 2002-31 December 2006 were reviewed. Severity and damage of the disease were assessed using ECLAM index and SLICC/ACR damage index respectively. The ratio of female: male is 5.5: 1. Kidney involvement is found in 82% of the patients. Kidney biopsy is done in 351 patients. The most common pathology found is diffused proliferative lupus nephritis. Prednisolone plus pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide is the standard treatment for these patients. There has been increasing use of mycophenolate mofetil in recent years. Majority of patients achieve favorable outcome. The mean ECLAM index at initial is 6 + 2.7 and decreases significantly after treatment. Chronic renal insufficiency is found in 11 patients while 7 of these patients require renal replacement therapy. Risk factor for developing chronic renal failure is initial GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Concernig complication and damage, the frequently found organ damages are eyes (22.5%), kidney (10.5%), neurologic (8.5%) and musculoskeletal (16%) systems respectively. In this study, 14 patients died and the most common cause of death is infection. Quality of life which is one of the important outcome measures is being studied to determine the quality of life of Thai children with SLE. Introduction: Primary IgA nephropathy is the most common primary renal disease in the world wide. Since it was reported in 1968 by J Berger and N Hinglais, the disease of IgA nephropathy is emphasized more and more in the aspect of incidence, clinical characters, prognosis and treatment. To understand the incidence as well as the clinical features in IgA nephropathy a retrospective study on IgA nephropathy was finished and reported by the Chinese Society of Pediatric Nephrology in 2007, the relevant data was compared with that reported previously by other groups. Method: Totally 1349 cases of IgA nephropathy from 33 hospitals of different cities from January 1995 to December 2004 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. More data on childhood IgA nephropathy from published reports in Chinese along with data from other countries were compared. Result: IgA nephropathy in children under 14 years accounted for 1.37% of the hospitalized cases with urological-kidney diseases, and 11.18% of cases with renal biopsies. The cases of IgA nephropathy increased from 327 (0.83%) to 1022 (1.73%) in the periods of 1995 to 1999 and 2000 to 2004, respectively (P<0.01). Whereas, the previous survey conducted by the Chinese Society of Pediatric Nephrology demonstrated that IgA nephropathy accounted for 7.3% of cases with renal biopsies, and ranked forth in the renal diseases in children.",

Nevertheless the real incidence of IgA nephropathy still need to carry out epidemiology investigation. The global epidemic of obesity is largely responsible for the high prevalence of metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and elevated proinflammatory biomarkers. Metabolic syndrome adversely affects kidney structure and function. Increased body mass index has been shown to be associated with increased risk for developing end-stage renal disease. The mechanism by which obesity leads to renal disease is not fully understood at the present time. This presentation will summarize some human and animal studies conducted in the United States and Asian countries on the subject of obesity and related kidney disease. Obese patients have glomerular hyperfiltration and are at higher risk for developing glomerulopathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Investigations on adipokines, which include leptin, resistin and adiponectin, demonstrate an important role of adipokines in the pathogenesis of obesity-related renal disease. In children with chronic renal disease the level of a cardiovascular protective factor adiponectin is relatively low in overweight patients as compared to lean patients. An inverse correlation between albuminuria and plasma levels of adiponectin has also been shown in non-diabetic adults with obesity. Transgenic mice lacking adiponectin (Ad-/-mice) exhibit an increased urinary albumin excretion and effacement of podocyte foot processes. Treatment of adiponectin to the Ad-/-mice reduces albuminuria and restores podocyte morphology. The effect of adiponectin is largely due to the activation of 5'-AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). Since albuminuria is a strong predictive factor for renal disease progression, adiponectin and its signal transduction pathway may represent a therapeutic target for potential treatment of obesity-related kidney disease. Introduction: The uncontrolled hyperglycemia of maternal diabetes has been found to negatively affect pregnancy, including renal agesis, small kidney, hydronephrosis and fused kidneys. Furthermore, the number of nephrons was significantly reduced in the pups of diabetic female rats. We hypothesized that children of gestational hyperglycemic mothers develop defects of renal development similar to those observed in our animal model. Methods: We observed the defects of renal development of diabetic pregnancy from late phase of embryogenesis to postnatal period in animal model (C57BL/6J mice). We also used 2-(2-D) and 3-(3-D) dimensional power Doppler renal ultrasound (US) to measure and compare the kidney/liver echogenic ratio in 76 children born to gestational hyperglycemic mothers versus 240 age-matched healthy children. The age of 20 babies was < 6 months throughout their follow-up, while 56 children were followed between 6 months and 4 years of age. Whole kidney volume, mean grayness (MG) and vascularization (VI), flow (FI) and vascularization-flow (VFI) indices were calculated. Result: In our preliminary studies, defects and abnormalities of mice fetal kidney development under the environment of maternal hyperglycemia induced by streptozotocin injection were established. Histologically, large glomerular size, reudced nephron number, and ureteric tubular detachment were observed. Cell apoptosis, but not cell proliferation, was significant increased in fetal kidney of diabetic group. In the molecular level, we noticed that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and early growth response alpha (EGF\u03b1) expressions are down-regulated at peri-tubular region of developing fetal kidney of diabetic group. In > 6-month-old children from hyperglycemic mothers during pregnancy, the 2-D US echogenic kidney/liver ratio was higher than in age-matched controls (P<0.01). Furthermore, higher incidence of non-obstructive hydronephrosis was detected in 20 children (26.3%) born to gestational hyperglycemic mothers then no-hyperglycemic mothers (1%). 3-D US demonstrated lower mean renal volume, VI, FI and VFI in children of hyperglyce-mic mother then in children of normoglycemia mothers beyond six months of age. Conclusion: GDNF-dependent activation of GFR\u03b1-1 and Ret in fetal renal tissue is mediated by a complex intracellular signal network. The kidney/liver echogenic ratio on 2-D US and indices of renal volume and vascularization on 3-D power Doppler scan may enable clinicians to establish an early baseline and follow the evolution of these renal characteristics in high-risk children.",

Steroid minimization and avoidance have shown early promise.

            "text": "Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a common kidney problem among hospitalized pediatric patients. Basic pathology is related to leaking of proteins through glomerulus. Abnormality of immunoglubulins occurs because of gloumerular leakage, decrease synthesis and abnormal metabolism. Immunoglobulin is lost in urine along with albumin leading to hypogammaglobulinaemia. Deposition of IgM in the kidney is associated with longtime prognosis. Nephrotic syndromes (NS) with atopic child are associated with raised level of immunoglobulin E. Deceased level with reduced functional capacity of immunoglobulin is responsible for increase prone to infection in already immunocompromised patients with nephrotic syndrome. Low IgA level in patient with NS is associated with respiratory tract infection and diarrhea, and are frequently relapser. Studies showed that significantly reduced level of IgG is found in steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome in compare to steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Persistent low or low normal serum IgG level during period of remission is predictor of frequent relapse in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. So, immunuglobulins play an important role in the pathogenesis, in the management plan, and as a predictor of the outcome of nephrotic syndrome. Introduction: Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a heterogeneous disorder and the most severe and frequent type of all glomerulopathies in children leading to end stage renal failure. The podocyte is at the centre of development and progress of FSGS since this unique cell type plays a major role in the integrity of glomerular structure and permeability. Results: The rate of complete remission of SRNS after induction therapy using different immunosuppressive agents is reported to range between 30-84%, depending on the treatment schedule and on the underlying defects of FSGS. Children with genetic types of FSGS barely respond to immunosuppressive therapies and overtreatment prior to transplantation should be avoided. The response of children with an idiopathic type of FSGS to immunosuppressants is superior to those with genetic FSGS. However, many children with idiopathic FSGS do not enter complete remission if they are undertreated, e.g. by short term immunosuppressive monotherapies. If immunosuppressive treatment fails, these patients will have to undergo renal transplantation. However, as the unknown pathogenetic mechanisms may persist, more than one third of these patients with idiopathic FSGS develop a rapid recurrence of SRNS responding poorly to further long term therapeutic attempts. Conclusion: The aim of this review is to show that, by contrast with previously published data, new treatment options taking into account recently identified genetic etiologies of SRNS, and in idiopathic forms superior results of an intensified treatment mode, currently lead to a different, more effective approach of childhood SRNS with lesions of FSGS.",

Urine NAG, a sensitive marker for proximal tubular damage, was found to be correlated with proteinuria, patient's age, serum ferritin, duration of deferoxamine, and duration of receiving blood transfusion.

            "text": "Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, PR China Introduction: Alport syndrome is a hereditary glomerulonephritis caused by COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5 gene mutations. It is manifested by hematuria, sensorineural hearing loss, ocular lesions and progressive renal failure. In order to understand the disease via clinical aspect and genetic aspect, a retrospective study was carried out based on data from Chinese Alport syndrome patients. Method: Clinical data including manifestations, renal pathology, type IV collagen alpha chains staining, cochlear and ocular abnormalities were collected and analyzed. PCR amplification of mRNA or genomic DNA of (IV) chains was applied to detect mutations. COL4A gene mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Data or parameters obtained from this study were compared to others published previously by other investigators based on Caucasian population. Result: There were 146 un-related index cases of Alport syndrome enrolled in this study, which included 104 males and 42 females. Among them, 134 patients were diagnosed with X-linked Alport syndrome and 12 patients (8.2%) with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. No autosomal dominant hereditary mode of Alport syndrome was identified. Almost half patients (58%) presented with hematuria as the onset symptom, the rest part of patients (42%) presented with hematuria and proteinuria at the onset of the disease. Around 20% of patients manifested with nephrotic proteinuria. Non-glomerular hematuria was reported in about 20% of Alport patients. It seemed that 17% of patients was de novel mutation of COL4A5. There were 48% of Alport patients with hearing loss and 57% of patients with ocular lesions. One confirmed X-linked Alport syndrome patient was also diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. Mutation analysis revealed that, in this study, 51% of X-linked Alport syndrome patients with point-mutation and, only 4% of patients with large deletion in COL4A5 gene. Conclusion: The clinical features revealed in this study in Chinese patients were similar to the previous reports, in addition to the prompt that higher portion of patients with proteinuria at the disease onset and small portion of patients with non-glomerular hematuria. While large deletion of COL4A5 gene was less than the other reports. annual report). This study was done to identify pediatric renal transplant patients with high risk for allograft thrombosis and develop a risk stratification protocol for post-operative anticoagulation. Method: We screened every patient at the pretransplant evaluation for thrombophilic risk factors including Antithrombin III, Protein C or Protein S deficiency, Activated Protein C resistance, Factor V Leiden, MTHFR or Prothrombin gene mutation, Hyperhomocysteinemia, High Factor VIII, high Lipoprotein (a), Dysfibrinogenemia, and Antiphospholipid Antibodies. The patients were assigned a risk category (Level I-IV) based on the presence of thrombophilic risk factors. Their postoperative anticoagulation plan was pre-determined based on their risk level [table1]. Heparin drip was initiated a few hours after the transplant and titrated to achieve a 1.5 fold aPTT level. Anticoagulation was changed to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on day 2-4, when the risk of major bleed was over, and serum creatinine had normalized. Result: Ten patients (aged 2-17 years) have been screened and 8/10 were found to be at high risk for thrombosis (3 were in Level II or 5 were in level III). The thrombophilic factors (number of patients) identified were prothrombin gene mutation (2), MTHFR (8), Lupus anticoagulant (2) and low protein S (2). Six patients have undergone renal transplant. All were successfully treated with LMWH postoperatively. No patient has developed allograft thrombosis. 1/5 patients developed a peri-renal hematoma requiring evacuation 7 days after the surgery, but completed prophylactic LMWH therapy. Conclusion: Thrombophilia is markedly common in pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Universal screening can stratify risk and allow an effective intervention to reduce that risk. Our Institution has developed a unique risk stratification protocol to identify patients at high risk for allograft thrombosis and prevent this complication by post-operative anticoagulation. However; larger scales, prospective randomized control trial using this protocol are needed. Introduction: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the major form of dialysis in use for infants and children with chronic renal failure (CRF). We evaluated the current status of children on PD in Korea. Method: In May 2008, questionnaires were sent to the pediatric nephrologists via e-mail. The questionnaires were about epidemiology, PD modes and adequacy, growth, blood pressure, laboratory findings and medications. Four centers replied and those data were reviewed. Result: A total of 103 patients were included in this study. Male to female ratio was 1.6:1. Mean age was 11.5 \u00b1 4.9 years (0~19 years). Primary renal diseases diagnosed were as follows: primary glomerular disease (34%), chronic pyelonephritis-reflux nephropathy (14.6%), systemic disease (9.7%), renal dysplasiahypoplasia (8.7%), heredofamilial disease (6.8%), vascular disease (3.9%), drug-induced nephropathy (1.0%), and unknown (12.6%). PD modalities were as follows: CAPD (42.7%), CCPD (27.2%), NIPD (11.7%), and Hybrid (18.5%). Weekly Kt/V was 2.1\u00b12.0 (0.3~4.1). Results of peritoneal equilibrium test (PET) were as follows: low 36.8%, low average 31.6%, high average 19.7%, and high 11.8%. Z-score for weight was -1.00\u00b11.20 (-4.54~2.50). Zscore for height was -1.55\u00b11.65 (-9.42~1.87). Growth hormone was administered in 24.3% of patients. Systolic blood pressure (BP) for their ages and heights was as follows: < 50 percentile 27.2%, 50~90 percentile 33.0%, 90~99 percentile 10.7%, and > 99 percentile 13.6%. Anti-hypertensive drugs were administered in 62.1% of patients. Laboratory findings were as follows: hemoglobin 10.5\u00b11.4 g/dL, calcium 9.7\u00b1 0.7 mg/dL, phosphorus 5.4\u00b1 1.4 mg/dL, parathyroid hormone 324.2\u00b1342.8 pg/ml. Conclusion: Primary glomerular disease was the most common cause of CRF. CAPD was the most prevalent PD modality. Dialysis doses were variable. Low and low average peritoneal transport type were common. Growth disturbance were noted in many patients. Some patients had hypertension even with antihypertensive drugs. Hemoglobin level was slightly low. Calciumphosphorus levels were maintained adequately, but many patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism. Introduction: Peritonitis remains one of the major complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD) despite advances in Tenckhoff (TK) catheter design and dialysis techniques. This study examined factors associated with peritonitis and TK outcomes in children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) over the past two decades. Method: All TK catheter insertions performed in 78 paediatric patients with ESRD (median age at diagnosis at end-stage renal failure of 12.2 years, range 0.07-20 years) between December 1985 to May 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. Peritonitis rate was calculated as number of episodes/patient-year. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was done using the log-rank test. Poor outcome was defined as catheter failure and removal. Factors associated with peritonitis studied include age at TK insertion, coiled vs straight catheters and exit site infection. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine correlations.",

The incidence of peritonitis decreased from 1.2 episodes/ patient-year in 1997 to 0.29 episodes/patient-year in 2006. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolated organism (19.2%) followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococci (9.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (8.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.2%), and Candida albicans (6.0%). Logistic regression analysis showed that use of straight-catheters was significantly correlated with peritonitis (p= 0.022 OR=2.37 95%CI 1.13, 4.95). Median catheter survival was 50.2 months (range 0.3-120.2 months). Peritonitis was the primary cause of TK catheter removal (46.7%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly shorter lifespan of TK catheters in those affected with peritonitis (48.7 months, 95% CI 9.6, 56.4) compared to those without peritonitis (63.7 months, 95% CI 28.0, 99.5). Logistic regression analysis showed that only peritonitis was predictive of poor TK catheter outcomes (p<0.001, OR=4.62, 95%CI 1.13, 4.95). Probability of poor TK outcome=1/(1 + e-r) where r=1.53(peritonitis)-0.71. Conclusion: Peritonitis is an important predictor of poor TK outcome with a shorter lifespan. Introduction: Advanced medico-technological support has enhanced patient survival; other than medical outcome, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) becomes also an important outcome measure for chronic illnesses like those in ESRD program. Method: This study was conducted at our Paediatric Nephrology Centre in June-July 2006 and March-April 2008. In 2006, all Chinese patients aged < 21 years enrolled in ESRD program for more than three months were recruited. In 2008, we recruited new eligible patients, and interviewed again those patients switching from automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) to renal transplantation (TX). A standardized Chinese questionnaire with subsequent transformed scores of 0-100 was used to reflect the HRQOL in 7 aspects, including general well being, physical ability, school/work performance, peer activities and relationships, family activities & relationships, sleep problems, worries and concerns. Result: Twenty-three patients undergoing APD and 27 transplanted patients were interviewed. APD and transplanted patients and their parents gave highest scores to family relationships (83-93) and peer activities & relationships (79-90) and lowest scores to physical activities (44-71). Comparing with APD patients, transplanted patients reported significantly less sleeping problems (92 vs. 80; p=0.019). In parents' perspective, transplanted patients had significantly less sleeping problems (91 vs. 71; p=0.02), better physical activities (67 vs. 44; p=0.045) and higher total scores (80 vs. 68; p=0.042). Six eligible patients switched from APD to TX. After TX, patients and their parents gave higher total and individual scores but all did not reach statistical significance except parents viewed significantly improved peer relationship (89 vs. 80; p=0.011). Conclusion: APD and transplanted patients have not much problems in peer and family relationship despite disease burden. With good dialysis care and support, patients undergoing APD have comparable HRQOL as transplanted patients except significantly more sleeping problems that may be explained by the procedures of APD during sleep.",

SRL was introduced at a median time of 16 months posttransplant (range 2-90 months). CNIs were discontinued in 14 and reduced in 1. All were biopsied prior to conversion. Complete follow up was available for 353 patient-months of SRL treatment (mean 23\u00b113 months/recipient). SRL was discontinued in one because of upper limb oedema and one graft failed due to nonadherence. SRL was otherwise well tolerated. Mean cholesterol levels 12 months after SRL were similar to baseline (4.78\u00b11.25 vs 4.86\u00b1 0.77 mmol/L, baseline vs 12 months post conversion respectively) but there was an increase in the use of statin therapy (mean atorvastatin dose 1.7 vs 11.3 mg/day; baseline vs 12 months.

Introduction: Chronic PD for children in Singapore was instituted in 1988 at the National University Hospital. However, adult renal nurses provided the dialysis services during the first 10 years. As children with end stage renal disease have special needs, in 1998, a dedicated pediatric renal nursing team was recruited to manage the programme. This study was conducted to determine the impact of the specialist pediatric renal nursing service on PD-related outcomes during the 2 nursing periods. Method: Data from all children (n=82, mean age 12.10\u00b15.33 years) who entered the dialysis program during the two 10-year dialysis periods were analyzed: Period 1 from January 1988 to December 1997 (n=21,) and Period 2 from January 1998 to December 2007 (n=61). Rates of peritonitis, exit site infection, and modality change per patient-year of dialysis were used as indicators of nursing practice. The difference between the 2 study periods was compared using Poisson Regression. Result: The mean ages of the patients at start of dialysis in Period 1 (10.36\u00b15.12 years) and Period 2 (12.70\u00b15.32 years) were similar. The peritonitis rate per patient-year was significantly higher in Period 1 (1.10) compared to Period 2 (0.30), with a relative risk of 1.68 (95% CI 1.13-2.50) (p=0.01). The exit site infection rates per patient-year was also worse in Period 1 (1.21) compared to Period 2 (0.25), with a relative risk of 2.09 (95%CI 1.39-3.13) (p<0.001). Although 38% of children in Period 1 compared to 28% in Period 2 had modality change due to peritonitis, there was no significant difference in the rate of modality change per patient-year between Period 1 (0.21) and Period 2 (0.09). Conclusion: Establishment of a specialist pediatric renal nursing team for the management of children on chronic PD resulted in a significant improvement in the outcomes as measured by the decrease in technique-related complications. Introduction: While most patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) achieve remission with daily corticosteroid therapy, 10-20% are resistant (SRNS) and about 30% show steroid dependence (SDNS). We examined the efficacy of treatment with rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, in patients with SRNS or SDNS refractory to standard therapy. Method: Following ethical approval and parental consent, patient demographics, renal diagnosis, previous therapeutic regimens and biochemical parameters such as serum albumin, creatinine, immunoglobulins and urinary protein to creatinine ratio were recorded. Rituximab was administered by IV infusion at a dose of 375 mg / m2 once weekly for 4 weeks in SRNS and for 2 weeks in SDNS. All patients continued to receive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors, alternate-day prednisolone, or both; cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was given for 6 months. For patients with SDNS, rituximab was administered while in remission. Result: Sixteen patients (9 boys) including 11 with SRNS (5 initial resistance; 6 late resistance) and 5 with SDNS, between the ages of 4 and 14 years were included. Renal histology showed minimal change disease (MCD) in 5 and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 7 of the patients biopsied. The duration of nephrotic syndrome was 4\u00b1 1.2 years prior to inclusion and the mean follow-up after treatment was 1.2\u00b10.4 years. All patients had received conventional immunosuppressive therapy (including cyclophosphamide and calcineurin inhibitors) prior to receiving rituximab. In patients with SRNS, the mean ratio of urinary protein to creatinine decreased from 7.2 at baseline to 1.8 at last follow-up. The mean serum albumin level rose from 1.7 g/dl (1.7 in initial; 1.6 in late resistance) to 2.6 g/dl (1.9 in initial; 3.1 in late resistance) and the mean cholesterol level declined from 482 to 278 mg/dl at last follow-up. The rise in serum albumin was more in MCD group than in those with FSGS, although the difference was not statistically significant. Following treatment, the one-year outcome was as follows: complete remission (1), partial remission (9), non-response (1).In the sub-group with steroid dependence, remission was sustained during a mean follow-up of 0.7\u00b10.1 years. The differences in leukocyte counts and levels of IgG were not significant, serum creatinine levels remained stable throughout the study and none of the patients had serious infections. Conclusion: Rituximab was used in difficult NS with mostly favourable outcome and no serious adverse events. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of rituximab in patients with NS needs further evaluation and prospective randomized controlled trials. Method: This is a retrospective cohort study. Medical records of all patients aged 1 to 18 years with first episode steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) seen in Princess Margaret Hospital between 1997 to 2006 were reviewed. Patients who were previously treated were excluded from the study. Patients were divided into two groups. Group I included patients treated with short course steroid, while group II included patients treated with long course steroid. Clinical parameters including age, sex, relapse rate, rate of sustained remission, mean duration of hospital stay within the two-year follow up were compared. Result: A total of 46 patients were included in the study. Group I consisted of 22 patients (mean age of 5, M:F=17:5). Group II consisted of 24 patients (mean age of 6, M:F=15:9). The demographics were comparable between the two groups. Patients treated with long course steroid had significantly lower relapse rate (58% versus 90%, P=0.018, fisher's exact test. Odds ratio=7.1, 95%CI 1.35-37.7), higher rate of sustained remission (log rank value=10.5, P=0.0012), and shorter mean duration of hospital stay (16d versus 23 d, P=0.017) at the end of twoyear follow up. No significant side effects of long term steroid such as growth retardation and hypertension were identified. Conclusion: In our experience, 6-month therapy is superior to 2month therapy for the treatment of first episode SSNS in children. It reduces subsequent relapse rate without increasing the frequency of severe side effects related to steroid use. Introduction: Cellular Crescent is a common pathological change of renal disease, which indicates that the renal disease is severe. Since cellular crescent can reverse after timely aggressive therapy, earlier detection of it is of great help for therapy. Although renal pathology is a golden standard for assessment of crescent, its application is limited because of the inherent disadvantage. Glomerular expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), \u03b2-catenin and cytoker-atin19 (CK19) have been confirmed to associate with the severity of cellular crescent, their potential clinical applications were investigated in this study aimed to find non invasive urinary crescent biomarker. Method: Firstly, 124 renal disease patients including 52 with cellular crescent and 72 without cellular crescent, and 20 healthy controls were studied. The urinary level of MCP-1, \u03b2-catenin and cytokeratin19 (CK19) were detected by ELISA method. The severity of cellular crescent was reflected by crescent index which evaluated by morphometric method. The sensitivity and specificity of the three molecules in urine for diagnosis of cellular crescent were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Then, the results were tested by another 80 patients with renal disease including cellular crescent group (n=41) and non cellular crescent group (n=39), and 25 healthy controls. Result: For the first 124 patients, urinary MCP-1, \u03b2-catenin and CK19 levels correlated with crescent index significantly (r=0.75, r=0.21, r= 0.63, p<0.01).By ROC analysis, the area under curve (AUC) of urinary MCP-1, \u03b2-catenin and CK19 were 0.691, 0.686 and 0.501, respectively. For the second patients group, the AUC of urinary MCP-1, \u03b2-catenin and CK19 were 0.83, 0.678 and 0.569, respectively. Conclusion: The urinary level of MCP-1 and \u03b2-catenin seemed to be potential non invasive marker for cellular crescent, especially for MCP-1. The finding might help guiding the timely aggressive treatment for patients with cellular crescent. (MsPGN) . The starting dose of CsA was 3-5 mg\u2022kg-1\u2022d-1, adjusted to maintain a trough level of 100~200 ng/ml in the first 6 months. After one year, a low dose of CsA(1~3 mg\u2022kg-1\u2022d-1)with a a trough level of 40~70 ng/ml was accepted to maintain remission for 1 year. Result: (1) Complete remission, partial remission and resistant to CsA were observed in 65%, 20% and 15%, respectively. Eleven patients who was complete remission discontinued CsA, 5 (45%) patients relapsed.",

This study aimed at identifying factors associated with long-term relapsing disease post-cyclophosphamide therapy. Method: Clinical and histopathological data of all children with steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant MCNS who underwent renal biopsy and received 12-weeks of cyclophosphamide as second-line treatment were reviewed. Poor long-term outcome was defined as presence of any immunosuppressive medication 2 years post-cyclophosphamide therapy. Parameters studied included gender, race, age at diagnosis, hypertension, hematuria, and serum creatinine at initial presentation, global sclerosis, mesangial expansion, tubular atrophy and IgM deposits on renal biopsy, and early poor response, defined as no response or relapse within 2 months post-cyclophosphamide therapy. Factors predictive of poor long-term outcome post-cyclophosphamide therapy were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Result: Forty-six children had MCNS, 21 (45.6%) were steroiddependent and 25 (54.4%) steroid-resistant. Median age at disease onset was 2.9 years (range 1-12.1 years). Mean follow-up period from start of cyclophosphamide therapy was 11.53\u00b16.35 years. Twenty-nine (63%) children responded to cyclophosphamide initially, however 2 (6.9%) relapsed within 2 months post-cyclophosphamide therapy. Seven (15.2%) were hypertensive, 7 (15.2%) had hematuria and 4 (8.7%) had elevated creatinine at presentation. Thirty-one (67.4%) of biopsies were positive for mesangial IgM, 10 (21.7%) had global sclerotic lesions and 11 (23.9%) had tubular atrophy. Regression analysis showed that only early poor response to cyclophosphamide was predictive of poor long-term outcome (p<0.018, OR=5. 8, ). Using this model, the probability of poor long-term outcome post-cyclophosphamide therapy was expressed by the equation: P=1/(1+exp-r), where r=1.75(early poor response)-0.74. Early poor response to cyclophosphamide had a positive predictive value of 84.7% in predicting poor long-term outcome. Conclusion: Steroid-dependent or resistant MCNS patients with early poor response to cyclophosphamide therapy were more likely to have long-term relapsing disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy. Introduction: Glucocorticoids are mainstay of management of nephrotic syndrome. Deflazacort is a newer glucocorticoid which not only have similar efficacy but also lower incidence of side effects compared to prednisolone, however its high cost is the major drawback. In order to assess whether Deflazacort can replace prednisolone we compared effectiveness and the adverse effects of prednisolone and Deflazacort. Method: 60 patients (30 on deflazacort therapy & 30 on prednisolone therapy) of Nephrotic syndrome in Nephrology Unit, Pt.J.N.M.Medical College & GBG Kidney care Hospital, Raipur from april2007 to april2008 were studied. All patients were subjected to routine investigations. Result: \u2022Among the patients treated with prednisolone 66.67% were having hypocalcemia whereas it was 40% among the patients treated with Deflazacort (p value<0.001). \u2022Hyperphosphatemia was present in 40% of the patients on prednisolone while it was 20% among the patients on deflazacort (p value<0.005). \u202240% of the nephrotic syndrome patients treated with prednisolone had raised calcium phosphate product while it was raised in 20% of the patients treated with Deflazacort (p value<0.005). \u202270% of the patients on prednisolone therapy had hypercholesterolemia whereas it was 53.33% with Deflazacort therapy (p value<0.02). \u2022Posterior subcapsular cataract developed in 6.66% of the patients treated with prednisolone while none of the patients with deflazacort developed it. \u202280% of the nephrotic syndrome patients treated with prednisolone had steroid induced side effects like cushing's habitus (moon like face), purple striae, muscular weakness, psychiatric disturbances while it was seen only in 40% of the nephrotic syndrome patients treated with Deflazacort (p value<0.001). \u2022Relapse rate was 30% among the patients treated with Deflazacort while it was 43.33% with prednisolone (p value<0.1).",

Introduction: Urinary tract infections(UTIs) are not uncommon findings in febrile pediatric patients and approximately one third of patients of UTI may have renal scars. This research was intended to establish the relationship between duration of fever and renal scars. Method: 143 patients medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) fever as defined by an axillary temperature \u226537.5\u00b0C, 2) accurate history of fever duration and the use of antibiotics 3) no previous history of UTI and 4) positive urine culture. We observed whether the longer fever duration could be associated with the development of initial renal defects and subsequent renal scars, increased C-reactive protein(CRP), leukocytosis and the presence of vesicoureteral reflux(VUR). Result: 1) Patients with longer fever duration after antibiotics showed more frequent initial renal defects(P=0.014). However, fever duration before antibiotics was not associated with the development of initial renal defects(P=0.244). 2) Incidence of renal scar was increased with fever duration before antibiotics(P=0.006) and fever duration after antibiotics(P=0.015). 3) CRP was correlated with the fever duration after antibiotics(r=0.287, P=0.003). 4) There were no relationships between fever duration and VUR(P>0.05). Conclusion: Our data suggest that fever duration before/after antibiotics are significantly associated with the increased development of renal scars in pediatric UTI. Introduction: Universal agreement in investigating urinary tract infection (UTI) in children with imaging is lacking. This study serves to evaluate the selective approach of imaging infants < 6 months old with UTI according to risk features suggested in UTI Guidelines by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2007. Method: This is a retrospective study of infants < 6 months old with first UTI from Jan 02 to Dec 06 having complete set of imaging studies including ultrasound kidneys (US), micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) and DMSA scan at > 6 months (those with known urological abnormalities and antenatal hydronephrosis were excluded). They were evaluated against a set of risk features according to NICE UTI guidelines i.e. serious illness, poor urine flow, abdominal mass, raised SCr, septicaemia, non-Ecoli UTI and failure to respond to treatment with suitable antibiotics within 48 hrs. Those having any one of these were classified as atypical and those having none as typical.",

Atypical group (32) had risk features of non-Ecoli UTI in 16, septicaemia 7 and failure to respond to antibiotics 9. None had other risk features. There were 6 scars, 26 refluxing ureters and 6 hydronephrosis (> 5 mm). In typical group (83), there were 23 scars, 22 refluxing ureters, 5 hydronephrosis, 2 hydroureter-hydronephrosis and 1 PUJ. 76 infants had normal US; and if only those (7) with abnormal US were further investigated as suggested by the Guidelines, 18 refluxing ureters and 23 scars would be left undiagnosed. Conclusion: According to the NICE UTI Guidelines, typical UTI will only be investigated with US, and only abnormal US will be followed by MCU. For the present group, the suggested selective imaging approach would leave a significant number of VUR and renal scars undiagnosed. Not until the significance of long term outcome of scars & VUR is clarified definitely, it may not be an optimal practice for infants < 6 months old with first UTI. Introduction: Introduction: Percutaneous renal biopsy is a safe procedure. Fear of complications require hospitalization adding to treatment cost, which may be avoided. Aim: To study the timing of complications associated with a percutaneous kidney biopsy in children in order to determine the feasibility of it being performed as a day-care procedure. Method: Material and Methods: Children undergoing kidney biopsy over 2 yrs included prospectively. Coagulation studies and renal parameters noted. Procedure not carried out under real time ultrasonography. Children sedated with midazolam and ketamine. Vital parameters monitored as a baseline and complications noted on a 3 hrly basis for 24 hours post-procedure, for timing of onset and duration. Statistical analysis: Univariate analysis using chi-square test. Result: Results: 90 children (M:F::2:1) age11 m-12 y underwent a kidney biopsy. Nephrotic syndrome with atypical features was the commonest indication. Hematuria noted in 27% but only 3.3% required a transfusion. No child required any surgical or radiological intervention. All complications when occurred had onset < 6 hrs but most resolved by 12 hrs. Only 6 (6.6%) children continued to have hematuria beyond 12 hrs and this continued beyond 24 hrs. The occurance of a complication had no bearing to the age, gauge of needle used, baseline serum creatinine or the underlying kidney disease. Monitoring of vital parameters could not predict hematuria before it was manifest. Conclusion: Conclusions: Age, underlying renal disease, baseline investigations and monitoring of vital parameters could not predict significant hematuria early. Complications after a kidney biopsy are obvious by 6 hrs, resolving in most within 12 hrs. All patients undergoing kidney biopsies should be kept under observation for minimum 12 hours. Those with macroscopic hematuria beyond 12 hrs or requiring intervention may be admitted. In others the kidney biopsy can safely be carried out as a daycare procedure. Introduction: Between 2003 and 2008 urine screening was carried out in some kindergartens and schools in Shanghai. We hope to discuss the characteristics of kidney diseases detected in urine screening. Method: In Shanghai 46,171 school children (2003) (2004) (2005) and all children in kindergartens (2006-2007, about 270 ,000 children/year) underwent urine screening. Children with abnormal results were asked to be followed up in designated hospitals. We documented and analyzed the follow-up records. Result: During 2003-Feb 2008, 419 children (207 boys and 212 girls, from 2-year to 18-year) with abnormal screening results went to the hospitals, among whom 367 were hematuria, 36 were proteinuria, 5 were hematuria combining with proteinuria, 11 were leucocyturia and 4 cases diagnosed as nephrotic syndrome. 39 cases underwent renal biopsies which consisted of 32/39 hematuria, 3/39 proteinuria, 3/39 nephrotic syndrome and 1/39 hematuria with proteinuria. The pathologic diagnosis showed as following: 20/39 showed minor change, 2/39 minimal change disease (MCD), 7/39 IgA nephrology (IgAN), 7/39 thin basement membrane nephrology (TBMN), 2/39 mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), 1/39 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). We noticed that four patients with nephrotic syndrome were detected in kindergarten by urine screening. Seven children were diagnosed with IgAN by renal biopsy. 4/7 were long term hematuria, 2/7 proteinuria and 1/7 hematuria associating with proteinuria. Conclusion: Most problem detected in urine screening was mild in our study but some may have poor outcome which needed close follow-up for a long time. Urine screening was well done in kindergartens in Shanghai. Introduction: The prevalence of obesity all over the world has been rising. It is well documented that obese patients are at greater risks to develop hypertension, coronary vascular disease, and insulin resistance, and more attention has been paid to the impact of obesity on kidney, recently. Since the first description regarding the relationship between massive obesity and proteinuria in 1974, increased evidence demonstrated that obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG) should be identified as an isolated complication of obesity in adults. It is, however, unclear whether this condition exists even in children with obesity. This study was conducted to know whether obese children have higher risk of developing to ORG as well as in adult.",

We examined for abnormalities of the complement pathway in patients with atypical HUS. Method: EDTA samples were collected from index patients presenting with atypical HUS and their families, before instituting plasma therapy or blood transfusion. Plasma concentrations of C4, C3, factors B, H and I, CD46 and anti-factor H antibodies were measured. Genes encoding factor H, I and CD46 were sequenced. Screening by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for complement factor Hrelated (CFHR) 1 and CFHR3 genes was performed. Patients with anti-factor H antibodies received double-volume plasmapheresis daily till activity subsided, followed by 4 alternate-day and 4 twice-weekly plasmapheresis. They also received IV immunoglobulin (2 g/kg), IV cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 q 3-weekly) and prednisolone (1 mg/kg). Result: Fourteen patients (12 boys) from 7 months to 15 yrs were studied. Renal histology showed features of thrombotic microangiopathy involving arterioles and capillaries. One patient had complete deficiency of factor H due to a homozygous mutation. Eight patients tested positive for anti-factor H antibodies (titer 194-32,000 UA); 7 had antibody titer above 1500 UA and were dialysis dependent. The antibody titer and disease activity reduced in all patients; 7 progressed to end stage renal disease. Genetic studies showed homozygous deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes in 4 patients with anti-factor H antibodies. Conclusion: Antibodies to factor H appears to be an important cause of atypical HUS in India. The antibody titer correlated directly with the disease severity. Deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes might genetically predispose to development of anti-factor H antibodies, and occurrence of HUS. Introduction: To determine the safety and effectiveness of oral highdose mizoribine (MZR) for children with severe Type 1 membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Method: Between 2003 and 2007, 5 children diagnosed with primary Type 1 MPGN by renal biopsy were treated with intravenous highdose methylprednisolone pulse therapy, followed by alternative-day prednisolone that was slowly tapered off over several years. However, 2 of them continued to show signs of proteinuria and hypocomplementemia or disease flare despite steroid therapy, and they were both were diagnosed with severe Type 1 MPGN. Each patient underwent a repeat renal biopsy at 23 or 19 months after the first biopsy. Repeat biopsy findings revealed no histological improvement in either of them. Therefore, they were both administered with daily oral MZR due to unsatisfactory steroid effects. The dose of MZR was adjusted to achieve a peak blood level of around 3.0 mcg/ml to maximize clinical efficiency. Result: Urinary protein excretion decreased from 3+ to trace in one of the patients at 18 months and from 2 + to negative in the other at 13 months after starting MZR therapy. The serum C3 level increased to the normal level in the patient with persistent hypocomplementemia. The dose of prednisolone was also tapered in both. Neither of them developed adverse reactions. Conclusion: Our results suggested that MZR at an optimal blood concentration is effective and safe for patients with severe Type 1 MPGN. Further evaluation is warranted for the use of MZR therapy in a long-term follow up study, and children with severe type 1 MPGN should be included in a prospective-randomized trial of MZR therapy.",

We estimated the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in children with CKD, and examined the effect of cholecalciferol supplementation on serum levels of 25,OHD, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphorus. Method: In a prospective interventional study children with estimated GFR between 15 to 89 ml/min/1.73 m2 were given 6, 00,000 IU of cholecalciferol. Children on vitamin D supplements and those with serum calcium level >10.5 mg/dl and phosphorus > 6.0 were excluded. Primary (25,OHD, PTH levels) and secondary (calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase levels and urinary protein excretion) outcomes were measured at baseline and 6 weeks. Result: 40 children (85% boys) with a mean age of 7.7\u00b13.8 (range 2-15) yr were studied. 33 (82.5%) children had vitamin D insufficiency at baseline. Of these, 15 children had 25,OHD levels < 15 ng/ml. The median serum 25,OHD levels increased from 18.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], ng/ml at baseline to 48. 5 (42.1-56.8) ng/ ml at 6 weeks (P=0.000) while the PTH levels declined from 55.3 (47.1-77.8) pg/ml to 41.4 (31.2-56.8) pg/ml (P= 0.01). The calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels did not change significantly from the baseline. The median urinary protein to creatinine ratio decreased from 0.30 (0.03-1.5) to 0.61 (0.08-2.26) mg/mg (P=0.07). There was no correlation between serum 25,OHD and PTH levels. Conclusion: Vitamin D insufficiency is highly prevalent in children with CKD and cholecalciferol supplementation appears to be an effective treatment in correcting vitamin D status and reducing PTH levels. Introduction: The aim of this study was to explore the role of human adipocyte derived stem cells (hADSCs) in a repair of acute renal failure. Method: For renal failure, acute ischemic tubular necrosis was induced Spraque-Dawley rats by clamping bilateral renal arteries for 40 min. hADSCs obtained from elective liposuction procedures. After steps of isolation, stem cells were seeded at 1~2\u00d7105/cm2 in complete medium. Dextran-coated iron was used as a labeling agent and Poly-llysine (MW 70~150 kDa) as a transfection agent. Before releasing the clamps, three shots of iron labeled stem cells (1\u00d7106/0.2 cc) for left kidney or PBS for right kidney were injected at upper, middle and lower part of renal cortex directly. MRI images, one day after reflow, confirmed presence of iron labeled cells in the renal cortex. The examination on both kidneys was done after 1, 3 days, 1,2,4,6,10 and 15 weeks(n=5 in each). The evaluation of the degree of tubular necrosis (PAS stain) and the locations of stem cells(prussian blue stain) was done by light and electron microscopically. Result: Serum creatinine on day 1 was 2.7\u00b10.4 mg/dL, on day 3, 2.2 \u00b11.4 mg/dL and on the first week 0.8\u00b10.3 mg/dL. After then, it has no significant change among groups. Tubular injury was scored by counting the number of damaged tubules in random selected 100 cross sectioned tubules. On day 1, 47\u00b116 of left side and 76\u00b111 of right; day 3, 11\u00b117 and 55\u00b121 were scored. From 1 week group, the tubular necrosis had been recovered well. Cells positive stained for prussian blue located at peritubular area. However, tubular epithelial cells or glomerular cells were not positive. Electron microscopically, fine iron granules with electron density were found in their cytoplasm, which were thought as injected stem cells. FISH for anti-human chromosome (CEP) 17 probe were positive to those cells. Conclusion: We demonstrate stem cells contribute to repair the tubular epithelium in acute renal failure model, not by tubulogenesis directly but by indirect effects, which should be evaluated. Introduction: A composite heterozygous NPHS2 mutation was verified for the first time in a Chinese familial FSGS, which resulted in a truncated (podocinV165X) and a missense mutant podocin (podocinR168H). Both mutant sites were localized to a same domain in podocin C-terminu. Nevertheless, our previous studies showed that the binding characteristics of both mutant podocins with N-and C-terminal antibodies were obviously different, which suggested that the two mutant podocins might play a different role and involve different pathogenesis. This study here aimed to explore the different roles of the two mutant podocins on podocyte injury via in vitro experiment. Method: Immortalized mouse podocyte was transfected with the vectors containing wild or mutant podocins. Podocyte injuries were evaluated by FITC-Annexin V. Effects of wild and both mutations on nephrin, CD2AP and the recently identified podocyte ion channel TRPC6 were displayed by immunofluorescence staining and western blot. Cytosolic free Ca2+ was measured with fluo-3AM. To evaluate TRPC6 role in cell injuries, podocyte was co-transfected with TRPC6 siRNA and wild or mutant vectors. Result: Both wild and mutant podocins significantly increased podocyte apoptosis. Wild and V165X was partially targeted to membrane, whereas R168H was only distributed around nuclei. Both wild and mutant podocins showed co-localization with nephrin, CD2AP and TRPC6. Nephrin, CD2AP and TRPC6 were obviously up-regulated in R168H-podocytes, while TRPC6 and CD2AP was evidently increased in wild and V165X-podocytes, respectively. A cortical cytoskeleton was observed in wild and V165X-podocytes, whereas R168H seriously disturbed cytoskeleton arrangement. Both wild and mutant podocins increased cytosolic free Ca2+ level. Podocyte apoptosis, Ca2+ level and expressions of other slit diaphragm molecules did not change in just TRPC6 knockdown cells. With the knockdown of TRPC6, Ca2+ level and podocyte apoptosis decreased significantly only in wild and V165X-podocytes. Conclusion: PodocinR168H caused much more significant changes of podocyte molecules and cytoskeleton, which prompted that podocinR168H plays more critical role on podocyte injury. Method: Forty-one children aged 1 year to 18 years admitted at St AlZahra Hospital, Isfahan and St Ali Asghar Hospital, Tehran, Iran with biopsy proven idiopathic FSGS were enrolled. They were divided into two groups according to the time of progression to renal death. Renal death was defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 50 ml/min/1.73m 2 or decreasing GFR more than two times compare to the baseline. Reaching renal death in less or more than two years was assumed as rapid progressors (RP) or slow progressors (SP) respectively. The intron 16 of ACE gene was amplified by PCR technique.Statistical significance was regarded as P<0.05. Result: Twenty-eight patients were male and 13 were female.In 15 RP patients the genotype distribution was DD-26.6%,II-6.7%,ID-66.7%.In 26 SP patients the genotype was similar (DD-38.6%,II-7.6%,ID-53.8%, P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences for ACE I/D gene polymorphism between two groups of patients (p>0.05). Conclusion: Our study revealed no correlation between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and rapidity of progression of FSGS to ESRD in Iranian children. Introduction: Some studies have shown that molecules produced by podocyte may influence glomerular endothelial barrier properties. we found the level of Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (Angptl3) mRNA was significantly increased in kidneys of children with minimal change nephrotic syndrome and the level of Angptl3 was increased in the glomerulus of adriamycin rats along with the development of proteinuria. We also confirmed expression of Angptl3 in cytoplasm of podocyte. Experiments confirmed that Angptl3 could bind to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 of umbilical venous endothelial cell. Integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 is also one of the integrin heterodimers that the glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) express. So, we postulate Angptl3 secreted by podocyte have effect on GEnCs and may take part in development of proteinuria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Angptl3 on the barrier properties of GEnCs and the possible signaling pathway. Method: Permeability of GEnCs was assessed by transendothelial resistance (TEER) and by the diffusion of fluorescein isothiacyanatelabeled bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA). The level of phosphospecific Akt were delected by Western blot. Result: We demonstrated that Angptl3 induced decrease in TEER and increase in permeability rates for FITC-BSA, and phosphorylation of Akt was markedly evaluated after GEnCs was treated with Angptl3. We showed pretreatment of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, prevented Angptl3-induced decrease in TEER and inhibited increase in FITC-BSA.",

Introduction: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease in adulthood. Postnatal overnutrition following IUGR may be of pathogenic importance for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our previous animal studies have shown IUGR adults have higher urinary excretion of protein and blood pressure than controls and postnatal overnutrition following IUGR cause more severe hypertension and proteinuria than IUGR itself. The aim of this study was to identify the possible pathogenesis of kidney disease in IUGR and the effect of postnatal overnutrition by comparative proteomic approach. Method: IUGR was induced in rats by isocaloric protein restriction in pregnant dams. IUGR pups were divided into two groups, fed either standard-protein diet (IUGR group) or high-protein diet (HP group). At the age of 12 weeks, kidney proteins were obtained from each group. 2-DE, staining, mass spectrometry and database searching were used. The 2-DE test was repeated three times in each group. Result: The 2-DE image analysis detected average 727 +/-58 spots in IUGR group, 740 +/-43 spots in HP group and 758 +/-53 spots in control group. The differential proteomic expression analysis between IUGR and control group found 12 proteins had significantly differential expression, which were transcription regulators including prohibitin and ribonuclease UK114, structural molecules including capping protein, enzymes including glutathione s-transferase alpha-1, retinal dehydrogenase1, transketolase and so on. Subsequently, the differential proteomic expression analysis between IUGR and HP group found 16 proteins had significantly differential expression, which were transcription regulators including ribonuclease UK114 and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, structural molecules including ezrin and gamma-actin, enzymes including catalase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and so on. Conclusion: Data from this study may provide, at least partly, valuable experimental evidence of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of kidney disease in IUGR and the effect of postnatal overnutrition. Introduction: NPHS2 exonic mutations have been reported extensively in sporadic primary nephrotic syndrome (NS) in Caucasian populations, but are uncommon in Asians. This study examined the NPHS2 promoter region for gene variants and analysed their association with NS in Singapore Chinese children. Method: Direct sequencing of the 5' promoter and all 8 exons of NPHS2 was performed on genomic DNA from 58 patients with primary sporadic NS (age of diagnosis ranging from 1-20 years) and 55 normal controls. Statistical correlation of genotype with disease was performed using SNPStats (http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/index. php?module=Snpstats). Result: We identified five NPHS2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in our patients and controls -three were located in the 5' promoter region (-670C/T, -116C/T and -51G/T); with two in exon 8 (954T/C and 1038A/G). No missense mutations were found. The genotype frequencies were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The SNPs in the promoter region were found to be associated with NS under different model fits (-670C/T, recessive model, p= 0.042; -116C/T, over-dominant model, p=0.019; -51G/T, additive model, p=0.039). No association with NS was observed for the SNPs in exon 8. Haplotype analysis was performed subsequently for the three promoter region SNPs, which were only weakly linked (-670C/T and -116C/T: r2=0.346, p=0; -670C/T and -51G/T: r2=0.215, p=0; -116C/T and -51G/T: r2=0.098, p=7e-4). Four haplotypes: TCG, CTG, CCT and CCG were observed. The haplotype CCT, was significantly associated with NS (OR: 2.4, 95%CI 1.05-5.50) (p= 0.04). This haplotype was responsible for 20% of nephrotic patients, but was only present in 9% of healthy controls. Thirty of the 58 patients (51.7%) were steroid-resistant. Further analysis revealed that the haplotype frequency was 25% in steroid-resistant patients, twofold that of steroid-dependent patients (14%). Conclusion: The promoter haplotype of NPHS2 may confer susceptibility to sporadic NS. Functional studies are needed to validate this hypothesis and elucidate possible disease-causing mechanisms. Introduction: The actin cytoskeleton is thought to play a critical role in maintaining podocyte structure and function. Some evidences have shown that angiotensin II (AngII) could induce the cytoskeleton changes in podocytes. Nevertheless, the relevant signal transduction pathway is not fully clarified. Some studies suggested that ERK1/2 MAPK pathway might be connected with the cytoskeleton of some types of cell. Here, it was explored whether ERK1/2 pathway is involved in the effects of AngII on podocyte actin cytoskeleton. Method: Mouse podocyte clone (kindly provided by Prof. Peter Mundel) was cultured at 33\u00b0C for proliferation,then transferred to 37\u00b0C and cultured for 1 week to be differentiated. After podocyte was treated with AngII (10-7M) for 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min, the protein expressions of ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were detected by western blotting. TRITC-phalloidin was directly used to stain the actin filaments (F-actin) of podocytes. To verify the key role of ERK1/2 in the podocyte cytoskeleton alterations resulted from AngII, U0126, the specific inhibitor of ERK1/2 pathway was applied for 1 h before AngII treatment.",

            "text": "Result: Phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased markedly (P<0.05) at 15 min and persistently to 60 min after AngII treatment. Normal podocytes displayed an obvious and parallel actin stress. In AngII treated podocytes, a cortical pattern of F-actin mainly on cell membrane was observed at 30 min, and marked depolymerization of which occurred obviously at 45 min and persisted to 120 min. Pretreated with U0126 for 1 h, the ERK phosphorylation was completely inhibited, and the abnormal arrangement of F-actin was partially attenuated in AngII treated podocytes. Conclusion: AngII activated the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, which at least partially contributed to the rearrangement of podocyte actin cytoskeleton induced by AngII. Introduction: Nephrotic syndrome is one of the most common problems among the renal diseases in children. Many patients, about 40% of whom responded well previously to prednisolon, however, relapse frequently, when treatment with prednisolon is tapered off or stopped. Factors for predicting such relapse are yet to be established. Dyslipidaemia during remission could be a predictor of relapse in nephrotic syndrome Method: A total of 26 hospitalized children of 1-8 years age, suffering from nephrotic syndrome 1st attack were included as cases. Another 22 hospitalized children of same age group, not suffering from any kind of renal diseases, were included as controls. Lipid profile were measured in both cases and controls after initial enrollment. All the cases were treated with oral prednisolon adequately according to ISKDC protocol. During remission, lipid profile were again measured and on the basis of presence of abnormal lipid profile at that time, cases were divided into 2 groups. All the cases were followed-up every monthly for subsequent 6 months to observe development of subsequent relapse. Result: Among the cases, group-I consisted 16 patients who had normal lipid profile during remission and group-II consisted 10 patients who had abnormal lipid profile during remission. Both groups of cases showed higher mean level of s.cholesterol(p<0.001), s.LDL (p<0.001), s.TG (p<0.001) and s.Lp(a) (p<0.001) than those of controls during initial diagnosis. During remission, group-II patients showed higher mean serum cholesterol (332.9\u00b1105.19 mg/dL vs. 183.13\u00b116.89 mg/dL; p<0.001), serum LDL (252\u00b1101.67 mg/dL vs. 119.19\u00b121.33 mg/dL; p<0.001), and serum TG (182.8\u00b173.83 mg/dL vs. 93.31\u00b120.95 mg/dL; p<0.001). 5 patients out of 10 patients of group II (19% of total case) developed subsequent relapse within 6 months follow-up. Among the relapsers, mean cholesterol (334\u00b146 vs. 232\u00b134 mg/dL; p<0.05) was significantly higher than that of nonrelapsers of group-II patients. On the other hand, no patient of group-I developed relapse within 6 months follow-up. Conclusion: It may be concluded from the present study that elevated lipid profile, specially serum cholesterol during initial remission, may be a predictor of subsequent relapse in idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome. Result: Abnormal urine analysis were found in 20.95%(total 22) of sibling contacts. The incidence of nephritis among 105 siblings was 12.38%(13 siblings). This was clinical in 5(4.76%) and subclinical in 9(8.57%) cases and the calculated ratio of subclinical \\clinical disease was 1.8.There were 5 siblings (4.76%) whose urine analysis could not be explained by appropriate test. Introduction: Rare cases of IgG -associated mesangial glomerulonephritis(IgG GN) defined by exclusive or predominant mesangial IgG deposits were reported first by Sato et al. (1993) . and subsequently 10 pediatric cases were reported by Yoshikawa et al. (1994) . Previous reports suggested that the prognosis of IgG GN is relatively benign but recent report suggested that prognosis of IgG GN is highly variable. Also the recurrence of IgG GN in a renal transplant was reported by Fakhouri et al. (2002) . Such a recurrence highlights the specificity of this type of glomerulonephritis. We experienced two pediatric cases of IgG GN proven by renal biopsy with different clinical manifestations. Method: Case 1 (Nephrotic syndrome) A 4-year-old girl with nephrotic syndrome admitted because of general edema. The patient`s urinalysis showed proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Renal biopsy was performed because of relapsed nephrotic syndrome. Light microscopic finding was nonspecific with almost normal histology. Immunofluorescent findings showed diffuse segmental IgG(+) and IgM(+) deposits in the capillary walls, and focal segmental spotty C4 (trace), C1q(trace) deposits. Electron microscopic findings showed focal portion of mesangial electron dense deposits without mesangial widening. After diagnosed as IgG GN, ACE inhibitor, steroid and cyclosporin were admitted with a stable clinical course more than one and half years. Case 2 (Asymptomatic microhematuria) An 11-yearold girl admitted for evaluation of microsopic hematuria detected through mass school urinary screening program. Renal biopsy was performed for exact diagnosis. Immunofluorescent findings showed focal segmental IgG(+), IgM(+/-) and C3(+/-) deposits. Electron microscopic findings showed focal portion of mesangial electron dense deposits without mesangial widening. She is doing well without any clinical symptom with normal blood chemistry but persistent microhematuria for last two years. Conclusion: We report two pediatric cases of IgG-associated mesangial glomerulonephritis proven by renal biopsy with distinct different clinical manifestations. Introduction: This paper presents a study on the correlation between angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/ deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the susceptibility and clinical characteristics of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) in children. Method: 58 APSGN child patients were collected as case group and 100 normal children were adopted as control group, who are all Han nationality. Salting-out method was used to extract the genomic DNA. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was performed to identify the ACE (I/D) gene polymorphism in all subjects. Renal function, complement component 3 (C3), the serum ACE, 24 hours urine total protein were measured and X-ray film of chest and echocardiography were examined in APSGN group. All statistical analysis were performed using the statistical package for social science 11.5 (SPSS11.5). P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: The frequencies of the DD genotype and D-allele in the case group were higher than the control group (41.4% vs. 22.0%, P<0.05; 54.3% vs. 43.0%, P<0.05, respectively). In the case group with albuminuria, the frequencies of D-allele and the DD+DI genotype were higher than that without albuminuria (62.5% vs. 42.9%, P= 0.047; 81.8% vs. 50.0%, P=0.018). There were no relationship between ACE genotypes and sex, age at onset of APSGN, hematuria, hypertension, C3 levels and complications. Conclusion: ACE-D allele is correlated with the inheritance susceptibility of APSGN and with the occurrence of albuminuria, which implies a worse renal prognosis. It is suggested to further study the pathogenesis of APSGN in the context of ACE-D for early treatment and better prognosis as well as prevention and alleviation of complications.",

            "text": "Departments of Pediatrics, Microbiology, and Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore Introduction: Our previous studies have shown that over-expression of IL-13 gene resulted in podocyte injury with downregulation of nephrin, podocin and dystroglycan and concurrent upregulation of B7-1 in the glomeruli, inducing minimal change-like nephropathy (MCN). This could either be due to a direct effect of IL-13 signaling on the podocyte, or a consequence of IL-13-induced B7-1 danger signaling function. This study examined the relationship between upregulation of B7-1 expression and TLR-4 gene expression in the IL-13 overexpression model of MCN. Method: Recombinant rat IL-13 gene was inserted into a mammalian expression vector, pCI, and transfected into Wistar rat quadriceps by invivo electroporation weekly till sacrifice at day 72. Glomerular gene expression of nephrin, podocin, dystroglycan, IL-13 receptor subunits, B7-1 and TLR-4 were examined using real-time PCR and expressed as an index against \u03b2-actin. Glomerular B7-1 and TLR-4 protein expression were also examined by immunofluorescent staining. Result: While glomerular gene expression was significantly upregulated for IL-4Ra, and IL-13Ra2, and downregulated for nephrin, podocin and dystroglycan, B7-1 gene expression index (mean\u00b1SEM) was also upregulated in the IL-13 transfected rats (0.011\u00b10.001) compared to controls (0.005\u00b10.001) (p<0.05). The nephrotic rats showed strong patchy glomerular staining for B7-1 on immunofluorescence. Concurrently, glomerular gene expression of TLR-4 was significantly higher in the IL-13 transfected rats (0.0011\u00b10.00004) than in controls (0.0008\u00b10.00005) (p<0.001). This was further confirmed with immunofluorescence which showed strong glomerular staining for TLR-4. B7-1 gene expression in IL-13 transfected rats correlated significantly with serum IL-13 levels (r=0.57, p<0.01), as well as TLR-4 (r=0.50, p=0.001). Conclusion: The strong expression of B7-1 associated with TLR-4 in the glomeruli of nephrotic rats suggests that this could be one of the signaling process by which IL-13-induced podoycte injury occurs. Further studies will be performed to explore the potential relationship between IL-13, B7-1 and TLR-4 using siRNA.",

Nephrologist and urologists are frequently faced with patients with asymptomatic haematuria that remains unexplained after cystoscopy and renal imaging. We performed renal biopsy for 73 cases who were diagnosed asymptomatic hematuria in our admission patients from January 1997 to March 2008 and wanted to analyze the kidney histological categories of asymptomatic hematuria in children. Method: 73 cases were diagnosed asymptomatic hematuria in our study. All 73 cases were performed by renal biopsy.All renal tissues were examined by light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Result: All the 73 patients were identified glomerular diseases by renal biopsy. In our study the most common histological categories of asymptomatic hematuria were as follows:24 cases of IgA nephropathy,19 cases of MsPGN (mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis), 8 cases of EcPGN (endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis), 5 cases of IgM nephropathy(6.8%),5 cases of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(FSGS)(6.8%),5 cases of membranous nephropathy(MN) (6.8%),4 cases of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis(MPGN) (6.0%),2 case of minimal change disease(MCD) (2.7%),1 case of thin basement membrane nephropathy(TBMN) (1.4%).

            "text": "Introduction: Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare disease demonstrating considerable thrombi material consisting of lipoprotein in the glomerular capillary lumen. Mutation of apoprotein E (APOE) was identified as a cause of LPG, and these patients have been considered to show poor prognosis leading to chronic renal failure even after renal transplantation. We present the successful treatment of a 14-year-old Japanese girl with an 8-year history of LPG. Result: Case: Proteinuria was incidentally detected when this patient was 3 years old in 1998. To characterize her nephrotic syndrome, she underwent renal biopsy at age 4. The pathological specimen showed dilated capillary lumina with massive lipoprotein thrombi in every glomerulus. Thereafter she was referred to our hospital and followed from June 1999. Based on pathologic findings and genetic analysis, we diagnosed her as having LPG. Her father and younger sister also showed the same mutation of apo E, ?APOE Sendai?, but were not affected by LPG. Initially, we administered probucol, enalapril, and dipyridamole. Since the response was not satisfactory, we changed probucol to bezafibrate and atorvastatin calcium hydrate in March 2003, and added valsartan in December 2004. Since then, her clinical and laboratory findings showed the following improvements: serum albumin increased from 2.6 to 4.1 g/dl, serum APOE decreased from 11.0 to 7.1 mg/dl, and urinary protein disappeared. However, creatinine clearance deteriorated from 160.8 to 69.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 over 9 years, but she has remained above 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, which is within normal limit. Under informed consent, we performed re-biopsy for pathological re-evaluation in April 2007, and confirmed that nearly all intraglomerular lipoprotein thrombi had vanished. Conclusion: LPG has been recognized as a refractory and progressive disease, but we have successfully treated this patient with antilipidemic drugs, antiplatelet drug, and angiotensin II receptor blocker.",

            "text": "Introduction: The present study aimed to investigate ocular complication arising from nephrotic syndrome and its treatment in children. Method: Retrospective data were collected from the medical records of 62 patients with nephrotic syndrome who were treated at the East-West Kidney Disease Research Institute of Kyung Hee University from January 2000 to December 2007. The treatment consisted of intravenous methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg/day administration for 3 consecutive days and followed by oral MPD 0.8 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. This was taken as one course and was carried out until remission. Among the 62 patients, 13 patients had ocular complications. We compared the age, sex, duration of treatment, time to attaining remission and initial laboratory findings between the two groups. Result: Among the 13 patients, cataract was found in 6 patients (4.5%) and glaucoma in 7 patients. (5.2%) The mean duration of treatment was 24.83\u00b118.5 months in the case group and 20.52\u00b111.56 months in the control group. There was no statistical difference (pvalue 0.61) between the two groups. In correlation, there was no statistically significant difference among the duration of treatment, laboratory profile extracted at the time of the first hospital admission and occurrence of ocular complications. On the other hand, it took 235\u00b1299 days to the remission in the case group and 89\u00b1175 days in the control group and it was statistically different (p-value 0.03). Conclusion: In consequence, the occurrence of ocular complications in children who had nephrotic syndrome was related with the time to remission, and the total dose of corticosteroid was in proportion to the time to remission. In other words, the total dose of administered corticosteroid is key factor in the occurrence of ocular complications. Therefore, pediatricians should be aware of the potential risk of developing ocular complications and its early detection.",

Method: The EBV-infected patient's clinic history in our department was analyzed, the clinic characters, diagnosis and treatment were reviewed being companied with the review of pertinent literature. Result: The patient was a 4 years and one month old boy. After infected with EBV, the swollen eyes and the hematuria under microscope (5-8 RBC /HP) appeared. The urinary protein was (+), renal function was disorder and blood urea nitrogen increased significantly (8.36 mmol/L). The histologic diagnosis by the renal biopsy was membranous nephropathy. He was treated by Ganciclovir. Prednisone, dipyridamole, piperazineFerulateTablets and ACEI were also given. The clinical symptoms disappeared in two years. The number of RBC in urine was 0-1/HP, the proteinuria was negative, the renal function and BUN were normal. Conclusion: A patient with edema, hematuria and proteinuria should be paid attention by pediatrician to avoid a missed-diagnosis or a misdiagnosis. A renal biopsy should be performed as soon as possible to identify the type of nephropathy. The proper treatment is also necessary. Introduction: The present study was a prospective multicenter clinical control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mycophenolate Mofetil Dispersible Tablets(MMF) in addition to prednisone on refractory nephrotic syndrome. Method: 142 patients from nine clinical trials centers were divided into two groups,where there were no significant differences between the two groups on age, gender, and clinical categories. They were treatment group(87 patients) treated with MMF and control group(55 patients) treated with pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide(IVC) in addition to prednisone. 87 patients of MMF treatment group were treated with fulldosage(30~40 mg/Kg.d) MMF for at least six months, then gradually tapered persisted till one year if with efficacy, otherwise stop MMF; 55 patients were treated with IVC(10 mg/Kg.d\u00d72 d/2 w) for 3 months, then with IVC(500 mg/m2) at 4, 7, 10 month repectively.Both groups were combined prednisone(0.5~1 mg/Kg.d) for 2~3 months,then gradually tapered. Urine protein, liver function, renal function and drug side effect were observed regularly for one year. Result: Of the 87 patients who received the MMF protocol,complete remisson was achieved in 58 patients,partial remission in 16 patients, early effect in 9 patients,and no improvement in 4 patients,total remission rate [complete remission(CR) and partial remission(PR) and early effect(EE)] were 95.45%,negative proteinuria rate was 77%; while 35 patients, 9 patients, 1patient,10patients, 81.8%, 65.4% respectively in CTX protocol group.There were no significant difference in negative proteinuria rate between two groups.While effective rate of MMF protocol group was significantly higher than CTX protocol group.Furthermore MMF was found more effective in reducing proteinuria,improving hypoproteinemia,oliguria,edema than CTX. MMF was better tolerated with lower adverse reaction rate, including transient elevated AST or ALT (three), infections (thirty two),gastrointestinal symptoms (eleven), menstrual disorder (one), muscle waver (one).Side effects of 55 patients who received CTX protocol included transient elevated AST or ALT (nine),infections (thirty),gastrointestinal symptoms (fifteen),hypohemoglobinemia (four),hypoleupenia (one),phalacrosis (one). Conclusion: The results demonstrated that combined therapy of MMF (20~35 mg/Kg.d) and prednisone (0.5~1 mg/Kg.d) show similar negative proteinuria rate with CTX protocol in treatment of RNS, Furthermore the former can shorten the induced remission time,and has lower side-effect rate.",

The hallmark of this disease is characterized by multiple relapses, which are usually responsive to steroids. A subgroup of children require steroids to be in remission and hence develop steroid dependence(SDNS) Infrequently less than 10% are resistant to steroid therapy(SRNS) Primary Focal Segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common cause of steroid resistance. Cyclosporine A (CsA) have been found effective in FSGS. In Pakistan use of CsA is limited therefore we did this study to see the response to CsA in primary FSGS in children suffering from NS. Method: Total of thirty cases were included in the study. Indication for starting CsA was steroid resistance (n=18) and steroid dependence (n=12) with steroid toxicity. CsA was given in a dose of 4-5 mg/kg body weight per day in 2 divided doses for a period of 12-24 months. Response to CSA seen after three months of therapy was categorized into: complete remission, partial remission or no response. Follow-up was continued for two years. Urine analysis, renal function and monitoring of CsA level was done. Any side -effects that developed were noted. Result: Maximum number of cases were seen in 6-10 years age group 13/30 (43.33%) Male to Female ratio was 1:0.9. Complete remission was seen in 17/30 cases (56.67%) while 9/30 cases showed partial remission (30%). No response was seen in 4/30 cases (13.33%). Three out of this 4/ 30 cases went into chronic renal failure. Side effects noted were; gingival hyperplasia in 14/30 and hypertrichosis in 11/30 cases. Conclusion: CSA seems to be effective in the treatment of FSGS in at least 50-60% of the cases in Pakistan.",

Result: PAN not only induced the ultrastructural changes of GEpC, such as shortening and fusion of microvilli, but also separated the intercellular gaps and linear ZO-1. PAN induced oxidative stresses in time-and dose-dependent manners and increases of intercellular permeability which inhibited by anti-oxidants.

This study aims at evaluating the effect of the light microscopy(LM) and the automated urine flow cytometer(UFCM) in detecting the source of hematuria in children. Method: (1) 125 children who had been diagnosed as having glomerular diseases underwent renal biopsy. (2) The morning urine specimen from all 125 patients with glomerular diseases as well as 46 patients with non-glomerular were collected for erythrocyte morphological examination by LM. In addition, the samples from 47 patients with glomerular diseases and 36 patients with non-glomerular diseases were examined by using UFCM. The sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of glomerular hematuria according to different criterions by LM were tested. In this study, the positive rates of glomerular hematuria based on different urine specimen were also contrasted, which included as following: \u2460 morning urine and random urine specimen from 32 cases; \u2461 urine specimen containing a great deal proteinuria or without proteinuria; \u2462 urine samples containing different number of RBCs. Result: (1) This group of 125 children with clinical diagnosis of glomerular diseases was confirmed by renal biopsy. (2) The diagnostic criteria for glomerular hematuria were those with severe dysmorphic RBC\u226530% or dysmorphic RBC\u226570%.The sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing glomerular hematuria via LM was 92.8% and 97.8%, respectively. Whereas the corresponding rate from UFCM was 58.5% and 93.8%. (3) The positive rate of glomerular hematuria with the two methods in testing the same day's morning urine and random urine samples from the 32 cases with glomerular diseases was respectively 78% VS. 71.9%(LM) and 65.6% VS. 62.5%(UFCM). P>0.05. (4) By employing LM on the urine specimens from 22 patients with massive proteinuria and from 67 patients with isolated hematuria, the sensitivity reached respectively 81.8% VS. 91.4% (P>0.05). (5) The positive proportion of glomerular hematuria in RBC <100/ul group was lower than that of RBC 100-2000/ul group with LM, while no such differentiation was found in RBC<100/\u03bcl group when using UFCM. Conclusion: (1) This series of data indicated that if we use the diagnostic criteria for glomerular hematuria that dysmorphic RBC\u226570% or severe dysmorphic RBC\u226530%, the sensitivity and specificity are both higher. (2) Both specificity reached over 90%, but the sensitivity of the UFCM was lower. (3) The random urine specimen could be accepted with the two methods in children.",

Method: Clinical and pathological characteristics of 54 children with IgA nephropathy confirmed by renal biopsy were analyzed. 54 children with IgAN were divided into two groups according to their clinical features at the first onset: asymptomatic IgAN group (AsIgAN) and symptomatic IgAN group (SIgAN). Histologic changes were classified by Lee SM and Katafuchi semiquantitative scoring system. Result: 18 children were in AsIgAN group and 36 children were in SIgAN group. The degree of proteinuria in SIgAN group (2.3\u00b12.2 g/ d) was higher than that in AsIgAN group (0.4\u00b10.3 g/d) at the time of biopsy (P<0.05). Although asymptomatic IgAN children were mainly of Lee's type I~II, there were 11% with Lee's grading IV~V and 27% of children with interstitial injury. Symptomatic IgAN children were mainly of Lee's type II~III, there was no significant difference between two groups(P>0.05).Urine microablumin increased in 87% children presented with microscope haematuria. After an average of (26.9\u00b18.8)months follow-up, only one case of Lee's V progressed into renal failure and the others maintained normal renal function. Conclusion: Although children with Asymptomatic IgAN have tiny clinical symptoms, severe renal pathological lesion and poor outcomes also occurred.

Method: randomized controlled trial.Patients with INS who responded to initial course of prednisolone, either standard or long regimen were included and followed for one year. The standard regimen consisted of prednisolone 60 mg/m2/day for four weeks followed by 40 mg/m2 every alternate day single morning dose for further four weeks. The long regimen consisted of prednisolone 60 mg/m2/day for six weeks followed by 40 mg/m2 every alternate day single morning dose for further six weeks.There were 93 children who fulfilled the criteria of the study, 47 from long group and 46 from standard group. The two groups did not differ in age, blood pressure, serum albumin, serum cholesterol or serum Creatinine prior to the initial prednisolone therapy Result: Cumulative prednisolone dose was significantly higher in the long regimen group than the standard group (p=0.001).

We report 4 cases with such complications, seen over a 10-year period at a tertiary pediatric renal unit. Method: Detailed laboratory evaluation and imaging were done. Anticoagulant therapy was used as indicated Result: Case 1. 1.5 year-old-girl with steroid responsive NS (SRNS) was in remission with prednisolone (PRED) 1.5 mg/kg on alternate days (AD), when she had vomiting, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and right hemiparesis. MRI of brain showed thrombosis of sagittal and left transverse sinuses. She was managed with supportive care and gradually made a complete recovery. Case 2. 7 year-old-boy had SRNS with frequent relapses since age 1.5 years. While in remission with 20 mg PRED on AD, he developed coldness of left leg and bluish discoloration of toes. Doppler study showed narrowing of anterior and posterior tibial arteries in middle and distal parts. Anticoagulant therapy lead to gradual, complete recovery without tissue loss. Case 3. 5 year-old-boy with steroid dependent NS was in remission with PRED 20 mg on AD. He acutely developed severe headache and vomiting with papilledema. CT scan was normal but MRI revealed sagittal sinus thrombosis. He fully recovered with supportive care. Case 4. 10 year-old-boy had steroid resistant NS with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Treatment with enalapril and PRED on AD lead to partial response (absence of edema, increase in serum albumin, mild proteinuria). He developed increasing swelling of the right upper extremity, without pain and fever. Doppler studies showed thrombosis of right jugular and subclavian veins. He was treated with anticoagulants and made a complete recovery. None of the patients had a preceding acute illness or taken diuretics. Renal function parameters were normal. Conclusion: Thrombosis of major vessels, mostly venous but occasionally arterial, may rarely occur in NS without any precipitating illness (eg hypovolemia, sepsis). Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial. Introduction: Homocysteine is a non-protein forming amino acid, whose metabolism is dependent on the vitamins (folic acid, B12 and B6), and the enzymes (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and cystathioninesynthetase). Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular complications & atherothrombosis in several clinical settings in which renal function is impaired, but its prevalence in nephrotic syndrome has not been investigated in detail eventhough this syndrome provides an excellent model to study a possible link between albuminuria, proteinuria & hyperhomocysteinemia. Conclusion: \u2022Reduced antioxidant was more in males as compared to females. \u2022Children between 6-12 years of age had markedly reduced antioxidant levels. \u2022Dyslipidemia was more common in males than females. \u2022Dyslipidemia and Low levels of serum albumin were associated with markedly reduced antioxidant levels. \u2022All the patients experiencing relapse of nephrotic syndrome had markedly reduced antioxidant levels. Introduction: Method: A 6 year old girl admitted with complaints of facial puffiness, pedal oedema, gradual abdominal distension, decreased urine output, off & on since last 3 month. She was taking treatment irregularly in suburb. Patient has significant family history, had 9 siblings, Out of which 3 female children suffering from nephrotic syndrome died at age of 8-10 years due to nephrotic syndrome & its complications. On investigating 2 sisters showed nephrotic range proteinuria (24 hr urinary proteins 3.2 gm/24 hr& 3.6 gm/24 hr), deranged thyroid profile and Hyperlipidemia. Both sisters were treated on the line of nephrotic syndrome with Deflazacort, Torasemide, Losartan, Ranitidine, Atorvastatin. Patient's step mother died after 6 month of diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Investigation of the patient's mother also revealed nephrotic range proteinuria, Hypothyroidism & Hyperlipidemia. Male siblings were asymptomatic and their investigations were within normal limit. On general examination, her weight was18 kg (>100 percentile), height-110 cm, pulse-100/min, BP-110/70 mm of Hg in lying down position, facial puffiness, mild pedal oedema. Per abdominal examination showed abdominal distension, stretched umbilicus, shifting dullness. Other systemic examinations are within normal limit. On investigating her Hb-11.5 gm%,TLC-8900/ mm3,ESR-35 mm/hr,Blood sugar-96 mg%, Urea-96 mg%, creatinine-1.5 mg%,serum protein-4.5 gm%,s.albumin-2.4 gm%,s.globulin-2.1 gm%, 24 hr urinary proteins-4.5 gm/24 hr, S. cholesterol-355 mg/dl,S.triglyceride-155 mg/dl, S.LDL-276 mg/dl, S. HDL-45 mg/dl, S.VLDL-34 mg/dl, Urinalysis showed -Albumin +++ , pus cell 3-4/hpf. Ultrasound abdomen showed-bilateral medical renal disease with moderate ascitis with bilateral pleural effusion. Renal biopsy was done which showed minimal change disease.She was treated with Deflazacort, Torasemide, Losartan, Ranitidine, Atorvastatin. Patient showed improvement & was discharged with urinary albumin trace & weight reduced from 18 kg to13.5 kg. Result: Conclusion: Numerous inflammatory & non inflammatory diseases affects the glomerules & lead to alteration in glomerular permeability, structure,& function. A genetic basis has been identified in number of renal diseases. This is a case of Familial nephrotic syndrome, a genetic disorder with rare presentation seen in paedriatic age group. Podocin. This complex is now known to serve as signaling platform through their phosphorylations, as well as filtering barrier structure. TRPC6 was also identified as an SD-component, and its activity is regulated by diacylglycerol, a product of phospholipase C (PLC). Some of the TRPC6 mutations enhance its channel activity, and elevated level of TRPC6 is also observed in acquired nephrotic syndromes. TRPC6 activity can also be regulated by phosphorylation by a tyrosine kinase, Fyn. We hypothesized the role of TRPC6 phosphorylation in the interaction with SD-components. Method: Phosphorylation of TRPC6 was examined by stimulation such as EGF or by coexpression with Fyn. The interaction between TRPC6 and SD components was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation using transfected HEK293T cells and GST-pull-down analysis. Result: Tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 was observed upon EGFstimulation or coexpression with Fyn. Among several SD-proteins, Nephrin was found to bind to TRPC6 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Pull-down analysis using GST-Nephrin cytoplasmic domain revealed that phosphorylated TRPC6 but not non-phosphorylated TRPC6 bound to Nephrin. This interaction was observed irrespective of Nephrin phosphorylation, indicating that phosphorylation of TRPC6 but not Nephrin is crucial for this interaction. Phosphorylated TRPC6 also bound to PLCgamma and N-terminal portion of TRPC6 was responsible for this interaction. By mutational analyses using a series of single phenylalanine substitutants of TRPC6, we identified distinct tyrosine residues crucial for the interactions with Nephrin or with PLCgamma. Conclusion: Tyrosine phosphorylation of TRPC6 regulates its association with Nephrin and PLCgamma. Phosphorylation-dependent trimeric complex of TRPC6/Nephrin/PLCgamma may regulate the integrity and function of SD.",

            "text": "Child Health Department Faculty of Medicine University of Indonesia, Indonesia Introduction: Proteinuria is the basic problem in nephrotic syndrome which leads to raise morbidity and mortality in such patients. Massive proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome is likely to cause major complications, i.e. acute renal failure, severe infection as peritonitis, anemia, growth disturbance, thrombosis due to hypercoagulability state, and hypovolaemic shock. Although, the majority of children with classic idiopathic nephrotic syndrome respond to steroid treatment, and called steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome, but more than half children develop frequently relapsing or frequently relapsing with steroid dependency and some get steroid resistant. Urinary TGF-\u03b21 excretion correlates with the amount of filtrated protein and duration of exposure protein to tubular cells. TGF-\u03b21 is a pluripotent fibrogenic cytokine which through some pathomechanisms causes interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis, ending with nephron loss. Method: This study was a cross sectional study to compare urinary TGF-\u03b21 and protein levels in children with nephrotic syndrome remission, relapse, and steroid resistant to its level in children without kidney disease. Urinary protein level was measured as urinary protein and creatinine ratio in spot urine sample taken in the morning. Urinary TGF-\u03b21 level was determined using Elysa (Quantikine kit for human TGF-\u03b21 immuno assay) Result: A hundred twenty children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome were enrolled in this study, consisted of 34 children with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome remission, 31 children with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome relapse, and 55 children with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. Thirty-five children without kidney disease were recruited as the control group. The highest urinary protein level was found in children with nephrotic syndrome relapse, significantly higher than the level in steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. But, urinary TGF-\u03b21 level in children with nephrotic syndrome relapse was as high as its level in children with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome, significantly much higher compared to the level in nephrotic syndrome remission and those in children without kidney disease. There was a moderate positive correlation between urinary TGF-\u03b21 and protein excretion. Introduction: The glomerular diseases pose a common diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in pediatric nephrology practice. Percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) is commonly performed to obtain renal tissue for histological diagnosis, decide about prognosis and monitoring of response to treatment. The most common histological lesions in primary nephrotic syndrome are minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranoproliferative or mesangio proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN/MesPGN) and membranous GN. There are specific histopathological findings in secondary GN like lupus /HSP nephritis and in different forms of congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS). The objective of this study was to determine the indications, types of histological lesions and complications of renal biopsy in children with glomerulonephritis Method: This is a hospital based prospective study of 75 children of 1 mo to 15 yrs age who underwent renal biopsy from June 2005 to April 2008 at National Institute of Child Health and The Kidney Centre, Karachi. Ultra sound guided automated Monopty Bard gun technique was used in all children. Coagulation profile and renal function assessment and complete blood count were done prior to biopsy. B.P was controlled if high and acute infection was treated before biopsy. Children were kept NPO 4-6hrs before and after biopsy. Patients were monitored clinically during and 24 hrs after the procedure. Children received short-acting anesthesia and few of them underwent general anesthesia. All samples were taken from the left kidney and studied under light microscopy and immuno-fluorescent (IF) stain. Children with persistent gross hematuria after 24 hr had a post-biopsy ultrasonography.",

Majority of children (45/60%) were of 5-15 years age group. The most common indication for PRB was primary nephrotic syndrome (46/61.33%) followed by secondary GN (10/13.33%), congenital NS (9/12%) and nephritic nephrotic syndrome (8/10.66%). Among the primary NS(46), steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome were 27(36%), steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome in 14 (18.66%) and there was partial response in 5(6.66). Mean number of passes was 2. 3(2-4) . PRB was successful in 71 patients (96.08%) and failed in 4(5.3%) cases. It was cortico-medullary tissue in 41 and cortical in 27 samples. Mean number of glomeruli was 24. 8(2-88) . Among the 71 diagnostic samples, the most common histology was FSGS (25/35.21%), followed by MCD (20/26.66%%), MPGN/Mes PGN (11/15 .49%) and membranous nephropathy (6/8.45%) . Diffuse mesangio proliferative (post infective) and HUS/acute cortical necrosis was seen in 3 cases. Finish type of CNS in 2 and IgM nephropathy in one. Immunoflourescent stain was positive in 33 out of 67 samples (49.25%)stained. It was positive in all MPGN/Mes PGN (11) , membranous (6), Lupus (2/3)/ HSP (2) and 52% of FSGS. Over all, complications were observed in 4 patients (5.33%). Transient gross hematuria (<24 hrs) was observed in 3 and self-resolving perirenal hematoma in one. No patient experienced severe pain or infection at the biopsy site. Conclusion: Steroid resistant primary NS was the most common indication for biopsy and FSGS was the most common histological lesion followed by MCD and MPGN.

Method: With levamisole or cyclophosphamide, authors had treated 49 patients of frequent relapsing nephrotic children who had visited BNU Hospital from Jan., 2001 until July, 2007. We compared therapeutic effects of levamisole (L-group, 23 patients) and cyclophosphamide(C-group, 26 patients) by relapse rates and cumulative dose of steroid before and after trial of these drugs. Result: Pathological type: In L-group, eleven patients had renal biopsy in which ten patients showed minimal change and one patient showed FSGS. In C-group group, seventeen patients had renal biopsy in which eleven patients showed minimal change, five FSGS, one IgA nephropathy. Reduction in relapse rate: In L-group, relapse rate decreased from 4.28\u00b12.16 relapse/patient/year before levamisole trial to 2.34\u00b13.07 relapse/patient/year on levamisole for one year(p=0.02). In C-group, relapse rate decreased from 6.95\u00b14.86 relapse/patient/ year before cyclophosphamide to 4.81\u00b15.25 relapse/patient/year for one year after cyclophosphamide(p=0.04). Reduction in prednisolone dose: In L-group, the cumulative dose of prednisolone decreased from 704.76\u00b1296.42 mg/m2/month to 490.63\u00b1204.44 mg/m2/month(p< 0.01). In C-group it decreased from 896.35\u00b1632.46 mg/m2/month to 688.79\u00b1369.57 mg/m2/month(p=0.20). Conclusion: Both levamisole and cyclophosphamide treatment effectively reduced relapse rate and cumulative dose of prednisolone in frequent relapsing nephrotic syndrome in children. For the comparison of efficiency of both drugs, more studies including many of patients are needed in the future. ",

This study aims to determine the occurrence of metabolic bone disease in children with nephrotic syndrome with normal renal function. Method: Design: Cross Sectional Study Setting: Pediatric Nephrology Clinic at University of Santo Tomas Hospital Participants: Children aged 5-18 years with nephrotic syndrome with normal renal function, at least on 6 months steroid therapy Intervention: (a) Clinical and biochemical tests to determine risk factors for low bone mineral density (BMD) (b) Dual-energy x-linked absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine (L1 to L4) and whole body Main Outcome Measures: Bone mineral density Zscores and risk factors that would correlate with BMD Result: A total of 15 patients were included in this study (8 boys, 7 girls) . Mean age at diagnosis was 6.7\u00b13.9 years (1.6-12 years) while mean age at the time of DXA was 10.5\u00b13.6 years (5.8-18 years) . Only 2 patients (13.3%) have low BMD, both were males with younger age at diagnosis and at the time of DXA (3.2\u00b10.5 years and 6.8\u00b11.3 years, respectively) compared to those with normal BMD (7.3\u00b14.0 years and 11.1\u00b13.6 years, respectively). Duration of disease was the same between the 2 groups (3.8\u00b12.7 years, normal BMD; 3.6\u00b1 0.8 years, low BMD). None of those with low BMD had symptoms of hypocalcemia nor history of fracture. One patient with low BMD have regular intake of coffee (25-30 mg caffeine/day). Mean calcium intake for the 2 groups were within the recommended daily allowance (RDA) while mean vitamin D intake were below the RDA for both groups. All patients have normal serum ionized calcium except for one with low BMD who have slightly high level (1.39 mmol/L). Serum phosphorus was low in patients with low BMD while 2 patients with normal BMD have high levels. There was no difference in the mean cumulative steroid dose between the 2 groups (792.9\u00b1531.4, normal BMD; 859.4\u00b1 571.1 mg/kg, low BMD). Of the factors evaluated, only serum phosphorus statistically correlate with low BMD. Conclusion: Only 13% of the patients were found to have low BMD. Low serum phosphorus was the only factor found to significantly correlate with low BMD. Majority of our patients with nephrotic syndrome with normal renal function on \u2265 6 months of steroid therapy have normal bone mineral density. Introduction: Multiple proteins of coagulation cascade have altered level in nephrotic syndrome, in addition platelet aggregation is enhanced. Only 2% of children with nephrotic syndrome have thrombosis. Thromboembolic event is most likely if serum albumin is less than 2 gm/dl. Method: Multiple proteins of coagulation cascade have altered level in nephrotic syndrome, in addition platelet aggregation is enhanced. Only 2% of children with nephrotic syndrome have thrombosis. Thromboembolic event is most likely if serum albumin is less than 2 gm/dl. A 15 year old female patient came with complaints of facial swelling since 1 month which gradually progressed to generalized anasarca followed by burning pain in left hand fingers since 15 days associated with blackish discoloration of fingers since 12 days. Conclusion: Hypercoagulability is a complication seen in NS. Not only venous thrombosis is very common at any site but also spontaneous arterial thrombosis may occur. In nephrotic syndrome, thrombosis of major limb arteries is uncommon but feared complication. Glomerular deposits are a major pathologic feature of a wide range of human glomerulonephritides. Various patterns of mesangial glomerular deposits have been reported. Glomerular Ig deposits are encountered in a large number of primary and secondary glomerulonephritis, such as lupus or cryoglobulinemic nephropathy. Rare cases of primary glomerulonephritis defined by predominant mesangial IgG deposits.",

This article aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and pathogens of common serious infectious complications of children with nephrotic syndrome in order to contribute to a reduction of mortality rate of the disease. Methods: From November 2004 to August 2005, 41 episodes of serious infections of 35 children with nephrotic syndrome at Department of Nephrology, Children's hospital N01 were enrolled in a prospective case series study. Serious infections were the ones which can promptly cause death and need to be treated with intravenous antibiotic. Results: Mean age of the patients was 8 +/-4 years, male to female ratio was 1.86/1. 24.4% of infectious episodes occurred at the first onset of nephrotic syndrome while 75.5% of the others occurred at recurrent or steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome. 70.7% of the patients were being treated with only steroid or in combination with other immunosuppressant drugs. 100% of the infectious episodes occurred simultaneously in an active phase of nephrosis. Symptoms implying infectious complication include fever, leukocytosis above 15000/mm3, neutrophil count above 7500/mm3 and CRP above 20 mg/l which were in turn 68.3%, 68.3%, 75.6% and 51.2%. Three kinds of common serious infectious complications were primary peritonitis (34.1%), pneumonia (34.1%) and cellulitis (31.7%). Bacterial pathogens were isolated in 13/41 (31.7%) of severe infectious episodes: S. pneumoniae 17.1%, E. coli 4.9%, Pseudomonas spp 4.9%, Klebsiella spp 2.4% and Enterobacter spp 2.4%. 80% of isolated Gram negative bacteria were pathogens of infectious cases admitted hospital after 48 hours while 75% of isolated Streptococcus pneumoniae related to pre-admitted hospital infections. 80.5% of serious infectious episodes were successfully treated with Cefotaxime +/-Aminoglycoside and the mean therapeutic time was 9.3 +/-2.2 days. Death occurred in 2 cases of pneumonia, accounted for 4.9% of the overall mortality rate. Conclusions: Serious infections are common complications with a high mortality rate in the active stage of childhood nephrotic syndrome. Cefotaxime +/-Aminoglycoside is an appropriate initial antibiotic choice for treatment of serious infectious complications in nephrotic syndrome. Alternative therapeutic protocol should be a combination of Vancomycin for coverage of Penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and a Fluoroquinolone for coverage of Gram negative bacteria before available results of bacterial isolation.",

Reduced proteinuria has delay worsening of renal function and remission of proteinuria predicts a good long-term prognosis in children with nephrotic syndrome. Method: The aim of this study was to reduce proteinuria in persistent proteinuria patients. This prospective descriptive study was designed to study the effectiveness of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) on proteinuria reduction in steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome in children. Enalapril was given at starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day and stepped up 0.1 mg/kg/ day every 4 weeks until 0.6 mg/kg/day (maximum 40 mg/day) and losartan 1 mg/kg/day was added and stepped up to 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 100 mg/kg/day) for another 4 weeks. Result: During September 2003 through December 2007 we diagnosed 8 SRNS 5 male (26.5%) and 3 female (37.5%) with mean age at diagnosis 8.3+4.1 years (2.05-13 years) and age at enrollment 11.7+3.8 years (6-16 years) . Renal histology were 7 FSGS (87.5%) and 1 IgM nephropathy (12.5%). 75% of them were treated with oral cyclophosphamide. The result of combine treatment with high dose enalapril and losartan showed significant reduction on mean spot urine protein: creatinine ration from 9.85+2.25 to 3.64+1.59 (P<0.05) and 24 hr. urine protein from 182.79 +59.56 to 28.68+8.23 mg/m2/hr (P<0.05).

Since 50-70% of relapses follow minor infections, interventions that reduce the risk of infection associated relapses are valuable. In a randomized controlled trial, we examined if short-term (7-day), daily administration of prednisolone was effective in preventing infection associated relapses in patients with FRNS treated with alternate-day (AD) prednisolone with/without levamisole. Method: Following approval from the Ethics Committee & parental consent, 100 patients, between 1 and 16 yr-old with idiopathic FRNS (>2 relapses in 6 months) were included and stratified into those receiving long-term AD prednisolone (0.5-1 mg/kg) or AD prednisolone & levamisole. During intercurrent infections, patients were randomized to either continue the above therapy (non-intervention group) or receive the same dose of prednisolone every day for 7-days (intervention group). The duration of the study was 12-months. Result: Results for the first 6-months are presented. Patients in the intervention (n=50) and non-intervention (n=50) groups had similar baseline clinical & laboratory features. The frequency of infections was similar in the two groups. Mean (95% confidence intervals) relapse rates in the first 6-months in the intervention and nonintervention groups was 0.8 (0.3, 1.2) and 1.0 (0.5, 1.5) respectively (P=0.1). A higher proportion (62%) of patients in the former group had sustained remission compared to the latter (44%).

Prior to the biopsies, 33 were steroid dependence, 6 were relapsing, 1 was partially response and 8 were resistance. Kidney biopsies were performed 18.5 months (0-153) after the onset of NS. Forty-five patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (34), chlorambucil (6), cyclosporine (3) and prednisolone (2). At the last follow-up (median time after the biopsies 4.41 years), 24 patients (53.3%) were in remission, 20 patients (44.4%) were relapsing, and one was not responded to above treatments. The eGFR were increased to 162+50 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 with only one patient in CKD II. Conclusions: Relapsing, steroid dependence or resistant NS with IgM nephropathy were responded to alkylating agents with good long-term outcomes. Result: From 2004 to 2007, the total number of 92 kidney biopsies were performed in children with SLE. Twenty eight patients (30%) had LMN, twelve of them (43%) was mixed-type LMN (combination of class V and III or class V and IV). The mean age at diagnosis was 11.1 years old. The clinical of nephrotic syndrome was recognized in 36%. Hypertension was noted in 57%. The mean 24-hr urine protein and urine protein to creatinine ratio were 105 mg/kg/day and 6.0, respectively. The mean serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were 0.8 mg/dL and 107 ml/min/1.73 m2. The GFR of less than 90 ml/min/ 1.73 m2 was noted in 37% of patients. Most patients (86%, 79%) had microscopic hematuria and nephrotic range proteinuria, respectively. The mixed-type LMN had tendency to have lower initial GFR and higher serum creatinine than the pure membranous type. Conclusion: Based on the ISN/RPS 2003 classification, the incidence of MLN in this study is higher than the previous reports. The mixedtype group presents with lower GFR and higher serum creatinine than the pure type. Objective: To determine the clinical outcome of Thai children with SLE. Background Children with SLE especially those with nephritis are not uncommon among children with kidney diseases in Thailand. Due to its chronic nature, the disease can lead to growth and developmental impairment.The cost of care especially if kidney failure occurred is very high. Data collection for the whole country is needed in order to improve the care and prevent serious complication in these patients. Methods: The data of patients with SLE, age at diagnosis less than 15 years, diagnosed during 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006 in thirteen tertiary care hospitals were reviewed. Severity and complication of the disease were assessed every six to twelve months period using ECLAM index and SLICC/ACR damage index respectively. Results: There were 500 patients,77 (15.4%) male and 423 (84.6%) female. The mean age at diagnosis was 11.1 + 2.5 years (range 1-15 years). The patients were followed for a mean period of 21.2 months (range 0-61 months). Renal involvement was found in 410 patients (81.8%). WHO class 4 was the most common renal histopathology, which was found in 185 patients (52.7%). The mean ECLAM index at diagnosis was 6 + 2.7 and decreased significantly after treatment. Chronic renal insufficiency (CCr < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) was found in 11 patients (2.2%). Risk factor for chronic renal insufficiency was initial GFR< 60 ml/min/ 1.73 m2. Mean SLICC/ACR damage index in 324 patients who were followed for more than one year (mean follow up time 26.4 months) was 1.35.The damage frequently found in ocular (22.5%), renal (10.5%), neuropsychiatric (8.5%) and musculoskeletal (6%) systems. All patients received prednisolone. 62% received prednisolone plus other immunosuppressive drugs. Complete and partial renal remission were found in 60 and 27% of patients respectively.14 patients (2.8%) died in 1-39 months. The most common cause of death was infection.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Children with SLE especially those with nephritis are not uncommon in Thailand. Renal pathology of WHO class 4 is frequently found. With current immunosuppressive treatment, majority of patients achieve favorable outcome. However, infectious complication is the leading cause of death. Introduction: Cystic kidney disease has been linked to mutations in the Invs gene in mice with an inversion of embryonic turning (inv/inv) and the INVS (NPHP2) gene in human infantile nephronophthisis (NPH). NPH is one of the most important kidney disorders which can cause ESRD in children and young adults. NPHP2 maps to chromosome 9q21-q22 and recent studies have suggested that NPHP2 is associated with INVS. Several mutated alleles in INVS were identified in patients with infantile NPH. Some individuals exhibited extrarenal anomalies such as situs inversus, cardiac ventricular septal defect, and arterial hypertension. Infantile NPH shows marked cyst formation in contrast to other forms of NPH, and rapidly progresses to end-stage renal failure (ESRD) before 5 years of age. Method: In this report, we describe an adolescent with a mutation in INVS who had preservation of his renal function beyond infancy. The patient showed findings of NPH with mild renal insufficiency together with situs inversus. He also exhibited a series of features consistent with Jeune syndrome involving asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, heart failure, and hypertension prior to advanced renal insufficiency. NPH also has been associated with Jeune syndrome. Based upon these features, our patient is likely to have the combined clinical features of infantile NPH with Jeune syndrome. Result: Genetic analysis for INVS disclosed a heterozygous mutation of T\u2192G at position rs7024375 in the 5'UTR of INVS in the patient and his mother, while no abnormalities were found in any of the 17 exons of INVS or NPHP1, 3, and 4. This substitution in 5'UTR of INVS might influence the stability of INVS mRNA, which could compromise inversin protein transcription. The instability of inversin protein synthesis due to this heterozygous mutation may be responsible for the slowly progressive course of renal insufficiency in our patient. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first patient possessing a genetic alteration in INVS who had preservation of renal function past childhood. This study may suggest that our patient is a compound heterozygote for infantile NPH and Jeune syndrome, and is presumably a novel clinical variant of infantile NPH.",

(3) Introduction: Heparin-binding EGF like growth factor (HB-EGF) is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor and is capable of activating EGF receptors in a juxtacrine manner. As epithelial cells attach and spread, they may make contact with neighboring cells, and focal complex processes including lamellipodia are considered premature cell-cell contact sites. In MDCK cells, stable expression of a non-cleavable and membrane-anchored human HB-EGF construct (MDCKH5AA cells) resulted in enhanced cell spreading and formation of significantly extended lamellipodia and filopodia compared to wild type (WT) cells. There was increased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK in the MDCKH5AA cells compared to the control cells, while Src tyrosine phosphorylation was not different between the two cell lines. In addition, there was a marked increase in phosphorylation of Akt in MDCKH5AA cells compared to the control cells whereas ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was no different between the two cell lines.Membrane-anchored HB-EGF associates with glycoproteins and ECM through its proximal (heparin binding) domain and with the tetraspanin, CD9 through its EGF-like domain. Chimeric proteins with substitution of either the TGF-a proximal domain, which has no heparin-binding capability, or EGFs receptor binding domain, which does not interact with CD9, both decreased the level of cell spreading, although the soluble, cleaved form of both of these constructs retained full capacity to activate EGFR. Taken together, our findings suggest that membrane-associated HB-EGF enhances cell spreading and cell-cell adhesion by juxtacrine activation of EGFR. During spreading, optimal interaction of HB-EGF with EGFR may require the participation of other accessory proteins. Method: In MDCK cells, stable expression of a non-cleavable and membrane-anchored human HB-EGF construct (MDCKH5AA cells) resulted in enhanced cell spreading and formation of significantly extended lamellipodia and filopodia compared to wild type (WT) cells. Result: There was increased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK in the MDCKH5AA cells compared to the control cells, while Src tyrosine phosphorylation was not different between the two cell lines. In addition, there was a marked increase in phosphorylation of Akt in MDCKH5AA cells compared to the control cells whereas ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was no different between the two cell lines. Time-lapse video showed that the formation of the long lamellipodia and filopodia in MDCKH5AA cells was a late event (at least 3 hours post-plating) and was more prominent with increasing cell density. Cells expressing a non-cleavable HB-EGF construct mutated to prevent EGFR activation (MDCKH5aa cells) had no change in cell spreading compared to WT, suggesting a necessary role for EGFR activation. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that membrane-associated HB-EGF enhances cell spreading and cell-cell adhesion by juxtacrine activation of EGFR. During spreading, optimal interaction of HB-EGF with EGFR may require the participation of other accessory proteins. Introduction: Alport syndrome is a hereditary glomerulonephritis caused by primary glomerular basement membrane deficiency. Proteinuria is an important risk factor for the disease progression, but the mechanism is still on debate. The slit diaphragm which plays key role in other proteinuric renal disease also changes in Alport syndrome patients with proteinuria, however, the roles of the slit diaphragm is not clear. This study aimed to disclose the association between the slit diaphragm and proteinuria in Alport syndrome. Method: Twenty one Alport syndrome children were studied with age of 2 to 17 years old and the proteinuria duration ranged from 20 days to 11 years. According to the degree of 24 hrs urinary protein (UP), the patients were divided into mild group (UP <30 mg/kg), moderate group(UP 30~50 mg/kg) and heavy group (UP>50 mg/kg). The podocyte foot process width (FPW) was assessed by morphometric analysis. The relationship between FPW and UP was analyzed. By immunoperoxidase staining on paraffin embedded renal sections, slit diaphragm molecules nephrin, podocin and actin associated protein synaptopodin were studied. Result: The FPW correlated with UP significantly(r=0.765, P<0.01). The FPW of the mild group was significantly narrower than that of heavy group (551+174 nm vs. 1513+776 nm, P<0.05). Unexpectedly, two patients with heavy proteinuria did not show obvious foot process effacement, their durations of proteinuria were relative short (1 year). The staining of nephrin and podocin changed both in heavy proteinuria patients with and without foot process effacement, but synaptopodin preserved in the latter. Conclusion: The extent of slit diaphragm disappearance reflected by FPW associated with proteinuria in Alport syndrome. Slit diaphragm molecules nephrin and podocin were involved in the mechanism of heavy proteinuria irrespectively of foot process effacement.

Clinically May-Hegglin anomaly is further divided into several clinical subgroups, one of which is Epstein syndrome. In Epstein syndrome, progressive renal insufficiency and sensorinuronal deafness are present. Recently, the gene encoding for type A myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) was identified as a responsible gene for MHA. In this paper, we describe the genetic and clinical analyses of two patients with Epstein syndrome. Result: Case 1 was diagnosis as having MHA in infancy by thrombocytopenia and large size of platelet. Proteinuria gradually developed after school age, and had been treated with ACEI and ARB. He developed ESRD at 17. Genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous R702C mutation in MYH9 gene. Case 2 is a 3-year-old girl. Thrombocytopenia was noticed during neonatal period and she was referred to our hospital. MHA was suspected because of large size of platelet and inclusion bodies in WBC. Genetic analysis revealed heterozygote R702C mutation in MYH9 gene. Proteinuria was apparent as early as 2 years and 8 months, and now is treated with ARB.",

The fact that proteinuria is dominant in Epstein syndrome might be explained by the fact that type A myosin heavy chain is expressed mainly in podocytes and endothelial cells, while hematuria is cardinal abnormality in Alport syndrome, which is cased by structural changes of GBM. This study also indicates that R702 mutation in MYH9 is a hot spot causing Epstein syndrome.",

Its features vary in ethnic groups. Aim: We examined 3 unrelated Indian families with an index patient with Dent's disease for CLCN5 mutations. Method: After approval from the Ethics Committee and parental consent, EDTA and urine samples were collected from families of patients presenting with Dent's disease. Total urine protein was measured using VITROS microslide technology (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). For detection and characterization of proteins from urine, samples were run by SDS-PAGE on a SEBIA Hydragel 5 kit. Low molecular weight proteins were measured by immunonephelometry. Leukocyte DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers directed to all 12 exons of the CLCN5 gene, followed by automated sequencing. DNA samples from 50 unrelated healthy subjects served as controls. Result: Three boys, with age of onset between 1-2 yr (present age 4yr, 19-yr and 21-yr) were studied. All presented with failure to thrive, polyuria, polydipsia, salt craving and refractory rickets. All had recurrent episodes of night blindness, responsive to vitamin A therapy. There was no family history of similar disease. Investigations showed hypophosphatemic rickets, low molecular weight proteinuria and hypercalciuria (12-20 mg/kg/day). They had no evidence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, renal dysfunction, aminoaciduria or glucosuria. Genetic evaluation showed M504K, W58C and L729X mutations on CLCN5 gene respectively. Their mothers were carriers in all cases. Conclusion: We report novel mutations of the CLCN5 gene in three patients presenting with polyuria, polydipsia, refractory rickets, hypercalciuria, low molecular weight proteinuria and recurrent night blindness in early childhood, in the absence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Our findings expand the spectrum of features reported with Dent's disease. Introduction: Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common pediatric disease that may lead to reflux nephropathy and end-stage renal disease in some patients. Current knowledge indicates that the evolution of VUR is not equal in all patients. It suggested the influence of various factors including genetics. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of the Type 2 Angiotensin II Receptor (AT2R) gene polymorphism with the development and severity of primary VUR. Method: We studied the AT2R gene polymorphisms A190G for association with development of primary VUR and disease severity in 111 VUR children and 60 healthy controls. Sixty of the 111 VUR patients had low-grade VUR (grade I-III) and 51 had high-grade VUR (grade IVand V). To analyze the polymorphisms in the A190G of AT2R gene, the SNP genotyping assay were performed. The genotypic frequency and allele frequency were analyzed to detect the correlation between the patients with mild, severe VUR, and healthy control. Result: We found that the A190G of AT2R gene was associated with the development of VUR in both male and female patients. Significantly higher G and lower A allele frequencies were presented in male VUR patients (G allele 0.39 and A allele 0.61) compared with control (G allele 0.30 and A allele 0.70, p=0.011). The AG genotype was higher in female VUR patients compared with controls (P=0.005).There is no association with the severity of VUR in both male and female patients. Conclusion: AT2R A190G gene polymorphism was associated with the development of the VUR in both male and female patients. There is no association with the severity of VUR in Taiwanese children. It raises the possibility to utilize the genotype of AT2R as a risk factor to evaluate the development of primary VUR. Introduction: Some evidences prove angiotensin II can lead to podocyte injury, and Ang IIcan affect slit diaphragm complex molecules. Transient receptor potential protein 6 (TRPC6) is a nonselective cation channel, which represents a component of the glomerular slit diaphragm. AngII can enhance Ca2+ entry via mutant TRPC6. These studies explore whether TRPC6 is involved in podocyte injury induced by AngII. Method: Mouse podocyte clone (kindly provided by Prof. Peter Mundel) was cultured at 33\u00b0C for proliferation and at 37\u00b0C for differentiation. After treatment with angiotensinII(10-7M) for 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, the protein expression of TRPC6 and other SD molecules were detected by western blotting. Podocyte apoptosis was analyzed with Annexin V-FITC and PI staining by flow cytometry. Cells were loaded with Fluo-3am calcium indicator and stimulated by OAG plus 2 mM Ca2+. The alteration of intracellurla Ca2+ was detected by using FLX 800 spectrophotofluorometer. To verify the role of TRPC6 in these alteration induced by AngII, TRPC6 siRNA was transfected according to the standard protocol. Result: After treatment with AngII, the protein expression of TRPC6 was increased at 72 h, while the podocin protein was degreased at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Other SD molecular expressions (nephrin, -actinin-4, and CD2AP) didn't change. The percentage of apoptotic podocytes was significantly increased at 48 h and 72 h. After transfection with TRPC6 siRNA in AngII-treated podocytes, the apoptosis was decreased, but, it was higher than that of control group. The intracellular Ca2+ was increased in podocytes treated with AngII for 72 h. After transfection with TRPC6 siRNA, The increased influx of Ca2+ was lower than that of AngII-treated group. Conclusion: AngII can increase the protein expression of TRPC6 and decrease that of podocin. TRPC6 is involved in AngII-induced podocyte apoptosis, in part. The increased influx of Ca2+ in podocytes is a component of podocyte injury, mediated by TRPC6 channels. Introduction: Heparin-binding EGF like growth factor (HB-EGF) is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor and is capable of activating EGF receptors in a juxtacrine manner, which associated with cell survival and epithelial integrity. As epithelial cells attach and spread, they may make contact with neighboring cells, and focal complex processes including lamellipodia are considered premature cell-cell contact sites. Method: We constructed MDCK II (wild type) cells stably expressing a non-cleavable and membrane-anchored human HB-EGF (H5AA cells) and H5AA cells mutated to prevent EGFR activation (mH5AA cells). Using these cells, we evaluated morphological differences and expression of foxal adhesion complex in western blot analysis. Result: H5AA cells resulted in enhanced cell spreading and extension of lamellipodia compared to wild type (WT) cells. Western blot analysis shows there was increased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK in the H5AA cells compared to WT cells, while Src tyrosine phosphorylation was not different between the two cell lines. In addition, mH5AA cells had no change in cell spreading compared to WT. Conclusion: The membrane-associated HB-EGF enhances cell spreading and cell-cell adhesion by juxtacrine activation of EGFR. During spreading, optimal interaction of HB-EGF with EGFR may require the participation of other accessory proteins. Introduction: Hypertension is relatively uncommon in the pediatric age group affecting less than 5% of children. Severe hypertension is usually due to a secondary cause. The likelihood of identifying a cause is inversely related to the age of the patient and directly related to the degree of elevation of blood pressure. We report here two adolescents with severe hypertension and hyper-renin secretion in whom two rare remediable causes were found. Method: Case 1: An 11 year old presented with severe headaches and was found to have severe hypertension requiring 3 anti-hypertensive medications. Her father was also known to have hypertension from the age of 30 years and a cause for this was not found. Our patient manifested persistent hypokalaemia (serum K 3.1-3.5 mmol/L) and high plasma renin levels. Further investigation led to the diagnosis of a reninoma. Following resection, she has mild hypertension (3 months post-surgery) and is controlled on monotherapy. Case 2: A 7 year old boy being treated with potassium supplements for hypokalaemic periodic paralysis developed hypertension 7 years later. The blood pressure required two antihypertensives for control. There was no family history of hypertension. Evaluation revealed hyper-renin hyperaldosteronism. A long drawn out search for a renovascular cause then ensued and revealed a dual supply to the right kidney with a long aberrant supply from the bifurcation of the aorta to the lower pole. The patient refused surgical intervention and is currently aged 19 years and on 2 antihypertensive drugs Result: Conclusion: Although essential hypertension is increasingly recognized in the adolescent age group, the young age of a patient and severe elevations of blood pressure should trigger the search for an identifiable and potentially treatable cause for this condition which has potentially high risk of morbidity and mortality. Introduction: Renal vascular hypertension (RVH) is a common secondary hypertension in children, earlier intervention can improve the prognosis. We analyzed 13 children with RVH in our department aimed to find their characteristics. Method: Thirteen children diagnosed with RVH during 2000-2008 were included. The data including etiology, onset symptom, the injury of renal, renal arterial, heart, eye ground and brain, plasma renin and serum potassium level, and treatment were analyzed. Result: There were 8 boys and 5 girls aged from 8 months to 15 years old. The mean blood pressure was 173/125mmHg. Seven children had Takayasu arteritis, 1 neurofibromatosis, 1 after surgery of tumor, 1 ectopic kidney, 1 renal dysplasia, 1 fibromuscular dysplasia and 1 foreign body in renal arterial. Four children presented with headache, vomiting and convulsion, 4 with polyuria and/or foamy urine and/or edema, 4 with palpitation, and 2 no symptoms. Proteinuria occurred in 80% and alleviated with the normalization of hypertension, most of them were selective proteinuria. Eight children had heart injury, 3 had eye ground involvement. Plasma renin increased in 80% children. High plasma renin with hypokalemia occurred in 45%. Eight patients were diagnosed by renal angiography, 5 by ultrasonography, or computerized tomographic angiography or magnetic resonance angiography. The positive rate of renal vascular Doppler ultrasonography was 67%. The bilateral renal length difference exceeded 1.5 cm in 72% children. Bilateral renal vascular stenosis occurred in 4 children, and single in 9. Eleven children received at least 2 kinds of drugs, 7 undergone renal angioplasty or nephrectomy due to poor effect to drugs. Conclusion: Takayasu arteritis is the most common etiology revealed by this study. There was a higher ratio of involvement on heart, brain, and kidney. Renal arterial Doppler ultrasonography, the renal size difference exceeds 1.5 cm, higher plasma renin with hypokalemia will support the diagnosis of RVH. Introduction: Renal vascular hypertension (RVH) caused by foreign body in renal arterial is rare. The classical disease history from the onset to the nephrectomy of a boy with RVH due to foreign body in renal arterial was studied. Method: The clinical data were analyzed to find the characteristics. Result: A 10 years old boy was enrolled in our hospital because of high blood pressure averaged 150/100 mmHg for 3 month, he did not respond to calcium channel blocker combined with beta receptor blocker, no headache, vomiting and convulsion complained. Four month before the onset, he underwent an operation on brain tumor. There is no family history of hypertension. No specific signs were found on physical examination. No involvement of heart and eye ground was found. Laboratory examination found normal urine analysis, clearance rate of creatinine of 57.5 ml/min.1.73 m2. A small sized right kidney of 5.6\u00d71.8\u00d72.0 cm and a normal left kidney of 9.4\u00d73.7\u00d73.6 cm were revealed by ultrasound. By DTPA scan, the GFR was 66 ml/min and 0 ml/min for left and right respectively. Renal angiography showed a 50% stenosis and a tube shaped foreign body in right renal arterial. Four months after onset, he underwent operation for removing the foreign body from the renal arterial, the hypertension could be controlled with calcium channel blocker, 22 months after the operation, the filtration function of left kidney was damaged, he underwent nephrectomy and the blood pressure normalized. Ischemic renal injury was revealed by renal pathology examination. Conclusion: It is a rare RVH case caused by foreign body in renal arterial. The prominent finding is the seriously damaged renal function. No presentation was complained, and no heart and eye involvement. For kidney without filtration function, nephrectomy was the best choice to prevent the damage to another kidney. Introduction: It is well known that antibiotics resistance in the microorganism of increased in the adult patients of UTI. However, there are few reports of antibiotics resistance in the childhood patients. We performed a prospective study for the antibiotics responsiveness of childhood patients who have febrile UTI. Method: A total 110 febrile UTI patients who admitted in the department of pediatrics of Cheongju St. Mary's Hospital from April 2007 to January 2008 were investigated. All the patients had suspicious UTI because of fever higher than 380C and leukocyturia >5/HPF. UTI was confirmed by overgrowth of single strain organism at least 1\u00d7105 colony forming unit/mL in the cultured urine. The patients were divided into two groups according to antibiotics used (group A (N=60): ampicillin-sulbactam + tobramycin vs. group B (N=50): cefotaxime). Mean febrile days, needs to change antibiotics, and other laboratory data were evaluated. If fever was persisted until the 3rd day after initial antibiotics started, it was changed to another one. Result: There were no significant differences in age, sex and mean febrile days before admission. The pathogenic bacteria grown in urine culture were not different between two groups. The incidence of antibiotics failure which means persisted fever until the 3rd day of the initial antibiotics was significantly higher in the group A than in the group B (35% vs. 6%, p=0.004). The mean febrile days after initial antibiotics treatment were longer in the group A compare to the group B (2.2 days vs. 1.8 days, p=0.01). Other laboratory findings and the defects in DMSA scan were not different between two groups. Conclusion: In this study, we showed the 3rd generation cephalosporine is superior to the conventional ampicillin-sulbactam + aminoglycoside in the treatment of childhood UTI patients. Introduction: Urinary tract infections are common clinical problems occurring in infants and pediatric patient groups, most frequently caused by uropathogenic E. coli. Breast feeding has known to have protective effect to urinary tract infection, so many clinicians encourage mothers to breastfeed. It has also known that probiotics have protective effect against urianry tract infection. In this study, we examined the synergistic effect of breast feeding and probiotics in breastfed infants. Method: Double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of 60 motherinfant pairs was performed. The probiotics and control(placebo) groups are statistically no difference in characteristics of infants and mothers. No statistical difference in total breast feeding period in both groups. Mothers of both groups were administered probiotics or placebo and the urines of infants were taken every month. All infants had no urinary tract infection at all in the initiation time.",

            "text": "Result: In probiotics group, urinary tract pathogens were detected in three infants, but in placebo group, urinary tract pathogens were detected in eight infants. The risk of developing urinary tract infection during the first 1 year of life in infants whose mothers received probiotics was reduced in comparison with that in infants whose mothers received placebo(10% and 26.7%, respectively). Conclusion: Administering probiotics during breast-feeding offers a safe and effective mode of promoting the immunoprotective potential of breast-feeding and provides protection against urinary tract infection during the first 1 year of life. Result: 392 patients with UTI were enrolled in this study whose mean age was 2.43+/-3.10 years (range 1 month-14 years). The mean period before treatment was 2.27+/-7.52 months (range 0.03-72 months). In all of the patients, 162 children were proved to have VUR by MCU, in which 150 patients were primary VUR. There were 83 males and 67 females in the group, the ratio of male: female was 1.23: 1. All patients were divided into two groups (VUR and no VUR). There were significant difference in acute DMSA, renal scar and urine microproteinuria between two groups (P<0.05). In our study the incidence of primary VUR in all patients with UTI was 41.33% (150/392). 93 patients(62%) of all patients with VUR were younger than 2 years old, and 39 patients (26%) were 2-7 years old, 18 patients (12%) were older than 7 years. Conclusion: The UTI patients with abnormal results in DMSA (acute DMSA and renal scar) and urine microproteinuria should be given more attention. Boys who were younger than two years old have more possibility of suffering VUR. We should choice the optimum time for patients with UTI undergoing MCU, early diagnosis and treatment are clinically significant. DMSA, microproteinuria, age and gender are useful markers to identify those patients at high risk for VUR. Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most frequent infectious diseases in children, with an increasing resistance to antimicrobials. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the spectrum of microbial etiology and the factors that may impact on the results of urine culture; (2) to determine the change in antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens isolates from children with communityacquired UTIs and the clinical outcomes of patients with an isolate resistant to the antibiotic received. Method: In this prospective study over a period of 20 years (1987.1~2006.12), we enrolled 514 pediatric inpatients whose discharged diagnosis were community-acquired UTIs and urine samples had been cultured for bacteria when hospitalized. The histories, including the medications before the urine samples were collected, the results of urine culture and the therapeutic effect were analyzed. Result: (1)514 urine samples of which 259 (50.4%) grew bacterial isolates were analyzed. Among the total of 259 isolates, most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 63.7% of isolates, followed by Enterococcus faecalis (16.6%), bacillus proteus(6.6%). Other bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus accounted 13.1% in total.",

            "text": "Result: This pictorial exhibit shows the potential of MR urography in the anatomic evaluation of the urinary tract, hydronephrosis, obstructive uropathy, congenital malformations, pyelonephritis and renal scarring. MR urography was particularly useful in children because it does not use ionizing radiation. MR imaging has inherently greater soft-tissue contrast than other imaging techniques. When used in conjunction with dynamic scanning after administration of a contrast agent, it provided non-invasive analysis of the perfusion, concentration and excretion of each kidney. Conclusion: MR urography allows a reliable assessment of renal and ureteral anatomy and of dysplastic or ectopic renal buds, even in non-or poorly functioning systems. MR urography therefore has the potential to replace the currently used excretory urography and scintigraphy. Introduction: Acute Renal Failure (ARP) in children is very common and associated seizure is responsible for fatal outcome. This study was conducted in the Pediatric Nephrology unit of Dhaka, Shishu (children) Hospital over a period of one year. Method: In this study 35 children with convulsion positive ARF were compared with similar number of convulsion negative ARF children. Result: Age of convulsion positive children were significantly lower compared to convulsion negative group (24\u00b137 Vs 43\u00b141 mo.). Incidence of fever, unconsciousness and septicemia were higher in convulsion positive group. Duration of ARF before referral was also much higher among convulsion positive group. Aetiologically Haemolytic Uremic syndrome and septicemia were the major causes of ARF in convulsion positive group while ARF following diarrhoea was the major cause in convulsion negative group. Hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, pyogenic meningitis & leucocytosis were the significantly important risk factors of convulsion. Significantly higher number of patient died due to ARF in convulsion positive group. Outcome of neonatal age group is worst & those who survived developed neurological sequelae. Conclusion: Convulsion in ARF patient is more common in lower age group. Metabolic abnormalities & infections are the major cause of seizure. Mortality is higher in convulsion positive ARF. It appears that early referral & early treatment will reduce the mortality. Introduction: Hyperphosphatemia is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality risk in patients with chronic kidney disease. The relative effectiveness and safety of sevelamer, a mineral-free phosphate binder, for treatment of hyperphosphatemia in children with chronic kidney disease is uncertain. This study was designed to compare the efficacy and acceptability of sevelamer hydrochloride with calcium acetate as a phosphate binder in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease. Method: A 12-week open-label trial of sevelamer hydrochloride vs. calcium acetate was initiated in 22 patients, aged 2 to 18 years, with CKD stages III and IV. Dietary phosphate and calcium intake were assessed and baseline serum calcium, phosphate and PTH levels recorded. After a 2-week washout of phosphate binders and vitamin D, patients were randomized to receive sevelamer hydrochloride or calcium acetate. Result: Serum phosphate decreased from 6.6 mg/dl to 5.8 mg/dl at 12-weeks in the calcium acetate group (P 0.7) and 6.2 mg/dl to 6.0 mg/dl in the sevelamer group (P 0.2). Serum calcium changed from 8.4 mg/dl to 8.5 mg/dl at 12-weeks in the calcium acetate group (P 0.2) and 9.4 mg/dl to 8.6 mg/dl in the sevelamer group (P 0.8). The serum calcium x phosphate product was not significantly different between the two groups at baseline as well as at 3-months (49.4 mg2/ dl2 and 51.8 mg2/dl2 in the calcium acetate and sevelamer groups respectively (P 0.7). After adjusting baseline biochemical parameters in the two groups using ANCOVA, the serum phosphate at 12 weeks in either group did not change significantly {Calcium acetate group (Normal mean; Adjusted mean) (5.88; 5.30) , Sevelamer group (6.07; 6.18) [P (adjusted means) 0.57]}, however, the serum calcium at 12 weeks was altered significantly{Calcium acetate group (Normal mean; Adjusted mean) (8.43; 9.21) , Sevelamer group (9.34; 8.21) There was no significant difference between the PTH levels of the two groups at baseline or at 3-months. In the sevelamer group there was a non-significant decrease in serum bicarbonate whereas the total and LDL cholesterol significantly decreased at 12-weeks (P 0.04). Sevelamer hydrochloride was well tolerated and without adverse effects related to the drug. Conclusion: Compared with calcium-based phosphate binders, use of sevelamer in patients with chronic kidney disease is associated with similar to slightly higher phosphate levels, similar calcium phosphate product, reduction in serum calcium levels and a significant improvement in levels of total and LDL cholesterol.

            "text": "Introduction: To find the underlying disease of persistent rickets in a boy. Method: Analysis of the presentation and laboratory investigations. Result: A 13 years old boy was admitted because of X shaped legs accompanied by growth stunting for 6 years. The height was 141 cm. No anemia, hypertension or leukocyturia were revealed. The serum calcium was slightly decreased to 2.06 mmol/l, the phosphate decreased to 0.7 mmol/l. The urinary phosphate was normal. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased to 1449 U/l, while PTH was normal. Both proximal and distal renal tubule functions were compromised. X ray of wrist showed fraying and widening of the metaphysis, extensive cupping of the distal ends of the radius and ulna. Small sized kidneys, dilated ureters and pelves were revealed by MRI. Grade V vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was found by micturating cystourogram examination. DTPA scan revealed GFR of 10 ml/min of both kidneys. By DMSA scan, renal scar was found on the right kidney, while the left kidney was small. No abnormality was revealed in the spinal cord on MRI. Urinary dynamic analysis showed normal function of the bladder. He was diagnosed as rickets, chronic renal failure (uremic stage), VUR (primary), and reflux nephropathy. Some uncommon points existed: 1. persistent rickets was pronounced, the reason was not very clear. Hypophosphatemia and normal serum PTH were uncommon in renal osteodystrophy; there were no risk factors for adynamic bone lesion, such as dialysis or diabetes mellitus. Normal urinary phosphate and chronic renal failure did not support familial hypophosphatemic rickets. The compromised renal tubules caused by reflux nephropathy might be the main cause. 2. Chronic renal failure without anemia and hypertension. 3. VUR without evidence of UTI. Introduction: Search of markers of progressing of chronic diseases of kidneys is an actual problem. N-acetyl-beta -D-glucosaminidase (NAG) is a high molecular-weight lysosomal enzyme found in many tissues of the body. This enzyme shows high activity in renal proximal tubular cells, and leaks into the tubular fluid as the ultrafiltrate passes through proximal tubules. Method: The purpose -to study level of activity urinary NAG in depending from duration of kidneys illness. We followed 26 patients (16 males, 10 females, range in age from 3 to 16 years old) with chronic pyelonephritis. Duration of disease was from 1 till 15 years. The control group has been presented by 38 healthy children same age. Each test of urine has been investigated twice (urine \u0440\u041d -7,4 and 5,5) with spectrophotometer. Result: Level of activity urinary NAG at healthy children 0,805\u00b10,05 su/ml or 1,089\u00b10,243 su/ml /gr Cr. Patients with inflammatory process of a various activity degree had different parameters of activity urinary NAG. Values have made accordingly from 0,687 to 2,992 su/ml., mean -1,462\u00b10,162 or 1,851+0,23 su/ml /gr Cr, \u0440< 0,001 in comparison with parameters of control group. Strong decrease of investigated enzyme parameters at 4 patients with a severe kidney pathology (congenital -2 patients) and scars (0,196, 0,236, 0,223, 0, 233 su/ml, age -7,11, 14, 15 years) was revealed. Positive strong correlation is established with urinary albumin excretion(UAE), R=0,88, p -0, 00004. It has allowed to assume obtained data as a reflection of proximal tubular cell necrosis. Conclusion: Activity urinary NAG, impairment NAG/UAE are a sensitive markers of progressing CRD and nephrosclerosis. Introduction: We report a 4-year-old boy who presented to us as hypertensive encephalopathy and acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Renal biopsy diagnosed Burkitt's lymphoma, which is rare in presenting as acute renal failure Case report: A 4-year-old boy complained of fever without localizing sign for 1 week. He had abdominal pain and vomiting for 3 days, and noticed a gradual decreased in urine output. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 135/92 mmHg, pallor, periorbital and ankle edema. Both kidneys were enlarged and palpable down to the lower quadrates of abdomen. Blood test showed haemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, serum creatinine 312 \u03bcmol/L, urea 11.8 mmol/L, hyperuricemia (1.14 mmol/L). Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 10 ml/min/1.73 m2. CT brain showed hypodense area involving grey-white matter in the left occipital and the left higher parietal region. Hypertension was controlled with labetalol infusion. Continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was commenced. Computerised tomography of abdomen showed bilateral enlarged kidneys of 13cm in length with loss of corticomedullary differentiation and poor renal perfusion, the pancreas was diffusely enlarged and there was focal bony destruction of right ilium. Renal biopsy showed that the renal cortex was diffusely infiltrated by medium size lymphoid cells with coarse chromatin, with active mitosis and karyorrhexis. The tumor cells are CD 3-, CD 20+, CD10+, Tdt-and bcl-2. Ki-67 index is 100%. The glomeruli and tubules were widely spaced out and normal looking. The diagnosis was Burkitt's lymphoma. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed the presence of lymphoma cell. Chemotherapy of protocol HK-NHL98 including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone and intrathecal methotrexate, hydrocortisone, cytarabine was started. CVVHDF could be withdrawn at Day 7 after commencement of chemotherapy. The renal function improved with serum Cr 78 \u03bcmo/L and CrCl of 42 ml/ min/1.73 m2 at Day 10. Follow up computerized tomography of abdomen at Day 20 showed decrease in size of both kidneys and pancreas, and improvement in renal perfusion. Discussion: Burkitt's lymphoma is a rare cause as initial presentation with acute renal failure, though acute renal failure is more commonly seen during treatment of malignancy or when there were complications like sepsis. With prompt diagnosis and commencement of therapy, the tumour regressed with significant shrinkage in the kidney sizes and normalization of renal function. Introduction: Although pediatric liver recipients face the risk of chronic renal failure as a result of the nephrotoxicity of the commonly used immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine (CyA) and tacrolimus, there are few reports that describe the incidence and progression of renal failure. We aimed to assess the incidence of renal failure in our hospital. Method: We identified 16 patients (4 males, 12 females) who received liver transplants because of biliary atresia between 1988 and 2007. We examined their renal function, the term of using immunosuppressive drugs, and the blood concentration of CyA and tacrolimus by clinical records retrospectively. Result: As of December 2007, 15 patients used tacrolimus, and one patient used CyA. The ages of the patients were 5.9\u00b15.9 years (range, 2 to 20 years). The follow-up time after using immunosuppressive drugs was 3.2\u00b1 5.4 years (range, 1 to 19 years). The blood concentration of tacrolimus was 3.0\u00b12.3 ng/ml (range, 0.5 to 6.3 ng/ ml). There were no patients with hypertension. However there were two patients with renal dysfunction. One was treated with tacrolimus, and the other was treated with CyA. One patient with tacrolimus had proteinuria and hematuria. Renal biopsy showed IgA nephropathy combined with tublointerstitial lesions and hyalinizing of arterioles. We thought that using tacrolimus may cause those complications for IgA nephropathy. The other patient with CyA had proteinuria and relatively high blood trough levels of CyA (130 ng/ml).After reducing the dose, she recovered her renal function and proteinuria vanished. Conclusion: Both of the patients with renal dysfunction have used immunosuppressive drugs for more than 15 years. The majority of other patients have used them for less than 5 years. Therefore we think that some of them will progress to renal failure in the future. We are going to follow-up having found early renal dysfunction. Introduction: Background: Acute renal failure (ARF) is characterized by an abrupt and sustained decline on glomerular filtration rate. The process is multifactorial involving alteration of haemodynamics, specific nephronal susceptibilities, intratubular obstruction and cellular metabolic fluxes. Objective: The aim of the study was to describe the characteristics of children with acute renal failure. Method: Methods: A retrospective and descriptive study was conducted on 60 children with ARF from January 2000 to April 2008 in Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya-Indonesia. The characteristics of the patients included age, sex, aetiology and outcome were recorded. Result: Results: A total of 60 children with acute renal failure were included, consisted of 40 boys (66.7%) and 20 girls (33.3%), with median age of 8.5 years (mean age 7.1\u00b14.3 years). The aetiology of ARF was mainly renal disorders in 50 (83.8%) cases then followed by prerenal in 8 (13.3%) and post renal disorders in 2 (3.3%) cases. Glomerulonephritis was the major cause (58%) of ARF, followed by septicemia (16%), bilateral hydronephrosis (10%), and others (16% Introduction: This study is a prospective, case study with the aim of assessing the epidemiology and the clinical features of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) in the children hospital 1, HCM city, Vietnam",

Introduction: Acute renal failure (ARF) is a life-threatening complication in critical ill pediatric patients. Recently, renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality has shifted from peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).The objectives were to review etiology, treatment modalities and outcomes of children with ARF requiring RRT, and also to identify the risk factors of mortality. Method: The medical records of 36 children diagnosed with ARF requiring RRT who were admitted between March 2004 and February 2008, were reviewed. Result: The median age at diagnosis of ARF was 4.2 years. Eighteen were males. The main causes of ARF were hypoxic/ischemia ATN (47%) and multifactor (25%). The initiated modalities of RRT were PD 64%, HD 17% and CVVH 19%, respectively. Unfortunately, 4 cases initiated with PD received inadequate treatment which must be changed or combined with other modalities. The median duration of RRT was 7.5 days (interquatile range 3-17 days). The mortality rate at 30 days after the treatment was 64%. Multivariate analysis revealed that sepsis (p=0.033, HR 8.94, ) and duration of RRT less than 5 days (p=0.019, HR 4.27, 95% CI 1.27-14.39) were associated with mortality. According to survival curve, the probability of survival in the first 10, 30 and 60 days after the initiation of RRT was 72, 44 and 30%, respectively. The renal statuses of 11 survivors at day 90 were completely recovery of 54.5%, chronic renal insufficiency of 27.3% and dialysis dependence of 18.2%. Conclusion: Despite the increasing use of RRT in the tertiary care hospital, the mortality rate of children with ARF remained high. ARF was a significant co-morbid problem of critically ill patients. Sepsis was the significant risk factor of death. No specific modality was better than others. \u2022Most common electrolyte abnormality observed was reduced copper and zinc level. \u2022Hyponatremia was present in 60% of the patients of which 88.88% were males and 11.12% were females. \u2022Serum calcium was <8.8 in 80% patients, of which 75% were males and 25% females. \u2022Serum phosphate was more for respective age in 40% of the patients, of which 88.88% were males and 11.12% were females. \u2022Electrolyte abnormalities were more common in 6-12 year of age group.

Introduction: The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is helpful in measuring peritoneal permeability in peritoneal dialysis (PD). The data reported by Warady et al. have been used as the global reference in pediatric patients. We evaluated and analyzed the peritoneal transport characteristics of Korean pediatric patients on PD. In addition, we studied the association between genetic polymorphism of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and peritoneal membrane transport. Method: We investigated the data from 32 pediatric patients undergoing PD within 12 months at Seoul National University Children Hospital and Samsung Medical Center. PET was performed by instillation of 1,100\u00b150 mL/m2 body surface area of a 2.5% glucose solution according to a published protocol. Results of PET were compared with the published data. We investigated the influence of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of VEGF (-2578C/A, -14978T/C, -1154G/A, -634G/C, +936C/T) on the peritoneal membrane transport. Result: The mean 4-hour D/PCr and the mean 4-hour D/D0 glucose were 0.56\u00b10.12 and 0.43\u00b10.09, respectively. In comparison to the results published by Warady et al., our patients had higher D/PCr and lower D/D0 glucose. Analysis of VEGF SNP showed the haplotype CTGGC carrier was associated with higher D/P Cr and lower D/D0 glucose. Conclusion: These results suggest that individual race or country may need their own reference values for interpretation of PET. The VEGF SNP may influence the peritoneal membrane transport. Further studies of larger scale are necessary to confirm the results. Introduction: Peritonitis is a serious clinical problem commonly occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) that may require hospitalization, cause damage to peritoneum and death. A variety of etiologic microorganisms may cause CAPD peritonitis, mostly Grampositive organisms. Many different antimicrobial agents, intraperitoneally or intravenously, have been used to treat CAPD peritonitis. The objective of this paper was to study the incidence, etiology and outcomes of peritonitis episodes in children with CAPD. Method: A retrospective and descriptive study was carried out on 15 patients who had been treated by CAPD between 1 March 2003 and 29 February 2008 in Dr.Soetomo Hospital Surabaya Indonesia. Peritonitis diagnosis was based on at least 2 of the following: abdominal pain, cloudy PD effluent, white blood cell (WBC) count in the effluent at least 100/\u03bcL and positive culture of effluent. Result: Mean age at onset of CAPD patients was 8.9\u00b13.5 years, most were boys (73.3%) and only 4 (26.7%) were girls. During the period of 5 years, 9 (60.0%) out of 15 ESRD patients with CAPD remained peritonitis-free. There were 10 episodes of peritonitis among 6 patients in 185 patient-months, which equates to an overall peritonitis rate of 1 episode every 18.5 months (0.6 episodes/year at risk). All patients experienced abdominal pain and had cloudy effluents. Most of dialysat fluid cultures were negative (44.4%) with Staphylococcus coagulase negative as the most frequent microorganism isolated (22.2%) and treated with intraperitoneal Cefazoline, followed by Staphylococcus aureus in 1 patient treated with intravenous Ceftriaxone and yeast cell in 1 patient treated with intraperitoneal Fluconazole. Cure occurred in 70.0% of episodes while death occurred in 30.0% of episodes. Conclusion: Peritonitis rate in our population is acceptable although there are several areas for improvement. Its etiologies and outcomes follow the international descriptions. Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) has been proved successful in the treatment of refractory cardiac or respiratory insufficiency. However, acute renal failure in such patients is frequently encountered and then continuous arterial-venous hemofiltration(CAVH), continuous veno-venous hemofiltration(CVVH) or continuous venoveno hemodialysis(CVVHD) may be beneficial. Due to the experience of cooperation of ECMO with CRRT is limited in Taiwan. We report the frequency of usage, and outcomes in children treated with one unit providing ECMO and CAVH, CVVH or CVVHD. Method: Between February 2007 and December 2007, five critically ill patients(3 male, 2 female), aged from 4 moth to 23 year-old, were treated with ECMO in our pediatric intensive care unit due to the cardiac and/or respiratory failure. All of them were complicated with acute renal injury and/or fluid overload. According to RIFLE classification, they were all classified as RIFLE class F and continuous renal replacement therapy was applied immediately. Of the five patients, three patients, who was diagnosed as ARDS with pulmonary hemorrhage, cardiac temponade and cardiogenic shock respectively, underwent CVVHD. One, who was diagnosed as pneumonia with respiratory failure, underwent CVVH and one, who was diagnosed as dilated cardiomyopathy with left heart failure, underwent both CVVH and CAVHD. Result: The mean duration of CRRT is 6 days(range 2 days to 11 days). The mean blood urea nitrogen before CRRT is 43 mg/dL (range 29 to 63 mg/dL) and the mean serum creatinine before CRRT is 2.54 mg/dL(range 1.3 to 3.8 mg/dL). After CRRT, the mean blood urea nitrogen fell to 21.2 mg/dL (range 5 to 34 mg/dL) and the mean serum creatinine fell to 1.4 mg/dL (range 0.4 to 2.3 mg/dL). Three patients died eventually due to irreversible cardiac and/or respiratory failure and two patients survived(one male, one female). Conclusion: Performing CAVH, CVVH and CVVHD in critical-ill children who underwent ECMO therapy with large age and weight ranges still poses significant clinical and technical challenges. Our experience demonstrates the effectiveness of CRRT in the restoration of renal function during ECMO, but there is still need to define a more practical protocol for cooperation of CRRT with ECMO and to avoid possible complications. Introduction: Few reports describe severe anemia due to Parvovirus B19 (PB19) infection after renal transplantation in children. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is successfully used to treat PB19-related anemia; however, several reports have shown PB19-related anemia can recur despite IVIg therapy. Method: We studied a case of PB19 infection in a renal transplantation child from our center. Result: A 16-year-old boy with ESRD due to IgA nephropathy received a cadaveric renal transplantation. Initial immunosuppression consisted prednisolone, mycophenolate-mofetil, tacrolimus and basiliximab. Seven weeks after transplantation, he experienced acute rejection (Banff grade III), which was successfully treated with high dose steroids, ATG and plasmapheresis. Subsequently, his hemoglobin dropped to 54 g/l and bone marrow biopsy showed hypoplasia of red cells. He was treated with blood transfusion, EPO, Vitamin B12 and folate. However, his hemoglobin ranged from 55 to 65 g/l. Further investigation revealed positive PB19 IgM-antibodies in serum. After therapy with IVIg (0.4 g/kg/d for 4 days) and conversion from mycophenolate-mofetil to rapamycin, anemia resolved. But two months after treatment with IVIg, anemia recurred and PB19 IgMantibodies was still positive in serum. A second course of IVIg (0.2 g/ kg/d for 10 days) was given, which was again followed by the resolution of anemia and recurrence. Subsequently, one course a month of IVIg (0.4 g/kg/d for 5 days) was repeated four times and bigeminal immunosuppressants with low doses including prednisolone and tacrolimus were used. Within the next seven months, anemia did not recur and serum PB19 IgM-antibodies kept negative. Renal function remained stable, with an actual serum creatinine of 93 \u03bcmol/ l (eGFR 108 ml/min/1.73 m2) and no proteinuria. Conclusion: Although rare, PB19 infection should be considered in differential diagnosis of anemia after renal transplantation. IvIg is useful to control PB19-related anemia. Furthermore, baseline immunosuppression should be carefully adjusted to control PB19 infection. Introduction: Endotoxin hemoabsorption therapy with a polymyxin B-immobilized column (PMX-DHP) has been used to treat mostly adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with Gram-negative bacterial infection. The mechanism has been thought to reduce circulating endotoxin. Method: Case report: The patient was a 2-year-old boy and was admitted to our hospital under the diagnosis of septic shock and MOF including acute kidney failure. He had neuroblastoma stage IV with matastases to liver, bone and bone marrow. His pediatric logistic organ dysfunction (PELOD) score was forty-two points, which means his predicted death rate was 99.1%, on admission. The value of endotoxin was within normal range and the level of inflammatory cytokines, endogenous cannabinoides and HMGB-1 were significantly elevated, before PMX-DHP. After admission, he was immediately treated with endotoxin absorption thrapy by PMX column. Significant improvement of hypotension and increase in urine output were observed right after PMX-DHP treatment. The value of inflammatory cytokines, endogenous cannabinoides and HMGB-1 decreased after PMX-DHP treatment, subsequently. Result: Discussion: Several studies have demonstrated that PMX-DHP therapy was effective for septic shock without endotoxemia. On the other hand, the role of paracrine mediators of hypotension such as anandamide (ANA), 2-arachidonyl glyceride (2-AG) and HMGB-1 has been emphasized in recent investigations in septic shock. We successfully treated an infant case of severe septic shock and MOF without endotoxemia, using PMX-DHP. In this case, PMX-DHP was effective in reducing serum levels of the inflammatory cytokines as well as ANA, 2-AG and HMGB-1, which might lead to Significant improvement of hypotension, urine output and the PELOD score. Conclusion: This case report suggests that PMX-DHP is an effective treatment for childhood septic shock and MOF without endotoxemia. The mechanism of PMX-DHP for septic shock seemed to be a reduction of ANA and 2-AG, causative mediators of cytokine storm. Introduction: The purpose of this study is to present our experience of peritoneal dialysis associated peritonitis in Korean children and to propose guidelines for empirical treatment by the recent regional data of organisms and their sensitivity to antibiotics Method: We have collected data on pediatric patients from the Korean Pediatric CRF Registry between January 1, 2007, and April 30, 2008. Result: Of the 108 patients, peritonitis was occurred in 24 patients(32 episodes). The rate of peritonitis was one episode over 41.88 patientmonths. Gram-positive organism accounted for 71.4% of all episodes. Of the gram-positive organism, most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (20%), next common pathogens were coagulase negative Staphylococcus(15%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (15%) and Streptococcus viridans(15%). 85% of the gram-positive pathogens was sensitive to 1st generation cephalosporin(cephalothin). However, in patients younger than 4 years old, 67% of gram-positive pathogens was resistant to 1st generation cephalosporin. Of the gramnegative organism, most common pathogens were Acinetobacter baumanii(28.6%) and Serratia marcescens(28.6%). All of the gramnegative pathogens were sensitive to ceftazidime. 88.5% of all pathogens were sensitive to cephalothin or ceftazidime. The rate of peritonitis was higher in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients(one episode over 35.28 patient-month) than in automated peritoneal dialysis patients(one episode over 50.36 patient-month) (P<0.05). Conclusion: The empirical therapy with 1st generation cephalosporine and ceftazidime can be also effective to peritoneal dialysis associated peritonitis in Korean children. But, in patient younger than 4 years old, glycopeptides(vancomycin or teicoplanin) should be considered as the first empirical therapy in Korean children. Introduction: To investigate the prevalence of hypertension and the blood pressure (BP) pattern in children after renal transplantation using casual blood pressure and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), and to evaluate the control of hypertension in this paediatric population. Method: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study. Patients with functioning renal graft and age less than 20 years old were included. ABPM was done by using a SpaceLabs 90121 oscillometric device during routine yearly assessment. The daytime, night time pattern and day-to-night BP variation were measured. The BP load measured was stratified into 3 grades: <35%; 35-50% and >50%. The mean 24-hour ABPM results are correlated with the casual BP during routine follow-up. Result: A total of 20 patients were included in the study. The male-tofemale ratio was 1:1. The mean age of patients was 15.1+/-4.1 years and ABPM was performed on average 3.4+/-2.1 years after transplantation. The mean GFR by Schwartz estimation was 73.3 ml/min/ 1.73 m2. Overall, 9 patients (45%) had nocturnal hypertension, 16 (80%) lost the nocturnal dip phenomenon and 2 of them had a reversed pattern. Ten patients required anti-hypertensive drugs, and calcium-channel-blocker was most commonly prescribed. One patient had a systolic BP load of 35-50%, four had a diastolic BP load of 35-50% and two had a diastolic BP load of >50%. Despite treatment, 3 patients were still hypertensive by casual BP measurement and all 3 were also shown to be hypertensive by ABPM (PPV: 100%). For those 17 patients with a normal casual BP, 16 of them had a normal ABPM (NPV: 94%). One patient was detected hypertensive by ABPM but was missed by casual BP. Conclusion: Hypertension is prevalent among paediatric patients with renal transplantation. ABPM is useful in detecting hypertension, in particular nocturnal hypertension. More emphasis should be put on control of diastolic blood pressure in this group of patients Introduction: Renal transplantation is the preferred therapy for children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Method: We reviewed the medical records of children with ESRD who received renal transplantation at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, between August 15, 2001 and May 12, 2008. Result: Eight male and seven female patients were identified. The mean age was 12.7\u00b13.2 years (range, 5.0-17.6). The major cause of ESRD was a congenital anomaly of the kidneys (53%). All of the children received cadaveric transplantations and none received induction therapy. Triple immunosuppressive drugs comprising cyclosporine A, prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil were administered to 12 patients. Tacrolimus instead of cyclosporine A was given to three patients who had received a renal transplant since January 2008. The median follow-up time was 13 months (1 to 80 months). The most frequent complication was urinary tract infection (40%). Acute graft loss was found in one patient (6.7%) due to graft infarction. Other complications included herpes viral infection (20%), chronic rejection (20%), acute rejection (13.3%), gum hypertrophy (13.3%), myopathy (6.7%), lymphocele (6.7%) and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (6.7%). Cyclosporine A was changed to tacrolimus in five patients diagnosed with gum hypertrophy (2 patients), chronic rejection (2 patients) and myopathy with chronic rejection (1 patient). Two patients returned to dialysis due to graft infarction and chronic rejection, respectively. Mean serum creatinine at last follow-up of the remaining cases was 1.2\u00b10.5 mg/ dL (0.6-2.3 mg/dL). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the potential for successful outcomes of pediatric renal transplantation in this resource-limited area if complications can be reduced and long-term outcomes improved.",

            "text": "Result: The incidence of PTLD was 9.3% (4 cases) with median onset of 2 years (4.8 months-12 years) post-transplant. Etiology of renal failure in the 4 patients included systemic lupus erythematosus, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, chronic glomerulonephritis and juvenile nephronophthisis. Three patients had received IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies for induction, while 1 had anti-thymocyte globulin. Pre-transplant EBV serological testing of 32 recipients in our cohort showed that 10 (31%) were sero-negative and 8 of these developed positive EBV DNA titres on post-transplant surveillance. Clinical presentation of PTLD included rapidly progressive pneumonitis, gastro-intestinal bleed, sub-mandibular lymphadenopathy and infectious mononucleosis syndrome with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and airway obstruction. Histopathological diagnosis revealed B-cell PTLD in 3 and T-cell-rich Hodgkin-like disease in 1 patient. The 2 patients with relatively severe PTLD had been exposed to immunosuppression including alkylating agents for a mean period of 10.2 years prior to transplant. Treatment consisted of reduced immunosuppression, intravenous immunoglobulin and ganciclovir/acyclovir in all patients. Two patients received rituximab therapy, one received conventional chemotherapy and two were treated with resection of primary PTLD. One patient died shortly after diagnosis secondary to chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 1.5 years, the other 3 patients had normal functioning grafts. Conclusion: Pediatric renal transplant patients who are EBV seronegative pre-transplant are at high risk of PTLD. Post-transplant surveillance for EBV DNA may further assist in identifying high risk patients so that early treatment can be instituted. The role of pretransplant exposure to immunosuppression especially alkylating agents needs to be further defined. Objective: To describe the outcome of kidney transplantation in children Method: We retrospectively reviewed a total of pediatric patients with end stage renal disease who underwent kidney transplantation at Siriraj hospital from May 1996 to April 2008. Results: A total number was 19 patients who were 14 males and 5 females. Mean age at the transplant was 11.2\u00b13.0 (range, 6.7-16.5) years. Mean duration after transplant was 4.3\u00b13.3 (range, 0.1-11.7) years. Of all donors, 5 were cadaveric and 14 were living-related. Greater than 3 HLA mismatches were found in 3 pairs. There were 2 HLA-DR mismatches in 2 pairs and 1 HLA-DR mismatch in 14 pairs. Six pairs had positive CMV serology in donors but negative in recipients. Ten were positive in both donors and recipients. Only 2 patients received induction antibody. A combination of steroid and other two immunosuppressants was used in all patients. Initially, cyclosporin A was given in 13 and tacrolimus in 5 patients. Azathioprine was given in 7 and mycophenolate in 11 patients. 12% developed graft rejection and 17.5% had a glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 during the first year after transplant. Serum creatinine seemed to maintain at a stable level after 2 years of transplant. 5-year patient survival and graft survival rate was 86% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: Our outcomes of renal transplant in children are comparable to those in developed countries. early group was lower than that of relapse and remission groups. The entertainment of remission group was more than that of early and relapse groups. Conclusion: The children with chronic kidney disease had obvious anxious emotion, it was related with introversion, course, treatment and income. The anxious emotion will effect abnormal behavior, treatment and quality of life. We should pay more attention to the psychological conditions of children and their parents. Introduction: Random urine calcium to creatinine (U Ca/Cr) ratio has been used for screening hypercalciuria. Howerver, the U Ca/Cr ratio varies in different ages and in geographic areas. The purpose of this study aims at investigating the U Ca/Cr ratio and the effects of the types of drinking water to the U Ca/Cr ratio among primary school children in a limestone area.",

            "text": "Method: This study was performed on 398 healthy school children of age 7-12 in a limestone area. Random urine samples which were collected from all the children just before lunch hour in April 2008 were analyzed for calcium and creatinine. In a questionnaire, on the same day, the parents and caregivers filled out diet habit, disease history, family income, morning diet, and the type of drinking water of the children in research. As the control group, U Ca/Cr ratio of 350 healthy children in a non-limestone area was detected. Result: The mean value for U Ca/Cr ratio of the limestone group and the control group were 0.09\u00b10.076 and 0.11\u00b10.133, respectively (P< 0.001). The 95th percentile for U Ca/Cr ratio of the limestone group and the control group were 0.25\u00b10.076 and 0.30\u00b10.134, respectively. The U Ca/Cr ratio >0.20 was 9% in the limestone group and 18.9% in the control group(P<0.05). A negative correlation R=-0.15, P=0.002 was observed between age and U Ca/Cr ratio. There was no significant difference in sex. The U Ca/Cr ratio of the limestone group was irrelevant to diet habit, disease history, family income, morning diet, and BMI (B.wt/m2). No significant variations in U Ca/ Cr ratio according to the type of drinking water such as filtered water, ground water and tap water were observed in the samples of the limestone group. Conclusion: The expected value of U Ca/Cr ratio in the limestone area was not significantly high enough to compare with that in the non-limestone area. There were not different U Ca/Cr ratio according to the drinking water types.",

Result: All boys suffered from LN at the average age of 11.2\u00b11.9 years old. The course of disease before diagnosis was 9.3\u00b124.8 months(range from 1 to120 months). 4 cases of them were misdiagnosised for a long time as HSPN, NS or AGN. Among our boys, kidney damage was the first manifestation in ten cases(41.7%), and 2 cases(8.3%) only had LN. 23 cases(95.8%) were accompanied with proteinuria(24 h-Upro eduction ranged from 0.87 g to 16.98 g). 5 of 23 cases(20.8%) had decling renal function. Nephrotic syndrome was the main clinical types (45.8%). Renal biopsies were performed in 19 cases. Class IVLN (57. 9%) was the most frequent pathological findings, and \"full house\" was found in 68.4% of biopsies. All patients were taken by the treatment of steroid and immunosuppressive agents. Sixteen boys obtained clinical remission after average 3.4 months, and the remission rate was 66.7%. Six cases (25%) relapsed during follow-up survey, and two cases suffered from renal failure. Conclusion: In boy's LN, nephrotic syndrome was the main clinical manifestation, and class IVwas the main pathology type. Lower morbidity and atypical clinical symptom were main reasons of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis",

Data was analyzed by univariate \u03c72 test and multivariate logistic regression model using SPSS 11.0. Result: Univariate analysis showed that the following 4 variables were correlated to prognosis: different pathological types (P=0.005), heavy proteinuria at onset(P=0.003), different recipes (P=0.001) and irregular treat (P=0.000). In multivariate analysis, it was confirmed that irregular treatment (OR=9.955) was significantly associated with treated outcome.

A few clinical and paraclinical factors such as hypertension, percentage of cortical interstitial fibrosis,the value of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the onset of disease and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism are considered as promoting factors. However, there are controversial reports on relationship between ACE gene polymorphism and rapidity of progression of FSGS to ESRD in different population.

Introduction: The association of \"UTI & VUR\" with RS has been well established. However, this relationship tends to dissociate. This review aims to study the relationship between VUR and renal scarring in infants with UTI. Method: Infants \u2266 6 months with first UTI presented between Jan 02 to Dec 06 having both MCU & late DMSA scan and having no known urological abnormalities were included. The relationship between VUR and renal scarring were evaluated statistically as follows. Result: 115 infants having both MCU and late DMSA scan were reviewed. There were 48 refluxing ureters (48/230=20.9%): 10 associated with RS (20.8%) and 38 (79.2%) with no RS. RS occurred in 15.0% of kidneys with grade II VUR, 22.2% for grade III, 71.4%for grade IV, and absent in grade I. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for VUR to identify RS were 34.5%, 77.6%, 20.8% and 87.4% respectively. There were 29 scarred kidneys (29/230=12.6%): 10 (34.5%) (4 with R 2 scars) associated with VUR (grade II-IV) and 19 (65.5%) with no VUR (18 with single scar, 1 with 2 scars). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for RS to identify VUR were 20.8%, 87.4%, 34.5% and 77.6% respectively. Conclusion: In the current review, grade II-IV VUR was associated with RS in different proportions (15.0%-71.4%) while grade I dissociated from RS; and RS with R 2 scars also associated with VUR while single scar appeared to dissociate from VUR. The association/dissociation relationship between VUR and RS persisted with denotation.AD-191: A 20 YEAR-RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF SPECTRUM AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE OF UROPATHOGENS ISOLATED FROM PEDIATRIC INPATIENTS WITH COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONSLi CaoCapital Institute of Pediatrics, Beijing, China",

Method: We retrospectively analyzed 111 children with a diagnosis of HSP (Mean age 6.9\u00b12.3 years, Male: Female=55:56) from the years 2000 to 2003. One hundred and eleven children with HSP were divided into the two groups; 49 patients who were treated with only oral prednisolone (PL group) and 62 patients with oral prednisolone after intravenous dexamethasone (Dexa+PL group). Result: Palpable purpura was seen in all 111 patients (100%), abdominal pain in 55 (50%), and arthralgia in 65 (59%). There were no significant differences in the incidence of arthralgia between the two groups, but Dexa+PL group had significantly longer duration of fasting than PL group (0.7\u00b11.2 vs. 0.02\u00b1 0.1 days, P<0.01) due to more severe and frequent abdominal pain (68% vs. 27%, P < 0.01). Serum albumin levels were significantly lower in Dexa+PL group than in PL group (4.0\u00b1 0.4 vs. 4.3\u00b1 0.4, P<0.01) . However, the development of nephritis (21% vs. 32%, P=0.98), the number of relapse (4% vs. 11%, P= 0.167) and persistent nephritis at last follow-up (12% vs. 16%, P =0.563) were not much different between the two groups. Conclusion: Intravenous dexamethasone followed by oral prednisolone may be a useful and effective therapeutic strategy in HSP children who cannot tolerate oral medications due to severe gastrointestinal manifestations such as severe abdominal pain or melena.AI-064: COMPARISON OF CLINICAL OUTCOME ACCORDING TO THE DURATION OF CORTICOSTEROID THERAPHY IN CHILDHOOD HENOCH-SCH\u00d6NLEIN Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the incidence of relapse or nephritis might be influenced by the duration of corticosteroid therapy in children with Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP). Method: We retrospectively analyzed 186 children with a diagnosis of HSP (Mean age 6.3\u00b12.5 years, Male: Female=104:82) in two major hospitals in Ilsan, Korea from the years 2000 to 2007. One pediatric nephrologist from hospital A has used oral prednisolone in patients with mild symptoms and intravenous dexamethasone followed by oral prednisolone in those with severe symptoms (Group A, N=94). The other from hospital B has prescribed nothing in patients with mild symptoms and oral prednisolone in those with severe symptoms (Group B, N=92). Result: There were no significant differences in age, sex, body weight, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, serum protein and albumin levels between the two groups. The incidence of abdominal pain (45% vs. 50%, p=0.557) or arthralgia (61% vs. 61%, p=1.0) also did not differ between the two groups. However, the duration of steroid therapy was significantly longer in Group A than in Group B (21. 8\u00b1 8.4 vs. 6.1\u00b1 7.4 days, p<0 .0001) and the cumulative dose of prednisolone was also higher in Group A than in Group B (404.4\u00b1248.2 vs. 105.1\u00b1 137.4 mg, p<0.0001). The development of nephritis was more frequent in Group A (23% vs. 10%, p=0.017), while the incidence of relapse was higher in Group B (10% vs. 23%, p= 0.017). Conclusion: The longer duration of steroid use was associated with the lower incidence of relapse, but the higher rate of nephritis development. Therefore, corticosteroids should be used carefully in a selected group of HSP children, and be tapered rapidly after acute symptoms are controlled.Introduction: Childhood enuresis is a common condition all over the world yet Malaysian parents rarely discuss it with their doctors. To understand the reasons for this, we interviewed parents of children who came for consultation. Method: A questionnaire was designed to determine parents': (i) views on the cause of their child's bedwetting, (ii) previous coping strategies, (iii) reasons for seeking medical consultation and (iv) perception of the impact of enuresis on their child Result: Thirty-two parents of children aged between 7 and 16 years attending the Enuresis Clinic consented to this study. Ninety-two percent of the children had more than 3 wet nights per week yet only 44% had ever seen a doctor. Deep sleep was thought to be a cause in 81% and \"drinking too much\" in 47% whilst genetics/familial in 19%. Only 6% thought their child would \"outgrow\" the problem. All parents had tried at least one of the 10 coping strategies itemized. The three most common practices were restricting pre-bedtime fluids (81%), waking the child to void (97%) and \"lifting\" the child (62%). Diapers were used in 41% and punishment in 25%. Reasons for seeking consultation included fear of the effects on the child (97%), fear of an underlying medical problem (65%), restriction of the child's social activities (56%), the child's embarrassment (59%) and tired of washing sheets (44%). Parents' perceived impact on the child included low self esteem (77%) and social stigma (63%). Conclusion: Despite less than half the families seeking medical consultation for this self-limiting disease, children with nocturnal enuresis in Malaysia and their families are clearly distressed by the problem and its psychosocial consequences, in particular the social stigma and perceived low self esteem. It is time that medical practitioners address these issues in a bedwetting child and offer appropriate therapy. Introduction: Our ability to provide safe and effective drug therapy for infants and children is often hampered by a lack of dosing information derived from careful, well-controlled trials and the limited database available concerning drug safety in this patient population. This problem was first articulated 40 years ago that infants and children were becoming \"therapeutic orphans\". It is important to note that many of such medicines are frequently used off-label in relation to dose, indication, age, and route of administration in infants and children. We approach the problem of off-label uses of drugs in Japanese children with kidney diseases. Method: We reviewed 90 drugs for children with kidney diseases derived from four Japanese references for pediatric nephrologists and revealed off-label uses of drugs in relation to dose, indication, age, and route of administration. Result: There were 6 of 90 drugs with no product license in Japan but 2 drugs with product license in US or EU. 44 drugs (49%) had lack of pediatric drug formulations. 11 drugs (12%) were not licensed use in children with the kidney diseases but were licensed use in children with other diseases. 69 drugs (77%) were not existing dosing information for pediatric patients. 59 drugs (66%) were not existing explicit statements that the safety and efficacy in children. Conclusion: Most drugs of the Japanese physicians' references entries have either no existing dosing information for pediatric patients or explicit statements that the safety and efficacy in Japanese children with kidney diseases. The progress made in the solution to the therapeutic orphan problem during 30 years in US and EU. We work for a general level of comfort with pediatric clinical trials and undertake the problem of off-label uses in Japanese children with kidney diseases.",

Method: Physical examination and laboratory investigations were analyzed. Result: A 5 years old girl was admitted because of kidney subcapsular hydrops, proteinuria without edema, and hypertension (130/94 mmHg) for 50 days. No trauma or familial hypertension history were provided. No hydrops was found before the age of 1 year. Urinary RBCs were 5-7/Hp and protein was 77 mg/kg/24 hr. The serum albumin was normal. Ultrasound examination revealed normal sized kidneys, increased echogenicity in both kidneys, and subcapsular hydrops on the upper pole of the right kidney connected with an old renal fissure. UCG and fundus examinations were normal. GFR of the right kidney was slightly decreased as compared to the left (65 ml/min vs. 67 ml/min, by DTPA scan). By puncture of hydrops, yellow clear fluid was drained, the analysis showed similar composition to that of original urine, so subcapsular urinoma was diagnosed. Urine collection from two kidneys separately was performed by cystoscopy; nonselective proteinuria of 1+ was found in urine from the right and 2 + from the left kidney. Analysis revealed urea 36.8 mmol/l, potassium 6.92 mmol/l, creatinine 0.42 mmol/l in the right kidney urine compared to urea 77.2 mmol/l, potassium 11.19 mmol/l, and creatinine 1.29 mmol/l in the left, which suggested that the right kidney function was compromised. According to proteinuria from both kidneys with microscopic hematuria, without edema and hypoalbuminemia, glomerulonephritis was diagnosed. Conclusion: The girl was diagnosed with glomerulonephritis and subcapsular urinoma. It was a rare case because of their co-incidence. Reasons for the hypertension, if caused by the glomerulonephritis or the pressure by subcapsular urinoma, as well as reasons for subcapsular urinoma need to be clarified during the follow-up.",
