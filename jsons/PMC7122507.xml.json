The fungal infections can affect any part of the body and cause superficial mycoses (affecting only the outermost layers of the skin and hair), cutaneous mycoses (extending deeper into the layers of the skin, hair, and nail), subcutaneous mycoses (involve the dermis, subcutaneous tissues, muscle, and fascia), or systemic mycoses (dissemination in the body). The fungal diseases (listed in Table 12.1) are classified according to the three important phyla of the fungal taxonomy \u2013 Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, and Zygomycetes. These diseases turn out to be severe if disseminated, which is common in the immunosuppressed. Candidiasis is one of the highly frequent fungal infections in 90% of untreated, advanced HIV cases suffering from oropharyngeal candidiasis according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 statistics. Another study reported overall mortality rate of approximately 80% for zygomycosis (Ribes et al. 2000) and 80\u201390% in invasive aspergillosis of high-risk leukemia patients and allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients (Chamilos and Kontoyiannis 2005).",

Surgical intervention has shown improving survival rates for many patients, but surgery is not the only solution in treating fungal diseases. The currently available antifungal drugs comprise polyenes, macrolides, azole drugs, and echinocandins (Mukherjee et al. 2005). Among them, the polyene amphotericin B is the first-line drug of choice for invasive mycoses (Ribes et al. 2000). These drugs have drawbacks such as nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity as exhibited by liposomal amphotericin B, narrow spectrum of activity as shown by fluconazole, and itraconazole causes problems with absorption (Pauw and Picazo 2008). Moreover, the fungi are acquiring resistance recurrently against novel antifungal agents (Rogers 2008) either due to defects in drug import and efflux of drugs, variations in intracellular drug processing, alterations in the enzymes of a target-specific biosynthetic pathway, or its competitive inhibition (Chamilos and Kontoyiannis 2005; Bhanderi et al. 2009).",

There have been reports of the use of gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, DNAzymes, and RNAi therapy. RNAi scores several benefits over other techniques, for instance, its effective delivery into various organs at low concentrations, thereby increasing safety, its cost-effectiveness as compared to protein/enzymes, and its non-immunogenicity bypassing the interferon pathway (Ruddon 2007). Subsequently, it was marked the \u201cBreakthrough of the Year\u201d in 2002 by Science magazine. One of the recent developments in this field has been the FDA approval of siRNA (short interfering RNA) drug DGFi in 2008, developed by Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for use in kidney transplantation. Another siRNA-based therapy, Sirna-027 originally developed by Sirna Therapeutics for the treatment of acute macular degeneration, is moving forward into phase II clinical trials. Hence, the vital relevance of innovative treatments like the siRNA therapy can be envisaged for antifungal infections. RNAi application has also been identified in functional genomics and therapeutics, viz., cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and multiple sclerosis besides fungal infection. This chapter presents the prospects of RNAi technology in fungal infection.",

            "text": "RNAi naturally occurring \u201csequence-specific gene silencing\u201d phenomenon and evolutionarily highly conserved mechanism are well developed in eukaryotic organisms, which is induced by double-stranded small noncoding RNA (dsRNA). These RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways have been comparatively thoroughly known and established in plant and animal system and are widely investigated in a variety of fungi, few of them are reported on opportunistic pathogenic fungi in human. The RNAi machinery in fungi shares similar mechanistic principles with other organisms where RNAi has been discovered which consists of dsRNA precursors, Dicer enzyme, RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), and the target mRNA. The dsRNA is processed into short interfering RNA (siRNA) by two steps \u2013 the initiator step and the effector step. In the initiator step, the dsRNA is cleaved by the enzyme Dicer of the RNase III family (Jinek and Doudna 2009) into specific lengths of 21\u201325 nucleotides. In the effector step, the siRNA must segregate into \u201ccompetent\u201d single strands (the guide strands) which are guided through a ribonucleotide protein complex called the RISC (Siomi and Siomi 2009), a member of the Argonaute family of proteins (Song et al. 2004a, b; Leuschner et al. 2006; Fulci and Macino 2007). Both Dicer and RISC complex require ATP for energy. The Argonaute has a N-terminal domain, PAZ domain, a middle domain, and a PIWI domain. It is the \u201cguide strand\u201d which is incorporated into RISC; the non-incorporated strand known as the \u201cpassenger strand\u201d is also crucial for proper target mRNA cleavage. Until the passenger strand is not cleaved at ten nucleotides from the 5\u2032 phosphate of the guide strand, target mRNA cleavage is severely impaired (Leuschner et al. 2006). The cleaved target mRNA is utilized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) generating more dsRNA that is further recognized and cleaved by Dicer to increase the number of siRNA molecules (Schepers 2005). Genes responsible for RNAi have been discovered in fungi such as qde-1 (quelling deficient-1) which was the first RNAi gene discovered in N. crassa which encodes a cellular RdRp. Simultaneously, qde-2 was cloned and found out to encode Argonaute protein. Further, partially redundant Dicer proteins DCL-1 (Dicer-like-1) and DCL-2 have been characterized from N. crassa by reverse genetics (Li et al. 2010).",

In S.cerevisiae, it has been attributed to the absence of conserved components like Dicer-like RNases, Argonaute or PIWI-like components, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, RNAi was very recently discovered in S. castellii, which is closely related to S.cerevisiae, and also in C. albicans, a common human pathogen, by David P. Bartel\u2019s lab [22] (Drinnenberg et al. 2009). They found out that these species with noncanonical Dicer activity have RNase III domain containing gene to generate siRNA(s).

These include optimal siRNA designing, off targeting, and efficient delivery systems apart from the genomic architecture and levels of organizational complexity. For example, whole-genome duplication events are commonly observed in fungi (Wapinski et al. 2007; Dujon et al. 2004; Ibrahim et al. 2009) such as in Rhizopus oryzae, giving rise to paralogous genes might not have 100% nucleotide sequence similarity with each other, which are actively expressed to code for an enzyme. Such constraints are often envisaged while designing effective siRNA against a fungal enzyme, as targeting only one out of many genes for a given enzyme target doesn\u2019t result in a very high efficacy for silencing (Yamada et al. 2007) silenced only one out of the three \u03b1-amylase genes in Aspergillus oryzae and found merely 10% silencing, which is not sufficient to enter the therapeutic phase. Hence, designing common siRNA for all the genes targeting an enzyme becomes a very arduous task. Chitin synthase is a well-accepted antifungal drug target, yet it cannot be used to design siRNA(s) for R. oryzae because genome level analysis has revealed that 23 genes can encode chitin synthase (Ibrahim et al. 2009). The prospects of selecting the conserved regions of an enzyme are lucrative, as a single siRNA might be effective against several fungi causing a particular disease, but the enzyme should be present exclusively in fungi. Hence, target selection is critical toward its gene nature and diversity.",

            "text": "The soaking method, transient RNAi, has limitations in terms of duration and experimental variability of the RNAi effect. The expression of inverted repeat (IR) transgenes, transgenic RNAi, has been shown to induce stable RNAi in fungi (Liu et al. 2002). However, variability, often, has been observed in the gene silencing effect by dsRNA-producing transgenes depending on the target gene, the type of construct, site of integration, and transgene copy number. An IRT is constructed using a target gene sequence, which is incorporated in an organism-specific plasmid. The plasmid containing IRT is transformed into the organism that upon transcription forms a hairpin loop which is cleaved by endogenous Dicer to generate siRNA(s). The generated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) cleave the endogenous mRNA(s) with the help of RISC. Considering that there are several hairpin-expressing RNA systems available for robust RNA silencing using a tissue-specific RNA pol II promoter for tissue-specific expression of dsRNA and that hairpin RNA assures efficient formation of dsRNA, it is the frequently used method for induction of RNA silencing (Paddison and Vogt 2008). One type of IRTs is a long-hairpin RNA (lhRNA) which generally consists of more than 300 bp open reading frame, a spacer of approximately 250\u2013500 oligonucleotides and an inverted repeat of the gene sequence. The IRT construct is inserted into the plasmid specific for a particular fungus and is transformed into the respective fungi either by protoplast formation or electroporation. But the transformation/cloning efficiency for long inverted repeats of a cDNA is very low, and the selection process is very time-consuming. The construction of lhRNA(s) is difficult as it involves several rounds of PCR and cloning steps, and moreover, it\u2019s necessary that vectors/plasmids should be available for each species to carry out siRNA delivery. Generally the longer size of spacer helps in the easy cloning of the inverted repeat and improves the efficiency of RNAi. Here, the use of IR constructs containing a short spacer (20\u201350 bp) in the middle of an inverted repeat improves the cloning efficiency (Yu et al. 2004). Moreover, the presence of introns as a spacer in the constructs also improves their effectiveness and enhances cloning efficiency [48. 49] (Wesley et al. 2001, Kalidas and Smith\n2002). Nevertheless, these strategies have been successfully used to trigger silencing in various fungal systems like Bipolaris oryzae (Moriwaki et al. 2007) in which an IRT was constructed consisting of sense and antisense polyketide synthase gene of 756 bp encoding for melanin production separated by a spacer of cutinase gene intron obtained from a study on Magnaporthe oryzae (Kadotani et al. 2003), and this yielded melanin-deficient (white) phenotype in 70% transformants. Another study reported only 12% transformants of xlnR encoding xylanases and cellulases of A. niger (Oliveira et al. 2008) showing decreased activities compared to the control strain. The reason was attributed to either rearrangement in silencing constructs or apparent decrease in xylanolytic activities or may be absence of \u201ctrue\u201d co-transformants.",

            "text": "A preliminary way to investigate the knockdown of a gene and percentage of silencing in fungus is to measure the mycelial growth of fungus by either colony diameter method or mycelial dry weight method (radial growth assays). Blotting techniques, fluorescence imaging, and biochemical assays are the further confirmatory tests which are used to analyze silencing at the RNA and protein levels. A study was carried out by Kadotani et al. (2003) in the blast fungus M. oryzae (Holen 2006) in which they investigated RNA silencing using enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Sense-sense, antisense-antisense, and sense-antisense IRT constructs of eGFP separated by a partial sequence of \u03b2-glucuronidase gene as internal spacer were employed. Significant silencing was induced only by sense-antisense IRT construct as detected by the loss of GFP fluorescence using an image analyzer. Several studies have employed Northern blot analysis for studying gene silencing in various fungi (Yamada et al. 2007; Kadotani et al. 2003; Hammond et al. 2007, 2008; Hammond and Keller 2005; Segers et al. 2006; Janus et al. 2007). The captured fluorescence images of plasmids (IRTs) containing fluorescence tags like GFP (Segers et al. 2006; Janus et al. 2007) assist in better understanding of protein localization, confirm the presence of plasmid in the cell, and also facilitate in differentiating the silenced from the non-silenced transformants. Real-time PCR and the reverse transcription PCR (Khatri and Rajam 2007; Oliveira et al. 2008; Janus et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2002) setup are also employed using appropriate gene-specific primers to detect and quantify the gene transcript levels. Liu et al. conducted a study (Liu et al. 2002) on RNA silencing in the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans where they constructed IRTs on genes related to capsule synthesis and adenine biosynthesis pathway. They observed 25% reduction in the gene expression imparting the transformants with dull and pink colonies, respectively, and silencing analyzed by employing reverse transcription PCR with gene-specific primers and PCR product stained with SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain for analysis of DNA-associated fluorescence. Janus et al. investigated a reporter system DsRed to identify silencing transformants by cosilencing DsRed with the protein isopenicillin N synthase (pcbC) involved in cephalosporin C biosynthesis in the filamentous fungus Acremonium chrysogenum and employed immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody against the isopenicillin N synthase to assess the downregulation of the pcbC gene (Janus et al. 2007). Biochemical assays can be performed as well which are specific for the enzyme/protein of interest to evaluate silencing of the target protein by specific siRNA(s). Hammond and Keller in 2005 executed the norsolorinic acid (NOR) analysis by thin-layer chromatography and observed whether the A. nidulans aflR IRTs can suppress NOR production (Hammond and Keller 2005). Research discoveries in vitro need to be accompanied by establishment of the potentiality of siRNA as a therapeutic. The antifungal drug dosages within the therapeutic window have been tested and determined on animal models, mostly murine models (Ibrahim et al. 2008a, b) for fungal diseases like zygomycosis, aspergillosis, candidiasis, cryptococcosis; but no pharmacological studies have yet been conducted on animal models employing siRNA therapy for fungal infections. Thus, dedicated efforts are needed to assess siRNA therapy for mycoses in various animal models and further investigate in humans through clinical trials.",

For instance, the past few decades have seen a rise in the opportunistic invasive fungal infections (mycoses) due to significant increase in the population of immunocompromised patients. The limitations of existing antifungal therapies have provided impetus toward exploring RNAi as a therapeutic option. N. crassa was the organism in which the first RNAi gene was discovered which was succeeded by numerous in vitro studies to achieve improved silencing in fungi and promising RNAi as a therapeutic tool. Identification of a potential target gene is necessitated against which siRNA is designed in silico, and recent whole-genome studies in fungi have greatly expedited the novel drug discovery process. Even though RNAi-related research discoveries have made rapid progress from in vitro to in vivo and clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, proper pharmacokinetic parameters of safety and efficacy for RNAi still remain to be answered for mycoses. RNAi as a therapeutic approach is relatively at a nascent stage, and uninterrupted probing should prove useful to drive it as a preferred option for the treatment of mycoses in the long run.",
