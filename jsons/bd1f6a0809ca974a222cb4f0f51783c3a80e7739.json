Patients with vascular diseases are especially prone to development of complicated disease if infected by SARS-CoV-2. 1 It is our responsibility as vascular surgeons to protect our patients while keeping an active practice because most of our patients have a life-or limb-threatening disease. We work in a tertiary university hospital in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, which has a universal public health system. Our department is one of largest in the country and accommodates a significant part of all referrals to vascular surgery, including complex aortic diseases, with an annual volume of approximately 1700 vascular procedures. Most of our patients treated are urgent or emergent. Among many other issues, this pandemic presented us with a considerable dilemma. As our hospital is the largest in Lisbon, we had to accommodate a significant number of the COVID-19 patients, including a high demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Under these circumstances, how could we protect our patients and simultaneously keep up a practice to respond to urgent cases?",

The staff with some ICU experience started to have specific ICU training to be called on to support COVID-19 ICUs if the hospital needed it. Senior staff was put on leave to be called on if necessary. All of this was done to obtain a maximum reserve of team members. Staff symptom checking was routinely performed to ensure that no one had contracted the disease, and all positive nonprotected contacts were sent home for quarantine.",
