In this study, a crude extract from P. multocida showed antiproliferative activity against Con A\u2010stimulated mouse spleen cells. Known virulence factors of P. multocida include P. multocida toxin,18 OMPs, capsule, pili, and LPS.1 LPS and OMPs have been shown to modulate immune system responses by inducing proinflammatory cytokines.14 However, none of them has been reported to show antiproliferative activity. Although the crude extract may have been contaminated with LPS, the heat\u2010treated crude extract lost activity, indicating that the causative agent was likely a heat\u2010labile protein and not LPS.",

PM27 showed the same antiproliferative activity as did the crude extract. Its activity was lost after heating to 100\u00b0C for 20 min. These findings point to PM27 as the causative agent. In a comparison using molecular weight as an indicator, the molecular weight of P. multocida toxin was 146 kDa,19, 20 whereas the molecular weights of OmpA and OmpH were 35.4\u201338.5 kDa and 37.5 kDa, respectively.21 Therefore, the P. multocida toxin was considered to differ from virulence factors that have been reported previously. However, it was also possible that PM27 is a larger, known virulence factor that was broken down after production or during the purification process. N\u2010terminal amino acid analysis of PM27 was therefore performed to determine the identity of PM27 and rule out that possibility. BLAST search results indicated that PM27 is the UPase gene from P. multocida. UPases have been identified from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and are known to be key enzymes in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of uridine to uracil and ribose 1\u2010phosphate.22, 23 However, UPase has not been reported to show antiproliferative activity. To confirm that, a rUPase was constructed and its activity analyzed; the findings indicated that UPase has the same antiproliferative activity as the original purified protein. It has been reported that de novo pyrimidine biosyhnthesis is required for the virulence of Toxoplasma gondii.24 Therefore, it has been investigated the possibility of attenuated vaccine using de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathoway deficiency strain.25, 26 However, that UPase from bacteria plays a role as a virulence factor has not previously been reported. Thus, our study identified a new activity for UPase from P. multocida.",
