We totally obtained 286 potential therapeutic targets for 119 kinds of candidate compounds from Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin Table S4 ). In order to directly represent the interpretation of the complex relationships between active compounds and their targets, C-T network was constructed ( Fig 9B) . Amongst them, those ones with high interconnection degrees were responsible for the high interconnectedness of the C-T network, especially Quercetin (degree = 10), 5,7,2',6'-Tetrahydroxyflavone (degree = 12), Kaempferol (degree = 12), 4'-Hydroxywogonin (degree = 11), Ganhuangenin (degree = 11), Baicalein (degree = 9), Gancaonin O (degree = 8), and Norwogonin (degree = 8). As shown in the C-T network (Fig 9B) , a compound regulated multiple targets, while multiple compounds possibly regulate the same target.",

Among the results of KEGG pathway enrichment, we selected the pathways in the basic biological processes of metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes and organismal system. There are 20 target-enriched pathways (Table 5) , which act on the immune system, inflammation, cellular processes, and endocrine system, respectively. Thus, we postulated that Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) CM pair exerts therapeutic effects on multiple targets and pathways of the human body through hits complex active component. network-based computational methods, an integrated system pharmacology approach was used to predict targets, construct networks, and explore the molecular action of high-frequency Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) (GH) CMs-pair. In present study, 85 and 34 kinds of active ingredients with favorable bioactivities and contents were selected from Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) by ADME filtering, providing some foundational clues for thorough investigation on this CMs-pair. By analyzing the network topology of targets, 30 kinds of important targets were identified. By using network systematic analysis, GH CMs-pair could regulate the proteins related to immune system, inflammation, cellular processes, and endocrine system. COVID-19 leads to a strong immune response and inflammatory storm, in which a large number of cytokines are activated. GH CMs-pair may regulate the immune-related pathway Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, T-cell and B-cell receptor signaling pathway, as well as cytokine action related pathways such as TNF signaling pathway, NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway signaling pathway to inhibit the activated cytokines, relieve the excessive immune response and eliminate inflammation. From perspective of molecular network, GH CMs-pair exerted overall regulation through multi-ingredient and multi-target synergistic effect.",

The results fully reflected the synergistic mechanism of multi-components and multi-targets of CMs. In view of the limitations of virtual screening results, further experiments in vivo and in vitro are needed to verify the results of this study in the later stage, so as to provide experimental basis for the research and development of antiviral natural drugs.",

Its successful effects have been preliminarily confirmed in clinical studies when applied to SARS and H1N1 influenza epidemics (Lau et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2013). Meanwhile, Qing-Fei-Pai-Du decoction is a CM prescription recommended by the National Health Commission of China for the treatment of COVID-19, which was optimized by combination of a number of classical prescriptions from Treatise on Febrile and Miscellaneous (Han dynasty) (Zhong, 1963). Thus, the experiences and effective prescriptions of CM in treating and preventing viral infection diseases for thousands of years is worthwhile to explore and are of great significance and reasonable. We excavated 574 CM prescriptions for treating epidemic diseases through 96, 606 prescription. Among them, 40 kinds of high frequency CMs, 36 high-frequency CMs-pairs and 6 kinds of high-frequency triple-CM-groups were mined by frequency analysis method were used to analyze the collected prescriptions. Among the commonly used CMs beneficial for antiviral, Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) were given high priority CM pairs for selection used in CM prescriptions against pestilence by mining the compatibility rules of prescriptions with association rules analyses. The molecular docking results implied that 66 compounds in 26 kinds of CMs probably show a potential anti-SARS-COV-2 activity by binding with the ACE2 and 3CL hydrolase. It's worth noting that Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) contained the most potential compounds of 20, followed by HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix). Meanwhile, based on",
