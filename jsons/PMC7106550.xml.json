Considering the fact that the European Union applies pre-emptive culling to handle the outbreaks of highly contagious so-called transboundary animal diseases (TADs) the costs of TAD outbreaks are tremendous, because of animal health measurements applied, destruction of carcasses and compensations paid to farmers. The estimated costs of the UK foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks in 2001 were approx. \u00a33.800 million (USD 5.186 million) [3], [4], while avian influenza (AI) outbreaks in the Netherlands in 2003 cost at least USD 612 million. Classical swine fever (CSF) outbreaks in the Netherlands between 1997 and 1998 caused USD 2.52 billion losses. Whenever it is possible the \u201cvaccination to live\u201d policy should be followed, because mass slaughter of animals in an outbreak has not only extremely high costs, but it is also rejected by the society on ethical basis and [2].",

            "text": "Contrary to all unequivocal advantages of vaccines and vaccination, both the past and the presence offer several examples when a certain vaccine was contaminated [8]. Foamy virus (Spumaretroviridae) was identified as a contaminant of primary monkey kidney cultures used for vaccine production in the early 1950s. The virus causes a foam-like syncytial effect in cell cultures leading to cell lysis and destruction of cell cultures. However, they do not cause any clinical symptoms in vivo. Infected animals induce life-long persistent infection [11]. In the 1960s it was shown that yellow fever live attenuated vaccines prepared in chicken embryo fibroblasts were infected with avian leukosis virus (ALV) [12]. Nevertheless, no increased risk for cancer was observed in vaccinated individuals, which was expected considering that ALV does not grow efficiently in mammalian cells [13], [14], [15]. Calicivirus was found in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [16]. Jorgensen et al. [17] revealed Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine strains in different live poultry vaccines, while in 1990 a live attenuated multi-component canine vaccine was contaminated with a serotype of bluetongue virus causing abortions and death in pregnant bitches [18], [19]. Pestiviruses (BVDV types 1 and 2) are one of the most common EAs in veterinary and human vaccines [20], [21], [22], [24], [25]. The potential source of pestivirus in live vaccines prepared for human and veterinary use may be the use of FCS, which is applied for growing the cells during vaccine production [23]. As a further threat besides BVDV type 1 and 2 novel bovine pestiviruses (BVDV 3) were also detected in foetal calf serum used by diagnostic laboratories and bioindustry. These batches usually originated from Brazil, while contaminated bovine serum samples came from Thailand [26], [27], [28], [29]. The diagnostic problem posed by novel bovine pestiviruses is primer sets designed to BVDV 1 and 2 usually fail to detect BVDV 3 sequences.",

Without the pre-amplification of the clinical sample most microarrays are not sensitive enough [61]. The use of random PCR step prior to microarray hybridisation can improve the sensitivity of microarrays enabling in the same time the detection of EAs without any a priori knowledge of the infectious agent. Considering the fact PCR-based random amplification of whole genome was demonstrated to generate incomplete coverage of genome, Erlandsson et al. [62] used isothermal multiple displacement amplification of whole genomes by the Phi29 polymerase. Phi29 polymerase allows very good coverage of the genomes because of its high processivity and extremely low error rate [62]. Phi29 polymerase can also be used for improvement of sensitivity of an agent-specific real-time PCR [63]. In the so-called AMP-PCR, an unbiased random Phi29 pre-amplification is carried out before a specific real-time PCR reaction. Thus, AMP-PCR increases the specific PCR signal allowing the detection of positive samples normally under the detection limit of the specific real-time PCR. As AMP-PCR reaction takes place in one vessel, the risk of contamination is eliminated and nested PCR can be replaced by AMP-PCR in situations where increased sensitivity is needed e.g. in routine PCR diagnostic analysis [63].",

Regular revision of testing of Working Seed Viruses (WSVs) and batches/finished products should be necessary at GMP and GLP level. Information should be collected about the geographic location of the facility, quality of facilities/laboratories, quality and health status of personnel and consolidated data from epidemiological monitoring concerning the status of epizootic/enzootic diseases in the geographic origin of the starting materials. All this can lead to a reduction in the number of EAs, which should be tested within the production process. Furthermore it would be essential to define the steps of the manufacturing process where molecular methods can be applied. The reduction in number of EAs and the increasing use of molecular methods instead of traditional animal testing are in profound concordance with \u20183R's rule as reduce, refine and replace animal testing in the manufacture and testing of veterinary medicinal products, which also recognised by Ph. Eur (see chapter 1.1) [7]. The Ph. Eur. already allows for the use of nucleic acid techniques provided these techniques offer comparable sensitivity and specificity to the conventional methods (see chapter 2.6.21). The new methods may have to be assessed not in comparison with the conventional and compendial methods, but rather in the light of the current needs. To reach this latter aim validation of testing methods in collaborative studies with the involvement of Official Medicines Control Laboratories (OMCL) would also be necessary. OMCLs are key players for the control of immunological and pharmaceuticals products. Their significance is based on their neutral status as OMCLs belong to national competent authorities.",

Subsequent investigations revealed that the detected RT activity was associated the presence of the incomplete endogenous avian retrovirus (EAV-0 and avian leukosis virus). However, these viruses proved to be non-infectious as the viral envelope protein required fro viral infectivity is missing, their presence in vaccines triggered concerns regarding the safety of these vaccines [65]. These events pointed out that PERT similarly to PCR offers extreme increase in sensitivity compared to traditional methods [66].

To minimise such risk and ensure high quality and safe vaccines have a profound importance. State-of-art molecular methods like metagenomics and microarrays can improve the capacity of both manufacturers and competent authorities to reveal contaminations and to identify the well-known and the potentially new EAs. The implementation of these methods into routine tests of vaccines and their acceptance by Ph. Eur. or EMA as official methods need validation. A further requirement of the acceptance is to improve interpretation of results obtained by these tests especially in comparison with those obtained by currently mandated tests. A past example underlines that the improved ability to screen vaccines for contamination has a direct relation to the improvement of vaccine quality and safety. Subsequently SV40 had been revealed in vaccines, manufacturers were requested by control authorities to test for the presence of SV40, which led to the full clearance of SV40 from vaccine batches released after 1961.",
