Patients with recent hospitalization, underlying neurological, cardiopulmonary and immunodeficiency disorders and cystic fibrosis were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or caregivers before enrollment. The study protocol was approved by Policlinico Umberto I ethic committee. Every patient underwent a nasal wash for the detection of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and a pharyngeal swab for Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection; all specimens were collected within 24 hours of hospital admission. Nasal washings were obtained injecting 3 ml of sterile saline solution into each nostril and then collected with a syringe. A panel of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or nested PCR methods have been used for the detection of 14 respiratory viruses, included RSV, hRV, Flu A and B, PIV 1-3, ADV, CoV OC43, 229E, NL-63, HUKI, hMPV and human Bocavirus (hBoV), as described [8]. Real-Time PCR reactions targeting the RdRp and the E- genes of SARS-CoV-2 were developed in-house following the protocols described by Corman et al [9]. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by Real-Time PCR reactions on DNA extracted from oropharyngeal swabs, as described [10]. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were systematically collected. On hospital admission, we assigned each child a clinical severity score (from 0 to 8) according to respiratory rate, oxygen saturation in room air, presence of retractions and ability to feed [8]. A chest X ray was obtained in all children and radiological findings were classified as single pulmonary consolidation, multiple pulmonary consolidations or interstitial findings.",

Among them, 39 (92.8%) children were hospitalized between October 1 and February 29 and only 3 (7.2%) from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020, after the introduction of the lockdown by the Italian government to slow the spread of COVID-19. The months with a higher number of hospitalization were December (13/43, 31%) and February (13/42, 31%); on the contrary October and March had a lower rate of hospitalization for pneumonia (respectively 1/42, 2% and 3/42, 7%). Two children (2/42, 5%) were admitted in the paediatric intensive unit care (PICU). In 42 children studied, 31/42 (74%) had at least one virus detected; of these, 7/42 (17%) had a coinfection (6 RSV-hRV and 1 hRV-hMPV). M. pneumoniae was identified in 4/42 (10%) children, including 2 (5%) coinfections with hRV. The only hCov detected was HUK1 in 2/42 children (5%); none of children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Analysing all detected pathogens, hRV was the most frequently detected agent (17/42, 40.5%), followed by RSV (12/42, 28.5%) and Flu A and B (6/42 14.3%). Concerning viruses\u2019 distribution, hRV peaked in December-January (12/17, 70.5%), RSV in December (8/12, 66.6%) and Flu A and B were exclusively found in February (6/6, 100%) (Fig. 1\n). Moreover, we focused on clinical features of patients with only virus detected and we found that children infected with RSV had a highest clinical severity score. Children infected with CoV-HKU1 were the youngest. Laboratory findings showed no significant differences. Considering radiological features, 50% of patients with hRV had a single pulmonary consolidation, while children positive for RSV had a high rate of multiple pulmonary consolidations (83.3%) (Table 1\n).",

            "text": "Our aim was to describe viral aetiologies, with particular interest in detecting SARS-CoV-2, in hospitalized pneumonia children under 14 years of age. In contrast to a plenty of papers declaring RSV the main cause of children\u2019s CAP [2], in our study hRV was more frequently associated with pneumonia. However, the clinical severity score was higher in RSV patients and hRV was found in 9/17 cases (53%) in coinfection, consistent with the notion that hRV is very frequently detected in respiratory infections during childhood. According to previous studies, no significant laboratory and radiological differences between children hospitalized for pneumonia were observed. Since the enrollment period partially overlapped with COVID-19 peak infection in Italy, we investigated also SARS-CoV-2 distribution in children hospitalized with CAP in a tertiary University Hospital in Rome. Kelvin AA et al. suggest that children are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but frequently they do not have notable disease, raising the possibility that they could be facilitators of viral transmission [11]. In our population, we detected two cases of HKU1, an HCoV belonging to the same genus beta of SARS-CoV-2, but no children with CAP tested positive for the novel CoV. These results seem consistent with several recent papers who have demonstrated that children appear to be less susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [6,12]. Reasons remain unclear [12]. Despite some evidences describing pneumonia as the most frequent clinical manifestation among COVID-19 hospitalized children [7], in our population, in Rome, no children tested positive for COVID-19, even PICU admitted ones.",

Environmental risk factors such as household crowding and air pollution, as well as virulence factors, play a fundamental role in developing lower respiratory infection [13] and particularly pneumonia [14]. Accordingly, the lockdown that Italian authorities established to confine COVID-19 and the resulting decrease in social interactions (schools and day nurseries closure) were likely determinant in reducing CAP which required hospitalization.",
