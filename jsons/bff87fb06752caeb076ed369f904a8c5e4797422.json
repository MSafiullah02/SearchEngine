            "text": "Purpose: The aim of this paper is to investigate the association between suicide and Lyme and associated diseases (LAD). No journal article has previously performed a comprehensive assessment of this subject. Introduction: Multiple case reports and other references demonstrate a causal association between suicidal risk and LAD. Suicide risk is greater in outdoor workers and veterans, both with greater LAD exposure. Multiple studies demonstrate many infections and the associated proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory-mediated metabolic changes, and quinolinic acid and glutamate changes alter neural circuits which increase suicidality. A similar pathophysiology occurs in LAD. Method: A retrospective chart review and epidemiological calculations were performed. Results: LAD contributed to suicidality, and sometimes homicidality, in individuals who were not suicidal before infection. A higher level of risk to self and others is associated with multiple symptoms developing after acquiring LAD, in particular, explosive anger, intrusive images, sudden mood swings, paranoia, dissociative episodes, hallucinations, disinhibition, panic disorder, rapid cycling bipolar, depersonalization, social anxiety disorder, substance abuse, hypervigilance, generalized anxiety disorder, genital-urinary symptoms, chronic pain, anhedonia, depression, low frustration tolerance, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Negative attitudes about LAD from family, friends, doctors, and the health care system may also contribute to suicide risk. By indirect calculations, it is estimated there are possibly over 1,200 LAD suicides in the US per year. Conclusion: Suicidality seen in LAD contributes to causing a significant number of previously unexplained suicides and is associated with immune-mediated and metabolic changes resulting in psychiatric and other symptoms which are possibly intensified by negative attitudes about LAD from others. Some LAD suicides are associated with being overwhelmed by multiple debilitating symptoms, and others are impulsive, bizarre, and unpredictable. Greater understanding and a direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics is needed. It is suggested that medical examiners, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other epidemiological organizations proactively evaluate the association between LAD and suicide.",

Suicidality statistics include those with suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans, suicidal attempts, self-harm injuries, and completed suicides. The 2014 US statistics show 9.3 million (3.9%) have suicidal thoughts, 2.7 million (1.1%) made a plan, 1.3 million (0.6%) attempted suicide, 494,169 visited a hospital for self-harm injuries, and 42,773 completed suicide. 5 A number of ratios are established which include 13/100,000 commit suicide per year, there are 25 attempts for every completed suicide, 12 people harm themselves for every completed suicide, and 0.3% of those with suicidal thoughts commit suicide per year. 5 Based upon the CDC research, there are at least 329,000 cases of Lyme disease diagnosed per year, mostly in children and middle-age adults, but only 25,000-40,000 per year meet their Surveillance Case Definition. 6 According to the CDC, \"Surveillance Case Definitions establish uniform criteria for disease reporting and should not be used as the sole criteria for establishing clinical diagnoses.\" 7",

Clinical practice guidelines may provide additional assistance. The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality maintains the National Guideline Clearinghouse and works closely with the Institute of Medicine to maintain standards for trustworthy evidencebased clinical practice guidelines which can assist with diagnosis. 8 In the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the only guidelines specifically addressing Lyme disease are the ILADS Guidelines (2014), but the American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults (2016) are also listed. [8] [9] [10] These guidelines recognize the value of a thorough clinical exam, mental status exam, pattern recognition, and clinical judgment, and the ILADS guidelines discuss laboratory assessment in determining the diagnosis. 9, 10 Although not currently recognized in the National Guideline Clearinghouse, many turn to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Lyme disease guidelines (2006) for guidance in diagnosing Lyme disease. 11 The IDSA guidelines also recognize the value of a thorough clinical, laboratory assessment and physician judgment. They have a disclosure stating guidelines \"are not intended to supplement physician judgment\"; adherence to them are voluntary and their application is to be determined by the physician while recognizing \"each patient's individual circumstances\". 11 Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2017:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 1577 suicide and lyme and associated diseases For diagnosis, there are many similarities between the ILADS and IDSA guidelines, and a comprehensive clinical assessment is essential.",

The Adverse Event Reporting System described a 43-year-old man who committed suicide seven months after receiving the vaccine who described severe pain and an inability \"to get relief from 14 different doctors he had seen\". 29, 49 Depression is a well-recognized contributor towards suicidal risk. In the general population, there is a 16.2% lifetime prevalence and a 6.6% prior 12-month prevalence. 50 Although depression is not prevalent in the early stages of LAD in patients who are diagnosed and treated early and effectively, 51 in the later stages of LAD, the prevalence of depression is significantly higher with findings of 37%, 52 37%, 53 50%, 54 51%, 55 64%, 56 47% (mood swings), 57 and 80% (with intrusive symptoms). 28 Intrusive symptoms can also contribute to causing suicide and violence, and 34% of patients with a history of LAD acquire intrusive symptoms. 28 Among these patients, 69% become suicidal, while 31% develop homicidal tendencies. 28 A survey of a patient support group concluded hopelessness by lack of educated doctors, isolation, debilitating symptoms, depression caused by Lyme disease, feeling like a burden, and watching our friends die contributed to suicidal feeling in patients with LAD. 58 environmental exposure and suicide Suicide risk is greater in outdoor workers, in particular forestry workers, and veterans. [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] Recent studies demonstrated the rate of suicide was highest among persons working in the farming, fishing, and forestry group (84.5/100,000), while the lowest rate was found in the education, training, and library occupational group (7.5/100,000). 64, 65 While tick-borne disease exposure could be a contributor to those working in farming and forestry, it might not explain the high rate in fisherman. 66 Veterans can be at risk for tick-borne diseases from exposure during basic training and deployment; however, other causes of suicidality must also be considered, such as family disruption from deployment, being trained to kill, toxic exposure, and trauma. 67 ",

Latent infection with T. gondii is a prevalent condition that has been linked in humans to suicide and suicide attempts. T. gondii titers may quantify a proneness to suicidal behavior. In a sample of 20 European nations, the prevalence of T. gondii was positively associated with national suicide rates, and T. gondii seropositivity was associated with a sevenfold greater risk of self-directed violence.

Infections impact CNS functioning by provoking cytokines that \"can modulate the concentration of monoaminergic neurotransmitters and their metabolites in various regions of the CNS\". 77 There is a significant body of research demonstrating a strong association between inflammation, brain inflammation, elevated cytokine levels, and suicide. [78] [79] [80] \"Most suicide attempters, or subjects with suicidal ideation, show an imbalance in the immune system.\" 81 Interferon treatment for hepatitis C has been a clinical model demonstrating the significance of inflammation-mediated mental symptoms including suicide. 82 Cytokine activation has been associated with both suicide and self-harm behavior. 83 \"IL-6 is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of suicide attempters and related to symptom severity.\" 84 The brains of suicide victims had significantly increased microgliosis, which demonstrates the presence of brain inflammation, compared to subjects who died from other causes. 85 \"Increased levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were shown in the anterior prefrontal cortex of teenage suicide victims.\" 86 \"Suicidal ideation was significantly associated with an elevated inflammatory index of C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1, in patients with depression.\" 87 A meta-analysis on inflammation in suicidal patients demonstrated \"there are aberrant cytokine levels in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain samples from suicidal patients. The levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were most robustly associated with suicidality, and these cytokines may help distinguish suicidal from non-suicidal patients.\" 88 In summary, conditions that cause brain inflammation can contribute significantly to suicidality. Lyme disease has been associated with the same proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 that are associated with suicide. 89 ",

Charts in which the diagnosis of Lyme disease was unclear were excluded from the study. The 253 charts that met the criteria were divided into four groups based upon symptomssuicidal and homicidal, suicidal not homicidal, experiencing explosive anger not suicidal or homicidal, and not suicidal, homicidal, or experiencing explosive anger. The patients who were both suicidal and homicidal were considered to be the most severe cases, while the patients who were least severe were the patients who were not homicidal, suicidal, or experiencing explosive anger. Names were converted to an identifier before entering findings into a database of individual participant data. Clinical findings most relevant to the diagnosis and suicidal risk were analyzed. All 29 of the suicidal and homicidal charts were reviewed, and a representative sample of 20 charts from the suicidal group was pulled at random from the suicidal but not homicidal group and 20 charts were pulled at random from the not suicidal, homicidal, or experiencing explosive anger group. A comparison of individual participant data is made by comparing the findings for all patients suicidal and homicidal (N=29) to the findings for those suicidal and not homicidal (N=20) and not homicidal or suicidal or experiencing explosive anger (N=20). The premorbid health status is the control for each group and is shown in parentheses in Figure 1 . Symptoms associated with risk were ranked by comparing the prevalence of different findings among the three different groups. Two representative cases of suicidal LAD patients are described. In the case reviews, identifying information was removed to conceal identities. In the nonfatal case, written consent was obtained for publication. In the fatal case, written consent from the next of kin was obtained for publication.",

At work, I had been highly awarded throughout my career but it became a real struggle and I did not understand why. When I went to work that morning, I was tired, frustrated and in a state of dread and fear and I drove 100 miles past the base. I only drank a small amount of the scotch; the bottle was still nearly full. I have never been a big drinker and as a result I fell asleep on the beach. I woke up the next day wondering how I got there and why and drove back to the base and turned myself in for Away Without Leave (AWOL). After being diagnosed, treated and having recovered, I can relate to other veterans living with undiagnosed and untreated Lyme disease.",
