Care facilities often serve as epicenters for the spread of such pathogens. Experience in a field setting has historically demonstrated the ability to reduce, but not eliminate nosocomial infections among healthcare providers. Despite four decades of experience managing Ebola in a field setting, an estimated 815 confirmed and suspected infections of caregivers occurred [1]. The World Health Organization estimated that care providers were 21\u201332 times more likely to become infected than the general population [2].",

Over the years, the guidelines from CDC have evolved significantly, as new information has surfaced regarding the spread of these infections [3].

This level of lab safety is reserved for a handful of deadly viral pathogens for which there are no treatments or vaccines and that have the potential to infect laboratorians. In this regard, a conventional hospital room employs methods similar to a BSL-2 laboratory, while a negative pressure isolation room employs BSL-3-like controls.

The \u201cAmerithrax\u201d attacks of October 2001, occurring after the World Trade Center assault, and two outbreaks in 2003 added momentum, particularly as they demonstrated the risk to healthcare providers from their patients harboring lethal pathogens. The first was severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a highly lethal and very contagious disease transmitted via the airborne route. The second was Monkeypox, which arrived in the USA carried by imported Gambian giant rats. Some physicians, fearful of becoming infected, balked at treating patients infected with monkeypox [20]. The 2015 outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), in Korea, led to 186 cases and significant nosocomial spread. The outbreak exposed several factors that helped facilitate the outbreak, including \u201clate diagnosis, quarantine failure of \u2018super spreaders,\u2019 familial care-giving and visiting, non-disclosure by patients, poor communication by the South Korean Government, inadequate hospital infection management, and \u2018doctor shopping\u2019\u201d [21]. The concept of biocontainment became more mainstream, though, during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, as patients were brought back for care to US and European facilities [3]. The nosocomial infection of two nurses who cared for a severely ill patient in Dallas, Texas, solidified the role of biocontainment units in medicine in the USA [22].",

In the old \u201cslammer\u201d model, this was not an issue, since caregivers in fully encapsulated \u201cspace\u201d suits passed through a decontamination shower when leaving the unit and suits were reused. This minimized the need for autoclaving. With the use of disposable suits, PAPR hoods, gloves, face shields, aprons, and booties, the amount of PPE waste was enormous. Patient waste was another unexpected challenge, due to the profound volume of emesis, diarrhea, and contamination of clothing and linens. On a given day, up to 40 bags of medical waste could be generated for a sick patient [33]. Units adapted by putting in pass-through autoclaves (usually more than one for redundancy to allow for maintenance of one while remaining operational). Areas need adequate space for storage of solid waste, in case the autoclaves malfunction. Specific validation of autoclave protocols, along with proper waste packaging, may also be needed, to ensure effective decontamination, depending on the agent in question [34]. Handling of waste must take into consideration for textiles (linens, pillows, mattresses, and privacy curtains) in addition to solid waste. Liquid waste handling was also a challenge [30\u201332]. Most facilities don\u2019t have the luxury of a steam sterilization plant on-site, as the slammer facility did. They used expedient measures such as pouring Micro-Chem Plus (Emory SCDU) or \u201cEcolab neutral disinfectant cleaner\u201d (NBU) into the toilets, with an appropriate contact time, prior to releasing to the general sewage stream. Placing a cover over the toilet prior to flushing limits the potential for droplet spread. Different health departments may have local requirements for such handling.",

Dovetailed with this recommendation, the US Department of Health and Human Services has designated one facility in each of ten Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regions around the USA as regional \u201cEbola and Other Special Pathogen Treatment Centers\u201d [36]. Three of those facilities, Emory University, University of Nebraska, and Bellevue Hospital, have been designated as national treatment centers. These three centers have joined in a consortium called the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC), which trains caregivers on PPE and provides education site assessments of hospitals. Other facilities around the country have met certain criteria to serve as Ebola treatment centers, which include the following elements: operational coordination, staffing and training, clinical competency, PPE, policies and procedures for healthcare worker safety, laboratory safe work practices, private care rooms with designating donning/doffing spaces, inter-facility transportation plans, and waste management [36]. Even among these facilities, design features appear to be vastly different. For example, 94% of them have their isolation unit within the main hospital building, 43% have separate wards, 51% have separate rooms within another ward, 3 (6%) are stand alone, and 70% have separate air handling systems, and of the 24 units inside other wards, 14 (58%) have independent air handling systems. Twenty-three of those twenty-four (96%) have a physical barrier separating the isolation units. Only 10 of the 47 ETCs that responded to a survey on capabilities had all of the following: negative pressure isolation, an anteroom, on-site sterilization with autoclaves, and HEPA filtration. Some of the major limitations of these units include bed capacity and the need for dedicated, multidisciplinary staff [36].",

In this vein, some of the features embraced by biocontainment units might be adopted by other facilities. One key feature is early identification and triage of such patients at the places where they are most likely to present for care \u2013 in the emergency room or acute care and primary care clinics. Assessments of patient flow within a facility and potential contact points between patients and caregivers, family members, and other patients are a critical part of risk assessment. Having protocols in place to query patients about recent travel, ill contacts, or respiratory illness may be beneficial in those areas. Preparation for all comers and ensuring procedures for evaluation are as \u201cidiot proof\u201d as possible is key, because variable adherence is a huge challenge.

This would include some neighboring space for staff changing, storage space for PPE, and possibly an on-site shower [24, 38]. Positioning the isolation area a short distance from the entry point into the facility and laboratory assets, thus reducing the length of passage through the facility of a potentially communicable patient or potentially contaminated laboratory samples, should reduce potential risk to others [26]. The patient room should be equipped with surfaces that are easy to wipe down for disinfection, and designated equipment should be selected for easy decontamination. Having a room capable of negative pressure air handling, independent from the hospital\u2019s primary air handling system, with HEPA-filtered exhaust, is a plus. Other general features include easy access to hand washing stations and PPE [35].",

Features planned for included access and egress of patients, materials, and supplies as well as patient transport. The unit went to great lengths to vet the appropriate staff and provide adequate orientation. Ensuring individuals interested in participating embrace the culture of safety and are willing to work in a team environment is very important. In addition, time spent in PPE can be physically demanding, and working in such an environment is stressful, so individuals should be screened for a minimum level of fitness \u2013 both physical and also psychological. The second phase included addition of video monitoring capability and text messaging. Unit leadership empowered all team members to be equally accountable for safety. Unit personnel engaged in regular drills and debriefs, and larger drills brought in organizations outside the hospital facility, such as the regional airport, the local US Air Force base, and the state health department. Unit activation occurred in advance of the first patient arriving in September 2014.",

It is worth noting that despite a facility\u2019s layout or the type of PPE used, limiting the spread of infection relies on people. It starts with having a workplace culture and climate of safety [41]. Infrastructure is of little utility without appropriate policies and procedures for safety [35]. This comes from the top down. It also includes appropriate redundancies, appropriate levels of staffing, recurrent training and observation of procedures, and having the right, interested caregivers, who are willing to work within a team and follow procedures. Any planning is only as strong as the weakest link. Gershon found six foundational elements for a successful climate of safety [42]. These include senior management support, absence of workplace barriers to safe work practices, worksite cleanliness/orderliness, good staff communication and minimal conflict, frequent training and safety-related feedback by supervisors, and PPE availability and engineering controls.",
