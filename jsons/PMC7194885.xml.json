Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been the primary means for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 (Huang et al., 2020). However, molecular detection carries the risk of false-negatives because of low viral loads in specimens (Pang et al., 2020). Serological testing, another common laboratory diagnostic, can diagnose illness by detecting antibodies. Serological studies on SARS-CoV-2 appear to be scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of serological detection to COVID-19 and the dynamic variance of viral antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In this study, 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 33 suspected patients in whom the disease was finally excluded by nucleic acid test twice and who were rapidly discharged, were included to investigate the diagnostic value of serological detection to COVID-19. In addition, the dynamic variance of viral antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection was also examined.",

Furthermore, Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou was a designated tertiary hospital and mainly admitted patients with mild to moderate symptoms in Hangzhou. Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms, in concert with recent studies (Huang et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020, Guan et al., 2020). In the control group, the patients were generally younger, more often male, and less commonly presented any co-existing illness when compared to those in the infected group.",

Moreover, the IgG titers of the three positive patients in the control group were only weakly positive. In the COVID-19 group, IgM and IgG were also both found to be positive in one case before laboratory confirmation for the first time. Therefore, COVID-19 should be considered when serum IgM or IgG is positive. In the COVID-19 patients, the IgG-positive rate (88.9%) was found to be higher than the IgM-positive rate (48.1%) before conversion to virus-negative by molecular detection. Interestingly, three IgG-negative patients were also IgM-negative in this study. The duration from symptom onset to this serological test in these three patients was 0 days, 5 days, and 8 days, respectively. Furthermore, it was observed that serum viral antibodies increased only slightly in the early stage of the disease. Hence, it may be that serum viral antibodies have not been produced yet and could be undetectable. Zhang et al. found that the IgM and IgG positive rates were 50% and 81% on day 0 (the day of first sampling) and increased to 81% and 100%, respectively, on day 5 (Zhang et al., 2020). Thus, COVID-19 cannot be excluded at an early stage when viral serological testing is negative.",

Furthermore, the IgG-positive rate was consistently higher than the IgM-positive rate, and this phenomenon was also observed in the study by Zhang et al. (2020). There were two patients with both IgM and IgG negative after oral swabs were negative twice. The interval between laboratory confirmation and serological testing was 10 days for one of these patients and 14 days for the other. A lag period was found, as antibodies specifically targeting MERS-CoV would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset (Al Johani and Hajeer, 2016). Therefore, we cannot infer whether viral antibodies have not been produced yet or have turned negative, because of the use of only one serological test. As well as the high positive rate, we found that the IgG titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before. In this study, these COVID-19 patients were discharged soon after oral swabs were negative on two occasions. Whether higher antibodies titers in SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with better outcomes needs to be studied further.",
