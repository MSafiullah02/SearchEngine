The aim of this study was to look for the warning index in severe COVID-19 patients. We investigated 43 adult patients with COVID-19. The patients were classified into mild group (28 patients) and severe group (15 patients). A comparison of the hematological parameters between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6), D-dimer (D-D), glucose, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (P < .05). The optimal threshold and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of IL-6 were 24.3 and 0.795 \u00b5g/L, respectively, while those of D-D were 0.28 and 0.750 \u00b5g/L, respectively. The area under the ROC curve of IL-6 combined with D-D was 0.840. The specificity of predicting the severity of COVID-19 during IL-6 and D-D tandem testing was up to 93.3%, while the sensitivity of IL-6 and D-D by parallel test in the severe COVID-19 was 96.4%. IL-6 and D-D were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 patients, which has important clinical value.

The disease and the virus that causes it have been named as COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2, respectively. In January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiple cities in China, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. [1] [2] [3] Human to human transmission is strongly associated with COVID-9 and SARS-COV-2. Respiratory droplets and human to human contacts are the main routes of transmission of the virus. 4 In the early stages of this disease, symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection occur, with some patients rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other serious complications, which are eventually followed by multiple organ failure. 5 Therefore, early diagnosis and timely treatment of critical cases is very crucial. At present, the occurrence, development, mechanism of prognosis and immune status of patients with Xiaowu Wang and Linding Wang contributed equally as the last authors. COVID-19 are still unclear. In this study, we have assessed the hematological characteristics of the patients. Also, we have determined the correlation between clinical laboratory data and the severity of COVID-19 in adult patients. Moreover, we have determined the predictive value of clinical laboratory data for the severity of COVID-19.",

All are imported cases. The clinical presentations are very similar to SARS-CoV. Coronaviruses (CoVs), a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses, can infect a wide variety of animals, including humans, causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases. 6 Human CoV is one of the main pathogens of respiratory infection. 5 Most patients have mild symptoms and a good prognosis. So far, a few patients with SARS-CoV-2 have developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, ARDS, or multiple organ failure and have died. Patients with severe illness developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. 7 So far, no specific treatment has been recommended for CoV infection except for meticulous supportive care. 8 Currently, the source of the infection has not yet been identified. The approach to this disease is the use of personal precautionary measures to reduce the risk of transmission, and early diagnosis of the disease. This study reported the results of blood routine, blood biochemistry, coagulation function, and infection-related biomarkers of the adult patients with COVID-19. We found that WBC, LYM, NEU, MONO counts were not significantly different between the severe group and the mild group. However, Huang et al 7 found low lymphocytes and WBC counts in most patients. WBC (the severe group 4.26 \u00b1 1.64 \u00d7 10 9 /L and the mild group 4.96 \u00b1 1.85 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and LYM (the severe group 1.20 \u00b1 0.42 \u00d7 10 9 /L and the mild group 1.07 \u00b1 0.40 \u00d7 10 9 /L) were close to the bottom line of the normal range in many patients in our study results. This result suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARS-CoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells, induce a cytokine storm in the body, generate a series of immune responses, and cause changes in peripheral WBCs and immune cells such as lymphocytes. Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes",

The AUC of IL-6 and D-D were 0.795 and 0.750, respectively, while those of Glu, TT, CRP, and FIB were below 0.750, thus leading to poor predictive value. When IL-6 and D-D were jointly predicted, the ROC curve integral of severe COVID-19 was 0.840 (P < .01) as good predictors of severe COVID-19 under the ROC curve, and the combined detection effect was better. Combined detection was more efficient than independent detection. Logistic regression analysis showed that IL-6 and D-D could predict severe COVID-19. The combined detection of IL-6 and D-D plays a complementary role. The combination of severe COVID-19 can be greatly improved by selecting different combinations according to different situations. Early prediction plays an important role. When IL-6 was over 24.3 pg/mL and D-D was over 0.28 \u00b5g/L by series test and parallel test, the AUC of the COVID-19 with or without the severe was over 0.750, which also confirmed the high prediction efficiency. In conclusion, our findings suggest that IL-6 and D-D levels can be used to estimate the severity of COVID-19. If necessary, the levels of IL-6 and D-D should be measured, as they can help diagnose the severity of adult COVID-19 patients. This study has several limitations. Firstly, the sample size was relatively small compared with Wuhan, where the disease originated, which may have some impact on the statistical results. Secondly, due to the large-scale outbreak of the epidemic restricting the flow of people, data on healthy patients are lacking as blank controls. Since this study was a retrospective study, not all patients were continuously monitored for all indicators in the blood including IL-6 and D-dimer levels. In future studies, data will be collected from healthy patients as blank controls to further explore the predictive value of IL-6 and D-dimer for patients with SARS-COV-2 infection. (2019xkjT024).

The fluorescent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm each diagnosis made. Forty-three patients, aged 19 to 70 years (43.74 \u00b1 12.12 years), were recruited for the study. They comprised 17 females and 26 males. Blood samples were collected from each participant and then used for hematological investigations. The patients were then put into two groups in terms of the severity of the disease. Hence, there was a mild group (consisting of 28 patients) and the severe group (consisting of 15 patients). Permission to conduct the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fuyang Second People's Hospital; and informed written consent was obtained from each patient. 2.2 | Clinical laboratory data Routine blood tests (white blood cell [WBC] count, lymphocyte count [LYM], mononuclear count [MONO], neutrophils count [NEU]) were performed on the blood samples. Blood biochemistry parameters (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], glucose [GLU], urea, creatinine [Cr], cystatin[Cys-c], uric acid [UA], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were measured using HITACHI 7600-020 automated biochemistry analyzer. The reagents used were provided by Shanghai Shenneng-DiaSys Diagnostic Technology Company. Coagulation functions (the D-dimer [D-D], thrombin time [TT], prothrombin time [PT], fibrinogen [FIB], activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT]) were determined using Sysmax CS-5100 hemagglutinin analyzer. Procalcitonin (PCT) was detected by Biomerieux Mini VIDAS automatic fluorescence immunoanalyzer. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was detected by Roche Cobas E601 on the fully automated electrochemical luminescence immunodetector, using the corresponding reagent.

The results showed that patients with severe conditions would have abnormal coagulation. Coagulation activation could have been related to the sustained inflammatory response. Infection-related biomarkers appeared to differ between the two groups (IL-6). However, the proportion of IL-6 above normal was (36.10 [23.00, 59.20] pg/mL) in the severe group, which was significantly higher than that in the mild group (10.60[5.13, 24.18] pg/mL).
