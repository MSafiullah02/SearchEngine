We tracked daily variations in the average prevalence of topics across all comments. In order to improve visualization of patterns of topic change, we used locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) lines. To quantify the degree of change in prevalence, we compared 4-day periods using the two-proportion z-test. We used R version 3.6.1 for all analyses.

For instance, comparisons to the flu were embraced by the public. Early recognition of this reality could have led to more specific information dissemination campaigns and earlier public acknowledgement of disease severity. Questions about safely spending time outdoors peaked in mid-March, representing a missed opportunity for public guidance. Tracking and responding proactively to common questions, such as what material is best used for a homemade mask, may minimize the spread of misinformation. Notably missing from these Reddit topics were discussions of contact tracing, a growing area of public concern. Limitations of this study include that Reddit users are not representative of all segments of the population, and that Reddit data is not associated with a geographic location. Real-time monitoring of online COVID-19 dialogue holds promise for more dynamically understanding and responding to needs in public health emergencies.",
