CoVs have been divided into four main genera [2]: alphacoronavirus, which include animal pathogens, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) as well as human CoV NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E); betacoronavirus, which also include pathogens of veterinary relevance, such as bovine coronavirus (BCoV), equine coronavirus (ECoV), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as well as human CoV HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), human CoV OC43 (HCoV-OC43), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV); gammacoronavirus, which thus far include only avian coronaviruses, such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV); and deltacoronavirus [3], a newly discovered genus that includes Bulbul coronavirus HKU11. The betacoronavirus can further be divided into 4 subgroups, each containing different HCoVs. The betacoronavirus not only contain pathogens causing severe respiratory syndrome in humans and animals but also carry a high risk of interspecies transmission from zoonotic reservoirs to humans. Both features make them a research hotspot.",

Through different inoculation routes, such as the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system (CNS), MHV can cause a wide range of diseases [4]. MHV infection of the mouse is considered to be one of the best animal models for the study of virus-host interactions [[5], [6], [7]]. MHV-A59 is a commonly used laboratory strain and thus provides animal models for hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis-like disease, encephalitis and demyelinating diseases [8,9]. The MHV-A59 genome is 32 kb in length and encodes two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and several structural proteins, including nucleocapsid protein (N), envelope protein (E), spike protein (S) and matrix protein (M), in addition to a variety of accessory proteins. The two polyproteins need to be cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps), which then assemble into the replication-transcription complex required for genome replication. Nsp5, also termed 3CL protease or main protease (Mpro), mediates proteolysis at 11 distinct cleavage sites, and is essential for virus replication. Due to its high conservation and low mutation or recombination rates, Mpro is thought to be a potential target for wide-spectrum inhibitor design.",

On the one hand, the fundamental molecular catalytic mechanism was unraveled by studies on the crystal structure of Mpro in complex with peptide substrate analogs [10,11]. Mpros were observed to exhibit a conserved three-domain structure. Domain I and domain II form a chymotrypsin-like fold for proteolysis, while domain III mainly participates in the formation of homodimers [12]. In the catalytic site, the catalytic dyad and potential substrate-binding pockets (S1\u2014S5) were discovered [13,14]. On the other hand, the regulation of Mpro activity was investigated to gain a deeper understanding of the cleavage mechanism. First, it was found that the protease activity of Mpro could be related to its homodimerization in some way [15,16]. Then, long-distance communication was identified as a temperature-sensitive defect mutant in V184 or F219 could be readily recovered by a second-site mutation (S133 N or H134Y) [17,18]. Interestingly, all of these residues are distant from the catalytic site, substrate-binding pockets and dimerization interface.",

All protomers displayed a three-domain (I to III) architecture: domain I (residues 8\u2013100) and domain II (residues 101\u2013183) together constituted chymotrypsin-like folds, while domain III (residues 200\u2013303) exhibited five antiparallel \u03b1-helices arranged into a large globular cluster. The substrate-binding site was situated in the cleft between domain I and domain II. The catalytic dyad, composed of C145 and H41, was in the center of the substrate-binding site. The whole pocket comprised two featured deeply buried sites (S1 and S2) and several solvent-exposed sites (S3, S4, and S5) for the accommodation of different side chains in the substrate. Domain III was located right under domain II with a connected loop and contributed mainly to homodimer formation (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, F284 was located in the loop region in domain III and close to residues at the dimer interface. Interestingly, a temperature-sensitive suppressor is also situated nearby.",

Then, the cysteine situated at the enzyme active site undergoes nucleophilic attack on the reactive atom of the inhibitor, leading to formation of a stable covalent bond (E-I). The determined K\ni and k\n3 revealed a potent inhibition of MHV-A59 Mpro by N3 (Table 2\n). In our inhibitor-bound MHV-A59 Mpro structure, we observed a clear and continuous electron density between the C\u03b2 of the vinyl group of N3 and the S\u03b3 atom of C145, which confirms the formation of a covalent bond. The intermediate state is stabilized by H41 of the catalytic dyad and the oxyanion loop from F140 to C145 in which the backbone amides form an oxyanion hole (Fig. 2\na). The conformation of the oxyanion loop is tightened through the internal hydrogen bond between the side chain oxygen of S144 and the backbone nitrogen of L141. The correct position of the oxyanion loop is maintained by the following interactions: (i) a hydrogen bond between the backbone oxygen atom of F140 and the amide group nitrogen atom of the P1 side chain; (ii) a hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom of the P1 side chain and the imidazole ring N\u03b52 of H163; and (iii) hydrophobic stacking between the imidazole ring of H163 and the benzene ring of F140. Therefore, the P1 side chain helps to strengthen the hydrophobic stacking between H163 and F140 by forming hydrogen bonds with these residues and thus maintain the oxyanion loop in the proper position.",

According to an analysis of the MHV-A59 genome sequence, we found that all 11 Mpro cleavage sites possess glutamine at the P1 position. Such a strong preference for glutamine is also a common feature in most CoV Mpros. In our structure, the S1 pocket constituted by F140, L141, S144, H163, E166 and H172 suitably accommodated the N3 lactam ring (Fig. 2b). The protruding lactam ring formed hydrogen bonds to (i) the aforementioned imidazole ring N\u03b52 of H163 and backbone oxygen atom of F140; (ii) the side chain O\u03b51 of E166 at a distance of 2.5 \u00c5. Compared to those of other CoVs, the S1 pocket volume of MHV-A59 is similar to that of HCoV-HKU1, which is smaller than those of IBV and SARS-CoV. The size reduction of the S1 pocket is mainly attributed to a 90\u00b0 upward bending of loop L167-C171. In HCoV-HKU1, the smaller S1 pocket could better accommodate the smaller imidazole ring of histidine at P1 of the nsp13-14 cleavage site. However, for MHV-A59, such a smaller S1 pocket is not that necessary because no substitution is observed at the P1 position.",

Although leucine/methionine are the most abundant, many other alternative residues, such as valine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and proline, are also observed, which might imply less stringency of P2 specificity. The inhibitor N3 bears an aliphatic isobutyl group at the P2 site that mimics the leucine side chain. In our complex structure, the large hydrophobic side chain of P2 deeply protrudes into the buried S2 pocket via hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of H41, P52, and Y54 and is well accommodated onto the Van der Waals surface of the pocket (Fig. 2b). Residues constituting the complete S2 pocket also include L165, D187, A188, Q189, and S45\u2014N51, which form a group-specific lid arranged as a short 310 helical region. It is worth mentioning that the deletion at S46 and A47 lead to a reduction in lid volume, which makes the pocket partially exposed to solvent. In combination with the enzymology data we measured, we found that this deletion lowered the K\nm and k\ncat to an acceptable degree (Table 2).",

For domain III, IBV is the most different with an RMSD of 1.8 \u00c5. Considering the similarity of the topological structure of domain I\u2013III, the difference of PEDV Mpro is most likely caused by the reorientation of the connecting loop during crystallization packing. Moreover, the group-specific S2 lid also displayed diverse conformations. However, this structural diversity was reported to cause no group-specific substrate preferences. Above all, overall structure alignment demonstrates significant homology among these 7 CoVs.",

In our structure, the pattern of interactions between MHV-A59 Mpro and N3 is generally similar to that between other CoV Mpros and N3.
