We found that the recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD TM system was insufficient to improve the EV71 VLP yield. Nonetheless, BacF-P1-C3CD, a recombinant baculovirus constructed using the flashBAC GOLD TM system to express P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the CMV promoter, dramatically improved the VLP yield while alleviating the VLP degradation. Infection of High Five TM cells with BacF-P1-C3CD enhanced the total and extracellular VLP yield to %268 and %171 mg/L, respectively, which enabled the release of abundant VLP into the supernatant and simplified the downstream purification. Intramuscular immunization of mice with 5 mg purified VLP induced cross-protective humoral responses and conferred protection against lethal virus challenge. Given the significantly improved extracellular VLP yield (%171 mg/L) and the potent immunogenicity conferred by 5 mg VLP, one liter High Five TM culture produced %12,000 doses of purified vaccine, thus rendering the EV71 VLP vaccine economically viable and able to compete with inactivated virus vaccines.",

EV71 infection of children under 5 years of age may result in severe neurological complications and even death, and EV71 outbreaks in Taiwan led to 78 deaths in 1998 and 14 deaths in 2008 (for review see (Kung et al., 2014) ). The epidemics are even more serious in China, causing 7.2 million cases of HFMD and claiming 2457 lives from 2008 to 2012 . The increasing frequency of EV71 epidemics and fatality rates underscore the urgent need to develop vaccines against EV71. Currently, several forms of EV71 vaccines, such as inactivated whole virus (Cheng et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013b) , recombinant protein (Zhao et al., 2013) , synthetic peptides (Liu et al., 2010) and pseudotyped baculovirus that displays the major immunogen VP1 (Kiener et al., 2013) , have been developed. In particular, inactivated whole virus vaccines are the most exhaustively studied and clinical trials of different phases have been completed in China, Taiwan, and Singapore (for review see ). Besides these vaccines, virus-like particle (VLP) is the empty particle composed of viral structural proteins and devoid of viral nucleic acids, and has emerged as a promising vaccine platform (Lin et al., 2014b; Lua et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014) .",

During EV71 replication, the viral structural polyprotein P1 is first cleaved by 3CD protease into VP0, VP1, and VP3. Catalyzed by the encapsidation of viral RNA genome, VP0 is further processed into VP2 and VP4, resulting in the formation of mature virus (Lyu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012) . In addition, EV71 infection of susceptible mammalian cells results in the production of empty particles consisting of only VP0, VP1, and VP3 while lacking the RNA (Liu et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012) . Inspired by the natural EV71 virus assembly process, we have co-expressed recombinant P1 and 3CD using the baculovirus expression system, which resulted in the cleavage of P1 by 3CD into VP0, VP1, and VP3 and assembly into VLP in the Sf-9 insect cells (Hu et al., 2003) . Subsequently, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus, Bac-P1-3CD, that encoded P1 under the polyhedrin (polh) promoter and 3CD under the p10 promoter (Chung et al., 2006) . Infection of Sf-9 cells with Bac-P1-3CD successfully led to the P1 and 3CD co-expression and VLP production. After purification, the EV71 VLP was fairly stable (Lin et al., 2014a) and capable of inducing protective humoral immune responses in mice (Chung et al., 2010; Chung et al., 2008; Li et al., 2013) and monkeys (Lin et al., 2012) . Importantly, the VLP was able to trigger potent cellular immune responses and confer protection against viral challenge in mice (Chung et al., 2008) , thanks to the activation of dendritic cells through toll-like receptor 4 signaling (Lin et al., 2014c) .",

To enhance the VLP yield, we constructed Bac-P1-C3CD which expressed P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV) promoter. Bac-P1-C3CD infection of Sf-9 cells elevated the VLP yield to %40-65 mg/L under optimized culture/infection conditions (Chung et al., 2010) . However, excessive VLP degradation was observed during the production. Therefore, here we employed an alternative baculovirus vector system, in conjunction with appropriate baculovirus expression cassette design and cell selection, in attempts to improve the VLP yield and minimize the degradation. The VLP production yield, kinetics, and degradation using different baculovirus vectors were monitored. Whether the resultant VLP was able to trigger crossreactive immune responses and confer protection against lethal virus challenge was examined.",

The expression cassettes of P1-3CD, P1-I3CD, and P1-C3CD were digested from the pBac-P1-3CD, pBac-P1-I3CD, and pBac-P1-C3CD plasmids by SnaBI/AvrII, in which the P1 genes were under the control of polh promoter, while 3CD genes were under p10, ie1 and CMV promoters, respectively. The digested fragments were cloned into the pBacPAK8 plasmid (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) by EcoRV/XbaI to generate pBacPAK8-P1-3CD, pBacPAK8-P1-I3CD, and pBacPAK8-P1-C3CD plasmids. To generate the recombinant baculoviruses, Sf-9 cells were co-transfected with the donor plasmid and flashBAC GOLD TM DNA (Oxford Expression Technologies, UK). The resultant baculoviruses were designated as BacF-P1-3CD, BacF-P1-I3CD, and BacF-P1-C3CD, respectively.

Moreover, to impede the product degradation we employed the flashBAC GOLD TM baculovirus vector system which was shown to improve the recombinant protein integrity (Kaba et al., 2004) . We constructed BacF-P1-3CD, BacF-P1-I3CD, and BacF-P1-C3CD (Fig. 1A) , which expressed P1 under the polh promoter, but expressed 3CD under promoters with varying strengths: p10 for BacF-P1-3CD, ie1 for BacF-P1-I3CD and CMV for BacF-P1-C3CD. High Five TM cells cultured in the shaker flasks were infected with Bac-P1-3CD, BacF-P1-3CD, BacF-P1-I3CD, or BacF-P1-C3CD under the same condition (MOI 0.1, at 2 \u00c2 10 6 cells/mL) and the supernatant was collected at 3-6 days postinfection (dpi) for Western blot using rabbit anti-VP1 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1B) . Compared with Bac-P1-3CD, BacF-P1-3CD conferred lower VP1 production (an indicator of VLP yield), whereas BacF-P1-I3CD and BacF-P1-C3CD appeared to enhance the VLP yield after 4 dpi, as judged from the band intensities in Western blot (Fig. 1B) .",

Although the second generation recombinant baculovirus Bac-P1-C3CD was able to enhance the VLP yield (Chung et al., 2010) , the VLP proteins appeared to be unstable during the production phase. To enhance the VLP yield by boosting the P1 expression, we designed a panel of baculoviral constructs which coexpressed P1 and 3CD, yet with an hr1 enhancer or an HS4 insulator appended to the 3 0 end of P1 gene (Fig. S1 ), which were reported to enhance the recombinant protein yield (Viswanathan et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2009) . However, infection of High Five TM cells with these constructs failed to increase the VLP yield when compared with Bac-P1-3CD (Fig. S1 ). To reduce the 3CD expression by attenuating the p10 promoter strength, we employed truncated p10 promoters to drive the 3CD expression and used polh promoter to drive the P1 expression. However, the resultant baculovirus vectors still gave inferior VLP yield (Fig. S2) . Using the B5 genotype as an example, we also attempted to append a woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE, which reportedly enhances the RNA stability and protein production (Mahonen et al., 2007) ) to the 3 0 end of P1 gene or co-expressed P1 and 3CD in tandem under the polh promoter, with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element in between (Fig. S3) . We also constructed a baculovirus that expressed P1-IRES-3CD under the polh promoter and expressed an additional P1 under the p10 promoter (Fig. S3) . However, none of these baculoviruses improved the VLP yield when compared with the original design (co-expressing P1 under the polh promoter and 3CD under the p10 promoter).",

Therefore we adopted a different approach and selected the flashBAC GOLD TM system for the construction of recombinant baculoviruses (Fig. 1A) . The flashBAC GOLD TM system was distinct from the Bac-to-Bac 1 system in that v-cath and chiA genes were deleted from the baculoviral genome. Baculovirus cathepsin encoded by v-cath is a papain-like cysteine protease (Ohkawa et al., 1994) while chitinase encoded by chiA functions in concert with cathepsin and promotes liquefaction of the host in the latter stages of infection, resulting in the release of viruses to infect more cells (Hawtin et al., 1997) . Both v-cath and chiA are dispensable for viral replication/polyhedron production in insect cells, thus deletion of v-cath and/or chiA from the baculoviral genome hampers the liquefaction of hosts to some extent. Consequently, infection of insect cells with the recombinant baculovirus deficient in v-cath and chiA genes ameliorates the integrity of both intracellular and secreted recombinant proteins (Kaba et al., 2004) as well as elevates the expression yield of secreted and membrane-targeted proteins (Hitchman et al., 2010b) .",

The importance of replacing p10 promoter was further evidenced by our supplementary data which unveiled that 3CD expression driven by the full-length or truncated p10 promoter gave rise to inferior VLP yield, either using the Bac-to-Bac 1 (Fig. S1 ) or flashBAC GOLD TM (Fig. S4) baculovirus system.

Cathepsin encoded by v-cath is a cysteine protease synthesized late in infection as an inactive pro-enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is activated by proteolytic cleavage upon cell death (Hitchman et al., 2011) . Cysteine protease activity is the most abundant protease activity in the medium of virus-infected Sf9 cells (Gotoh et al., 2001) , which led to significant VLP degradation in the Bac-P1-C3CD-infected cell culture (Figs. 2B-2C). Since the flashBAC GOLD TM -based BacF-P1-C3CD was deficient in v-cath and chiA, the VLP degradation was minimal in the BacF-P1-C3CD-infected cell lysate (Figs. 2B-2C). Such reduction of proteolysis was also observed in Sf9 cells infected with a v-cath -/ chiAbaculovirus (for review see (Hitchman et al., 2011) ). Furthermore, chitinase is targeted to the ER and may act as a chaperone for the correct folding of pro-v-cath in the ER (Hom and Volkman, 2000) . Expression of chiA could not only activate the cathepsin function but also obstruct the ER, severely compromising the function and efficacy of the secretory pathway (Possee et al., 1999) . Altogether, deletion of v-cath and chiA could attenuate the VLP degradation and deterioration of cellular functions after baculovirus infection, thus facilitating the VLP protein production and assembly.",

These include the BestBac System (Expression Systems), BacVector-3000 (Novagen) and MultiBac (European Molecular Biology Laboratory). The MultiBac system remarkably improves the recombinant protein quality, reduces proteolytic breakdown (Berger et al., 2004) and has been exploited for enhancing the yield of HPV VLP (Senger et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, a baculovirus vector (flashBAC ULTRA TM , Oxford Expression Technologies) with 5 non-essential genes (v-cath, chiA, p10, p26, and p74) removed from the virus genome was developed, which was shown to further enhance the yield of recombinant proteins when compared with flashBAC GOLD TM deficient in only v-vath/chiA (Hitchman et al., 2010a) . More recently, a new flashBAC PRIME TM system (Oxford Expression Technologies) was developed, which claimed to increase the yield of VLP by inducing cell lysis at a very late stage of infection in Trichoplusia ni-derived cell lines (http:// oetltd.com/products/product/flashBAC_PRIME/). These systems, together with the intricate expression cassette design, may also improve the EV71 VLP yield.",

The chromatography process we used allowed for the recovery of %36% purified VLP (Lin et al., 2015) . The purified VLP was similar to the EV71 empty particle in size, shape and composition (Fig. 3) . As a result, immunization of mice with 5 mg VLP was sufficient to induce humoral immune responses that were as potent as those induced by same amount of inactivated EV71 virus (Figs. 4A-4B). Importantly, 5 mg purified EV71 VLP per dose induced immune responses capable of neutralizing homologous and heterologous EV71 strains (Fig. 4C ) and conferred protection against lethal virus challenge (Fig. 5) . Given the significantly improved extracellular VLP yield (%171 mg/L), the recovery efficiency (%36%) of extracellular VLP (Lin et al., 2015) , and the potent immunogenicity/ protection conferred by 5 mg VLP, one liter High Five TM culture was able to provide %60 mg purified VLP, which was equivalent to %12,000 doses of vaccine. Such high VLP yield renders the EV71 VLP vaccine economically viable, which should enable the VLP vaccine to compete with the inactivated virus vaccines.",
