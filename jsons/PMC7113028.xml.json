Additionally, other specialties are covered in 36 wards serving approximately 27,000 admissions and 244,000 patient-days of care every year. KAMC-R provides healthcare services to approximately 750,000 Saudi National Guard soldiers, employees, and their families. The care provided ranges from primary and preventive care to tertiary care. Approximately 9,170 HCWs were working for KAMC-R in jobs that involve direct patient care, including approximately 1,670 physicians, 4,660 nurses, and 2,840 other HCWs. Additionally, another 3,400 individuals were working for KAMC-R in administrative jobs that involve no direct patient care.

Exposed HCWs were defined as those who had been working in any department of KAMC-R during the outbreak period (mid-June to mid-September, 2015) and who had direct exposure (within 2 meters) or indirect exposure (being in the same room/department) to a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV infection within the previous 2 weeks with or without symptoms. A probable case was defined as a suspected patient or exposed HCW with inconclusive laboratory results (such as lack of confirmation by the Ministry of Health central laboratory, or having positive polymerase chain reaction on only 1 of the 2 genomic targets). A confirmed case was defined as a suspected patient or exposed HCW who had a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for MERS-CoV (Real-Time RT-PCR Kit; TibMolbiol). The sensitivity and specificity of the test were determined locally at 96% and 95%, respectively.",

The plan included strict enforcing of infection control measures, including droplet/contact isolation for suspected and probable cases and airborne/contact isolation for confirmed cases in addition to strict hand hygiene compliance. As the situation escalated, stricter measures were implemented, including airborne/contact isolation for suspected/probable cases. Because of ongoing identification of new cases, the plan was escalated on August 18, 2015, to the highest level\u2014that is, level 3, which includes closure of the ED, cancellation of elective surgical procedures, and suspension of all outpatient appointments and visits. Complete evacuation of the ED was achieved on August 22, 2015. With shutdown of the hospital services and engineering modifications, more locations (ICUs and wards) were dedicated for isolation and more rooms were converted to negative pressure rooms. Probable or confirmed HCWs were allowed to return to work after having a symptom-free week in addition to at least 1 negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test. The end of the outbreak was declared on September 28, 2015, after the completion of two 14-day incubation periods without further identification of new cases.",

Because the screening and the behavior of the MERS-CoV infection was considerably different in patients and HCWs, we compared demographic information, symptoms, medical history, and outcome measures between both groups. The \u03c72 or Fisher exact test, as appropriate, was used to test significant differences of categorical variables between the 2 study groups. The t test or Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate, was used to test significant differences of continuous variables between the 2 study groups.

The patients were either National Guard Health Affairs employees (23%) or their dependents (41%), and approximately one-third (36%) of the patients were not from the official National Guard Health Affairs served population. The majority (63%) of HCWs were nurses, and the rest were either physicians (12%) or other HCWs (26%), mainly patient care technicians and respiratory therapists. The majority (47%) of HCWs were working at the ED, while the rest were working in wards (23%), outpatient clinics (9%), ICUs (9%), and multiple locations within the KAMC-R (12%).

Although the attack rate among HCWs was reported to be lower than patients and family contacts,\n13\n HCWs represented a significant proportion of all detected cases of MERS-CoV in the current study and elsewhere. One-third of the confirmed cases in the current outbreak were HCWs. This was similar to what was observed in the Jeddah outbreak, where 31% of the 255 confirmed cases were HCWs.\n14\n Additionally, 40% of the 55 MERS-CoV cases reviewed in the United Arab Emirates were HCWs.\n15\n However, it was considerably higher than seen in other outbreaks: 13% in the Eastern region outbreak and 14% in the Korean outbreak.\n5\n\n,\n\n8\n Additionally, a review of the 99 cases detected after more than 5,000 screenings over a year in Saudi Arabia found that 19% were HCWs.\n13\n One reason that may explain the high proportion of HCWs at the time of outbreak, including in the current study, is the active screening for patient contacts, mass screening of certain units that harbor patients, and proactive screening of anxious HCWs. Additionally, the higher than expected (from previous outbreaks) number of community cases of MERS-CoV may have amplified transmission and increased the risk of HCWs.",

Factors that facilitated the spread of infection in and from the ED included the extreme overcrowding, uncontrolled patient movement, high visitor traffic, non-strict compliance with infection control recommendations, late recognition/isolation of some cases, and HCWs serving on both ED and other hospital locations. This was closely similar to the conditions believed to have contributed to the rapid spread of MERS-CoV in several hospitals in Saudi Arabia and South Korea.\n4\n\n,\n\n16\n For example, combinations of several contributing factors, such as crowded ED environment, close and unprotected contacts with a symptomatic case, and possibly fomite transmission, have been suggested as causes in the Korean outbreak.\n16\n Additionally, the ED received during the outbreak more than the expected number of community cases of MERS-CoV, which amplified ED transmission. This observation is also supported by the fact that there was an immediate decrease in new cases just after closure of the ED. Moreover, the commitment of KAMC-R to care for eligible patients regardless of the availability of beds and for noneligible cases in case of emergency, in addition to the lack of a divergence system, made this outbreak inevitable with difficult containment.",

Obviously, HCWs were younger, healthier, and with fewer comorbidities. Additionally, HCWs had a less severe version of the disease, as indicated by the higher frequency of asymptomatic cases and probable diagnosis. This may have reflected more intensive ascertainment rather than different disease behavior. For example, HCWs working in areas like ED and the dialysis unit were mass-screened to detect cases that otherwise would have been missed. Additionally, anxious HCWs were closely monitoring their symptoms and sought help frequently before they turned positive. This explanation was supported by the lack of major differences in the frequency of fever and respiratory symptoms among symptomatic cases of both patients and HCWs.",

Similarly, there was higher mortality among confirmed cases (mainly patients) than probable cases (mainly HCWs). This may reflect the younger age, better health, and earlier diagnosis among HCWs. This difference may reflect a detection bias that is typically seen in hospital outbreaks and may not be controlled except in a planned study design. The current 39% overall mortality and 59% patient mortality were similar to the Jeddah outbreak, where overall mortality was 36% and patient mortality was 59%.\n14\n Additionally, the overall mortality among accumulated cases in Saudi Arabia during the past 3 years was 43%.\n2\n However, the current mortality numbers were much higher than reported in the Korean outbreak, where 36 (19%) of the 186 died.\n8\n Interestingly, the mortality was 40% in the first half of the Korean outbreak before it significantly decreased at the end of outbreak.\n17\n This was explained by the possibility of a better ascertainment rate and the infection of younger, healthier individuals in the second half of the outbreak.\n17\n The mortality difference between the current and the Korean outbreaks may also reflect the higher comorbidity (80% vs 55%) and symptomatic disease (81% vs 74% for fever and 68% vs 18% for cough) in the current outbreak compared with the Korean outbreak.\n8\n\n",
