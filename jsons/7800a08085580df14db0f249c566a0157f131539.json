Limiting the discussion of the scarcity of essential things and avoiding such anxiety-provoking discussion can be a measure to limit panic buying. Similarly, at the individual level, fear of uncertainty may accelerate anxiety and it may result in poor self-regulation (failure in impulse control) leading to panic buying. Measures that reduce anxiety effectively and improve self-regulation (impulse control) may reduce PB behavior.",
