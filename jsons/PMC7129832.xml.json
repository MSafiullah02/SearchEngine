On physical examination, the body weight was 6.4 kg (body condition score: 2/5), and visible mucous membranes were slightly pale. A complete blood cell count measured with a multiple automated haematology analyser (pocH-100iV diff; Sysmex, Hyogo, Japan) revealed non-regenerative anaemia and thrombocytopenia (Table 1\n). On a peripheral blood smear, plasmacytosis (2% of blood leukocytes) and mild rouleaux were noted. The blood chemical profile measured with an automated biochemical analyser (Dri-Chem 7000 V; FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan) indicated hyperproteinaemia, increases in alanine aminotransaminase and alkaline phosphatase activity, and increased blood urea nitrogen (Table 1). Serum free T4 level measured by an automatic immunoassay analyser (IMX system; Abbott Diagnostics, North Chicago, IL) was below the reference interval at 0.88 ng/dl; (reference interval9 1\u20132.5 ng/dl) which supports the effects of other illness on thyroid levels. Tests for feline leukaemia virus antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus antibody were both negative (Snap FeLV/FIV Combo Test: Idexx, Westbrook, ME). A test for serum antibody directed to feline coronavirus was also negative (Marupi Lifetec, Osaka, Japan).",

In order to stabilise the patient before general anaesthesia and bone marrow aspiration, a whole blood transfusion was carried out on days 17 and 18. The bone marrow aspirate obtained on day 18 revealed hypercellularity with proliferation of atypical plasma cells (50.4% of all nucleated cells) and a relative decrease in the numbers of erythroid and myeloid cells (Table 2\n, Fig 1C and D). The plasma cells in the bone marrow showed marked anisocytosis, marked anisokaryosis, and occasional bi-nucleation. These cells were similar in appearance to the plasmablasts described by Mellor et al12 possessing an eccentric round to pleomorphic nucleus with a fine chromatin pattern, one to several nucleoli, and moderately basophilic cytoplasm containing fine azurophilic granules (Fig 1D). Serum protein electrophoresis revealed M-protein in the \u03b3-globulin fraction which accounted for 34.8% (3.8 g/dl) of the total protein concentration (10.8 g/dl) (Fig 2\n). Bence-Jones protein was shown to be present in the urine by a heat precipitation method. From these findings, the cat was diagnosed to have MRD.",

To detect IgG, IgM and IgA, primary antibodies directed to feline IgG, IgM, and IgA (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), respectively, and labelled streptavidin biotinylated antibody method were employed. For detection of Ig light chain, a direct immunochemistry using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-feline Ig light chain (\u03ba and \u03bb) (Bethyl Laboratories) was carried out. For the negative control, Tris-buffered saline was applied to the tissue sections instead of primary antibodies for immunohistochemistry. Most of the neoplastic cells in the bone marrow were negative for IgG, IgM, and IgA, but 5\u201310% of these neoplastic cells were positive for Ig light chain (Fig 3C). In the kidney, tubular casts and granules in the tubular epithelium were also positive for Ig light chain (Fig 3D).",

In a report by Mellor et al,6 a small number of circulating plasma cells were observed in only 1/24 cats with MRD. In a case report by Rahakrishnan et al,13 there was progression from a cutaneous plasmacytoma to dissemination of neoplastic plasma cells in the marrow (73%) and peripheral blood with associated neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. This is in contrast to this case where anaemia, thrombocytopenia and atypical plasmacytosis were observed on initial presentation. The progressive marrow involvement by the proliferative plasma cells uncommonly results in leukaemia4 but likely contributes to the cytopenias.",

This is consistent with a previous case report where the cat succumbed within 3.5 months and was also treated with multiple combined chemotherapy regimes. The classification scheme by Mellor et al12 defines a high proportion of plasmablasts as consistent with poorly differentiated MRD with short survival times (median 14 days). In the case described in this study, most of the neoplastic plasma cells corresponded to plasmablasts, therefore, the cat could be diagnosed with poorly differentiated MRD according to the categorisation system.12 Moreover, a feline case having MRD with significant plasmacytosis previously reported13 was treated with prednisolone, melphalan, doxorubicin, l-asparaginase, and lomustine, but the cat was euthanased 3.5 months after confirming the leukaemic progression. Thereby, significant peripheral plasmacytosis may indicate a poor prognosis in feline MRD although studies on a large number of cases are warranted.",
