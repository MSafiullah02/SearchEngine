Biofilm infections are typically chronic in nature, as biofilm-residing bacteria can be resilient to both the immune system, antibiotics, and other treatments. This is a comprehensive review describing biofilm diseases in the auditory, the cardiovascular, the digestive, the integumentary, the reproductive, the respiratory, and the urinary system. In most cases reviewed, the biofilms were identified through various imaging technics, in addition to other study approaches. The current knowledge on how biofilm may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease indicates a number of different mechanisms. This spans from biofilm being a mere reservoir of pathogenic bacteria, to playing a more active role, e.g., by contributing to inflammation. Observations also indicate that biofilm does not exclusively occur extracellularly, but may also be formed inside living cells. Furthermore, the presence of biofilm may contribute to development of cancer. In conclusion, this review shows that biofilm is part of many, probably most chronic infections.

Simultaneous colonization of tumor prone mice by toxin-producing B. fragilis and E. coli resulted in increased DNA damage, faster initiation of tumorigenesis, and greater mortality compared to mice colonized with either species alone, suggesting a potential link between a tumorigenic microbiota and early neoplasia of the colon [97] . Fusobacterium nucleatum can influence both inflammatory processes and cell proliferation. It is often found enriched in tumor tissues, and high numbers of F. nucleatum correlates with poor prognosis [85, 99] , however F. nucleatum may not be involved in the early stages of carcinogenesis, but may be involved in cancer progression [100, 101] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 147, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 631, "end": 635, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 868, "end": 872, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1605, "end": 1609, "text": "[96,", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1610, "end": 1613, "text": "97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1826, "text": "[97,", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1830, "text": "98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 2162, "end": 2166, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2372, "text": "[85,", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 2373, "end": 2376, "text": "99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2501, "end": 2506, "text": "[100,", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 2507, "end": 2511, "text": "101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colorectal Cancer"}, {"text": "Polymicrobial biofilms adhering directly to the epithelium were detected in colorectal tumors by SEM and FISH [102] .

Acute BP may result in complications such as reduced fertility, bladder infections, prostatic abscesses, urosepsis, and death. The disease can also progress to chronic prostatitis (CP) or chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) [198, 199] . If symptoms of bacterial prostatitis last for more than 3 months, it is considered to be chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP). Similar to UTI, the species most commonly associated with BP are E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. and other Enterobacteriaceae as well as E. faecalis [199] [200] [201] . Pathogenesis of CBP has been suggested to involve biofilm-forming bacteria [202] [203] [204] [205] . This hypothesis is based on the observations that bacteria can persist in the prostate for long periods of time, a high percentage of cases are refractory to treatment with antibiotics [200, 202] , and even when the treatment is successful, as judged by negative microbiological tests, symptoms may remain [202] . A few studies support the involvement of biofilm forming bacteria in the pathogenesis of CBP. Nickel et al. used an animal model of experimental BP and showed that chronic symptoms correlated with the presence of glycocalyx-enclosed bacterial microcolonies inside the ducts and acini of the prostate [206] . Occurrence of microcolonies seemed to be associated with a chronic inflammation of the gland. In support of this finding; scanning electron microscopy of prostate calcifications from patients with CBP showed structures reminiscent of bacterial microcolonies on the surface of, and embedded in, the calcifications [205, 207] . These observations were associated with isolation of bacteria, from the surface of calcifications, with the potential to form biofilms in vitro [207] . In addition, prostatitis appears to be correlated with occurrence in urine of E. coli with high capacity to form biofilm in vitro [203, 204] . However, biofilm formation may not be the only explanation for persistent bacterial infections in the prostate. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strains, which are often isolated from BP-patients, can invade prostate cells in a mouse model (NOD and C57BL/6J mice) as well as in cultured RWPE-1 and PEC-1 cell lines [208, 209] . In the mouse model, the UPEC strains were able to proliferate within the epithelial cells following invasion, and although the effect was strain dependent, the infection could induce and sustain pelvic pain in the NOD mice [209] . UPEC strains can also invade bladder epithelial cells, proliferate and form matrix-enclosed biofilm-like structures that has been referred to as intracellular bacterial communities (IBC) [210, 211] . Interestingly, the invasive capacity of different UPEC strains into the prostate cell line RWPE-1 correlated with both the ability to adhere to epithelial cells and the capacity to form biofilm on a plastic surface, in vitro [208] and similar results were observed with an adherent/invasive E. coli (AIEC) strain, which is highly similar to UPEC, isolated from an ileal lesion in a Crohn's disease patient [212] . It is therefore possible, but to our knowledge has not been demonstrated, that bacteria can persist in the prostate using a similar strategy.

However, a growing body of evidence suggests involvement of a persistent infection in the bladder due to IBC [213] [214] [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 900, "end": 905, "text": "[213]", "ref_id": "BIBREF215"}, {"start": 906, "end": 911, "text": "[214]", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 912, "end": 917, "text": "[215]", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}, {"start": 918, "end": 923, "text": "[216]", "ref_id": "BIBREF218"}, {"start": 924, "end": 929, "text": "[217]", "ref_id": "BIBREF219"}, {"start": 930, "end": 935, "text": "[218]", "ref_id": "BIBREF220"}, {"start": 936, "end": 941, "text": "[219]", "ref_id": "BIBREF221"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)"}, {"text": "IBC were first described in a mouse model using an immunosuppressed mouse strain and UPEC [210] , the primary UTI-pathogen accounting for 70-95% of cases.

These results indicate bacterial biofilm formation inside the bladder epithelial cells. IBC can facilitate bacterial immune evasion as shown by video microscopy where luminal bacteria of the bladder were consumed by neutrophils whereas bacteria that had invaded the epithelial cells were protected from neutrophil attack and could proliferate in the IBC [220] . In the mouse model, UPEC undergo three-stage cycles of invasion of epithelial cells, followed by proliferation as IBC and dispersion into the bladder lumen, which allows for a new round of infection of adjacent cells [220] .

Biofilm formation increases the bacteria's resistance against the defense mechanisms of the body, as well as antimicrobial treatments, thereby promoting chronic infections. Biofilms may also function as an environment that accumulate different bacterial species as well as bacterial numbers in certain locations. This can result in deleterious effects on host cells due to concentrated, sequential, and/or synergistic activities by the present bacteria. Furthermore, the mere presence of persistent biofilms may modulate the local immune response in several ways, e.g., by stimulating a local inflammatory response that can cause or aggravate tissue damage. These biofilm-mediated mechanisms have also been suggested to be involved in initiation and/or progression of cancers, such as CRC. In wounds, an additional effect of biofilm is that the physical presence may obstruct wound healing. Biofilm might also facilitate cellular invasion by pathogens, as indicated by the observed link between intracellular S. aureus and biofilm colonization in the upper airways. Interestingly, biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities have been identified, e.g., within the epithelial cells of the bladder of the urinary tract, which appears to result in bacterial immune evasion and persistent or recurrent infections. rhinosinusitis and cystic fibrosis. However, colonization in the form of biofilm may also serve as a sub-clinical reservoir for pathogens preceding clinical infection with planktonic bacteria, as observed for S. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx and UPEC in the urinary bladder.
