In the 2009\u201310 season, we note the occurrence of first an Influenza epidemic followed by an RSV epidemic, with very small overlap between the two epidemics. As such there is a notable time-delay between the peaks of the epidemic curves of Influenza and that of RSV.

The underlying concept is that any pathogen arriving at a susceptible LTZ is able to spread rapidly through the entire local population. This domination within an LTZ is to be expected since disease transmission within an LTZ is stronger than transmission between them. Such a situation would be particularly favoured if only a limited number of infected individuals invade a susceptible but heterogeneous region. The pathogen dominating an LTZ is likely to be the first successfully invading pathogen. In this extreme case, there would be zero overlap of the diseases in any LTZ, because each LTZ has only a single pathogen. Here, our working assumption is that transmission between LTZs has relatively minor impact at these time-scales. Hence, even if at the whole region scale (i.e. k = 1) disease signal overlap is high, as say in 2010\u201311, in the individual LTZs within the region the disease signal overlap should be expected to be far smaller, ideally close to zero.",

There is no question that detection of disease hotspots is an important activity in modern disease surveillance where it may be used as a real-time warning alert of any atypical activity. Our aims however are quite different, since here our goal is to determine if a city-area (i.e. Jerusalem) is essentially a single, well-mixed ecology in terms of pathogen transmission, or if there are additional spatial partitions within this limited geographic scope. To address the question in the most direct way, we make use of the robust k-means clustering algorithm, based only on proximity between home locations addresses.",
