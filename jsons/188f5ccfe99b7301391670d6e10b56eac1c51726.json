The studies were conducted in different contexts (e.g. SNS, opinion platforms, online review websites), countries (e.g. USA, China, Spain), using different products and services as examples (e.g. laptop, restaurants, hotels) [9, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Additionally, studies used various methods for data collection such as surveys or data mining [19, 20] . Studies applied a number of theories to study factors affecting eWOM providing behaviour such as social exchange theory, motivational theory and Uses and Gratification theory to name a few [17] . Based on the literature review 21 factors which affect eWOM providing behaviour were identified (see Table 1 ). To determine the strength of the relationships between constructs, weight analysis was conducted by dividing the number of significant relationships by the total number of analysed relationships between studied independent and dependent variables. For example, the relationship between economic incentive and engaging in eWOM communications was examined 13 times and was significant eight times. As a result, the weight significance of a relationship between these two constructs is calculated by dividing 8 by 13, which gives 0.615. If weight is equal to 1 it indicates that the relationship between two constructs is significant across all studies, while a weight equal to 0 shows this relationship is non-significant throughout all examined studies (Jeyaraj et al. [39] ; Rana et al. [40] ). Table 2 presents the weight analysis of all 21 relationships included in this study.",

Although these relationships were found to be significant across all examined studies, Jeyaraj et al. [39] suggest that these types of experimental variables need more testing to be categorised as best predictors. Even though none of the studied relationships between predictors and intention to engage in eWOM was found to have a weight of '0', some of the well-utilised independent constructs are considered to be least effective predictors, such as influence of others (examined 6 times, significant 3 times), tie strength (examined 8 times, significant 4 times), information influence (examined 5 times, significant once), economic incentive (examined 13 times, significant 8 times), altruism (examined 9 times, significant 5 times), and customer satisfaction (examined 9 times, significant 5 times). It is proposed by Jeyaraj et al. [39] that justification for continuing to examine such predictors should be convincing. Nevertheless, it may be premature to exclude such predictors given that eWOM providing behaviour research is still emerging as far as the empirical aspects and solid theoretical foundations of this research are concerned. Out of the total 21 examined relationships only nine were found to be studied five or more times (influence of others, tie strength, information influence, economic incentive, altruism, involvement, self-enhancement, customer satisfaction, and trust in web eWOM services), which proposes that eWOM research is still not that well developed. Moreover, some researchers propose that weight analysis may not be a sufficient reason to exclude any variables from further analysis (Rana et al. [40] ). None of the predictors was found to be the worst predictors of intention to engage in eWOM communications.",

This can affect the number of research outputs available for weight analysis, the coverage and representativity of the sample considered in the analysis.
