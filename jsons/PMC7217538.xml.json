Infected individuals become spontaneously healed (susceptible) with rate \u03bc and transmit the disease to their susceptible contacts with rate \u03bb. In principle, the SIS dynamics can exhibit a phase transition between a disease-free (absorbing) state and an active stationary phase, in which the epidemics persists in an endemic state. The transition occurs at an epidemic threshold \u03bbc. However, for uncorrelated random networks with a power-law degree distribution P(k)\u223ck\u2212\u03b3, it was rigorously proved [5] and later put in sound physical grounds [11] that the absorbing phase is unstable in the thermodynamic limit implying that the epidemic threshold is formally zero.",

            "text": "Considering that both real and computationally generated networks are finite, the finite-size dependence of the epidemic variables is a fundamental issue. Analytically, it is frequently accessed by mean-field approximations that take into account the network heterogeneity but truncate at some level the dynamical correlations [8]. Two classes of mean-field theories are mostly used. The degree-based theory [20,21], termed as heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) [1,3], is a coarse-grained mixing approach, in which the vertex degree is the relevant quantity. This method is closely related to the annealed network regime where the connections are rewired in time scales much shorter than those of the dynamical processes taking place on the top of the network [4,22]. The individual-based theory [23\u201325], termed quenched mean-field (QMF) [7], considers the network structure without mixing using its adjacency matrix [1]. These theories predict equivalent epidemic thresholds of the SIS dynamics on uncorrelated random networks with power-law degree distribution of exponent 2<\u03b3<5/2 but are sharply conflicting for \u03b3>3\n[7], for which HMF predicts finite thresholds whereas QMF vanishing ones as N\u2192\u221e. The latter is asymptotically in agreement with the exact results [5,6] and supported by stochastic simulations [11,26,27]. For 5/2<\u03b3<3, both theories state a null threshold as N\u2192\u221e, but the way that the asymptotic value is approached and, thus, the effective finite-size thresholds are different. Improvements of these theories including dynamical correlations by means of pairwise approximations [8] do not change the foregoing scenarios [16,27,28].",

            "text": "Recently, a criterion formerly conceived for SIS model [11] was applied to determine the nature of epidemic thresholds of generic processes on networks with power-law degree distributions [12]. The criterion involves the recovering time \u03c4k of an epidemics on a star graph, consisting of a central vertex connected to k leaves of degree 1 that mimics the hubs of a network, and the time \u03c4(inf) that the hubs take to mutually transmit the infection to each other. If \u03c4k\u226b\u03c4(inf), hubs remain active for times sufficiently long to infect each other and the epidemics is triggered by the mutual activation of hubs, leading to a vanishing threshold in the thermodynamic limit. If \u03c4k\u2272\u03c4(inf), the mutual reinfection is knocked out and the transition to an endemic phase can only take place collectively involving a finite fraction of the network and happens at a finite threshold. In Ref. [12], this criterion notably predicted that waning immunity [29], in which infected individuals are temporarily immunized before to become susceptible, leads to a finite threshold for \u03b3>3 which disagrees with the prediction of QMF approximation, but in agreement with extensive numerical simulations.",

In the present work, we tackle this problem comparing slightly modified versions of the standard SIS model, preserving the spontaneous healing and infection capacity increasing proportionally to the vertex degree. All modified and original models have the same thresholds in both HMF and QMF theories. However, the criterion of mutual reinfection time of hubs [11,12] predicts a finite threshold in the thermodynamic limit for the modified models in uncorrelated networks [30] with \u03b3>3, in contrast with the standard SIS. Stochastic simulations [31] on large networks corroborate this prediction. For 5/2<\u03b3<3, we observed that the modified dynamics present a vanishing threshold in better agreement with HMF than QMF. For 2<\u03b3<5/2, the SIS infection mechanism is robust and all models have essentially the same epidemic threshold. This duality is explained in terms of epidemic activation mechanisms [9,12,32].",

First, the metastable, localized, and active states of the standard SIS dynamics necessary to sustain the endemic activity for any infection rate for \u03b3>3 are not universal and their realizations in real epidemic processes may be unrealistic. Second, for the widely more frequent case of networks with 2<\u03b3<3, the null threshold is a robust feature, obtained irrespectively of the existence of locally self-activated star subgraphs. In such an absence, epidemics is triggered in the innermost, densely connected component of the network given by a k-core decomposition [33], while for the original SIS model it happens only for 2<\u03b3<5/2\n[32]. Last but not least, the HMF theory [3,4,20], which has been frequently pretermitted due to its failure in capturing the asymptotically null epidemic threshold of the standard SIS for \u03b3>3\n[7,23,24], is more accurate than the QMF theory for the present modified SIS models and also in other models as contact processes [28] and SIRS [12].

The infected ones are spontaneously healed with rate \u03bc in all models. In the standard SIS, hereafter called SIS-S, an infected vertex infects each susceptible nearest-neighbor with rate \u03bb. In the SIS-T model, infection is a threshold process where susceptible vertices are infected with rate \u03bb if they have at least one infected nearest-neighbor.11This is an asynchronous version of the model investigated in seminal papers [20,34] dealing with epidemic spreading on networks. Finally, SIS-A is a modification of the contact process [35] where the infected vertices simultaneously infect all susceptible neighbors with rate \u03bb. The symbols S, T, and A make reference to standard, threshold, and all in the model definitions. The models rules and some details of their computer implementations described in Appendix A are summarized in Table I.\n",

However, there exists a difference in the threshold scaling for \u03b3=2.7 but does not for \u03b3=2.25. It has been claimed [9] that the most effective spreaders in an epidemic processes lie in a subset containing the innermost core of the networks identified by the maximal index of the k-core decomposition33A k-core decomposition consists of the following pruning process. Remove all vertices with degree ks=kmin plus their edges and all other vertices that possess a degree kmin after the removal until no more vertices of degree kmin appear in the process. Next, the procedure is repeated for all vertices of degree ks=kmin+1,kmin+2 and so on until all vertices are removed. The maximal k-core corresponds to the subset of vertices and edges removed in the last step of the decomposition.\n[22,33]. For SIS-S, this mechanism is claimed to hold for uncorrelated networks with \u03b3<5/2 but the case 5/2<\u03b3<3 has activation ruled by the hubs [32]. Since hubs cannot be activated in isolation for arbitrarily small \u03bb in SIS-A and SIS-T, we propose that the epidemic threshold should be ruled by the subgraph identified by the maximal k-core for the whole range of scale-free networks with 2<\u03b3<3.",

The same analysis holds in the not shown data for SIS-T. Therefore, the following framework can be drawn. For \u03b3=2.25, the k-core is activated first than hubs and the epidemic activation is triggered in the maximal k-core for all models. For \u03b3=2.7, the hubs are activated firstly for SIS-S while k-core is activated firstly in the other models such that the epidemic activation is due to hubs for the standard model and still k-core for the modified dynamics.\n",

The trimming of edges reduces the epidemic activity in the subset containing only the maximal k-core while the k-core mediates the mutual interactions among hubs in the activation driven by them. We see that a large fraction of the network is redundant for the epidemic threshold independently if hub (SIS-S) or k-core activation (SIS-A and T) is at work.

The standard SIS model, called SIS-S in this work, is an example that behaves very differently from most of other related processes. For example, while many fundamental models on random networks with a power-law degree distribution (susceptible infected recovered (SIR) model [58], Ising model [59,60], synchronization [61], etc.) have a finite order parameter for any value of the control parameter only for degree exponent \u03b3<3\n[3], this happens for any value of \u03b3 in SIS-S\n[5,7].

We investigated two slightly different versions of the standard SIS, termed SIS-A and SIS-T, in which the spontaneous healing and the unlimited infection capacity of a vertex are preserved. These alternative models present exactly the same thresholds of the SIS-S in both QMF and HMF theories. Stochastic simulations on uncorrelated synthetic networks, however, show a dual scenario where the three models have essentially the same vanishing thresholds for \u03b3<5/2 but disparate results are found for \u03b3>5/2. In particular, a finite threshold is observed for \u03b3>3 in both modified models, in contrast with the asymptotically null threshold of the standard case. This same framework was observed for SIRS model in Ref. [12], in which an individual acquires temporary immunity when the agents cannot neither transmit infection nor be infected. The dissonance is explained in terms of self-sustained, long-lived activation of hubs for any finite value of \u03bb\n[11] that holds for SIS-S but does not for the other models. The epidemic lifespan of hubs with the modified dynamics increases slowly (algebraically or logarithmically) with the hub degree in contrast with the exponential increase of the standard case. The last one permits the long-range mutual activation or reactivation of hubs [11,12].",

This approximation becomes more problematic for QMF since we explicitly reckon the interactions with the actual nearest-neighbors of each vertex and assume that their states are independent. The leading approximation in HMF is to assume that the probability to be infected depends only on the vertex degree, neglecting the local structure of the network. As an effect, HMF theory may not be able to capture localized activity due to specific motifs as those observed for star subgraphs in the SIS-S model. Finally, QMF theory is not a genuine mean-field approach since it does not present mixing of vertices while HMF does through the degree compartmentalization. Our results thus reinforces the belief that mean-field approaches with heterogeneous mixing are suitable approximations for most dynamical processes on networks with a small-world property, in which the average distance between vertices increases logarithmically with the system size [1].",

The summary presented in Table III suggests that the hub activation mechanism, intensively investigated recently [5,7,11\u201313,15,17,62,63], seems to be more a peculiarity than a rule in epidemic spreading. We expect that our results will guide the analysis of other classes of the dynamical process on networks such as the complex contagion models [64\u201367] where activation requires more than one interaction to be effected.",
