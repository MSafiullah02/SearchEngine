Although concerns, as occurred 41 with SARS-CoV 5,6 , that vaccines may cause disease enhancement will need to be addressed. 42 The feasibility of human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) as immunoprophylaxis or therapy 43 against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV 7-10 and MERS-CoV 11 has been demonstrated. These In the current study we describe the discovery of a cross-neutralizing human IgA monoclonal 68 antibody, MAb362 IgA. This IgA antibody binds to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with high affinity 69 directly competing at the hACE2 binding interface by blocking interactions with the receptor. 75 We have previously developed and characterized a panel of human MAbs that targets the RBD 76 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, isolated from transgenic mice expressing human 77 immunoglobulin genes 9,10 . These 36 hybridomas were recently screened against the SARS-CoV-78 2 Spike protein for potential cross-bind activity. MAb362 was identified with cross-binding 79 activity against both the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV S1-590 and SAR-CoV-2 S1-604 proteins 80 (Extended Data MAb362 IgG and IgA were assessed in ELISA binding assays against the receptor-binding 87 domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit for SARS-CoV S270-510 and SARS-CoV-2 S319-541 (Figure 1a ).",

Hybridoma supernatants were screened for reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Positive 367 cell clones were selected for antibody sequencing. The heavy chain and light chain variable regions were amplified from hybridoma cells and cloned into an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG) 369 expression vector. Isotype switching was conducted using primers designed to amplify the 370 variable heavy chain of the IgG antibody. Products were digested and ligated into a pcDNA 3.1 371 vector containing the heavy constant IgA1 chain. The vector was transformed in NEB5-\u03b1 372 competent cells, and sequences were verified ahead of transient transfection. IgG and IgA1 373 antibodies were transfected in Expi293 cells and purified as previously described 32 . For dimeric 374 IgA (dIgA), the heavy and light chain vectors were cotransfected with pcDNA-containing DNA 375 for the connecting J chain. Purified antibodies were dialyzed against PBS and then concentrated 376 and quality tested by SDS-PAGE.",

Pseudovirus was generated employing an HIV backbone that contained a mutation 404 to prevent HIV envelope glycoprotein expression and a luciferase gene to direct luciferase 405 expression in target cells (pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-, obtained from Dr. Nathaniel Landau, NIH). 406 SARS-S and SARS2-S spike protein was provided in trans by co-transfection of 293T cells with 407 pcDNA-G with pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-. Supernatant containing virus particles was harvested 48-72 h 408 post-transfection, concentrated using Centricon 70 concentrators, aliquoted and stored frozen at -409 80 degree. Before assessing antibody neutralization, the 293T cells were transient transfected 410 with 100ng pcDNA-hACE2 each well in 96 well plates, and the cells were used for the 411 pseudovirus infection 24 hours after transfection. A titration of pseudovirus was performed on 412 293T cells transiently transfected with hACE2 receptor to determine the volume of virus need to 413 generate 50,000 counts per second (cps) in the infection assay. The appropriate volume of pseudovirus was pre-incubated with varying concentrations of MAbs for 1 h at room temperature 415 before adding to 293T cells expressing hACE2. 24 hours after the infection, the pseudovirus was 416 replaced by the fresh complete media, and 24 hours after media changing the infection was 417 quantified by luciferase detection with BrightGlo luciferase assay (Promega) and read in a 418 Victor3 plate reader (Perkin Elmer) for light production.419 420 Structural modeling and analyses. 421 Three crystal structures, 2GHW the complex of 80R:SARS-CoV-RBD 23 , 2AJF the complex of 422 hACE2:SARS-CoV-RBD 34 and 6VW1 the complex of hACE2:SARS-CoV-2-RBD 22 were used 423 as initial scaffolds in the determinations of the models of MAb362:SARS-CoV-RBD and 424 MAb362:SARS-CoV-2-RBD. The amino acid sequence of MAb362 was aligned to the amino 425 acid sequences of 80R. The molecular modeling of MAb362 was performed through the 426 program Modeller 9.15 using the basic modeling and forming the initial MAb362:SARS-CoV 427 RBD complex. This structure was further refined using iterative energy minimization by 428 Desmond as previously described 35,36 . The MAb362:SARS-CoV-2-RBD complex was made by 429 replacing the SARS-CoV-2-RBD from 2AJF on the SARS-CoV-RBD structure and further 430 optimized. The structural model of MAb362 binds to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer was based 431 on 6VYB 30 . All figures were made within the PyMOL package. Hydrogen bonds were 432 determined for pairs of eligible donor/acceptor atoms using criteria set by Schrodinger 433 (Schrodinger, LLC, The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3r1. 2010.). The residue 434van der Waals potential between the various complexes was extracted from the structures 435 energies using the energy potential within Desmond.
