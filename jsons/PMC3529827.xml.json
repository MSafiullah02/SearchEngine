For instance, children hospitalized with HRV/EV in this study were on average 4.2 years younger than those with influenza virus. This is likely due to the uniquely high reported age of children hospitalized with the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, which at our institution had a reported median age of 6 years compared to 2008 when the median age of those hospitalized with influenza was 1.8 years.14 During a typical influenza season, patients with HRV/EV would be expected to be the same age or slightly older than those with influenza virus.",

It is possible that some patients had a positive RVP result due to prolonged shedding from a prior unrelated infection or asymptomatic carriage of virus with signs and symptoms due to another disease process or infectious agent. By excluding patients with bacterial and viral co-infections from the study, we limited this effect as much as possible. With regards to viral shedding, early studies that did not type individual rhinoviruses suggested that rhinovirus RNA can persist in nasal secretions up to 5\u20136 weeks, in comparison to a median of 6 days for 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus in children.17, 18 However more recent studies that included typing have found that the RNA of individual rhinoviruses typically persists for less than 2 weeks, with sequential infections due to the same or different rhinovirus types giving the appearance of prolonged shedding.19, 20 Rhinovirus RNA has been identified in up to 15% of asymptomatic children,21 whereas influenza virus infection is rarely asymptomatic. Given the longer shedding and asymptomatic carriage of rhinoviruses, the effect of incidental detection of viral RNA may have disproportionately increased the prevalence of HRV/EVs compared to influenza virus.",
