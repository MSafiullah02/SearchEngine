The large number of asthma exacerbations each year and significant morbidity due to asthma highlight the need for increased understanding of the mechanisms and pathways that generate the asthma phenotype [2]. The contribution of infections to the occurrence of asthma exacerbations has been of broad interest for at least the last 100 years since William Osler remarked with respect to asthma that \u201cevery fresh cold\u201d could induce a paroxysm of disease [3]. Epidemiologic and cohort studies have also increased our understanding of the role that viral infections contribute to asthma inception in the past 20 years. With the advent of highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing techniques, diagnostic yields have increased and new viruses have been discovered that impact asthma pathogenesis. These findings have altered our understanding of the relative contributions of different viruses to the acute exacerbation of asthma and the development of asthma.",

            "text": "Evidence implicating influenza as a significant cause of morbidity in asthmatic patients primarily comes from studies assessing medical care utilization. Several investigators have associated influenza with increased medical care utilization by patients with asthma. In both adults and children with chronic underlying medical conditions (the majority of which were asthma), a substantial proportion of hospitalizations were linked to influenza seroconversion [5]. In a Medicaid database of children under the age of 15 years, children aged 1\u20133 years with asthma had significantly increased acute cardiopulmonary hospitalization rates (defined as hospitalization due to pneumonia, influenza, acute respiratory tract infection, heart failure, or myocarditis), outpatient visits, and antibiotic courses during influenza season compared to a predefined peri-influenza season [10]. Children aged 3\u201315 years with asthma did not demonstrate a significant increase in hospitalization rates due to acute cardiopulmonary disease during influenza season. However, rates of outpatient visits and antibiotic courses were markedly increased in this age group [10]. In a similar study, children with medical conditions placing them at high risk of complications from influenza \u2013 in whom asthma accounted for an average of 79% of the high-risk medical conditions per year \u2013 had increased incidence of hospitalization and outpatient visits compared with otherwise healthy patients during influenza season [11]. These studies are limited by retrospective assessment as well as reliance on diagnostic codes and virus-seasonality determinations to define influenza-attributable rates for their variables of interest. Diagnosis of asthma in children under 2 years of age is often difficult given the frequency with which recurrent wheezing occurs in the absence of atopy in this age group. In spite of these limitations, the studies suggest that asthmatic patients are at risk for significant morbidity related to influenza infection.",

            "text": "Prospective population-based surveillance has confirmed the above association between asthma and increased influenza-attributable hospitalization rates and outpatient clinic visits. From 2000 to 2004, children aged 6\u201359 months were prospectively assessed when presenting in either the inpatient (over four consecutive seasons) or outpatient (over two consecutive seasons) setting with acute respiratory illnesses or fever [12]. Influenza infection was defined as a viral culture or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for influenza A or B from nasal or throat swabs obtained at enrollment. Asthma was defined by parental report with systematic medical record review and discharge diagnosis code review. In this population, children aged 6\u201323 months with asthma had a significantly higher influenza-attributable hospitalization rate than did healthy children of the same age group (2.8 vs. 0.6 cases per 1000 children; p\n < 0.05). Children aged 24\u201359 months did not have a significantly different hospitalization rate. Outpatient surveillance during the 2003\u20132004 season identified higher influenza-attributable outpatient visits for both the 6\u201323 month age (316 cases per 1000 children) and the 24\u201359 month age groups (188 cases per 1000 children) vs. healthy children (152 and 102 cases per 1000 children respectively by age group). This pattern was not seen in the 2002\u20132003 season. These findings along with the preceding retrospective studies indicate a role for influenza in increased health care utilization in asthmatic patients in younger age groups and suggest an important role for influenza vaccination in preventing this morbidity.",

An observational case\u2013control study of 142 children aged 2\u20135 years with persistent asthma compared viral detection in children with asthma exacerbation with viral detection in children with well-controlled asthma [13]. Influenza was not detected in either group during the year of this study. In a study aimed primarily at evaluating human bocavirus (HBoV) in children aged 3 months to 15 years (median: 1.6 years) with acute wheezing, influenza was detected in 3% of 259 children with acute wheezing. In only one of these cases was influenza identified as the sole virus detected from the specimen [14]. In contrast, the two most frequently isolated viruses \u2013 RSV and rhinvovirus \u2013 were each identified in 28% of children. In a study of human rhinovirus (HRV) in children hospitalized for asthma exacerbation, influenza was co-detected with HRV in 2.4% of children [15]. In another study of 128 children aged 2\u201316 years with a prior diagnosis of asthma and presenting for acute asthma exacerbation, only one child had influenza detected from an isolate that was also positive for HRV and metapneumovirus [16]. Finally, in 40 patients with acute asthma exacerbation who were part of a larger study of viruses in acute wheezing, 8% of patients had influenza detected, all of which were co-detections with additional respiratory viruses [17]. These studies were performed primarily, if not exclusively, using inpatients and collectively suggest that influenza is not a significant cause of asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalization.",

Viral detection was performed by direct immunofluorescence and viral culture.

Three-hundred thirty-nine patients were included in the study, 68.5% of whom were hospitalized and 31.5% of whom were discharged from the ED.

This study was limited by its use of self-control analysis in which rates of asthma exacerbation before and after influenza vaccination were compared on an individual basis. A more recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of inactivated influenza vaccination in children age 6\u201318 years with asthma was performed in the Netherlands [21].

Two of these studies noted that the prevalence of asthma in patients infected with 2009 H1N1 influenza A was increased over that noted in historical controls infected with influenza A (41% vs. 20%, p\n < 0.001; and 22% vs. 6%, p\n < 0.001) [22], [23]. An association of asthma diagnosis with markers of illness severity such as hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality in 2009 H1N1 influenza A infected patients has also been found [23], [24], [25]. In an evaluation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of mortality from 2009 H1N1 influenza, the American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) population had 3 times the mortality from influenza than did other groups. Of patients who died from their infection, 31% of AI/AN patients had a diagnosis of asthma whereas only 14.1% of other groups had been previously diagnosed with asthma [26]. While these data are limited by their use of historical controls and small sample sizes, they do suggest increased severity of novel influenza virus infection in patients with asthma and emphasize the importance of vigilance in distribution of influenza vaccine to asthmatic patients.",

Lower respiratory tract infections with HRV in people with asthma are more severe and longer lasting than in people unaffected by asthma [43]. Several recent studies have confirmed and extended these prior findings. A case\u2013control study of children aged 2\u201317 years with asthma exacerbation or with well-controlled asthma was performed using age and seasonal matching of cases and controls. HRV was the most prevalent virus in asthma exacerbation (60% in cases vs. 18.2% in controls) and was the only virus significantly associated with asthma exacerbations (OR, 6.8; 95% CI, 3.2\u201314.3) [13]. This association was stronger for symptomatic infections and led the authors to conclude that HRV infections could account for as many as 30% of asthma exacerbations in children. Similar findings were recently demonstrated in children aged 3\u201318 years with asthma exacerbation in Hong Kong (OR for asthma exacerbation with positive HRV detection, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.09\u20135.32) [44]. In both of these studies the majority of patients with acute asthma exacerbation were hospitalized (72% [13] and 97% [44]). In an outpatient pilot study assessing HRV point prevalence in acute asthma exacerbations, HRV was detected in 52.6% of naspharyngeal aspirate specimens [19]. A study performed in the Carribbean noted the association of HRV infection with acute asthma exacerbation in a season-independent manner [45]. Thus, HRV detection continues to be well associated with both severe and non-severe asthma exacerbation in outpatient and inpatient settings.",

One recent study has suggested that HRV may be the cause of this temporal epidemic. A Canadian group prospectively evaluated viral etiologies in a case\u2013control study of children age 5\u201315 years presenting to the emergency department with acute asthma exacerbation compared to age and asthma severity matched controls without acute exacerbation [51]. To focus on this early fall period the study was limited to recruitment in September. Viruses were detected in 62% of cases and 41% of controls (p\n = 0.011) with human picornaviruses detected in 52% of cases and 29% of controls (p\n = 0.002).

Using prospective viral surveillance over 5-week periods in 58 asthmatic children during September and April in two consecutive years, 72\u201399% of detected viruses were HRV [52]. Virus detection was associated with increased duration and severity of asthma symptoms. Although no difference in viral detection was noted between sensitized and non-sensitized children, those sensitized to at least one allergen had more symptomatic virus-associated illnesses per season. Moreover, viral infections in these children were significantly more likely to cause moderate or severe asthma symptoms than in non-sensitized children (Fig. 2\n) [52]. These findings support a hypothesis that prior allergen sensitization and viral infection act in concert to increase risk for acute asthma exacerbations [53].",

Children less than 5 years of age were prospectively identified through the NVSN upon presentation with ARI/F over the span of 2 years [15]. Nasal and throat swabs were obtained, RT-PCR was performed on HRV-positive samples to amplify a specific portion of the viral protein 4/viral protein 2 region, and sequences were evaluated to determine HRV grouping of each isolate. HRVC comprised 46% of HRVs detected. Children in whom HRVC was detected were more likely to be high-risk as defined by ACIP, with the majority of high-risk conditions being asthma, and more likely to have a discharge diagnosis of asthma than children in whom HRVA or HRVB were detected [15]. Prospective study performed in Jordan found an association between HRVC and parental report of wheezing [56]. Retesting of samples from a previously published study of viral respiratory tract infections in children with asthma noted a significant association between acute asthma exacerbation and HRVC detection [13], [57].",

Two-hundred seventy-five patients were available at 3 years of age for follow up [60]. At that age, patients with a preceding moderate to severe respiratory illness had increased risk of continued wheezing at 3 years of age when all viral etiologies were evaluated together regardless of whether or not wheezing was present during the original illness. The strongest relationship was noted with HRV infection in infancy (OR for wheezing at 3 years, 2.3 with wheezing-negative RV illness in infancy; OR, 10 with wheezing-positive RV illness in infancy) [60]. These findings were independent of the number of infections in infancy.",

Using database information and ICD-9 codes the authors identified children in the first year of life with no health care visit for bronchiolitis and those with a first visit for bronchiolitis [63]. Children were classified on the basis of whether this first bronchiolitis visit occurred during a winter virus season (November\u2013April or December\u2013February) or during a non-winter virus season (May\u2013October or August and September). The narrower time frames were used to select for a primarily RSV season (December\u2013February) or a primarily HRV season (August and September). Similar to the findings in the above studies, the risk of eventual development of asthma was significantly higher in the children with bronchiolitis during the non-winter virus season (RR, 2.22; 95% CI, 2.08\u20132.38) than in those children with bronchiolitis during the winter virus season (RR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.86\u20132.03) when compared to children who did not have bronchiolitis in the first year of life. When compared directly, children with bronchiolitis in the HRV specific season were significantly more likely to develop asthma at the age of 4\u20135.5 years than those who had bronchiolitis during the RSV specific season (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13\u20131.38). Based on the seasonal differences in emergence of RSV and HRV, the authors conclude that this effect of bronchiolitis season on asthma development suggests a stronger role for HRV than RSV in eventual development of asthma. Although these findings are limited by the lack of viral detection and the possible misclassification of illness, these limitations would likely lead to underestimation of the effect rather than overestimation. Taken together, the above studies support an association between the occurrence of RV lower respiratory tract illness in infancy and the eventual development of asthma, an association that appears to be stronger for RV than for RSV.",

Patients in this study ranged from 3 months to 16 years of age (61% with diagnosis of bronchiolitis; 39% acute asthma) [70].

Although this study did not specifically address asthma exacerbations, its findings provide insight into the relevance of HBoV detection in respiratory illness and have implications for study of HBoV and asthma. In this evaluation, 119 children between the ages of 6 and 24 months were prospectively enrolled if they attended one of three daycares for 20 h or more per week. Nasal swab samples were obtained at study enrollment and then with every respiratory illness for up to 2 years. Surveillance was performed both passively (parent or daycare staff contacted study staff with new or worsening illness in a child) and actively (by on-site study nurse). Illness symptoms were assessed by both study nurse interview of parents and by daily symptom diaries completed by parents. Comprehensive testing of nasal samples for 14 respiratory viruses was performed by PCR with testing for HBoV DNA performed retrospectively. Samples were obtained once weekly in a child until the sample was negative for all viruses and the child was symptomatically improving. Several findings of this study point to a lack of association between HBoV detection and the presence of respiratory illness. While HBoV was second only to RV in frequency of detection in this study (106 of 318 study illnesses), the rate of co-detection was high with 72% of HBoV-positive illnesses having one or more other viruses detected. Detection of HBoV was not strongly associated with illness onset or with symptomatology by several markers. At study enrollment, HBoV was detected in samples from 44% of asymptomatic enrollees and there was no significant difference in detection between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at enrollment. In 21% of HBoV-positive illnesses the initial detection of HBoV occurred at or after the second week of illness symptoms. Furthermore, in 20 \u2018shedding events\u2019 with HBoV detected repeatedly in individual patients, HBoV detection spanned the occurrence and resolution of multiple respiratory illnesses. Finally, there was no difference in viral load of HBoV between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The findings of this study argue against an important role for HBoV in the pathogenesis of respiratory illnesses, and by extension, asthma.",

In spite of the numerous studies directed at evaluating this relationship over the past 30 years, debate continues over whether RSV bronchiolitis in infancy causes an aberrant immune response resulting in development of asthma or is rather a marker of underlying genetic predisposition to the eventual development of asthma. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, a prospective birth cohort, defined that a subset of infants with early childhood wheezing develop persistent wheezing episodes later in life and that a family history of asthma is a risk factor for this persistent wheezing [84]. Both the frequency of RSV infection in infancy and the recognition in this study that many episodes of bronchiolitis and wheezing in infancy were caused by RSV [85] led to further intensive evaluations of the relationship between RSV infection in infancy and the development of asthma [86], [87]. Recent studies designed to evaluate the nature and direction of this association are listed in Table 5\n. Several large prospective cohort and retrospective database studies have informed the debate over a causal role for RSV in asthma development. In this section we will review more recent studies from these groups in light of their prior contributions.",

            "text": "In 1995 a group from Boras, Sweden published the first in a series of studies evaluating the prevalence of asthma following episodes of RSV bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization in infants [88]. Their original cohort consisted of 47 RSV-infected infants with a mean age of 3.5 months and 93 date-of-birth, sex, and residence-matched control infants. Subsequent studies have indicated increased risk of asthma and allergic sensitization in the RSV-infected infants at 3, 7\u00bd, and 13 years with 28% of children in the RSV group carrying a current diagnosis of asthma at 13 years of age (RR, 8.7; p\n < 0.001) compared to the control group [87], [88], [89]. Follow up information from this group at 18 years of age has recently been published [90]. At this time point, 46 of the original 47 RSV-infected subjects and 92 of the 93 control subjects were available for study. Importantly, RSV-infected and control groups did not have significant differences in family history of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis. As previously noted, the RSV-infected cohort had increased prevalence of current asthma (33% vs. 7%, p\n < 0.001) and allergic sensitization defined by skin-prick testing (33% vs. 11%, p\n = 0.005) compared to the control cohort [90]. The authors evaluated multiple risk factors for current asthma using multivariate logistic regression and determined that only prior RSV (OR, 7.2) and current allergic rhinoconjuncitivitis (OR, 4.4) were significant independent risk factors for current asthma. While the power in the study was inadequate to specifically assess the effect of differences in parental history of asthma in the RSV group on current diagnosis of asthma, a significant trend was noted for the combined effect of both RSV and parental asthma history on current asthma and allergic sensitization. This study provides interesting information regarding the persistence of asthma following RSV bronchiolitis into early-adulthood and suggests that the effect may be more prolonged than previously noted. A similar persistence of asthma has also been found in a cohort of children with RSV bronchiolitis prior to the age of 2 years [91].",

Using information from health care visits, pharmacy data, and demographic data available through these databases, investigators have evaluated the relationship between winter virus infection and asthma [63], [92], [93]. In an earlier study using this database, this group determined an association between infant birth timing in relationship to winter virus season and the development of childhood asthma between 3.5 and 5 years of age [92]. Weekly frequencies of bronchiolitis hospitalizations were used to determine the \u2018winter virus peak\u2019 during the time period of the study. Using this data, the authors found that infant birth timing with regard to winter virus peak was predictive of infants developing bronchiolitis with the peak risk of bronchiolitis at 122 days of age. Timing of infant birth was also predictive of development of childhood asthma with children 121 days of age having the highest risk. Children at this age had a statistically significant increase in likelihood of developing asthma compared to those infants born 12 months prior to peak winter virus time (adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.19\u20131.40). This relationship held when other possible interactions were taken into account (smoking during pregnancy, maternal asthma, infant race, gender, birth weight, gestational age, living siblings, region of residence, and maternal education). The authors point out that a purely genetic effect in the development of asthma while still allowing a seasonal development of bronchiolitis in these infants would not result in a seasonal effect on asthma.",

Severity of bronchilitis was determined by the location at which a patient received care for their illness (outpatient visit, emergency department visit, hospital stay). Patients with increased level of care associated with an asthma ICD-9 code had significantly increased risk of asthma development (OR, 1.86, 2.41, and 2.28, for outpatient, emergency department, and hospitalization, respectively) compared to children without any medical visit for bronchiolitis. This relationship was noted whether a familial predisposition to asthma, defined by presence of maternal asthma, was present. While this study does not establish causality, the relationship between bronchiolitis severity and asthma development and the persistence of this effect independent of maternal history of asthma is suggestive of a role for viral infection in the development of asthma that is distinct from genetic contributions to risk.",

Previously, these investigators evaluated the associations between RSV and asthma in a bidirectional manner. Using the twin registry, they found that while the occurrence of RSV bronchiolitis did result in increased risk of subsequent asthma, this increased risk was time-dependent and decreased significantly over the following 1\u20132 years. Looking at the opposite direction, the occurrence of asthma (defined from the registry as asthma-related hospitalization or asthma-related corticosteroid use) was associated with an increased risk of subsequent RSV bronchiolitis that remained significant over time [95]. Although the authors speculated that these findings are accounted for by a predisposition to severe RSV infection in asthmatics, it is important to note that the majority of asthma diagnoses and corticosteroid use in their study occurred in the first 2 years of life when transient early wheeze is a frequent occurrence that does not necessarily represent asthma.",

While limited by a small sample size of 37 twin-pairs, these results contradict those of the TABS group in which increased severity of bronchiolitis resulted in increased risk of asthma, and instead support the critical role of genetic factors in predisposition to asthma. Additional investigation by this group has reported a genetic effect on occurrence of severe RSV and the age of diagnosis of asthma and further determined that a model in which asthma \u2018caused\u2019 RSV hospitalization fit the twin registry data better and with statistical significance than did a model in which RSV hospitalization \u2018caused\u2019 asthma [96], [97], [98].",

Early studies defined that as many as 14% of children admitted with LRTI due to hMPV were diagnosed with asthma exacerbation [101]. Other studies have supported this observation when investigating children under 5 years [102], [103], [104]. When including children aged 2\u201317 years, hMPV was however not associated with asthma exacerbation [13]. hMPV also appears to play an etiologic role in asthma exacerbation in adults [105]. More recently prospective surveillance by the NVSN of hospitalized children under the age of 5 years with acute respiratory infection or fever documented population-based incidence rates for hMPV in this age group [99]. Peak incidence rates occurred in the 0\u20135 month (4.9 infections/1000 children) and 6\u201311 month (2.9 infections//1000 children) age groups with overall incidence of 1.2 infections//1000 children 0\u20135 years of age [99]. Finally, few studies have evaluated the role of hMPV in development of asthma. In the sole study directed primarily at this question, the occurrence of hMPV bronchiolitis under 2 years of age was significantly associated with asthma diagnosis between the ages of 3 and 5 years (OR for asthma diagnosis, 15.9 for hMPV). In this study the association of hMPV and asthma diagnosis actually exceeded that seen for RSV bronchiolitis (OR, 10.1) [106].",

From the available evidence, the development of asthma emerges from a complex interaction of genetic predisposition and environmental factors with viral infection likely playing a significant role in the effect of environment on asthma inception. The discovery of new viruses such as HRVC and human bocavirus continue to provide intriguing avenues for further research into the relationship of viruses to asthma. Continued evaluation of this interaction with epidemiologic investigation, cohort studies, animal models, and in vitro evaluation is required to gain new insights and answers to these issues.",
