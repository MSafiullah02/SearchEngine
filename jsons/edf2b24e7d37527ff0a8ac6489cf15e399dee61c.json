Truth discovery models estimate source reliability and infer information trustworthiness simultaneously in a mutual reinforcement manner, and can be used to distinguish trustworthy comments with no supervision. However, they do not capture the diversity of word expressions and learn a single reliability score for the user. CrowdQM addresses these limitations by modeling the fine-grained aspect-level reliability of users and incorporate semantic similarity between words to learn a latent trustworthy comment embedding. We apply our latent trustworthy comment for comment ranking for three diverse communities in Reddit and show consistent improvement over non-aspect based approaches. We also show qualitative results on learned reliability scores and word embeddings by our model.",

This misinformation could lead to severe consequences, especially in health-related forums, that outweigh the positive benefits of these communities.

Intuitively, a user's reliability will be limited to only a few topics, for instance, in a science forum, a biologist could be highly knowledgeable, and in turn reliable, when she answers biology or chemistry-related questions but may not be competent enough for linguistic queries.",

We learn a trustworthy comment embedding for each post, such that it is semantically similar to comments of reliable users on the post and also similar to the post's context.

Each term, \u03c9 \u2208 V has a corresponding word-vector representation, or word embedding, v \u03c9 \u2208 R D . Thus, we can represent a post embeddings in terms of its constituent terms, {v c }, \u2200c \u2208 c m . To capture the semantic meaning, we represent each comment as the mean word-vector representation of their constituent terms 1 . Formally, we represent the comment given on the post m by user n as the comment embeddings, a m,n = |w m,n | There are K aspects or topics discussed in the forum, and each post and comment can be composed of multiple aspects. We denote submission m's distribution over these aspects as the post-aspect distribution, p m \u2208 R K . Similarly, we also compute, user-aspect distribution, u n \u2208 R K , learned over all the comments posted by the user n in the forum. This distribution captures familiarity (or frequency) of user n with each aspect based on their activity in the forum. Each user n also has a user reliability vector defined over K aspects, r n \u2208 R K . The reliability captures the likelihood of the user providing a trustworthy comment about a specific aspect.

This improvement is because our model updates word embeddings in a trust aware manner such that they are similar to terms used in responses from reliable users.",

            "text": "Truth Discovery: Truth discovery has attracted much attention recently. Different approaches have been proposed to address different scenarios [13, 20, 29] . Most of the truth discovery approaches are tailored to categorical data and thus assume there is a single objective truth that can be derived from the claims of different sources [15] . Faitcrowd [17] assumes an objective truth in the answer set and uses a probabilistic generative model to perform fine-grained truth discovery. On the other hand, Wan et al. [22] propose trustworthy opinion discovery where the true value of an entity is modeled as a random variable with a probability density function instead of a single value. However, it still fails to capture the semantic similarity between the textual responses. Some truth discovery approaches also leverage text data to identify correct responses effectively. Li et al. [14] proposed a model for capturing semantic meanings of crowd provided diagnosis in a Chinese medical forum. Zhang et al. [27] also leveraged semantic representation of answers and proposed a Bayesian approach to capture the multifactorial property of text answers. These approaches only use certain keywords to represent each answer and are thus, limited in their scope. Also, they learn a scalar user reliability score. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no work that models both fine-grained user reliability with semantic representations of the text to discover trustworthy comments from community responses.",

Most of the previous work can be categorized into feature-based or text relevance-based approaches. Feature-driven models [1, 5, 9] extract content or user based features that are fed into classifiers to identify the best comment. CQARank leverages voting information as well as user history and estimates user interests and expertise on different topics [25] . Barron-Cedeno et al. [2] also look at the relationship between the answers, measuring textual and structural similarities between them to classify useful and relevant answers. Text-based deep learning models learn an optimal representation of question and answer pairs to identify the most relevant answer [24] . In SemEval 2017 task on CQA, Nakov et al. [21] developed a task to recommend related answers to a new question in the forum. SemEval 2019 further extends this line of work by proposing fact checking in community question answering [18] . It is not only expensive to curate each reply manually to train these models, but also unsustainable. On the contrary, CrowdQM is an unsupervised method and thus does not require any labeled data. Also, we estimate the comments' trustworthiness that implicitly assumes relevance to the post (modeled by these works).",

The learned embedding can be further used to rank the comments for that post. We explored Reddit, a novel community discussion forum dataset for this task. Reddit is challenging as posts typically receive a large number of responses from a diverse set of users and each user engages in a wide range of topics. Our model estimates aspect-level user reliability and semantic representation of each comment simultaneously. Experiments show that modeling aspect level user reliability improves the prediction performance compared to the non-aspect version of our model. We also show that the estimated user-post reliability can be used to identify trustworthy users for particular post categories.",
