This is not unexpected, because HRV is the most common respiratory pathogen in otherwise healthy adults [18]. The presence of HRV among healthy controls may be explained by asymptomatic infection or prolonged viral shedding, both of which are common to HRV [19, 20]. HRV is commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, but among vulnerable populations, such as infants, young children [14], and elderly individuals, infection with HRV may involve the lower respiratory tract [21]. It is interesting to note that a number of women with detectable HRV reported symptoms consistent with lower respiratory tract infection.",

Because fever was not an inclusion criterion for this study, we were able to capture a range of respiratory illnesses, as well as respiratory viruses not commonly associated with fever. A little over one third of cases were classified as having ALRTI. While chest pain and decreased activity were significantly associated with ALRTI, history of fever was not. Over half of cases with ALRTI without fever did not have any detectable respiratory pathogen. It is possible that the individuals developed secondary infections due to pathogens for which we did not test. For febrile ALRTI, the most common viruses were influenza virus and RSV. Although infection with influenza virus has been associated with poor pregnancy outcomes [9], complications in pregnancy were uncommon in our study.",

During the 2016\u20132017 influenza season, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2013led study found that 53.6% of pregnant women had received a seasonal influenza vaccine [22]. Similarly, a 2015 national surveillance study reported maternal Tdap coverage to be 54% [23]. Many women in the study were not yet in the recommended time frame to receive Tdap.

When stratified with respect to a history of allergies, those with a history of allergies more frequently developed ALRTI, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, detection of respiratory pathogens was similar among cases with and those without a history of allergies. Among children, infection with HRV or RSV has been associated with the development of long-term wheeze and asthma [24, 25]. The reason for this association is possibly related to childhood sensitization to a respiratory virus that exacerbates later infections [26]. Children with detectable HRV and a positive result of an immunoallergy assay are more likely to develop a subsequent wheeze [18, 27]. Similar studies in adults have found a relationship between exposure to indoor allergens, detection of respiratory viruses, and hospitalization with asthma [28]. It is possible that a similar mechanism is at work for the pregnant women in our study.",

As a single-site study that enrolled participants during 1 respiratory season (October through May), our population size was limited, and our study cohort might not be comparable to patients at other obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Also, because the study was powered to capture a 10% frequency for RSV, less frequent respiratory viruses may not have been captured. Additionally, we did not capture the impact of viruses with summer seasonality. Because we only enrolled pregnant women seen at a clinic, compared with those at an emergency care facility, we were less likely to capture individuals with severe disease. However, this ambulatory study could have captured more individuals with ARI than those seen in an emergency center. Because some patients were enrolled later during their illness course, it is possible that the infecting virus was no longer present, resulting in a false-negative test result.",
