It was not, as far as the magnitude of the event, a major epidemic: 8096 and 774 people are known to have been infected and killed by SARS, respectively. However, the amount of media coverage garnered by this event was colossal. For example, in Britain, a study found that 3 tabloids and 2 broadsheets ran a total of 1153 news stories mentioning SARS from March to July 2003 [27]; the New Zealand Herald ran 261 articles from March 13 to June 11, 2003 [28]. In fact, media coverage of health related events has become so important that several surveillance systems now rely on active trolling of Internet news media and blogs to detect emerging disease threats [8], [19].",

Media coverage of an infectious outbreak can be seen as following two major routes. The first route is when the media report directly to the public on facts that they (the media) observe; the second has public health authorities using mass media or the Internet to communicate about the outbreak [1]. Because information is widely available and that it is difficult for public health authorities to arrange a permanent flow of information, it is frequent that during a crisis, the media try to create \u2018value\u2019 from very sparse information, thus following the first route rather than the second. This can be detrimental. For example, a study conducted after the SARS outbreak shows that students from Ontario, Canada were aware that the risk of becoming infected by the SARS coronavirus was low, but they also predominantly had misconceptions about the virus [5]. It is therefore important for public health authorities to communicate accurate and timely information to the public about infectious disease outbreaks. Communication is also extremely important in determining vaccine uptake [13], [21], [22].",

Xiao and Ruan [29] formulated an SIR (susceptible, infectious and recovered) model and proposed a non-linear incidence rate(1.1)g(I)S=kSI1+\u03b1I2,to describe the effect of mass media coverage. They showed that in this case, media coverage did not have any obvious effect on disease dynamics. Liu et al. [18] emphasized media impact in an EIH model, where H denotes hospitalized individuals, and assumed a transmission coefficient of the form(1.2)\u03b20=\u03b2e-\u03b11E-\u03b12I-\u03b13H.Possible multiple outbreaks and even sustained periodic oscillations of the infection were found. Zhu et al. [10] used a similar function as (1.2) and studied an SIR model. Numerical simulations in [10] suggested that the media impact was stronger when the basic reproduction number R0>1, and the model exhibited multiple endemic equilibria. Cui et al. [11] presented an SIS epidemic model incorporating media coverage and held the contact rate to be a function of the number of infectives in the population of the form(1.3)c(I)=c1-c2f(I).They observed a classic threshold-type behavior, with the disease becoming extinct when R0<1 and going to a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium when R0>1. They concluded that media coverage was critical in disease eradication.",

            "text": "All the mathematical models referenced above assume that space is homogeneous and investigations are confined to a population. However, infectious diseases spread geographically over time. For example, West Nile virus arrived in New York in the late 1990s and later on spread all the way to the west coast of North America. People also travel more frequently, which no doubt speeds up disease transmission through transportation. Two illustrations are SARS spreading from China to the rest of the world in 2002\u20132003 and Swine Flu (pH1N1) from Mexico to other countries in the world in 2009 [16]. Therefore, incorporating spatial heterogeneity in epidemic models is important (see, e.g. [2], [3], [4] and the references therein). The question we ask here is the following: does the addition of space perturb the results previously obtained? In the case of classical epidemic models, it is generally true that the addition of space by means of linearly interconnected patches does not lead to a change of behavior. However, restricting contacts when the incidence rises introduces effects that could lead to differences with the classical cases. We show here that such is not the case and that, at least in the model considered, which is a modification of [11], the addition of space is inconsequential as far as the dynamics is concerned.",

The reporting by media is assumed to be an increasing function of the number of infectious cases present in a patch, and as a consequence, the contact rate between susceptible and infectious individuals there is a decreasing function of the number of infectious cases present.

The positive orthant\nR+4\nis invariant under the flow of\n(2.3a), (2.3b), (2.3c), (2.3d), with\nSi(i=1,2)\nremaining positive. The total population within each patch converges to a steady state as\nt\u2192\u221e\nand solutions are bounded.\n\nProofUnder initial conditions (2.4), if for instance I1 becomes zero at some time t1 before I2 becomes zero, then from (2.3b), dI1/dt=m21I2\u2a7e0 at t1, which shows that I1 is a non-decreasing function of t at t1. Hence, I1 stays non-negative. Similarly, so does I2. Suppose now that at some time t2,S1(t2)=0 before S2 goes to zero. Then at t=t2, from (2.3a), (2.3b), (2.3c), (2.3d), dS1/dt=\u039b1+m21S2+\u03b31I1>0, which implies that dS1/dt>0 when S1 is positive and small. Thus, there is no time t2 such that S1(t2)=0. Therefore, S1 stays positive for t>0 when the initial condition S1(0)>0. By a similar argument, we obtain the positivity of S2.From system (2.3a), (2.3b), (2.3c), (2.3d), the differential equations governing the evolution of N1 and N2 are(3.1a)dN1dt=\u039b1-(m12+d1)N1+m21N2,\n(3.1b)dN2dt=\u039b2+m12N1-(m21+d2)N2.A simple calculation shows that the positive equilibrium (N1\u2217,N2\u2217) is the unique equilibrium of (3.1a), (3.1b) and is a stable node, with(3.2a)N1\u2217=\u039b1(d2+m21)+\u039b2m21m12d2+m21d1+d1d2,\n(3.2b)N2\u2217=\u039b2(d1+m12)+\u039b1m12m12d2+m21d1+d1d2.Since the positive orthant R+4 is invariant under (2.3a), (2.3b), (2.3c), (2.3d) and that the total population is bounded, the individual components are also bounded. \u25a1\n",

Following the next generation matrix method [12], [26] for deterministic compartmental models, we calculate the basic reproduction number R0 at E0.

It follows from (3.9a), (3.9b) that \u03d51I\u00af1\u2217,\u03d52I\u00af2\u2217>0. Moreover, \u03d51(I1)>0 and dg1(I1)dI1>0, if I\u00af1\u2217\u2a7dI1\u2a7dN1\u2217. Then there is no such equilibrium as I^1\u2217,I^2\u2217, such that I^1\u2217>I\u00af1\u2217 and I^2\u2217<I\u00af2\u2217, namely, if I^1\u2217>I\u00af1\u2217, then I^2\u2217>I\u00af2\u2217. Therefore, \u03d52(I2)>0 and dg2(I2)dI2>0, if I\u00af2\u2217\u2a7dI2\u2a7dN2\u2217. Thus, the following inequality holds.(3.11)dg1(I1)dI1dg2(I2)dI2=1m21d\u03d51(I1)dI1I1+\u03d51(I1)1m12d\u03d52(I2)dI2I2+\u03d52(I2)>1m12m21\u03d51(I1)\u03d52(I2)\u2a7e1m12m21\u03d51I\u00af1\u2217\u03d52I\u00af2\u2217.From (3.8a), (3.8b),(3.12)I\u00af2\u2217=\u03d51I\u00af1\u2217I\u00af1\u2217/m21,I\u00af1\u2217=\u03d52I\u00af2\u2217I\u00af2\u2217/m12.Substituting (3.12) into (3.11) givesdg1(I1)dI1dg2(I2)dI2>1.Therefore, since dg1(I1)dI1>1dg2(I2)dI2, starting from the point E\u00af\u2217, the curve determined by I2=g1(I1) is always above the curve determined by I1=g2(I2). So, in the I1-I2 plane, the two curves can only intersect once at E\u00af\u2217 in the interval {I1|0<I1<N1\u2217}. This implies that (3.6a), (3.6b), (3.6c), (3.6d) has a unique endemic equilibrium E\u2217.\n",

It is found that when the basic reproduction number R0<1, system (2.3a), (2.3b), (2.3c), (2.3d) has only one disease free equilibrium point E0, which is globally asymptotically stable. When R0>1, system (2.3a), (2.3b), (2.3c), (2.3d) is uniformly persistent, and in addition, there exists a unique globally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium E\u2217.",

            "text": "Because media coverage is assumed to have no effect in the absence of disease and that the basic reproduction number is evaluated in the absence of disease, media coverage does not play a role in R0. This feature is of course also present in [11], from which our model is derived. Hence, changing the intensity of media coverage cannot be used to trigger the passage of R from values larger to values smaller than 1. Increasing the intensity of media coverage can however greatly reduce the number of infectious individuals at the endemic equilibrium in an endemic situation, i.e., if R>1. On the other hand, if other means are used to bring R to values less than 1, then media coverage can help speed up the extinction of the epidemic.",

            "text": "This work is just a preliminary exploration of the consequences of media coverage on the spatial spread of an infectious disease, and there are many ways in which it could be improved. The first limitation of the system is that it uses a very simple SIS model, whereas a lot of the diseases that would be relevant are expected to follow an SEIRS-type progression. However, this distinction is not as important here as it would be should we have considered problems related to the control of the spread of the infection. In the latter case, the presence of a class of incubating individuals makes controlling the infection hard (since E individuals might travel undetected). In the case of media-induced social distancing, the presence of an E class simply delays the \u2018birth\u2019 of new infectives, so we expect similar results to the ones obtained here. The system should be studied with an arbitrary number of patches. It can be expected, though, that the global results we were able to establish here, in particular about the endemic equilibrium, will be hard to carry through to higher dimensionality. Also, while media coverage can help curtail an epidemic, it can also have negative consequences. The WHO guidance document [23] states, among the Communications actions to be taken in the event of a pandemic, that the WHO should \u2018Continue to work with partners to promote consistent messages\u2019. We have assumed in our model that communication is always beneficial in mitigating the spread of disease. However it is possible that some forms of messaging could be counterproductive from a public health standpoint (e.g. messages inciting fears over vaccine safety). Therefore, more elaborate forms of the \u2018media coverage effect function\u2019 should be considered. This would be a very interesting problem on many different levels: the interaction of patches with different media coverage effect functions, some decreasing, some increasing, would most likely pose difficult and interesting mathematical problems. There are additional temporal effects in social distancing that are important but not taken into consideration here. For example, [7] found that social distancing was generally well accepted, but only insofar as it did not have major economic consequences for the individuals involved. During the 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, [14] found that after initially experiencing high anxiety about getting infected by the virus, individuals were becoming less and less concerned. There is, therefore, a waning of the effect at the individual level that could be taken into account. Finally, knowledge of the presence of a disease could also lead to modification of the rate of travel between locations. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it was for instance observed [15] that air traffic to Mexico was affected in the early stages of the epidemic, although the effect on the overall global air transportation network was less evident. Work is in progress to incorporate such effects to our model.",
