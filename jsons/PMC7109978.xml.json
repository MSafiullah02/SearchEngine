The autopsy tissue samples used in this project were obtained from the Edinburgh Medical Research Council HIV Brain and Tissue Bank at Western General Hospital, Edinburgh. Consent for use of postmortem tissue was obtained from the Lothian Research Ethics Committee. For the studies of viral load in autopsy tissue, lymphoid (lymph node or spleen), brain (frontal or occipital lobe), and bone marrow tissue samples were obtained from 13 HIV-infected individuals with AIDS at time of death, 11 HIV-infected individuals without AIDS, and 8 HIV-uninfected individuals (table 1). Samples were stored at \u201480\u00b0C for use in subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. All but 2 of the study subjects with AIDS were untreated with antiretroviral drugs before death. All pre-AIDS study subjects had a CD4 count of \u2265200 cells/\u00b5L at the time of death, except for 1 study subject with a CD4 count of 167 cells/\u00b5L. All presymptomatic study subjects died from AIDS-unrelated causes [23]. Plasma samples were obtained from a total of 36 previously untreated HIV-1\u2014infected individuals at varying stages of disease progression, which was reflected in their CD4 lymphocyte counts (table 1). Plasma samples were obtained from 40 low-risk HIV-negative individuals who were approximately age matched to the HIV-positive individuals; samples were collected over the same period of time (2003\u20132005).",

As indicated by their frequent detection in autopsy tissue, both B19 and PARV4 showed evidence for the lifelong persistence of infection, which contrasted markedly with the findings for HBoV. The high frequency of detection of B19 in this study is consistent with previous PCR-based evidence for frequent, potentially lifelong persistence of infection [19, 27]\u2014that is, strong anti-B19 cytotoxic T cell reactivity among seropositive individuals [28] and the appearance of the IgG4 subclass of antibody to B19, which usually is associated with chronic viral infection [29]. Indeed, ongoing immunoreactivity to B19 at sites of replication has a potential etiological role in several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis [22, 30\u201335], although high frequencies of B19 detection also have been reported in a variety of tissues (synovium, liver, bone marrow, myocardium, and lymphoid tissue) in study subjects without inflammatory disease [14\u201319]. As indicated by the results of the current study, persistence may be the usual outcome of B19 infection [14], and the detection of B19 may be incidental to inflammatory diseases [15, 36]. Since a high frequency of B19 infection was detected in lymphoid cells in this and a previous study (figure 1A) [19], the higher viral loads in inflamed tissues, such as synovial tissue in subjects with arthritis, may have arisen through the migration of B19-infected inflammatory cells into affected tissues.",

A surprising finding in the current study was the similarity in B19 viral loads between immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals (figure 1A).

The behavior of B19 and PARV4 contrasted markedly with other persistent DNA viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus, for which reactivation leading to clinically significant disease frequently develops during AIDS. As another example, the ubiquitously distributed and persistent small DNA virus torquetenovirus (TTV) also shows evidence of increased viral replication in immunosuppressed individuals [38\u201340]. Using the same autopsy samples that were analyzed in the current study, an \u223c1000-fold increase in TTV viral load was found in the bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, and brain tissue samples from the study subjects with AIDS, compared with the samples from pre-AIDS and HIV-uninfected study subjects (S.

Three hypotheses might explain this restricted distribution. It is possible that, in immunocompetent individuals, the immune system controls PARV4 replication to such an extent that PARV4 DNA becomes undetectable in autopsy samples, whereas reactivation of PARV4 occurs in immunosuppressed individuals through HIV infection. Alternatively, PARV4 infection may be nonpersistent in immunocompetent individuals, but the pre-AIDS study subjects and those with AIDS in the current study may have developed a persistent infection after reexposure to PARV4 while infected with HIV. Finally, it is possible that exposure and infection with PARV4 is restricted to the HIV-infected group because of shared routes of transmission, such as sexual contact or parenteral exposure. The latter possibility is supported by the finding of a history of injection-drug use in each of the PARV4-infected study subjects.",

However, if the replication of PARV4 is controlled by the immune system in way that is similar way B19 replication, then several observations in the current study point toward the third hypothesis. First, evidence from the measurement of PARV4 viral loads in pre-AIDS study subjects or those with AIDS does not indicate that the degree of immunosuppression had any effect on viral replication (figure 1B). If the lack of PARV4 detection in HIV-uninfected individuals was the result of immune control, then viral loads would be expected to be much lower in the pre-AIDS group, since they retain a modestly functioning immune system, compared with the study subjects with AIDS. Second, there was clear differentiation in PARV4 infection status, with concordant results obtained from lymphoid and bone marrow samples from all but 1 individual. There was similarly a distinct distribution of PARV4 viral loads among infected individuals from negative samples (figure 1B). If PARV4 infection was under varying degrees of immune control at different stages of HIV disease progression, such a clear differentiation between HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals would be unlikely. Future investigations of autopsy samples from HIV-infected individuals, non\u2014injection-drug users (IDUs), and HIV-uninfected IDUs will help resolve the underlying reasons for the association of PARV4 infection with HIV infection in the current study.",

Our finding of a significantly older age distribution among study subjects infected with B19 genotype 2 closely reproduced findings from a Finnish study that demonstrated that B19 variants detected in biopsy samples corresponded to the original infecting strains [19]. The observed disappearance of genotype 2 infections in all but 1 individual born after 1965 closely matches data in the current study, in which the last genotype 2 infection was detected in an individual born in 1962 (figure 2A); this similarity provides some evidence for long-range B19 transmission networks between quite distantly separated countries in northern Europe.",

No sequence variation was observed in the 13 genotype 1 sequences of 114 bp. The recently described high rates of sequence change in B19 and canine parvovirus [41, 42] can be used to infer maximum time since divergence for these variants, based on the assumption that substitution rates at synonymous sites in the viral nonstructural regions are similar between different genera of Parvoviridae. By application of the observed mean substitution rate of 1.8 \u00d7 10-4 substitutions per site per year (95th percentile range, 7.5 \u00d7 10-5 to 3.0 \u00d7 10-4 substitutions) [41], the PARV4 variants that infected the study subjects, as well as the individual in whom PARV4 was originally discovered, would have diverged within the last 14 years (range, 8\u201334 years) before death. This prediction indicates a very recent introduction and rapid dissemination of PARV4 infection in the HIV/IDU risk groups in Edinburgh in the 1980s\u20131990s. In contrast, the same calculation applied to B19 genotype 1 variants from the study subjects (mean pairwise distance, 0.47%) predicted an earlier average divergence time of 52 years, which is remarkably consistent with the observed replacement of B19 genotype 2 by genotype 1 in the 1960s (figure 2) [25].",

The combined set of 125 published sequences from the NP1 gene of HBoV sequences, including those from geographically disparate sources such as Sweden [2], Canada [8], Japan [5], and Australia [3], showed a mean pairwise distance of 0.003, which corresponds to a predicted time of origin of 34 years (range, 21\u201383 years). As an intriguing alternative to the hypothesis that HBoV was not detected in autopsy samples because infections were nonpersistent (see above), the genetic data support the possibility that HBoV also might have spread to Scotland very recently and was not circulating during the childhood years of the study subjects (1930s\u20131970s), when HBoV infection usually seems to be acquired. Further studies, including the development of serological assays for antibody to HBoV, are clearly required in order to understand more fully the transmission dynamics and persistence of HBoV, PARV4, and B19 infections.",
