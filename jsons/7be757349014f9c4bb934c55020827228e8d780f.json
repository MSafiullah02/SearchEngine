And for most of them, only a handful of antibodies are arrayed on glass or membrane surfaces. The most exciting application of antibody microarrays for systems biology is proteome profiling and proteome comparison between paired samples, which is very similar to the gene expression microarray [37] (Fig. 3) . Theoretically, if we can have one specific antibody for each human protein, we will be able to profile the human proteome globally in only a few hours. Once fabricated, this type of pan-antibody microarray will have unprecedented advantages over the currently dominant protein profiling technology, i.e. mass spectrometry. To achieve this goal, the biggest challenge we are facing is the high-throughput production of antibodies with high specificity and affinity. Because the traditional method for generating monoclonal antibodies is timeconsuming and laborious, researchers have recently sought alternative approaches. For example, phage antibodydisplay, ribosome display, systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), mRNA display, and affibody display have been developed to expedite the production of antibodies with high specificity [38 -41] . All these methods involve the construction of a large library of viable regions with potential binding activity, which can then be selected by multiple rounds of affinity purification. The binding affinity of the resulting candidate clones can be further improved using maturation strategies. In a most recent study, Reddy et al. [42] bypassed the monoclonal antibody cell screening step by using high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to mine antibody variable region (V)-gene repertoires from bone marrow plasma cells of immunized mice. They found that generated antibodies using this strategy from six mice, each immunized with one of three antigens, were overwhelmingly antigen specific (21/27 or 78%). Another efficient strategy is to generate the so-called monospecific antibody [43] , which is a compromise of polyclonal and monoclonal. The Human Proteome Atlas Project is majorly generating monospecific antibodies against human proteins, and its long-term goal is to have one validated antibody toward all nonredundant human proteins and provide a first draft of the human proteome by 2014. However, the ideal selection system that is not only fast, robust, sensitive, and The key for antibody microarrays is the quality of the antibodies. Antibodies could be either commercially obtained or home-made. They must pass the strict quality control step of both specificity and efficacy prior to microarray fabrication. The protein profiling part is similar to the gene expression microarray. In brief, the paired samples (treated/untreated or patient/health) were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively.

[46] developed the so-called 'reverse-phase' protein array that relies on immobilized lysate, which represents the state of individual Technically, tiny amounts of (a) cellular lysates, from intact cells or laser capture microdissected cells, and (b) body fluids such as serum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, vitreous, saliva, etc. are immobilized as individual spots on a microarray. This microarray is then incubated with a single specific antibody to detect expression of the target protein across many samples. A single microarray can accommodate hundreds to thousands of samples that are printed in a series of replicates. Detection is usually performed using a primary and a secondary labeled antibody. Multiplexing is achieved by probing multiple arrays spotted with the same lysate with different antibodies simultaneously. In addition, since RPAs are utilizing cell lysate, they can provide direct quantifiable information on protein post-translational modifications. Thus, the greatest advantage of RPAs is that they allow for high-throughput, multiplexed, and sensitive detection of proteins from small amounts of input material. RPAs have increased sensitivity and are capable of detecting proteins in the picogram or even the attogram range [47] . The high sensitivity of RPAs allows for the detection of low-abundance proteins or biomarkers such as phosphorylated signaling proteins from very small amounts of starting material such as biopsy samples. Using laser capture microdissection, lysates can be analyzed from as few as 10 cells [48] . Another advantage of RPAs is the uniformity of results, as all samples on the chip are probed with the same set of primary and secondary antibody. This allows for the quantification of differences in protein levels across all samples. The biggest limitation of RPA is that its success is highly dependent on the quality of the antibody set used. All the antibodies for RPA have to be extensively validated, to ensure its reactivity and specificity. RPA has a wide range of possible applications from basic biology, translational and clinical research, such as quantitative analysis of protein expression in cancer cells, body fluids or tissues for biomarker profiling, cell signaling analysis and clinical prognosis, diagnosis, or therapeutic prediction. It has also been used for monitoring protein dynamics in response to various stimuli or doses of drugs at multiple time points. Some other applications of RPA include exploring and mapping protein signaling pathways (Fig. 4) and understanding a candidate drug's molecular mechanism. It has also been suggested as a potential early screening test in cancer patients to facilitate or guide therapeutic decision making. For example, Paweletz et al. [46] used RPA to analyze the pro-survival checkpoint proteins in patient-matched samples at the microscopic transition stage from histologically normal prostate epithelium to prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and then to invasive prostate cancer. Cancer progression was associated with an increased phosphorylation of serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt), suppression of apoptosis pathways, and decreased phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinases. At the transition from histologically normal epithelium to PIN, a significant increase in phosphorylated Akt and a concomitant suppression of downstream apoptosis pathways were observed, preceding the transition into invasive carcinoma. Using the same strategy, two promising diagnostic markers (villin and moesin) for distinguishing colon from ovarian adenocarcinomas [49] were also revealed.

Fifty-two mouse monoclonal antibodies were probed individually to test the expression of 52 proteins on the microarrays.

Femtomolar sensitivity has been achieved for analytical protein microarrays, and the number of applications of functional protein microarrays has grown dramatically. Novel applications utilizing protein microarrays and new protein microarray technologies are continually emerging. However, there are still several issues that need to be resolved before protein chip technology can be widely applied. First, the traditional cloning-expressing-purification-printing approach is still the gold standard for making protein microarrays, especially for proteome microarrays. Because of the sophisticated expertise required and the high cost of production, it is almost impossible for most laboratories to make their own microarrays, but the price for commercial protein chips is unacceptably high. A variety of promising strategies have already been tested to bypass the traditional procedure. However, none of them are close to being used for the large-scale fabrication of protein microarrays. Thus, to make protein microarray technology more applicable, a simpler and more powerful strategy is needed. Second, there is no widely accepted experimental standardization protocol for protein microarrays. Fortunately, this issue is now being investigated by the Human Proteome Organization, which is developing guidelines for experimental design and data annotation. Third, at present most protein microarray results are only semi-quantitative. In order to reach the goal of accurate quantification, which is very critical for most systems biology studies, new technology is eagerly anticipated. Fourth, clinical biobanking (clinical sample collecting, management, and sharing) lags far behind technology development. One of the ultimate goals of systems biology is to understand the biological systems and to facilitate the cure of complex diseases. As a key technology for systems biology, protein microarrays have been largely applied for clinical related research. To ensure the success of this kind of study, a high-quality sample set is a prerequisite. There are already some organizations/consortia specific for biobanking, such as (Biobank UK , Stockport, Greater Manchester, UK) and (Victorian Cancer Biobank, Carlton Victoria, Australia). However, for China, although we have the largest population and the richest clinical sample resource, we still do not have any internationally wellrecognized organization for clinical biobanking. To lead or at least secure a prestigious position in the worldwide competition of systems biology in future, and thus contribute more to clinical research in the long run, there is an urgent need for us to make extensive efforts on clinical biobanking.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Perspectives"}, {"text": "Although still in its developing stage, protein microarrays will no doubt prove to be one of the most powerful Protein microarrays for systems biology tools for systems biology.
