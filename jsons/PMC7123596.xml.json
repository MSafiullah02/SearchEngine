Other sites include nosocomial central line-associated bacteremia, urinary tract, and surgical site infections. The greatest risk is within the first year after transplantation, particularly in the first 3\u20136 months. Donor infection and recipient airway colonization are also risk factors (Speich and van der Bij 2001; Aguilar-Guisado et al. 2007; Parada et al. 2010; Burguete et al. 2013; Yun et al. 2015). One of the largest studies of primarily adults found that 75% of infections occurred within the first year posttransplant and 42% occurred within the first 3 months. The majority, 48%, was bacterial (Parada et al. 2010; Burguete et al. 2013). Another study showed similar results but found that bacteremia, both primary and catheter associated, was the most common infection in the first month after transplant with pneumonia becoming most frequent after 2 months. Multidrug-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and carbapenem-resistant or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli were involved in 66% of infections. Bacterial infections were significantly more common in those colonized with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli than those who were not (Yun et al. 2015).",

The role of infection in the development of CLAD has recently been reviewed (Martin-Gandul et al. 2015; Gregson 2016). While acute infection with community-acquired respiratory viruses is recognized as a risk, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are increasingly recognized as well. One study of lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis found that loss of colonization with Pseudomonas was protective against the development of BOS (Gottlieb et al. 2009). Two further studies found that infections due to gram-positive bacteria, primarily Staphylococcus aureus, increased the hazard risk for BOS (Gupta et al. 2009; Valentine et al. 2009). The underlying allograft inflammatory state in the setting of infection also appears to be important in determining the development of CLAD (Gregson 2016). \n",

The site of infection was pneumonia 48%, tracheobronchitis 26%, and bacteremia 12%. Colonization before transplant with MRSA was a risk factor for MRSA infection posttransplant but was not associated with increased mortality at 30 and 90 days post onset of infection (Shields et al. 2012). A second study had a calculated incidence rate of MRSA of 76 cases per 1000 transplant years with the median onset of 3 months posttransplant. The most common site was the lower respiratory tract and 31% of MRSA infections were associated with bacteremia. The direct mortality after MRSA infection was 17.6% (Manuel et al. 2009).",

Isolation after transplant is also common from 13 to 22% with MAC accounting for about 70%. Invasive disease after transplant is much less common, however, occurring in fewer than 5% of lung transplant recipients (Chalermskulrat et al. 2006; Chernenko et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2011; Knoll et al. 2012). Pretransplant colonization has been associated with an increased risk of posttransplant NTM infection as well as invasive disease but only for M. abscessus (Chalermskulrat et al. 2006). While NTM isolation and disease particularly with M. abscessus is associated with increased complications post lung transplant, it has not been associated with increased mortality and is not considered an absolute contraindication to transplantation (Chalermskulrat et al. 2006; Knoll et al. 2012; Qvist et al. 2013). Case reports of two adolescents with cystic fibrosis and pretransplant M. abscessus infection showed that when antibiotic therapy led to AFB stain negativity at the time of transplant, the outcome was favorable even in the face of positive cultures (Zaidi et al. 2009).",

However, posttransplant colonization was not associated with invasive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary fungal infections were not associated with chronic allograft rejection or death (Liu et al. 2009b). A larger retrospective multicenter study with patients transplanted in 1988\u20132006 found tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, cytomegalovirus sero-mismatch, age over 15 years, and prior episode of rejection greater than A2 were risks for pulmonary fungal infection, but the study did not investigate colonization as a risk factor (Danziger-Isakov et al. 2008). Additionally, pulmonary fungal infection was independently associated with decreased 12-month survival. Mortality for proven and probable infection was 38 and 11%, respectively, similar to what has been reported for adults (Danziger-Isakov et al. 2008). Bronchial airway anastomotic complications occurred in 14% of 214 pediatric lung transplant recipients in a single center cohort, and this complication was associated with prior episodes of posttransplant fungal infection (Choong et al. 2006).

As with Candida species, speciation of Aspergillus is important. While A. fumigatus causes the majority of disease, other species including A. niger, A. terreus, A. flavus, and A. ustus appear to be increasing in prevalence especially with the use of inhaled amphotericin as prophylaxis (Hosseini-Moghaddam and Husain 2010; Peghin et al. 2016).",

Several small, nonrandomized clinical trials in adult recipients have demonstrated efficacy ranging from 80 to 100% (Hosseini-Moghaddam and Husain 2010; Brizendine et al. 2011). Three main approaches have been used in lung transplant recipients: universal prophylaxis, targeted prophylaxis, and pre-emptive therapy. Universal prophylaxis is given to all recipients immediately post transplantation while targeted prophylaxis is given to patients with known risk factors (Neoh et al. 2011). Further, response to positive cultures on routine posttransplant bronchoscopy may prompt initiation of pre-emptive therapy, but the optimal response to positive BAL cultures is unclear (Avery 2011). While inhaled amphotericin has recently been linked to a decrease in post-transplant Aspergillus, amphotericin-resistant strains have emerged indicating that intervention is not benign (Peghin et al. 2016).",

Controversies include choices around the use of universal prophylaxis, risk-based prophylaxis, or pre-emptive therapy and duration of prevention strategy (Danziger-Isakov et al. 2003a). As the merits and potential disadvantages in the limited population of pediatric transplant recipients are difficult to discern, extrapolation from the adult lung transplant population directs current practice (Kotton et al. 2013). Data from adult lung transplantation indicates that prolonged prophylaxis (9\u201312 months) with valganciclovir has both short- and long-term benefits preventing CMV events and decreasing risk for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (Finlen et al. 2011; Mitsani et al. 2010; Palmer et al. 2010). Pre-emptive therapy is NOT currently recommended for high-risk CMV D+/R\u2212 lung transplant recipients (Kotton et al. 2013; Razonable et al. 2013). Antiviral complications including nephrotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal manifestations, and the development of viral resistance mutations must be considered when developing prevention strategies (Mitsani et al. 2010; Danziger-Isakov and Mark Baillie 2009). A study in pediatric transplantation showed safety and efficacy of an oral valganciclovir dosing algorithm, but no pediatric lung transplant recipients were enrolled (Vaudry et al. 2009).",

Viral culture or a pp65 antigenemia assay has been replaced by more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Weinberg et al. 2000). As interassay and intercenter variability has been reported for PCR testing even in controlled research settings; utilization of a consistent assay is crucial so that results can be compared for an individual subject over time (Pang et al. 2009; Rychert et al. 2014). Based on multicenter retrospective evaluation of pediatric lung transplant recipients (Danziger-Isakov et al. 2009), the highest risk period for CMV infection occurs during the first 6 weeks after discontinuation of prophylaxis; thus, appropriate monitoring should occur during this high-risk period. Additionally, evaluation for CMV should occur with new onset symptoms suspicious for CMV infection including fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy even in CMV D\u2212/R\u2212 patients. Increased frequency of CMV surveillance is suggested during periods of increased immunosuppression, but not limited to cytolytic therapy for refractory rejection, plasmapheresis, or prolonged lymphopenia (Kotton et al. 2013). Additional monitoring for CMV-specific immunity continues to develop (Westall et al. 2008; Kumar et al. 2009; Snyder et al. 2011; Manuel et al. 2013b) and may be employed in the future to personalize CMV prevention strategies.",

A multicenter randomized clinical trial of predominantly adult kidney transplant recipients reported noninferiority of oral valganciclovir compared to intravenous ganciclovir for nonlife-threatening CMV disease; however, no pediatric patients were enrolled (Asberg et al. 2007). Current recommendations from the Transplant Society Consensus Statement include the use of intravenous ganciclovir for pediatric-aged patients as first-line therapy with acknowledgement that some experts would use oral valganciclovir for CMV infection (Kotton et al. 2013). Oral ganciclovir, acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir should not be used to treat CMV. Adjunctive therapy with immunoglobulins for severe pneumonitis (either intravenous immunoglobulin or CMVIG) can be considered (Kotton et al. 2013). Resistant CMV is rarely reported in pediatric transplant recipients (Martin et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2012), but concern may prompt consideration for alternative antiviral therapy including high-dose ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir (Kotton et al. 2013). Newer antiviral agents are under investigation as options for either prevention or treatment including brincidofovir, letermovir, and maribavir. Emerging data on the adoptive transfer of CMV-specific T-cells and the use of small-molecule drugs such as sirolimus, leflunomide, and artesunate may alter the future of treatment, but currently no data related to these interventions exist for pediatric lung transplant recipients.",

Most adenovirus serotypes (with the exception of adenovirus 40 and 41 which cause gastroenteritis) can be isolated in cell culture; however, diagnosis by PCR is more commonly used and available. The sensitivity of rapid antigen detection tests is variable and not reliable in immunocompromised hosts. While adenovirus can be identified in respiratory secretions, stool, and urine, these are places where prolonged shedding after infection may occur. Therefore, the diagnosis of acute infection is more reliable when viral identification is associated with consistent clinical symptoms, or when adenovirus is found in otherwise sterile specimens such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid or in tissues. Rising viremia and detection of virus in two or more sites is considered consistent with invasive adenovirus disease. A viral load cutoff or threshold does not exist to predict the progression of disease or its outcome. However, higher and/or persistent viral loads are concerning for progressive or disseminated disease and typically indicate the need to intervene.",

In certain cases, antiviral treatment may be useful, if instituted with the guidance and follow-up of a pediatric infectious diseases specialist. While there are no approved adenovirus-specific antivirals, some agents such as cidofovir have activity against adenovirus and have been used empirically for treatment. However, use of this agent is limited by its propensity to cause nephrotoxicity and bone marrow suppression. Close follow up and monitoring for these side effects is recommended. The standard dose of cidofovir in children is 5 mg/Kg once weekly. However, more frequent, lower dosage (1 mg/Kg three times per week) and pre- and post-dose hydration have been used in an attempt to reduce the risk of renal toxicity (Doan et al. 2007). Treatment is usually continued until resolution of viremia and/or symptoms, with close monitoring for side effects. Other antivirals have been evaluated for treatment of adenovirus, including a lipid conjugate of cidofovir (CMX001, Chimerix Inc.), which is administered orally and has a lower risk for nephrotoxicity; however, its use remains experimental at this time. Lung transplant patients with severe infection may have hypogammaglobulinemia, and in these cases, administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for replacement has been used, although its benefit has not been proven (Mawhorter and Yamani 2008). An effective novel treatment strategy has been developed with the use of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) directed against adenovirus in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients; CTLs have not been evaluated in lung or other pediatric solid organ transplant recipients (Leen et al. 2009).",

Lung transplant recipients are at risk for community and nosocomial exposures during the typical time of circulation of these viruses. Infection with respiratory viruses may also increase the risk for secondary bacterial pneumonia and other bacterial or fungal infections, particularly in the first few months after transplant (Liu et al. 2009a). After an acute lower respiratory virus infection, the risk for graft rejection or chronic allograft dysfunction may increase as shown in adult lung transplant recipients; however, this is controversial and has not been shown in pediatric lung transplant recipients to date (Liu et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2009a; Vu et al. 2011).",

Immediate initiation of neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamivir and zanamivir) therapy in lung transplant patients with fever and/or other respiratory symptoms during the period of influenza circulation may decrease the risk of complications and death associated with influenza. Although influenza antivirals are usually preferred within 48 h of the onset of clinical symptoms, lung and other solid organ transplant patients have improved outcomes even with later treatment initiation (Kumar et al. 2010). In some cases, a more prolonged duration of antiviral therapy has been used given these patient\u2019s immune-suppressed status and prolonged viral shedding. Intravenous peramivir (also a neuraminidase inhibitor) is now licensed for adults, with clinical studies underway in children and adolescents.

Therefore, vaccination of close contacts and avoidance of contact with sick individuals become important measures for prevention of infection (Avery et al. 2013). Prophylactic antivirals may also help decrease the risk of infection and complications in exposed unvaccinated or unprotected transplant recipients. There are no other vaccines available for the prevention of respiratory infection in most pediatric lung transplant recipients.
