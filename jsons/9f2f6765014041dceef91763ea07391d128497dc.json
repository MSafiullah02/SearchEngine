As outlined in the recent paper by Druss (2020) , a medical field likely to experience significant consequences of the pandemic and its accompanying societal changes is that of psychiatry. Indeed, there are studies suggesting that there may be a general worsening of mental health in the populations affected by the pandemic. In a recent survey from China, 54% of the respondents rated the COVID-19 outbreak to have a moderate or severe negative psychological impact (Wang et al., 2020) . A similar tendency was seen in a survey conducted in the USA by the American Psychiatric Association (2020). Howeverin both casesthere were no prior survey data targeting the same population available to allow for a benchmark comparison. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to measure the level of psychological well-being in Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it to prior Danish data obtained with the same measure.",

The WHO-5 score ranges from 0 (minimum well-being) to 100 (maximum well-being). The survey also contained six questions regarding the experienced level of anxiety/depression over the past 2 weeks reported on a scale from 0 (not present) to 10 (present to an extreme degree). The survey was fielded from March 31 to April 6, 2020 and was completed by 2458 respondents. After weighting (applied in all analyses), the sample is representative of the population on key demographic and political variables (gender, age, education, region and party choice in the last election).",

Finally, the relationship between the reported symptom levels of anxiety/depression and the WHO-5 scores from the CCDPS 2020 was characterised by Spearman's correlation coefficients. Based on the known gender differences in the prevalence of anxiety/depression, we also conducted analyses stratified by gender.",

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of WHO-5 scores by gender for the two surveys. The proportion of respondents from the CCDPS 2020 with WHO-5 scores <50 was significantly higher than for the DMHWBS 2016 survey for the total sample (25.4% vs. 22.5%, p < 0.001) and for females (28.8% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.005), but not for males (21.8% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.110).
