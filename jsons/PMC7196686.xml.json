As previously reported, visual assessment is probably the less accurate measure of surface cleanliness(4,5) whereas microbiological assessments could be considered a reference method, being able to predict, at least theoretically, the risk of infection for patients. In the last decades several authors have proposed detection of ATP bioluminescence for quickly monitoring and having a standardized sensitive measure of hospital cleanliness. However, among the few studies that compared this method with microbiological cultures, a large majority found no correlation between RLU values and ACC.(13\u201315) Otherwise, a minority of authors reported a good agreement or a weak relationship between the two methods.(16,17) Our results confirm the latter findings, suggesting that surfaces with low microbial contamination also had low bioluminescence and that RLU values could explain about one-third of the ACC variability. According to this observation, Griffith et al. found that about 33% of the ATP from hand contact surfaces is likely to be of microbial origin with the remainder non-microbial.(4)",

The present study shows that a certain number of surfaces with ATP values \u2264500 RLU could have a microbial contamination higher than 2.5 cfu/cm2 or presence of S. aureus and, consequently, the use of such a benchmark could be questionable. Otherwise, our experiences suggest that, using Lumicontrol II, an ATP value of 100 RLU could be a better bioluminescence benchmark, having a low risk (<5%) of classifying as \u201cclean\u201d a significantly contaminated surface.",

First, the culture plates used are a selective filter and only indicate presence of organisms that may be culturable on such a media whereas no information is provided about those that are not culturable (e.g., anaerobic organisms and viable but non-culturable organisms). Second, our study has not considered standardized experimental contamination but, instead, included surfaces cleaned by various personnel and highly contaminated by patients, personnel, and visitors. This last point can also be considered a strength since it describes the real surface situation in a hospital environment.",
