Recently, it has become clear that a wide variety of lipids and glycolipids are also targets of the T cell response. This novel form of cell-mediated immune recognition is mediated by a family of lipid binding and presenting molecules known as CD1. The CD1 proteins represent a small to moderate sized family of b2-microglobulin-associated transmembrane proteins that are distantly related to MHC class I and class II molecules. They are conserved in most or all mammals, and control the development and function of T cell populations that participate in innate and adaptive immune responses through the recognition of self and foreign lipid antigens. Here we review the current state of our understanding of the structure and function of CD1 proteins, and the role of CD1-restricted T cell responses in the immune system.",

The innate immune response relies on the recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns by a limited number of germline-encoded receptors with fixed structures, while the adaptive immune response allows the recognition of a potentially unlimited repertoire of antigens by specific receptors (i.e., immunoglobulins and T cell receptors) obtained by random recombination of genomic segments. One of the key mechanisms of this adaptive response is the T cell receptor-mediated recognition of the complexes formed by the association of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I or class II molecules with peptides.",

Among these, it has been proposed that two or perhaps three distinct groups of CD1 proteins can be discerned, based on sequence homologies, sites of expression and function. Thus, CD1a, CD1b and CD1c are typically classified as group 1 CD1 proteins, while the more divergent CD1d protein comprises group 2 (3). The CD1e protein has not been extensively studied, but it is intermediate in terms of its homology to group 1 and group 2 CD1 proteins, and appears to be unique in that its expression may be confined exclusively to intracellular compartments of myeloid lineage cells (4). Thus, we currently support the classification of CD1e as group 3 CD1. Most species studied to date show the presence of genes for multiple homologs of the human group 1 CD1 proteins, the exception being mice and rats, which only have genes encoding CD1d-like proteins. The group 2 CD1 proteins appear to be even more highly conserved, and have been found in all mammals for which CD1 genes or proteins have been characterized in detail, with the exception of the guinea pig (Table 1) .",

Analysis of CD1a trafficking in freshly extracted human LC suggests that CD1a molecules present at the cell surface spontaneously internalize via clathrin-coated vesicles. Most likely, they are rapidly distributed to the early/sorting endosomes and delivered to early/recycling endosomes, and from this site they recycle back to the plasma membrane (10).

This internalization is dependent on a tyrosine-based motif of the cytoplasmic tail (YXXF, where Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and F is a bulky hydrophobic residue), prob-ably through its interaction with cytosolic adaptor protein complex 13) . Subsequent sorting to the late endosomal compartment may be dependent on interaction of the CD1b tail with another adaptor protein 14) . It should be noted that these features of trafficking and localization have been described for human CD1b, but may not apply in all cases to orthologues of this protein in other species.

Top: mycolates. These are a-branched, b-hydroxy fatty acids produced by bacteria belonging to the order Actinomycetales (e.g., mycobacteria, nocardia, corynebacteria and rhodococci). CD1b is known to present both free and glycosylated forms of these, including a wide variety of different mycolate structures distinguished by variations in their chain lengths, the presence or absence of double bonds or cyclopropyl groups, and the presence or absence of oxygen containing substitutions (R group) near the distal end of the longer meromycolate branch. Illustrated are a dicyclopropanated C80 mycolate lacking an R group (a-mycolic acid), and a typical methoxy-mycolate of M. tuberculosis. Two of the many potential forms of glucose monomycolate are illustrated, both of which are known to be presented by human CD1b. Center: glycosphingolipids. The prototype for this class is the marine spongederived glycolipid (2S,3S,4R)-1-O-(a-D-galactopyranosyl)-N-hexacosanoyl-2-amino-1,3,4-octadecanetriol, generally referred to as a-galactosyl ceramide. More recent studies have demonstrated CD1-restricted presentation of several mammalian glycosphingolipids, two of which are illustrated. Bottom: glycophospholipids. Mycobacterial forms of this class were initially demonstrated to be presented by human CD1b, including the relatively simple phosphatidylinositol dimannoside structure shown and more heavily glycosylated versions of this basic structure such as lipoarabinomannans of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae. Mammalian phosphatidylinositol and more highly glycosylated versions of this structure (glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPI)) have been shown to bind to mouse and human CD1d proteins, although evidence for their recognition by T cells is currently limited, The fully saturated b1-mannosyl phosphoisoprenoids isolated from M. tuberculosis and M. avium are unique at present as the only CD1-presented antigens bearing a single alkyl chain tail.

This may be particularly true for highly successful pathogens like M.",

The same may be true for certain tumors, in which modified or aberrantly expressed glycolipids could represent a major basis for immune recognition. These aspects of the CD1-restricted response are thus likely to have relevance to immunotherapies of infectious and neoplastic disease through novel approaches to vaccine development.",

            "text": "In addition to their role in the adaptive immune response, CD1restricted T cell responses also appear to be intimately connected to the generation of innate immunity. This is particularly evident from the many studies of CD1d-restricted NK T cells, a highly conserved innate-like lymphocyte in most or possibly all mammals that has the ability to trigger a powerful adjuvant cascade. While this can heighten inflammation and microbial resistance under some circumstances, the tremendous immunoregulatory potential of these T cells in other cases demonstrates their potential utility for controlling autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Understanding how to manipulate these T cells precisely through their recognition of CD1-presented lipid ligands is likely to provide the key to exploiting their considerable potential as agents for promoting beneficial immunity and treating disease.",

Disruption of endosomal trafficking of CD1b by mutation of the targeting motif in its cytoplasmic tail increased the surface expression of CD1b as expected, and increased the presentation of C32 GMM while inhibiting the presentation of C80 GMM. Interestingly, presentation of GMM by nonprofessional APC gave opposite results with a preferential presentation of C32 GMM.

Taken together, these results suggest that the loading of glycolipid antigens onto CD1c occurs efficiently in nonacidified or weakly acidified early endocytic compartments, and probably also to some extent at the cell surface.346 Tissue Antigens 2002: 60: 337-353 CD1d Studies using aGalCer as a model glycolipid antigen have created some controversy regarding the necessity of lipid antigen internalization for presentation by CD1d. The stimulation of NKT cells by aGalCer was initially reported to be inhibited by cell fixation before pulsing and by agents that block endosomal acidification (25, 26). However, Kronenberg and colleagues reported that immobilized recombinant murine and human CD1d molecules could be loaded at neutral pH with aGalCer for presentation to NKT cells (47).

Both of these mechanisms were originally suggested by studies of human CD1b(48). In addition, a recent study of the presentation of a disaccharide-containing synthetic analog of aGalCer (Gal(al\u00bb2)GalCer) revealed a clear requirement for removal of the terminal sugar by a lysosomal enzyme prior to effective presentation to CD1d-restricted T cells (49).This provided a clear precedent for the requirement of enzymatic cleavage of the carbohydrate portion of a glycolipid antigen in a lysosomal compartment prior to its presentation to CD1-restricted T cells. Based on these findings, it seems that enzymatic trimming of the carbohydrate portions of natural CD1-presented antigens is likely to occur, although direct evidence for this is still lacking. It is currently not known whether enzymatic modification or cleavage of the alkyl tails of lipid antigens is possible in antigen presenting cells, or whether this may be required for presentation by CD1 in some cases.Another mechanism by which some CD1 proteins may accommodate the binding of very long lipids may involve the complex folding of alkyl chains within the groove. This possibility has been illustrated by recent functional studies on the presentation of very long chain mycolic acids by humanCD1b (39).

To date, this hypothesis has been examined in mycobacterial infections only, although limited data also suggest the capacity of CD1 molecules to present antigens derived from Gram negative bacteria. Perhaps the strongest evidence for an effective role of antigen-specific CD1-restricted T cells in host defense against mycobacteria is the discovery that CD1c-restricted T cells specific for mycobacterial isoprenoid glycolipids are common in individuals previously infected with M. tuberculosis, but are not seen in naive control subjects (22).Also relevant is the observation that mycobacterial production of the CD1b-presented antigen GMM absolutely requires a nonmycobacterial source of glucose (51). Therefore, a CD1b-mediated T cell response to GMM would appear with pathogenic mycobacteria that have invaded host tissues and not with saprophytic mycobacteria that are unable to grow in animal tissues.This implies that GMM could function essentially as a pathogenassociated molecular pattern that signals the invasion of host 347 Tissue Antigens 2002: 60: 337-353 tissues by actively growing mycobacteria, leading to an immune response that can be triggered through presentation by CD1b.The role of CD1-restricted T cell responses has also been studied in leprosy. CD4 \u03c0 CD1b-restricted and CD1c-restricted T cell lines were derived from skin lesions of human subjects with M. leprae infection. These T cell lines produced IFNg and GM-CSF in response to activation with M. leprae antigens, suggesting their potential contribution in the immune response toM. leprae (50). Furthermore, analysis of skin biopsy specimens demonstrated that lesions of tuberculoid leprosy, in which a strong cell-mediated immune response controls the growth of M. leprae, contain approximately 10 times more CD1 \u03c0 dendritic cells than were observed in lepromatous leprosy lesions, where an inefficient Th1 immune response results in poorly organized cellular infiltrates and bacterial proliferation(52).",

A protective role of CD1d-restricted T cells has also been recently identified in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia (63). Other models however, suggest that CD1drestricted T cells might play a regulatory role in immune response against bacterial pathogens by the secretion of Th2 cytokines(64).Although, analysis of CD1d -/mice does not support a critical role for CD1d-restricted T cells in mycobacterial infection(65), granulomatous reaction in response to subcutaneous injection of mycobacterial extracts is impaired in NK T cell deficient mice. It was recently demonstrated that NK T cell accumulation at the site of injection in this experimental model is not dependent on TCR activation, and can be induced by a variety of glycolipids(66). The exact mechanisms of this phenomenon and their pertinence in bacterial infection remain to be determined.VirusesThe role of NK T cells in immune responses against viruses has been particularly studied in the liver, where, at least in mice, NK T cells are the major resident T cell population.

The initial activation also leads to an up-regulation of CD40L on the NK T cells.(2) The interaction of CD40L with CD40 activates the antigen-presenting cell (APC) which produces IL-12. (3) The release of IL-12 amplifies the production of IFNg by the NK T cells and acts together with IFNg to activate NK cells.(4) IL-12 also plays a major role in the polarization of Th0 naive T cells into Th1 helper and cytotoxic T cells. (5) IL-4 production by NK T cells contributes to the activation of B cells. The immunoglobulin production by B cells is influenced by the balance between IL-4 and IFNg. While IFNg promotes IgG2a production, IL-4 stimulates IgG1 and lgE secretion. (6) In addition, IL-4 can polarize Th0 T cells toward the Th2 phenotype. Under conditions that favor the preferential production of IL-4 following initial activation of NK T cells, this effect on Th2 polarization may predominate.349 Tissue Antigens 2002: 60: 337-353 tions.

Recently, it has also been reported that administration of aGalCer to mice with a suboptimal dose of irradiated P. yoelii sporozoites or suboptimal doses of recombinant viruses expressing malarial antigens enhances protective antimalarial immunity, thus indicating an adjuvant-like property of this NK T cell activator (70).",

Terabe et al. observed, in a model where the tumor spontaneously regresses after initial growth and then recurs, that tumor recurrence was due to the incomplete elimination of tumor cells by CD8 \u03c0 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and that this is linked to a suppressive effect of NK T cells on CTL induction, mediated by the production of IL-13 (73).

While the currently published studies have examined Ii association only for CD1d, preliminary studies indicate that this can also be demonstrated for human CD1b (M. Sugita, V. Briken and S. A.

Binding of endogenous and exogenous lipids by CD1 molecules. CD1 molecules probably bind endogenous self lipids (green ovals) such as phosphatidylinositiol and glycosylphosphatidylinositol in the ER. The association may stabilize the molecule and protect the binding groove during migration to the cell surface. After internalization from the cell surface, the various CD1 isoforms follow similar pathways into the endocytic system. They accumulate at different sites (EE vs LE vs MIIC/Lys), which allows them to collectively sample the entire endocytic network. As they pass through the various compartments CD1 molecules may exchange the endogenous lipids loaded in the ER with other lipids accumulating in the cell via fluid phase or receptormediated endocytosis (lavender and brown ovals) or phagocytosis (pink ovals). Most CD1 molecules recycle several times between the plasma membrane and the endosomes, thus enhancing their chances of encountering antigenic lipids at intracellular sites. diagonally to the horizontal axes of the al and a2 helices of CD1.This orientation is predicted to place the highly variable CDR3 loops of the TCR over the opening of the binding groove where they could make direct interactions with the hydrophilic cap of the lipid antigen bound in the CD1 groove.CDR3b sequences suggests that the selection for Vb8, Vb7 and Vb2 probably involves the CDR1 and CDR2 regions of these Vb segments, most likely because of their ability to interact effectively with the a-helical surface of CD1d rather than with the bound antigen.In addition, T cells that show autoreactivity to CD1d but do not respond to aGalCer have been identified. These T cells have been called diverse CD1d-restricted T cells because they do not express the invariant TCRa chain, and instead express a variety of Va and Vb gene segments. Although the diversity of the TCR of these T cells is not completely known yet, analysis of their repertoire has indicated preferential use of genes from the Vb8 family, like NK T cells expressing the invariant TCRa chain(42, 43). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that their Va repertoire is likely to be biased by the recurrent usage of a few Va chains, such as Va3.2 However, it is important to note that nearly all of the TCR repertoire analyses summarized above have focused on populations of CD1restricted T cells that show autoreactivity to the CD1d molecule. It remains possible that other populations of nonautoreactive CD1drestricted T cells may exist that use a more extensive repertoire of TCR to recognize a more diverse array of potential antigens.
