            "text": "Swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS\u2010CoV) is a newly discovered coronavirus which is an enveloped, positive and single\u2010stranded sense RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 27 kb (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). SADS\u2010CoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae which contains four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Woo, Huang, Lau, & Yuen, 2010; Woo et al., 2012). So far, six coronaviruses have been identified from pigs, which include porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), SADS\u2010CoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) that all belong to the Alphacoronavirus genus, as well as one betacoronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) and one deltacoronavirus, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (Lin, Saif, Marthaler, & Wang, 2016; Wesley, Woods, & Cheung, 1991; Woo et al., 2010). Among these viruses, SADS\u2010CoV is the most newly discovered coronavirus, which has been first reported in 2017 in China and is considered to be an HKU2\u2010related coronavirus with a bat\u2010origin (Gong et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). In January 2017, SADS\u2010CoV was detected in a swine farm and subsequently spread rapidly to three other farms in Guangdong Province and caused the fatal swine acute diarrhoea syndrome (SADS) characterized by the clinical signs with severe, acute diarrhoea and rapid weight loss of piglets. The symptoms of SADS\u2010CoV are similar to those that caused by other swine enteric coronaviruses such as PDCoV and PEDV, but SADS\u2010CoV is more harmful than these viruses because it has led to the death of almost 25,000 piglets in a short time and resulted in more significant economic losses (Dong et al., 2015; Sun, Wang, Wei, Chen, & Feng, 2016; Zhou et al., 2018). So, it is urgent to investigate the molecular epidemiology and transmission patterns of SADS\u2010CoV for establishing effective controls for this new coronavirus.",

And this time point is 5 months earlier than the first discovered time reported by our previous study (Zhou et al., 2018). As the same time, clinical signs of SADS\u2010CoV during the retrospective investigation included sever and acute vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to death in piglets that were less than 5 days of age with a mortality rate of around 50%. These clinical presentations were similar to those signs in the large scale outbreak of SADS\u2010CoV reported by Zhou et al. (2018), except the mortality rate in piglets later increased to 90%.",

Except PEDV, SADS\u2010CoV had the second high infection rate (43.53%), which exhibits an evidently prevailing tendency in pigs. Meanwhile, of the SADS\u2010CoV positive samples, 62.2% were co\u2010infections with one to four other viruses, revealing a high prevalence of co\u2010infection in the sampled farms. Notably, our results also showed that SADS\u2010CoV and PEDV were simultaneously present in all co\u2010infection samples of SADA\u2010CoV. Considering the fact that PEDV has caused prior outbreaks of the porcine diarrhoea at the pig farm where Zhou et al. (2018) later reported the occurrence of SADS\u2010CoV, PEDV seems to be able to contribute to the infection of SADS\u2010CoV in pigs. Thus, SADS\u2010CoV may be pathogenic as secondary infection following the infection of PEDV, which needs further studies to better understand the pathogenesis of this novel coronavirus.",

Our results also indicated that both the complete genomes, N genes and S genes of all SADS\u2010CoV strains shared the highest nucleotides identifies with those corresponding sequences of four bat coronavirus HKU2 strains. In this work, The phylogenetic trees of full length genomes and S genes of SADS\u2010CoV sequences showed that the SADS\u2010CoV branch clustered with these four HKU2 strains, which is same to previous results (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018). Besides the genomes and S genes, the tree of N genes in our study revealed the identical result too. So far, a total of eight full\u2010length genomes of SADS\u2010CoV have been reported in Guangdong Province of China (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018; this study). The two new genomes of SADS\u2010CoV sequences in this work shared 100% nucleotides identities with the sequence MF167434 published by Gong et al. (2017) and our four previously reported sequences (Zhou et al., 2018), and shared 99.8% nucleotides identities with the sequence MF370205 studied by Pan et al. (2017). The results suggest that these eight SADS\u2010CoV sequences may come from the same origin. Only the phylogenetic tree of S genes in our work showed that sequences of the AlphaCoV were divided into two sublineages, AlphaCoV1 which contained all SADS\u2010CoV sequences and AlphaCoV2, clustering together with sequences of the BeltaCoV and the DelatCov, respectively. And this result was consistent with the study of Pan et al. (2017). As a newly discovered coronavirus, the availability of SADS\u2010CoV sequences data is limited which prevents better understandings of the molecular epidemiology of this virus. Meanwhile, being a RNA virus, SADS\u2010CoV may mutate rapidly and exhibit high genetic differences (Drummond, Pybus, Rambaut, Forsberg, & Rodrigo, 2003; K\u00fchnert, Wu, & Drummond, 2011). So, new more available sequences data are warranted to give a deep insight of viral genetic origin, evolution, and transmission patterns of SADS\u2010CoV.",

The severe clinical symptoms and the strong transmission in short term highlights the urgency to develop effective measures to control this new discovered virus. Further studies, such as the epidemiology, virology and pathobiology should be performed for better understanding of SADS\u2010CoV in China.",
