In New York City, the epicenter of the US outbreak, almost all hospital resources were directed towards supporting surge beds for COVID patients. However, vascular surgery emergencies still needed to be addressed. We describe a case of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) presenting to a Brooklyn, NY hospital in the middle of the pandemic. Fundamental vascular surgery treatment principles were maintained, with a few special considerations. The patient gave his consent to have his case published.",

These were given to every staff member that was required to enter the OR.

After PPE was donned, we \u201cscrubbed\u201d the gloves with Avagard (chlorhexidine gluconate 1% / ethyl alcohol 61%), then put on sterile gown and gloves over everything. All non-essential personnel were prohibited from entering the OR. We utilized two circulating nurses, one inside the OR and one outside the OR to prevent repeated entering and exiting. Recovery occurred in the OR, as the regular post-anesthesia care unit had already been converted to a COVID intensive care unit. Post recovery, patients were transferred to dedicated COVID floors.",

The potential increased risk of limb thrombosis was taken into account as these patients are thought to be in a prothrombotic state. [[1], [2], [3]] Considering the risks and benefits, and the available resources, we felt endovascular repair would still be preferable at this time. After the procedure, we immediately resumed aspirin and clopidogrel which the patient was already on. Fortunately our patient did not have any thrombotic events. At the time of his presentation, we did not think full dose anticoagulation was necessary. However, as more and more arterial thrombotic complications are being reported, we feel a short course of anticoagulation after aortic stent graft implantation with either a low molecular weight heparin or novel oral anticoagulant would be justified until the COVID-19 infection is cleared.",

Local anesthesia for EVAR of a ruptured AAA correlates to shorter ICU stays, lower pulmonary complications, and lower mortality compared to general anesthesia in a Vascular Quality Initiative database analysis. [7] Equally important, intubation has been shown to be a major aerosol producing procedure, in turn a potential threat all personnel in the operating room. [8] Lastly, this would avoid the chance of not being able to extubate after the procedure, thus tying up another ventilator in the hospital. The main reason in favor of general anesthesia would be to avoid an emergent intubation in the middle of the procedure. We had an extensive discussion with our anesthesiologist prior to bring the patient into the OR, and for the reasons above, chose to use local anesthesia for the case thus avoiding intubation and minimizing exposure to the staff.",
