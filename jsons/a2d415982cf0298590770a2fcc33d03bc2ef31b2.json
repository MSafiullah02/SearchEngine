By physical examinations, his body temperature was 37.6 \u00b0C, with clear sound by lung percussion, clear breathing sounds by auscultation with no obvious dry and moist rales. Laboratory tests revealed WBC count 6.19 \u00d7 10 9 /L, GR% 77.11 %, MONO% 12.4 %, lymphocytes ratio 10.32 %, hs-CRP 85 mg/L, and ESR 9 mm/h. Serological test for M. pneumoniae was negative and blood biochemistry showed no abnormity. Chest CT indicated large high-density opacity with uneven density and poorly defi ned boundary in the lingual segment of left upper lung lobe. And the diagnosis was considered to be pneumonia of the left lung. After treatment for 2 days, the patient still experienced fever and was transferred into a large hospital for treatment. After that, the patient showed persistent fever with a body temperature of 37.6 \u00b0C. Bedside chest X-ray after 10 days demonstrated increased and blurry lung markings and multiple cotton like and fl akes of opacity in both lungs. Bedside color Doppler ultrasonography showed liquid opacity in the right thoracic cavity and pericardium. And the patient experienced continuous decrease of oxygen saturation to around 60 % and his blood pressure decreased to around 70/50 mmHg. At that night, throat swabs by professionals from CDC showed positive and the diagnosis was defi ned to be human infection of H7N9 avian infl uenza virus. The patient was then transferred to the local hospital specialized in infectious diseases, and death occurred 1 week later. The patient reported a history of close contacts to feces of birds and chickens.",

Human infected H7N9 avian infl uenza virus is a newly emerging recombinant virus, which infects human via respiratory tract after contact to poultry with the infection. It has an incubation period of no more than 7 days. And the patients commonly experience fl u like symptoms, such as fever, cough, expectoration of a little sputum as well as accompanying headache, muscle soreness and general malaise. In severe cases, the condition progresses rapidly into severe pneumonia, mostly with a body temperature of above 39 \u00b0C, dyspnea and possibly accompanying bloody sputum. Severe pneumonia may further progresses rapidly into ARDS, mediastinal emphysema, sepsis, shock, consciousness disturbance, and acute renal damage. By chest radiology, the disease is characterized by primary lesions in one lung that gradually involve both lungs along with progression of the condition. In addition, the multiple lesions in both lungs show a multi-segmental and multi-lobar distribution. For this case, the patient had a history of close contacts to feces of birds, and the disease is radiologically characterized by infl ammation of lobes in one lung at its early stage. Along with the progression of the condition, both lungs are rapidly involved and ARDS fi nally occurred. The diagnosis was defi ned based on the fi nding of throat swabs to be a typical case of human infected H7N9 avian infl uenza. For this case, the condition should be differentiated from other types of pneumonia. Compared to other types of pneumonia, the patient in this case showed no obvious characteristic symptoms and physical signs and the defi nitive diagnosis is mainly based on the etiological examination.

Early after onset, the lesions may be confi ned within one lung, the most commonly the right lung. If both lungs involved, the lesions distribute in multiple segments and multiple lung lobes that are predominantly and more serious in the right lung. In addition, the lesions in both lower lungs are more serious than in both upper lungs, which is possibly related to the posture for radiology and the anatomy of trachea. Radiologically, both the parenchymal and interstitial lesions are demonstrated as large consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, and sporadic ground glass opacity, with air bronchogram. 3. During the progressive stage, human infected H7N9 avian infl uenza virus invades the lung tissues to induce the cytokine storm due to the absence of immunity to the new virus. Therefore, systematic infl ammatory responses are triggered, with subsequent occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock and multiple organs failure. Radiologically, the lesions in lungs rapidly develop to involve multiple segments and lobes. Due to diffuse alveolar damages, chest X-ray and CT scan demonstrate extensively distributed ground glass opacity and consolidation opacity in both lungs, with air bronchogram, predominantly in both lower lungs or the right upper lung.

The left lower lung was revealed with fl ake of consolidation and ground glass like high density opacity. Compared to the chest CT scan fi lm 3 days ago, the lesions signifi cantly progressed ( f ). On d 31 after onset, chest CT scan demonstrated absorbed consolidation opacity in the right lower lung lobe at the bronchial bifurcating level ( g ). The right lower lung lobe was revealed with GGO like opacity and interstitial fi brous cords like opacity near diaphragmatic dome. The left lingual lung lobe was revealed with GGO like opacity and interstitial fi brous cords like opacity ( ",
