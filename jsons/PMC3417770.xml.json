The low but detectable sequence similarity and the unusually high structural similarity between the three members of each family strongly suggest that they were derived from the same ancestral gene and have evolved to acquire functional diversity. Indeed, a putative TRAPPC3 ancestor has been reported in Ignicoccus hospitalis, an organism that does not possess either an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or a Golgi (2). In yeast, the TRS33 gene is dispensable probably because of the formation of a homodimer of Bet3p that can partly replace Bet3p\u2013Trs33p in TRAPP I (3). Structural similarity between subunits has also been recently reported for another tethering complex called exocyst. In that case, structural similarity was seen between long \u03b1\u2010helical rod\u2010like structures of Exo70p and the C\u2010terminal domains of Sec6p, Exo84p and Sec15 4, 5. Furthermore, structural similarities between subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) vesicle tethering complex have been speculated as well 4, 6, 7. Thus, structural similarities between the subunits of tethering factors appear to be an emerging common theme. Like the TRAPP subunits, each subunit in the other tethering complexes would play a distinctive role.",

This domain exhibits a barely detectable sequence homology with several PDZ domains, the highest similarity being with the sixth PDZ domain of InaD\u2010like protein. However, the sequence similarity is limited to the C\u2010terminal 40 residues, as observed by others (8). Furthermore, in TRAPPC4, this domain does not contain the Gly\u2010Leu\u2010Gly\u2010Phe signature sequence of classical PDZ domains. It is therefore referred to as the PDZ\u2010like (PDZL) domain. The PDZL domain is present in Caenorhabditis elegans and higher organisms (9). Because the PDZ domain is a protein\u2010interacting module and because the PDZL domain in the tetrameric complex contains a characteristic surface groove, it is likely to bind an internal sequence of an as\u2010yet\u2010unknown protein. The lack of interaction between the two vertebrate recombinant TRAPP I subcomplexes (see below) and the presence of the PDZL domain in TRAPPC4 are the two most unique features of the vertebrate complex when compared with yeast TRAPP I.",

This surface is composed of highly conserved residues that are exposed in the context of the TRAPPC2\u2013TRAPPC3\u2013TRAPPC5 subcomplex (9). One possibility is that this region binds a SNARE domain to regulate SNARE complex formation, thus linking TRAPP to SNAREs as has been reported for other vesicle tethering complexes 14, 15, 16, 17.",

            "text": "The crystal structure of TRAPPC3 and, more recently of Bet3p, revealed an interesting structural feature in which a hydrophobic channel is formed within the core of the protein that is accessible from the surface 18, 19. This hydrophobic channel is quite unique, and such a channel has only been reported in one other protein, ORF\u20109b, of the SARS coronavirus (20). The function of this feature is unknown, but a mutation in the yeast protein (bet3\u20104), which is composed of an A94L mutation within the channel and a carboxy terminal hemagglutinin tag, is temperature sensitive for growth and localizes to multiple membranes within the cell (19). Cai et al. confirmed the growth phenotype and further demonstrated that it is the combination of these two changes to the protein that accounts for the growth defect, suggesting an influence of the carboxy terminus on the function of the channel. This mutant underscores the fact that this channel plays some uncharacterized but critical role in the function of TRAPPC3/Bet3p. Heinemann and co\u2010workers (21) suggest that palmitoylation of TRAPPC3 allows for the insertion of an acyl chain into the channel, which stabilizes the structure of the protein. However, TRAPPC5/Trs31p and TRAPPC6/Trs33p, the two other TRAPP subunits that are structural homologues of TRAPPC3 9, 18, 19, 22, do not have such a channel, and it is unclear why only the TRAPPC3 protein would have it. Furthermore, mutation of the cysteine residue that is acylated in the recombinant TRAPPC3/Bet3p protein to a serine blocks acylation and displays no growth phenotype in yeast 19, 23. This strongly argues that there must be another purpose to this channel. One possibility suggested by Kim et al. (19) is that an acyl chain on an unidentified Golgi protein is inserted into the channel. Perhaps, the carboxy terminus of TRAPPC3/Bet3p is somehow involved in this insertion, providing an explanation as to why both modifications to the Bet3p protein are required to generate the phenotype of the bet3\u20104 allele.",

In these two subcomplexes, TRAPPC3 interacts with TRAPPC6 or TRAPPC5 using a common surface, and each heterodimer interacts with another subunit side by side to form flat subcomplexes. While the two mammalian subcomplexes do not interact with each other, the corresponding subcomplexes of yeast TRAPP I form a single tight complex when the six subunits were coexpressed (9). Single particle electron microscopy of this complex revealed that yeast TRAPP I has an elongated, flat architecture. Into the \u223c30 \u00c5 resolution three\u2010dimensional reconstituted image, the two structures of the mammalian subcomplexes could be nicely docked, providing a pseudo high\u2010resolution structure of TRAPP I (Figure 1B) (9).

The TRAPPC1 and TRAPPC4 subunits bridge the two ends of the complex and are required for interaction with the GTPase Ypt1p (see below). The positioning of TRAPPC2 is interesting as it is not involved in nucleotide exchange activity (9) or vesicle tethering (24) (see below). Therefore, the exposed relatively large surface area is available for potential interactions with other proteins involved in membrane transport as discussed above. The arrangement of the subunits within the complex is such that two large (\u223c180 \u00d7 65 \u00c5) flat surfaces are presented. Part of one or both of these surfaces will be occupied by the TRAPP II\u2010specific subunits, but exactly where they interact with this core of the TRAPP complex is still unknown. A recent study suggests that they overlap with the Ypt1p\u2010binding site (25). Now that the site of interaction between TRAPP I and Ypt1p has begun to be elucidated (18) (Figure 3); this theory can be put to the test.",

The Ypt6p\u2010GEF requires two proteins for its activity, Ric1p and Rgp1p (40). In contrast, Kim et al.

In this structure, Ypt1p is proximal to three domains of Trs23p (residues 10\u201315, 31\u201346 and 199\u2013203), one \u03b1\u2010helix of Bet5p and the C\u2010termini of both of the Bet3p subunits present in this complex (referred to as Bet3p\u2010A and Bet3p\u2010B) (Figure 2). Based on the difference between the five\u2010subunit structure and the previously published individual subunit structures, the authors proposed that Trs31p does not interact with Ypt1p but is important for the formation of the Ypt1p\u2013TRAPP I interface. The side view of the published structure (Figure 2A) together with analysis of putative TRAPP I\u2013Ypt1p interactions using a 4.0 \u00c5 distance cut\u2010off fails to unequivocally identify the critical residues that stabilize the complex. However, sequence analysis of the proposed Ypt1p contact patches on Trs23p, Bet5p and Bet3p shows that all the patches are remarkably conserved from yeast to humans (Figure 3). While the patch conservation supports the structural model, finer structure resolution and binding analysis of Ypt1p with relevant TRAPP I subunit mutations are required for nailing down the specific interactions.",

            "text": "The general model for the mechanism by which GEFs stimulate GDP release involves conformational changes in the two switch domains and the P\u2010loop of the GTPase (41). Based on the Ypt1p\u2013TRAPP I structure, Cai et al. (18) propose a mechanism for stimulation of GDP release from Ypt1p by TRAPP I. First, they propose that three of the five TRAPP subunits in the complex are important for Ypt1p binding: namely Trs23p, Bet5p and Bet3p. Second, they suggest that Bet5p links Trs23p and Bet3p\u2010A and is important for directing the C\u2010terminus of Bet3p\u2010A to the Ypt1p nucleotide\u2010binding pocket. Analysis of mutations in these domains in Trs23p and Bet5p supports their importance for GEF activity 9, 18. However, it is not clear yet whether these mutations affect complex assembly, Ypt1p binding or GDP release. Finally, Cai et al. assign the critical catalytic activity to the C\u2010terminus of Bet3p\u2010A, proposing that it is inserted into the GTP\u2010binding pocket of Ypt1p and functions as a \u2018wedge\u2019 to initiate the conformational change required for GDP release. Indeed, when a GTP molecule is docked into the published structure (Figure 2C), it is clear that residues from the C\u2010terminus of Bet3p\u2010A occupy a similar position to that of the phosphate groups of the nucleotide. However, mutations altering the charge have no effect on GEF activity, and deletion of the whole C\u2010terminus does not affect cell growth. In addition, the tested Bet3p mutations might instead affect the second Bet3p molecule, Bet3p\u2010B, and its interaction with Trs23p and Ypt1p. Thus, the mechanistic aspect of the GEF activity of TRAPP will have to be addressed in future studies.",

TRAPP purified from yeast lysates was shown to act as a GEF for Ypt31/32p (34). This TRAPP contains a mixture of TRAPP I and TRAPP II, and further purification revealed the TRAPP II complex exhibiting this activity. Moreover, mutations in the two essential TRAPP II\u2010specific subunits, Trs120p and Trs130p, abolish the Ypt31/32p GEF activity of TRAPP while increasing the Ypt1p GEF activity (25). This last result shows that the TRAPP II\u2010specific subunits are required for the Ypt31/32p GEF activity and for the inhibition of the Ypt1p GEF activity of TRAPP II. This biochemical activity has been controversial in the field because of discrepant results between two research groups 18, 35, 45. This may be because of differences in complex purification and GEF assay conditions. Because TRAPP purified from yeast lysates contains both complexes, it is possible that conditions used by the Ferro\u2010Novick group during purification or assaying of the GEF activity favor dissociation of the TRAPP II\u2010specific subunits, thus yielding mostly TRAPP I that has only a Ypt1p\u2010GEF activity. Alternatively, it is possible that TRAPP II purified by the Segev group contains additional unknown subunits required for the Ypt31/32p GEF activity.

The two bacterially expressed reconstituted vertebrate subcomplexes do not exhibit GEF activity either alone or in combination (unpublished data). We speculate that the reason for this lack of activity is because the GEF activity of the reconstituted yeast TRAPP I requires the presence of four subunits, Bet3p, Trs31p, Bet5p and Trs23p, in one complex, whereas their vertebrate counterparts are present on the two separate subcomplexes. Therefore, one obvious question to be addressed is why would the vertebrate subcomplexes not readily associate with each other? In the yeast TRAPP I holocomplex, Bet3p\u2013Trs31p forms an interface for binding Trs23p, thereby linking the Bet3p\u2013Trs20p\u2013Trs31p and Bet3p\u2013Trs33p\u2013Bet5p\u2013Trs23p subcomplexes together.

We suggest that this insertion may be responsible for preventing the two vertebrate subcomplexes from interacting with each other. It is noteworthy that the SVPK sequence is also found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Trs31p, however the assembly state of TRAPP in this organism is presently unknown. It is possible that an additional unknown subunit bridges the two vertebrate subcomplexes to form a catalytically active complex. It is also possible that a posttranslational modification is required for the assembly and/or the Rab\u2010GEF activity of the vertebrate TRAPP. Alternatively, vertebrate TRAPP I may not have GEF activity at all, and a yet unknown protein is present in vertebrate cells to activate the Ypt1p orthologue Rab1. So far, TRAPP I is the only known GEF for Ypt1p. Based on the conservation of Ypt/Rabs and TRAPP in general and specifically the remarkable conservation of the proposed Ypt1p contact patches on the TRAPP I subunits (Figure 3), we expect that the mammalian TRAPP complex acts as a Rab1\u2010GEF.",

Its role as a tether in this transport step was established by showing that TRAPP I interacts directly with ER\u2010derived vesicles produced using either a crude cytosolic fraction or purified COP II coat components (36). How does TRAPP I interact with vesicles? It was recently reported that ER\u2010derived vesicles bind to TRAPP I through an interaction between the Bet3p subunit and the vesicle coat protein Sec23p (24). This was a surprising result for two reasons. First, it was long assumed that vesicles rapidly uncoat following inactivation of Sar1p by hydrolysis of bound GTP (51). This uncoating is catalyzed by the GTPase\u2010activating protein activity of Sec23p towards Sar1p (52). Using a liposome system, Sato and Nakano (53) showed that the Sec23p/Sec24p complex remains associated with prebudding complexes because of constant reactivation of Sar1p by its GEF, Sec12p. Although Sec12p is not found in transport vesicles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, other factors may stabilize the association of Sec23p with free vesicles as has been suggested to happen in Pichia pastoris and higher eukaryotes 54, 55. Second, an earlier study showed that TRAPP I can bind to COP II vesicles in vitro, but the interaction was blocked by the inclusion of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog (36). The latter result was interpreted as a requirement for vesicle uncoating before the TRAPP I interaction. If, however, sufficient amounts of Sec23p remain associated with free vesicles, then the previous result may reflect the fact that other GTPases are involved in the tethering of these vesicles. In agreement with this idea, it has been shown that the protein GDI interferes with vesicle tethering (56) and GDI binds to the non\u2010activated (GDP\u2010bound) form of the GTPase Ypt1p. However, Ypt1p activation is necessary for vesicle fusion (57). Because Ypt1p is reportedly associated with vesicles (58), it is plausible that premature activation of Ypt1p interferes with vesicle tethering and its GDP\u2010bound form participates in tethering. In this scenario, activated Ypt1p would recruit other factors to the site of the tethered vesicle to further strengthen the tether or aid in SNARE complex assembly.",

One possibility is that the TRAPP II\u2010specific subunits block the site of interaction between Bet3p and Sec23p. A recent study suggests that the TRAPP II subunit Trs120p is required for the stability of the Trs130p subunit, suggesting that these two proteins might interact (25). Therefore, it seems unlikely that Trs120p and Trs130p independently block both copies of Bet3p from interacting with Sec23p. Furthermore, Uso1p has been reported to be involved in the initial tethering of vesicles to the Golgi in yeast (56) and proteins in mammalian cells such as p115 and GM130 are also involved in this process 59, 60. A likely possibility is that there are multiple means for a vesicle to be tethered to the Golgi involving TRAPP, Uso1p, coat proteins and most likely other proteins, each being critical to the process such that disruption of one of these interactions weakens the overall vesicle\u2013membrane interaction.",

            "text": "While the bulk of studies on yeast have focused on the smaller TRAPP I complex, given the relatedness between TRAPP I and TRAPP II, it will be important to more fully characterize the larger complex. Several studies have begun to address the transport step in which TRAPP II functions. Mutants in yeast, trs130 and trs120, were shown to accumulate early Golgi forms of invertase. In addition, the trs130 mutants also accumulated early Golgi forms of carboxypeptidase Y as well as Berkeley bodies, all suggestive of a block in traffic beyond the ER\u2010to\u2010Golgi step (36). Interestingly, a subsequent study in which a variety of truncations in trs120 were examined showed that some alleles affected traffic between the endosome and the trans Golgi (43). Not all proteins that rely on a functional endosome\u2010to\u2010trans Golgi pathway were affected in these mutants. For example, carboxypeptidase Y was not affected in trs120\u20102, trs120\u20104 and trs120\u20108, yet other proteins such as Snc1p\u2013green fluorescent protein (GFP) were blocked. This led to the conclusion that Trs120p functions in traffic between the early endosome and the trans Golgi, a notion that fits well with its GEF activity for Ypt31/32p (61). However, the same study showed that mutations in trs130 can block secretion in general and affect localization of both carboxypeptidase Y and Snc1p\u2013GFP (43). This would indicate a complex function for TRAPP II in multiple pathways, and clarification of its function awaits further studies. In addition, it has been shown that the Golgi\u2010associated retrograde protein (GARP) tethering complex also functions at the trans Golgi (62), and understanding the differing roles of TRAPP II and GARP will be of interest. The TRAPP II\u2010specific Trs65p subunit has no known mammalian orthologue (Table 1) and is presumed to have a fungal\u2010specific function. While it has been implicated in cell wall biogenesis and stress response, its role in TRAPP II is supported by the findings that the protein colocalizes with Trs130p and deletion of TRS65 in yeast leads to a conditional lethal phenotype if either one of the other TRAPP II\u2010specific subunits is modified (44). Furthermore, the trs65 mutant has reduced Ypt31/32p GEF activity.",

The mammalian complex was proposed to be involved in homotypic fusion of ER\u2010derived COP II vesicles (71). This was based on the localization of the TRAPPC3 subunit to transitional ER sites and the inhibition of COP II vesicle fusion in an in vitro assay that reconstitutes this event. Given the well\u2010documented interaction between COP II vesicles and Golgi in yeast, this would imply that the mammalian TRAPP complex functions by a different mechanism than its yeast counterpart. It is noteworthy, however, that the same antibody used to interfere with the homotypic fusion assay was reported to inefficiently precipitate the native form of the protein (24). This raises the question as to how such an antibody can interfere in an assay that presumably requires native TRAPPC3. One possibility is that a TRAPPC3 epitope not normally exposed in the context of the entire complex is exposed in the homotypic fusion assay. This would imply that only TRAPPC3, and not the TRAPP complex per se, is involved in this tethering event. Future studies should be aimed at resolving this issue.",

In one (9), the complex is proposed to lay flat on Golgi membranes and interact with an incoming vesicle. A second model (18) suggests that the complex does not lay flat upon membranes but rather the two copies of the TRAPPC3/Bet3p subunit bridge two membranes. The main difference between the models is that the first model seeks to explain heterotypic fusion, while the latter model seeks to explain homotypic fusion, a function that may be specific to the mammalian complex or to TRAPPC3. Indeed, Cai et al. (18) speculate that the arrangement of the complex with respect to membranes is similar between the two types of fusion events, a notion that is as yet unproven. It is entirely possible that the arrangement of the complex with respect to membranes is as different as the fusion events themselves (i.e. homotypic versus heterotypic). Evidence suggesting possible differing functions for the subunits in yeast and mammals is the fact that while two forms of TRAPP have been described in yeast, only a single high\u2010molecular\u2010weight peak on a gel filtration column has been reported in mammalian cells 68, 70. Furthermore, homotypic fusion has not been reported in yeast. In that case, these models are not necessarily mutually exclusive and indeed may reflect the evolutionary needs of the complex to mediate two different types of fusion events. As more work on TRAPP is performed, it is likely that refinement of both models will be needed.",

This disorder primarily affects the epiphyses and manifests in early adolescent males. Affected individuals suffer from back pain and dysplasia of the large joints and are below the average family height, the latter being because of a flattening of the vertebrae. Subsequent studies have linked numerous mutations in TRAPPC2 to SEDT including missense mutations, truncations and RNA splicing mutations (84). It has been reported that patients with this disorder have extracellular collagen fibrils that are shorter and more frayed than unaffected patients (85), leading to the hypothesis that a defect in collagen trafficking in chondrocytes is responsible for the disorder 85, 86. However, several pieces of evidence suggest that the role of TRAPPC2 in SEDT may not be that simple. First, there is no evidence that patients suffering from SEDT have any other membrane traffic defects. This is unexpected considering that TRAPPC2 is widely expressed. Second, if TRAPPC2 is only involved in collagen trafficking, one would expect defects in other collagen\u2010secreting cells. Again, this has also not been reported. Finally, one study showed that mutated TRAPPC2 accumulated in the nucleus (87), suggesting that TRAPPC2 may have an undescribed nuclear function that should be taken into account when seeking to describe the tissue\u2010specific defect of SEDT. In this respect, it is noteworthy that TRAPPC2 has been identified as MIP\u20102A, a protein involved in the regulation of gene transcription 66, 72. While it has been suggested that TRAPPC2 is involved in guanine nucleotide exchange based on its structural similarity to signal recognition particle receptor \u03b2(88), it has recently been demonstrated that its yeast orthologue, Trs20p, is not necessary for the Ypt1p\u2010directed nucleotide exchange function (9). How then is TRAPPC2 involved in the etiology of SEDT? This remains an open question, but a particular mutation could eventually be revealing. One affected patient has an Asp47\u2192Tyr mutation that, based on the structure of TRAPPC2 in the context of the TRAPP complex, is exposed on the surface of the protein and is not involved in any interaction between TRAPP subunits (9). This particular mutation does not efficiently compensate for the loss of Trs20p in yeast, whereas wild\u2010type TRAPPC2 does (89) suggesting a conserved function for this residue. Indeed, Asp47 is highly conserved 10, 89. Therefore, identification of TRAPPC2\u2010interacting partners, particularly those that are affected by mutation of Asp47, will be an important step in understanding the link between TRAPPC2 and SEDT.",

To demonstrate the incompatibility between the C\u2010terminal region (wedge) of Bet3p\u2010A with the presence of nucleotide on Ypt1p when in complex with TRAPP, a GTP analog (GppNHp) was docked to the Ypt1p\u2013TRAPP I complex based on its position in the structure of Ypt1p\u2010GTP (PDB ID 1YZN). Note how residues from the C\u2010terminus of Bet3p\u2010A occupy a similar position to that of the phosphate groups of the nucleotide. Figure prepared with Molscript.",
