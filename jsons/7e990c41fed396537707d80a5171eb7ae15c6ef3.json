            "text": "In its more severe forms, COVID-19 progresses towards an excessive immune response, leading to the systemic overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines like IL6, mostly from the infected lungs. This cytokine storm can cause multiple organ damage and death. Consequently, there is a pressing need to identify therapies to treat and prevent severe symptoms during COVID-19. Based on previous clinical evidence, we hypothesized that inhibiting T cell co-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an effective therapeutic strategy against progression to severe proinflammatory states. To support this hypothesis, we performed an analysis integrating blood transcriptional data we generated from rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept -a CD80/86 costimulation inhibitor-with the pathological features associated with COVID-19, particularly in its more severe forms. We have found that many of the biological processes that have been consistently associated with COVID-19 pathology are reversed by CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibition, including the downregulation of IL6 production. Also, analysis of previous transcriptional data from blood of SARS-CoVinfected patients showed that the response to abatacept has a very high level of antagonism to that elicited by COVID-19. Finally, analyzing a recent single cell RNA-seq dataset from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients, we found a significant correlation along the main elements of the C80/86 axis: CD86+/80+ antigen presenting cells, activated CD4+ T cells and IL6 production. Our in-silico study provides additional support to the hypothesis that blocking of the CD80/CD86 signaling axis may be protective of the excessive proinflammatory state associated with COVID-19 in the lungs.",

Single cell analysis on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients suggest that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages substitute alveolar macrophages in the lung during inflammation (17). In either case, how macrophages drastically increase the proinflammatory levels in COVID-19 is yet not known (8) . High levels of Tcell mediated activation could be one of the possible causes. In turn, T cells could become hyperactivated due to excessive activation through the CD80/86 axis ( Figure   1 ). Therefore, dampening this activation signaling pathway could be an effective therapeutic approach to prevent immune system hyperactivation, and progress to more severe stages. To support this hypothesis raised by the findings of our previous epidemiological survey in rheumatic patients, here we performed an in-silico study using transcriptional data from abatacept-treated patients as well as from COVID-19 patients.",

Even CTLA4 itself is highly expressed in the lung compared to the rest of tissues.

We have shown this by two complementary strategies. In the first strategy we have found that, from the most well-established pathological processes associated with COVID-19 to date, abatacept induces a transcriptional change that is contrary to the one induced by the virus in most of them. In a first group of processes related to innate immune system detection of SARS-CoV2 we found that treatment with abatacept downregulates TLRsignaling pathway and endosomal transport. TLRs are key to detect the presence of the virus, leading to the activation of proinflammatory transcription factors and the expression of IFN and other cytokines(46). While viral detection is essential to trigger the immune response in the first stages of the infection, later its utility might be superseded by the need to adequately control excessive inflammatory response (5) . To this regard, our analysis did not detect a strong type I IFN inhibition, thereby suggesting that this basic anti-viral mechanism is protected. Of interest, we found a significant downregulation of endosomal transport, a biological process that has been linked to the possible protective of hydroxychloroquine in . A reduction endosomal development and maturation would keep at stake viral load. However, the confirmation of this mechanism in relation to SARS-CoV2 infection and the clinical protection are still controversial and are in need of robust evidence (47).",

The latter might not activate in many infected patients, but likely occurs in most of those who progress to more severe symptoms, particularly those with increasing lung inflammation. This stage is characterized by the activation of myeloid cells, mostly monocyte-derived macrophages that massively infiltrate the lung (8) . We have found that treatment with CTLA4-Ig significantly downregulates myeloid leukocyte differentiation and macrophage activation. This specific antiinflammatory role could be a useful property to avoid entering into the life-threatening massive cytokine release stage. To this regard, we have found that abatacept downregulated both the production and the response to several key cytokines of the severe stage in COVID-19 including TNF (48), IL1 (33), IL8 (49), IL7 (48) and IL6 (48). Importantly, we have found that downregulation is strong for IL6, the cytokine that is more abundantly produced in patients progressing to severity both in serum and in the lungs (45). Therapies aimed at IL6 signaling, tocilizumab and sarilumab, are currently being evaluated in at least three clinical trials by 11 th May 2020, and there is increasing reporting of beneficial effects in off-label use in severe patients (50). In line with this, our previous epidemiological study, both CD80/86 blocking and anti-IL6R therapies showed the lowest incidence of COVID-19 suspected cases among rheumatic patients (13) .",

The downregulation of the B cell mediated response, could also be beneficial to avoid overactivation of the myeloid compartment. While neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV are associated to a reduction in the viral load (51), there is also the possibility that high titers antibodies could lead to a more aggressive immunological response. During the SARS-CoV1 epidemic, neutralizing antibody levels were higher in deceased patients (52), which raised the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) contributing to disease exacerbation. In this situation, non-neutralizing antibodies facilitate the phagocytosis of the virus into macrophage through the Fc-receptor leading to their activation into proinflammatory phenotypes (53). ADE has been previously identified in other coronaviruses (54)(55), and experimental evidence in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV1 found that anti-spike IgG antibodies contributed to massive influx of monocytes in the lung and subsequent severe acute injury (56). In this context, the effect of reducing B cell immunity by abatacept might be beneficial by reducing the likelihood of low-affinity antibodies that would contribute to ADE-induction (7). To this regard, evidence showing that antibodies raised against SARS-Cov2 can lead to ADE would be of high relevance, particularly in the development of safe vaccines.",

For example, the Global Rheumatology Alliance (57), an international collaborative initiative that is currently aggregating data from patients around the world, will likely become an ideal resource to confirm the observed lower atrisk incidence in abatacept-treated rheumatic patients (13) . Among the limitations of this study is that our analysis of transcriptional changes due to abatacept could have been confounded by the specific immune activation that is due to RA. Like SARS, however, RA is a disease where macrophage IL6 production is central to the pathology (58). Of relevance, there is increasing evidence that abatacept could be an efficacious therapy to treat interstitial lung disease in RA (ILD) (59). ILD is a comorbidity that occurs in RA patients and is characterized by the inflammation and subsequent fibrotic development of the lung tissue. Treatment with abatacept was motivated by the finding that blocking T cell co-stimulation through CTLA4-Ig is effective in a mouse model of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (60), a disease characterized by a massive influx of activated T cells in the lungs and where alveolar macrophages express high levels of B7 (CD80/CD86) molecules. This evidence is in line with our hypothesis that the CD80/86 axis is a key factor for lung hyperinflammatory response. Additionally, while immunosuppressive agents are generally associated with an increase in the risk of infectious diseases in rheumatic patients (61), abatacept has shown to be the therapy that least increases this risk. There is substantial epidemiological evidence supporting that abatacept-treated patients do not increase the risk of serious infections (62)(63)(64). Our finding that abatacept-treated patients have a lower percentage of COVID-19 symptoms, prompted us to provide additional evidence of the benefit of this therapeutic approach. After characterizing the transcriptional changes induced by the therapy in a cohort of RA patients, we have seen that it is highly antagonistic to that induced by COVID-19, both to several of the most well-known pathological processes associated with the disease, and to the biological processes that are differentially activated in samples of patients. Together, this evidence identifies blocking of the CD80/86 axis as a candidate therapy for COVID-19. To this regard, Belatacept, a CTLA4-Ig drug derived from abatacept that binds more avidly to CD80/86 and is used to prevent renal transplant rejection (65) ",

However, there's yet no epidemiological evidence evaluating this drug in relation to COVID-19, with only sporadic reporting (66).While the development of vaccines and the questions like permanency of immunization are still being investigated, there is a need to find therapies that can lower the risk of progressing to severe stages of COVID-19 and reduce the number of fatalities during the next months or years. Additional clinical and experimental evidence gathered in the next months will be crucial to confirm if blocking of the CD80/86 axis is a useful therapeutic approach to prevent progression to severe stages of the disease.Abatacept for rheumatoid arthritis refractory to tumor necrosis factor $Alten R, Mariette X, Buch M, Caporali R, Flipo R-M, Forster A, et al.

Schematics depicting the model for abataceptmediated inhibition of excess cytokine production. Once lungs become infected with SARS-CoV2 virus, an immune response is mounted. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the lung present antigen to activated CD4+ T cells thereby stimulating their production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL6). Resident alveolar macrophages and, mostly, large numbers of infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages respond to the T cell stimulation by producing large quantities of interleukins, mainly IL6. Large numbers of activated macrophages present in the lung can lead to systemic secretion of IL6, forming the cytokine storm. Treatment with CTLA4-Ig recombinant fusion protein could dampen APC activation of T cells and, therefore, reduce the level of hyperinflammatory response observed in severe COVID-16 patients.",
