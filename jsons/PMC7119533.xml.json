Since then, the PVDA has been further developed and includes, in its latest version, 36,000 oligonucleotides probes targeting approximately 1500 distinct viral genomes (Chen et al., 2011). This technology has been used to rapidly identify viruses involved in human illness, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Wang et al., 2003), and in animal diseases (Chen et al., 2011). Use of this technology is of interest as the results can be generally obtained within a day and does not require other advanced technologies for results interpretation (Chen et al., 2011). However, PVDA is dependent on the selected probes it contains and their tolerance to nucleotide mismatch during the DNA hybridization process required for the detection and identification of viruses in a clinical sample (Delwart, 2012).",

It has even led to the discovery of unforeseen viruses in clinical samples (Bellehumeur et al., 2013). Metagenomic sequencing has the potential to determine the entirety of the nucleic acid sequences within a sample, including viral nucleic sequences of interest (Hall et al., 2014). The metagenomic DNA sequences obtained with HTS are then compared to a genomic database in order to identify the nucleic acid sequences associated with known viruses (Firth and Lipkin, 2013). One major benefit to metagenomic sequencing of clinical samples is the potential to detect and assemble the genome of novel viruses (Barzon et al., 2013).",

The high host to viral DNA ratio in extracted clinical samples greatly decreases PVDA sensitivity since most of the amplified labeled DNA corresponds to host DNA (Kang et al., 2011). For sequencing, depending on the method of tissue preparation and viral particle concentration, again the high host to viral DNA ratio decreases the sensitivity of the technology (Yang et al., 2011). As more reads must be obtained in order to detect the presence of a virus in a clinical sample, this can increase sequencing costs and lower throughput while creating a potential bioinformatics bottleneck. Thus, in order to improve viral detection in clinical samples with HTS and PVDA, the levels of host genomic DNA must be lowered. This is generally done by treating samples with a combination of ultracentrifugation, filtration and/or nuclease treatment (typically DNase and/or RNase treatment) (Hall et al., 2014, Clem et al., 2007). As these methods can introduce bias in viral identification (9) the development of alternative methods to lower host genomic material in clinical samples is of interest.",

Both are azide-bearing, DNA/RNA-intercalating dyes that only cross damaged lipid membrane barriers. Both dyes can bind and covalently crosslink DNA/RNA when the azide group is converted to a highly reactive nitrene radical upon exposure to bright visible light. Thereafter, they are easily inactivated and the unbound inactivated EMA/PMA remains free in solution. EMA/PMA-generated DNA/RNA cross-linking strongly inhibits reverse-transcription and PCR amplification of the EMA/PMA modified genomes while unmodified genomes from presumptively living bacteria (which possesses intact membranes) can be amplified (Codony et al., 2012a). Interestingly, EMA/PMA treatments have been used to distinguish infectious from non-infectious viruses such as Hepatitis A virus, coxsakievirus, echovirus, norovirus and poliovirus, suggesting that intact virus particles have the potential to protect their genetic material from EMA/PMA chemicals (Elizaquivel et al., 2014).",

Sera of non-infected and infected piglets were collected at different time post-infection (pi) and kept at \u221270 \u00b0C until needed. Viral load in samples was determined with a specific PRRSV RT-qPCR assay as previously described (Bellehumeur et al., 2013). Lung samples were collected at necropsy at 28 days pi and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until needed. Three infected lung samples (PRRSV titers: (1) 4929, (2) 4336 and (3) 9408 TCID50/g) were selected. Two sera samples were selected from PRRSV positive clinical sera samples (PRRSV titers of (1) 1059 and (2) 7413 TCID50/mL) submitted to the Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory (MDL) of the University of Montreal were selected and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until needed. PRRSV negative swine lung samples or PRRSV negative swine sera samples were spiked with a known quantity of the PRRSV IAF-Klop strain to a final concentration of either 5000 TCID50/mL or 50,000 TCID50/mL. Lung tissue samples (spiked samples or PRRSV positive clinical samples; 100 mg of tissue in 1 mL of PBS with glass beads) were homogenized twice for 5 min in a Mini BeadBeater 96 Homogenizer, centrifuged 1 min at 10,000 rpm in a table top centrifuge and kept at 4 \u00b0C until used. Serum samples (spiked samples or PRRSV positive clinical samples) were kept at 4 \u00b0C once thawed.",

Using this concentration, the effect of EMA or PMA treatments on virus genome's presence and host genomic DNA was further evaluated in tissue samples spiked with known quantities of PRRSV (5000 TCID50/mL or 50,000 TCID50/mL) but also in serum samples spiked with the same PRRSV quantities. Results with lung homogenates spiked with both concentration of PRRSV indicate that EMA and PMA treatments significantly lowered PRRSV detection compared to non-treated samples (Fig. 1A; P\n < 0.001 and P\n < 0.05 respectively). However, PRRSV detection was more negatively affected following EMA treatment (Fig. 1A; P\n < 0.01), indicating that PMA treatments have less negative impact on RT-qPCR PRRSV detection as observed in the preliminary experiment. Ultracentrifugation had a significant positive impact on PRRSV detection in lung tissue homogenates spiked with either concentration of PRRSV following EMA treatment (Fig. 1A; P\n < 0.001).

Surprisingly, probes signals intensity and positivity were varying between experiments. For lung samples spiked with PRRSV (5000 TCID50/mL), a low number of slightly positive probes (probes relative signal intensity <5) were detected in untreated samples (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, multiple probes with relative high fluorescence intensity (>5) were detected following PMA treatment when combined with ultracentrifugation and were associated with a significantly higher number of positive probes compared to untreated samples with ultracentrifugation and the PMA treated samples without ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2A; P\n < 0.001). In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of detected positive probes of EMA-treated lung homogenates spiked with PRRSV (5000 TCID50/mL) were significantly lower than all other experimental groups, indicating a lower chance to detect positive probes following treatment with EMA (P\n < 0.05; Fig. 2A).",

A strong correlation was found between PRRSV percent of coverage and the higher number of reads following treatment (r\n = 0.81, P\n < 0.001), indicating that the increase in PRRSV coverage is related to the augmentation in PRRSV reads.

Our results support an increase in sensitivity of PVDA and HTS in lung tissue samples treated with PMA and, to a lesser extent, with EMA. This treatment can be done as a standalone treatment or in combination with other treatments like ultracentrifugation. Surprisingly, adding an ultracentrifugation step before the EMA or PMA treatment sometimes lowers the sensitivity of both PVDA and HTS. This is probably caused by a physical degradation of viral particles during ultracentrifugation, making these particles more sensitive to EMA or PMA treatment.",

            "text": "Interestingly, our results indicate a higher sensitivity of PVDA and HTS with sera samples, compared to tissue homogenates. This may be explained by two phenomena. Firstly, there is a lower concentration of hg/cont in sera samples compared to tissue homogenates, as demonstrated by \u03b2-actin DNA measurements for both untreated sera samples and tissue homogenates. Secondly, the random amplification method used to increase the amount of DNA for both HTS and PVDA techniques amplify all nucleic DNA and RNA sequences found in a sample, including hg/cont. Thus, the sensitivity of both PVDA and HTS will be highly affected by the ratio of the viral genetic material of interest over the total amount of hg/cont found in samples. This indicates that the initial amount of hg/cont in clinical samples has a deep impact on PVDA and HTS sensitivity for the identification of viruses. The variation in hg/cont content within nucleic acid extraction from clinical samples may explain the high standard deviation obtained within the results of PVDA and HTS with lung tissue homogenates spiked with the lowest PRRSV concentration. This variation can be explained by multiple factors like the extraction method, the tissue quality and the homogenization process. Also, the virus integrity in clinical samples will have to be taken into account to avoid virus particle degradation during the tissue manipulation, storage and homogenization, which can sensitize viral particles to EMA or PMA treatment. This is especially true for clinical samples where the virus type, the integrity of tissue (dead animal, sample conservation at room temperature, etc.), the amount of hg/cont or the presence of PCR inhibitors will have an critical impact on PVDA and HTS sensitivity. In addition, the efficiency of the random amplification process could be affected by the viral genome itself (its sequence and its secondary structures), making some viral genomes less compatible with the use of random amplification prior to HTS and PVDA (Codony et al., 2012b). It is important to note that our work utilized a unique virus, and does not take into account the efficiency of EMA and PMA treatments on other types of viruses. However, the outer structure of the virions of several viruses can protect the viral genetic material from PMA treatment (Elizaquivel et al., 2014), suggesting that this treatment should reduce the influence of hg/cont when used for clinical samples with other virus types.",

However, Mishra and collaborators (2014) showed a ratio (viral reads/total number of reads) of 0.00012% by HTS from muscle tissue samples (Mishra et al., 2014). In this study, rRNA was depleted and a DNase treatment was done following the RNA extraction, in order to lower hg/cont in that clinical sample (Mishra et al., 2014). These results are in accordance with our work since the percentage of PRRSV specific reads ranged between 0% and 0.00059% in spiked untreated samples and between 0% and 0.19785% in EMA and PMA-treated spiked samples. In contrast, Djikeng and collaborators (2008) have reported much higher ratios of host genomic content to isolated virus ranging between 3 and 40% (Djikeng et al., 2008) while Nakamura and collaborators (2009) have reported higher genomic content ranging between 90.0% and 94.6% (Nakamura et al., 2009). The variation of the host genomic DNA content between those studies is probably explained by the difference in purification and treatment methods used for each virus, like the use of gradient density centrifugation to obtained highly purified viruses with lower hg/cont (Djikeng et al., 2008). The ratio of host genomic DNA content reported in our study varied between 67.50% and 77.40% in untreated samples and between 40.91% and 72.76% in EMA and PMA-treated samples. This represents an improvement over the results reported by Nakamura and collaborators (2009) where no purification methods were used, and less than the ratio of hg/cont reported by Djikeng and collaborators (2008). However, in the last case, the viruses were isolated from cell culture and the virions were subsequently purified.",

Furthermore, EMA/PMA treatments are faster and easier to perform than a nuclease treatment. Firstly, they require shorter incubation times compared to nuclease treatment which would result in faster processing of clinical samples in a diagnostic laboratory, and should increase the robustness of the method by exerting less stress on temperature sensitive viral particles. Secondly, EMA and PMA are easy to inactivate through light exposure, subsequently leaving EMA/PMA molecules unable to destroy newly exposed viral genomic material following nucleic acid extraction, unlike the case when residual nucleases may still be present after nucleic acid purification steps. This is especially true if RNase or DNase treatment is being used in the presence of RNA or DNA viruses, respectively. PMA/EMA treatments were more effective in tissue samples compared to sera samples which was presumably due to lower hg/cont in the latter. PMA was more effective than EMA in improving HTS and PVDA sensitivity for viral detection in clinical samples. This would be explained by the fact that EMA can leak through phospholipid bilayer membrane (Nocker et al., 2006). Moreover, ultracentrifugation appears to lower the sensitivity of HTS and PVDA following some treatments, possibly because of direct physical degradation of the viral particle. In conclusion, pre-treatment of clinical samples with EMA, and especially PMA, represents an interesting novel approach that improves PVDA and HTS sensitivity for the identification of viruses from clinical samples.",
