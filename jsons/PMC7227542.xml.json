Based on a shared decision-making process, all parents have the option to completely stop NAM therapy or use only lip tapping. Given that each patient is at a particular stage within the continuum of NAM care, numerous patient- and parent-derived issues are being addressed by video-mediated consultations. Overall, this has helped explain the current COVID-19-related public health recommendations and precautions to parents, while addressing patients\u2019 needs and parents\u2019 feelings, fears, expectations, and answering parents\u2019 questions. Moreover, clinical support is provided to patients and parents by visual inspection (looking for potential NAM-derived facial irritation), and checking parents\u2019 hand-hold maneuvers, such as feeding and placement of the lip tapping and NAM device, with immediate feedback for corrections. Thus, the use of an audiovisual communication tool has considerably reduced the number of in-person consultations.",

As most of the issues addressed in the video conversations were recurrent reasons for consultations prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, future investigations could assist in truly defining the key aspects of telemedicine-based clinician-patient/parent relationship in delivering NAM therapy, and its impact on NAM-related proxy-reported and clinician-derived outcome measures.",
