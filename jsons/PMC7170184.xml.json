In 1993, in the four corners area of the southwestern United States, there occurred a small outbreak of cases of acute pulmonary illness with a high mortality. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigation rapidly identified the causal agent, a previously unknown hantavirus, now named Sin Nombre virus (SNV). SNV is an indigenous virus of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that are persistently infected and excrete the virus. Apparently deer mice produce virus-infected excreta and, when they infest human dwellings, aerosolized fomites can result in occasional human infections. The 1993 outbreak is thought to reflect a transient rise in deer mouse populations associated with an unusual crop of pine nuts, a major food source for these rodents. The recognition of SNV soon led to the discovery of other heretofore unrecognized hantaviruses in North, Central and South America, many of which also cause serious human disease.",

Poliomyelitis first appeared as a cause of summer outbreaks of acute infantile paralysis in Sweden and the United States late in the nineteenth century (Figure 1\n). Isolated cases of infantile paralysis had been recorded in prior centuries, and an Eygptian tomb painting indicates that poliomyelitis probably occurred in early recorded history. Why then did poliomyelitis emerge abruptly as an epidemic disease? When personal hygiene and public health were primitive, poliovirus circulated as a readily transmitted enterovirus, and most infants were infected while they still carried maternal antibodies (up to 9\u201312 months of age). Under these circumstances, the virus produced immunizing infections of the enteric tract, but passively acquired circulating antibodies prevented invasion of the spinal cord. With the improvement of personal hygiene in the late-nineteenth century, infections were delayed until 1\u20133 years of age, after the waning of maternal antibodies. Infections now occurred in susceptible children, resulting in outbreaks of infantile paralysis. This reconstruction is supported by seroepidemiological studies conducted in North Africa in the 1950s, when epidemic poliomyelitis first emerged in this region.",

An outbreak of lethal avian influenza in Pennsylvania in 1983 is one documented example. In eastern Pennsylvania, avian influenza appeared in chicken farms early in 1983, but the virus was relatively innocuous and most infections were mild. However, in the fall of that year a fatal influenza pandemic spread rapidly through the same farms. When viruses from the spring and fall were compared, it appeared that both isolates had almost identical genomes. The fall virus had acquired a single point mutation in the viral hemagglutinin that facilitated the cleavage of the hemagglutinin. The virus could now replicate outside the respiratory tract, markedly increasing its virulence (discussed in Chapter 7, Patterns of infection). This point mutation led to the emergence of an overwhelming epizootic, which was only controlled by a widespread slaughter program involving millions of birds. Similar outbreaks of avian influenza have occurred subsequently in other countries.",

A dramatic example is afforded by the emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States, beginning in 1999 (Figure 2\n). WNV, like most arboviruses, is usually confined to a finite geographic area, based on the range of its vertebrate reservoir hosts and permissive vectors. In an unusual event, WNV was imported into New York City, probably by the introduction of infected vector mosquitoes that were inadvertent passengers on a flight from the Middle East, where the virus is enzootic. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that the genomic sequence of the New York isolates was closely related to the sequence of contemporary isolates from Israel. Some American mosquito species were competent vectors for WNV, and certain avian species such as American crows were highly susceptible. As a result, West Nile encephalitis emerged as a significant disease new to the United States. Over a period of several years WNV spread across the continent, finally reaching the west coast and many areas in Latin America.",

Arboviruses replicate in both the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector (mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies, and others), and transmission occurs when the vector takes a blood meal. Typically, arboviruses have only a few vertebrate hosts and are transmitted by a narrow range of arthropods. Humans are not the reservoir vertebrate hosts of most arboviruses, but can be infected by many of these viruses, if they happen to be bitten by an infected vector. In most instances, arbovirus-infected humans are dead-end hosts for several reasons. Many arthropod vectors competent to transmit a zoonotic arbovirus prefer nonhuman hosts as a blood source, reducing the likelihood of transmission from human to vector. Also, infected humans are usually not sufficiently permissive to experience a high titer viremia, so they cannot serve as effective links in the transmission cycle.

In retrospect, the first cases were concentrated in food handlers, who then spread the virus to the general population in that region. Although not recognized immediately as a new disease, the outbreak continued to spread both locally and in other parts of China. In February, 2003, a physician who had been treating likely SARS patients, traveled to Hong Kong, where he transmitted SARS to a large number of contacts in a hotel. These persons, in turn, spread the infection to Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Canada, initiating a global pandemic that eventually involved almost 30 countries. From patient samples, several research groups isolated a novel coronavirus, which has been named the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). Clearly, this virus is new to the human population, and there is circumstantial evidence that it was contracted from exotic food animals that are raised for sale in restaurants in Guangdong Province. Recent studies suggest that horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) may be the reservoir hosts and palm civets, consumed as food in China, may be the intermediary hosts for SARS CoV.",

Of these, the most important was the M group of HIV-1, which has been responsible for the vast majority of human infections. Furthermore, HIV-1 is most closely related to SIVcpz, the SIV strain infecting two subpopulations of chimpanzees. Different segments of the SIVcpz genome, in turn, are closely related to genome segments of two SIVs of African monkeys, red-capped monkeys and Cercopithecus monkeys. It is hypothesized that chimpanzees, which regularly kill and eat monkeys, were infected during consumption of their prey; and that a recombination event produced SIVcpz, which was derived from parts of the genomes of the two acquired monkey viruses. It is speculated that a further transmission from chimpanzees may have occurred during the butchering of nonhuman primates, which occurs in rural Africa (Figure 5\n).",

The virus infects mononuclear cells including macrophages and dendritic cells and traffics to lymph nodes, whence it spreads to target organs including the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands. It causes a high titer viremia and a dysregulation of the innate immune system. Clinically, Ebola patients undergo severe vomiting and diarrhea with massive fluid losses and become very dehydrated, with a mortality that varies from 25% to 75%. In fatal cases, the infection of the liver leads to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, a shock syndrome, and multiorgan failure, although the sequential details are not well understood. Infection is transmitted between humans by contact with bodily fluids of patients, but not by aerosols. Therefore, the virus is spread most frequently to caregivers or others who are in intimate contact with patients and their fomites. Rituals associated with funerals and burial practices often serve to transmit the virus.",

Several recent studies have shown that APOBEC3 and tetherin are two very important gate keepers for transmission of lentiviruses between different primate species (reviewed in Sharp and Hahn, 2011). APOBEC3 proteins represent a powerful first line of defense, believed to be responsible for preventing the transmission of SIVs from monkeys to chimpanzees and from monkeys to humans (Etienne et al., 2013). However, APOBEC3 proteins can be counteracted by the HIV/SIV viral infectivity factor (Vif), albeit generally in a species-specific fashion. Thus, mutations in Vif were required for monkey SIVs to be able to infect chimpanzees and then humans (Letko et al., 2013). Tetherin is a second line of defense, and only HIVs that have evolved an effective tetherin antagonism have spread widely in humans (Kluge et al., 2014). Different lentiviruses use different viral proteins to antagonize tetherin: HIV-1 group M uses the viral protein U (Vpu); HIV-2 group A uses the envelope glycoprotein (Env), and HIV-1 group O uses the negative regulatory factor (Nef). In contrast, HIV-1 groups N and P, whose spread in the human population has remained very limited, are unable to counteract tetherin efficiently.",

This underlines the role of host genetic background as a determinant of susceptibility.

Temporally, the disease should follow exposure to the putative agent; if incubation periods can be documented they may exhibit a log-normal distribution.2.If an immune response to the putative agent can be measured, this response should correlate in time with the occurrence of the disease. Subjects with evidence of immunity may be less susceptible than na\u00efve individuals.3.Experimental reproduction of the disease should occur in higher incidence in animals or humans appropriately exposed to the putative cause than in those not so exposed. Alternatively, a similar infectious agent may cause an analogous disease in experimental animals.4.Elimination or modification of the putative cause should decrease the incidence of the disease.
