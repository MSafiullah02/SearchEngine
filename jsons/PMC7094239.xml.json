Whilst the primary physiological role of ACE in the RAS is to hydrolyse angiotensin I (Ang I) to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang II) [1], ACE2 is able to cleave Ang II to produce Ang (1\u20137), a peptide which has opposing effects [2], [3]. The physiological significance of ACE2 in the RAS has been demonstrated in a variety of tissues including the heart, liver, kidney and lung [4], [5], [6], [7]. In addition, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for the SARS coronavirus, the causative agent of severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [8]. ACE2, like ACE, is a type I transmembrane metallopeptidase with an extracellular ectodomain containing its zinc-coordinating catalytic site [9], [10]. Here, it is positioned to hydrolyse circulating substrates and serve as a viral receptor. Regulation of its expression at the cell surface is therefore of prime importance to its physiological and pathophysiological functions.",

The function of diverse cell surface proteins is regulated by such shedding events, including enzymes (ACE, beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme), cytokines and growth factors (TNF-\u03b1, heparin binding epithelial growth factor) and neurodegenerative proteins (amyloid precursor protein, cellular prion protein) [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Whilst a great deal is known about the proteases which mediate these shedding events, the factors regulating this process still remain unclear. Ectodomain shedding is a complex event responding to a variety of stimuli (phorbol esters, calcium ionophores, growth factors) and involving a variety of interacting cellular proteins (protein kinase C, Eve), depending on the substrate [19], [20], [21].",

            "text": "In this study, we have identified the involvement of calmodulin in the regulation of ACE2 ectodomain shedding. Calmodulin is an ubiquitous calcium binding protein which is known to bind other transmembrane proteins, including l-selectin and ACE, and regulate their cell surface expression [22], [23]. Here, we show that calmodulin interacts with ACE2, both in cells expressing ACE2 heterologously and endogenously, and inhibitors of calmodulin increase the release of the ACE2 ectodomain in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This stimulation of shedding is only partially abrogated by metalloproteinase inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of disparate sheddases. Furthermore, treatment with calmodulin inhibitors decreases the association between the two proteins, suggesting the interaction of ACE2 with calmodulin serves to retain catalytically active enzyme in the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "ACE2 is increasingly recognised to have a pivotal role in regulating the local levels of the hypertensive and mitogenic peptide angiotensin II [25], [26], [27]. In addition, it is also the cellular receptor of the causative agent of SARS, SARS-CoV [8]. ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein which is subject to a juxtamembrane cleavage event releasing a catalytically active ectodomain [12]. While the precise physiological role of this \u2018shedding\u2019 event is unknown it is clear, given the well documented pathophysiological roles of Ang II, that the mechanisms regulating the cell surface expression of ACE2 are of critical importance. We have previously demonstrated that the shedding of ACE2 can be stimulated by phorbol ester, a process mediated at least in part by the promiscuous metalloproteinase \u2018sheddase\u2019, ADAM 17 [12]. Here, we show that the shedding of ACE2 can also be upregulated by inhibitors of the ubiquitous calcium binding protein, calmodulin, both in cells endogenously expressing ACE2 (Huh7) and in those heterologously over-expressing it (HEK-ACE2). The CaMi-mediated increase in ACE2 shedding was reduced by the hydroxamate-derived metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001, suggesting the involvement of an ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase). Inhibitors of other classes of proteinases (serine, aspartic, and cysteine) had no effect on cleavage. Further studies are required to determine whether the CaMi-stimulated shedding of ACE2 is also mediated by ADAM17, or whether phorbol esters and calmodulin inhibitors invoke distinct sheddases.",

While further studies are required to elucidate the precise binding site of calmodulin on ACE2, these results clearly indicate that association of calmodulin with ACE2 has a regulatory role in its cleavage-secretion from the plasma membrane. It is noteworthy that the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 is quite distinct to that of ACE, the shedding of which is also modulated by association with calmodulin [23]; however, the ACE2 tail bears significant sequence identity to collectrin, a developmentally regulated protein recently shown to have a critical role in amino acid retrieval in the kidney [28], [29] (Fig. 4\n). Analysis of the sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of collectrin also identifies a putative calmodulin-binding motif (Fig. 4). Recent studies have revealed that collectrin is also subject to ectodomain shedding [30], suggesting a possible role for calmodulin in regulating the cell surface expression and release of this protein.",
