Incidence is the number of new infections arising per unit time, and is usually expressed at x% per year or x cases per 1000 per year or x cases per 100 000 per year. Prevalence is the proportion of the population (usually expressed as a percentage) that is infected at a point in time and is measured by cross-sectional surveys. Incidence can be measured directly in longitudinal cohort studies, where a group of subjects is followed through time, or can be calculated from a series of cross-sectional prevalence surveys.18 Case notifications are often used as a proxy measure for incidence; long-term datasets are available for a large number of infectious agents due to mandatory (notifiable) disease surveillance schemes in developed countries. Historical datasets containing valuable information on causes of death and age, in some cases going back for hundreds of years, are also available. These datasets are rather subjective but have been useful in examining epidemics such as the Black Death (plague) and smallpox.",

Eventually, the fall in incidence leads to a fall in prevalence because infections are \u2018lost\u2019 from the population (due to recovery, death or emigration) faster than they are replaced by the spreading of infection. In the longer term, the infectious agent may be able to persist in the population (i.e. become endemic) if there is a high enough rate of resupply of susceptible individuals due to birth, immigration, recovery from infection (if there is no lasting immunity) or waning of immunity (if applicable); otherwise the infectious agent will go extinct locally.",

(Note that \u2018(t)\u2019 indicates that the value can change with time \u2013 see below.) A related quantity is the basic reproduction number R\n0, which is defined as the mean number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a population of wholly susceptible individuals, i.e. the basic reproduction number is what the value of the reproduction number would be if the population were totally susceptible. It is important to understand that the reproduction number is specific to the particular infectious agent in the particular population at the particular time, and can be changed by interventions. The value of the reproduction number depends upon the average rate of transmission from an infectious individual and the average duration of infectiousness. An epidemic requires that R(t) be greater than 1, so that the prevalence of infection increases because more than one new infection arises from the average infected person before that person is \u2018lost\u2019 from the infected population. In the typical epidemic described above, depletion of the \u2018supply\u2019 of susceptible individuals causes R(t) to fall, even though R\n0 was not changing. In fact, R(t) falls even as incidence rises; the increase in incidence is driven by the increase in prevalence, which initially \u2018overcomes\u2019 the effect of R(t) falling.",

The higher the value of R\n0, the harder an infection will be to control. In a homogeneous population (one where everyone has the same average risk of acquiring and transmitting infection) the relationship between R\n0 and R(t) is R(t) = R\n0 \u00d7 s where s is the proportion of the population that is susceptible. To prevent an epidemic by vaccination requires that s be reduced so that R(t) <1 (i.e. that s be reduced below 1/R\n0), thus the greater the value of R\n0 the smaller s must be. The critical vaccination threshold is the proportion of the population that must be successfully immunized to prevent an epidemic; for childhood infections such as measles which have high typical R\n0 values this is typically >90% or even >95%.",

Important characteristics of the natural history of an infection are the incubation period (the time from the point of infection until the appearance of symptoms) and the latent period (the time from infection to becoming infectious). These periods vary greatly (from days to years, depending upon the infection) and either can be longer than the other. For HIV and influenza the latent period is shorter than the incubation period, with people becoming infectious before they become unwell, but for pulmonary TB they can be the same, with people becoming infectious at the time they become unwell.",

The number of reported cases in the epidemic with time were used to estimate the initial growth rate (r, the rate of exponential increase in new cases at the start of an epidemic) which is related to the basic reproduction number (R\n0) and the generation time (Tg, the mean period of time from a host becoming infected to infecting another individual) by the equation R0 = rTg + 1. Using data from the initial period (before control measures were introduced) of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong the epidemic growth rate was shown to be approximately 0.15 cases per day31 which, when used in the above equation with Tg = 10, gives an R\n0 value of 2.5, an estimate close to that made by analyses of data from Singapore by Lipsitch et al.32 of between 2.2 and 3.6 days. Wallinga & Teunis33 analyzed incidence data from four countries before and after the WHO global alert and subsequent control measures of March 2003.

This is one of the reasons that respiratory distress is such a common cause of death. The relative lack of these receptors in the upper respiratory epithelium causes much lower titers of virus to grow in nasal mucosa; hence, the virus is more pathogenic but much less transmissible by infected humans. In order to maintain its pathogenicity, the virus would need to maintain its tropism for the lower respiratory epithelial sialic acid receptor linkage and to acquire the ability to simultaneously bind to sialic acid linkages present in upper respiratory epithelium. It is quite possible (indeed likely) that the virus would have to compromise and be less pathogenic if it becomes more transmissible. Thus, a more highly transmissible H5N1 might be less transmissible than SARS and currently circulating strains of influenza A and less pathogenic than the strains that have to date been acquired directly from birds.",

As noted above, models can be used to help set research priorities by determining which gaps in knowledge are most important epidemiologically. Increases in computing power make it possible to develop increasingly sophisticated simulation models and to use them in real-time to analyze outbreaks to determine whether interventions are working and to guide policymakers in their response. DNA fingerprinting techniques are being used to identify clusters of transmission between individuals42,\n43 and there is currently a lot of interest in synthesizing analysis of evolution and transmission dynamics, termed \u2018phylodynamics\u2019.44 Another area of research is in characterizing contact patterns between individuals in more detail45 since this has important consequences for patterns of transmission. Finally, the use of modeling in planning and evaluating clinical trials has been advocated.46\n",
