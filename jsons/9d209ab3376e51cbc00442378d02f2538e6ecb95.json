            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder due to a range of mutations in the CF gene affecting the cAMP-regulated chloride channel (CF transmembrane regulator or CFTR). In the lungs, this leads to dehydration of the peri-ciliary layer such that the mucociliary escalator cannot perform its function of clearing particles (including microorganisms) from the airways. Patients develop acute and later chronic respiratory infection leading to a cycle of further damage and less ability to clear infection. The range of micro-organisms causing infection differs from those in patients without CF with the commonest pathogens being Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 1, 2 Antibiotics are used to clear early infection, treat acute exacerbations of chronic infection and reduce the frequency of exacerbations (by use of long-term systemic or inhaled drugs). These treatments have had a major impact on the quality and survival of patients with CF. There are still however questions about the best way to diagnose infection and the use of antibiotics in patients who will need repeated courses during their lifetime. Bacteria in chronic infection have different characteristics from those causing acute infection, including atypical phenotypes leading to difficulty in identifying some species in the laboratory. Antibiotic resistance-both from infection with innately resistant bacteria and also the development of multi-resistant strainsis an increasing challenge to CF. Although infection remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality, 3 recent advances in understanding the role of different species and modes of pathogenicity hold much promise for improved treatments.",

Specific antibiotic treatment strategies or practical guidelines for the diagnosis of infection will not be discussed here but are well reviewed elsewhere. 4, 5 Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequent pathogen in young infants with CF, but an uncommon cause of lower respiratory tract infection in patients without CF. It has been found in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in 30% of CF children of average age of 3 months 6 and often persists despite treatment. 7 The use of anti-staphylococcal antibiotics has been clinically effective but the role of long-term prophylaxis for S. aureus is uncertain. 8 The small-colony variant (SCV) phenotype of S. aureus is common in CF patients. 7 These bacteria have adaptations including antibiotic resistance and the ability to survive inside host cells, which may contribute to persistence in the CF airways. The colonies are very small, non-pigmented and are slow growing, so may be missed during routine culture, but the use of certain media may make them easier to recognize. The slow growth makes identification and susceptibility testing in automated systems unreliable.",

Hypermutator bacteria have mutations in DNA repair or error avoidance genes such that the spontaneous mutation rate is raised. Mutator strains of S. aureus have been identified in CF, some due to inactivation of a DNA mismatch repair gene mutS. 10 Another mechanism that may help the long-term survival of S. aureus in the CF lung is the ability to form biofilms. This may be important for infection of medical devices and prostheses such as artificial heart valves and orthopaedic implants. The role of biofilms in CF is however unclear and needs further investigation.",

Major attempts are being made to control the spread of resistant S. aureus, 11 with some success in the UK. However, the prevalence of MRSA in CF patients is increasing 12 and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, although very rare, are being seen in non-CF patients.

Resistance included decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, which is rarely seen outside CF. One-third of patients had hypermutable strains.

Eventually, chronic infection develops and this leads to a faster decline in lung function. The age at which infection becomes chronic has increased with better treatment of CF. This is particularly due to the practice of intense treatment with antipseudomonal antibiotics when P. aeruginosa is first cultured, which can delay the onset of chronic infection and increase life expectancy in CF. The patient may be clinically stable when chronically infected with P. aeruginosa but has repeated episodes of acute exacerbation with increased breathlessness, sputum production and feeling unwell. These exacerbations are also marked by a reduction in lung function. Exacerbations are generally treated with a combination of systemic antibiotics. 5 Inhaled antibiotics, most commonly colistin or tobramycin, can be used to help clear early infection. They can be effective as long-term prophylaxis, reducing frequency of acute exacerbation once infection is chronic. More recently, long-term azithromycin prophylaxis has been used in CF. This followed experience with treating diffuse pan-bronchiolitis, a condition described in Japan that also leads to chronic infection with P. aeruginosa. The benefit of long-term oral azithromycin has been shown in CF, 19 with fewer exacerbations, better lung function and a reduction in inflammatory markers. Macrolide antibiotics may act because of their anti-inflammatory activity or by modifying the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa (see below).",

            "text": "Early epidemiological studies showed that cross-infection with P. aeruginosa was rare and that CF patients were infected with their own unique strains presumably acquired from the environment. Some siblings did have the same strain but it was unclear if this was due to cross-infection or acquisition from a common source. In contrast, more recent studies revealed the spread of the so-called epidemic strains, some of which were multi-resistant. This would not necessarily be a particular concern except that some, for example, the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES), may be more pathogenic and can superinfect patients already colonized with other strains of P. aeruginosa. Infected patients had more exacerbations, time in hospital and courses of antibiotics. 20 Furthermore, when patients were first infected with multiresistant epidemic P. aeruginosa early aggressive treatment often failed. 21 This led to a policy in the UK of segregating patients with epidemic strains. The LES genome was recently sequenced and work is progressing to determine the basis of transmissibility and enhanced pathogenicity. Most strains of LES are hyper-producers of pyocyanin. This is a putative pathogenicity factor with effects including reduced beating of respiratory epithelium cilia and induction neutrophil apoptosis, and is regulated by quorum sensing (QS) (lasA). 22 QS systems have been extensively studied in P. aeruginosa. Molecular signals allow communication between bacteria. 23 They are secreted and at a certain concentration can trigger expression of genes. In P. aeruginosa, these include those that code for pathogenicity factors, biofilm formation and motility. It is thought that 5% of genes in P. aeruginosa are regulated by QS and this mechanism allows precise regulation of genes in response to environmental stimuli and cell density. Some plants naturally form antagonists to QS molecules (acylated homoserine lactones) as a defence mechanism. QS is therefore a potential target for new antimicrobial therapies.",

            "text": "In the laboratory, bacteria isolated from chronically infected patients differ from the usual P. aeruginosa cultured from acute infection. Clonal bacteria can form colonies with different appearance referred to as colonial morphotypes. The classical CF isolate is mucoid, due to hyperproduction of alginate. Other morphotypes include bacteria that look like coliforms, non-pigmented forms and slow-growing SCVs. 24 These latter are hydrophobic, have reduced swimming motility and form good biofilms in vitro. They may be missed in the routine laboratory because they can take more than 48 h to appear. Phenotypic variation is not restricted to colonial morphology but includes type III secretion, auxotrophy, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) modification (smooth to rough) and both resistance and hypersusceptibility to antibiotics. Variability in antibiotic susceptibility in a population of bacteria from a CF sputum includes differences between bacteria of the same clone and morphotype. As a result, susceptibility testing is poorly reproducible as the result may depend on which bacteria are picked for testing. 25 The role of antimicrobial susceptibility testing for helping the clinician who chose the antibiotics to treat acute exacerbations in CF is controversial. There are anecdotal reports of poor correlation between antimicrobial susceptibility and treatment of acute exacerbation. Methods to improve the detection of resistant sub-populations have been described. 25, 26 However, the only big study to correlate antibiotic resistance to clinical response showed that lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second) improved in patients in spite of treatment with antibiotics to which their P. aeruginosa were resistant in vitro. 27 Antibiotics seldom if ever eradicate chronic infection with P. aeruginosa from the CF lung. Even the resolution of symptoms and signs of an exacerbation may not be matched with a significant reduction in bacterial load. It may be therefore that antibiotics are effective without actually inhibiting or killing the bacteria-the so-called sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) effect. This may also explain the successful treatment of infection with antibiotics, even though the bacteria are resistant. For example, at sub-MIC concentration, ceftazidime can inhibit attachment to cells and ciprofloxacin can reduce alginate production. 28 Although P. aeruginosa is intrinsically resistant, azithromycin may reduce pathogenicity by inhibition of QS and biofilm formation.",

Different results can however be obtained with different methods and there is no accepted reference standard. 30 There are few studies that attempt to correlate the results of synergy testing with the clinical outcome. One randomized prospective study compared the MCBT with traditional single antibiotic susceptibility testing for determining treatment of acute exacerbation with a range of multi-resistant species in CF including P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). This showed no better outcome when antibiotics were chosen on the basis of the result of MCBT. 31 The role of current methods of synergy testing is controversial, but there is a definite need for clinically validated in vitro tests to guide treatment of multi-and pan-resistant bacteria at acute exacerbation and when patients receive lung transplants.",

These bacteria have defects in their ability to correct mistakes in DNA replication because of a range of mutations, including in the mismatch repair genes such as mutS. Strong mutators may have a mutation rate as high as 1\u00c2 10 25 to 10 24 , compared with the normal rates of 1\u00c2 10 28 to 10 27 . One study showed hypermutators in 37% of CF patients with chronic infection with P. aeruginosa. 32 This was the highest prevalence described in a natural system. Since then hypermutators have been shown in other chronic lung diseases. 33 Hypermutator strains were found amongst isolates of P. aeruginosa early in infection suggesting that they may have an advantage in initiating infection as well as in chronic infection, however they were infrequent. 34 It was questioned whether mutator strains would be at a disadvantage because of the high rate of damaging spontaneous mutations. However, their ability to rapidly adapt to a changing environment becomes an advantage in an ecological niche repeatedly exposed to antibiotics. In the large population of bacteria in the CF lung, an organism with a mutation for antibiotic resistance may be present even before the antibiotic is given. It has been practice in CF to give two anti-pseudomonal antibiotics to reduce the emergence of resistant strains. The recent observation of hypermutators in CF shows the potential importance of that recommendation.",

            "text": "In common with other bacteria seen in CF, some P. aeruginosa form biofilms in vitro and can be observed in biofilm-like aggregates in expectorated sputum. Biofilms are communities of bacteria within an acellular matrix, usually attached to a surface-in CF, the respiratory epithelium. In the patient, biofilms may also contain other species of bacteria and host-derived products. Bacteria in biofilms are difficult to eradicate as they can resist the host immune system and are more antibiotic resistant by a variety of mechanisms. Antibiotics may bind to the extracellular matrix or have reduced activity in areas of poor oxygenation or low pH. Also the bacteria in a biofilm live in a gradient of oxygen, nutrients and metabolites. They are therefore diverse, having adapted to the different micro-environments. The growth phase (actively dividing or dormant) may affect their susceptibility to some antibiotics. 35 The variability in antibiotic susceptibility seen in the population of bacteria cultured from a single sputum under the same in vitro conditions may be because bacteria are present in biofilm fragments in the sputum. These organisms may have adapted to a range of different active concentrations of antibiotic encountered in different levels of the biofilm. Concern that laboratory methods developed to measure the antibiotic susceptibility of planktonic bacteria causing acute infections may not be relevant to CF has led to development of methods to test antibiotic susceptibility in a biofilm. Evaluation of one method to determine the optimum antibiotics to clear chronic infection is in progress. 36 A recent study using whole genome analysis showed an accumulation of mutations in 68 genes of P. aeruginosa over 8 years in a patient with CF. 37 This evolutionary divergence was thought to favour adaptation. Early and late isolates of P. aeruginosa from 29 patients were compared to look at these genes. One of the commonest mutations was in las R, the principle QS regulator in P. aeruginosa. This interferes with many pathogenicity factors including biofilm formation. This is difficult to reconcile with the proposed importance of biofilms in persistence of infection. Other genes commonly mutated after chronic colonization are also involved in pathogenicity e.g. exo A, the regulator of type III secretion and antibiotic resistance (genes coding for components of multi-drug efflux pumps). The picture that may be emerging is therefore of an organism with a great ability to adapt to its environment that becomes less pathogenic with time, presumably in itself a device for long-term survival in its host. A recent study has shown that antibiotic-resistant genes are not over-represented in hypermutators and that hypermutability may play an important more general role in genome evolution and adaptation in the CF lung. 38 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia spp. (see below) in CF have a range of strategies to enable them to persist in the CF lung, including constantly adapting to a changing environment. 3 Not only are these bacteria difficult to eradicate, but also the phenotypic diversity observed in the laboratory makes the design and validation of new tests of antibiotic susceptibility very difficult. Future research is needed to understand the mechanisms of pathogenicity and persistence, treatment to prevent or clear infection and the development of appropriate laboratory test of susceptibility relevant to clinical outcome.",

Presently, the so-called Bcc comprises at least 15 species. 40 They are natural soil bacteria, found in the rhizosphere and can be plant symbionts or pathogens. While they can be opportunist pathogens affecting patients who are severely immuno-suppressed or following contamination of fluids or medical devices, they only cause significant primary infection in patients with CF or chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). While patients with CGD have a specific immune defect in the oxidative burst pathway, the reason for the association with CF is still unknown. Patients with non-CF bronchiectasis do not get infected with Bcc. These are complex organisms with a range of pathogenicity factors, many regulated by QS systems, similar to P. aeruginosa. 41 Burkholderia spp. are resistant to colistin and often multi-or even panresistant. Some combinations of antibiotics are effective in vitro but there is little evidence to correlate the results with the clinical response to treatment. 31 The importance of Bcc in CF was first recognized following outbreaks in the 1980s. 42 By the 1990s, the ET12 strain of Burkholderia cenocepacia was the most common in the UK and Canada. This was highly transmissible and pathogenic and led to many deaths due to a rapidly progressing pneumonia sometimes with bacteraemia, referred to as the 'cepacia syndrome'. Bcc survives well in natural and healthcare environments and some strains most notably the ET12 lineage of B. cenocepacia easily spread between patients. Controls to reduce cross-infection including segregating patients have been the main reason that infection and mortality has declined significantly. In the UK, the most common species seen is Burkholderia multivorans and most new infections are caused by unrelated clones, suggesting an environmental source rather than person-to-person spread. Infection with Bcc is more common in older CF patients but can occur at any time in the patient's life. Cepacia syndrome can occur when the organism is first acquired or unexpectedly many years after initial infection. It is most frequently due to B. cenocepacia; however, both B. multivorans and Burkholderia dolosa can also cause the 'cepacia syndrome'. 43 Of the potential pathogenicity factors (LPS, specific cytotoxins and the ability to form biofilms) many are controlled by QS. In addition, Bcc are able to survive in cultured human epithelial cells and macrophages. Severity of disease may be strain rather than species-specific; however, it may also be dependent on patient factors and interactions with other pathogens. Of note, neither the presence of cable pili nor the presence of B. cepacia epidemic strain marker is now considered as a reliable indicator of virulence or transmissibility. 42 Chronic infection may develop with acute exacerbations and a gradual decline in lung function. While transmissible species can replace other Burkholderia spp. causing chronic infection, exacerbations are not associated with acquisition of a new species or strain. 44 Factors that lead to more severe disease with certain species or strains are still unclear. The relevance of other members of the complex is unclear. Prompt and accurate laboratory identification of Bcc is very important because of the implications for the patient's care and the need to prevent cross-infection. Commercial identification systems are not reliable but the use of selective culture media and molecular identification methods have greatly improved detection.",

It is important however that they are correctly identified. This is so that any association with significant disease may be recognized but also because some may be mistaken for known pathogens. UK reference laboratory reports suggest that around 10% bacteria referred as members of the Bcc were initially mis-identified.

Automated liquid systems allow more rapid culture of NTM and may be more sensitive than the traditional use of Lowenstein Jensen agar slopes. The high number of P. aeruginosa in CF sputum can however cause problems with decontamination and make NTM culture difficult. 51 NTM are ubiquitous in the environment and can be found in dust, food and drinking water. CF patients are therefore repeatedly exposed to NTM and it is not surprising that their sputum can be infected. Infection in CF is restricted to the lungs without the disseminated NTM disease found in patients with AIDS. In a study of 21 USA CF centres, 128 (13%) of 986 CF patients over 10 years old had NTM cultured from at least one of three sputa over 12 months. 52 Of these 25 (2.5%) met the ATS criteria for NTM disease, although the relevance of these criteria for patients with CF has not been assessed. Infection with NTM was more common in older patients and was associated with better lung function and co-infection with S. aureus rather than P. aeruginosa. There appears to be a geographical influence on the overall prevalence; this ranged from 24% in New Orleans to 7% in Boston. It is uncertain however whether these differences relate to different climate or vegetation or reflect the antibiotic and steroid usage in those CF clinics. Members of the Mycobacterium avium complex were most frequently isolated (72% of patients), with M. avium, the predominant species. Almost all patients had unique strains with no evidence of cross-infection and 10% had mixed species. Mycobacterium abscessus only accounted for 16% of NTM cultured in the US study but has been increasingly reported in CF patients in Europe. 53 This seems to be associated with a more severe infection, and research on pathogenicity is needed. M. abscessus colonies can either be rough or smooth depending on the expression of glycopeptidolipid (GPL). It has been proposed that the smooth form (with GPL) forms biofilms in vitro and is less pathogenic-favouring colonization whereas the rough form produces little GPL, infects human monocytes and causes persistent invasive infection in a mouse model. 54, 55 A similar relationship between colonial morphology and virulence has been proposed for M. avium and M. kansasii. There have however been no studies to test the clinical relevance of these observations. In common with other bacteria that may persist in biofilms, M. abscessus appears less susceptible to antibiotics when grown in biofilms than in planktonic cultures. 56 The clinical relevance of NTM can be difficult to assess in CF as these patients usually have other pathogens in their sputum. In addition, NTM of different species may be cultured on different occasions such that it can be difficult to distinguish repeated acquisition and loss from the environment from established infection. All isolates therefore need to be identified rather than assuming that repeat positive cultures of Mycobacterium spp. indicate persistent infection. Difficulties with identification and changes in taxonomy mean that previous infection attributed to M. fortuitum complex or with M. chelonae may have been due to M. abscessus.",

Aspergillomas have also been seen in CF but are rare. A recent paper has described a bronchitis in six patients with infection with Aspergillus without the features of ABPA who responded to antifungal therapy. 59 Scedosporium apiospermum has also been associated with the ABPA-like picture in CF. 60 Candida spp. are commonly cultured from CF sputum. This is not unexpected given that much antibiotic treatment in CF is broad spectrum and can lead to an overgrowth of Candida spp. on mucosal surfaces. Some cultures are therefore due to oral contamination of sputum but colonization of sputum is also possible.

These were thought to be due to contamination with saliva, however these bacteria may be present in such large numbers that it is more likely that sputum was seeded during small-volume aspiration and multiplication takes place in the sputum. 61 Two main lines of investigation have focused on these bacteria. Careful culture techniques have shown the large number and diversity of anaerobes that can be cultured from CF sputum. 62 The use of 16s rRNA gene profiling by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms directly from CF sputum has shown a great diversity of anaerobic and aerobic species. 63 What is the significance of these observations? It may be that these flora are just bystanders (commensals). Alternately, some may actually be pathogenic and have been missed because they are present in a mixture with an assumed pathogen such as P. aeruginosa. This could even explain why CF patients may improve when treated with antibiotics to which the conventional pathogen is resistant in vitro. 27 Another explanation is that members of the 'normal' flora may interact with the conventional pathogen. In one study, a viridantype Streptococcus was shown to enhance the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa in an agar bead lung infection model in rats. 61 This viridans-type Streptococcus and a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, both isolated from CF sputum, also upregulated P. aeruginosa genes. These included those coding for pathogenicity factors such as elastase (lasB).",

Respiratory viruses are thought to be a trigger or co-factor in acute infective exacerbations of COPD 65 and it has been proposed that they may play a role in developing chronic infection with bacterial pathogens. Early Danish data showed that CF patients were more likely to acquire their first P. aeruginosa or develop chronic pseudomonal infection between October and March-the peak season for respiratory viruses. This finding was consistent over 25 years in spite of major changes in treatment of bacterial infection. The rapid technical advances, for examples, with the use of micro-arrays, should allow more in-depth studies of the role of viral infections in CF. 66 Influenza A can have a significant impact in patients with CF. Anti-viral drugs are recommended in the UK for patients with chronic lung disease including CF, both for treatment and prevention after exposure. Annual vaccination is also recommended for patients with CF.",
