Enterotoxigenic K99+\nEscherichia coli (K99) and Salmonella strains, bovine rotavirus (BRV) and coronavirus (BCV) and the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum are commonly reported endemic microorganisms associated with neonatal calf diarrhoea (Lanz Uhde et al, 2008, Bartels et al, 2010, Izzo et al, 2011). Whereas K99 causes diarrhoea only during the first week of life, BRV, BCV, C. parvum and Salmonella also affect older calves (Bazeley, 2003, Foster, Smith, 2009, Gulliksen et al, 2009, Izzo et al, 2011).",

Some authors have suggested that the severity of the diarrhoea increases in the presence of co-infections (De la Fuente et al., 1999; Garc\u0131a et al., 2000), and environmental and husbandry practices, such as inadequate colostrum intake, housing types, and poor hygiene, have also been considered risk factors for calf diarrhoea (Waltner-Toews et al, 1986a, Quigley et al, 1995, Bazeley, 2003). Therefore, due to its multifactorial nature, studies of risk factors for neonatal calf diarrhoea should ideally be performed using comprehensive laboratory investigations and multivariable analyses, but data from such studies are scant.",

This minimum farm-size allowed the sampling of multiple calves of the selected ages on each farm, on a single sampling occasion. The sampling frame was represented by all the farms milking >150 cows registered in a database, which included ~10,600 farms milking >150 cows, corresponding to approximately 90% of the estimated number of dairy farms in the country.\n2\n",

These were firstly the risk factors for neonatal calf diarrhoea. The probability of passing liquid faeces at the day of sampling was in theory correlated to the incidence of diarrhoea on the farm, and the duration of the diarrhoea. Thus, this study analysed the presence of variables independently associated with liquid faeces, using the binary outcome: presence/absence of faecal score 3. The second question considered risk factors for enteropathogen shedding, in which we analysed the presence of variables independently associated with the presence of each enteropathogen in faeces using binary outcomes: presence/absence of each enteropathogen (separate univariate models were fitted for each enteropathogen).",

LogReg was performed by backward variable elimination. Each model was repeated using 50 imputed datasets and the 50 estimates pooled as previously described (van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). The process progressed by elimination of variables with the highest P-value, re-introduction of the previously eliminated variable and selection of the model with the smallest Akaike Information Criterion score (M\u00fcller et al., 2013). Analyses concluded when only variables with P < 0.05 remained.",

In 9 to 21-day-old calves, dam vaccination against enteropathogens was associated with decreased odds of liquid faeces, in agreement with the experimental evidence (Gonzalez et al., 2010). Dam vaccination is usually implemented during late pregnancy to increase specific colostral immunoglobulin content. In some studies, vaccinating farms were more likely to manifest diarrhoea than non-vaccinating farms (Waltner-Toews et al, 1986a, Frank, Kaneene, 1993, Bendali et al, 1999). However, the effect of vaccination depends, among other reasons, on the type of circulating agents.

Exposure to winter weather might predispose calves to indigestion and diarrhoea, and provision of shelter could improve calf health. In this age-group, calves on farms reporting colostrum administration within the first 2 h of a calf's life had smaller odds of liquid faeces compared with calves on farms reporting administration within 6 h. Administering first colostrum was also associated with decreased odds of liquid faeces compared with stored or mixed colostrum. These factors might have been acted independently, or through the presence of undetected infectious agents (e.g. calves sampled in pre- or post-patent periods). Nevertheless, delaying colostrum intake is known to decrease intestinal immunoglobulin and fat-soluble vitamin absorption (Bellinzoni et al, 1989, Fayer et al, 2000, Bazeley, 2003), and the results highlight the importance of administering first colostrum as soon as possible after birth.",

Whereas male calves might have little economic value, the value of replacement females is high, potentially influencing neonatal care. In some systems, the rates of dystocia are greater in males, which might affect passive immunoglobulin transfer due to reduced calf vigour and delayed colostrum ingestion (Bellows et al, 1982, Johanson, Berger, 2003). The use of straw was also associated with decreased odds of liquid faeces compared to sawdust in this age group. This is consistent with other reports suggesting straw as an optimal bedding material (Brenner et al, 2005, Stull, Reynolds, 2008, Mohler et al, 2009). Furthermore, ingested sawdust might disturb gastrointestinal function.",
