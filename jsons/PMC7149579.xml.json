            "text": "The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) classified poultry production system into four sectors based on the level of biosecurity and marketing of birds and their products (FAO, 2004). Apart from commercial poultry maintained in integrated farming systems with moderate to high levels of biosecurity (sector 1\u20133), there is a \u201cbackyard\u201d or \u201cvillage level\u201d poultry sector with minimal biosecurity (sector 4). In this backyard sector, native birds or locally available breeds are maintained, and the birds or their products are mostly consumed locally. The concept of backyard farming is as old as civilization. Many families in the villages of the rural world keep a small chicken flock of various ages. The majority of these birds are kept in free-range systems, in which the birds scavenge around the house or in the backyard during daytime. The term backyard farming is originated from it. A primitive type of poultry house is offered to the birds during night. The feed consists of household wastes or kitchen scraps like raw vegetables, cooked rice, insects, larvae, seeds, and so on (Samanta et al., 2016).",

It is an important component of small farmers\u2019 livelihoods and a tool for poverty alleviation (Sambo et al., 2015).

Sometimes the products are consumed by the owners or used as gifts to the friends and relatives during festival and as sacrificial offer to traditional deity (Hamilton-West et al., 2012). In Bhutan, backyard products also act as a source of protein for the female members of the household during pregnancy and postparturition period (Tashi and Dorji, 2014). Backyard chicken eggs are popular among urban and educated consumers due to their higher nutritional quality. These eggs contain higher concentration of vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and \u03b2-carotene (Long and Alterman, 2007). The backyard farming reduces environmental pollution by the conversion of kitchen scraps into proteins (meat and eggs), and the use of chicken manure as garden fertilizer. Moreover, production of meats and eggs locally reduces the transport of the items from distant places and thus reduces carbon emission (Fukumoto, 2009).",

This rearing system is known as \u201chobby/peridomestic/fancy poultry\u201d or \u201curban backyard farming.\u201d In urban backyard farming, the birds are primarily kept for a homemade source of food, for fun, or as a hobby or companion pet to improve psychological health of the owners. This last purpose is usually a family tradition, exposing children to the food production process and general affection for birds, and functioning as insect control (USDA, 2004). This kind of farming is not associated with economical benefit because their rearing costs are often higher than the production (Pollock et al., 2012). In urban United States, keeping backyard poultry flocks have been steadily increasing in popularity. The study in the United States detected that 31.5% of urban and 30.1% of suburban residents prefer to keep backyard poultry (Elkhorabi et al., 2014). Even a number of cities in the United States, such as Columbia, Missouri, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Denver, Colorado, and Auburn, Alabama have passed regulations allowing chickens to be kept at residences (Bartling, 2010). The trend of keeping urban backyard poultry is also detected in the greater London area in the United Kingdom (Karabozhilova et al., 2012), Canada (Burns et al., 2011), and New Zealand (Lockhart et al., 2010). In British Columbia (Canada), an authorized person may keep up to 400 egg-producing hens and may produce up to 3000 kg of chicken meat per year (British Columbia Farm Review Board, 2009).",

In India, the majority of families (44%\u201367%) in West Bengal, Tripura, and Assam practiced backyard poultry production (NSSO, 2006). In Pakistan, after textiles, the poultry industry is the biggest commercial sector in the country and it contributes considerably to the national economy. Pakistan also maintains a large backyard poultry sector and it is observed that every rural family and every fifth urban family breed poultry at home (Sadiq, 2004).",

This contribution is considerably low for a rural livelihood, but it can be increased by expanding the egg production level. The major constraint in increasing the egg production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity practices followed by the farmers (Conan et al., 2012).

Ducks are the second predominant species after chicken kept by backyard farming in Southeast Asian countries (e.g., Thailand). In Thailand, ducks are raised on rice fields after the harvest to feed on leftover rice grains. The ducks are moved by truck or other vehicle from one rice field to another during the postharvest season (5\u20136 months out of the year) (Gilbert et al., 2007). The ducks are also reared on ponds or channels with or without fish/pig farming on the same site. Rearing pigs in an enclosure within the backyard farm was also observed in New Zealand (Zheng et al., 2010). In some countries (e.g., India), fighting cocks are reared for income generation in places where cock fighting is a traditional recreation among villagers. Cockerels (male chickens less than 1 year of age) are reared for cultural and religious purposes in some places (FAO, 2008a). A small number of people (e.g., 3% of studied population in Chile and some people of Thailand) prefer to keep wild birds, such as austral thrush (Turdus falcklandii), shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis), austral blackbird (Curaeus curaeus) and common diuca finch (Diuca diuca), and ostrich (Struthio camelus) as backyard pets (Gilbert et al., 2007, Hamilton-West et al., 2012).",

The better egg production (150 eggs per bird/annum) of RIR chicken than the native breeds (80\u201390 eggs/bird/annum) was observed in West Bengal (India) when the birds were provided with supplemented feed along with scavenging (Das et al., 2014). In Ethiopia, RIR breeds of chicken showed poor tolerance to the local climate. Moreover, supply of RIR hen\u2019s eggs, pullets, and cocks in the localities reduced the brooding capacity of the native breeds and their adaptation to the local feeding system (Dinka et al., 2010). Moreover, a synthetic breed (Kuroiler) developed by a private organization was introduced in India for backyard rearing. Kuroiler is a dual type bird having higher production capacity than the indigenous (desi) chickens with some features of native birds, such as feather color and alertness (Fig. 14.3\n) (Ahuja et al., 2008).",

In Chile, the birds are kept in three types of systems\u2014namely, permanent confinement, free-range, and a mixed confinement. In mixed confinement, the birds scavenge freely in the courtyard of the farmer\u2019s house during daytime, and at night they are kept in an indigenous pen. Among these three systems, the mixed confinement is the most common one (Hamilton-West et al., 2012). The indigenous pens are mostly made of bamboo with or without an asbestos shade in Asian countries (Samanta et al., 2016). In Thailand and Sudan, at night the birds are kept under a bamboo basket also (Chantong and Kaneene, 2011, Wani et al., 2014). On the North Island of New Zealand, most of the farms (68%) allow free movement of chickens and ducks in nearby pastures, including access to waterways, such as ponds, streams, rivers, and drains (Zheng et al., 2010). In Bangladesh, most of the farmers (55%) keep the birds within their houses, and others keep them in a coop in the front yard. The coop is made of soil or wood and it has a tin shade (Alam et al., 2014; Sultana et al., 2012a). The majority of the farmers prefer to keep the birds on a wooden perch constructed inside their own houses in Ethiopia (Yemane et al., 2013). Resting of the birds on treetops at night was observed in South Pacific island countries (Ajuyah, 1999). Development of brick houses for the poultry is rarely observed (4%) in India (West Bengal) (Banerjee, 2012). During crisis periods, such as flooding the farmers keep the chickens in a cage and hang the cage inside the room as observed in Bangladesh (Sultana et al., 2012a).",

In Asian countries, such as in India, Bangladesh, and Thailand, women also offer the supplementary feed and drinking water from local ponds to the birds once or twice in a day (Chantong and Kaneene, 2011; Sultana et al., 2012a; Samanta et al., 2016).

In New Zealand, chickens were usually homebred (39%) (Zheng et al., 2010). In Bangladesh, the women of the family select a space within their bedroom or on the windowsill for the chickens to lay and brood eggs. However, ducks prefer to lay the eggs where they stay at night (Sultana et al., 2012a). The farmers utilize other sources of birds to introduce new birds in the existing flocks. Examples of other sources include neighbors, local markets, commercial farms, breeders, shows/auctions, and government supported developmental schemes. In Chile, 32% of the studied population used the other sources to purchase new birds (Hamilton-West et al., 2012). In New Zealand, 37% of the owners obtained the chickens privately, and a few people (11%) bought the chicken from local commercial dealers (Zheng et al., 2010). In Ethiopia, an average of 28.3 chickens were added to a flock annually (Yemane et al., 2013).

The bird keepers (50%) also used supplemental grit and calcium for their birds, especially for the laying hens (Elkhorabi et al., 2014). In New Zealand, the majority of the keepers use purchased feeds (Lockhart et al., 2010). In the European Union, countries feeding kitchen scraps (except raw vegetables from the garden) to the food-producing animals, including chickens kept as pets, is banned since 2001 to prevent the transmission of zoonotic infections. Access of poultry to the compost mass containing kitchen waste is also restricted (Whitehead and Roberts, 2014).",

The transmission of zoonotic AIV has so far (January 2014) generated 650 human cases with 386 deaths (WHO, 2014.). Among different subtypes of AIV, H5 and H7 are considered as pathogenic and are frequently isolated from chicken, turkeys, quails, and pheasants (Suarez et al., 2003). Ducks and shorebirds mostly carry H3, H4, H6, H9, H11, and H13 sybtypes of AIV (Suarez and Schultz-Cherry, 2000). Genetic reassortment between Avian and swine influenza can occur and generate a new subtype. H2N3 is an example of a reassorted subtype that was detected in backyard birds and swine in Ohio (Killian, 2009). China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, and Egypt are considered as endemic countries for highly pathogenic Avian influenza (H5N1) infection in poultry. In addition, sporadic outbreaks of H5N1 infection are observed in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar Cambodia, and Nepal (FAO, 2013).",

In 2007, backyard flocks accounted for 89% of the AI outbreaks in poultry. The infection was further confirmed in human patients having exposure to the backyard flocks (Kandeel et al., 2010). Moreover, higher infection rates of AIV (H5 and H9) were observed in backyard birds and birds from local bird markets in comparison to birds from commercial farms in Egypt (Osman et al., 2015). Furthermore, a higher prevalence of AIV was reported in backyard flocks that had mixed populations of chickens and waterfowls together (El-Zoghby et al., 2013). Two clades of HPAI-H5N1 are circulating in Egypt, known as Classic 2.2.1 and Variant 2.2.1 strains (Hafez et al., 2010). The Classic strain originated from ducks (Saad et al., 2007) and currently is maintained in backyard birds. The Variant strain has been circulating in commercial poultry since late 2007 (Hafez et al., 2010). The phylogenetic analysis of HPAI strains from Egypt revealed close relationship with the H5N1 viruses circulating in Gaza and Israel, suggesting a common virus progenitor (El Bakrey et al., 2015). Similarly in Libya, HPAI-H5N1 belonged to 2.2.1 lineage having similarities with Egyptian isolates. It was detected in backyard flocks (Kammon et al., 2015).",

The study with the scenario of the tree modeling approach in backyard flocks in Thailand also revealed the high probability to be free from H5N1 infection (Goutarda et al., 2012). However, the backyard flocks in other Asian countries possess the AIV. Evidence of H5N1 AIV was observed in a village backyard flock in Kandal province in Cambodia (Theary et al., 2012). In Pakistan, two highly pathogenic subtypes (H5N1 and H7N3) caused a sporadic AI outbreak in poultry in 1999. Vaccination was done in poultry against H5, H7, and H9 subtypes to control the infection. As a consequence of reassortment with vaccine strains a more virulent subtype (H9N2) of the virus appeared, which crossed the species barrier and further infected human. This reassorted subtype (H9N2) possessed a nonstructural gene segment of H5N1, which increased the capacity of the virus to adapt to new hosts (due to IFN-\u03b2 inhibitory activity) and environments (Munir et al., 2013). Currently the existence of H9N2 subtype is also detected in apparently healthy backyard flocks in Pakistan. So, the backyard flocks in Pakistan act as asymptomatic carrier of H9N2 with increased possibility of human transmission (Munir et al., 2013). The H9N2 virus circulating in Pakistan belonged to the G1 lineage of virus (Qa/HK/G1/97), which was also common in Hong Kong (Iqbal et al., 2009). H9N2 originated in turkeys in 1966 (Homme and Easterday, 1970). Since then it has been considered as a low pathogenic strain (LPAI) and is panzootic in multiple Avian species in Asia, Middle East, Africa, and Europe (Capua and Alexander, 2004). The property of cross species transmission to human was first detected in 1997 in Hong Kong and China, which also originated from poultry (Peiris et al., 1999, Butt et al., 2005).",

            "text": "In Bangladesh (Asia), H9N2 subtype of LPAI is frequently detected in commercial poultry and backyard flocks that are phylogenetically related to South Asian and Middle East isolates (Parvin et al., 2014). Moreover, H9N2 isolates of Bangladesh also possessed the evidence of reassortment between H7N3 and H5N1 subtypes like their counterparts in Pakistan (Parvin et al., 2014). A low proportion (7%) of backyard birds in Bangladesh die every day due to HPAI infection. Clinical study showed that cyanotic comb and wattle are frequently observed in both commercially farmed and backyard poultry (P = 0.44), but edema of the head and face, drowsiness, and huddling were more common in backyard farms (P = 0.03; P = 0.02) (Biswas et al., 2011a, Biswas et al., 2011b). Furthermore, full genome analysis of HPAI viruses (H5N1) isolated from poultry including backyard flocks in Bangladesh revealed the evidence of reassortment between two circulating clades of viruses (2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.2) and also between HPAI (H5N1) and LPAI (H9N2) strains (Gerloff et al., 2014). The virus clade 2.3.2.1 was introduced in Bangladesh after 2010 and the strain spread into different places and species (chickens, crows) in the country (Islam et al., 2012). The AIV belonged to similar lineage with Bangladeshi isolates were also detected in Nepal suggesting the transboundary transmission either through trade or wild birds (Nagarajan et al., 2012). Similarly in India (neighbouring country of Bangladesh) the existence of HPAI-H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1 was observed in poultry since 2011 (Nagarajan et al., 2012). Until 2010, the clade 2.2 dominated in Indian poultry (Chakrabarti et al., 2009, Pattnaik et al., 2006).",

Among the chicken mites, three species were most prevalent [Ornithonyssus sylviarum (15%), Knemidocoptes mutans (10%), Dermanyssus gallinae (5%)]. It is noteworthy to mention that these parasites were exclusively detected in backyard flocks, not in commercial layers in California (Murillo and Mullens, 2016). Backyard flocks kept in and around the Mississippi river delta suffered from black fly (Simulium spp.) infestations. The external signs, such as cutaneous hemorrhagic lesions and a huge numbers of black flies within the digestive tract of the birds (after post mortem) were found. Black flies can also transmit some blood protozoa (Leucocytozoon spp., Haemoproteus spp.), which cause further infection in the affected poultry. Moderate occurrence (26%) of Leucocytozoon spp. was detected in black fly infested backyard flocks (Jones et al., 2015).",

However, a lower isolation rate was reported by (Jafari et al., 2007, Namata et al., 2009 and Leotta et al., 2010) who found 5.8, 6, and 3.5% as Salmonella prevalence in backyard chicken flock in Iran, Belgium, and Paraguay, respectively. In a study in backyard birds (RIR breed) in India (West Bengal), the isolation rate of Salmonella was 15%. Salmonella isolates were also obtained from feed (10%), drinking water (20%), and eggs (10%) of the studied backyard flocks. No Salmonella was detected from utensil swabs, litter, swab from the wall of the poultry house, dried manure under the house, and soil collected from all the studied agroclimatic zones. Salmonella isolation rate was significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with a higher-age group of the backyard birds (20\u201326 weeks) as compared to the middle- or lower-age group. Further, none of the Salmonella isolates possessed extended spectrum \u03b2 lactamase (ESBL) genes probably due to a lack of antibiotic exposure (Samanta et al., 2014a). Transmission of antimicrobial-resistance genes into the commensal flora may take place in the intestinal tract of animals, including birds (Gustafson and Bowen, 1997). Specifically, the ESBL enzymes are increasingly expressed by many strains of bacteria with a potential for dissemination. These ESBLs diminish the activity of wide-spectrum antibiotics, creating major therapeutic difficulties in treatment of the patients (Samanta et al., 2015a).",

The reconstituted vaccine should be used within a short period of time to avoid the loss of potency (Merck Animal Health, 2013). Further, in remote villages, accessibility of the vaccines, proper diluents, cold chain, and, moreover, qualified paraveterinarians are limited. In some countries, such as in Ethiopia, the vaccines are produced locally, which also creates challenges, such as irregular supply of specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs, required for sustainable vaccine production (Sambo et al., 2015). Consequently, production and supply of vaccine is often hampered. Because of all these factors, conventional vaccination is not usually performed in most of the backyard flocks each year to prevent the outbreaks.",

In Java (Indonesia), a large-scale mass vaccination was carried out to control outbreaks of HPAI in backyard flocks, and positive titer to H5 was detected in 20%\u201345% of poultry sampled in the mass vaccination area. In the HPAI-ND combined vaccination group, 12%\u201325% of the population had positive ND titers, compared to 5%\u201313% in the areas without ND vaccination (McLAWS et al., 2015). In another study in Indonesia, the results suggested that the HPAI-ND combined vaccination significantly reduced the incidence of HPAI in backyard poultry (Bett et al., 2005). Several types of inactivated H5N1 and H5N2 vaccines were also used in Egypt to control HPAI outbreaks (Abdelwhab and Hafez, 2011). However, use of live vaccine against HPAI is a controversial issue, and it is presumed that such vaccination against HPAI in China helped in the evolution of more virulent virus strain (Smith et al., 2006). In Pakistan, too, it is speculated that import of live poultry and extensive use of live vaccines can pose a huge risk for the emergence of new NDV strain (Munir et al., 2012). In most of the endemic countries, such as in India, vaccination is not practiced to control the HPAI infection in poultry. Culling or stamping out birds in a 3\u20135 km declared infected area is the official policy to control the outbreak in India (DADF, 2013). The metapopulation dynamic study of a poultry population in the United States demonstrated the effectiveness of culling in reducing the number of outbreaks in large poultry populations (Hosseini et al., 2013).",

In addition, doorstep services are also unavailable, especially in the remote villages (Debnath et al., 2011). The landless or marginal farmers also could not afford the treatment or vaccine costs (Indian Rupees 75 or US$ 1.15 per bird/year) (SAPPLPP, 2009). This is the probable reason the backyard birds reared in this part of India are not exposed to the antimicrobials and thus the commensal (E. coli, Salmonella spp.) present in the birds do not possess major antibiotic resistance genes (Samanta et al., 2015b). In Bangladesh, sometimes the farmers prefer to collect the medicines and suggestions from the local medicine shops. The farmers also avoid the government animal health centers due to lack of proper diagnosis and availability of poultry medicines (Sultana et al., 2012b). The reluctance of owners to seek veterinary attention was also noted even in developed countries, such as the United States (2.9% farmers use veterinary service), the United Kingdom, and Chile (Garber et al., 2007, Hamilton-West et al., 2012, Karabozhilova et al., 2012). The urban backyard farmers in the United States mostly use dewormers (coccidiostats) and antibiotics in larger flocks (<20) of birds (Elkhorabi et al., 2014). In Chile, the backyard birds were sometimes treated with the drugs approved for human use, which could be responsible for presence of drug residues in the poultry products (Greenlees, 2003). The Animals and Animal Products (Examination for Residues and Maximum Residue Limits) Regulations, 1997, control residues of medicines in food animals, including poultry, in European Union countries. These regulations divide medicinal substances into three categories: allowed, prohibited, and unlisted. Use of prohibited/unlisted medicines in poultry (commercial and backyard) is illegal (Table 14.1\n) (Whitehead and Roberts, 2014).",

In Brazil, ash is applied on the body of backyard birds to prevent parasite infestation. In Nigeria, the ashes after burning of Nicotiana rustica, N. tabacum, or Carica papaya leaves are used. This is rubbed into the plumage to protect against parasitic infestation. Shea butter is used as a curative method against bird scabies. Palm oil is used especially against fleas and mites. Tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tabacum) provide protection for approximately 1 month against Sarcoptes, Psoroptes, and Demodex (Salifou et al., 2013). In Bangladesh, Indonesia and China, the sick birds are slaughtered and consumed when the treatment fails (Padmawatia and Nichterb, 2008, Sultana et al., 2012b, Zhang and Pan, 2008).",

            "text": "The zoonotic pathogens, such as HPAI are transmitted to humans from the backyard birds through direct or indirect contact. The direct contact takes place while walking through the flocks and handling sick poultry and while slaughtering poultry personally without appropriate protection (Burns et al., 2011, Liao et al., 2009). At the time of slaughter, the most commonly identified risk factors were direct contact with infected blood or other body fluids (Van Kerkhove et al., 2011). Associated risk factors related to environmental exposure include cleaning poultry areas, removal of feces, using poultry waste as fertilizer, inhalation, ingestion, and intranasal inoculation of contaminated water (Van Kerkhove et al., 2011). Indirect contact is more frequent and takes place when backyard farmers are exposed to apparently healthy poultry without any precautions (Rabinowitz et al., 2010) and when the farmers meet with each other (Burns et al., 2011). Backyard poultry acted as greater source of HPAI transmission than the commercial birds due to the absence of biosecurity measures. It is also estimated that average daily contact rate of humans was higher with the backyard flocks than with commercial poultry (0.0137 or 5 contacts per year) (Patyka et al., 2013). Rural people are at higher risk of HPAI transmission than their urban counterparts due to greater amount rearing of these backyard birds. Besides from being an essential component of rural livelihood, poultry rearing is also an important sector of the agricultural ecosystems. The droppings of chickens are used to feed aquatic animals and as soil fertilizers, which facilitates pathogen transmission (Liao et al., 2014). Moreover, Asian rural people prefer to take freshly slaughtered poultry than the packaged and processed meat. In a study in Southeast Asia, it was observed that almost all Vietnamese and more than half of the Thai people slaughtered the birds by themselves at home. This kind of practice also increases the possibility of disease transmission (Liao et al., 2014). Cock fighting (a traditional recreation in rural Asia) with backyard birds may also play a role in disease transmission. The owners transport their birds long distances to participate in bouts and sometimes they lick the wounds on their fighting cocks (Edmunds et al., 2013). More hazardous practices, such as keeping birds inside the bedroom, scavenging of birds around the places where food is cooked, using the same water source where villagers bath or wash their utensils for the birds\u2019 drinking were observed in Bangladesh (Sultana et al., 2012b).",

During that period (2008), an HPAI outbreak in humans was detected, which was also followed by two subsequent human cases. In all these cases, the etiological virus belonged to clade 2.2.2 with other similar genetic characteristics indicating the cross-transmission from the poultry (Brooks et al., 2010). In Vietnam, most of the human exposure (96%) to HPAI occurred from the backyard poultry (Fielding et al., 2007). In Thailand, during 2007\u201310, 25 confirmed H5N1 cases in humans were detected of which 17 persons died (WHO, 2010). The history of direct contact to the backyard chickens and free-grazing ducks appeared to be related to H5N1 infections in humans in Thailand (Chantong and Kaneene, 2011). In China, a total of 46 H7N9 infections were identified in the Zhejiang province in humans during 2013. All the live poultry markets were closed and backyard poultry were slaughtered to control the outbreak in the locality (Gong et al., 2014). In Beijing (China), farmers who reared ducks in their backyards possessed antibody against Avian influenza, but they never vaccinated, indicating the means for possible transmission (Ma et al., 2012). Using logistic regression, it was shown that backyard poultry could act as a source of Campylobacter jejuni infection to children (El-Tras et al., 2015).",

In South Asia, domestic ducks were the major risk factor for HPAI persistence and transmission into the backyard poultry (Gilbert and Pfeiffer, 2012). In Madagascar, the high density of ducks (palmipeds) and prevalent rice paddies were associated with AI infection in backyard birds (Andriamanivo et al., 2012). The water bodies and their banks or rice paddies are contaminated with the virus excreted by the reservoir ducks. The virus survives in the lower temperature of the water. The backyard flocks are exposed to the contaminated water and the virus is transmitted through oral route. So the presence of water bodies adjacent to the backyard farm is considered a major risk factor for the transmission of pathogens. Other than ducks, wild birds found around the water bodies, such as teals (Anas chlorotis), swans (Cygnus atratus), shags (Phalocrocorax carbo), seagull (Larus Novaehollandiae Scopulinus), pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), and hawks (Circus approximans) also play an important role in transmission of HPAI in backyard flocks (Zheng et al., 2010). Sparrows (Passer domesticus) and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) most commonly visit the place where the backyard flocks are kept. Both sparrows and starlings are susceptible to experimental HPAI infection (Boon et al. 2007) and thus may act as a source of infection for the backyard birds. Moreover, in a metapopulation dynamics study, it was observed that movement of AI virus between commercial and backyard poultry may contribute to the maintenance of outbreaks in an area, but direction of the viral transmission cannot be predicted (Farnsworth et al., 2011).",

A number of farmers identified dogs bringing infected carcasses home to be an additional risk factor for transmission of infection (Sambo et al., 2015).

It is an approach with a focus on maintaining or improving the health status of the birds and preventing the introduction of new pathogens by assessing all the possible risks (Permin and Detmer, 2007). In rural backyard farming specially in developing countries, biosecurity measures are not practiced due to a lack of awareness and high cost of the measures (Samanta et al., 2015c). For example, the cost of a hen house in Cambodia (Southeast Asia) is US$ 25, whereas, the average monthly income of a Cambodian family is US$ 75 (Conan et al., 2013). A study conducted in a broiler farm in Finland detected 3.55 Euro cents (US$ 0.04) per bird as an average biosecurity cost (Siekkinen et al., 2012). In Bangladesh, although government circulated 10-point biosecurity measures to prevent AIV transmission, the backyard farmers ignored these recommendations because they were unable to identify the infection and measure the transmission risk. Most of the farmers considered the disease as fate or God\u2019s will or due to exposure to evil gas and air (Sultana et al., 2012b). After confirmation of human H5N1 infections in Anhui Province (China), the provincial government decreed that all backyard poultry must be kept in cages but the authority failed to implement the law (Kaufman, 2008). Similarly, poultry farmers of Indonesia (Java) and China (Haining) ignored the biosecurity practices due to lack of knowledge regarding zoonotic potentiality of Avian influenza (Padmawatia and Nichterb, 2008, Zhang and Pan, 2008).",

The materials used to build the chicken sheds, such as mud and cow dung made it difficult for sufficient cleaning with chemical disinfectants (Sambo et al., 2015). In Ghana, general biosecurity practices, such as hand washing after handling poultry, was low in the farmers (Odoom et al., 2012). In Bangladesh, the farmers who kept the birds in the sheds, cleaned the sheds every 2\u20134 days. The dried poultry feces and other debris were collected in a basket and directly used as fertilizer. The sick birds were mostly slaughtered for consumption. Hand washing with soap after slaughter, cleaning up the slaughter place in the yard with detergent was rarely practiced. The offals and visceras after slaughter were thrown into the nearest water bodies and bushes (Sultana et al., 2012b). Similarly in India (West Bengal), a low level of biosecurity awareness was observed among the backyard farmers, such as preparation of feed with boiled water (only 3% of the cohort), cleaning of feeding utensils and the drinking trough once in a month (90%), frequency of change of drinking water in the trough in 15 days interval (90%), frequency of change of litter in 15 days (90%), and storage of eggs at room temperature (93%). Majority of the farmers (60%) did not wash their hands before providing feed to the birds and before entry or exit of the poultry houses (Table 14.2\n) (Samanta et al., 2015c).",

            "text": "In developed countries, a moderate level of biosecurity awareness among the backyard farmers was observed probably due to higher education and socioeconomic conditions. In Chile, dead or sick backyard birds were neither consumed nor sold (Hamilton-West et al., 2012). In European Union countries, consumption of birds kept for the purpose\nof showing or as pets is prohibited (Whitehead and Roberts, 2014). In New Zealand, poultry waste was composted prior to use as fertilizer on pastures or gardens to reduce the possibility of disease transmission (Zheng et al., 2010). In Canada (British Columbia), the biosecurity measures, such as limiting human visitors to the flock, isolation of new and sick birds, use of footbaths during entry or exit of the shed, changing clothes when returning home, designing pens to decrease risk of wild bird contact, and not sharing equipments were observed (Burns et al., 2011, Yendell et al., 2012). In the United States, the keepers of the backyard flocks followed similar kind of biosecurity measures, especially hand washing after handling the birds (Beam et al., 2013). However, majority of them did not use separate clothes to enter the coops and allowed visitors in the coop area. Feed and water of their birds were accessible to wild birds and rodents. The keepers were mostly unaware about the disease transmission possibility associated with the presence of wild birds or rodents (Elkhorabi et al., 2014). Lack of knowledge regarding the sources of infection and transmission pathways is still deficient among bird keepers, even in developed countries (Beam et al., 2013, Burns et al., 2011, Garber et al., 2007, Karabozhilova et al., 2012, Lockhart et al., 2010).",

This discrepancy was explained by the fact that measures were often costly and may not be correlated with the economic benefits of the farmers (Aini, 2000). In Bangladesh, the biosecurity recommendation issued by the government to decrease the transmission of AI was not followed by the farmers because change in practices caused financial losses (Sultana et al., 2012b). In India (West Bengal), a cost-effective, agroclimatic zone-specific biosecurity strategy was developed for backyard farmers. The strategy stressed daily cleaning of the utensils with ash, offering potable drinking water to the birds, preparation of feed with boiled water, daily change of drinking water in the trough, sprinkling of detergent water left after washing of clothes in the scavenging area, disposal of carcasses by garden burial, washing of the eggs, storage of the eggs in cold temperature maintained by indigenous structures, and so forth. The strategy was moderately well adopted among the farmers due to its cost-effective nature and the ease of administration. Adoption of such strategies caused change in practices (Table 14.2) and as a consequence, the egg production level in the studied village increased (Samanta et al., 2015c).\n",

Other than chicken as the primary species, turkeys, geese, ducks, Muscovy ducks, quail, pigeons, and guinea fowl are reared by backyard farming throughout the world. The birds are kept by permanent confinement, free-range, and mixed confinement. In developing countries, the backyard poultry sector mostly suffers from two infectious diseases, such as AI and ND due to lack of biosecurity and proper vaccination. The zoonotic pathogens, such as HPAI are transmitted to human from the backyard birds through direct or indirect contact. In rural backyard farming, especially in developing countries, biosecurity measures are not practiced due to lack of awareness and high cost of the measures. In developed countries, a moderate level of biosecurity awareness among the backyard farmers was observed probably due to higher education and socioeconomic condition.
