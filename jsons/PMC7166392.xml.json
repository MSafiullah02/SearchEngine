            "text": "Exosomes (endogenous nanocarriers that are 30\u2013120 nm in diameter) are secreted by a variety of cell types, such as epithelial, dendritic, and tumor cells (Mu, Rana, & Z\u00f6ller, 2013). Such nanocarriers are also present in body fluids such as blood, urine, amniotic effusions, malignant ascites, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, synovial fluid, and breast milk. Additionally, they have been found in the supernatants of different cell types grown in culture (Mu et al., 2013; Simpson, Jensen, & Lim, 2008; Wang et al., 2014). Such nanocarriers were first described 25 years ago in mature sheep reticulocytes involved in the externalization of the transferrin receptor (Simpson et al., 2008). These vesicles can deliver biological information between cells through various surface adhesion proteins and ligands including tetraspanins, integrins, and CD11b and CD18 receptors (Batrakova and Kim, 2015). Exosomes are also involved in the presentation of antigens to T cells, transfer of surface receptors from one cell to another, signal transduction, and the development of tolerance (Th\u00e9ry et al., 2002; Vlassov, Magdaleno, Setterquist, & Conrad, 2012). They are formed from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) created by inward budding of late endosomes in the form of isolated intraluminal vesicles (ILV) and subsequently released to the extracellular milieu upon fusion with plasma membranes. The lipid\u2010driven pathway, which uses the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) system together with ESCRT\u2010independent pathways, is critically involved in ILV formation (Wang et al., 2014). Sphingolipid ceramide and the phospholipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) are considered important lipids in the process of ILV formation, which facilitates the inward transformation of the membrane. Evidently, lipids contribute to the creation of ILVs out of MVBs, but, on the other hand, ESCRTs are involved in cargo sorting (Batrakova & Kim, 2015). Moreover, plasma membrane proteins and cytoplasmic molecules are incorporated into the exosomes during its biogenesis, but this mechanism is not fully understood. Exosomes share some structural elements irrespective of the origin of the cell that produced them, while some molecules are specific to a cell\u2010derived exosome and reflect the physiological state of the cell that produced them (Schorey & Bhatnagar, 2008; Vlassov et al., 2012). These nanocarriers also confer an endocytic pathway for protein export through scission from the limiting endosome, which result in cell type specific proteins enclosed in the membrane of the parent cell, with the unique property of homing selectivity and the same topological orientation (Green, Langer, & Anderson, 2008; Simpson et al., 2008). These cell type\u2010specific proteins determine an exosome's functionality (Simpson et al., 2008). Hence, transmembrane proteins, such as lactadherin, lysosome associated membrane protein\u20102B (LAMP\u20102b), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), heat shock protein, and annexins are common to all exosomes and can be utilized for targeted gene delivery associated with homing peptides on the surface of exosomes (Alvarez\u2010Erviti et al., 2011; Vlassov et al., 2012; Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016). In addition, exosomes have specific proteins that distinguish them from microvesicles, such as alix, TSG101, and tetraspanins (CD9, CD63) (Simpson et al., 2008). Initially, exosomes were thought to be a cellular mechanism to remove unwanted components. However, exosomes are now considered as a natural carrier of many signaling molecules, and thus play an important role in the pathogenesis of many diseases involved with the immune system, sepsis, cardiovascular, and cancer (Ogorevc, Kralj\u2010Iglic, & Veranic, 2013). Furthermore, exosomes and their modified variants can be used as vectors for cancer therapy by the delivery of drugs, microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), mitochondrial DNA, genomic DNA, and recombinant proteins (Banizs et al., 2014). Therefore, tumor\u2010associated exosomes may represent an important biological defense and regulatory mechanism during cancer development and progression. Moreover, exosome\u2010mediated delivery of cell\u2010derived cargos might provide tissue\u2010specific biomarkers which would allow for the diagnosis of cancer growth at early stages, heart disease, pregnancy, and infections (Th\u00e9ry et al., 2002). In this review, we have chosen to focus on different delivery approaches of noncoding RNAs and therapeutic drugs using exosomes.",

            "text": "RNAi\u2010based therapy, which is performed with both small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), has been demonstrated to be one of the most important strategies for target\u2010specific gene silencing (Kooijmans, Vader, van Dommelen, van Solinge, & Schiffelers, 2012). However, in spite of major advances in the field of RNAi, only a few clinical trials have been performed. Poor bioavailability, rapid hydrolysis, and the inability to cross biological barriers, such as blood\u2010brain barrier, are major concerns for the successful clinical application of siRNAs (Schorey & Bhatnagar, 2008). Investigations have revealed that naked siRNA has a natural affinity for gene silencing in the spleen, kidney, and liver. Conversely, exosome\u2010encapsulated siRNAs have no affinity to the aforementioned tissues, but undergo a more specific uptake (Ogorevc et al., 2013). It requires two critical steps to efficiently deliver miRNAs or siRNAs to a specific tissue while maintaining their expression capacity; targeting to the desired tissue and subsequent delivery across the cell membrane (Alvarez\u2010Erviti et al., 2011). Many siRNA and miRNA delivery methods have been developed based on viral and non\u2010viral vectors used for gene delivery. Although, viral delivery generally leads to long\u2010term gene silencing in the target tissue, the safety of viral vectors is still a matter of concern. Viral delivery has inherent drawbacks, for example, it can result in the activation of complement or coagulant factors in the blood circulation. Moreover, viruses can be recognized by preexisting antibodies in the blood stream. There are also safety issues regarding dysregulation of gene expression in the desired tissue, which might lead to malignant transformation and several other complications, thus limiting the application of viral vectors in clinical practice (Green et al., 2008; Hornung et al., 2008). Non\u2010viral delivery systems involving synthetic carriers, such as polyethyleneimmine (PEI) nanoparticles or liposomes, are promising alternatives because of their ability to encapsulate siRNAs, protect them from degradation in the bloodstream, and facilitate cellular uptake. However, although non\u2010viral delivery systems have surpassed safety concerns when compared to viral vectors, there are potential problems related to inadequate transfection efficiency, induction of a pro\u2010inflammatory response, and apoptosis in vivo (Green et al., 2008; Hornung et al., 2008; Kooijmans et al., 2012). Exosomes have some features that are common to liposomes including having a phospholipid bilayer and being composed of biocompatible substances (Dang Xitong, 2015). It has been established that exosomes have benefits of a natural vehicle for transferring siRNAs with high target specificity and lack of immunologic reactions. This nanocarrier also has the properties of efficient uptake in host cells due to their unique composition of endogenously synthetized lipid, protein, and RNA, which is not found in other delivery systems (Kooijmans et al., 2012). According to some reports, exosome\u2010mediated delivery systems are well tolerated both in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the MTT cytotoxicity test and immunological assessments (Ogorevc et al., 2013). In comparison with other existing gene therapy vehicles, repeated administration of exosomes did not activate the host immune response (Hornung et al., 2008). Hence, it has been suggested that exosomes have benefits of both synthetic nanocarriers and cell\u2010mediated drug delivery systems, but lack most of their limitations.",

            "text": "Many studies have demonstrated the existence of RNA (such as mRNA and miRNA) in exosomes that were derived from different cell types, transferred miRNAs between cells, and consequently suppressed target genes (Adlakha & Saini, 2014; Kooijmans et al., 2012). Thus, exosomes have the advantage of being a nano\u2010sized, cell\u2010based delivery system that is considered an effective vehicle for the targeted delivery of both endogenous and exogenous payloads (Green et al., 2008). miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that control specific target mRNAs and inhibit gene expression at either the post\u2010transcriptional or transcriptional level (Banizs et al., 2014). In contrast to siRNAs that are well\u2010known for sequence specificity and used to regulate the expression of one specific gene, miRNAs regulate functionality of several genes related to a signaling pathway or even multiple cross\u2010talking signaling pathways. These can increase their potential for off\u2010target effects (Adlakha & Saini, 2014; Kooijmans et al., 2012). Similar to the limitations related to the delivery of siRNA, miRNA properties require a suitable delivery system. Endogenous miRNAs can be encapsulated into exosomes to protect them from endonuclease degradation. Although synthetic miRNAs have a short half\u2010life in the blood stream, various chemical modifications can be utilized to improve their loading into exosomes (Dang Xitong, 2015; Kooijmans et al., 2012; Zhang, Wang, & Gemeinhart, 2013).",

            "text": "GW182 and argonaute2 (AGO2), which are considered as two main components of RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC), suggest that exosomes are the site for miRNA accumulation and, possibly, gene silencing (Montecalvo et al., 2012). Most importantly, the association of GW182 and AGO2 with MVBs may be involved with the sorting of miRNAs into exosomes (Gibbings, Ciaudo, Erhardt, & Voinnet, 2009; Zhang et al., 2013). Naturally occurring RNA carriers secreted from many tumor cells contain miRNAs, which facilitate cell\u2010cell communication during carcinogenesis by environmental chemical induction. This process leads to proliferation in neighboring normal cells. Exosomes loaded with an miRNA inhibitor are considered an effective carrier system compared with conventional transfection methods used to treat disease (Wang et al., 2014). Thus, it has been suggested that exosomes can be used as a natural source of mRNA and miRNAs carriers (Banizs et al., 2014). Consequently, exogenous siRNAs and other types of RNAi, such as miRNAs mimics, can also be loaded into exosomes and transferred to recipient cells (Dang Xitong, 2015; El\u2010Andaloussi et al., 2012). For therapeutic applications, such exosomes can be used both in either an unmodified, or engineered, form (Mu et al., 2013). Unmodified exosomes, which have been derived from various cell types, exhibit desirable therapeutic properties for various applications (Zitvogel et al., 1998). Although exosomes may be generated from many cell types (e.g., bone marrow, blood, monocytes, or macrophages), a few have been chosen for the delivery of drugs or short nucleic acids. Immature dendritic cells provide an untapped source of exosomes devoid of any T\u2010cell activators and are a suitable source for vaccination purposes. Furthermore, exosomes derived from endothelial cells provide an appropriate source of exosomes to deliver siRNAs to endothelial cells without any unnecessary components from nonendothelial origin. Deriving exosomes from different types of cells may confer different compositions and functions (Banizs et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Different strategies have been employed to describe exosome\u2010based delivery systems. From the point of RNA therapy, exosomes can be loaded with therapeutic miRNAs and siRNAs using different methods. Electroporation represents just one broadly applicable method to introduce exogenous RNAs and other therapeutic molecules onto the surface of purified exosomes. Alvarez\u2010Ervitiz and others have successfully utilized electroporation to introduce siRNA into dendritic cell (DC)\u2010derived exosomes, which had been modified to express rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG)\u2010derived peptide fused with the integral exosomal membrane protein, Lamp2b, to trigger neuronal cells to knock down expression of the desired gene in vivo (Alvarez\u2010Erviti et al., 2011; Ogorevc et al., 2013). RVG exosomes could be used for long\u2010term silencing of genes related to neurodegenerative disease. However, electroporation may not be effective for some configurations of RNAs such as miRNA and shRNA, which contain numerous chemical modifications (Dang Xitong, 2015). Therefore, the quality of exosomes prepared by electroporation depends on the conditions used, for example, buffers for resuspending the exosomes (van der Meel et al., 2014). The electroporation protocol used for loading siRNA into exosomes has revealed conflicting results and has been reported to be hampered by the negative charge of siRNA. Thus, siRNA complexes within a cationic liposome, followed by fusion with the exosome, may overcome many of the limitations associated with expulsion of the siRNA from the extracellular vesicle (Wang et al., 2014). Moreover, a slightly elevated temperature (37\u00b0C) may improve the loading of siRNAs into the exosome (van der Meel et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Another way for incorporating RNAs into exosomes is through overexpression of the cargo RNAs in the exosome\u2010producing cells. These RNAs (miRNAs, modified miRNAs, and shRNA) were completely functional when incubated with recipient cells and resulted in target gene knockdown (Marcus & Leonard, 2013; Rechavi et al., 2009). This strategy may be combined with the expression of a tissue\u2010targeted protein as a fusion protein with the surface of an exosomal protein. For example, cells can be co\u2010transfected with two vectors, one which encodes the precursor miRNA, and the other which expresses fusion\u2010targeted protein in order to display the targeting peptide on the surface of the exosome during purification, and then miRNAs are packed inside (Alvarez\u2010Erviti et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Cell\u2010penetrating peptides (CPP\u2010exosome) is a good example with which to improve the overall uptake efficiency of exosomes. CPP exosomes, in which a short cationic peptide is fused with Lamp2b and displayed on the surface of the exosome, may be employed as an appropriate cargo that enters cells through the shield of negative charges of the exosome (El\u2010Andaloussi, Holm, & Langel, 2005). Another strategy to introduce miRNAs into exosomes is transient transfection using commercial transfection reagents (Dang Xitong, 2015; Shtam et al., 2013). Exosome display technology is another method to introduce exogenous siRNAs successfully into different kinds of human exosomes (Wahlgren et al., 2012). To use exosomes as a potential therapeutic system, several issues need to be addressed. Studies have shown that exosomes can be easily cleared by the reticuluendothelial system (RES), since many of them accumulate in the liver 24 hr after injection into a mouse tail vein (Ohno et al., 2013). Therefore, several strategies have been developed to target exosomes to specific cellular receptors. One approach to precise delivery of exosome\u2010mediated cargo to a specific cell type is to harness a virus\u2010derived protein or peptide to labeled exosomes. For instance, RVG\u2010exosomes, which display a central nervous system\u2010specific rabies viral glycoprotein, have the ability to deliver siRNA to neural cells by binding to the acetylcholine receptor. On the other hand, untagged exosomes deliver siRNAs to unintended tissues. Virus\u2010modified exosomes represent a new approach to specific targeted delivery. Because there are many similarities between viruses and exosomes, exosomes may be modified by incorporating viral proteins, which may be exploited for specific targeting of the exosomes (Sun et al., 2010). Viral\u2010infected cells that incorporate viral factors like virus\u2010encoded RNA into exosomes could be efficiently delivered into non\u2010infected target cells. Studies have revealed an enhancement of exosomes released from the infection of cells with Rotavirus than non\u2010infected with higher T\u2010cell inhibition, while no viral product was detectable (Barreto et al., 2010). These modified exosomes carrying viral proteins were incorporated into endogenously produced exosomes so as to increase the uptake and delivery of exosomes by the desired target (Alvarez\u2010Erviti et al., 2011; Koppers\u2010Lalic, Hogenboom, Middeldorp, & Pegtel, 2013). For instance, EBV\u2010infected B cells encoded BART miRNAs were transferred through exosomes to multiple uninfected recipient cells including monocyte\u2010derived DC. These EBV\u2010miRNAs accumulated in noninfected recipient cells via exosomes and caused suppression of EBV target genes (Pegtel et al., 2010). Likewise, plasma exosomes, which were derived from the peripheral blood of healthy donors, were able to deliver siRNAs effectively into the target cells (human blood mononuclear cells) (Wahlgren et al., 2012). Exosome\u2010mimetics represent a viable alternative method to deliver miRNA and siRNA directly into the cytoplasm of target cells. The aim of this biotechnological approach has been to synthetize exosomes with a less complex structure and harness only crucial components of natural exosomes required for specific and efficient delivery of the exosomes to the target tissue. Since liposomes have a spherical lipid bilayer structure in common with exosomes, it suggests a logical base for the creation of functional exosome\u2010mimetics.",

These manufactured lipid bilayered membrane vesicles share similar properties to those of exosomes while maintaining the natural targeting capacity and a topology of plasma membrane proteins (Jang & Gho, 2014). Furthermore, exosome\u2010mimetics represent an excellent delivery system, and avoids nonimmunogenic and nontoxic delivery of therapeutic cargos (siRNA and miRNAs) to desired cells (Kooijmans et al., 2012; Puri et al., 2009). Additionally, these exosome\u2010mimetics are a promising nanotechnology to overcome the hurdle of exosome purification and low production yields (Jang & Gho, 2014). In general, the overall efficiency of this exosome\u2010mediated delivery strategy can be achieved through targeting to specific recipient cells and utilizing intracellular mechanisms such as intracellular trafficking and specific modes of exosomal uptake in order to confer the best delivery of the cargo molecules.",

Development of an immune response to PEGylated drugs can result in the accelerated clearance of nanocarriers. For example, PEGylated liposomes lose their circulating properties in the 2nd week after systemic administration in mice (Hornung et al., 2008; Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016). It has been suggested that exosomes may have stealth properties that blunt their clearance by the immune system (Gibbings et al., 2009; Montecalvo et al., 2012; Mu et al., 2013). Exosomal drug formulations have been used to treat many diseases such as cancer, infection, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders (Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016). One of the first examples of the application of exosomes in drug delivery was in targeted delivery of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin to mice with solid tumors. This study revealed a greater anti\u2010tumor effect of targeted doxorubicin\u2010encapsulated exosomes compared with free doxorubicin at equivalent doses (Tian et al., 2014). The superiority of exosomal doxorubicin has also been shown versus liposomal doxorubicin, a finding that has been attributed to the natural orientation of exosomal membrane proteins and their capacity for efficient interaction with the receptors in the target cell plasma membrane (Adlakha & Saini, 2014; Hornung et al., 2008; Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016).

CDCs exosomes stimulated angiogenesis, induced cardiomyocyte proliferation, and reduced apoptosis in vitro. The capacity of these exosomes in regeneration was demonstrated in a chronic myocardial infarction model in rats and was attributed to the reduction of collagen deposition and inducing anti\u2010fibrotic efficacy via paracrine mechanisms (Puri et al., 2009; Xitong & Xiaorong, 2016).

In addition, exosomes derived from MSCs revealed drug\u2010induced regeneration and cardioprotective paracrine effects against myocardial reperfusion or ischemia injury in liver\u2010damaged mouse models, respectively (Ohno et al., 2013; Rechavi et al., 2009; van der Meel et al., 2014).",

Mesenchymal stromal cell\u2010derived exosomes (MEX) suppress the hypoxic activation of signal transduction and activation of STAT3 and the upregulation of the miR\u201017 superfamily, whereas they increase lung levels of miR\u2010204, which are decreased in human pulmonary hypertension. MEX produced by umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells inhibit STAT3 signaling in isolated human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, showing a direct effect of MEX on hypoxic vascular cells. Therefore, MEX exerts a protective effect on the lung and inhibits pulmonary hypertension by suppression of hyperproliferative pathways (Lee et al., 2012).",

A variety of cargos exhibit desired therapeutic effects after exosome\u2010based delivery to particular tissues (Johnsen et al., 2014). Exosomes are also known as a natural way of delivering various large\u2010size proteins. For example, catalase has been incorporated into a nano\u2010based polymer in order to preserve the therapeutic protein against degradation in host cells and improve loading capacity, and then subsequently loaded into exosomes (Beauvillain et al., 2009). Exosomal formulations of catalase are a more versatile strategy to treat inflammatory and degenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). Exosomes have been shown to be readily taken up by neuronal cells in vitro. In fact, a considerable quantity of exosomes was detected in the brains of mice with experimentally induced Parkinson's disease following intranasal administration of catalase\u2010loaded exosomes. The catalase\u2010loaded exosomes provided neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models of PD (Haney et al., 2015). Different strategies have been considered in an attempt to load proteins and other biomolecules into exosomes, including incubation at room temperature, exposure to freeze\u2010thaw cycles, permeabilization with saponin, sonication, or extrusion (Kuate et al., 2007; Prado et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2011). Murine MSC\u2010secreted exosomes were loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) by incubating the parent cells with the drug. Results showed a significant amount of PTX was loaded into the exosomes as demonstrated by HPLC (Beauvillain et al., 2007). A similar result was reported for HepG2 cells that were incubated with different anti\u2010cancer agents such as PTX, etoposide, carboplatin, irinotecan, epirubicin, and mitoxantrone; all of which, resulted in anti\u2010proliferative activity (Lv et al., 2012).",

Their function in cell\u2013cell communication between distant neighboring cells caused researchers to utilize exosomes as a \u201cnext generation\u201d carrier for gene therapy. Moreover, exosomes have many more advantages when compared to all other existing delivery systems, including the fact that they are nanosized vesicles, they exhibit permeability of biological membranes, they have limited safety concerns, as well as immunological inertness, non\u2010mutagenesis, immunomodulatory and regenerative properties, and protein orientation similar to the original cells from which they were derived. Being composed of not only lipid and protein, but also nucleic acids (especially various RNAs), makes exosomes suitable as potential carriers for exogenous cargos, including RNAi and other therapeutic compounds (Fig. 1). Many obstacles associated with RNAi (miRNAs and siRNAs) delivery in vivo have been overcome by exosome\u2010mediated delivery systems. Furthermore, exosomes are capable of delivering exogenous therapeutic agents to a specific tissue. Alvarez and others demonstrated successful targeted RVG\u2010exosome delivery to the brain.",

Exosomes originate as endocytic vesicles through invagination of the cell membrane, which results in the formation of early exosomes and, subsequently, late exosome called MVBs. MVBs contain ILV which are formed from budding of the endosomal membrane and are called exosomes. When MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane, they give rise to the release of exosomes into the extracellular space. (A) Endosomal proteins such as CD9, Alix, and TSG101 may be incorporated into exosomes during their assembly to facilitate this process. (B) AGO2 and GW182 are two important components of the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC), which associate with MVBs so as to mediate miRNA sorting into exosomes. (C) Subsequent fusion of cell\u2010derived exosomes with the plasma membrane through their CD9 (tetraspanin) interaction with surface glycoproteins on target cells gives rise to cytosolic delivery of the siRNA directly. This process is involved in the creation of temporary RNAi. (D) Exosomes originate from inward budding in the lumen of the MVB through which the cytoplasmic content from the cell of origin and also viral components, including mRNA and small non\u2010coding RNA and viral glycoproteins are incorporated into the exosome, and then released as a selective cargo in viral\u2010infected cells. These virus\u2010modified exosomes display the original surface markers and cell membrane as the parent cells. (E) Bioengineered or virus\u2010modified exosomes are designed to express a selective set of proteins and small, non\u2010coding RNAs to target specific receptors. Exosomes then fuse with the endosomal membrane to release their non\u2010coding RNAs into the cytoplasm so as to load siRNA into the RNAi (RISC) complex of the target cells in order to prevent mRNA translation into protein.
