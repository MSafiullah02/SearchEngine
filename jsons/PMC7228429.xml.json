Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, anecdotal reports and our own experience suggested disastrous complications in patients not recognized to have coronavirus who underwent seemingly routine operations.1 Yet while the possibility of occult asymptomatic COVID-19 is a threat, the inability to receive necessary treatments in the course of routine cancer care puts patients at increased risk for cancer-related morbidity and complications.2 It is therefore appropriate that rectal cancer care algorithms be rethought and recommendations adjusted in the setting of this pandemic. During these challenging times, a broader lens must be employed with careful attention to patient safety, caregiver safety, and resource utilization. In this review, we explore the resources necessary for the care of patients with rectal cancer and discuss recommendations for safely modifying rectal cancer treatment plans during this unprecedented time.",

Cancer patients were not only more likely to be infected but also suffered a more severe course, with an increased incidence of intensive care resource utilization, invasive ventilation, and mortality. While the data is still evolving, recent surgery (within 1 month of infection) appears to put cancer patients at even higher risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality, with 75% of patients suffering a severe course of COVID-19. Importantly, this increased morbidity may occur in asymptomatic patients, who were not known to be coronavirus carriers. Given that widespread coronavirus testing is limited and that the sensitivity in patients without symptoms remains poor, every rectal cancer patient must be assumed to be an asymptomatic carrier.1",

These procedures are generally much less resource-intensive than TME as they are typically performed on an outpatient basis and often without the need for general anesthesia. Patients with high-risk features (depth of submucosal invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and location in the lower third of the rectum) may undergo completion TME at a time considered safe from a COVID-19 perspective, or alternatively offered adjuvant chemoradiotherapy if they are unwilling to pursue TME.18,19 If operating room resources are such that there is a long delay to TME, such patients should be recommended chemoradiotherapy. Patients with low-risk T1 cancer may not require any further therapy. Patients with T2 rectal cancer have a 20\u201330% risk of lymph node metastasis and are thus typically recommended to undergo TME, given that local excision results in a 30\u201340% risk of recurrence.20,21",

In the RAPIDO trial, patients were randomized to total neoadjuvant therapy consisting of short-course radiation followed by chemotherapy and surgery versus neoadjuvant long-course radiation followed by surgery with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Authors noted that all patients in the TNT arm received radiation and 84% of patients were able to complete at least 75% of the prescribed chemotherapy, compared with 94% completing radiation and only 57% completing recommended chemotherapy in the adjuvant chemotherapy arm. Forty-eight percent of patients in the TNT arm suffered treatment-related toxicity, versus 25% in the long-course arm. However, there was no difference in the surgical procedures performed or in perioperative morbidity between the two arms. Thus, it appears that TNT is a safe option for the optimal delivery of recommended therapies for rectal cancer.30",

One theory is that chemotherapy may suppress the inflammatory response which otherwise results within a few weeks after radiotherapy. While TNT appears safe and will delay surgery by over 4 months, this must be balanced by the fact that patients must travel to infusion centers biweekly for 3\u20134 months, potentially increasing risk of exposure to COVID-19.",

We recommend that patients with evidence of clinically complete response be considered for a \u201cwatch and wait\u201d protocol and followed closely by physical exam, endoscopy, and imaging. When deciding how to proceed following a near-complete or complete response, it must be emphasized that \u201cwatch and wait\u201d as a treatment modality is still unproven, is not considered standard of care, and should only be offered by providers who are familiar with the stringent surveillance regimen that is required to detect an early recurrence.",

Postoperative patient encounters should be minimized and telehealth, virtual visits, or telephone calls should be used as much as possible. Additionally, earlier and more frequent postoperative virtual visits should be performed which would likely capture early complications, preventing emergency room visits and readmissions.
