The method of dissemination was rapidly and well received by the international community, resulting in locally facilitated translations into Italian, Portuguese, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Polish, Serbian, Farsi, Turkish, traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese and Japanese. All translations were completed and made available for users within a 10\u2010day period. Collaborations also enabled context\u2010specific modifications of the infographic to merge with local practices. For example, double gloving was a technique that the Italian community requested, and the infographic was modified to accommodate this for the Italian translation. As of 19 March 2020, there have been 63,440 impressions on Twitter since publication on 19 February 2020, with many retweets and requests for sharing of the infographic at their respective institutions around the world. There have been 8614 page views on the departmental website since publication on 7 March 2020. More importantly, through social media platforms and personal communication, numerous reputable organisations, including the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists, Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists, Australian Society of Anaesthetists, UK ICM Anaesthesia Covid\u201019 Collaboration, Brazilian Anaesthesiology Society, French Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, and others, have utilised the infographic as a resource for their respective healthcare communities. This redistribution of the material through additional, highly accessed and trusted dissemination platforms markedly increases the value of the infographic, and reduces the need for other individuals and units to waste needed resources reproducing similar material. The rapid uptake and sharing across networks, driven by healthcare workers\u2019 needs, demonstrates \u2018just\u2010in\u2010time\u2019 health professional information sharing.",

In medicine, there is the additional risk of early adoption of unvalidated research or practice, and the risk of future medical reversal 17.

The example provided validates this possibility. In summary, the infographic presented met the majority of above proposed criteria. The success of the dissemination was, we believe, promoted by the existing reputation of the institution, quality of the infographic imagery and content and the rapid dissemination by social media platforms with professional participants. This allowed several institutions to utilise the time\u2010consuming work already done in the original institution, and not have to repeat the investment of time and energy to reproduce similar material. Free and rapid access to high\u2010quality information from verifiable sources is valuable to optimise the global medical response to crises such as the current COVID\u201019 pandemic.",
