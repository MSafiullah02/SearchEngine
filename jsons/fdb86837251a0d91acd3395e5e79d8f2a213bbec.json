            "text": "1. The primary ecological transition of the human population occurred several million years ago with the emergence of our early ancestors in Africa from arboreal habitats into the open savannah. Contact with animals in the savannah resulted in infection with new enzootic agents. This trend continued during the emergence of Homo sapiens and the subsequent migration of Neolithic huntergatherers out of Africa approximately 100,000 years ago. 2. The second transition originated about 10,000 years ago with the development of agriculture, following the domestication of animals and plants. This practice resulted in the establishment of stable settlements, in which the number and density of humans and animals increased, facilitating the transmission of pathogens between species. Ultimately, this enzootic exchange of pathogens led to the development of infectious organisms that were exclusively propagated and maintained within the expanding human population. This mechanism of evolution over the last 10,000 years has been suggested for measles, mumps, rubella, and smallpox. Recently, the emergence of HIV and Hepatitis C from animal sources, and their establishment and global transmission within human populations, have been observed. 3. The third transition was the continental expansion of human populations, which resulted in the geographic isolation of populations that evolved different types of enzootic and human pathogens. When these distinct human populations throughout the Eurasian continent made contact through trade or warfare, catastrophic epidemics ensued. These occurred during the period 1000 BCE and 1500 CE, culminating in the Black Death in 1347 CE, which killed approximately one-third of the European population. 4. The fourth transition was initiated in 1500 CE when Europeans undertook global exploration followed by widespread colonization of countries in Africa, Asia, and the New World. This resulted in the global distribution of infectious diseases and the eradication of naive native populations by the introduction of new diseases such as measles and smallpox. 5. The fifth transition started during the eighteenth century and is characterized by the uncontrolled upward spiral of the human population despite wars, famine, and disease. The growth rate of the human population rose significantly in the eighteenth century, coincident with the European Industrial Revolution, when agricultural practice was rendered more efficient, and manufacturing was facilitated by the application of power-driven machinery.",

            "text": "This trend intensified into the twentieth century when the global population grew from 1.6 billion in 1900 to 6.1 billion by 2000. The bulk of the global population growth occurred after the Second World War, predominantly in the developing world, namely, Asia, Africa, and South America (United Nations, 2004) . In 2005, the global population was about 6.5 billion, with 5.3 billion living in the developing world. The economic and health disparities between the developed and the developing are constantly expanding, with the latter sustaining a tenfold higher infant mortality rate, more than two-thirds of the 13 million deaths due to infectious diseases, and 50% of the population living on less than $2 per day (Roberts & Lu, 2004) . During this period, urban settlements have become the predominant human habitat with estimates of 7% of the world's population living in megacities (United Nations, 2004) . The UN 2000 forecasts that the world's population will increase 30% by 2030 and of these additional 2 billion people, 1.9 billion will live in the cities and towns of South America, Asia, and Africa. Toward the end of this century the majority of the world's population will be living in cities and large towns (United Nations, 2004) . This trend toward urban living and the redistribution of the human population will profoundly impact the profile and spread of infectious diseases. Moreover, during the second half of the twentieth century, the development of global communication and economic interactions has led to an enormous increase in global travel both by air and sea. The redistribution and urbanization of large portions of the human population, together with the vast increase in global air travel, have already dramatically altered the pattern and kinetics of disease dissemination. During the twentieth century, this was clearly demonstrated by the global spread of the chronic diseases AIDS and Hepatitis C, caused by HIV1 and HCV, respectively. In 1999, the coronavirus that originally caused severe acute respiratory syndrome in southern China was globally distributed within 3 months (Vijayanand et al., 2004) , and the flavivirus West Nile Virus introduced into the eastern USA from the Middle East was efficiently disseminated across the continent within 3 years (Petersen & Roehrig, 2001 ).",

The viral genome is divided into eight negative-sense single-stranded linear segments in the type A and B subtypes, and seven segments in the type C virus. Influenza C viruses have been isolated only from humans and swine, where they cause mild upper respiratory tract infections (Baigent & McCauley, 2003) . The influenza B subtype has been isolated only from humans and seals and causes severe disease in humans, including lower respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, and encephalitis (Baigent & McCauley, 2003) . During the first 2 years of the twentyfirst century, the influenza B strain variant B/Victoria/2/87 reemerged from Asia and spread globally, causing widespread human epidemic outbreaks (Shaw et al., 2002) . The influenza A type viruses maintain an extensive subtype reservoir in wild aquatic birds and infect a range of mammals, avian species, and humans. Inducing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, these influenza A type viruses are one of the major causes of human infection and are the focus of this chapter.",

These eight RNA segments encode 11 structural and nonstructural proteins that facilitate cellular uptake, protein synthesis, RNA replication, and the assembly and release of progeny virions. Viral subtypes are defined by the possession of 1 of 15 antigenically distinct hemagglutinins (HA) and 1 of 9 neuraminidase (NA) antigens. The 15 hemagglutinins (H1-H15) and 9 neuraminidases (N1-N9) are perpetuated in nature in shorebirds, waterfowl, and gulls (Alexander, 2000 >; Hinshaw et al., 1980) . In these aquatic wild bird populations, influenza viruses normally replicate without disease symptoms. This genetically diverse reservoir of influenza A subtypes in wild birds is well adapted to its natural hosts and exhibits an evolutionary stasis with minimal variation in its surface protein sequence, suggestive of a longestablished and balanced host and pathogen interactions (Webster et al., 1992) .",

The two viral surface proteins HA and NA interact cooperatively to define this host specificity, by determining the efficiency of viral attachment to, entry into, fusion with, and release from, host cells. The cell surface receptor recognized by HA is sialic acid attached to galactose by either alpha-2,3 Gal or alpha-2,6 Gal linkages (Gambaryan et al., 1995) . The HA of influenza viruses isolated from the avian reservoir bind to sialic acid linked to galactose by an alpha-2,3 linkage and those that infect mammals recognize sialic acid linked to galactose by an alpha-2,6 linkage. The release of viral progeny relies on the NA cleavage of cell surface sialic acid that is linked to galactose in the same structural conformation recognized by the HA. This clearance of sialic acid residues from the cell surface obviates viruscell interactions and facilitates the release of virions from infected cells.",

The tissue distribution of trypsin-like proteases within the host organism restricts virus replication to distinct sites, generally the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The efficiency of HA cleavage is influenced by the structure of its protease cleavage site, and the presence of multiple basic amino acids flanking this site facilitates cleavage by ubiquitous proteases such as furin. The cleavage of HA by ubiquitous proteases that are widely distributed in the host organism permits viral replication at sites throughout the body, resulting in a lethal disease causing major organ and tissue damage. The mutational introduction of basic amino acids flanking the protease cleavage site that enhance and broaden protease recognition has been clearly demonstrated as a major factor in the evolution of nonvirulent avian viruses into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry (Capua & Alexander, 2004) .",

Domestic fowl are infected by a wide range of influenza A subtypes, the majority of which exhibit infections of low virulence characterized by mild respiratory disease and lowered egg production. Highly pathogenic avian influenzas are generally confined to subtypes bearing the surface HA H5 or H7 that cause highly lethal disease with flock mortalities up to 100% (Capua & Alexander, 2004) . Highly pathogenic subtypes display HA H5 or H7 on their surface, which contains multiple basic amino acids proximal to the protease cleavage site. The efficient cleavage of the HA facilitates widespread infection of the avian tissues and the rapid onset of lethal disease. Recent scientific results support the conclusion that wild bird populations propagate influenza strains that exhibit no disease symptoms or those that cause only mild infections (Rohm et al., 1995; Banks et al., 2000 Banks et al., , 2001 . However, highly pathogenic H5 and H7 influenza strains arise in domestic poultry as a result of mutations in nonlethal viruses introduced from wild birds (Garcia et al., 1996; Perdue et al., 1998) .",

This virus caused disease in chickens in Hong Kong and was controlled by the culling of millions of chickens in southern China. Despite these containment efforts, this H5N1 strain spread widely in Southeast Asian countries including Japan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Indonesia, causing widespread lethal infections of domestic poultry (Writing Committee of the World Health Organization Consultation on Human Influenza A/H5, 2005). Wild ducks were shown to propagate and transmit the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus without manifesting disease symptoms, implying their potential role in the dissemination of this lethal subtype throughout Southeast Asia (Sturm-Ramirez et al., 2005) . During mid-2005, it was reported that the H5N1 pathogenic virus caused a lethal epidemic in migratory waterfowl that led to the death of thousands of waterfowl in northwestern China, over 3,000 miles away from its epicenter of origin in southern China . In this case, the avian vector of the pathogenic H5N1 viruses was not clearly established. However, the ongoing global dissemination of pathogenic H5N1 virus is due to its transmission from domestic poultry to wild migratory aquatic birds. Currently, the spread of H5N1 from northwestern China has resulted in the lethal infection of wild birds and domestic poultry in Siberia, the Urals, Turkey, Romania, Iraq, Greece, Italy, and Africa and is threatening the vast domestic poultry stocks in Europe and the Americas.",

It could be due to their population size, genetic composition, conditions of containment, or other factors associated with the monoculture of poultry. However, this increase in highly pathogenic strains of influenza in poultry in the second half of the twentieth century parallels the 244% increase in poultry meat production during this period. Currently, 65% of this meat is generated by four poultry producers, the USA, China, EU, and Brazil, with production in the developing world exceeding that in the developed world in both enclosed and free-range facilities (Tilman, 1999) . This domestication of poultry has established ideal conditions for the growth and rapid evolution of enzootic pathogens such as influenza virus. This has resulted in two unprecedented occurrences: highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus evolved in domestic poultry in 1996 and established global transmission in wild migratory aquatic birds; this pathogenic H5N1 virus grows, directly infects, , and produces lethal disease in humans.",

The majority of the information is derived from documentation in the developed countries, as information from the developing regions is more difficult to assemble and consequently less complete. Even the information from countries with well-established public health systems is not completely reliable, especially during pandemic outbreaks. The compiling of clinical and lethality records was difficult during pandemic outbreaks due to the social disruption caused by the rapid onset of acute disease and its impact on the general population. In addition, it appears that in some instances clinical and lethality records were distorted because of the implementation of inappropriate social and political pressures (Barry, 2004) . Despite the shortcomings of this historical database, it is an important record of the timing and impact of influenza disease within society and highlights the tasks implicit in the control of this disease. However, it would be imprudent to rely on this information as being predictive of the nature and characteristics of future influenza outbreaks, especially because there are dramatic changes in the size, distribution, and disease susceptibility of the human population and its ongoing activities that are driving major evolutionary changes in the biology and pathology of influenza viruses.",

The causative agent of influenza disease was finally established in 1933 by the isolation of a filterable agent, characterized as influenza type A virus, from human patients (Smith et al., 1933) . In the 1940s, influenza virus grown in embryonated eggs was purified and formulated into an inactivated vaccine that was shown to produce protective immunity in human clinical studies. Influenza immunity in humans is principally related to protective antibodies that inactivate the surface protein HA.",

This observation led to an initiative from participants at the International Congress of Microbiology in 1947 to recommend that WHO organize an international effort to survey and collate the global spread of influenza viruses. As a consequence, a program was established by WHO to monitor the global epidemiology of influenza and to isolate new strains and make them available to vaccine manufacturers (Payne, 1953) . Currently, the program is coordinated by five Collaborating Centers in Atlanta, Memphis, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo, collating information from over 110 national laboratories in 82 countries. Sensitive and rapid methods of nucleic acid and protein sequencing and immune-based assays for antibody identification have been harnessed to identify influenza subtypes and variants that infect humans. The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance System coordinates this information on the antigenic variation and the epidemiology of influenza viruses, and this database is used to select new strains and variants for influenza vaccines.",

Potter estimated that during the last three centuries there were ten pandemic outbreaks that occurred on average once every 33 years (Potter, 2001) . During the twentieth century, three pandemic strains emerged, H1N1 in 1918, H2N2 in 1957, and H3N2 in 1968 ; each viral subtype contained a novel HA. Retrospective molecular analyses indicate an avian origin for the HAs in the pandemic strains of 1957 and 1968 (Webster & Laver, 1972; Kawaoka et al., 1989) . The origin of the 1918 HA is unclear. Its sequence is partially related to the avian HA but it may have emerged from a mammalian source and not directly from the avian reservoir (Reid et al., 2004) . It is assumed that these pandemic strains derive by the reassortment of strains of avian origin with strains that propagate in humans. These reassortants most likely deriveupon the coinfection of a mammal, possibly swine, which permit the growth of both avian and human influenza strains.",

The data indicate that avian subtypes containing HAs H5 and H7 are highly pathogenic in domestic fowl.

Avian influenza subtypes bearing HAs H5 and H7 demonstrate direct transfer and replication in humans, yet currently are limited in secondary spread within the human population.

It displayed the characteristic receptor-binding domain embedded in a globular head and a membrane proximal domain containing the signature alpha helical stalk and HA1/HA2 cleavage site, which is a major contributor to its pathogenesis. Superimposition studies of HA domains from this Vietnamese isolate with those of human, swine, and avian viruses demonstrated that its was most closely related to the H1 HA, reconstructed from the virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic (Stevens et al., 2006) . Molecular studies demonstrate that influenza viruses switch from avian to mammalian receptor specificity, by the substitution of one or two amino acids in the receptor-binding region of the HA. This was established for the conversion of avian HAs into the H1, H2, and H3 that caused the twentieth-century human pandemics, and H1 in swine and H3 in horses and seals responsible for recent epizootic disease (Rogers et al., 1983; Connor et al., 1994; Matrosovitch et al., 2000; Nobusawa et al., 2000) . Mutational analysis of the Vietnamese H5N1 isolate indicates that the replacement of individual amino acids in the receptor-binding domain modulates the avian alpha 2,3 sialic acid receptor selectivity (Stevens et al., 2006) . However, the introduction of two amino acid substitutions into the receptorbinding region of the progenitor duck avian influenza virus reduced binding to 2,3 sialic acid but retained binding of 2,6 sialic acid equivalent to the human virus control (Harvey et al., 2004) . These studies imply that in the future the substitution of a small number of appropriate amino acids in the receptor-binding domain of HA could alter the avian/human receptor selectivity of the H5N1 virus and facilitate its efficient human transmission.",

            "text": "shown large-scale transmission into wild waterfowl populations . The ecology of this phenomenon is complex. It appears that some species, such as ducks, transmit highly pathogenic H5N1 strains without disease symptoms. This indicates that migratory aquatic birds could be responsible for the distribution of H5N1 throughout south-east Asia and its ongoing global spread. Furthermore, the lethal infection of wild waterfowl could result in selective pressures within these populations that destabilize their reservoirs of influenza strains. The 15 subtypes of HA (H1-H15) and 9 subtypes of NA (N1-N9) identified in shorebirds, waterfowl, and gulls (Hinshaw et al., 1980) could diversify their sequences and hasten the establishment of new strains that infect domestic poultry and humans. 3. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strains from domestic fowl have shown direct transmission to and lethal infection of humans. However, to date, they are unable to affect secondary transmission between humans. The coinfection of humans or swine with both avian and human influenza viruses could result in a reassortant virus that transmits efficiently between humans. The pandemic reassortant virus will display the avian HA and transmit between humans, and its lethality in humans will depend on the final composition of its avian and human genomic segments. Alternatively, the direct adaptation of a pathogenic avian strain during the infection of humans could result in a variant comprising exclusively avian genomic segments, which efficiently transmits between humans. If this variant is derived by minimal sequence alterations, it may retain its high lethality in humans. Moreover, the adaptation of an avian virus comprising exclusively avian genomic segments that transmits efficiently in humans raises the possibility that this strain may cocirculate between and within the human and bird populations. Such a variant would dramatically enhance the transmission characteristics of infection in both the bird and human populations and make the task of local containment and control of the global spread of pandemic disease more difficult. The probability of the adaptation in humans of an avian strain with these lethality and transmission characteristics is not known but should not be discounted. Our knowledge of the ecology and epidemiologic development of influenza is rudimentary. Few influenza authorities would have anticipated the unprecedented emergence and global spread of a highly pathogenic avian influenza strain from domestic poultry that induced lethal disease by the direct infection of humans and wild waterfowl in 1996.",

Despite the value they represent to society, vaccines only comprise 2% of the total global pharmaceutical market (Rappuoli et al., 2002) . The main reason for this paradox is financial in that successful vaccines provide a low return on investment because they progressively eliminate disease and ultimately erode their own market. Influenza is an exception in that vaccines against epidemic disease induce protective immunity against the surface HA of circulating variants. New genetic influenza variants are not recognized by the protective antibodies in the human population and require the annual development of new vaccines to control epidemic disease. Pandemics are initiated in humans by the introduction of an influenza subtype that displays a novel HA, which transmits infection to naive members of the population. The control of pandemics is difficult because disease outbreak in the population must occur before the causative strain can be identified and the isolate made available for manufacturers to initiate vaccine development. Thereafter, it is a race to produce sufficient vaccine to protect the population before the highly contagious acute disease spreads globally and achieves peak infection rates. In contrast, genetic variants of the pandemic strain circulate in the human population causing annual epidemics. These strains are identified by surveillance and the candidates selected early in the spring, allowing time for vaccine production for the coming winter influenza season.",

Due to the lack of human-to-human transmission of H5N1, large-scale vaccine production was postponed and only the early stages of vaccine development were undertaken. Yet, to produce the first samples of vaccine for small-scale clinical evaluation it took 7 months, much longer than in alerts in 1957, 1968, and 1976 . A reason for this delay was that the pathogenicity of the H5N1 isolate in humans required the stringent use of biological containment facilities (BSL 3+) to manipulate the viral isolates. In addition, the lethality of H5N1 virus in embryonated eggs required the application of reverse genetics to produce an attenuated surrogate to produce vaccine virus in eggs (Wood, 2001) .",

In contrast, in the current H5N1 pandemic alert, the entire global population is immunologically naive to the HA H5 in the new subtype. Immunity against the NA N1 may reduce disease severity and exhibit a biphasic distribution in the human population represented by two distinct age groups. These populations include individuals over 50 years of age who were infected by H1N1 before its disappearance from circulation in humans in 1957 and young adults under 29 years of age infected by H1N1 which inexplicably resumed circulation in 1977.",

Both groups advocate a combination of quarantine (social distancing) and antiviral therapy using oseltamivir to treat infected individuals and as a prophylactic for healthy contacts and the local population. Longini et al. also suggest using a poorly matched H5N1 vaccine if it is available. The modeling data suggest that if the exercise is started within weeks of the first transmissible infection and the disease spread is relatively slow, it would be possible within their programming parameters to contain the spread of the pandemic variant. This computer-based outcome relies on the early identification of a single outbreak epicenter in rural Thailand, the rapid and coordinated delivery of antivirals and vaccine, the staff to implement medical treatment and enforce quarantine, and the cooperation of the local indigenous population. It also assumes the efficacy of antiviral treatment of infections caused by the highly genetically variable influenza viruses and does not take into account that resistance to this antiviral has been detected in certain H5N1 infections of humans in southeast Asia (Le et al., 2005) . These modeling data are encouraging and suggest that under ideal circumstances this approach may contain an emerging pandemic or at least delay its spread, and thus increase the time available for the production of an effective vaccine. Yet from a practical point of view, a disease spreading with predetermined characteristics and constraints within the confines of a computer program is far removed from the reality of its dissemination in the tropical rural communities of an impoverished southeast Asian country.",

This seems peculiar when confronted by the global spread of an avian strain H5N1 which exhibits unprecedented lethal infections of humans (Writing Committee of the World Health Organization Consultation on Human Influenza A/H5, 2005).

The derivation of an influenza vaccine that induces cross-protective immunity against all viral subtypes that infect humans would yield a universal vaccine impervious to variations in the surface glycoproteins HA and NA. The ideal cross-protective vaccine would induce long-lived immunity against all subtypes of human influenza virus and avian subtypes that infect humans, and thereby eliminate epidemic and pandemic diseases.

The M2 protein is a homotetramer composed of two disulfidelinked dimers that assemble across the cell membrane to form a proton-selective ion channel (Sugrue & Hay, 1991) . Sequencing studies show that M2 protein is highly conserved and that the extracellular domain shows very little change in all human viruses sequenced since the first human virus was isolated in 1933 (Ito et al., 1991; Fiers et al., 2004) . The M2 protein is present in low concentration on the virion surface but is abundantly represented on the surface of influenza-infected cells (Lamb et al., 1985; Zebedee & Lamb, 1988) . M2 mediates proton influx into endosomes which results in the dissociation of the viral ribonucleoprotein from the matrix protein facilitating the replication of viral RNA (Helenius, 1992) . Consistent with this role in viral multiplication, a monoclonal antibody that attaches to the M2 extracellular domain inhibits viral replication in cell culture and in infected mice (Zebedee & Lamb, 1988; Treanor et al., 1990) .",

These data were confirmed and it was demonstrated that cross-protective immunity could be induced by the 24 highly conserved amino acids of the extracellular domain of M2 when presented in soluble fusion proteins and virus-like particles (Nierynck et al., 1999; Mozdzanowska et al., 2003; Fan et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004; Ionescu et al., 2006) .

It was shown that these M2 recombinant proteins induced cross-protective antibodies in rodents, ferrets and rhesus monkeys. Moreover, conserved sequences have been identified from other influenza proteins including HA, nucleoprotein, and matrix proteins that induce cross-protective immunity in rodents (Levi & Arnon, 1996; Epstein et al., 2002) .",

Those sequences shown individually to induce immunity would be assembled into a multivalent recombinant protein. The arrangement and number of individual epitopes within the recombinant protein can be adjusted to assure the optimal induction of robust cross-protective immunity against all human viral subtypes and those avian subtypes that infect humans. These recombinant proteins can be prepared as stable soluble products or virus-like particles in bacterial or insect expression systems and formulated with appropriate adjuvants for clinical evaluation in humans. A successful clinical outcome would lead to an affordable subunit vaccine for administration to children within the pediatric schedule, which, with appropriate boosting, would confer lifelong immunity against influenza infection. Ideally, a successful universal influenza vaccine would eliminate both epidemic and pandemic diseases and the associated mortality and socioeconomic burdens.",

The infection of humans by the avian subtype H5N1 causes severe disease that is highly lethal but it is currently limited by the lack of transmission between humans. A variant of this highly pathogenic strain that transmits efficiently between humans would result in the global spread of this highly contagious infection that could rapidly overwhelm medical and societal infrastructures and lead to widespread deaths and political and social unrest. The threat posed by influenza infections to human society transcends that of most infectious diseases and dwarfs natural disasters and terrorist threats. The recent changes in influenza evolution and transmission calls for a global initiative to develop more effective vaccines that produce broad cross-protective immunity and eliminate epidemic and pandemic diseases in humans.",
