On a note, there are also genes essential for the progression of autophagy that are not called ATG.AutophagosomesThey are vesicles with a double lipid bilayer, which are formed during macroautophagy. Autophagosomes sequester and deliver cytoplasmic material into the lysosomes for degradation.AutophagyAn evolutionary conserved lysosomal degradative pathway. The term encompasses 3 processes: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Basal autophagy constantly recycles the cytoplasmic components and thereby maintains the cellular homeostasis. When cells are exposed to stress, the enhancement of autophagy contributes to overcome them.Autophagy receptorsAutophagic receptors are a set of proteins that simultaneously bind specifically a structure targeted by autophagy and ATG proteins found in the interior of autophagosomes, mainly LC3. This property provide the substrate specificity to the selective types of autophagy.PASThe Phagophore Assembly Site or Pre-Autophagosomal Structure is the nucleation site where the ATG proteins assemble to first generate a phagophore and subsequently expand it into an autophagosome. In yeast there is one PAS per cell whereas in mammalian cells there are several per cell.Phagophore (also known as isolation membrane)The phagophore is a membrane cistern that is the precursor structure of the autophagosomes. It is formed at the PAS by the orchestrated actions of the ATG proteins, which also elongate it into an autophagosome.Selective autophagyThis term describes forms of macroautophagy in which a specific structure (i.e. an aggregate, organelle, or microbe) is specifically and exclusively sequestered by autophagosomes.\n",

            "text": "Autophagosomes were first described by the Nobel laureate Christian de Duve in 1966 (De Duve and Wattiaux, 1966). One of the peculiarities of these carriers in comparison to other transport vesicles is their double lipid bilayer, which has also a low content in transmembrane proteins. Therefore, autophagosomes appear as very smooth vesicles when analyzed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy (Fengsrud et al., 2000). Their size can vary from 500 nm up to 1.5 \u00b5m and this flexibility allow them to sequester cargoes of different sizes (Fengsrud et al., 2000, Klionsky et al., 2012, Mizushima et al., 2002). In contrast to other transport vesicles, an autophagosome is formed de novo, that is, not through budding from a pre-existing organelle, and it sequesters cytoplasmic cargo material during its completion. This different solution adopted by the cell to generate a vesicle is probably due to the topology of the cargo, which is cytoplasmic, and therefore cannot be engulfed by a single lipid bilayer with exposed extremities, something thermodynamically highly unfavorable (Reggiori and Klionsky, 2013).",

In particular the genes mediating the process of autophagy were identified through genetic screens in this organism and they are currently called the AuTophaGy-related (ATG) genes. This discovery was the breakthrough in the autophagy research because the high degree of conservation of numerous ATG genes allowed identifying their counterparts in high eukaryotes. To date 36 ATG genes have been characterized in yeast and many of them have human orthologs (Klionsky et al., 2003, Yang and Klionsky, 2010). In high eukaryotes there are additional genes essential for autophagy that are not called ATG. It is now established that the generation of autophagosomes is regulated by a hierarchical interplay of the ATG proteins and it is divided in 3 discrete steps: (1) initiation, (2) nucleation, and (3) elongation and closure.",

            "text": "Initiation of autophagy is mediated by the ULK/ATG1 complex. The mammalian ULK kinase complex is composed of ULK1/2 (unc-51-like kinase), FIP200 (focal adhesion kinase family interacting protein of 200 kD), ATG13, and ATG101. The ULK/ATG1 complex is differentially regulated by TORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), and possibly by other signaling cascades. In particular, active TORC1 inhibits the ULK/ATG1 complex whereas active AMPK stimulates the ULK/ATG1 complex (He and Klionsky, 2009, Yang and Klionsky, 2010). TORC1, with its central serine/threonine kinase mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), acts as a nutrient sensor in the cell and is activated in presence of nutrients. Under these conditions, through phosphorylation, TORC1 inhibits both AMPK and the ULK/ATG1 complex, to which it is bound. In nutrient-deprived cells, in contrast, AMPK is activated and phosphorylates TORC1 leading to its inhibition and dissociation from the ULK/ATG1 complex. In addition, AMPK phosphorylates the ULK/ATG1 complex and thereby activates it. The activation by AMPK and simultaneously release of inhibition by the TORC1 stimulates the ULK/ATG1 complex kinase activity initiating the autophagic process (He and Klionsky, 2009, Yang and Klionsky, 2010).",

            "text": "After the initiation step, the ATG proteins assemble at cellular structures that has been called the phagophore assembly site or pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS). In mammalian cells numerous early autophagosomal structures can be observed upon autophagy induction whereas only one PAS is generated in yeast. The assembly of the ATG proteins, called nucleation, requires the local generation of the phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). PdtIns3P is generated by the PtdIns3 kinase class 3 (PtdIns3KC3), also called hVPS34. This protein is in complex with the regulatory factors BECLIN1/ATG6 and p150 (human VPS15), which together compose the PtdIns3KC3 complex (Simonsen and Tooze, 2009). The insertion of BECLIN1 into the PtdIns3KC3 complex is negatively regulated by BCL-2 protein family members and positively stimulated by the ULK complex (Russell et al., 2013, Pattingre et al., 2005). The PtdIns3KC3 complex fulfils several functions in autophagy and in endosomal vesicle transport pathways depending on which proteins are associated with the complex. Binding of ATG14L (or Barkor) and AMBRA1 (activating molecule in BECLIN1-regulated autophagy) to the PtdIns3KC3 complex recruits the complex to the PAS stimulating autophagosome formation (Kang et al., 2011). When this complex is associated with UVRAG (ultraviolet irradiation resistant-associated gene), which is in turn bind to BIF-1 (Bax-interacting factor 1), it is engaged in autophagosome maturation as well as endocytific trafficking (Kang et al., 2011). However, when UVRAG is interacting with RUBICON (RUN domain and cysteine-rich domain containing, BECLIN1-interacting protein), autophagosome maturation is blocked (He and Klionsky, 2009, Kang et al., 2011).",

It is also clear that this lipid mediates the recruitment of PtdIns3P-binding proteins (also called PtdIns3P effector proteins) that are necessary for autophagosome biogenesis to the PAS (Mari et al., 2011, Isakson et al., 2013, Codogno et al., 2012). Several of these PdtIns3P effector proteins are known that are involved in autophagosomal formation, including ALFY, DFCP1, and WIPI protein family members (homologs to the yeast ATG18). It was shown in yeast that ATG18 localization to the PAS depends on its interaction with ATG2 and the presence of PtdIns3P (Obara et al., 2008, Rieter et al., 2013). The ATG18-ATG2 complex interacts with ATG9, the only transmembrane ATG protein, at the PAS (Reggiori et al., 2004). ATG9 thereby at least partially contributes membranes to the forming phagophore even if its interaction with the forming autophagosomes is very dynamic in both yeast and mammalian cells (Mari et al., 2011, Isakson et al., 2013, Codogno et al., 2012, Chan and Tang, 2013, Orsi et al., 2012, Yamamoto et al., 2012).",

The formation of the ATG16L1 complex as well as the LC3 lipidation are essential for the autophagosome biogenesis. The ATG16L1 complex contains the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate. The formation of this complex is mediated by the E1-like enzyme ATG7, which activates ATG12 and transfers it to ATG10, an E2-like enzyme, which finally covalently binds ATG12 to ATG5. The ATG12-ATG5 conjugate interact with ATG16L1 to form a multimeric complex, the ATG16L1 complex, which localizes to the phagophore and early autophagosome intermediates but dissociates from complete autophagosomes (Ohsumi and Mizushima, 2004, Yang and Klionsky, 2010).",

            "text": "In the second conjugation system, LC3 becomes linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Initially a preform of LC3 is posttranslationally cleaved at the C-terminus by the ATG4 proteases. The resulting cytoplasmic form of LC3, also called LC3-I, gets also activated by the E1-like enzyme ATG7 and transferred onto ATG3, another E2-like enzyme before being conjugated to PE. The ATG16L1 complex promotes this latter step by specifically bringing ATG8-ATG3 in proximity of the PE pool present in the autophagosomal membranes. The LC3-PE conjugate, also known as LC3-II, is present in the inner as well as at the outer surface of the expanding autophagosomal membrane. Prior to the autophagosome fusion with lysosomes, the LC3-II pool on the outer autophagosomal membrane is released from PE by ATG4 for reuse (Kabeya et al., 2000, Yang and Klionsky, 2010, He and Klionsky, 2009). The fact that a subpopulation of LC3 is present in the interior of autophagosomes makes this protein the ideal marker to monitor the generation of these carriers and their subsequent fusion with lysosomes (Kabeya et al., 2000). In particular LC3 subcellular distribution can be analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and the redistribution of this protein from the cytoplasm into punctuate structures, for example, the autophagosomes, is an indicator of autophagy induction. Furthermore it allows assessing autophagy induction and progression by analyzing the LC3-II protein levels by Western blot (Klionsky et al., 2012, Mizushima, 2004, Rubinsztein et al., 2009).",

            "text": "While enormous progresses have been done regarding the characterization of the ATG machinery, the origin of the autophagosomal membranes is still not clear. Membranes from multiple sources have been shown to contribute to the formation and maturation of autophagosomes; therefore, this topic is the subject of intense debate and research. Amongst these there are several organelles, including the plasma membrane (Ravikumar et al., 2010), early endosomes (Razi et al., 2009), the mitochondria (Hailey et al., 2010), recycling endosomes (Longatti and Tooze, 2012, Puri et al., 2013), the Golgi complex (Mari et al., 2011, Orsi et al., 2010) and the ER (Axe et al., 2008, Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009, Yla-Anttila et al., 2009a; Figure 1). In fact, it was shown that most of the autophagosomes form in close association with the ER, in a structure called the omegasome (Axe et al., 2008, Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009, Yla-Anttila et al., 2009a). The omegasome is a PtdIns3P rich subdomain of the ER that is formed upon starvation. It is a dynamic structure where ATG proteins required for the nucleation step assemble and which gives rise to phagophores and then autophagosomes (Axe et al., 2008, Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009, Yla-Anttila et al., 2009a). The autophagosomes, however, do not bud or form directly from the ER but rather originate in close proximity of this organelle, possibly in regions that most likely are in close contact with mitochondrial membranes, that is, the so-called mitochondria-associated membranes (Hamasaki et al., 2013).",

Amphisomes ultimately fuse with lysosomes too. These events lead to progressive maturation of autophagosomes into a degradative compartment, the autolysosome, through the acquisition of low pH and lysosomal hydrolases, which access the autophagosomal cargo and mediate its turnover (He and Klionsky, 2009; Figure 1). The precise mechanism of how the autophagosome fuses with the lysosomes has not yet been fully resolved. However, members of both the Rab GTPase and the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor) protein families as well as a low intralysosomal pH have been shown to be involved in fusion (Bento et al., 2013, Moreau et al., 2013, Yamamoto et al., 1998). During the autophagosome fusion events, only the outer lipid bilayer of these double-membrane carriers fuses with the lysosomal limiting membrane and as a result the inner autophagosomal vesicle is also degraded within the autolysosome. The resulting material is finally transported by lysosomal membrane permeases out of the autolysosome lumens into the cytoplasm, where it can be metabolized by the cell (He and Klionsky, 2009; Figure 1).",

This is accomplished on the one hand through the active transport of the autophagosomes via microtubules from the cell periphery to the microtubule organization center (MTOC) (Bento et al., 2013). On the other hand, lysosomal positioning within the cell is regulated in a nutrient-dependent manner by mTOR. That is, under growing conditions lysosomes bind to a kinesin complex that mediated their positioning at the cell periphery. Under starvation, an increase in the intracellular pH provokes an inhibition of the recruitment of the kinesin complex to the lysosomal membrane and thereby allowing lysosomes to move to the MTOC (Bento et al., 2013).",

Often the initial phagophore is formed in close proximity to the ER. In addition to this organelle, other cellular compartments such as mitochondria, the plasma membrane, the Golgi complex and recycling endosomes have been postulated to contribute membranes to form the phagophore and then expand it into an autophagosome. During the formation of autophagosomes, the cytoplasmic material is sequestered within the forming vesicle. Complete autophagosomes fuse either directly with lysosomes to form autolysosomes or with endosomes to generate an organelle called amphisome. This latter eventually fuse with lysosomes too. In the lysosome lumen, resident hydrolases degrade the autophagosomal cargo and the resulting metabolites are transported back in to the cytoplasm by lysosomal permeases. The autophagosome can also fuse with the plasma membrane and thereby being one of the mechanisms for unconventional secretion.",
