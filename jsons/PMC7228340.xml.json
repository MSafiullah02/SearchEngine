According to the daily report of the World Health Organization, the epidemic of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 so far registered 78 630 cases and 2747 deaths in China, spread to 46 other countries that reported a total of 3664 cases by 27 February 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200227-sitrep-38-covid-19.pdf).

When secondary bacterial infection occurred, medication was administered according to the results of bacterial culture and drug sensitivity.\n33\n Current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have a survival benefit, but rather delayed viral clearance.\n48\n, \n49\n, \n50\n Therefore, routine corticosteroids should be avoided unless they are indicated for other reason. Arbidol is used empirically in China because of its direct antiviral effect on SARS\u2010CoV in cell culture.\n51\n Chinese herbal medicine formulae are used to prevent SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in 23 provinces in China.\n52\n\n",

At the moment, there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for COVID\u201019. The best strategy to deal with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 epidemic includes controlling the sources of infection, protecting the susceptible people, and cutting off the transmission. The infected patients should be identified early by rapid and robust detection technologies, provided with optimized treatment in isolation timely. The close contact people should be quarantined with follow\u2010up. The healthy people should be aware of the severity of COVID\u201019 and take measures to protect themselves, such as staying at home, limiting social contacts, and wearing protective mask in public. The authorities should encourage people to stay at home; discourage mass gathering; postpone or cancel public events; and close public institutions. These control measures will help COVID\u201019 infected countries to prevent the epidemic effectively. Future research will focus on improving the accuracy of early diagnostic tests, developing the vaccine and identifying effective drugs. Therefore, elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is imperative for achieving such goals.",
