Several microbes have been implicated as etiological agents of PEMS (Edens et al., 1998; Yu et al., 2000) . PEMS occurs during the second and third weeks after hatching and is characterized by initial vocalization from the poults, feed refusal, diarrhea, weight loss, immune dysfunction, and a mortality rate of 20 to 50% (Barnes and Guy, 1997; Qureshi et al., 1997) .

The recovery Ab titer for controls was 10.7, significantly higher than restricted feed (8.71) and RE (8.10) groups but not different from other treatments. The primary total Ab responses to BA were significantly lower in the restricted feed and RE groups as compared with the control and other treatments.

Usually, there is little or no body weight gain during the 8-to 13-d course of the active disease. Average feed intake is sufficient only to maintain body weight (K. Krueger, 1997, Diamond K, Marshville, NC, personal communication) . PEMS survivors have stunted growth and are not capable of complete compensatory growth based on the definition of accelerated growth (Odetallah et al., 2001) . Consequently, among PEMS survivors, there is great variation in BW at market age. The high mortality associated with PEMS may be attributed primarily to dehydration and hypothermia from lack of dietary electrolytes, water, and energy. Studies with human infants, calves, and piglets afflicted with acute enteric disease have shown that mortality can be reduced significantly by oral administration of physiologically balanced solu-Abbreviation Key: Ab = antibody; BA = Bacillus abortus; PEMS = poult enteritis mortality syndrome; PEP = poultry electrolyte preparation; RE = feed restricted + electrolytes; REGC = feed restricted + electrolytes + glucose + citric acid; REGCB = feed restricted + electrolytes + glucose + citric acid + betaine; REGCBZ = feed restricted + electrolytes + glucose + citric acid + betaine + zinc methionine; R = feed restricted + water. tions of water, electrolytes, and glucose (Hirschhorn, 1982; Wilson et al., 1990) .

The poults consumed a nutritionally complete turkey starter diet (Table 1) and water ad libitum. During the first 5 d of age, the poults were given a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (30 mg/L) in drinking water to eliminate potential enteric pathogens (e.g., Salmonella). Preliminary experiments revealed that feed restriction increased the susceptibility of poults to latent opportunistic bacterial infection, such as salmonellosis (unpublished data). At 10 d of age the poults were weighed individually and randomly assigned to their respective treatment groups. The poults were weighed again at 15 d of age when the 2-wk treatment period began.",

This suppression in humoral immune response was significantly alleviated when the restricted poults consumed drinking water supplemented with electrolytes and energy sources of glucose and citric acid. The additional energy intake was sufficient to produce a slight increase in body weight gain of about 5 g/poult per day. Such positive response might be explained by the increased intake of energy (primarily glucose) via the drinking water. This additional energy appears to have spared dietary protein (i.e., increased the efficiency of utilization of dietary protein for growth). Increased consumption of fluids containing glucose appeared to be an attempt of the growth-stunted poults to fulfill their needs for energy. Kaunitz et al. (1995) and Nappert et al. (2000) reported that a glucose-based solution stimulates intestinal absorption of electrolytes from isotonic luminal contents. This finding suggests that the use of PEP, containing glucose and citric acid, may restore solute and volume deficits that result from diarrhea and provide energy to anorexic birds. Similarly, Hirschhorn (1982) reported that treatment with an oral rehydration solution containing electrolytes and glucose alleviates anorexia and stimulates food intake in human infants with diarrhea.",

When they begin to consume feed again, the high demand for phosphate to phosphorylate the incoming glucose reduces the blood inorganic phosphate to fatally low levels (Ferket, 1995) . Edens and Doerfler (1997a,b) also reported that glucose metabolism in PEMS-infected poults appears to be impaired because hepatic glycogen is depleted, and hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity is increased without concomitant increases in serum glucose. Even with addition of sucrose to the drinking water of infected poults, these conditions were not corrected (Edens and Doerfler, 1997a) . It is important to point out here that poults used in this study did not have PEMS. Therefore, the former consequences may not apply to our feed restriction model in which poults were restricted in feed to maintenance in order to simulate the situation observed in PEMS reported by K. Krueger (1999, personal communication) .",

They found that the immune response is compromised by malnutrition but can recover if sufficient energy and electrolytes are supplied via drinking water. Nathan et al. (1977) reported that antibody response in chicks fasted for 24 or 48 h are impaired. In a comprehensive literature review, Chandra (1994) described immune dysfunctions in infants with protein-energy malnutrition. In the malnourished humans (Ozkan, 1993) , nutrient deficiencies altered either cellular or humoral immune mechanisms and increased the susceptibility to bronchopneumonia and gastroenteritis infections. Klasing (1998) proposed that a threshold nutrient sufficiency is required for the initial development of the immune response so that responding cells can divide and synthesize effector molecules. Our results support this hypothesis and demonstrate that additional energy, sufficient to increase body weight gain by 5 g/poult per day, significantly enhanced the humoral immune response. Electrolytes alone had a modest although significant effect on stimulating the humoral immune response to SRBC without affecting the body weight gain.",

The lack of response to betaine may be due to the fact that its osmorugulating properties were not needed in this feed restriction situation. This assumption is supported by several experimental findings. For example, renal cells have an active sodium-dependent betaine transport that increases in activity under osmotic stress in vitro (Nakanishi et al., 1990) . Furthermore, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells accumulate betaine and other osmolytes when cultured in hypertonic medium (Nakanishi et al., 1988 (Nakanishi et al., , 1990 . In infectious diarrheal conditions caused by bacteria (e.g., Clostridium, Escherichia, or Salmonella) and viruses (e.g., adenovirus, coronavirus, or rotavirus) adenylate cyclase, and cAMP activities are increased and stimulate crypt cell secretory activity and decrease villous absorption of sodium chloride (Fondacaro, 1986) leading to hyperosmolar medium in the intestinal lumen (Cantey, 1993) . Such hyperosmolar environment may not be present in our noninfected, feed-restricted poults.",

The use of an electrolyte solution alone had a modest effect on T-cell-dependent antibody production.
