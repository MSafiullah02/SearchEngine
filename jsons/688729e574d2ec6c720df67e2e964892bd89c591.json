COVID-19 most commonly present with influenza-like illness (ILI). 7 While China was facing COVID-19 outbreak, European countries were struggling with seasonal influenza. 8 Clinical symptomatology between COVID-19 and ILIis similar,we therefore decided retrospectively to look for SARS-COV2 in respiratory samples collected in the intensive care units (ICUs) of our hospital near Paris.",

His last trip was in Algeria during August 2019. One of his child presented with ILI prior to the onset of his symptoms. His medical history consisted in asthma, type II diabetes mellitus. He presented to the emergency ward on December 27 2019 with hemoptysis, cough, headache and fever, evolving for 4 days. Initial examination was unremarkable and the performed CT scan revealed bilateral ground glass opacity in inferior lobes (Figure 3 ). at admission he had a lymphopenia, an elevated C-Reactive Protein and fibrinogen while Pro Calcitonin was in normal range value.

Identifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 and its spreading in the country. Moreover, the absence of a link with China and the lack of recent travel suggest that the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December, 2019.",

COVID-19 is considered to be responsible for 86334 cases and 12210 deaths as of April 10, 2020 4 in France, but our findings suggest that these numbers could be underestimating the actual burden of COVID-19. Two recent studies suggested that around 18 to 23% infected with SARS-COV-2 were asymptomatic 16 and that around 55% of infected were caused by unidentified infected persons. 17 Our results strongly support these two assumptions, suggesting that many asymptomatic patients were not diagnosed during January 2020 and contributed to the spread of this epidemic.",

Firstly, due to the retrospective nature of the analyses carried out, medical records were not exhaustive and some relevant information might have been missing. Secondly, we are not able to rule out false negative results due to the sensitivity of RT-PCR 19 and a technique of storage that possibly damage the quality of the samples. 20 To avoid any false positive result we have taken all the usual precautions and we also confirmed it by two different, techniques and staff. Thirdly we restricted our analyses to only a few samples and we chose to limit the selected records to ICU patients with compatible symptoms and CT, even though most patients actually have mild symptoms. Fourthly, we restricted our analyses to patients with a negative multiplex PCR at the time even though cross contamination has been described in literature. 9 Finally, we conducted a monocentric study in the Northern Paris area, which faced a particularly high burden in this epidemic. 21 These limitations could explain why we were only able to identify one person infected with SARS-COV-2, in our population.",
