To date, neither the highly pathogenic H5N2 nor the emerging H7N2 viruses in the USA have been shown to be pathogenic for human beings. Notwithstanding, ongoing surveillance provides information on the role of these markets in the continuing evolution of H7N2 viruses with pathogenic potential for poultry,6 and the difficulty or seemingly impossible task of eliminating H7N2 influenza viruses from markets, despite many attempts. Additionally in New York the number of live-poultry markets nearly doubled from 44 in 1994 to over 80 in 2002.7 Surveillance in live-poultry markets in the USA serves as an early-warning system of emerging influenza viruses that are a threat to the poultry industry and potentially to human beings.",

            "text": "The H5N1 bird-influenza incident in Hong Kong in 1997 left no doubt about the role of live-poultry markets as a source of novel infectious disease agents for human beings. Live-poultry markets were identified as a risk factor for H5N1 influenza,8 and slaughter of all poultry in Hong Kong brought the outbreak in human beings to a stop. To reduce the possibility of re-emergence of H5N1, changes were made in poultry markets in Hong Kong: after 1997 all aquatic birds, including ducks and geese (the original source of influenza viruses), were eliminated from the markets and sold chilled, and a representative sample of each truckload of poultry entering Hong Kong is screened to assess the level of H5N1 immunity. Despite these changes highly pathogenic H5N1 of multiple new genotypes reappeared in retail poultry markets in 2001, and all poultry were again destroyed to prevent transmission to human beings.9 Marketing practices were also changed to reduce the risk from influenza virus, including removal of quail (a newly recognised host susceptible to all subtypes of influenza and a potential intermediate host10, 11) and the introduction of a clean day every month when all markets are emptied simultaneously and cleaned. Despite these additional changes H5N1 viruses reappeared in late 2002 and in early 2003 in the live-bird markets, in wild migrating birds, and on farms, and killed many aquatic birds in Kowloon and Penfold parks in Hong Kong. In February, 2003, H5N1 virus was again transmitted to human beings and killed two infected persons in a family of four, and WHO issued a pandemic alert.12 The reappearance of H5N1 in human beings coincided with the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and caused initial confusion in the diagnosis of the causative agent of SARS.",

In Hong Kong, since 2000, the influenza subtypes have been limited to H6N1 and H9N2, with intermittent introductions of H5N1. By contrast, multiple different subtypes (H1N1, H2N9, H3N2, H3N3, H3N6, and H4N6) continue to circulate in live-poultry markets in mainland China.13 The use of inactivated H5N1 vaccines and improved sanitation on farms in Hong Kong hold promise for reducing the introduction of H5N1 from the farms. A similar policy of vaccination is being used on farms in the Mainland that provide live poultry to Hong Kong, again holding the promise of reducing the possibility of introduction of H5N1 virus. The transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 to wild migrating birds in Hong Kong in 2003 and the unknown distribution of these H5N1 viruses in mainland China is a worry. Introduction of a standardised H5N1 influenza vaccine for use on poultry farms in China could further improve vaccine strategy.",

Yi Guan and colleagues14 recently established a potential zoonotic origin of SARS coronavirus (CoV) and wet markets as a possible source of the original outbreak. These researchers isolated a novel coronavirus from Himalayan palm civets (Paguna larvata) found in live-animal markets in Guangdong and provided serological evidence of infection of other animals (raccoon dogs, Nyctereutes procuyoinboides) and human beings in the markets. The animal isolates were different from the human SARS CoV in that they had an additional 29-nucleotide sequence not found in the human isolates (figure 2\n). WHO has had a task force working with Chinese authorities to develop strategies to define the ecology of SARS CoV. At the October, 2003, meeting Options to Control Influenza, in Okinawa, Japan, reports of replication of SARS CoV with disease signs in primates,15 ferrets and cats,16 and mice17 provide animal models for vaccine and antiviral development, but suggest a wider host range in nature. After the identification of SARS-like CoV in civet cats,14 civets were banned from wet markets in China but are again now available. Customer demand has driven the price for civet cats up to US$200, making it likely that such animals could be obtained whether or not they were banned. We lack information on the transmissibility of the SARS CoV-like virus in animals, the mode of transmission (oral, faecal), the role of intermediate hosts (eg, pigs and quail for influenza), environmental stability, and serological screening at the human-animal interface.",

Such closure would put thousands of legitimate owners and workers in wet markets out of business, with all the legal issues to be resolved. Continuing demand and high prices would drive the wet-market system underground where monitoring would be impossible. Currently, wet markets serve as an early-warning system for H5N1 influenza in Asia and H7N2 in the USA, and will likely serve the same role for SARS CoV. The immediate goal must be to reduce the virus burden in wet markets, and perhaps the first use of pandemic vaccines should be on farms raising animals for wet markets. Additionally, hygiene and sanitation can be improved immediately, and modified as we understand the ecology of these viruses. Selling of wild-caught animals should be discouraged by education of customers and stall owners about the health risks.",

The case in point is SARS\u2014there are no red-meat wet markets in Hong Kong but that did not prevent SARS appearing in Hong Kong. Additionally the local early-warning system for influenza would potentially be compromised. The situation with H5N1 influenza is complex, because declaration of its presence would negatively affect poultry exports.

Laboratory regulations globally are inconsistent. We now live in a global village, so universal guidelines need to be adopted. The situation with H2N2 influenza is a case in point. Although H2N2 influenza has not circulated in human beings since 1968 and everyone under the age of 36years is susceptible, the H2N2 virus is widely distributed in laboratories and is still used in some laboratories. The re-emergence of H1N1 influenza, in 1977, that continues to circulate in human beings is another unresolved case. This H1N1 virus remained genetically conserved for 27 years.24 The most likely explanation is that the virus came from a frozen source and a laboratory seems the most probable culprit.
