However, mortality figures give only a partial measure of the toll asked by infectious diseases, and the global burden includes also health impact measured by disabilities, deformities, loss of productivity, care and treatment caused by a multitude of diseases like lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, sleeping sickness and others. The impact of infectious diseases can be traced according to economic performance of African countries, showing that 34 out of 53 countries are classified as lowincome economies. The disease burden is, however, more devastating since it affects all components of human development, including income, health and education. The impact of infectious diseases on African countries is no longer a crisis only for the healthcare sector, but presents a challenge to all sectors. It has the potential to reverse those gains made in human development in the last few years. Consequently, beyond health issues, these diseases should and must globally be seen as a development concern, affecting education and knowledge acquisition, income and social status, productivity and economic growth and other direct and indirect components of human development such as gender equality and human rights.",

Well known existing, emerging and re-emerging diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, cholera, meningitis, hepatitis, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, sleeping sickness, Ebola, SARS and others are causing suffering and mortality to a wide population in developing countries in general, and in Africa in particular (WHO, 2003a) . Beyond mortality statistics, different methods can be considered to quantify the burden of disease expressed in terms of socio-economic costs such as productivity losses, care and treatment, hospitalization and handicap. In order to overcome the specific problems of each country, the most used method is the approach that measures the global burden of disease in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) which is a combination of Years of Life Lost (YLL) through premature death, and Years Lived with Disability (YLD). Thus, DALY is thought of as one lost year of healthy life (Mathers et al., 2007) (> Table 66-1) .",

Considering a broader definition of development that supplement income by other components like levels of health and education, the United Nations have developed five main composite indices to measure the average achievements in basic human development (human development index (HDI)), gender-related development index (GDI), > human poverty indices (HPI-1 and HPI-2) and the gender empowerment measure (GEM). HDI is the most used index giving a summary measure of human development, allowing a yearly comparison between countries around the world and indicating the relative ranking evolution in time of each country. HDI is a three dimensional composite index obtained as a mean of three indicators weighed equally: health (life expectancy at birth), standard of living (GDP per capita) and education (literacy and enrolment) (UNDP, 2006) .",

In Africa, less than 65% of children are enrolled in primary school and thousands of enrolled children will prematurely leave school under the pressure of infectious diseases, including orphans, disabled, impoverished and those who withdraw to look after ill members of their families (UNICEF, 2005; UNAIDS, 2006; UNESCO, 2007 ) (> Table 66 -8) .

More globally, these diseases are seen to have a four-fold impact on education. They affect the cognitive ability of children, the capacity of teachers, the upbringing of families and the efficiency of staff and managers. For instance, HIV prevalence among South African . African countries can make important economic benefits by controlling TB through a sustained DOTS strategy. The ratio between benefit and cost can be greater than 10 teachers reaches 21% among those aged 25-34 and 13% among those aged 35-44, whereas in the Zambian school system, over 60% of teacher absence is due to HIV/AIDS (illness, care for ill family members, family funeral, etc..)

Malaria is responsible for 10% of Africa's disease burden and the current GDP is thought to be 32% lower than it would have been without malaria. Consequently, in Africa, malaria is seen both as a disease of poverty and a cause of poverty. The devastating impact of HIV/AIDS is recognised in the majority of national human development reports as stressed in the South Africa human development report (South Africa, 2003 , the Zimbabwe human development report 2003 (Zimbabwe, 2003) and the Malawi human development report 2005 (Malawi, 2005) . These reports give details of the impact of HIV and AIDS on household welfare, orphaned children, the extended family, educational and health sectors, agricultural production, business and public service delivery. They also stress that HIV/AIDS and its far-reaching consequences mean that the disease is no longer a crisis only for the healthcare sector, but presents a challenge to all sectors. It has the potential to reverse those gains made in human development in the last few years. Economically, 34 African countries belong to the lower-income group, 12 are lowermiddle-income countries, only eight countries are classified as higher-middle-income and no African country has reached the high-income level.",

It was estimated that eight million lives per year could be saved by essential interventions against infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies by 2010, resulting in economic benefits adding up to more than US$360 per year by 2015. In the same spirit, the United Nations (UN) Millennium Summit adopted in 2001 the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by fixing eight goals to be reached in 2015. Preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other infectious diseases is one of the goals. However, mid-way, most African countries, have made little (if any) headway in preventing and controlling infectious diseases like HIV/ AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhea, respiratory disease and a multitude of the so-called neglected diseases. Opposite to that, wars and conflicts are financed at the expenses of disease control as it can be sadly noticed from the amount of US$7 billion that African governments dedicated to military spending in 1999 (Mashelkar, 2005) .

For health strategies to be successful, international solidarity and public-private partnerships are needed to tackle the problems of shortage and lack of treatments, resistance and the need for new drugs, vaccines and diagnostic procedures. In this direction, several programmes have already been launched such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFFATM), Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), The medicines for Malaria Ventures (MMV), the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance), The Human Hookworm Vaccine initiative (HHVI), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), the Drug for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), Stop TB, Roll back Malaria, etc. . .. However, this global strategy is insufficient without the national and local implication. Health decision makers, non governmental organizations (NGOs), research institutions, community groups and individuals must join their efforts in order to attenuate the incidences of specific diseases, control the spread of epidemics and development of complications, and optimise the health management of human and material resources.",

The objective fixed by WHO and its partners to provide 3 million people in developing countries with antiretroviral therapy by the end of 2005 was far to be reached, suggesting that more effort and efficient measures are needed. It is also hoped that combined efforts between donor nations and affected countries will provide the US$2-3 billion per year required to scale up the response against malaria in endemic areas. Similarly, although 16 million patients have been treated so far with the WHOrecommended directly observed therapy strategy (DOTS), yet more than half of those affected by tuberculosis still do not have access to this treatment, especially those living in the Nine African countries the most affected by tuberculosis. However, an indisputable economic benefit is predicted from a sustained DOTS and global plan strategy as indicated by the World Bank report (Laxminarayan et al., 2007) . A recent cost-benefit analysis by WHO showed that achieving the global MDG target in water and sanitation would bring substantial economic gain in both health and other benefits (consequences of reduction in diarrheal episodes): each $1 invested would yield an economic return between $3 and $34 depending on region. The health-related costs avoided would reach $7.3 billion per year, and the annual value of adult working days gained as a result of less illness would be almost $750 million.",
