            "text": "In China, the former Soviet Union\u2013style central economy planning system implemented from 1949 until 1980 had invested more in urban industry development than in rural living condition improvement. This has created multidimensional urban-rural inequalities in social determinants of health. According to the National Health Service Survey 2003, safe drinking water is available to 96% of the population of large cities but to <30% in poor rural areas. Ninety percent of residents in large cities have sanitation toilets, compared with <10% in poor rural areas.1 Although economic reform has lifted millions of people out of extreme poverty in recent decades, the urban-rural income gap has widened, with the rural residents having an annual average per capita disposable income less than a third of urban residents in 2010 (US$898 vs US$2900).2 These inequities are associated with significant differences in prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. As reported by a nationwide collaborative survey in China between 2002-2004, the prevalence of H pylori infection among rural and urban residents was 73.4% vs 65.4% (P < .01).3 A more recent systematic review reported that the mean prevalence of H pylori infection was 66% for rural Chinese populations and 47% for urban Chinese populations.4 Because H pylori infection has been established as the most important carcinogen of upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGIC),5 a huge urban-rural disparity in H pylori infection\u2013related cancers has been reported. For example, in China, although the age of rural populations was significantly younger and the population numbered 149.1 million less than the urban population by the middle of 2015 (611,060,000 vs 760,160,000),6 the numbers of newly diagnosed esophageal and gastric cancer cases in 2015, as estimated by the Chinese National Cancer Registry (CNCR), were 3 and 2 times more among rural than among urban populations (364,100 vs 113,800 and 444,000 vs 235,200, respectively).7 The urban-rural disparities in these H pylori infection\u2013related cancers are significantly larger than that in all cancers combined, which was 213.6 vs 191.5 per 100,000.7 CNCR also estimated that the 5-year relative survival for new cancer cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2005 in rural China was about half that of their urban counterparts for all cancers combined (21.8% vs 39.5%), because of a scarcity of medical resources for early diagnosis and adequate treatment.8 Despite such grave social inequities, specific policy is lacking. Using age-standardized incidence rates by population-based tumor registration, this paper describes the urban-rural disparity in H pylori infection\u2013related cancers in relation to unfair distribution of social determinants of health and examines the hypothesis that a decreasing trend of these cancers is associated with socioeconomic development and urbanization in an endemic region. Our aim is to emphasize the role of socioeconomic development among disadvantaged populations and make it a policy priority.",

Its population was 408,995 in 2012. It is a northern neighbor of Linxian County and a northwestern neighbor of Cixian County. All 3 counties have been noted for endemic rates of esophagogastric cancers.9 Shexian consists of a county town and 580 villages. The economy of the county town relies on employment in the industry of power generating and steel making, agricultural product refinery, food manufacture, and tourism, and the rural population is engaged in growing rice, wheat, persimmon, Chinese prickly ash, and walnut. A quarter of the Shexian population, mainly young or middle-aged villagers, move between the village and the county town doing seasonal jobs. Diet in Shexian consists of a self-made staple foods of rice or steamed buns flavored by dishes of vegetables, pork, or eggs. Physical activities for villagers mean manual labor. But in the county town, people aged 60 or older walk or jog in the morning or evening.",

The registered urban population in 2012 was 2,374,827. Shijiazhuang was not a city before 1953. It used to consist of several dozen villages. Its urbanization began as late as 1953, when it was chosen by the Chinese central government as the capital city of Hebei Province and as one of the cities with development priority during the first national 5-year program (1953-1957). During implementation of the program, the North China Pharmaceutical Corporation, which is the biggest antibiotic factory in Asia, and 5 modern textile plants were established in Shijiazhuang city. In 60 years, its registered urban population increased from 182,188 in 1953 to 2,374,827 in 2012. In 2012 the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of Shijiazhuang city was US$6964.80, ranking 119th among the 150 Chinese cities with a GDP higher than the average of US$6102 out of a total of 293 prefecture-level cities.10\n",

From 2000-2015, more than 100,000 young or middle-aged villagers had migrated from the villages to live and work in the county town. The proportion of urban residents increased from 22.4% (85,000/380,000) to 54.8% (230,000/420,000). In 16 years the urban population increased by 170%, with an annual increase of 10.7%. Because pipe water, flush toilets, and central sewage treatment systems are available in the county town, public hygiene and environmental sanitation are greatly improved.",

Consequently, water conditions for most people living in the mountainous county has been gradually improved: The percentage of people drinking rainwater has been reduced from 80% in the 1970s to 10% in 2010.

Because Shexian County is an endemic area for UGIC, the urban-rural difference in esophagogastric cancer in our study is greater than that reported by a Chinese national analysis in 2012 between 74 urban and 119 rural registries.20 However, the differences in westernization-related cancers are about the same. In the national study the urban-rural difference in colorectal cancer was 23.8 vs 16.1 in men and 17.1 vs 11.6 in women, and our results was 22.7 vs 11.8 in men and 15.0 vs 9.3 in women; the national urban-rural difference for female breast cancer was 36.5 vs 23.1; our results was 45.3 vs 14.4. Our finding is also indirectly supported by the most recent national annual cancer incidence analysis, including 255 cancer registries covering 226,494,490 populations for 2013. In the analysis a significantly negative correlation was found between ASR and urbanization rate (the proportion of nonagricultural population) in both sexes for stomach, esophagus, and liver cancers and in women for cervix cancer, but a significant positive correlation was found in both sexes for colorectal cancer; in men for lymphoma, bladder, and pancreatic cancers; and in women for breast, uterus, and thyroid cancers and tumors of the central nervous system.21\n",

In Shexian County, because of elevated altitude and other geographic and climate conditions, underground water resources have been scarce from ancient times. People traditionally rely on rainwater collected during the rainy season by \u201cdry wells\u201d or underground pits. The water is stored for use throughout the year. Because sewage systems are unavailable, water in the pits is easily polluted in the rainy season by human and animal waste. The water is infested with microorganisms. In addition, unaccustomed to the smell, people do not add disinfectant to the water. In the Linxian-Cixian-Shexian area, the prevalence of H pylori infection among adults has been reported as high as 80%-90%.9 Epidemiologically, source of drinking water has been found to be significantly associated with the prevalence of H pylori infection.9 In 2000 we found the prevalence of H pylori infection among a representative sample of Shexian children aged 3-10 years to be 60% by 13C urea breathe test, and 50% of children who drank rainwater were infected by the age of 5 years. The age-specific prevalence of H pylori infection was significantly lower in pipe water than in rainwater drinking areas.",

This hypothesis is supported by a recent systematic review that found, on the basis of study time, that the prevalence of H pylori infection has been decreasing significantly in China from the 1980s to 2010s (P = .00).4 Meanwhile, the incidence of stomach cancer has also been found to be decreasing in China.4 Zhou27 reported that the stomach cancer ASR in China decreased from 1988-2007 by one-third in Peking (from 12.2 to 8.0/100,000), by 42% in Shanghai (from 25.2 to 14.5/100,000), by 24% in Linxian (from 79.1 to 60.3/100,000), and by 7% in Qidong.

The war on esophagogastric cancer in the Taihang Mountain high-risk region in China began as early as 1959 when the endemic of hard-swallowing disease attracted the attention of late primer Zhou Enlai.29 Since then many scientists have visited the Linxian-Cixian-Shexian region to study esophagogastric cancer. Fighting the endemic disease has been placed on the top list of nationally supported championships. When Sino-US relations thawed in 1972 after Chairman Mao and US President Richard Nixon met, scientists from National Cancer Institute of the United States arrived in Linxian to carry out a population-based randomized nutrition intervention trial.30 After decades of vigorous study, Chinese scientists concluded that high levels of nitroso compounds in drinking water, fungus infection in food, nutritional deficiencies, and genetic predisposition were implicated.29 To control the endemic, mass movements such as drying grain and water in the sunshine, marketing of riboflavin-intensified salt, balloon cytology, and endoscopic screening have been successively tried. But never before has a systemic and persistent decrease in the incidence of esophagogastric cancer, similar to what we have just mentioned here, been reported, even in the Sino-US joint population-based intervention trial.30 This example indicates that assigning causation of poverty-related UGIC solely to biological anomalies has not been wholly successful in accounting for all of the relevant factors in the pathogenesis and progression, because it has been the disadvantaged social conditions that predisposed the population to the onset of pathogenesis. In this sense, social inequalities are fundamental causes of the cancer. Social determinants of health can never be ignored or regarded as secondary to biological factors.",

It is perhaps largely because of the disadvantaged socioeconomic status along the Taihang Mountain range in China that we got this opportunity to witness the strength of this connection. Indeed, rural populations in China have been severely and are continually being disadvantaged. The Chinese National Tumor Prevention and Control Office conducted a nationwide cancer mortality survey in 1974-1976.29 It identified several dozen of rural areas with extraordinarily high mortality rates of specific cancer, such as the Linxian-Cixian-Shexian region for esophageal cancer, Qidong County in Jiangsu province for liver cancer, and Qingan County in Jiangxi province for cervical cancer, and so on. This is the origin of so-called high-risk cancer regions in China. Most of these high-risk regions are located in remote or geographically disadvantaged mountainous areas with low levels of socioeconomic development, and the prevalent cancer is often infection-based, poverty-related cancer. During the 1970s, when chemical carcinogenesis theory was popular, strenuous efforts were made by scholars to identify chemical carcinogens in the local environment, and mass movements were launched to curb the suspected carcinogens. However, cancer rates of these high-risk regions had little or only moderate reduction. Only after rapid socioeconomic development began in the 1980s did significant reductions begin to appear, suggesting that cancer control among marginal groups depends on social progress as a whole. This is particularly relevant to a country as vast and unevenly developed as China.",

First, previous studies on urban-rural disparity in cancer in China often defined urban or rural population according to the administration level.32 If it is from a prefecture-level city (eg, province-governing city) or a municipality, the population is considered urban; if it is from a county or county-level city, the registry is regarded as rural. However, in addition to the urban population, a typical Chinese prefecture-level city also includes several rural counties. When these people are misclassified as urban, the real urban-rural difference is diluted. This may explain the contradictory results previously reported in China.7, 32 Regarding this, we compared the ASR between a pure urban and a rural county. Second, although previous studies have noted declining trends in UGIC in parallel with socioeconomic development in Chinese high-risk areas,27, 28 synchronous increasing trends of urbanization-related cancer are rarely reported. Conversely, previous studies on cancer transition in developed countries usually focus on the increase in westernization-related cancer,33, 34 but the decrease in UGIC was less described, because such observations occur only among disadvantaged population in endemic regions. Along with socioeconomic development and urbanization in an endemic area, we noted contrasting trends of dramatically decreasing UGIC as opposed to steadily increasing westernization-related cancers over a 16-year period. Our study reveals a more realistic view regarding the effect of socioeconomic development and urbanization on cancer transition. Third, in Shexian County, cancer screening programs have never been implemented for lung, colorectal, female breast, and cervical cancers. With UGIC, <5% of the incident cases may be discovered by endoscopic screening. Therefore, an increasing trend in the incidence of westernization-related cancers and a decreasing trend in UGICs should not have been influenced by screening.",

Ideally, urban-rural disparity in cancer incidence in Shexian should be assessed by comparing the ASR of the county town to that of the 580 villages, rather than choosing Shijiazhuang as the urban site for comparison, because the population would be more similar but with different urbanization rates. However, as we described earlier, socioeconomic disparity in China exists mainly between people in prefecture cities (province-governing cities) or higher-level cities and people in rural counties. Regarding urban-rural disparity between the county town and villages within a county, because the county town is usually not assigned a development priority under the central planning economic system and there are few factories or enterprises located there, the number of nonagricultural salary-receiving people is very small. Only government employees or workers in public sectors are paid with a monthly salary. For example, the total number of salary-receiving people and their families accounts for only 22% of the population (44,000/196,318) living in the county town of Shexian. The remaining 78% used to be registered rural residents. They have migrated into the county town in recent years. These \u201cfloating\u201d people had been of agrarian origin and were still counted as rural residents in the Chinese National Census. We compared the ASR of cancers between nonagricultural and agricultural Shexian people for the time between 2008-2012, As shown in Figure 4\n, although the ASRs of westernization-related cancers are higher among nonagricultural than among agricultural people, with significant differences noted in women for breast, colorectal, lung, kidney, thyroid, pancreas, ovarian, and corpus uterine cancers, and in men for lung, colorectal, kidney, bladder, larynx, and thyroid cancers and brain tumors, the ASRs of UGIC cancers among agricultural people were not significantly higher than among nonagricultural populations, except for male liver and female esophageal cancer, suggesting agricultural and nonagricultural populations in Shexian County have had similar levels of risk for UGIC under a common macroenvironment.",

Because Shexian County has been an endemic region for esophagogastric cancers, the rural excess of UGIC may be much greater than that in other places in China. However, as described in the Introduction, although the age of the national rural population was significantly younger and the population size was considerably smaller than their national urban counterpart,6 the newly diagnosed esophageal and gastric cancer cases were 3 and 2 times more common, respectively, among rural than among urban population in 2015.7 In this aspect our estimate is representative of the rural excess of UGIC in China.",
