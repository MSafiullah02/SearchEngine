Literature on international green energy trade disputes in the WTO, however, have predominantly focused on the consistency of green energy policies with WTO law and the balance between WTO obligations and domestic public policy space as a way to address environmental and climate change objectives (Rubini ).

            "text": "It is therefore important to analyse green energy security in the law of the WTO for a number of reasons. First, the WTO acts as the primary global trade governance body and plays a key role in settling interstate trade disputes through panels and the Appellate Body of its Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). Since the WTO DSB has come to act as a significant international forum to channel complaints related to trade restrictive measures supporting green energy development, it is therefore relevant to explore trends in energy security put forward to this specialised tribunal. Second, as the WTO DSB makes crucial jurisprudential moves that impact domestic law and policies, WTO Member States need to take WTO rules into account when shaping their domestic green energy law and policies. Therefore, a legal analysis of energy security in the green energy context within the WTO rules is needed, in particular, how a well-designed energy security policy promoting green energy could fail or succeed the various public policy exceptions provided in the law of the WTO. Third, with increasing green energy trade disputes under the WTO DSB over the years, more trade disputes might be heard at the WTO on the subject of green energy security as to the purpose of government support for green energy. This chapter, then, explores whether there is any flexibility within the current WTO rules and the interpretations given to them that permit trade restrictive measures that support national green energy development with a view of ensuring energy security, i.e. green energy security.",

Countries, therefore, have adopted trade restrictive measures, particularly local content requirements and subsidies, as instruments to develop a national green energy industry. These trade restrictive measures, however, have been challenged in green energy legal disputes under the WTO DSB. Canada-Certain Measures Affecting the Renewable Energy Generation Sector (WT/DS412), Canada-Measures Relating to the Feed-in Tariff Programme (WT/DS426) and India-Certain Measures Relating to Solar Cells and Solar Modules (WT/DS456) are examples here. The analysis of these cases in the literature focuses on justifying these trade restrictive measures on environmental and climate change grounds (Rubini 2012; Shadikhodjaev 2017; Karttunen and Moore 2018) . However, these cases also raise issues surrounding energy security as a justification under WTO rules for trade restrictive measures to support green energy development, but this has been largely unexplored.

An analysis of the WTO green energy disputes involving energy security will also reveal that energy security concepts have been raised differently by respondents, and broader concepts of energy security found in the literature which include environmental, climate and social considerations have not reached the jurisprudence in the WTO system yet. The analyses of room for green energy security as a justification for trade restrictive measures will demonstrate that there might be some room for green energy security within the defences under Articles III:8(a), XX(a) and (j) and Article XXI. However, these defences have limited applicability and may also have undesirable outcomes. Finally, this chapter will argue that an evenly distributed market share of green energy technologies and equipment around the world is the best solution to ensure green energy security in the context of the just energy transition and propose a way forward to create the legal space within the WTO for trade restrictive measures aimed at ensuring green energy security.",

In general, when people talk about the PV industry, the main focus is on the solar-cell and module manufacturers. However, there is also the upstream industry (e.g. materials, polysilicon production, wafer production and equipment manufacturing) as well as the downstream industry (e.g. inverters, balance of system (BOS) components, system development, project development, financing, installations and integration into existing or future electricity infrastructure, plant operators, operation and maintenance) (J\u00e4ger-Waldau 2017).

Until the 1980s, it was a conventional wisdom of the post-war years that markets are hopelessly inadequate in providing appropriate energy supplies (Helm 2004) , and governments worldwide have considered the energy sector too crucial to be left to market forces. Accordingly, monopoly was the norm (Kirschen and Strbac 2004) . However, with the deregulation movement, there was a paradigm shift in the electricity industry across the world from a system of State ownership and centralised management to one that favours decentralised structures, competition, independent regulatory oversight, and private ownership (OECD 2000) . As a result, trade in electricity is a new dimension of trade in energy, in which the green energy sector plays an important role. As such, industries in the green energy sector have not been dominated by State-owned vertically integrated utilities, who would typically have engaged in the production, transport and distribution of energy products. As a result, this has left ample margins for trade and competition.",

The WTO members are obliged to grant MFN treatment immediately and unconditionally. Thus, according to the MFN obligation, discrimination between trading partners is prohibited under WTO law.

The basic concept is that imported products shall be accorded treatment 'no less favourable' than that accorded to domestic products.

When the original GATT was drafted in 1947, energy was not contemplated. The former WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy explained the absence of energy as a distinct sector by stating that '[w]hen the rules of the GATT-which preceded the WTO-were negotiated 60 years ago, opening trade in energy was not a political priority. World energy demand was a fraction of today's and you could buy a barrel of crude oil for USD20 at current prices' (Lamy 2007) . Cross-border trade for grid-linked energy was not very developed at the time of the GATT negotiations either (Selivanova 2014 ). In addition, at that time, green energy was neither on the agenda of the institutions of global governance nor the domestic policy agenda of member countries. Thus, interest in green energy was not a major concern. The emphasis was on economic reconstruction following the destruction of World War II, and avoiding a depression like that which took place after World War I.",

Biofuels partially fall under the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), with the application of its regime to bioethanol. Furthermore, the green energy sector is strongly based upon services, such as metering, scoping, scouting, engineering and maintenance of installations and finance, and thus fall under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Technical standards, which are of crucial importance for safety as well as for achieving high productivity, fall under the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT).

For instance, should energy be defined in terms of products or in terms of their use? Marceau (2010) suggests that energy should be defined as the action (product and process) through which energy-containing natural resources are transformed and consumed in response to a series of societal and individual human requirements for heat and power. However, the author notes that such a definition is not sufficient for WTO purposes as it does not fall neatly within the goods/services parameters of the WTO (Marceau 2010) . There is no agreement, for instance, on whether electricity qualifies as a good or a service under WTO rules. This impacts upon electricity produced from green energy sources because WTO rules are based on a distinction between goods and services and, depending on the classification, different WTO rules apply. However, whilst classificatory ambiguities should certainly be noted in terms of their legal relevance, it is not the purpose of this chapter to provide a detailed analysis with regards to this matter. Rather, the emphasis is on the policy space for green energy security in the law of the WTO, an issue that will, in all likelihood, have to be addressed as a result of increasing links between energy security and green energy development, and as this body of law continues to be elaborated.",

The recent WTO case on conventional energy between Russia and the European Union (EU), European Union and its member States-Certain Measures relating to the Energy Sector (WT/DS476/R) is another example of how a lack of agreed definition on security of energy supply can create controversy. In this case, Russia submitted that \"neither the Directive nor any other EU authority on the record identifies a clear and consistent definition of security of supply\" and in Russia's view, this was \"deliberate\" and meant to \"maximize [the European Union's] discretion to define security of supply in the manner most advantageous to its overall objectives, to include reducing reliance on Russian pipeline transport services and natural gas imports.\" Therefore, an analysis of how energy security has been configured through WTO case law is important and timely.

The case Canada-Renewable Energy initiated by Japan in 2010, and prompted the WTO Dispute Settlement Body to decide, for the first time, on matters relating to trade in green energy, specifically the legal status of renewable energy and measures of support to enhance its contribution to a specific nation's energy matrix. Almost a year later, the EU also started a dispute under Canada-Feed-In Tariff Programme with regards to the same issue. The central complaint in these two cases related to the domestic content requirements for certain wind and solar photovoltaic electricity generation projects in the feed-in tariff programme (the 'FIT Programme'), established by the Canadian Province of Ontario, and the discriminatory treatment affecting imports of renewable energy generation equipment this led to. Generally, a feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme is designed to promote investment in the development of the green energy industry. A FIT typically provides for a fixed price for green electricity per kilowatt-hour fed into the grid on a common basis via long-term contracts (Mendon\u00e7a et al. 2010) .

This would require security of supply of energy products, such as solar cells and modules.

Thus, in pursuance of energy security, government intervention was necessary in order to ensure domestic resilience in addressing any supply side disruptions since any dependence on imports brought with it risks associated with supply side vulnerabilities and fluctuations. As such, from India's perspective, the domestic content requirement measures disputed by the US did not seek to maximise self-sufficiency by reducing imports of solar cells and modules; instead they aimed to ensure the existence of an adequate domestic manufacturing capacity and human skills in order to reduce the risks linked to dependence solely on imports of solar cells and modules which were intrinsic to solar power generation. Interestingly, some participants in the case study on GB in Chap. 2 also highlighted the link between energy security and the importation of energy equipment, technology and expertise as well as maintenance of human resources in the country and their energy skills and capabilities.

In this approach, reducing barriers to trade fosters energy security, so the goal is to keep energy markets open and fight protectionism. Liberalisation of international trade is advanced by complainants in the WTO green energy disputes as a way to have access to the best available technology from the global marketplace at competitive prices. Countries which depend profoundly on energy equipment and technology imports have to rely on the secure and smooth-functioning of international trade in energy in order to ensure security of energy supply. Participants in the case study on GB also presented the argument that restrictions in access to green energy technology markets would affect energy security as some green energy equipment is not produced in the country. One can, therefore, conclude that green energy technology and equipment import dependence can entail green energy security issues, particularly for green energy import dependent countries, if trade is not available. Although green energy equipment can be easily traded or transported short and long distances, situations of supply constraints, such as pandemics, political unrest, conflicts and trade embargoes, can occur. These trade disruptions usually happen without much warning and do not allow time for countries to plan different energy strategies to ensure green energy security. One of the goals of the transition to a low carbon energy system is to increase the participation of green energy in the energy mix. As a consequence, countries dependent on solar and wind energy as a dominant energy source, for example, may be more common in the future. In these cases, if a country's energy mix is designed to be dependent on solar and wind energies, trade restrictions on equipment in this area without advance warning would not realistically allow countries to plan their energy supply from other energy sources and produce the necessary green energy equipment while the trade restrictions issues are solved.",

One can argue that temporarily restricting trade imports could cause energy insecurity in importing countries. For example, if an importing country restricted the importation of non-locally produced green energy technology, it would negatively impact the security of green energy supply, because the country would not have this product available nationally and would not have access to the product internationally. Each country, however, is best situated to assess its own energy security interests and to decide whether essential energy security interests are at stake relative to certain types of trade measures. Energy security is context dependent and countries could plan their energy strategies to ensure that energy would still be available if they chose to temporarily restrict the trade. For instance, if solar energy equipment importing countries wanted to develop their national solar energy industry, they could temporarily plan to ensure energy security from other energy sources while a percentage of its solar energy domestic market is developed. Strategic plans, therefore, could prevent any general energy supply interruption.",

The case of Brazil serves as an example that green energy manufacturing facilities do not just spring up overnight. As seen in Chap. 3, during the 2001 energy crisis, Brazil acted to develop wind energy via its Emergency Programme for Wind Energy, PROEOLICA, to ensure energy security. Evidence showed that a domestic manufacturing base could not be developed in the short-term, because the industry could not be dependent on very few national suppliers for the viability of wind energy projects in Brazil in that initial development period. At the time, there was only one national manufacturer of complete equipment for wind turbines and only a few manufacturers of parts for wind turbines. Therefore, it was expected that the majority of wind equipment would be imported. However, in cases where this international trade is restricted, the country would not be able to ensure its green energy security.",

The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on green energy trade is still unknown and so far there has not been any political unrest, conflict or trade embargo with regards to green energy equipment. However, today there is concentration of some green energy equipment in the hands of a few. In 2016, for instance, of the 20 largest solar cells production companies, in terms of actual production/shipments, 11 were 100% Chinese and an additional five had Chinese participation (J\u00e4ger-Waldau 2017). In the same year, China and Taiwan held a share of 68% of PV module production in the world (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems 2018). This market share dominance, on the one hand, may not have any negative impact on the energy security of an importer country if access to the supply of the product is stable, accessible and reliable. On the other hand, if this market share dominance makes international trade unreliable, then it is a factor which should be considered when examining energy security concerns.",

An evenly distributed market share of green energy technologies and equipment around the world is the best solution to ensure energy security in the context of the just energy transition. No country should depend totally on a few suppliers. The diversification of green energy players in the market is essential and the WTO has an important role to play in achieving this goal.

            "text": "The previous section shows evidence that WTO Member States are increasingly associating energy security with green energy in their legal disputes under the WTO DSB. Member States which have adopted or intend to adopt trade restrictive measures to support national green energy development with a view of ensuring energy security should familiarise themselves with the following question: Does WTO law provide room for national public policy on green energy security grounds? This section aims at answering this question in the context of the WTO agreement on trade in goods, GATT, an agreement that has been raised in all green energy disputes in the WTO system so far. As such, this section is not intended to be either definitive or exhaustive of the legal defences around green energy security within all agreements of the WTO framework. Instead, it focuses on room for green energy security within the current exceptions under GATT. As a rule, WTO Member States are required to design their internal legislation and regulations in a way that is compatible with WTO law. However, if a WTO Member State wishes to pursue some legitimate non-trade policy objectives, it may enact certain measures that, although inconsistent with WTO rules, may still be justified under GATT. Literature on green energy development and the GATT exceptions focuses mainly on environmental and climate change grounds within the scope of GATT Article XX(b) relating to measures 'necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health' and GATT Article XX(g) relating to 'the conservation of exhaustible natural resources' (Rubini 2012; Oniemola 2013; Maggio 2017) . In the context of green energy security, the examination of four legal defences under GATT is pertinent: Article III:8(a), Article XX(a), Article XX(j) and Article XXI.",

Sarmah argues that this appears to cover several public-private partnerships, especially those secured through a tendering process (Sarmah 2017) .

In the given cases, the foreign product was the green energy generation equipment (manufactured/purchased by the private sector to generate electricity) while the product purchased by the Ontario and India governments was electricity. Therefore, the discrimination relating to generation equipment contained in the FIT Programme was not covered by the derogation of Article III:8(a) of the GATT 1994.

If the Appellate Body's position is followed in future disputes, one of the primary conditions for Article III:8(a) of the GATT to be applied is that the trade restrictive measures should be in relation to the product purchased by the government. Therefore, if the trade restrictive measures are directed to green energy equipment, then the government itself should purchase the equipment and generate green electricity. This would, as a result, amount to a situation where the government could only directly acquire the green energy equipment and generate electricity from it. This implies the existence of an electricity market structure with more government interference and participation in the electricity sector, as the role of electricity generation would be carried out by the government.",

Therefore, what can be concluded here is that the panel and Appellate Body may have wanted to prevent protectionist measures, but their limited approach may have had the opposite effect. As shown in the case study in GB, for example, participants pointed out that the government would be held responsible and accountable for energy interruption in the country. This may also apply to many other countries. As such, in attempting to prevent trade litigation and be compliant with WTO law, Member States, particularly countries facing energy security issues, may decide to take control of their national electricity system and exclude the participation of the private sector so as to enable them to adopt policies necessary to ensure their green energy security.",

As such, the discriminatory aspects of the trade restrictive measure would need to be necessary in order to ensure continuity of green energy supply.",

Thus, the exception under Article XX(a) would probably not succeed for green energy security if green energy technologies were available to be imported. Also, the complaining parties would probably suggest WTO-consistent alternative approaches, such as the lowering of trade barriers to green energy technologies, as a more effective approach of achieving green energy security objectives. WTO-consistent alternative approaches could be valid for ensuring short-term energy security, but not for long-term energy security in circumstances where countries are adopting strategies to have domestic green energy technologies available in cases of trade supply disruptions. Thus, the exception under Article XX(a) is only likely to succeed in situations where there is no green energy technologies available in the international market to be imported. However, as previously stated, the development of a green energy technology industry is not straightforward, so countries would be in a position where they would need to cope with social disruption for some time until their domestic industry is developed to ensure green energy security.",

An analysis of the defences under GATS is outside the scope of this chapter. However, the recent Panel's decision in EU-Energy Package on the public order exception under GATS Article XIV(a) provides insights into how future disputes on green energy security may unfold in the WTO DSB, as the Panel concluded that security of energy supply is a fundamental interest of society within the meaning of footnote 5 to Article XIV(a) of the GATS. EU-Energy Package is a recent and the only WTO case so far where security of energy supply was directly related to maintenance of public order. In EU-Energy Package, the European Union (EU) raised the public order exception under GATS Article XIV(a), arguing that the trade restrictive measure was necessary to ensure the EU's security of energy supply and hence to maintain public order on the basis that security of energy supply is a fundamental interest of society. Although dealing with the interpretation of the public order exception rather than the public morals exception, and with conventional energy rather than green energy, the recent Panel's decision in EU-Energy Package made important remarks relating to the concept of security of energy supply.",

However, a certain minimum level of clarity is required in order to assess, in a meaningful manner, whether a stated interest can be considered a fundamental interest of society within the meaning of footnote 5.

Given the multiplicity of energy security concepts shown in previous chapters, and the manipulation of energy security language for one's own interest as shown in the case study on GB in Chap. 4, this approach leaves broad discretion for energy security to be defined in proceedings in a way which is most advantageous for the responding party. It is unfortunate that the Panel took this approach as, based on this, it would be wise for Member States not to define energy security in their laws and policies, as this would limit the range of interpretative possibilities relating to the concept that a respondent party could raise as defence.

Therefore, that social disruption has materialised is not a prerequisite for the public order exception. What is needed is the existence of a real and true possibility of security of supply being undermined. As this was the standard applied to public order, there is no reason as to why a Panel would apply a higher standard to the public morals exception. Therefore, it seems that it is sufficient for a Member State to show evidence that social unrest as a result of lack of security of green energy supply would undermine the protection of public morals. The materialisation of social unrest is not necessary. However, this exception for green energy security is still likely to fail if there is international green energy technologies trade. This exception, therefore, does not allow for countries to strategically prepare in advance for long-term green energy security in circumstances where international trade is not available.",

Therefore, a Member State cannot raise the argument that it needs its own domestic production of green energy equipment when there is access to the international supply of the product. Thus, if there is supply availability of the product in the international market, Article XX(j) cannot be raised; (ii) There must be imminent risks of supply shortage or actual supply shortage of green energy equipment, not potential risks. The simple existence of low domestic manufacturing capacity does not qualify as an imminent risk. Thus, evidence of the lack of supply or evidence of imminent risks of supply shortage is key for the applicability of Article XX(j). Arguments about possible shortages in the future do not fall within Article XX(j). The level of domestic production, the relevant product and geographic market, potential price fluctuations, and accessibility of international supplies, for instance, will be taken into account to demonstrate the availability and sufficiency of the product. Also, in assessing whether a product is in general or local short supply, the stage of development of a Member State should be taken into account in determining exposure to supply disruption. As noted by the Appellate Body, 'different levels of economic development of Members may, depending on the circumstances, impact the availability of supply of a product in a given market. Developing countries may, for example, have less domestic production, and may be more vulnerable to disruptions in supply than developed countries.' Although the Appellate Body leaves more room to apply the short supply exception under Article XX(j) to developing countries, only allowing imminent or actual risks of supply shortage may still cause greater adverse impact on developing countries that are dependent on imported green energy technological products. These products require a certain level of human and technological expertise and time in order to develop an adequate domestic manufacturing capacity, and if there is a significant imminent or actual supply shortage it may be too late to adopt measures that avoid green energy supply disruption; (iii) The trade restrictive measures must be essential to address the situation of short supply. The meaning of essential was not clarified by the Appellate Body. However, the Appellate Body points out that the same process of weighing and balancing a series of factors for a \"necessity\" analysis under Article XX(d) is relevant in assessing \"essential\" under Article XX(j).",

Although GATT Article XXI was not drafted with energy trade in mind (Shih 2009 ), the fact that traditional energy goods could rely on the national security exception under Article XXI has already been accepted by the WTO (1998) . Nonetheless, the reference to 'traditional energy goods' can be precisely interpreted as fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Scholars have also already suggested the use of energy security as a ground on which national measures can be insulated from trade under the national security exception of GATT Article XXI on the basis that energy products and services are absolutely essential for society to function (Zillman 1994; Shih 2009; Hough 2010; Nedumpara 2014 ).

            "text": "Another way of attempting to include green energy security within the scope of Article XXI is to ask whether economic security can amount to national security interest. It is widely acknowledged that energy is an essential enabler of economic prosperity. As demonstrated in the case studies of GB and Brazil, energy supply interruption not only negatively impact the economy in terms of production and job availability, for instance, but also in terms of attracting investments. Energy security is, therefore, essential for the well-functioning of an economy. In the case study of Brazil, in particular, the framing of energy security was in the context of economic development, demonstrating that energy security in Brazil is first and foremost an economic issue. In this sense, green energy supply interruption, particularly supply of biofuels in the context of Brazil, could negatively impact the economy not only as a result of lack of energy, but also as a result of reduction of the economic output for the country from biofuels. Therefore, associating green energy with economic security is not a difficult task. In these circumstances, could a Member State raise the argument of economic security under Article XXI in order to adopt trade restrictive measures to promote green energy development? So far, economic security has not been invoked under GATT Article XXI in a WTO dispute. However, in the literature, economic security has been argued to be a dimension of national security (Covey 1996; Ronis 2011; Valdron 2016; Antonova and Ponomarenko 2016) , particularly as a result of increased interdependence in global markets where one nation's default may trigger a worldwide chain reaction, cascade failures and may cause a calamity (Romm 1993) . Economic security has been broadly defined to include securing a nation's industrial and technological base, access to critical materials and resources and the functioning of critical infrastructures and services that are required for critical societal functions (Fj\u00e4der 2016) as well as with reference to global capital and commodities markets flows (Rickards 2009 ).",

Invocation of the national security exception under Article XXI to defend trade restrictive green energy measures may also be possible, but will have the consequence of green energy being securitised.

Green energy security should be a critical long-term domestic policy goal, and, as such, should not be ignored in the WTO and should assume a high profile in this system due to the need to transition to a low carbon energy system. The WTO seeks liberalised trade in a world where green energy technologies are still an emerging industry in most countries. The WTO, therefore, should support the creation of competitive and stable domestic industries that could supply the domestic and international markets. The proposal which follows is based on the assumption that where domestic producers could not compete with foreign imports absent government protection, WTO law should allow the protection afforded to domestic producers, so that such producers can develop their industry. Support for the development of domestic green energy industries worldwide could enable an otherwise uncompetitive domestic industry to become competitive to such an extent that it could supply the national and international markets, resulting in a more evenly distributed global green energy market and lower prices for consumers and, therefore, a net welfare benefit in terms of social development and inclusion worldwide.",

One may criticise this proposal as inadequate for a sustainable non-discriminatory multilateral trading system. However, this type of measures would be transitional and would assist in bringing a plurality of green energy players into the national and global green energy markets.

It allows the Ministerial Conference '[i]n exceptional circumstances\u2026 to waive an obligation imposed on a Member by this Agreement or any of the Multilateral Trade Agreements, provided that any such decision shall be taken by three-fourths of the Members'. Thus, the WTO waiver is the power of the WTO Ministerial Conference to suspend any legal obligation of the WTO Agreement or the annexed Multilateral Trade Agreements to address tensions, such as the tension between international governance and domestic government, and the tension between societies at different stages of economic development and with different forms of government (Feichtner 2011). The waiver is a binding legal act which formally suspends legal obligations and thus allows for non-compliance without putting into question the validity of WTO law (Schermers and Blokker 2003) . The waiver, therefore, can allow Member States to take measures in violation of WTO obligations in respect of green energy development. Thus, Member States should consider the waiver as an option for policy space for green energy security as its use would flexibilise WTO law and thus address the tensions identified above.",

Interestingly, the energy security concept as raised by Canada is the same concept raised by the majority of participants in the case study of GB, which is correlated to the view adopted by the UK government in recent policy documents. The concept raised by India which include the elements of availability, reliability and affordability is the same concept in the current legal framework in Brazil as shown in Chap. 3. However, energy security concept is dynamic and evolves, so it may be just a coincidence that developed countries, i.e. Canada and UK, currently use the same concept, while emerging economies, i.e. India and Brazil, currently use the same concepts.

While the panel focused on green energy not supporting energy security due to green energy intermittent nature, the Appellate Body advanced the role played by green energy in ensuring energy security in the long-term. From a legal perspective this divergence in frames has implications for the interplay between energy security and green energy under WTO law, because the frame adopted can impact the applicability and interpretation of WTO provisions. The negative frame, for instance, cuts down the room for energy security to be raised as a legal defence for trade restrictive measures adopted to promote green energy. Such negative frame might signal about the inability of WTO to adapt to a changing global landscape and add to the discontent among its membership.",

However, under Article XX(a), this means that the defence only applies in circumstances where there is no international trade available, and the exception under Article XX(j) also requires actual or imminent short supply. These two exceptions under GATT Article XX are only likely to succeed in situations where there are no green energy technologies available in the international market to be imported. However, the development of a green energy technology industry is not straightforward, so countries would be left in a position where they would need to cope with the negative consequences of imminent or actual green energy supply disruption for some time until their domestic industry is developed to ensure green energy security. These defences are also inapplicable to countries wishing to adopt trade restrictive measures to develop their national green energy industry as a strategic way to prepare them for any circumstances where there is limited or no international trade, such as pandemics, political unrest, conflicts and trade embargoes.",

The panel and Appellate Body may have wanted to prevent protectionist measures, but their limited approach may have the opposite effect. In attempting to prevent trade litigation and be compliant with WTO law, State Members, particularly countries facing energy security issues, may decide to take control of their national electricity systems and exclude the participation of the private sector to adopt policies necessary to ensure their green energy security.",

In any case, given the negative consequences of securitisation, such as justification for using military force or other instruments of coercion, overriding access to information, reinforcing discourses of control, restricting public participation and limiting individual freedom, GATT Article XXI should be used as a last resort.",

However, rule change through litigation strategies to alter the interpretation of existing WTO rules has negative aspects, such as governments having to use taxpayers' money to resort to the lengthy and costly litigation process under the WTO.

This work, therefore, proposed a way forward to create the legal space within the WTO for trade restrictive measures aimed at ensuring green energy security. The proposal involved allowing temporary trade restrictive measures subject to an economic and technical analysis of the most viable and efficient manner to develop green energy technologies domestically in accordance with a country's circumstances, so that Member States could develop a percentage of their national green energy industry. With this proposal, domestic policies supporting the development and scale-up of green energy for energy security purposes would be more explicitly permissible and thus sheltered from legal challenge.
