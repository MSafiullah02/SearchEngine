            "text": "Many countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, emergency mental health legislation in response to the global pandemic of . In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to permit the Mental Health Commission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on its designated panel). This independent examination may occur 'in person', 'by other appropriate means', or even, 'due to the exigencies of the public health emergency', not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that 'the exigencies of the public health emergency' might hamper the independent psychiatrist's work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist 'no earlier than the day before' the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals 'consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor'. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise 'necessary in the interest of the patient'. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days 'of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary'. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide 'a written statement' rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho-surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof light of Covid-19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice. With good communication, efficient team-working and close adherence to professional codes of practice and ethics, it is hoped that these amendments will result in a review system that is as reasonable, robust and reassuring as the current, highly unusual circumstances permit.",

While the treating psychiatrist was generally interviewed by telephone, the other two elements of this assessment required the independent psychiatrist to attend the approved centre in person in order to examine the involuntary patient and review the records.

Permitting the independent examination to be performed by 'other J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof appropriate means' presumably permits remote examination, by video-link or telephone. The tolerance of no examination whatsoever presumably acknowledges the fact that remote examination is not always possible with, for example, a highly disturbed patient who is in seclusion.

This is a considerable assumption in terms of both the human resources and technological capabilities of approved centres during the public health emergency.

While not all patients attended their tribunals in the past, many of them did, and this change will have considerable psychological and emotional significance for certain patients. In addition, some patients might have poor reading and writing skills, so this provision will place considerable additional responsibility on patients' legal representatives to ensure that their clients' views are conveyed to the tribunal, although patients will still be able to attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call (Mental Health Commission, 2020).

The 2001 Act specified that each mental health tribunal would comprise three members, including one consultant psychiatrist, one barrister or solicitor of no fewer than seven years' experience (the chairperson) and one other person, known as the lay member (Section 48(3)). The 2020 Act states that 'where it appears to the [Mental Health] Commission that, due to the exigencies of the public health emergency, a tribunal cannot be appointed in accordance with those subsections, it may appoint a tribunal consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor who has had not less than 7 years' experience as a practising barrister or solicitor ending immediately before such appointment' (Section 20).If a one-person tribunal is appointed, 'the tribunal concerned shall consult with a consultant psychiatrist, other than the consultant psychiatrists who prepared the reports under Section 17(1) (c) [the independent psychiatrist] and (d) [the treating psychiatrist], for the purpose of making a decision [\u2026] where (a) the opinions expressed in the reports underSection 17(1)(c) and (d) as to whether the patient is suffering from a mental disorder differ, or (b) it otherwise considers that it is necessary in the interest of the patient to do so' (Section . The Mental Health Commission shall appoint a consultant psychiatrist for this consultation purpose (Section 21) although this provision 'shall not apply where the tribunal is unable, due to the exigencies of the public health emergency, to consult' in this way (Section 18).There is also a change to the power of tribunals to extend involuntary admission or renewal orders. The 2001 Act stated that such orders 'may be extended by order by the tribunal concerned (either of its own motion or at the request of the patient concerned) for a further period of 14 days and thereafter may be further extended by it by order for a period of 14 days on the application of the patient if the tribunal is satisfied that it is in the interest of the patient' (Section 18",

            "text": "'s Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 introduces significant changes to the Mental Health Act, 2001 owing to the public health emergency presented by Covid-19. In summary, the 2020 amendments permit the Mental HealthCommission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on the designated panel). The independent examination may occur 'in person', 'by other appropriate means', or even, 'due to the exigencies of the public health emergency', not occur at all, once this is explained in the report (Section 17(c)). The 2020 Act acknowledges that 'the exigencies of the public health emergency' might hamper the independent psychiatrist in their work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist 'no earlier than the day before' the tribunal (Section 17(a)), in lieu of the treating psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although the treating psychiatrist will still attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call (Mental Health Commission, 2020).The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals 'consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor' (Section 20). Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise 'necessary in the interest of the patient' (Section 18). A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days 'of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary due to the exigencies of the public health emergency' (Section 18). Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients (Section 19); a tribunal can direct a witness toThe independent psychiatric report is a key element in the review process for involuntary patients. The amendments outlined in the 2020 Act make significant changes to this element of the process. To date, psychiatrists who carry out these independent psychiatric reports are formally recruited by the Mental Health Commission to a panel of independent psychiatrists through competitive interviews that are followed by a training programme for successful candidates. The 2020 Act allows the Mental Health Commission to engage psychiatrists who have not undergone these interview and training processes to carry out independent reports. This provision presumably reflects, in the words of the 2020 Act, 'the effect, on the availability of consultant psychiatrists and other persons to perform functions under this Act, of the spread of Covid-19 and of the deployment of the resources of the health services in order to (i) prevent, minimise or limit the risk of persons being infected with (ii)    test persons for Covid-19, and (iii) provide care and treatment to persons infected with Covid-19' (Section 16). In other words, there might be a shortage of independent psychiatrists from the formal panel if too many of them are either ill or redeployed to other areas of the health service. This measure, then, broadens the pool of psychiatrists from which",

            "text": "Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 introduces significant changes in relation to mental health tribunals. Perhaps the most dramatic shift is the move from a three-person to a one-person tribunal, if necessary. Such a tribunal shall consist 'of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor who has had not less than 7 years' experience as a practising barrister or solicitor' (Section 20). The idea of a one-person that the most common international practice is for a three-person review board comprising a psychiatrist, a person with legal qualifications and what is generally regarded as a community/lay member, the group members opted to look for evidence of the operation of a one-person review board elsewhere. Other jurisdictions specifically reviewed include England, Scotland, Victoria and New South Wales.The suggestion put forward to the group members was that a single-person review board with a high-level legal qualification who perhaps would operate on a full-time basis might not just offer an alternative structure to the current one in operation, but would allow the sole person to develop particular 'judicial' expertise in this field while still having a medical report prepared for him/her by an independent consultant psychiatrist. While members saw certain merits in this proposal, the fact that the state of Victoria in Australia seems to be the only jurisdiction which has operated a oneperson review board system did not offer high hopes that this was the way of the future. Victoria, in fact, has recently decided to return to a three-person model\u2026On that basis and in the absence of any compelling reasons for change the group recommends that there should be no change in the current composition of review boards at this time. However, this question should be re-examined in any future review of the mental health legislation (Expert Group on the Review of the Mental Health Act, 2001, 2015; p.45).Clearly, the possible loss of the perspective of the lay person from some tribunals as a result of the 2020 Act would be significant, but it is helpful that a one-person tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise 'necessary in the interest of the patient' (Section 18). The possibility of one-person tribunals is the most questionable change introduced in the new legislation and it is difficult to justify in terms of proportionality, especially if tribunals can be held remotely. It is to be hoped that such tribunals, if used at all, will be constituted only as a last resort when a three-person tribunal absolutely cannot be assembled.The possibility of a tribunal extending an admission or renewal order by a second period of 14 days 'if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof that it is necessary due to the exigencies of the public health emergency' (Section 18) appears reasonable if regrettable, as are the prioritisation of tribunals for current involuntary patients over discharged patients(Section 19)  and the possibility of written statements from witnesses (Section 21). The ban on psycho-surgery for involuntary patients (Section 22) and the transitional provisions are also reasonable (Section 24).",
