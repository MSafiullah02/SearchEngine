Clostridium perfringens typically affects foals younger than 10 days of age. Clostridium perfringens serotypes A and C are most commonly implicated, with serotype C resulting in more severe disease, hemorrhagic diarrhea, and higher mortality than that seen with serotype A.26, 27 Serotype A is commonly isolated from the feces of normal foals, but the organism in general is more commonly isolated from foals with diarrhea.28, 29 A diagnosis is typically based on the presence of compatible clinical signs and culture of the organism from feces, preferably with genotyping of the obtained isolate. Observation of large, gram-positive rods or spores on a fecal Gram stain should raise the index of suspicion.26\nClostridium difficile has also been implicated as a cause of diarrhea in foals. Disease severity can vary from mild to hemorrhagic diarrhea. As with C. perfringens, C. difficile can be isolated from asymptomatic foals, thus toxin detection in feces is useful for confirmation of a diagnosis.30, 31 Commercial immunoassays are available for the detection of toxins A and B in feces, as well as the enterotoxin of C. perfringens.\n32 Treatment is supportive with the addition of directed antimicrobial therapy, typically with metronidazole. In some geographic locations, documented metronidazole resistance in C. difficile isolates has prompted therapy with vancomycin in select cases.33 Infection with Lawsonia intracellularis has been described in older foals.34, 35, 36, 37 Infection with this obligate intracellular pathogen results in a proliferative enteropathy and should be suspected in any weanling age foal with severe hypoproteinemia. Clinical signs include weight loss, ill thrift, depression, colic, peripheral edema, and variable fecal consistency, ranging from soft normal to watery diarrhea. Protein loss can be severe. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs in combination with results of fecal PCR and serum antibody testing. Treatment includes supportive care, predominantly with colloid replacement, and directed antimicrobial therapy. Common specific recommendations include chloramphenicol and oxytetracycline followed by doxycycline, erythromycin, or clarithromycin.38, 39, 40 Duration of treatment is dictated by clinical status and improvement of clinicopathologic findings; a minimum of 3 weeks of treatment is typically indicated.",

            "text": "The most commonly encountered viral pathogen causing diarrhea in foals is rotavirus. Typically, rotavirus is thought to affect foals between 5 and 35 days of age,41 although recent data suggest the mean age of affected foals can be as high as 81 days.24 Older foals appear to be less severely affected.42 The most common and obvious clinical sign is diarrhea, and fecal consistency can vary greatly. Other signs relate to disease severity, including depression, anorexia, dehydration, and other similar findings. The virus causes blunting of the small intestinal microvilli, resulting in malabsorption and maldigestion. Diagnosis can be confirmed with fecal electron microscopy, which has a significant lag time, or commercial immunoassays, also performed on feces. Treatment is principally supportive. Emphasis must be placed on biosecurity protocols to prevent spread of new outbreaks. Because this is a nonenveloped virus, typical antiviral disinfectant compounds, such as quaternary ammonium mixtures, are ineffective against rotavirus. The virus is extremely contagious, with morbidity often approaching 100% in farm outbreaks. Prognosis is very good to excellent with supportive care, and mortality is typically very low in uncomplicated cases. Other viral disorders occur much less frequently and include coronavirus43, 44, 45 and adenovirus.46, 47\n",

Horses do not appear predisposed to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which is common in dogs and human beings. One disorder that has a suspected, but to this point unsubstantiated, infectious origin is duodenitis/proximal jejunitis (DPJ), a syndrome of small intestinal inflammation primarily characterized by copious quantities of gastric reflux. This syndrome has also been termed anterior enteritis or proximal enteritis. In most cases, an underlying etiology cannot be determined. In some cases, Salmonella spp. or Clostridium spp. can be isolated from culture of gastric reflux. Salmonella has not been consistently identified in a majority of cases, and many horses with documented infections by these organisms do not develop DPJ. Recently, toxigenic strains of C. difficile were isolated from the reflux of 10 of 10 horses with DPJ and 1 of 16 control horses with other causes of nasogastric reflux.49 Further investigation of this organism is clearly warranted. Another suspected infectious cause is Fusarium spp.50 In one epidemiologic report, affected horses were fed significantly more concentrate and were more likely to have grazed pasture than unaffected controls.51 Regardless of the initiating cause, inflammatory-mediated alterations in secretion and motility contribute to a functional obstruction and a vicious cycle of events. Intestinal inflammation can result in alterations in normal sensory-motor function, mucosal function, ion transport, and transepithelial permeability. The blanket term duodenitis/proximal jejunitis may actually encompass a wide spectrum of inflammatory small intestinal disorders resulting in a similar clinical syndrome.",

Paired serum samples (acute and convalescent) should be collected within 5 to 7 days rather than the conventional interval of 2 to 4 weeks because infected horses rapidly develop high titers. Several laboratories interpret a single serum titer of \u226580 at the onset of signs as consistent with PHF once horses develop diarrhea. However, given the variation in the immune response of individual horses and the variation in clinical signs wherein some horses do not develop diarrhea, paired serum must be utilized even if the first sample was negative. Vaccination for PHF results in positive titers that usually disappear by 6 to 9 months, and previous subclinical exposure has prolonged waxing and waning titers for over a year. Polymerase chain reaction detects the presence of antigen and has excellent sensitivity without the potential for interference from vaccination,70, 71 and both feces and blood should be tested since the organism may not be present in both fluids concurrently.69, 70 This testing can be performed on postmortem tissues even if formalin-fixed.69\n",

Although many specific diseases can result in chronic diarrhea, the actual inciting cause at the time of presentation is usually elusive. Occasionally, problems of a non-GI nature, such as hepatic disease or abdominal abscessation, result in diarrhea. More common infectious causes of chronic diarrhea include chronic salmonellosis and parasitism with large and/or small strongyles. Recently, the spirochete Brachyspira pilosicoli was implicated in a herd outbreak of chronic diarrhea in weanling age horses.87 Noninfectious inflammatory causes include inflammatory bowel diseases (granulomatous enteritis or colitis, lymphocytic-plasmacytic enterocolitis, and eosinophilic enterocolitis), neoplasia (most commonly lymphosarcoma), sand enteropathy, and right dorsal colitis. Noninflammatory causes encompass a range of problems with the common theme of disruption of the large colonic intestinal flora or mucosal function. This may or may not be related to a dietary disruption, and many of these horses have few other clinical signs. Regardless of the inciting cause, horses with chronic diarrhea remain very difficult to treat and afford a guarded prognosis for long-lasting return to normal fecal consistency.",

Frequently, recipients are pretreated with acid-suppressing agents to enhance viability of transplanted bacteria and protozoa as they pass through the gastric environment.

If fluid samples show abnormalities in TNCC and cytology, peritonitis is most likely present; enterocentesis can result in an elevated TNCC in abdominal fluid within 4 hours.106 If a differentiation between peritonitis and enterocentesis cannot be clearly made, a sample should be taken from an alternate location, preferably with ultrasound guidance. In postfoaling mares, the percentage of neutrophils in the peritoneal fluid may be increased for up to 7 days, but the total protein and TNCC should remain within normal limits.108, 109 Other parameters, if available, can aid in the diagnosis. Ultrasonographic findings of abundant hypoechoic or variably echogenic peritoneal fluid is supportive of a septic process.

Broad-spectrum coverage should be instituted pending results of peritoneal fluid culture and sensitivity. If positive results with sensitivity testing are obtained, therapy can be adjusted accordingly. A typical initial regimen includes penicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic spectrums, respectively (see Appendix D for dosages). Metronidazole should be included if anaerobic involvement is suspected because of the known resistance of multiple Bacteroides spp. to penicillins. Enrofloxacin can replace gentamicin in the treatment regimen because the lipophilic nature of this compound can provide increased penetration to the peritoneum. Neonatal foals with peritonitis should receive a similar regimen to that suggested for adults, although amikacin is frequently substituted for gentamicin due to increased sensitivity of commonly isolated organisms.111 A combination of azithromycin or clarithromycin plus rifampin provides reasonable coverage for older foals or weanlings, as Streptococcus or R. equi are commonly associated with disease in that population if a primary GI lesion is not suspected.111 Although A. equuli is typically sensitive to either penicillin or trimethoprim-sulfonamide combinations, initial broad-spectrum coverage with penicillin and gentamicin is suggested pending culture results as the result of microbial resistance of some isolates.99\n",

Hypertonic solutions should be avoided because they can result in fluid shifts into the peritoneum. The addition of povidone-iodine to a balanced solution is contraindicated since concentrations as low as 3% can induce peritoneal inflammation.114 Other agents, such as antibiotics or heparin, have also been suggested as components of the lavage solution, but data demonstrating their benefit are not currently available. Active (or closed suction) abdominal drains have also been advocated, with similar benefits and potential complications to other methods.113 Lavage with a plain isotonic solution did not alter the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin administered systemically.115 Thus alteration of antimicrobial dosing does not appear necessary if lavage with plain solutions is part of the therapeutic regimen.",
