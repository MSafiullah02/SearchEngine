Nevertheless, LncRNAs are less abundant in the cell compared to mRNAs and their expression is more specific to the cell, tissue, organ type, and to the developmental stage (Nguyen and Carninci, 2016). According to their position relative to the neighboring protein-coding gene, lncRNAs are classified as sense, antisense, bidirectional, intronic, or intergenic. In most cases, lncRNAs regulate expression of neighboring genes with whom they probably share the same enhancers, in Cis, or in Trans, if the genes are distant (Laurent et al., 2015).",

After viral entry, lncRNAs regulate genes of immune response responsible for interferon (INF) production in order to transduce signals to the immune cells for activation (Ouyang et al., 2014, Tang et al., 2017). However, viruses hijack these mechanisms by interfering with cellular lncRNAs, along with coding genes and proteins. Moreover, viral pathogens dispose of their own lncRNAs within their genome and they use them to create favorable environment to their replication and progeny (Saayman et al., 2014).

(2010) investigated lncRNAs as a response signature to viral infections using whole-transcriptome analysis of the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This study showed a differential expression of lncRNAs during SARS-CoV infection, which suggests an important role as new regulators of viral infections (Peng et al., 2010). Later, Josset et al. performed a transcriptional analysis of mouse SARS-CoV and influenza A virus (IAV) infected lungs and found 5329 differentially expressed lncRNAs. Importantly, some of these lncRNAs were found to be associated with nearby coding genes. In addition, these lncRNAs were predicted and validated to be stimulated by INF production, and therefore, they may play a key role in viral pathogenesis (Josset et al., 2014). Using microarray systems, Winterling et al. identified 42 differentially expressed lncRNAs in response to IAV infection. Among studied lncRNAs, vesicular stomatitis virus and H1N1, H3N2, H7N7 strains of IAV, induced viral-induced noncoding RNA (VIN RNA). Moreover, RNA interference knockdown of VIN RNA repressed the protein synthesis and replication of IAV (Winterling et al. 2014).

            "text": "In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zhang et al. (2013) characterized for the first time the lncRNA NEAT1 for its role in HIV-1 biology. Among 83 studied lncRNAs, NEAT1 was one of many lncRNAs that have been enhanced in expression upon HIV-1 infection (Zhang et al., 2013). Furthermore, NEAT1 has been shown to posttranscriptionally regulate HIV-1 replication through inducing paraspeckle bodies expression and the regulation of nucleus-to-cytoplasm export of Rev-dependent instability element (INS)\u2013containing HIV-1 mRNAs (Zhang et al., 2013). In addition, Saayman et al. (2014) studied an HIV-encoded lncRNA that has been previously discovered and showed that this lncRNA binds to gene promoters and suggests its function as a negative epigenetic regulator of viral transcription and a promoter of HIV latency. NRON [noncoding repressor of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells)] is another lncRNA that has been aberrantly expressed following the infection with HIV-1 and that it regulates HIV-1 replication through modulating NFAT activity (Imam et al., 2015). Moreover, HIV accessory protein, including Nef, which is an early HIV-1 protein, reduced NRON levels, resulting to viral replication, while the late protein Vpu increased its levels and thus promote HIV viral latency (Imam et al., 2015). Another mechanism of NRON-mediated latency of HIV was proposed by Li et al. (2016); they suggest that NRON is involved in inhibiting viral transcription through directing tat protein to the ubiquitin/proteasome components (CUL4B and PSMD11) resulting in its degradation. Several other lncRNAs have been reported for their putative roles in regulating HIV viral life cycle. To study the different expression patterns of lncRNA during viral life cycle, Trypsteen et al. (2016) performed a transcriptome profiling during HIV integration, reverse transcription, and HIV particle production. They also investigated the roles of these lncRNAs and found their involvement in different pathways of cell cycle regulation including responses to DNA damage, apoptosis, and proteasomal and ubiquitination pathways (Trypsteen et al., 2016). In addition, several lncRNAs have been reported to regulate gene expression through their interaction with chromatin modifying complexes, especially the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) that directs methylation marks to the promoters of targeted genes. Similarly, lncRNA ASP RNA was reported to interact with PRC2 at the HIV-1 5\u2032LTR region and results in H3K27me3 mark accumulation (Zapata et al., 2017). Along with these findings, ASP RNA reduced RNA polymerase II expression (Zapata et al., 2017). As a result, HIV-1 replication is repressed and its latency is established and maintained (Zapata et al., 2017). More recently, Postlera et al. used a metaanalytic approach to investigate differentially expressed lncRNAs during HIV-1 infection. One of the identified lncRNAs was proposed to be a regulator of cytokines regulation in T cells (Postler et al., 2017).",

During KSHV infection, a 1.1 kb long ncRNA PAN is produced in the early stages and accumulates in the nucleus. In fact, PAN RNA expression represents 80% of the total polyadenylated transcripts produced in the lytic phase by both infected cells and KSHV, which suggest an important role in latent to lytic phase transition of the virus (Borah et al., 2012). KSHV recruit several molecules in order to activate the expression of its own transcripts and the shutdown of host RNAs expression; these include ORF50 and ORF57 proteins that modulate viral gene expression and RNA processing. ORF57 interacts with PAN RNA and enhances its accumulation. ORF57 is also found to maintain PAN RNA stability in the absence of ENE elements through binding to a 9 nt motif contained in an element called MRE (Mta responsive element) located at the 5\u2032 region of PAN. In addition, MRE element interacts with other proteins as E1B-AP5 and poly(A)-binding protein C1 (PABPC1) (Massimelli et al., 2011). Coherent with these findings, PAN RNA was also found to interact in the nucleus with PABPC1. PABPC1 is a protein located in the cytoplasm of the infected host cells and responsible for modulating mRNA translation, maintaining their stability and processing. During lytic phase of KSHV infection, SOX protein induces PAN RNA expression and PABPC1 relocation to the nucleus which is required for the expression of late KSHV gene, such as vIL-6 and k8.1 (Borah et al., 2011). Later, Massimelli further investigated the interaction relating PAN RNA to PABPC1 and ORF57 and found that PABPC1 actually suppresses PAN RNA expression and that ORF57 targets PABPC1 to enhance PAN RNA accumulation (Massimelli et al., 2013).",

            "text": "In fact, PAN RNA promotes the transition of KSHV infection from latent to lytic state through its interaction with the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). LANA is important to maintain viral latency through inhibiting the expression of lytic genes. During latency, LANA is associate with a large portion of the KSHV episomes, while during reactivation, high levels of PAN RNA are transcribed to block LANAs interaction sites and induce its disassociation of LANA from KSHV episome, thus promoting viral gene expression (Campbell et al., 2014). The mechanism underlying PAN RNA regulation of viral gene expression appears to involve epigenetic pathways as well. PAN can bind promoters of viral genes and activate their expression such as the lytic regulator Rta, the demethylases JMJD3 (Jumonji domain containing 3) and UTX (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome) and histone methyltransferase MLL2 (mixed-lineage leukemia protein 2) to induce the removal of the H3K27me3 mark and mark it to be activated. PAN RNA can also act as a repressor by interacting with SUZ12 (suppressor of zeste 12) and EZH2 (enhancer of zeste 2) which are components of the repressive PRC2 complex (polycomb repressive complex 2) and mediate the trimethylation of H3K27.

In addition, two other nuclear lncRNAs, oriPtLs and oriPtRs, are transcribed during EBV reactivation and contribute to the viral gene expression and evasion of the host immune response (Cao et al., 2015). LOC553103 is another lncRNA that is associated with EBV-related cancer as it is responsible for promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. This lncRNA is regulated by a miRNA EBV-miR-BART6-3p (He et al., 2016). In a study on lymphoblastoid cell line, lncRNA profiling showed different patterns of expression of H19, H19 antisense, 7SL, and p53 mRNA. These are also released in the exosomes. Huang et al. used RNA-Seq and identified five lncRNAs with specific expression patterns to EBV-associated gastric cancer. Among these, SNHG8 showed interactions with several EBV proteins such as LF3, BHLF1, BHRF1, and BNLF2a and interacted with genes and pathways targeted by EBV such as transcription and mRNA metabolism (Huang et al., 2016).",

(2010) correlated the expression levels of lncRNAs to the host antiviral immune response and suggested that lncRNAs may regulate immunity through their association with chromatin modifying complexes and the modulation of neighboring genes expression. Further studies were conducted to better understand this regulation. For example, Ouyang et al. showed that LncRNA NRAV negatively regulates INF-stimulated genes (ISGs) through a mechanism that appears to involve histone modification. During IAV infection, infected host downregulates lncRNA NRAV to allow ISGs production and repress viral replication (Ouyang et al., 2014). In addition, Barriocanal et al. reported that two lncRNAs, lncISG15, and lncBST2/BISPR, were induced by INF production during IAV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, along with other ISGs such as BST2, IRF1, and ISG15. They found that LncBST2 positively regulates BST2/Tetherin, which have influence on INF release. On the other hand, Kambara et al. (2014) found that lncRNA-CMPK2 was actively upregulated after INF treatment and negatively regulates transcription of ISGs and they proposed a mechanism of this repression that involves RNA\u2013protein interactions with chromatin modifying complexes or transcription factors. The negative regulation of IFN is important to maintain their controlled production and prevent inflammatory damage to the host (Fig. 6.1\n).",

SFPQ, a component of paraspeckles, binds to IL-8 gene promoter and represses its transcription. Imamura et al. (2014) found that NEAT1 activates IL-8 expression through a mechanism involving paraspeckles, as this lncRNA interacts with SFPQ and relocates it back to the paraspeckle, away from IL-8 promoter, which activates the expression of this cytokine. Recent findings indicate that NEAT1 employs the same mechanism and remove SFPQ from gene promoter to activate RIG-I expression and thus producing INFs (Ma et al., 2017a, Ma et al., 2017b). Morchikh et al. further studied the role of NEAT1 in the regulation of immune system. In fact, they indicated NEAT1, in complex with HEXIM1, which is required for the assembly of HDP-RNP subunits composed of HEXIM1, DNA-PK, and paraspeckles. Subsequently, the HDP\u2013PNP complex interacts with cGAS and PQBP1 to mediate immune response to pathogens (Morchikh et al., 2017).",

Moreover, HCV appears to activate proviral lncRNAs within their host. HCV induces the upregulation of lncRNA EGOT, also known as CSR32. Depletion of EGOT reduced viral replication by producing ISGs. In fact, many CSRs are upregulated upon HCV infection and development of liver cancer, which demonstrate that HCV employs cellular lncRNA EGOT to repress immunity and promote cell proliferation (Carnero et al., 2016).",

Thus knowing that viral genome is limited in length, viral encoded noncoding transcripts must play important roles for maintaining their life cycle and producing new progeny. Moreover, RNAs, especially lncRNAs, are more able to evade host immunity compared to protein elements. Therefore viruses might preferably employ these noncoding molecules to invade their hosts (Ding et al., 2016). Consistent with this hypothesis, Moon et al. found that flaviviruses encoded a lncRNA, referred to as sfRNA. This viral encoded lncRNA represses antiviral immune response through its interaction with RNA interference machinery, used by the host to degrade viral RNAs. Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, they found an interaction of sfRNA with the RNase Dicer and Ago2, which are important players of RNA interference.",

Further validation with qRT-PCR confirmed the significant overexpression of LINC01419 in HCC with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV etiology compared to normal liver tissues (Zhang et al., 2015). Later, changes in expression levels of eight lncRNAs were significantly related to HCC compared to adjacent normal tissues.

They further found improved sensitivity when combining the studied lncRNAs expression with serum alpha-fetoprotein level (Kamel et al., 2016). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is also induced by HCV. Using qRT-PCR, elevated levels of lncRNA-AF085935 in sera of HCV-induced RA patients were reported, suggesting lncRNA-AF085935 as candidate biomarker for early detection of HCV-related RA (Sabry et al., 2017). Another lncRNA, referred to as ncRNA-HEIH, is expressed in a different manner in sera and exosomes during HCV infection and is proposed as an indicator of HCC.
