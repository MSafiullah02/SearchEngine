There is a risk of donor to recipient transmission of COVID-19, both from deceased donors and living donors. The risk of donor-derived infection would depend upon donor exposure, infectivity in the incubation period, degree and duration of viremia, and viability of the virus within blood or specific organ compartments [7].",

Whether COVID-19 can be transmitted parenterally is not known, nevertheless, screening of all blood donors should be done. Preventing transmission from an infected patient to a healthcare worker and vice versa is of great importance. Current recommendations are for both droplet and airborne precautions for infection control in the hospital setting. In general, for the society emphasis should be given on recommended preventive measures against COVID-19 namely social distancing, frequent hand washing, cleaning frequently touched surfaces, following cough etiquettes, etc.",

To minimise the risk of COVID-19 exposure in the hospital setting, it was decided that liver transplant will be done judiciously as per the following criteria:Moratorium on all non-urgent transplants till April 14, 2020 (which is likely to change as per the evolving situation of COVID-19 in India).Acute liver failure (ALF)\u2014can be done as usual after medical therapy has failed. Standard indications for patient selection in ALF to be followed.Acute on Chronic Liver failure (ACLF with organ failure\u2014decision for transplantation should be based on individual centre's discretion. Standard indications for patient selection in ACLF to be followed.B.Deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT).Elective DDLT should be done only if donor is COVID-19 negative, and recipient is from the same city. Air travel should be avoided. However, with current National lockdown and a ban on both domestic and international travel, DDLT will need to be limited to the same city.C.Living donor liver transplant (LDLT).LDLT should be done for urgent cases after thorough counselling as LDLT imposes a risk on the healthy donor with hospital admission. LDLT also exposes the various potential donors who may need to be screened with the intent of liver donation.D.Testing for COVID-19.All donors (deceased and living donor) and recipients should be tested for COVID-19 at the time of urgent transplant. The testing should be done as per standard guidelines by the individual centres, and from approved laboratories. It is expected that the turnaround time for the test will be reduced shortly.E.Immunosuppression strategy.Although there is a concern that organ transplant patients may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, there is no evidence as of now to modify the immunosuppression protocol. Standard immunosuppression should be followed in the post-transplant period till further data is available.F.Follow up post-transplant.Patients should follow up with their respective centres as usual. It is strongly encouraged that patient should avoid hospital visits for routine follow up and consult online via telemedicine.However, those patients with post-transplant emergencies should attend hospital as usual and should be provided with necessary standard care by the transplant team.Recipients with symptoms such as fever, cough and breathing difficulty should be evaluated for suspected COVID-19 infection as per the national guidelines.G.Care of sick recipients on waitlist.The management of recipients for various medical complications to be continued in the hospital, including ICU admissions.H.Prophylactic medications for COVID-19.At present, there is no recommendation for prophylactic medications or vaccinations for transplant patients. However, newer medications against COVID-19 are likely to be available soon.I.Advisory for transplant recipients for COVID-19.All transplant recipients should be sent an advisory from the respective transplant centre regarding various do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for the prevention of COVID-19 infection.J.Testing of transplant professionals.This should be done selectively if there has been a positive case of COVID-19 in the concerned hospital.",
