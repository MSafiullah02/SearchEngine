Patients with SARS-CoV infection in phase 2 or 3 of the disease develop autoantibodies against human pulmonary epithelial cells and endothelial cells, and these antibodies can mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity.23 This phenomenon may derive from cryptic autoantigens exposed on damaged cells or presented by phagocytes that infiltrated the area surrounding the lesion, and could cause further post-infectious cell damage through apoptosis and complement-mediated cytotoxicity.",

In an ex vivo test in which microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) were incubated with serum from aHUS or TTP patients or healthy controls, aHUS or TTP serum, but not control serum, induced intense C5b-9 deposits.55\n,\n56 When the cell monolayer, pre-exposed to aHUS or TTP serum, was perfused in a flow-chamber with normal whole blood, massive thrombus formation occurred.57 Thrombus formation was completely normalised by adding, to aHUS or TTP serum, the humanised monoclonal anti-C5 eculizumab that blocks C5 cleavage, thus preventing the formation of C5a and C5b-9. A C5aR antagonist significantly reduced but did not fully normalise the thrombus area induced by TTP serum,57 demonstrating that both terminal complement products, C5a and C5b-9, play a role in the loss of endothelial anti-thrombogenic properties.",

SARS-CoV-2 initially infects the lungs, where it replicates and causes cytolysis of alveolar cells and inflammatory burst, diminishing oxygen uptake. But the virus can injure many other organs. Kidney dysfunction is common in patients with severe forms of COVID-19 and is an important risk factor of death. SARS-CoV-2 may bind directly to ACE2 expressed on kidney cells, cause cell injury and activate the inflammatory response and the complement cascade locally (grey box). Kidney damage and dysfunction may also derive from drug nephrotoxicity or systemic events like poor blood oxygenation, lowered blood pressure or cytokine storms (orange box).",

The classical pathway is activated by the binding of natural IgM or induced IgG antibodies, which form immune complexes with viral antigens, to the C1 complex, comprising C1q, C1r and C1s molecules. The lectin pathway is triggered by the binding of mannose binding lectin (MBL) with SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, which leads to the activation of MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2). The classical and lectin pathways converge into the cleavage of complement components C2 and C4, leading to the formation of the C3 convertase (C4bC2a) of the classical/lectin pathways. The alternative pathway is continuously activated in plasma by low-grade hydrolysis (tick-over) of C3 that forms C3(H2O). The latter binds to factor B (FB), which in turn is cleaved by factor D (FD) to form the alternative pathway fluid-phase initiation C3 convertase. The C3 convertases cleave C3 into C3a, an anaphylotoxin, and C3b, which deposits on cell surfaces. C3b produced by any of the three pathways contributes to the formation of the alternative pathway amplification C3 convertase, which cleaves additional C3 molecules, resulting in an amplification loop.",
