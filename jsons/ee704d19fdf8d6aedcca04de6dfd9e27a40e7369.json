To break the chain of spreading, Government announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24th 2020, which is increased two times. The Ongoing lockdown 3.0 is over on May 18th, 2020. We derived how the lockdown relaxation is going to impact on containment of the outbreak. Here the Exponential Growth Model has been used to derive the epidemic curve based on the data collected from February 11th 2020, to May 11th 2020, and the Machine Learning based Linear Regression model that gives the epidemic curve to predict the cases with the continuous flow of the lockdown. We estimate that if the lockdown is continuing with more relaxation, then the estimated infected cases reach up to 1.16 crores by June 30th 2020, and the lockdown would persist with current restriction, then the expected predicted infected cases are 5.69 lacs. The Exponential Growth Model and the Linear Regression Model are advantageous to predict the number of affected cases of COVID-19. These models can be used for forecasting in long term intervals. It shows from our result that lockdown with certain restriction has a vital role in preventing the spreading of this epidemic in this current situation.",

The first case was reported as unidentified pneumonia in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in late December 2019 [2] , which later detected as coronavirus. WHO was later on March 11 th 2020, framed it as Pandemic [1] . Then as time flows, the number of coronavirus victims spread exponentially. WHO named this novel coronavirus as \"COVID-19\" on February 11 th 2020 [3] .",

The spreading of the virus to enter into our body can be stopped by regular hand wash with alcohol-based hand rub or wash with soap and water, maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) of social-distance, avoid touching eyes, nose, face [9] . The essential measures should be taken by Government to perpetrate social-distancing. Lockdown plays a crucial role in breaking the rapid spreading of this virus. It provides restrictions on goods transportations, closing or minimizing the travel connections from different parts of the country, closing the public place, tourist spots, vending zones, cultural activities plays a crucial role in disrupting the spreading of this deadly disease.

In the worst case, all the possible number of people infected. After that, the curve has to be flattened. So, in the epidemic, the exponential growth model follows the path of a logistic curve. It increases until the inflation point. At the inflation point, the growth rate becomes 1, and the derivative becomes 0. After the inflation point, the growth factor may be less than 0, and the derivative is negative. And when the growth factor tends to 0, the line flattens.

To overcome the first challenge, we resample the data by taking the Interquartile Range (IQR range) [25% to 75%] and find the growth factor. To address the second problem, we create polynomial features with the help of sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures. The 3rd problem is predicting with 90 samples not suitable for machine learning. However, we test with 20% of the dataset 21 samples and achieve 99.89% accuracy in regression and r2 score of 90.78% in the exponential model as shown in Figure-4 .

Earlier, we have cleared that the lockdown is the higher impactable precaution measure that has been taken in different countries of the world. The lockdown not only maintains social-distancing but also gives some safe time for the agencies to increase the preventive measure tools, kits, and make more tests.
