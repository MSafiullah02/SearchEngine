Palivizumab (100 \u03bcg/mL) in PBS 0.1% Tween with 0.5% human serum albumin served as a negative control. All serum samples obtained from SARS-infected hamsters were heat-inactivated for 90 min at 56\u00b0C to inactivate SARS-CoV, and all dilutions (3-fold) were made in PBS 0.1% Tween 0.5% human serum albumin. Plates were washed with PBS 0.05% Tween. The limits of detection are reported as <0.4 \u03bcg/mL and are based on the highest concentration tested (dilution, 1:100 or 1:200) and the limit of quantitation of the assay (\u223c2 ng/mL).

These data are not included in statistical evaluations of the efficacy of MAb 201 treatment in the reduction of the severity SARS-CoV\u2013associated pathological findings. In experiments 2 and 3, tissues were coded before histopathological examination and were decoded before statistical analyses. Pathological lesions were classified as follows: (1) interstitial pneumonitis was defined by the presence of inflammation in the interalveolar walls and around the bronchioles, and (2) consolidation was defined by the presence of intra-alveolar inflammation and reactive proliferation of cuboidal epithelial cells in the alveolar walls. Pathological lesions were not observed or ranged in severity from mild to severe, and a grade of 0\u20133 was assigned, as described below, for statistical evaluation. Interstitial pneumonitis and consolidation were graded independently, according to the extent of their severity, as is shown in figure 1. A grade of 0 indicated that no interstitial pneumonitis or consolidation was found. A grade of 1 (mild) denoted the presence of scattered, single foci of either interstitial pneumonitis or consolidation that did not involve >15\u201320 alveoli; a grade of 2 (moderately severe) denoted the presence of multiple areas where there was confluence of 2 foci of interstitial pneumonitis or consolidation; and a grade of 3 (severe) denoted the presence of large, confluent areas of interstitial pneumonitis or consolidation that involved more than half a lobe",

Within any single treatment group (4 mg/kg MAb 201, 40 mg/kg MAb 201, or the control treatment), no noticeable difference was observed in the levels of viral replication in the pulmonary tissues between 3 and 5 days after infection (P>.05). Therefore, data from days 3 and 5 after infection were combined and are presented, according to corresponding treatment groups, in tables 1 and 2. However, we did note significant differences in the virus levels in the lungs and in the degree of associated pathological findings in MAb 201\u2013treated hamsters, compared with those in control hamsters (table 1, experiment 1). In the group treated with 4 mg/kg MAb 201, only 2 of 6 hamsters achieved measurable titers of neutralizing antibody and IgG ELISA antibodies after intraperitoneal administration of the treatment. The number of hamsters in this group was therefore too small for relevant statistical analysis to be done. Of the 6 hamsters in the group treated with 40 mg/kg MAb 201, 5 had measurable titers of neutralizing and IgG ELISA antibodies. In a comparison of this group with the control group (n=6), statistically significant reductions in the virus levels were achieved with MAb 201 treatment (P=.04, Mann-Whitney U test). Furthermore, histopathological findings suggested that treatment with MAb 201 administered 24 h after SARS-CoV infection reduced the severity of interstitial pneumonitis observed 3 and 5 days after SARS-CoV infection, as well as the severity of consolidation observed 5 days after infection (data not shown)",

As in previous experiments, the reduction in the severity of associated pathological findings was remarkable in the hamsters treated with MAb 201 (table 2, experiment 3).

The few cases of SARS that occurred during 2004 were limited to individuals who were exposed to SARS-CoV in laboratories and persons who came in contact with these individuals. Vaccination of laboratory workers could be a strategy to prevent infections, if an efficacious SARS vaccine were available. However, in the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, a variety of interventions are desirable. If SARS were to recur, we may be best served by a combination of SARS-specific vaccines, drugs, and immunotherapies. Identification of SARS-CoV as the causative agent in an outbreak of respiratory disease might take 2 to several days, and it could take up to a few weeks after vaccination for protective immunity to develop. In these instances, individuals at greatest risk for infection (i.e., health care workers) and disease (i.e., elderly individuals) could be offered MAbs that could serve as prevention or treatment if exact exposure status were unknown. Also, depending on the nature of any future vaccine (e.g., live, attenuated viral vectors) and on the immune status of individuals considered to be at risk, treatment with MAbs or antiviral drugs may be preferred to vaccination",

Systemic absorption of antibody from the peritoneum of hamsters was demonstrated by measuring serum neutralizing antibody titers 24 h after treatment with MAbs. In several of the hamsters treated with MAbs and, most notably, in hamsters that received lower doses of MAbs (4 or 10 mg/kg), SARS-specific neutralizing antibodies were undetectable in the serum 24 h after treatment. This may be explained by incomplete delivery of MAbs to the peritoneum, by delivery of MAbs to the gut, or, possibly, by loss of some of the antibody through leaking along the needle track. In several of these hamsters with subneutralizing anti\u2013SARS-CoV antibody levels, reductions in the viral burden in the lungs and the severity of associated pathological findings were still observed (tables 1 and 2, \u201cMAb 201 subneut.\u201d groups, compared with controls). Perhaps more importantly, in hamsters with subneutralizing levels of anti\u2013SARS-CoV antibodies, enhancement of disease severity was not observed (i.e., viral titers and associated pathological findings were not greater than those noted for control hamsters [tables 1 and 2, as well as unpublished data from experiment 3, for hamsters treated with 10 mg/kg MAb 201])",

            "text": "Another challenge in demonstrating effective immunotherapy for SARS-infected animals is that the course and kinetics of infection and disease are abbreviated in all animal models reported to date [21, 24\u201328\n], compared with the course of SARS in humans [7]. For instance, the hamster model supports early viral replication, which peaks at 2\u20133 days after infection. Viral replication and severe pathological findings persist in the lower respiratory tract for \u223c7 days, after which time they begin to clear. By 14 days after infection, little to no histopathological evidence of inflammation or disease persists, and virus is rarely detected in the upper respiratory tract [21]. Clinical symptoms are not observed beyond the first week after administration of virus in other animal models that demonstrate clinical signs of illness, including aged BALB/c mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates, and infectious virus can no longer be recovered in respiratory tissues after this time. These observations are in contrast to the relatively prolonged course of infection associated with SARS cases in humans, for which the incubation period for SARS-CoV is 2\u201310 days. The peak viral load has been reported to occur \u223c7 [29] to 10 [30] days after the onset of illness, with peak severity of interstitial pneumonitis occurring a few days later, at 6\u201313 days (median, 10.5 days) after the onset of illness [29]. Clinical findings may persist well into the second and third week after infection. In experiment 2, we treated an additional 3 hamsters with 40 mg/kg MAb 201 2 days after SARS-CoV infection, at the time that peak viral titers were observed in the lungs [21], and the lungs of these animals were harvested for histopathological analysis 5 days after infection. Even at this later point in time, the severity of associated pathological findings was reduced in hamsters treated with MAb 201. These hamsters, similar to those treated 1 day after infection, had mild interstitial pneumonitis and moderately severe consolidation. Taking into account these limited observations in hamsters, as well as the longer period from initial exposure of SARS-CoV to the development of clinical symptoms of SARS in humans, suggests that the window for the initiation of MAb immunotherapy in human populations exposed to SARS-CoV may be much longer than that indicated by the 24-h window for postexposure treatment used in these studies involving hamsters. MAb 201 has now been shown to have prophylactic and therapeutic potential for SARS-CoV infections in 2 animal models, and these data provide the basis for phase 1 clinical trials of MAb 201 in humans",
