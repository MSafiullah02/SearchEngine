Several viruses encode at least one protein displaying ion channel (IC) activity. These proteins are known as viroporins, the term being first proposed when it was observed that several proteins involved in virus-promoted cell membrane permeabilization shared common characteristics [1]. The list of identified viroporins is constantly growing, especially in RNA viruses [2], [3]. Thus, the M2 of influenza virus (IFV) [4], [5], [6], [7], the p7 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], the vpu of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], and the poliovirus (PV) 2B [18], [19], [20], [21] proteins are only some members of this list found in prominent human pathogens. Accordingly, viroporin activity blocking by specific inhibitors, and viroporin-defective live attenuated vaccines offer new therapy approaches to treat and prevent viral infection, which reinforces the importance of investigating these proteins [2].",

They usually contain one (class I) or two (class II) \u03b1-helices long enough to transverse the lipid bilayer [2], [22]. These features enable viroporin insertion and oligomerization in cell membranes forming ion conductive pores, which alters the cell permeability allowing the transport of ions and other small molecules. The IC activity of these proteins is expected to be involved in virus entry, trafficking, morphogenesis and maturation [23], [24]. In fact, research work supports the relevance of the IC activities of IFV M2 [25], [26], [27], [28], HCV p7 [29], [30], [31], or SARS-CoV E [32] proteins in virulence and pathogenesis.",

However, in some particular cases like IFV M2 and HCV p7, they can form highly selective channels displaying specificity for physiologically relevant cations [4], [5], [6], [7], [33], [34]. Given the varied functions ascribed to viroporins and the various cell environments sampled by these products, it is not unlikely that different functional structures can emerge at different stages of the viral cycle. One consequence of this functional diversity is the possibility that depending on the conditions of the lipid bilayer the same viroporin may have the potential either to establish nanometer-sized ion channels, or alternatively, participate in additional membrane permeabilization mechanisms allowing the transport of larger solutes exceeding the nanometer scale [35], [36].",

However, studies addressing in parallel and systematically (i.e., using same lipid compositions and assessing dependence of these activities on the same regulatory factors) planar membrane electrophysiology vs. vesicle permeability assays for the same viroporin are missing. Here, to carry out such a comparative assessment, we have taken the advantage that CSFV-p7-induced release of ANTS from lipid vesicles mimicking the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) membrane is subject to pH, lipid composition and amino acid sequence regulation [38]. Thus, we have first established IC activity of CSFV-p7 in ER-like lipid planar bilayers and then analyzed its dependence on the same factors.",

Each hydrophobic domain is additionally intervened by a short loop with polar character, a feature also shared by integral membrane proteins that assemble into helical oligomers [22]. CSFV-p7 induces ANTS release from liposomes, a process that requires acid pH and evolves more efficiently in ER-like membranes [38], [42]. The pore-forming activity and its regulation by pH and lipid composition can be recreated by the p7C peptide, representing the C-terminal domain including the TM1\u2013TM2 connecting basic loop (Fig. 1). In order to improve the topological localization of the viroporin activity, p7-4, a TM2-based peptide lacking the basic loop, was designed. Interestingly, p7-4 also induces ANTS release from liposomes, but the process does not require acid pH and it is not inhibited by classic viroporin inhibitors [42]. These previous results could indicate that the TM1\u2013TM2 connecting loop is essential for the CSFV-p7 activity regulation. Up to date, CSFV-p7 full protein and its constituent domains have been shown to participate in the permeabilization of lipid vesicles [38], but electrophysiological measurements investigating their pore-formation mechanisms at the single channel level are missing.",

By selecting this control mixture, it was not our intention to analyze the effects of cholesterol on channel activity (this would require thorough analysis, which was beyond the scope of the present work), but rather to test the absence of the anionic phospholipid PI. In fact, similar results were obtained in the absence of cholesterol using PC:PE (7:3 molar ratio) planar bilayers (data not shown).",

Thus, to map IC activity, CSFV p7 sequence-based peptides were synthesized and analyzed in planar bilayers resembling ER composition. As displayed in the diagram of Fig. 1, p7N and p7C sequences spanned the potential N- and C-terminal TM1 and TM2 regions of CSFV p7, respectively, and overlapped along the conserved polar loop sequence [38]. In the case of p7-4, the sequence was selected to span the hydrophobic C-terminal TM2 of CSFV p7. The resulting sequence was long enough to transverse the membrane, although interrupted by the turn-promoting 49MTNNPVK55 polar sequence. The pore-forming activities of these peptides were assessed in artificial lipid bilayers, as shown in Fig. 4A. Both p7C and p7-4 peptides exhibited substantial IC activity, in agreement with the high values of leakage induced by these peptides in LUVs. In contrast, p7N showed almost null currents both in electrophysiological recordings and in LUVs. These data confirm a similar dependence of vesicle permeabilization and IC activities on the C-terminal helix of CSFV-p7.",

On the one side, p7C performs like the full CSFV p7 protein both in LUVs and in electrophysiological recordings (Fig. 5A). On the other side p7-4 shows a distinctive feature in ER membranes. Increasing pH does not inhibit the ability of p7-4 to induce membrane permeabilization (Fig. 5B). This seems a particular characteristic of ER membranes, because PI lacking control membranes show in both peptide samples very low currents at pH 5. The ANTS leakage induced by p7-4 also shows a significant reduction under these conditions as compared to PI-containing samples. Although the reduction in leakage is not so marked, once again, the correlation between planar electrophysiology and LUVs is maintained supporting our finding that in the absence of the 33MRDEPI38 turn, pores could be efficiently formed, but their activity was not pH dependent. Thus, the short interhelical loop presents a regulatory function and determines the sensibility to pH changes.",

As could be expected, [46], [47] the effect of the lipid charge in the channel function is remarkable: a decrease in the PI content (6:3:1 and 5:4:1 ratios) enhances a defined second peak in the histogram centered at 15 pA, which comprises current values that triplicate those of the main peak centered at 5 pA. In contrast, the excess of PI (3:3:4) yields a huge dispersion with no clearly defined maximum. On the other hand, altering the intrinsic curvature of the monolayer by including an excess of PE (3:6:1) leads to a single well-defined maximum at 5 pA. This is probably related to the fact that lipids with intrinsic negative curvature, like PE, restrict the formation of protein\u2013lipid combined structures because of the energy penalty involved in the bending of the bilayer leaflet [48]. Notably, the intermediate composition (5:4:1) containing low PI and almost equimolar PC:PE ratio leads to the best definition of the 5 and 15 peaks in the histogram.",

In the presence of a concentration gradient between both sides of the membrane, there is a net flux of ions through membrane pores and hence an electric current is measured. The applied voltage that is needed to make zero the electric current (the so-called reversal potential, Erev) reveals the preferential passage of either positive or negative ions. In the experimental protocol used here (see the Materials and methods section), a positive applied potential means that the pore is selective to cations and a negative one is associated to an anionic selectivity. We performed reversal potential experiments at pH 5.0 under a concentration ratio of 5 (Ccis\n = 150 mM KCl, Ctrans\n = 750 mM KCl) or 10 (Ccis\n = 150 mM KCl, Ctrans\n = 1.5 M KCl). Fig. 8 shows the permeability ratio (P+/P\u2212) distribution from performed reversal potential experiments. P+/P\u2212\n > 1 values are tied to a cationic selectivity whereas lower than 1 values indicate a preference for anions. We see two different groups of values, one connected to a very weak anionic selectivity and other to a cationic one. Note that a cluster of identical small structures displaying a higher conductance would yield the same reversal potential as any of its constituents, not a different value with opposite sign. However, the reason for opposite selectivity in each type of pores remains unclear. This lipid dependence of CSFV p7 protein channel activity resembles that reported for the HCV p7 protein [49] although there are some differences regarding the lipid compositions explored, the sub-conductance states and the cationic selectivity found in that case.",

In the case of CSFV p7, minimal changes in either the lipid charge or the intrinsic lipid curvature originates dramatic changes in the current histograms. The lack of structural information about CSFV-p7 viroporin makes difficult even a qualitative explanation of the lipid regulation the IC activity. The combined analysis of current traces and selectivity experiments indicates that different current states would probably correspond to, at least, two different independent pore structures.",
