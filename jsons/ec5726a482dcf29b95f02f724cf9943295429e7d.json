Dysregulated host immune response in the lung is a key 37 feature in ARDS pathophysiology. However, cellular actors in Covid-19-driven ARDS are 38 poorly understood. Here, we dynamically analyzed the biology of innate T cells, a 39 heterogeneous class (MAIT, \u03b3\u03b4T and iNKT cells) of T lymphocytes, presenting potent anti-40 infective and regulatory functions. Patients presented a compartmentalized lung inflammation 41 paralleled with a limited systemic inflammation.

Thus, patients present an altered innate T cell 47 biology that may account for the dysregulated immune response observed in Covid-19-related 48 acute respiratory distress syndrome. : medRxiv preprint 69 In December 2019 were first reported in Wuhan, China, pneumonia cases due to a coronavirus, 70 the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel strain related 71 to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, responsible for recent outbreaks. Disease presentation related 72 with SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus disease, Covid-19), can vary from mild disease to life-73 threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is caused by a sustained and 74 dysregulated immune response triggered in the lung after initial insult, resulting in alteration of 75 alveolar-capillary membrane permeability and perturbed tissue repair 1 . This pathological 76 process leads to interstitial and alveolar oedema that profoundly impairs gas exchange. 77 However, the cellular and molecular factors that are responsible for this aberrant and persistent 78 inflammatory response are poorly understood 2 . In SARS-CoV infection, delayed type I IFN 79 response together with high viral loads were associated with defective adaptive response and 80 exaggerated tissue damage 3 . During severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, elevated pro-inflammatory 81 cytokines levels (e.g. IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) were associated with more severe cases, supporting an 82 inflammatory hypothesis 4-6 . In addition, T cell lymphopenia has been correlated with disease 83 severity suggesting a role for these cells in the pathophysiology of severe Covid-19 5,6 . Besides 84 classical adaptative CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, the T cell compartment comprises several lineages 85 of cells endowed with both innate and adaptive properties that are referred to as unconventional 86 or innate T cells (iT cells) 7 . This heterogeneous class of T cells comprises three main lineages 87 including Mucosal-Associated Invariant T (MAIT), \u03b3\u03b4T and invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) 88 cells. They are restricted to quasi-monomorphic non-classical major histocompatibility 89 complex and have emerged as key players in mucosal immunity and inflammatory response 8-90 11 . Given their versatile functions, iT cells emerge as interesting targets in the context of Covid-91 19-driven ARDS. First, iT cells mainly populate mucosal tissues including the lung and have 92 the ability to promptly produce substantial amounts of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 93 and IL-17A, two key cytokines in anti-infective response at barrier sites. Moreover, iT cells can 94 fine-tune the intensity and flavour of the host immune response shaping the magnitude of the 95 adaptive response. They can also participate in the process of the resolution of inflammation 96",

Detailed analysis of circulating iT cells within total 173 T lymphocytes indicated a profound decrease in MAIT (~ 6-fold) and iNKT (~ 7-fold) relative 174 proportions in critically ill Covid-19 patients (Figure 2A ) despite some comorbidities such as 175 obesity and/or diabetes can also partly contribute to this observation 17, 18 . In the meantime, the 176 relative proportion of \u03b3\u03b4T cells remained unchanged (Figure 2A) . However, by focusing on 177 subsets based on TCR repertoire, we observed that the frequency of V\u03b42 + was slightly decreased 178 while the V\u03b41\u03b42cells were increased (Figure 2A) . Of note, no significant differences could be 179 observed for the V\u03b41 + subset (Figure 2A) . This may indicate a particular contribution of this 180 \u03b3\u03b4T subset -likely V\u03b43 + -during Covid-19 as suggested in other viral infections 18 .",
