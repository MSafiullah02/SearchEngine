A new strain of H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu was confirmed in the UK in May 2009 and has spread to over 100 countries around the world causing the World Health Organization to declare a global flu pandemic.

The results from these studies were similar and are therefore reported together in this review. The studies were of variable quality. Few were based on an explicit theoretical framework (N \u00bc 3). Nearly, all (N \u00bc 24) were cross-sectional in design. Few studies examined the mediating role of attitudes and beliefs in the relationship between demographic factors and behaviour (N \u00bc 3). Most studies concentrated on factors associated with carrying out preventive behaviours (N \u00bc 22) rather than avoidant (N \u00bc 13) or management of disease behaviours (N \u00bc 10). 1 This review investigates the influence of demographic and psychological variables on protective behaviours that are key to reducing the spread and impact of pandemic influenza.

The behaviours included hand washing, respiratory hygiene, mask wearing, using utensils, and washing after touching contaminated surfaces. An Internet survey carried out during the beginning of the H1N1 swine flu outbreak found that older age was associated with more frequent hand washing ( Jones & Salathe, 2009) . Older people are more likely to say they intend to be vaccinated against influenza during an outbreak of SARS (Hong & Collins, 2006) . Older people have also been found to be more likely to report that they would take self-protective behaviours in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza (Lau, Kim, Tsui, & Griffiths, 2007a) or an influenza pandemic in the future (Barr et al., 2008) . Research by Barr et al. (2008) may explain the association between older age and behaviour in that they found that older people feel more susceptible to being affected by a possible influenza pandemic. In the context of the threat of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the pattern of results for age was different, with people aged 18-24 more likely to follow recommended behaviours (hand washing more, cleaning surfaces more, and having plans for a flu friend 2 ) than older people (Rubin, Aml\u00f4t, Page, & Wessely, 2009) . A cross-sectional study of adolescents in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak found that younger adolescents were more likely to report mask wearing .",

This result was also found in a longitudinal study carried out in Hong Kong (Leung et al., 2005) . In the UK, women were also more likely than men to follow recommended behaviours in the face of a swine flu pandemic (hand washing more, cleaning surfaces more, and having plans for a flu friend; Rubin et al., 2009) . In addition, an Internet survey found that women were more likely than men to report increased hand-washing at the beginning of the swine flu pandemic (Jones & Salathe, 2009 ). This association between gender and behaviour may be because women have been found to perceive themselves as more susceptible, for example to SARS, than men do (Brug et al., 2004) . In contrast, there were no gender differences found in one Australian study for intentions to wear a mask (Barr et al., 2008) or actual face mask use in studies carried out in The Netherlands and Hong Kong (Brug et al., 2004; Tang & Wong, 2004; .

A cross-sectional study in the USA found that Hispanic respondents were more likely than Black or White respondents to say they would have a vaccine for swine flu and additionally Hispanic and White respondents were more likely than Black respondents to say that they would take an antiviral drug (Quinn et al., 2009 ). An Australian cross-sectional study found that those individuals who spoke a language other than English in the home were less likely to say they would wear a mask, be vaccinated or quarantined in the event of an outbreak of pandemic flu (Barr et al., 2008) . In contrast, a study carried out in Singapore (Quah & Hin-Peng, 2004) found no association between ethnicity and precautionary behaviour.

Some research in the UK during the swine flu pandemic has found that people who were not working, poorer or who had no educational qualifications were more likely to adopt avoidant behaviours (e.g., avoiding large crowds or public transport; Rubin et al., 2009) , whereas other studies carried out in Hong Kong have found that more educated people were more likely to avoid public places during the SARS outbreak (Lau et al., 2003; Leung et al., 2003) . In addition, two studies in Hong Kong with cross border and air travellers found no association between educational level and avoiding crowds Lau, Yang, Tsui, Pang, & Kim, 2004) . In Australia, a cross-sectional study of intention to comply with quarantine restrictions in the event of pandemic influenza found that more highly educated people were more likely to report intended compliance (Barr et al., 2008) . Also in Australia it has been found that individuals who are employed but not able to work from home are less likely to report intended compliance with quarantine restrictions (Eastwood et al., 2009) .",

The following types of assessment were classified as representing perceptions of susceptibility: concern about developing disease, worry about developing disease, estimates of risk, likelihood of developing disease, and chances of disease. Some studies in addition to assessing personal perceived susceptibility also include an assessment of the association between perceived susceptibility of an individual's family to developing the disease and behaviour (e.g., Lau, Kim, Tsui, & Griffiths, 2007b) . Associations between greater perceived risk and likelihood of hand washing (Brug et al., 2004; Jones & Salathe, 2009; Lau et al., 2003; Rubin et al., 2009; Tang & Wong, 2003) ; good personal hygiene disinfecting the home (Lau et al., 2003; Rubin et al., 2009; mask wearing Lau, Yang, Tsui, Pang, & Kim, 2004; Tang & Wong, 2003; ; building up body immunity with diet and exercise ; being vaccinated (Barr et al., 2008) and adopting other precautionary behaviours to protect against SARS including hand washing, respiratory hygiene, mask wearing, using utensils, and washing after touching contaminated surfaces (Barr et al., 2008; Leung et al., 2003 Leung et al., , 2004 have been found. In contrast, no relationship was found between perceived susceptibility to avian flu and hand washing in one study (Lau et al., 2007b) and between perceived likelihood of contracting SARS and carrying out precautionary behaviour (Leung et al., 2005; Quah & Hin-Peng, 2004) .",

In Australia, a cross-sectional study found that individuals with greater perceptions of the risk of pandemic influenza were more likely to report an intention to comply with quarantine restrictions (Barr et al., 2008) . In the UK, a relationship was found between a greater perceived susceptibility to swine flu and avoiding public places (Rubin et al., 2009) and in Canada, between a greater perceived risk of contracting or spreading SARS and higher compliance with quarantine restrictions (Cava, Fay, Beanlands, McCay, & Wignall, 2005) . A cross-sectional study carried out in Europe and Malaysia in the early weeks of the swine flu pandemic found that those individuals who perceived themselves to be at risk of developing swine flu were more likely to say that they had reduced their use of public transport, or cancelled or delayed their air travel plans (Goodwin, Haque, Neto, & Myers, 2009) . Similarly, an Internet survey carried out at the beginning of the swine flu outbreak found that those with higher perceptions of their risk of developing swine flu were more likely to have carried out avoidant behaviours ( Jones & Salathe, 2009) . A qualitative study carried out in the UK and The Netherlands with Chinese residents found that perceptions of susceptibility were associated with their use of avoidance behaviours during the outbreak of SARS in China (despite their not being in an at risk country; Jiang et al., 2009).",

The TPB postulates that the proximal determinant of a behaviour is an intention to perform it. In turn, intentions are determined by three constructs: attitude towards the behaviour, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control (PBC). Attitude towards the behaviour refers to the person's overall evaluation of the behaviour, which may be positive or negative. Subjective norms involve perceptions of how other people think the individual should behave in relation to the particular behaviour in question and also how these other people themselves behave.

Protection motivation (a behavioural intention to perform a maladaptive or adaptive behaviour) is postulated to be determined by two processes: threat and coping appraisals. Threat appraisal involves a consideration of the severity of the health threat and a perception of personal vulnerability to it. Coping appraisal involves a consideration of whether or not the health action is an effective means of alleviating the threat (i.e., response efficacy), and also a consideration by the individual of whether they will be able to carry out the health action (i.e., their perceived self-efficacy). PMT suggests that threat appraisal will generate an intention to act whereas coping appraisal will determine the type of action. This can be adaptive (i.e., in line with recommended behaviour) or maladaptive (i.e., against the recommendations). Rogers suggests that protection motivation is a linear function of the belief that the threat is severe, high personal vulnerability, a belief that one can perform the coping response and that the response is effective. It is a negative linear function of the reinforcements associated with the maladaptive response and of the response costs.",

There is also evidence from this review that perceiving the disease to be more severe is associated with taking preventive and avoidant behaviours. Both these findings can be explained by reference to the proposed relationship between attitudes and behaviour as described by the HBM and PMT which highlight the importance of perceptions of threat in determining behaviour. The review finds that having more confidence in the efficacy of the preventive and avoidant behaviours is associated with a greater likelihood of taking action.

In this review, four studies found that a higher level of general anxiety was related to a greater chance of carrying out preventive and avoidant protective behaviours. The common sense model of illness developed by Leventhal, Meyer, and Nerenz (1980) is a 'parallel processing model' whereby individuals simultaneously make cognitive and emotional representations of an illness. When faced with a new threat, individuals build a mental model of the threat in order to make sense of and manage the problem. The representation involves beliefs about the cause, consequences (in terms of the impact the disease would have), identity, time line, and controllability of the illness (Petrie & Weinman, 1997 . A parallel emotional reaction interacts with this mental model and drives coping strategies and health behaviours relating to that threat. A meta-analysis including 45 studies examined the relationship between illness representations and coping and illness outcomes. This demonstrated how the relationships between these concepts were consistent with those predicted by the model and that the model predicted a variety of health behaviours (Hagger & Orbell, 2003) .",

PRIME theory posits that behavioural responses are driven by the greatest 'wants and needs' at the time; the latter arises from anticipated relief from anxiety. This and/or identity as someone who follows particular rules, interacts with triggers to action (e.g., symptoms, advice from government) to cause behaviour.

Research has shown that trust is a key emotion which has been found to be relevant in risk-related behaviour (Slovic, 1999) . Levels of trust and satisfaction with communication are particularly important in a pandemic situation in that the authorities are responsible for providing information about the course of the outbreak and also for developing treatments and vaccinations. Lack of trust can therefore have very detrimental effects in terms of controlling the disease. Trust is important because it affects how likely it is that risk assessments from authorities are deemed to be credible and this belief in turn can influence behaviour. A lack of trust in authorities is likely to affect how people process and interpret health messages and risk communication advice, to increase concerns and to interfere with the way that the risk messages are interpreted and acted on (Petts, Horlick-Jones, & Murdock, 2001; Vaughan & Tinker, 2009 ). Issues of trust can be especially important in situations which are uncertain, such as how the course of a pandemic will develop. Slovic (1999) points out that trust is fragile and difficult to maintain, being easily broken because negative events which can destroy trust are more noticeable than positive events.",

Openness of government communication and acknowledging uncertainty is important for fostering trust (e.g., Wray et al., 2008) . Reviews by Lee (2008) , Menon (2006) , and Menon and Goh (2004) examined why Singapore fared so well during the SARS crisis, whereas Hong Kong did not and concluded that transparency in communications was key. The Singapore Government's success was partly due to their ability to build confidence and trust in the community and their transparent approach to communications. This was associated with compliance with the recommendations (e.g., quarantine) and reduced spread of SARS. In contrast, the Hong Kong Government lost public trust due to its handling of the event. In particular, the government said that there was nothing to worry about and failed to implement containment measures when cases were already occurring in Hong Kong. People were given inconsistent advice about precautionary measures and insufficient information about the spread of the disease. Some research suggests that the public are more likely to take appropriate action and accept the recommended treatment plan if they have been involved in the decision-making process (e.g., focus groups, patient forums; Holmes, 2008; Tam, Sciberras, Mullington, & King, 2005) . Such involvement can influence the level of trust that the public has in government and institutions (Holmes, 2008; Tam et al., 2005) .",

Further research analysing these possible mediators would enable communication strategies to target relevant attitudes. For example, a recent intervention study designed to increase hand washing found gender differences: men tended to be motivated more by messages highlighting the disgust of not washing ones hands, whereas women were more influenced by 'knowledge activation' -which involved being reminded of what they know already about the advantages of hand washing ( Judah et al., 2009) .",

If attitudes were assessed using reliable measures developed from psychological theory before an outbreak it would be possible to see if these attitudes predicted subsequent behaviour during a pandemic. In addition, it is important to carry out behavioural research during a pandemic where actual behaviour can be measured. This should include a variety of designs, including observational and experimental, and types of data, both quantitative and qualitative. Findings from such studies would add to the literature in that more confident conclusions could be drawn about influences on behaviour. The results from these types of studies could then be used to develop targeted interventions to encourage appropriate protective behavioural responses during a pandemic. For example, the finding that perceiving oneself to be more susceptible to the illness is associated with engaging in protective behaviours highlights the need to focus on perceptions of risk in communications. A certain level of perceived susceptibility is required to get people to take action. Communications designed to highlight perceptions of risk should also be combined with advice as to how the perceived threat can be lessened. For example, by emphasizing that risk can be reduced by carrying out the recommended protective actions and providing information about the efficacy of such measures in reducing risk. However, recent work has shown the conceptual and empirical limitations of social cognition models in informing behaviour change interventions (e.g., Sniehotta, 2009 ). Studies 'testing' social cognition models are usually observational, non-experimental studies, limiting the possibility of drawing causal inferences. For example, assumptions should not be made about the direction of causality (i.e., that attitudes cause behaviour and not the other way around) or about the stability of any observed relationship over time (see Sutton, 2002) .",

In sum, the review shows that there are demographic differences in behaviour: being older, female and more educated, or non-White, is associated with a higher chance of adopting the behaviours. There is evidence that greater levels of perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of the diseases and greater belief in the effectiveness of recommended behaviours to protect against the disease are also important predictors of behaviour. There is also evidence that greater levels of state anxiety and greater trust in authorities are associated with behaviour. The findings from this review can be broadly explained by theories of health behaviour. However, theoretically driven prospective studies are required to further clarify the relationship between demographic factors, attitudes, and behaviour. The findings suggest that intervention studies should focus on particular demographic groups and on raising levels of perceived threat of the pandemic disease and belief in the effectiveness of measures designed to protect against it. Communication strategies should maximize levels of trust amongst the public by being open and transparent in order to maintain the credibility of the information provided.
