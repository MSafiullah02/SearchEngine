However, existing review-based recommendation methods ignore the context-dependent (generated by user-interaction), real-time, and time-sensitive properties of TSC data. To bridge the above gaps, in this paper, we use video images and users' TSCs to design an Image-Text Fusion model with a novel Herding Effect Attention mechanism (called ITF-HEA), which can predict users' favorite videos with model-based collaborative filtering. Specifically, in the HEA mechanism, we weight the context information based on the semantic similarities and time intervals between each TSC and its context, thereby considering influences of the herding effect in the model. Experiments show that ITF-HEA is on average 3.78% higher than the state-of-the-art method upon F1-score in baselines.",

Therefore, efficient and accurate personalized video recommendation methods bring significant convenience to their life. Most of the video recommendation methods focus on users' behaviors such as their browsing history [1, 2] and reviews [3, 4] . In real scenarios, however, most people are unwilling to do high-quality reviews after watching videos, which causes the scarcity of valuable video reviews. Furthermore, some multi-feature based methods [5, 6] combine image information with review information to generate users' interests from a more comprehensive perspective. However, their methods have only achieved limited improvement because the images and reviews usually contain unequal information [7] . That is, the text information and image information generally describe the different amount of contents. An image in a video only describes one moment of the video content, while a review usually describes the overall contents of the video. The information gap causes the fusion of reviews and images to lose great information.",

[8] , see Fig. 1 ) has become increasingly popular in China and Japan, especially among young people. Nowadays, many popular Chinese video websites such as Youku (http://www.youku.com), Bilibili (http://bilibili.tv) and the Japanese video website NICONICO (http://www.nicovideo.jp) support the TSC. TSCs convey information involving the content of the current video frame, feelings of users or replies to other TSCs, which can accurately express the users' preferences for the video. Moreover, each TSC has a corresponding timestamp to record the posted time. Compared with traditional video reviews, TSCs are much easier to obtain their corresponding images by timestamps. The users' real-time feedbacks and the vast amount make TSCs valuable and accessible sources for personalized video recommendations.",

            "text": "In this paper, we focus on mining the users' preferences and videos' features from TSCs and corresponding images to recommend videos towards users through model-based Collaborative Filtering (CF). TSCs have several features distinguished from the traditional video reviews: (1)Context-dependent. TSCs are usually context-dependent, i.e., the latter comments often depend on the former ones. This phenomenon is known as the herding effect in social science [9, 10] . An example of the herding effect is shown in Fig.  1 . User A said \"I love the male commander!\" to express his love to the role male commander when he appears in the video. After a few seconds, user B and user C followed up by saying \"I like the male commander too...\" and \"I am so sad when he died.\" In this case, user B and user C may not make their comments if user A has not. That is, the emergence of a TSC is usually not independent, but a probability event influenced by other preorder comments. (2)Real-time. Each TSC has a timestamp synchronous to the playback time of the video. The coverage of a TSC is usually only a short time before its timestamp. Therefore, the content of each TSC is closely related to the video content corresponding to its timestamp, which makes it easy to sample corresponding image information by timestamp. (3)Timesensitive. According to our observation, TSCs with a large interval of timestamps are unlikely to discuss the same topic, even if their semantics are similar. Users are more likely to follow those newer TSCs than older ones. As a result, the herding effect mentioned before will not last long. These features make TSC a particular review. However, most of the current TSC-based recommendations [3, 11] assume that TSCs are independent of each other and ignore the time information. Such assumption ignores the above features of TSCs which causes the loss of crucial semantic information and affects the accuracy of results. Therefore, how to take TSCs' features of context-dependent (herding effect), real-time and time-sensitive into account to extract the textual information and fuse it with visual information accurately and effectively are the central challenges.",

In ITF-HEA, We generate users' preferences and summarize video contents through model-based CF. To analyze the influence of text information, image information and contextual information separately, we split ITF-HEA into two models: Text-based Model(TM) and Image-Text Fusion model (ITF), and one attention mechanism: Herding Effect Attention (HEA) mechanism. Specifically, in TM, we sample and embed the TSCs to obtain the sentence vectors (TSC features) by bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) at first, and then combine TSC features with the hidden (embedding) features of the users and videos respectively to predict the likeness of the user to the video. In ITF, we sample the corresponding video frame (image) features and incorporate them with TSC features to replace single TSC features in TM. Finally, we design the HEA mechanism which is based on contextual semantic similarity and time interval of TSCs to incorporate contextual information into TSC features to replace the features in TM and ITF.",

T-HEA even has better performance than the state-of-the-art method KFRCI, which shows that our HEA mechanism can effectively offset the effects of the herding effect and improve the performance of the model. The results also show that the context and timestamp of the TSCs are vital information and need to be considered. Finally, we discuss the influence of hyper-parameter \u03b2 and the number of contextual TSCs M on the experimental results. We fix M = 10, changing the value of \u03b2 from 0 to 0.5 (the step size is 0.1), and calculate the F1-score of Top 5,10 and 20 users' favorite videos in the validation set at first. The best results are obtained when \u03b2 = 0.2. We also calculate the F1-score for the different hyper-parameters in the test set, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 . The hyper-parameter \u03b2 gains the best performance when \u03b2 = 0.2 in any case, which is the same with the validation set. When \u03b2 is bigger, the result of the experiment is worse because it weakens the weight of other TSCs in the attention layer. When \u03b2 = 0, it has the worst performance, because the time information is not considered.",

In this way, we integrated the context-dependent, real-time and time-sensitive properties of TSCs in the neural network framework and predicted the users' preferences for online videos accurately and effectively. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset proved that our model could recommend videos to users more precisely than the state-of-the-art method with the HEA mechanism. This is the first step towards our goal in personalized video recommendation, and there is much space for further improvements. For example, to design a more accurate fusion model to capture comprehensive user preference is a challenging problem. Besides, how to measure the weight of each video to the user's preference is also a challenging problem.",
