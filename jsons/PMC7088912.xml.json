According to the EPOS diagnostic criteria, rhinosinusitis is defined as an inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses clinically characterized by the presence of two or more than the following symptoms; one of which should be either nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip), \u00b1 facial pain/pressure, \u00b1 reduction or loss of smell and either - endoscopic signs of (nasal polyps, and/or mucopurulent discharge primarily from middle meatus, and/or edema/mucosal obstruction primarily in middle meatus and/or - CT changes (mucosal changes within the ostiomeatal complex and/or sinuses). If symptoms last more than 12 weeks without complete resolution, rhinosinusitis becomes a chronic disease (chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)); otherwise, it should still be termed acute [1\u2022\u2022].",

Therefore, new therapies to control or ideally heal this chronic disease are desperately needed.

Deep insights into the cellular and molecular processes of rhinosinusitis are a prerequisite to identify such novel therapeutic targets.",

Therefore, attempts to define endotypes in addition to phenotypes of rhinosinusitis are undertaken. Biological endotypes represent subgroups that differ in their pathophysiological mechanisms and the corresponding biomarkers [2\u2022\u2022]. The identification of such endotypes is not easy since the pathophysiology of CRS includes endogenous and exogenous factors that come together in each individual in a different extent and form a highly complex network of interaction. Thus, the task is to clarify these mechanisms and categorize them while taking into account the individual variation of endogenous and exogenous factors. Despite these difficulties, the definition of endotypes could be instrumental for the implementation of personalized therapy. Cytokines not only play a key role in orchestrating the cellular interactions but are also key biomarkers for the diverse endotypes and thus very appealing drug targets.",

The innate immune system is activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), expressed by specific pathogen classes that can activate PAMP receptors on cells of the immune system and other cell types. One type of PAMP receptors are pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) called toll-like receptors (TLR). In response to infection with viruses or bacteria, certain TLRs are addressed. Ten different TLRs have been identified in humans, each one able to bind to specific ligands. Binding initiates intracellular signal cascades with a broad variety of effects on processes like hemostasis, inflammation, apoptosis, and also activation of the adaptive immune system. Activation of the adaptive immune system is induced by regulation of cytokines, chemokines, and other co-stimulatory mediators. Dependent on the pattern of the kind of activated CD4-positive T cells and the upregulated and downregulated mediator, immune answers are initiated. Here, Th1- and Th2-like immune answers are classical. Furthermore, during the last years, Th17-, Th21-, and Treg T cell phenotypes and the corresponding immune responses were defined (Fig. 1). In older studies, these are not considered. Compared to CRS, the role of cytokines in ARS is not explored in detail.\n",

PAMPs of other Gram-negative bacteria or S. pneumonia, microbes, often detected in ARS, are known to induce TLR-2 or TLR-4 related immune answers. The former generally initiate Th1-immune responses, and one may assume that this mechanism is also present in ARS. Nevertheless, van Rossum was not able to show upregulated IL-12 (typical for a Th1-response) nor upregulated IL-4 (typical for a Th2-response) in a murine model for nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae colonization [5]. In contrast to this, Riechelmann et al. detected increased values for IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN in nasal fluids from ARS patients compared to CRS patients using a multiplex cytokine assay [6]. An older study from our own laboratory showed elevated IL-8 and IL-3 in mucosal specimen of ARS patients using ELISA [7].

This underlines both the relevance of neutrophilic inflammation in acute rhinosinusitis and the relevance of IL-8 for neutrophil recruitment into the nasal tissue [9]. In a mouse model of rhinovirus infection, the importance of CCL7 (identical with monocyte chemotactic protein-3) and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) to induce and regulate inflammatory and antiviral responses was demonstrated using anti-CCL7 antibodies and an IRF-7-targeting small interfering RNA in vivo [10].",

Additionally, eosinophils are attracted by epithelial cells via the chemokines RANTES, MCP 1/2/3/4, and eotaxin [51\u201353]. Patients with eosinophilic, IL-5- and Th2-dominated inflammation with nasal polyps are clinically prone to \u201clate onset\u201d asthma development. They also show high TSLP levels in the local tissue as well as expression of CRTH2 and ST2 (IL33 receptor) [54\u2022, 55]. T cell activation marker soluble IL-2 receptor and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) are elevated in nasal polyps while TGF-\u00df1 and forkhead box protein 3 are downregulated. This leads to a reduction of Treg cells and their activity in CRSwNP that cannot be observed in CRSsNP [19, 56].",

Remodeling is also controlled by cytokines, the TGF-\u00df-family (TGF-\u00df1 and TGF-\u00df2), their receptors (matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPS) are relevant in this context. Collagen deposition and an upregulation of the members of the TGF-\u00df-family and their receptors are shown in CRSsNP, whereas in CRSwNP, these cytokines and receptors as well as collagen deposition are downregulated [22]. Thus, it seems that this type of remodeling is more relevant in CRSsNP.",

Specific IgE to S. aureus components has been demonstrated in nasal tissue and secretions and correlated to several aspects of disease severity, the degree and type of inflammation [58], and also to the development of asthma [59]. It was shown that S. aureus colonization is associated with eosinophilic inflammation, nasal polyps, and Th2-response though it is nor clear whether S. aureus colonization is facilitated by Th2 milieu or whether the bacterium generates it through exotoxins or other specific proteins [60\u2022\u2022, 61]. At least S. aureus superantigens seem to play an important role by generating a cytokine response from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that intensify the Th2-immune response [62] and eosinophilic inflammation. Treg-associated cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 are downregulated in the presence of S. aureus [63].",

Thus, new forms of therapy would be very desirable. One possible avenue could obviously be targeting cytokines.
