Rapidly changing ecosystems and human behaviour, an ever-increasing density of human and farmed animal populations, a high degree of mobility resulting in rapid spreading of pathogens in infected people and animals, poverty and war conflicts in the third world, and many other factors contribute to the more frequent occurrence and rapid dissemination of new as well as some old infectious disease.",

Ferritins, the iron storage proteins, play a pivotal role in this process. It was shown that vaccination with recombinant FER2 significantly reduces tick infestations in vaccinated rabbits infected with Ixodes ricinus and in cattle infected with Rhipicephalus microplus and Rhipicephalus annulatus. These results support the inclusion of FER2 as a promising candidate antigen for development of new anti-tick vaccines [28]. In spite of the fact that ferritin 2 is not the antigen derived from Borrelia, the vaccination with this antigen prevents long-term feeding of tick and transmission of Borrelia as well as other tick-transmitted pathogens into host. In this aspect ferritin 2 could be superior to OspA and is of interest to include it in development of combined multiantigen vaccine.",

This OspC variation arises primarily through genetic exchange and recombination and not by hypermutation with concomitant immune selection [32]. Owing to this sequence variation the protective range of single OspC-based vaccine is narrow. A potential approach to solve the high variability of the OspC is to prepare (a) polyvalent vaccine containing several OspC variants [33]; (b) generation of recombinant chimeric protein that consists of protective epitopes from those OspC types associated with disease [34]; and (c) combination of two or more different recombinant immunogens like OspC, DbpA, and fibronectin-binding protein (BBK32) [35].",

This problem could be divided into two fields: first, the stability of the liposomes themselves and second, the effect of the components presented in biological fluids (e.g. proteins and ions) on the stability of the metallochelating bond. In the example of OspC proteoliposomes, the gel permeation chromatography data indicated a good in vitro stability of the OspC proteoliposomes during the chromatographic process, within which they experience a shear stress and dilution. Also after incubating OspC proteoliposomes in serum at 37 \u00b0C, we demonstrated the stability of the metallochelating bond linking the protein to the liposomal surface [37]. In fact, in vivo fate of liposomes after the intradermal application is different from the situation after intravenous injection. First, dilution of proteoliposomes after intradermal application is not so rapid and second, the ratio of tissue fluid proteins to proteoliposomes is more favourable to proteoliposomes owing to their relatively high concentration at the site of application. In the case of another route of application \u2013 intradermal \u2013 the flow rate of tissue fluid within intradermal extracellular matrix is even lower in comparison with muscle tissue or blood vessels. This fact is often overlooked. The stability of metallochelating bond probably depends also on the character of the particular protein. It was shown that Ni-NTA3\u2013DTDA liposomes (containing three functional chelating lipid) with single-chain Fv fragments (anti CD11c) bound onto the liposomal surface were able to target dendritic cells in vitro as well as in vivo. The application of Ni-NTA3\u2013DTDA probably endows the metallochelating bond with a higher in vivo stability [63], but this improved stability did not influence higher immunogenicity [64]. Generally, metal ions, physicochemical character of the metallochelating lipids, and their surface density belong to the factors that could be optimised to get a required in vivo stability and therefore strong immune response.",

Based on this data, therefore, the half-life of rOspC proteoliposomes in serum was estimated to be at least 1 h.

Myeloid immune cells (monocytes, granulocytes, neutrophils, and also DCs) possess two types of intracellular receptor for MDP/MDP analogues, namely, NOD2 and cryopyrin (inflammasome-NALP-3 complex) [74\u201376]. These two receptors recognise MDP/MDP analogues minimal recognition motifs for bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans [77]. Another recently reported sensor of MDP is cryopyrin (also known as CIAS1 and NALP3), which is a member of the NOD\u2013LRR family [74]. Cryopyrin is a part of the inflammasome complex that is responsible for processing caspase-1 to its active form. Caspase-1 cleaves the precursors of interleukin IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, thereby activating these proinflammatory cytokines and promoting their secretion. IL-1\u03b2 is known to be a strong endogenous pyrogen induced by MDP. We showed that norAbu-MDP and that norAbu-GMDP analogues were not pyrogenic even at a high concentration, much higher than the concentrations used for vaccination [15, 65, 66].",

Nanoparticles like liposomes are able to provide a direct co-delivery of a danger signal (e.g., MDP) together with the recombinant antigen and therefore to induce an immune response instead of an immune tolerance. This is especially important for weak recombinant antigens or peptide antigens. Clearly, the recognition of MDP by DCs is crucial for the application of MDP analogues as adjuvants. Within the cell, MDP/MDP analogues trigger intracellular signalling cascades that culminate in the transcriptional activation of inflammatory mediators such as the nuclear transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Liposomes probably play the role of efficient carriers for MDP and its analogues on the pathway from extracellular milieu into the cytosol, where they trigger intracellular signalling cascades that culminate in transcriptional activation of inflammatory mediators such as the nuclear transcription factor NF-\u03baB pathway. Since the discovery and first synthesis of MDP, about one thousand various derivatives of MDP have been designed, synthesised, and tested to develop an appropriate drug for an immunotherapeutic application that would be free of the side effect exerted by MDP. The main side effects of MDP are pyrogenicity, rigor, headache, flue-like symptoms, hypertension, etc. Only several preparations reached the stage of clinical testing and only mifamurtide was approved for the treatment of osteosarcoma [77].\n\n",

Membrane protein can be reconstituted in their natural conformation in liposome membrane (yellow); lipophilised protein (e.g. palmitoylated protein) can be anchored in lipid membrane by lipidic residue (red). Functionalised liposomes can be prepared to facilitate covalent or non-covalent binding of protein onto the surface of liposomes. Selective metallochelating bond is applicable for His-tagged recombinant proteins (green) and this non-covalent bond can be transformed to a covalent one via carbodiimide conjugation. All above-mentioned examples represent highly oriented binding of protein onto liposomal surface. Covalent coupling of protein onto liposomal surface functionalised by, e.g. reactive maleiimide phospholipid headgroup, leads to random orientation of bound protein. Electrostatic interaction represents another way for association of proteins with liposomes. This association is non-specific and relatively labile in biological milieu (pink). Molecule of soluble protein can be also sterically entrapped in water compartment of liposome (blue). This is of importance especially for peptide antigens and protein antigens intended for direct delivery into the cytoplasm of immune cells to mimic virus-like pathways for antigen processing.
