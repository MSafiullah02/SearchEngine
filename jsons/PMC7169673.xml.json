She noted some persistent dyspnea with exertion, but no longer while at rest.

Overall, this indicates a \u22653\u2010log decline in viral load. The reduction in PIV viral load appeared to correlate with symptomatic improvement and reduction in oxygen requirements.

Initial oropharyngeal wash PIV viral load in our patient was similar to one of the HCT patients 10, but appreciably higher than that found in the other 2 patients 11, and we demonstrated a much greater decline in PIV viral load, as compared with the relatively small change seen in the previously described LT recipient 11. We used inhaled albuterol prior to DAS181 dosing, in an attempt to optimize local drug delivery, but cannot say if that made a significant difference in our patient's response.

Thus, it is difficult to know the true benefit of DAS181, as opposed to simply the natural resolution of PIV3 infection. However, the rapid and large (\u22653 log) virologic decline seen in our patient, which appeared to correlate with clinical improvement, suggests a potent, specific antiviral effect that resulted in clinical benefit. In addition, prolonged viral shedding with PIV infection is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients 15; our patient's clearance of virus fairly quickly after DAS181 treatment again suggests an in vivo antiviral effect. We were not able to start treatment with DAS181 until 3 days after her initial diagnosis. Whether earlier treatment would have led to more rapid improvement in symptoms and oxygenation is not clear, nor is the potential long\u2010term effects of earlier treatment on graft survival and the incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.",
