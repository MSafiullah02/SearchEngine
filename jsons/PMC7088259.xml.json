            "text": "Almost all multicellular organisms have AMPs to protect themselves from pathogenic microbes and acts as the first line of defence (Hancock and Chapple 1999). AMPs are an integral part of the body's natural immune system which exhibits not only antimicrobial, anticancer, antitumor activity and but also displays immunomodulating properties (Zasloff 2002). Majority of the mode of action studies performed using AMPs have cell membranes as their targets, and a variety of models have been proposed so far to explain the formation of membrane pores (Yeaman and Yount 2003). The disruptive membrane models such as \u201cbarrel-stave,\u201d (Melo et al. 2009) \u201ctoroidal pore\u201d (Hof et al. 2001) or \u201ccarpet models\u201d (Steiner et al. 1988) provide a deeper insight into the interaction of amphipathic alpha-helical peptides with lipid bilayers, which are often referred as molecular electroporation (Matsuzaki 1999). The variations in cell membrane lipid composition of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms form as the primary targets for AMPs. The specificity of AMPs to the target cells relies upon the peptides favourable interaction with the microbial targets, which allow them to lyse a specific cell without affecting the host cells (Hancock et al. 2006). Net charge, amphipathicity, and hydrophobicity of AMPs also play a crucial role in the association of these peptides to target cellular membranes from exerting antimicrobial activity. Diverse antimicrobial peptides have been reported from various ecological components such as plants, mammals, insects, and invertebrates. Currently, more than 2838 AMPs have been deposit in the antimicrobial peptide database.",

These peptide classes are collectively known as temporins and have shown the highest activity among AMPs studied till date, against both human erythrocytes and bacterial strains. The mode of action of AMPs against bacterial cells has been extensively identified and documented; their antiviral functions were not fully understood (Skalickova et al. 2015). Recent findings have suggested the efficacy of various classes of AMPs and their specific mode of action against viral pathogens and the potential use of these AMPs as an antiviral therapy (Marcocci et al. 2018; Ahmed et al. 2019).",

The amino acid sequence of (AMPs)belonging to the entire temporin family was retrieved from the APD3 antimicrobial database (https://aps.unmc.edu/AP/) (Wang et al. 2009, 2016; Wang and Wang 2004). A total of 121 antimicrobial peptides of temporin family from various organisms were collected from the database. The sequence alignment was performed with the aid of MUSCLE program.(Edgar 2004; Zimmermann et al. 2018). Followed by performing Multiple sequence alignment (MSA), the temporin family was clustered based on sequence similarity. MMseqs2 and CD-Hit were used (https://weizhongli-lab.org/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi) for clustering of peptides (Steinegger and S\u00f6ding 2017; Huang et al. 2010a, b; Li and Godzik 2006). Among the clustered peptides the conserved residues were determined using Weblogo (Crooks et al. 2004). The secondary structure prediction for the entire temporin family of peptides was performed to achieve the homology modeling. Further, the biofilm active temporin peptides were also predicted using the dPABBs module (Sharma et al. 2016). The half-life of the peptides was identified using the HLP, a server for predicting half-life of peptides (Sharma et al. 2014).",

In specific the hydrophobicity and charge of a peptide are critical factors determine the potency of an (AMPs) Any increase or decrease in the hydrophobicity index is directly proportional to the cationicity of a peptide. Most often the higher cationicity is attributing to greater binding efficiency, which results in effective binding of peptide over the bacterial surface (Malanovic and Lohner 2016). Once after binding the peptide takes its desired path to exert its action mechanism (Lee et al. 2002), while a decrease in hydrophobicity can reduce antimicrobial potency of the peptide (Kustanovich et al. 2002). During the synthesis of novel peptides, hydrophobicity is one of the perilous factors, for determining the range of target cells of AMP. Increasing the hydrophobicity of an AMP can alter the prospect of targets (Bahar and Ren 2013).",

The secondary structure prediction between the peptides shows the alpha helix and beta sheets, 98% of temporin AMPs exhibit alpha helical form. Some of the temporins display activity against the microbial biofilms, which are highlighted by grey colour shading (Fig. 3). From time to time, biofilms form a physical defense to protect bacteria from antibiotics.This might be due to slow development and reduced metabolic activity of a bacteria in such a population, the use of AMPs to inhibit biofilm formation could potentially be an efficient therapeutic option. In fact, due to the prevalent mechanism of action of AMPs, that depends on their ability to permeabilize or form pores within plasma membranes, they also have a strong capacity to act on increasing bacteria.(Batoni et al. 2011).A recent study on temporin anti-microbial peptides demonstrated significant anti-HSV-1 activity which was equivalent to that of Human cathelicidin LL-37 and a temporin synthetic analogue [K3]SHa. In addition, the study had emphasized its direct-acting mechanism for elimination of HSV-1(Roy et al. 2019). In an another in vitro anti-HSV-1 study using temporin B (TB), significant antiviral activity was observed which had resulted in a 5-log reduction of the viral titer. The disruption of the viral envelope was also confirmed upon observation using a transmission electron microscopy. Further, the TB was found to disturb the HSV-1 life cycle in different phases, including the attachment, entry into the host cell, and post-infection stage (Marcocci et al. 2018).",

The 3D structural of temporin antimicrobial peptides successfully predicted and results shows the alpha-helical structural diversity among the peptides. Phylogenetic analysis exposes that all temporin peptides are 70% evolutionary similar to each other. Some of the temporin peptides like tem_a and high scored half-life temporin peptides were docked to MERS-CoV protein, and results shows good interaction with the antiviral protein. These observations reinforce the idea that temporin AMPs may serve as a new therapeutic application for the future development. Furthermore, the findings reported above are preliminary and will certainly require experimental evaluation through in vitro and in vivo studies, which are crucial for their development into therapeutic targets against MERS-CoV.",
