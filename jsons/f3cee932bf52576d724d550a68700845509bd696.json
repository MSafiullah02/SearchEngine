MHV-A59 was isolated in 1961 from a colony of Balb/C mice that were being used to serially propagate leukemia that was caused by a virus (Manaker et al. 1961; David-Ferreira and Manaker 1965) . Probably multiple serial passages of cell-free filtrates of leukemic cells in newborn mice selected from an endogenous mouse coronavirus a variant that replicated to high titer quickly and that produced, as a consequence, hepato-encephalopathy. In our laboratory MHV-A59 has the characteristic of replicating to high titer (>10 9 pfu/ml) when cells such as 17cl-1 cells that express mCEACAM, e.g., the receptor for MHV, are used. On 17cl-1 cells, which were derived from spontaneously transformed Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts (Sturman and Takemoto 1972) , MHV-A59 causes cell fusion, forms very efficiently clear plaques of~5-mm diameter after 2 days, and produces about 10 4 virions per cell and 310 3 pfu/cell within 8 h (our unpublished observations). This makes MHV-A59 an ideal virus to study its replication at the molecular and genetic level. Essentially all of our studies used MHV-A59 and 17cl-1 cells.",

The genome is associated with a helical nucleocapsid composed of the N protein of 50-60 kDa. Surrounding the nucleocapsid is a membrane in which is embedded the envelope or spike (S) glycoprotein of 180 kDa, which may be cleaved in half by a host protease and which produces characteristic surface projections on the virions. Also embedded in the membrane are two other envelope proteins: a multi-spanning membrane (M) glycoprotein of 23 kDa essential for the assembly of virions and an E protein of 10 kDa, which although not absolutely essential for the formation of virions, is required for the release of large numbers of virions from infected cells (Kuo and Masters 2003) . In addition, some strains of MHV produce virions containing an HE glycoprotein and an I protein, neither of which is essential for viral infectivity or growth. The virions form internally, accumulate in vesicles in the cytoplasm, and are released rapidly en masse by exocytosis. Recent publications (Siddell 1995; Lai and Cavanagh 1997; Lai and Holmes 2001) review and cite extensive literature on coronaviruses.",

Viral structural proteins are not required for viral RNA synthesis because purified, deproteinized genomes obtained from virions are infectious. More recently it was shown that an infectious clone of the human coronavirus 229E with the genes encoded by the subgenomic mRNAs, including the structural genes for S, E, M, and N, deleted was able to replicate and produce a subgenomic mRNA encoding a nonviral fluorescent protein (Thiel et al. 2001a,b) . Therefore, the proteins produced by the subgenomic mRNAs probably do not function in viral RNA synthesis. Further evidence of this is that the ratio of the synthesis of genome to subgenomic mRNA does not change from the earliest times postinfection (p.i.) to very late times p.i., even after virion production has ended and viral RNA synthesis is declining (our unpublished observations). Therefore, the accumulation of structural proteins such as N (nucleocapsid proteins) does not affect or change the transcriptional pattern, that is, the ratio of the synthesis of genome to subgenomic mRNA.",

The question im- Fig. 1 . The coronavirus genome RNA and six subgenomic mRNAs share identical 3 0 sequences and form a 3 0 nested set of RNAs. The genome is translated into two large polyproteins that are encoded in the large ORF 1 sequence.

(2003) for detailed information mediately arises as to why Nidoviruses possess so many individual proteins, especially where other plus-strand viruses make do with 1-4 proteins for viral RNA synthesis and one-half to one quarter the number of amino acids. These extra proteins could be needed to produce a unique replication and transcription machinery, to increase the fidelity of RNAdependent RNA synthesis that is inherently error prone, to replace needed host factors that are required by other viruses, or to interact with and modulate the host cell or the immune system of the host animal. If mutations in all of the 15-16 genes of MHV give phenotypes that affect viral RNA synthesis, it would suggest that Nidoviruses utilize fundamentally different replication/transcription machinery than other plus-strand viruses. The viral gene products would also interact with those of the host cell because it is likely that the host cell provides functions not encoded by the viral genes.",

The first evidence for discontinuous synthesis was the discovery that all of the viral plus strands possessed the 1.7-kb sequence of RNA-7, in addition to the poly(A) tract at their 3 0 ends, and at their 5 0 ends, the genome and all subgenomic mRNAs possessed an identical \"leader\" sequence of 60 nt (Spaan et al. 1983) . It was realized that because this leader sequence is restricted to the 5 0 end of the genome, viral RNA synthesis must include a process by which the leader RNA is joined to the \"body\" of mRNAs 2-7 that are located at the 3 0 end of the genome. At the end of the leader and before the body of each open reading frame of the subgenomic mRNAs is an \"intergenic sequence,\" or \"IGS or IG sequence\" or \"TRS,\" or \"transcription regulating sequence\" (van der Most et al. 1994; van Marle et al. 1995) . Some also call it the \"TAS,\" or \"transcription activation sequence.\" For MHV-59 the IGS is 5 0 UCUAAAC 3 0 .

They suggested that the viral polymerase (RdRp) initiated plus strand synthesis at the 3 0 end of genome-length templates. In this model, after it produced the leader RNA and the IGS, the RdRp would jump from the 3 0 end of the minus strand all the way to one of the internal complementary copies of the IGS and reinitiate RNA synthesis. The IGS served to redirect the RdRp to an internal site and then served as a primer for elongation. This \"leaderprimed transcription model\" was based on three experimental findings. First, subgenomic mRNAs comprised a nested set of 3 0 coterminal RNA molecules and each contained a 5 0 leader sequence that was present only once at the 5 0 end of the genome Spaan et al. 1983; Lai et al. 1984) . Second, formation of subgenomic RNAs by splicing was ruled out by finding that the UV light sensitivity for the synthesis of each species of viral plus-strand RNA was directly proportional to the RNA length (Jacobs et al. 1981; Stern and Sefton 1982) . Third, cells infected with MHV were reported to contain only a full-length minus-strand copy of the genome; no subgenomic minus-strand RNA was detectable . They strengthened their argument by showing that only replication intermediates (RIs) with genome-length templates could be found in infected cells and that treatment of the RIs with ribonuclease (RNase) produced only RF RNA of genome length. The only model that could account for or explain these observations was their \"leaderprimed\" model.",

They did this by Northern blotting, using in vitro labeled probes to the minus and plus strands. After seeing their publication, we thought it was possible that the subgenome-length minus strands they observed were created during preparation of the infected cell lysates. They might have arisen from genome-length minus strands in RIs. Activation of endogenous RNase might have cleaved the native, genome-length RI molecules into subgenomic RFs by targeting certain nuclease-sensitive sites in the genome template. This occurs with alphavirus RIs, whose genome-length template can be cleaved specifically by RNase at a single, internal site that is near or at the site where the viral polymerase initiates 26S mRNA synthesis. The alphavirus RI population is cleaved into three RFs. The largest RF (20S in size) corresponds to a double-stranded form of the genome and represents intermediates active solely in genome synthesis. The other two RFs are derived from an RI active in subgenomic mRNA synthesis: The larger RF (18S in size) contains the double-stranded form of the sequence that is the 5 0 two-thirds of the genome; the smaller RF (15S in size) is the double-stranded form of the 3 0 third of the genome that is the 26S mRNA sequence (Simmons and Strauss 1972) . Therefore, we set out to determine the origin of the MHV subgenomic minus strands. We found (Sawicki and Sawicki 1990 ) that cells infected with MHV-A59 contained both genomic-and subgenomic-sized RIs, the latter of which would contain templates corresponding in length to the viral subgenomic mRNA. We also showed that the genome-length RI was not converted to a smaller or subgenome-length RF but only to the genome-length RF on treatment with RNase. This allowed us to conclude that coronaviruses produce subgenomic mRNAs using templates that are of similar size to each mRNA.",

In light of these observations, two models could explain coronavirus transcription: the replicon model proposed originally by Sethna et al (1989) and our model (Sawicki and Sawicki 1995) . With the replicon model, subgenomic mRNA would be made via leader-primed transcription using the fulllength minus strands as a template. Once made, these subgenomic mRNA would be replicated into minus strands that would in turn serve as templates for more subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Also, subgenomic mRNA that were virion associated (i.e., packaged into virions) could serve directly as templates for minus strand synthesis and result in the replication of the subgenomic mRNA. In our model (Sawicki and Sawicki 1995) , which we called by the awkward name of \"discontinuous extension of minus-strand RNA\", the minus-strand templates for subgenomic mRNAs would be made directly from the genome and would utilize a discontinuous transcription process. We proposed that, during minus strand synthesis, the viral polymerase would pause at the IG sequences and then relocate to the 5 0 end of the genome to finish transcription. This would result in the minus strand acquiring a sequence complementary to the 5 0 leader sequence and activating it as a template for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Those polymerases that failed to pause, or resumed elongation after pausing, would create the full-or genome-length minus strand template. The crucial observation that makes our model more attractive than the replicon model is that sequences downstream of the leader are required for replication signals. Neither transfected, subgenomic mRNA (Brian et al. 1994 ) nor subgenomic DI-RNA (Makino et al. 1991) replicated in cells infected with a helper virus. It appeared that sequences downstream of the leader RNA,~500 nt of the 5 0 end for MHV-A59 that are present only in genomes and DI RNAs, are required and sufficient for viral RNA replication (Masters et al. 1994) . Therefore, our model could account for and explain the known experimental observations.",

They changed the sequence in the IGS (in the plus orientation) or the TRS (in the minus orientation). They substituted one or both \"C\"s in the IGS UCAAC sequence at the end of the leader, in a body IGS (adjacent to a downstream gene), or in both. Changes in the leader IGS led to loss of all subgenomic mRNAs. In contrast, changes to the body IGS-7 led to loss of only mRNA-7. The very low amounts of mRNA-7 made under the latter conditions contained the mutated body IGS-7 sequence in their 5 0 leader and not the original leader IGS sequence. Significantly, when both gene-7 and the 5 0 leader contained the same mutated sequence, full subgenomic mRNA-7 synthesis was restored. Thus, (1) complementary base pairing between TRS at the 3 0 end of nascent minus strand \"body\" sequences and IGS on the end of the leader at the 5 0 end of genome template appears necessary to obtain maximal subgenomic mRNA synthesis (i.e., formation of the templates for subgenomic mRNA). (2) It is unlikely that the recombination requires recognition of a specific sequence of IGS or TRS. Finally, (3) the discontinuous direction of synthesis was from body to leader and, thus, the discontinuous transcription step must happen during minus strand synthesis, that is, during the formation of subgenomic minus strands.",

According to our model of 3 0 discontinuous extension (Sawicki and Sawicki 1995) , the viral polymerase would begin transcription at the 3 0 end of the genome. It would pause after transcribing each of the IGS UCUAAAC elements. Each polymerase can then either elongate through the pause site, that is, continue transcription, or move to the 5 0 end of the genome without copying the intervening sequences, that is, discontinuous transcription. The coronavirus polymerase might copy the template RNA in a fashion analogous to DNA-dependent RNA polymerases that retract at pause sites (Komissarova and Kashlev 1997a,b) and where the polymerase remains associated with the growing nascent strand rather than with the template. Of interest, a similar mechanism was recently proposed for proofreading by RNA polymerases, where the polymerase pauses, retracts, removes several nucleotides from the nascent 3 0 end, and then resynthesizes this region (Shaevitz et al. 2003) . Several gene products of ORF1b of coronaviruses and SARS CoV were identified that might function in such a proofreading mechanism, some of which are predicted to have nuclease activity .",

The interaction of the nascent minus strand with the 5 0 end of the genome might be mediated by protein:protein interactions between the polymerase attached to the growing minus strand and a protein associated with the 5 0 end of the genome. This also could occur by the polymerase binding directly to the sequences downstream of the leader. The minus-sense or anti-IGS would align the polymerase at the end of the leader sequence in the genome template. If the 3 0 -terminal nucleotide of the anti-IGS matched, the polymerase would elongate and copy the leader sequence to put an antileader (complementary to the 5 0 plus-strand leader sequence) on the 3 0 end of the nascent, subgenomic minus strand. Thus the anti-IGS acts as a primer to complete transcription and copy the leader RNA. The IGS in the context of the sequences surrounding it would function as an attenuator element. The result of 3 0 discontinuous extension during minus strand synthesis is that the subgenomic minus strands acquire the antileader sequence at their 3 0 end. The replication complex that synthe-sized a subgenomic minus strand may retain it as a template and go on to synthesize subgenomic mRNA. The promoter for plus strand synthesis would be within the antileader sequence. As stated above, because sequences downstream of the leader are required for minus strand synthesis (Masters et al. 1994) , only genomes can serve as templates for genomic and subgenomic minus strands; therefore, a great advantage of this strategy is that subgenomic mRNAs cannot be replicated and cannot behave as DI RNAs.",

They reported that extracts of A59-infected cells at 1 h p.i. made only minus strands and extracts of cells harvested at 6 h p.i. made only plus strands. Other plus-strand RNA viruses that replicate via RNA-dependent RNA polymerases show concurrent synthesis of minus and plus strands, unless minus strand synthesis ceases at some later time in infection [as is the case for alphaviruses (Sawicki and Sawicki 1998) ]. Thus minus strand synthesis in the absence of plus strand synthesis would be a very unusual transcription pattern.

            "text": "We first established optimal conditions for infection of 17cl-1 cells. If infection was done in low-pH medium (pH 6.8), infected cultures delayed the expression of the typical cytopathic effect and did not undergo extensive syncytium formation until after 10 h p.i., thus allowing us to examine a broader range of times after infection. Fusion of the monolayer at pH 7-7.5 normally resulted in the shutdown of viral replication much earlier and yielded only low titers of progeny. We found that MHV minus-strand RNA synthesis was detectable as early as 3 h p.i. in pulselabeling experiments using 3 H-uridine in the presence of dactinomycin and that the minus strands were exclusively in the partially doublestranded RI population, as expected for template molecules. The rate of MHV minus strand synthesis peaked at 5-6 h p.i. at 37C (or at about 10-12 h p.i. if infection was at 28C-30C) and then declined to about 20% of its maximum rate but interestingly did not cease. Adding cycloheximide before 3 h p.i. prevented viral RNA synthesis; addition of the drug after RNA synthesis was ongoing led in its inhibition. Unlike alphavirus but similar to picornavirus replication, both MHV plus-and minus-strand polymerase activities were unstable but in MHV they differed in their turnover rates: Minus strand synthesis was almost immediately inhibited after translation inhibition, that is, addition of cycloheximide or puromycin, whereas both genome and subgenomic mRNA syntheses continued for 30-60 min before declining slowly. The short half-life of the coronavirus minus-strand polymerase activity may reflect a possible role in minus strand synthesis of intermediate or partially processed polyproteins, whose further processing leads to loss of this enzymatic activity. Whether loss of minus-strand polymerase activity is correlated with its conversion to another type of polymerase activity (plus strand synthesis) is not known. The latter has been demonstrated for alphaviruses (Lemm et al. 1994; Shirako and Strauss 1994; Wang et al. 1994 ).",

If, at all times, it was found that minus strand populations were composed of genome-and subgenomic-sized molecules in fixed but nonequal ratios to each other, then the 3 0 discontinuous minus strand transcription model would be supported. Therefore, in an attempt to disprove our model, we used several approaches to ask which size minus-strand molecules first appeared and what the plus strand products were at that time. PCR technology allows the detection of very small numbers of target sequences. We designed specific primer sets to allow the amplification of genome (RNA 1) plus-or minus-strand sequences separately from the amplification of subgenome RNA 7 plusand minus-strand sequences. One of the primers in each set was targeted to the 5 0 leader (or 3 0 antileader) sequences at the ends of the RNAs and the other of each pair to the \"body\" sequence that would be a known distance downstream or upstream from the end. Our first studies used infected cell RNAs isolated at 7 h p.i., when viral transcription is readily detected by pulse-labeling in vivo (Sawicki and Sawicki 1995) . The results indicated that at 7 h p.i. cells contained minus strands corre-sponding to both minus-sense RNA1 and RNA7 and that both of these minus-strand molecules contained an antileader on the 3 0 ends. Uninfected cells did not amplify a PCR product with these primers, but cells infected with MHV in the cold (4C) and harvested at 4C after removing unadsorbed virus contained only genome RNA and not the minusstrand copy of the genome. Nor did they contain plus-or minus-strand copies of RNA 7. Our twice isopycnic gradient-purified virion preparations contained small amounts of mRNA 7, but these were in different \"particles\" than the virions because they were not adsorbed to cells during the 1-h period at 4C. The results demonstrated directly that the subgenomic mRNAs and subgenomic minus-strand RNAs arise from genome plus strands because that was the only RNA in virions that initiated the infection (Sawicki and Sawicki 1995) .",

Because the genome RNA is 15-20 times larger than RNA 7, each molecule of 60S RNA contains on average of 15-20 times more uridine residues and is thus \"hotter\" than a molecule of RNA 7 and easier to detect in pulse labels. Increased exposure of the gels to compensate for this imbalance verified the presence at each time period of the subgenomic RI population. Moreover, the relative proportion of each of the seven size classes of RI was maintained at all times studied, both early and late. We interpreted our results to indicate that both genome and subgenomic minus strands are produced at the earliest times in infection and thus must be derived from input genome plus strands. We have failed so far to detect a time early in infection when only genomic minus strands are made. Thus the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs observed at 1.5-2 h p.i., or other early times, must arise from copying of complementary and subgenomic minus-strand templates.",

            "text": "Up until 1989, the prevailing model for coronavirus transcription and the formation of the 3 0 nested set of mRNAs was \"leader-primed transcription\" ). The first report that coronaviruses might use subgenomic templates came from the lab of David Brian (Sethna et al. 1989) , who reported finding a 5 0 nested set of minus strands in TGEV-infected cells by Northern blotting. Thus the number and kind of minus-strand RNAs matched those found for the viruss plus-strand RNAs. This exciting report led us to probe whether MHV A59-infected cells contained more than one size class of RF RNA and, if so, whether these were derived from genome-length RI molecules. Our results showed seven double-stranded RF cores in infected cell extracts digested with limited amounts of RNase and demonstrated that they were proportional in size and amounts to template the 3 0 nested set of viral mRNAs and account for their nonequal ratios (Sawicki and Sawicki 1990) . Thus the abundance of individual MHV mRNAs is a direct result of the number of their minus-strand templates. We also showed that this family of RF molecules did not come from an originally genome-length RI by demonstrating the existence of a family of RI molecules in the absence of RNase treatment. Finally, nascent labeling experiments using very short pulses with 900 mCi 3 H-uridine/ml demonstrated that the subgenomic RI RNA accumulated label first and only later was radiolabel chased into single-stranded mRNA (Sawicki and Sawicki 1990 ). This precursor-product relationship is what is expected for transcription templates, leading us to conclude that discontinuous transcription must occur during minus strand synthesis and its result was the 5 0 nested set of minus-strand templates. If these contained an antileader sequence at their 3 0 end and a poly U at their 5 0 end, they could be directly transcribed into the subgenomic mRNAs. Thus the presence of subgenomic minus strands suggested a replication strategy that would be common to coronaviruses (and arteriviruses) and unique among the singlestranded RNA animal viruses. We suggested and favor the hypothesis that subgenomic minus strands are produced by discontinuous transcription directly from genome plus strands and are the only templates for subgenomic mRNAs.",

Such transcriptionally active structures are likely essentially single stranded in vivo, with only small regions near the polymerase in double-stranded form.

In infected cells, these molecules are predicted to have the \"native\" structures and to be essentially single stranded, with one or more RNA-dependent RNA polymerases elongating along the length of the template. When isolated from cells and deproteinized with phenol and chloroform (or proteases), the polymerase and other proteins are removed, allowing the nascent strands to collapse and bind to complementary sequences of the template. The RI/TI have multiple nascent strands and would be only partially double stranded and mostly single stranded; the RF/TF have only one or two nascent strands and would be almost or fully double stranded even without nuclease digestion. Finally, limited digestion of the deproteinized RNAs with RNase cleaves off all single-stranded RNA chains and converts these structures to fully double-stranded RF or TF molecules tive RF and TF under conditions when replicase or transcriptases are limited or initiation is reduced. Deproteinized native RF/TF would be completely or nearly completely double stranded as a result of having its one or few polymerases engaged in transcription and near the end of each template at the time of cell lysis. Thus plus and minus strands in native RF/TF would be mostly equal in length. Native RF are soluble in high-salt solutions (2 M LiCl or 1 M NaCl) and they function as transcription intermediates based on their rapid incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotide precursors. On the other hand, RI is a multistranded intermediate, whose multiple polymerases are associated with an equal number of nascent RNA chains of varying lengths. Its large percentage of single-strandedness makes the RI insoluble in high-salt solutions, allowing its physical separation from RF/TF, tRNA , and DNA. The MHV structures characterized so far are those active in plus strand synthesis . It is assumed that intermediates active in minus strand synthesis share some or all of these classic features, but these intermediates have not yet been isolated free of RI/TI active in plus strand synthesis.",

This sequence likely functions or aids in polymerase initiation for synthesis of the subgenomic mRNA. This strategy has several key advantages: It enables the coronavirus (nidovirus) transcriptase to skip over sequences in the template that are not needed in a particular subgenomic mRNA, thus conserving cellular substrates. Perhaps more importantly, it allowed the evolution of the \"nested set\" strategy, whereby each open reading frame is expressed at the 5 0 end of a specific mRNA. This in turn allows for regulation at the transcription level. The number of minusstrand templates controls the number of each mRNA species, which controls the amount of its specific protein product(s). It is not surprising to find that mRNA 7 is produced in highest abundance and it encodes the viral capsid protein. This strategy also would enable the genome to encode essential regulatory sequences once, conserving linear genome space, and at the same time to provide for these sequences to be added to each of the resulting RNA species that require them to function efficiently (ribosome binding; polymerase initiation). Fig. 4 . The subgenome-length TI and native TF are transcriptionally active and incorporate radioactive nucleotide precursors at the same rate (kinetics) as the genome-length RI and native RF. See also Sawicki et al (2001) . This evidence, which was also shown in our 1990 publication (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990) , dispelled any notion that the incorporation of 3 H-uridine into RIs with subgenome-length templates is into dead-end products 7 Turnover of MHV Replicative/Transcriptive Intermediates Coronavirus RI/TI and RF/TF are short-lived and turn over during infection and after exposure of infected cells to temperatures of 0C-4C. We were the first to show that inhibition of protein synthesis in cells infected with MHV-A59 caused minus strand synthesis to stop almost immediately (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986) . Plus strand synthesis was also inhibited when translation was prevented, but its loss occurred more slowly over time. This, as we pointed out, was different from alphaviruses that make a very stable transcription complex that functions for many hours in the absence of new protein synthesis. The unstable nature of the coronavirus transcription complex has now also been shown for the arteriviruses (Den Boon et al. 1995; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Recently we discovered ) that the minus-strand templates but not the plus strands made in MHV-infected cells are unstable and turn over. In most plus-strand viruses the minus strands are stable and are found not as free, single-stranded RNA but as components of RI or RF structures. Therefore, we were surprised to find that the RI/TI and RF/TF that had already accumulated in infected cells between 1-6 h p.i. disappeared over time after 6 h p.i. Minus strands made after 6 h p.i. accumulated temporarily and replaced some of the minus strands synthesized earlier. Treatment with cycloheximide for extended periods at early or late times p.i. led to the loss of 90% or more of the pre-existing native RF/TFs and RI/TIs and prevented the synthesis of new ones. The amounts remaining at each time subsequent to drug addition were proportional to the reduced rates of plus strand synthesis observed. Removal of the drug led to a burst of minus strand synthesis and full recovery of transcription. The turnover of RI/TI and RF/TF was specific to MHV and did not affect the RI/RFs of alphaviruses (Sindbis virus) in cells coinfected with both viruses, as shown in Fig. 5 .",

The MHV turnover process involved release of minus strands, possibly with dissociation of the entire replication/transcription complex, after which these minus strands were degraded. Minus strands not associated with plus strands were present in infected cells late in infection and after cycloheximide treatment. These \"free\" minus strands could be captured as RNase-resistant, double-stranded RNA if they were allowed to hybridize with the excess plus strands in the cell lysates before RNase treatment. The results suggest that the continuation of minus strand synthesis is essential for viral transcription seen late in infection and that the coronavirus minusstrand templates need to be continuously replaced. Failure to continue minus strand synthesis would cure the infection. Thus we would argue that the persistence of MHV infections would be dependent on host cell environments that either allow the virus to continue to form new polymerases for minus strand synthesis or block the turnover of previously made template complexes. Although this turnover resembles that seen for poliovirus RI being converted to an inactive RF, release of minus strands from RI/RF and TI/TF RNA is unique to coronaviruses (and probably arteriviruses) among animal RNA viruses. Somewhat surprisingly, it resembles what is known for phage Qb transcription, where the template and product strands are released as single strands after the polymerase has copied the template (Dobkin et al. 1979) .",

            "text": "Even more unexpected was our finding (Wang T. and Sawicki, unpublished results) that exposure to cold (0C-4C for as little as 20 min) led to the disappearance of RI/RF and TI/TF RNA. Viral double-stranded RNA that had been present in cells labeled with 3 H-uridine for several hours or even 30 min before exposure to cold was no longer detectable. We could recover RI/RF and TI/TF RNA by returning the cells to 37C. 5 . MHV replicative and transcriptive intermediates are unstable and turn over throughout infection, in contrast to alphavirus (Sindbis, strain HR) intermediates that are stable once formed. Cultures of 17cl-1 cells were infected (at an MOI of 100) with MHV A59 (lanes 1, 2, 3, and 4), with MHV + Sindbis (lanes 5, 6, 7, and 8), or with Sindbis alone (lanes 9 and 10). The infected cells were labeled with 3 H-uridine from 3 to 7 h p.i. (lanes 1 and 5) , from 3 to 9 h p.i. (lanes 2 and 6) , from 3 to 11 h p.i. (lanes 3, 7, and 9), or from 3 to 13 h p.i. (lanes 4, 8, and 10) . The deproteinized and RNase-treated RF/TF cores of the intermediates and native forms were obtained and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-TBE gel. The gel was prepared for fluorography However, if we added cycloheximide when we returned the cells to 37C, viral RNA synthesis failed to recover, suggesting that viral polymerase proteins were needed. Recovery of viral RNA synthesis was preceded by a burst of minus strand synthesis, and these new products were utilized as templates for plus strand synthesis. Rapid loss of RI/RF and TI/TF was also found after infected cells were treated with trypsin or were scraped from the surface of the culture dish at 0C, 25C, and 37C. The interpretation of these observations is difficult at this time, but they may indicate that the replicase-transcriptase is associated with the cytoskeleton and this association is disrupted under conditions that alter cell shape or cold-sensitive protein interactions.",

            "text": "Figure 6 presents our working model for coronavirus replication and transcription. The infecting genome is translated into pp1a and pp1ab. Within 1 h of infecting the cells we can detect genome and subgenomic mRNA being made. As far as we can determine, both genomic and subgenomic minus strands are made very early after the genome enters the cell. We believe that parts of the pp1ab function, at least initially, as uncleaved or partially cleaved polyprotein forms to make minus strands. Once the minus strands are made they would be rapidly converted to templates for use in plus strand synthesis. There does not appear to be any difference early or late in the ratio of genome and subgenomic mRNA; it remains fixed from the earliest moments at which the synthesis of viral RNA can be detected. As we published many years ago (Sawicki and Sawicki 1986) , minus strands are made throughout infection although their synthesis declines after 6-7 h p.i., but so does the amount of plus strand synthesis. Only the genomes are capable of serving as templates for minus strand synthesis because only they have a replication signal at their 5 0 and 3 0 ends. The subgenomic mRNA cannot serve as templates for minus strand synthesis because they lack the 5 0 replication signal. After the minus strands serve as templates for several rounds of plus strand synthesis, they are released from the replication/transcription complexes, which do not appear to be different for those making genomes compared with those making subgenomic mRNA. After their release they are subject to degradation by a RNase activity of unknown origin that seems to be specific for them because the genome and subgenomic mRNA are stable, perhaps because they are engaged with the ribo- Fig. 6 . Depiction of our model for the replication and transcription strategy of coronaviruses some or in the process of being encapsidated by N proteins that act to protect them. With MHV-A59 cell fusion starts about the time viral RNA synthesis reaches a maximum rate and cell fusion results in early killing of the cells. With mutants we have isolated that do not cause cell fusion, the cells survive until 24 h after infection even though the virus was released by 8-10 h p.i. We can delay the cell fusion and cell death with MHV-A59 if we use medium that has a pH below 6.5 and if we lower the temperature to 33C. If we keep the cells alive, the loss of RI/TI is easily observable. We speculate that coronaviruses encode in pp1a or pp1ab an RNase, for example, the XendoU in nsp15 perhaps (Snijder, Bredenbeek et al. 2003) , that is responsible for the degradation of the minus strands. Our hypothesis, or working model, is that the replication/transcription complex ages after its synthesis: First it has minus-strand activity, then it has plus-strand activity, and then it further ages and degrades the template it is using to make plus strands. Aging may be through a proteolytic cleavage pathway by the 3CL PRO in nsp5, and the final cleavages release or activate the RNase activity of the complex. This working model provides a framework for our future studies of coronavirus transcription and replication. Important for this effort will be the examination of ts RNA-negative mutants and designing mutants with reverse genetics.",

MHV replicative and transcriptive intermediates are unstable and turn over throughout infection, in contrast to alphavirus (Sindbis, strain HR) intermediates that are stable once formed. Cultures of 17cl-1 cells were infected (at an MOI of 100) with MHV A59 (lanes 1, 2, 3, and 4), with MHV + Sindbis (lanes 5, 6, 7, and 8), or with Sindbis alone (lanes 9 and 10). The infected cells were labeled with 3 H-uridine from 3 to 7 h p.i. (lanes 1 and 5), from 3 to 9 h p.i. (lanes 2 and 6), from 3 to 11 h p.i. (lanes 3, 7, and 9), or from 3 to 13 h p.i. (lanes 4, 8, and 10). The deproteinized and RNase-treated RF/TF cores of the intermediates and native forms were obtained and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-TBE gel. The gel was prepared for fluorography",
