The failure to solve disease problems through scientific fixes leads to managing human behaviors in ways that propose to optimize the effects of the technological interventions. At the core of the political response to infectious disease lies a pervasive belief that the spread of germs can be contained and the risk of infection can be mitigated by intervening in the cycles of microbial life. Disease scientists primarily have worked to develop and prescribe \u201csolutions\u201d to disease outbreaks, including technological medical interventions that seem to overcome human political barriers and predictive modeling of disease behaviors that can be used to plan social interventions. Vaccines, antibiotics, and other drug therapies overlie the sociocultural dimensions of contagion and cultivate the idea that individuals are culpable for disease prevention using techno-scientific fixes. The consequences of the belief that microbial nature can be managed exclusively for human health extend broadly into the human social life, creating a wicked socio-scientific problem.",

In part, this is because scientists made the modern microbe. Virus and bacteria are unseen in the environment, but science-derived technologies like the microscope render them visible.

They also showed that these forms of nature could be located within the human body itself, disrupting boundaries between human and nonhuman, and nature and culture. This dissolution of boundaries challenged a human political system predicated on humans as a distinct species outside of nature. Finally, this knowledge of microbes significantly changed how humans understood their own lives and the interactions that introduce death into human life. As a result, not only was the modern microbe brought into existence by science and technology, but the modern human was remade through this knowledge, particularly in terms of risk and the relationship between humans and the world around them.",

Managing disease was less a moral question and more a concern of how to avoid disease-bearing organisms.

Communities drained swamps as a measure of disease control and as part of broader river management plans. Civic sanitation systems offered another technological fix, separating humans from disease-bearing waste. Tomes (1990) argued that the late-nineteenth-century cult of domesticity created the moral imperative for homemakers to maintain high standards of cleanliness, primarily by consuming goods such as ceramic toilets, water filters, and chemical disinfectants. Such consumer products and public health works seemed to bring disease solutions within the grasp of any individual who could afford to consume or community who had capital to build.

The proposal that humans have an \u201cimmune system\u201d further defined the body as separate from and in opposition to its environment. Immunologists theorized that taking action upon the body itself could create immunity from disease. In the late eighteenth century, Edward Jenner, a scientist working with poxviruses (like smallpox and chickenpox), observed that people seemed to have varying levels of resistance to disease, possibly due to prior exposure to viruses. He injected healthy humans with fluids from cowpox lesions into dairymaids\u2019 hands, and then exposed them to the smallpox virus, a disease that ravaged human society in that era. His test subjects experienced increased immunity to smallpox. This new vaccine technology promised another way to combat disease, by creating human bodies that were inhospitable environments for disease-bearing microbes. Though the earliest vaccinations transferred living matter from one body to another, concoctions created in laboratories facilitated the wide-ranging dispersal of vaccines, spreading hope that disease could be eliminated through a simple prick in the arm. The promise that the application of science and technology could solve the human problem with disease seemed evermore attainable.",

The eradication of smallpox, however, also testifies to the role of human cultures in disease management, for though scientists had proven vaccination to be effective in increasing smallpox immunity, containing smallpox required the physical circulation of the technology along with manifold social acts to convince people to be vaccinated. Technology and scientific discovery cannot contain, command, and control, no matter how simple the solution seems. Scientists have developed vaccines for a number of deadly diseases that persist in the population, including measles, polio, whooping cough, and yellow fever.",

In the global campaign to eradicate smallpox, health workers realized that distributing vaccines around the globe not only required ratification from numerous nation-states but also social strategies that would convince people to allow foreigners with needles to act upon their healthy bodies.

The California Center for Infectious Diseases issued statements directly asking unvaccinated individuals to be vaccinated against measles, and county health officials authorized schools to send home students who could not verify vaccination. This governmental response placed responsibility for the health of the population upon each citizen, not only blaming unvaccinated individuals for the outbreak but vilifying their actions and insulting their intelligence. Here, broader questions about global health, economics, and demographics paled beneath debates about individual choices to use vaccinations. Even when officials acknowledge the social and political systems that shape contagion, at the moment disease erupts in a population, the public response tends to focus on individual behaviors like hand washing, public sneezing, and the use of vaccines. Solutions-based thinking connects vaccines to the promise of a disease-free society, without examining the assumptions and politics of the vaccine itself.",

These practices materialize a deep-seated belief that the human body separates people from each other and the world around them (Cohen 2009).

Sales have stayed relatively flat for years, with the notable exception of 2009 during the H1N1 \u201cswine\u201d flu epidemic.

An infectious disease like measles cannot thrive in a population where most bodies have been vaccinated against diseases, allowing a small percentage of citizens to remain healthy even when unvaccinated. However, as the aforementioned 2014 outbreak of measles in California demonstrated, lower rates of vaccination render all unvaccinated bodies vulnerable. When a critical number of citizens refuse vaccination because of a perceived risk to themselves individually, they create a security risk for the population, which must be addressed by government, and then public officials plead for individuals to be vaccinated for the collective good. When public health posters and politicians from the pulpit cry, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you!\u201d they employ a language that locates the problem and a perceived permanent solution with individuals. The educational message lacks the nuances and complexity that scientists see in human-microbe interactions, establishing instead, the expectation that disease can be contained by socially responsible behavior (and conversely implying that irresponsible behavior is part of a disease problem).",

There is a long history of using quarantine to contain the disease, but it is a history tainted by racial injustice and government acts that correlate health, cleanliness, and fitness with skin color and social class (Stern 1999). A court declared a 1900 plague quarantine in San Francisco to be racist in closing nonwhite businesses and in roping off Chinatown but allowing white residents to leave. While quarantine was never enacted, a 1985 poll by the Los Angeles Times found that the majority of the 2,308 survey respondents favored quarantine of AIDS patients. A decision to use quarantine during epidemics masks but cannot separate associations between disease and impurity under a call for health security. When governments impose on human rights in the name of health security they often shirk vital ethical discussions and broader social discourses that would expose injustices and systemic discrimination in these acts. Neutral, nonsocial responses to disease are not possible.",

By this articulation, the promise of a scientific solution seems to be achievable if the public cooperates. In 2014, as nations debated closing their borders to global travelers, the politics of disease control met the limits of scientific knowledge. Governments shifted blame from science to citizens. Displacing culpability away from scientists and onto human subjects may change the framing of infectious disease as a problem, but does not make it solvable. As a wicked problem, the Ebola crisis could not be solved, though social decisions made on multiple scales of government and in individual lives could manage its immediate social effects. Even eradication of a disease like Ebola does not break free of the problem-solution-problem cycle. Despite centuries of work in microbiology, people are still learning how complex their relations with microbes are, recognizing that managing disease brings unintended consequences to human and ecosystem health and vitality.",

With lowered disease stressors, however, populations continue to grow and move.
