With emphasis on the relationship between the Hopf bifurcation and the time-delay, we investigate the effect of time-delay by choosing it as the bifurcation parameter. By using tools from control and bifurcation theory, it is proved that there exists a critical value of time-delay for the stability of the model. When the time-delay passes through the critical value, the model loses its stability and a Hopf bifurcation occurs. To enhance the stability of the model, we propose an improved hybrid control strategy in which state feedback and parameter perturbation are used. Through linear stability analysis, we show that by adjusting the control parameter properly, the onset of Hopf bifurcation of the controlled model can be delayed or eliminated without changing the equilibrium point of the model. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical analysis.",

The spread of computer viruses and worms on the Internet is another urgent problem. There were more than 3 \u00d7 10 10 dollars in damage caused by the Email worm, and the entire Internet came to a halt in a very short period given without any countermeasures to control the worms [3] .

Because the actual process of virus spreading reflects a small-world characteristic, many small-world network models have been established to mimic the spreading of virus. A linear model of disease spreading in d-dimensional smallworld lattices, which reveals that the growth of infection is limited to the network scale, was proposed by Moukarzel [5] . The mathematical model is linear and the response is immediate as there is no time delay. Obviously, the model is not adequate to mimic the real propagation process. Yang [6] extended a more general nonlinear model for total influence volume. In Yang's model, a nonlinear interaction component was added into the infected volume with a constant time delay. A limitation of Yang's model is that the nonlinear interaction does not incorporate the topological difference in the small-world network evolution which is in fact of great influence on the spreading dynamics. In 2004, Li et al. [7] proposed a more general nonlinear spreading model based on d-dimensional small-world network model. Taking account of the influence of linkadding probabilities, they added another nonlinear interaction to the model. The local stability and Hopf bifurcations of delay-controlled spreading of the model was further investigated by Li and Wang [8] , where the link-adding probability and the nonlinear interaction were proved to be fixing points for the oscillating behaviors.",

In real infectious network topology, the link lengths between nodes are not always equal, so the time delay varies in the process of infection. It comes naturally to wonder if there is a relationship between the time delay and the Hopf bifurcation and whether different time delay affects the critical value of Hopf bifurcation. If the answer is positive, then fixing the link-adding probability by controlling the time delay is also a feasible method to stabilize bifurcating behaviors. In this paper, we are going to analyze the effect of time delay on bifurcating behaviors in the small-world network model.",

In this paper, the problem of bifurcation control is solved by an improved hybrid control strategy. As a fact that the natural equilibrium point of the system might not be calculated by analytic expression in practice, we use a real time state feedback hybrid control strategy to take place of the original one. Thus, bifurcation control not only can be realized in mathematical view but also is feasible in reality.",

As shown in Fig. 10 , the curve \u03b4 0 versus k divides the first The curve of \u03bc versus k quadrant into two regions: R 1 and R 2 . As concluded in Theorem 2, when \u03bc \u2208 S 1 , R 2 is the stable region and R 1 is the unstable region. Figure 11 shows the waveform plots and phase portraits of the small world network model (16) with hybrid control. To verify Theorem 2, we first set the parameter P = 0.1 for control parameter k = 0.6. From Figs. 9 and 10, \u03bc = 0.365 and \u03b4 0 = 3.171 are obtained. In the condition of \u03bc = 1 > \u03bc 0 i.e. \u03bc \u2208 S 1 , from Theorem 2, there are 3 cases: when \u03b4 < \u03b4 0 , the model (16) is conditionally stable; when \u03b4 = 4 > \u03b4 0 , the model is unstable and a Hopf bifurcation occurs, as shown in Fig. 11 (a); when \u03b4 = 2 < \u03b4 0 , the model is asymptotic stable, as shown in Fig. 11(b) . Besides, when \u03bc = 0.2 < \u03bc 0 i.e. \u03bc \u2208 S 2 , the model is absolute stable; no matter how the time-delay \u03b4 changes, the It is noted from above analysis that when \u03bc is set as a constant, the critical value \u03b4 0 increases as the control parameter k grows. Therefore, one can extend the stable region of the small-world network model by choosing a proper control parameter. To verify the performance of the hybrid strategy as a comparison with respect to Fig. 5 , we simulate the controlled model (16) by setting parameters of P = 0.1, \u03bc = 0.8, \u03b4 = 1 and k = 0.8. The results shown in Figs. 12 and 13 indicate that the bifurcation has been successfully delayed. It is noted that the bifurcation can even be eliminated by adjusting the control parameter properly.

Based on the tools from control and bifurcation the-ory, it can be concluded that the critical value of the small-world network model varies when we change the system parameters (such as, nonlinear factor, topology and communication delay). Moreover, a hybrid controller based on state feedback and parameter perturbation is proposed to delay the onset of Hopf bifurcation of the model. Theoretical analysis shows that the hybrid control can successfully expand the stable region of the model. Finally, the validity of theoretical conclusions is demonstrated by numerical examples.",
