Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious Science of the Total Environment 728 (2020) 138764",

            "text": "The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a public health emergency of international concern (WHO, 2020a (WHO, , 2020b . The reported symptoms of COVID-19 patients include cough, fever, difficulty in breathing and diarrhea, and SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been detected in feces of not only symptomatic but also asymptomatic patients Holshue et al., 2020; Jiehao et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020b) . These clinical observations imply that municipal wastewater of affected communities might contain the virus. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach to understand the prevalence of viruses in a given wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) catchment population, because wastewater contains viruses excreted from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in a catchment (Sinclair et al., 2008; Xagoraraki and O'Brien, 2020) . WBE is especially useful for early warning of disease outbreaks and informing the efficacy of public health interventions, as previously demonstrated for enteric viruses, such as norovirus, hepatitis A virus, and poliovirus (Hellm\u00e9r et al., 2014; Asghar et al., 2014) . In Australia, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 25/1/2020, and there have been N6,300 confirmed cases as of April 13, 2020 (Australian Government Department of Health, 2020). In the State of Queensland, there have been 998 cases of COVID-19 recorded on 14/ 4/2020. The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Brisbane on 21/2/ 2020 (two passengers from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship) and increased to 541 confirmed cases on the 14th April 2020 in Queensland's Brisbane North and Brisbane South Primary Health Networks (PHNs). To date, there has been no detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Australia, while we note a few recent studies conducted in other parts of the world (i.e., the Netherlands and USA) have reported molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples (Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a) . Here, we report the first evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Australia. Our preliminary findings demonstrate the applicability of WBE for COVID-19 surveillance as a potential tool for public health monitoring at the community level.",

The daily flow rate of wastewater was calculated as a point estimate using the product of the at-home population in the catchment of approximately 600,000 persons (capita), and the observed average per capita wastewater rate of 250 L/person/day (Tscharke et al., 2019) . The daily stool mass in log 10 g per person was modelled as a normal distribution with a mean of 2.11 and standard deviation of 0.25 per data from high-income countries reported in Rose et al. (2015) . Lastly, the shedding rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/g of feces was modelled as a log-uniform distribution from 2.56 to 7.67 as observed during the periods of heaviest shedding among mild cases of COVID-19 in Germany (W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020) . Summary statistics concerning the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections were generated by propagating a vector of each independent variable, drawn per the probability distribution describing it, through the model 10,000 times. For each estimate of infected persons, the corresponding prevalence was calculated by dividing the number of persons infected by the number of persons in the catchment. Sensitivity of the estimated number of cases to each model input was estimated by calculating the Spearman's correlation coefficient between each input and the estimated number of cases. For the purposes of the sensitivity analysis, the per capita daily wastewater flow was modelled as a triangle distribution with a minimum of 200 L, likeliest value of 250 L, and maximum of 300 L. Importantly, the model was conceptualized and executed blinded to any details regarding the geographic location of the catchment or clinical prevalence data.",

Among the five assays tested, E_Sarbeco and CDC N2 assays were the most sensitive (Nalla et al., 2020) . Vogels et al. (2020) showed that most RT-qPCR assays can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 by seeding SARS-CoV-2 RNA into RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs, but there are apparent differences in the ability to differentiate between true negatives and positives when concentrations are at or below ten copies/\u03bcL of RNA for China CDC N, China CDC ORF1, USA CDC N2, and USA CDC N3 assays. In this study, the level of SARS-CoV-2 in two RT-qPCR positive samples were near the lower limit of detection (i.e, amplified between 37 and 40 cycles). This may have contributed to the inconsistent results between N_Sarbeco and NIID_2019-nCOV_N assays. When the concentration of the target gene is low, subsampling error may also occur (Taylor et al., 2019) . Therefore, the performance of the currently used assays needs to be cross validated by seeding SARS-CoV-2 RNA into untreated wastewater samples followed by further inter-laboratory validation. However, we could confirm the specificity of the RT-qPCR by Sanger and MiSeq Illumina sequencing. Since wastewater is a complex matrix and some assays may produce false-positive results, we recommend sequencing RT-qPCR products for confirmation.",

The rationale for using the electronegative membrane is that greater adsorption of enveloped viruses such as mouse hepatitis virus and Pseudomonas phage \u03a66 to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to nonenveloped viruses (Ye et al., 2016) . Furthermore, koi herpesvirus (i.e., an enveloped virus) showed high adsorption efficiency to the electronegative membrane (Haramoto et al., 2009) .

A recent study successfully recovered SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater using a polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) concentration method (Wu et al., 2020a) . None of the reported studies to date have provided information on the percent recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater due to the risk associated with handling SARS-CoV-2 and the requirements for a BSL-3 facility. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has to date reported the percent recovery of SARS-CoV from wastewater which was estimated to be only 1% using an electropositive membrane (Wang et al., 2005) .

The clinical prevalence would be equivalent to 450 cases in the catchment, but the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the median would suggest up to 764 total cases -314 undiagnosed cases or roughly 7 undiagnosed infections for every 10 diagnosed infections. Unfortunately clinical prevalence data are only available for Queensland at the PHN level, and, therefore extrapolating these to the catchment population at this stage is not possible (Fig. 1 ) making direct comparisons difficult. Close collaboration with Health Departments will be essential in making these comparisons. Given the current variability and uncertainty in SARS-CoV-2 data, the median is a conservative measure of central tendency that demonstrates reasonable agreement with clinical observations. The model, as currently formulated, is parsimonious with opportunites for refinement as more data become available.",

The effect of this exclusion would be to increase our estimated prevalence by as much as 4-fold. The model also does not yet include any uncertainty or variation associated with the experimental workflow itself such as recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater. For example, if the observed mean recovery of virus concentration method was 10%, then the estimated number of infection would increase 10-fold.

There is no evidence to date that SARS-CoV-2 or the related SARS-CoV has been transmitted via wastewater (CDC, 2020; WHO, 2020a WHO, , 2020b . Furthermore, initial experiments indicated that fecal loads of SARS-CoV-2 are not infectious (Hennig and Drosten, 2020) . We therefore recommend that future wastewater sampling efforts adhere to established safety procedures. Also, ethical guidelines should be consulted and approvals may be needed when developing monitoring programs involving community surveillance through WBE. This is a proof of concept study and we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in untreated wastewater in Australia. One of the biggest challenges will be to establish quantitative predictions from the viral RNA concentrations measured in the sewage to the actual numbers of cases in the community. For application of WBE of SARS-CoV-2 infection, further systematic research is needed covering aspects from effective sampling and preservation through to data interpretation. Since application may be particularly useful in remote communities and confined populations, the availability of effective sampling techniques is of obvious importance. Furthermore, we need to identify or develop effective enveloped virus concentration methods and local data on the prevalence and concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. We need robust RT-qPCR assay(s) that can measure SARS-CoV-2 in complex matrices such as wastewater with high sensitivity. It has been reported that digital RT-PCR (dRT-PCR) is more sensitive and suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens with low viral loads (Dong et al., 2020) . Understanding the decay of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is also crucial in terms of their detection with RT-qPCR assays. Information on the composition of wastewater and environmental factors such as stormflow and its impact on wastewater may also be useful. These requirements are expected to be achievable and should provide accurate information on the disease burden in the community.",

Since different assays may produce conflicting results when the concentration is low in wastewater, these assays need to be evaluated head to head in intra-and inter-laboratory studies. \u2022 The virus concentration method is another essential factor that requires attention for improving the sensitivity of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater.",
