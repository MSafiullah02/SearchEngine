This annual meeting convenes noted public health specialists, vaccinologists, clinicians, virologists, and pharmacologists to enable interdisciplinary discussion regarding all aspects of respiratory virus research. Program topics included virus evolution, transmission, pathogenesis, epidemiology and surveillance strategies, and advances in antiviral and vaccine design for several respiratory viruses of concern, including influenza, rhinovirus, and adenovirus, among others. Here, we provide a topical overview covering areas of ongoing focus and research in the field of respiratory viral infections, with particular attention given to the advances and contributions presented by conference participants. The emergence of common themes and goals presented by subject matter experts during the symposium exemplifies the need for continued collaboration across disciplines and illustrates the potential for progress regarding the understanding, management, and prevention of respiratory viral infections.",

The transmission of respiratory viruses can be interrupted or reduced following the use of relatively low\u2010cost non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions, like patient isolation, hand hygiene, and use of face masks.\n7\n Several randomized controlled trials have explored the potential effectiveness and compliance of these methods in different populations. In a community\u2010based, randomized trial in Hong Kong, Benjamin Cowling and colleagues of the University of Hong Kong found a reduction of RT\u2010PCR\u2010confirmed influenza in household contacts following the combined use of hand hygiene and face masks when implemented within 36 hours of index case symptom onset.\n8\n, \n9\n Arnold Monto described initial findings from the first year of the M\u2010FLU study, in which the use of disposable face masks and hand sanitizer in a young adult collegiate population reduced overall influenza\u2010like illnesses (by 35\u201351%) in university residence halls during the influenza season.\n10\n In discussing the Bangkok HITS study, which is evaluating the effectiveness of these same non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions in Bangkok metropolitan area households which include a child with laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza, Piyarat Suntarattiwong underscored difficulties in achieving high compliance with these intervention methods among study participants, especially among children. A more statistically rigorous assessment of the relative contribution of these interventions in reducing virus transmission among household contacts will necessitate larger study populations, but encouraging results from available studies demonstrates the potential use of non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions in the event of an outbreak or pandemic, when adequate supplies of influenza vaccines and antivirals may not be readily available.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are responsible for both seasonal epidemics and infrequent global pandemics of varying severity. The extensive diversity of influenza viruses makes it difficult to predict which viruses or virus subtypes possess the greatest pandemic threat. It has been widely believed that, in order to cause a pandemic, a virus must bear a hemagglutinin (HA) subtype to which the human population is immunologically na\u00efve, be able to infect humans, and transmit efficiently between people. However, shortly after the XIth ISRVI was held, the emergence of the 2009 pandemic virus, a swine\u2010origin quadruple reassortant that was of the same subtype (H1N1) as viruses circulating in humans since 1977, once again highlighted the unpredictability of influenza, as well as the potential for rapid worldwide spread of novel influenza viruses. Continuing sporadic human cases of lethal avian H5N1 infections have emphasized the importance of understanding the receptor binding preference of avian influenza viruses to identify which avian viruses or virus subtypes might acquire mutations that allow for greater binding to \u03b12\u20136 linked sialic acids (SA), the linkage abundantly expressed in the human upper respiratory tract and the preferred receptor for human influenza viruses. James Paulson of the Scripps Research Institute discussed use of glycan microarrays (which possess a diverse range of glycan structures coupled to a single chip) as a tool to monitor the receptor specificity of circulating influenza viruses. In contrast to avian H5N1 viruses which have maintained a classical avian \u03b12\u20133 linked SA binding preference with few exceptions,\n11\n H9N2 viruses isolated from humans in 1999, 2003, and 2009 were found to possess enhanced binding to \u03b12\u20136 linked SA, as did an H7N2 virus isolated from a human in 2003.\n12\n, \n13\n These findings indicate that avian influenza viruses of other subtypes besides H5N1 have pandemic potential and should be monitored carefully.",

The influenza virus accessory protein PB1\u2010F2, first discovered in 2001, is a pro\u2010apoptotic protein encoded by an alternate reading frame in the PB1 gene.\n14\n A point mutation N66S in this protein is present in many highly virulent influenza viruses and correlates with increased virus pathogenicity in the mouse model, although the mechanism responsible for this heightened virulence is unclear.\n15\n Gina Conenello of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine demonstrated that an excessive cellular infiltrate in the lungs and concomitant increase in cytokines and chemokines contributes to the heightened pathogenicity of viruses bearing the N66S point mutation in mice.\n114\n In addition to virus\u2010induced pathology, secondary bacterial pneumonia can result in excess morbidity and mortality in humans. The PB1\u2010F2 protein augments the frequency and severity of secondary bacterial infection following viral infection in the mouse model.\n16\n Using a mouse model of secondary bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection, Jon McCullers of St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital demonstrated that treatment of mice with the protein synthesis inhibitor clindamycin resulted in increased survival.\n17\n Further understanding of viral\u2010bacterial co\u2010pathogenesis remains an important area of study given the contribution of secondary bacterial infections to severe illness and mortality in influenza.",

Furthermore, many of the challenges that face vaccine effectiveness of avian influenza vaccines for humans similarly apply to poultry vaccination, including the lack of a universal vaccine, poor immunogenicity of unadjuvanted vaccines, and antigenic drift of circulating strains.\n34\n Antigenic cartography, a method which allows for the quantification and visualization of antigenic evolution using a heterologous panel of viruses and/or vaccine strains from a particular subtype and ferret antisera, is a useful tool to visualize these potential antigenic differences between virus and candidate vaccine strains.\n35\n Derek Smith of the University of Cambridge further demonstrated the application of this method for assessing both veterinary and human vaccines and its utility in visualizing in new ways the titer and breadth of the immune response post\u2010vaccination.",

Representatives from several Southeast Asian countries described national surveillance and epidemiologic efforts. Zhou Lei from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention presented national ARI surveillance data which highlighted the distinct geographic patterns of influenza activity in China, demonstrating seasonal winter peaks in Northern China and year\u2010round influenza activity with sub\u2010tropical/tropical patterns in Southern China. In addition to surveillance for seasonal influenza viruses, the pneumonia of unknown origin surveillance program has contributed to the early detection of HPAI H5N1, SARS, and clusters of severe pneumonia cases in China. Sirenda Vong from Institut Pasteur du Cambodia discussed a multi\u2010tiered system for ARI surveillance, which includes community\u2010based active surveillance for febrile illness including dengue and a severe acute respiratory surveillance system to identify the viral and bacterial etiology of acute respiratory illnesses.

Khuntirat Benjawan of the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Science, Thailand presented results from a prospective cohort study of 1600 adults to study avian influenza transmission in Cambodia and Thailand. Individuals self\u2010reporting any prior poultry exposure were more frequently found to be seropositive to H5N1 virus by microneutralization assay compared with individuals without such exposure.

These resistant viruses displayed no reduction in viral fitness or person\u2010to\u2010person transmissibility, and in fact replaced oseltamivir\u2010susceptible H1N1 viruses in most parts of the world.\n57\n The rapid global dissemination of oseltamivir\u2010resistant seasonal influenza H1N1 viruses worldwide did not appear to be linked to drug selection pressure.\n58\n, \n59\n Similarly, the rise of M2 inhibitor\u2010resistance of H3N2 viruses in the United States and other countries has not been associated with increased use of this antiviral,\n60\n although its initial appearance in China could have been linked to amantadine use. As presented by Martha Nelson of the National Institutes of Health, the resistance of H3N2 viruses to the adamantines appeared to be the cumulative effect of several evolutionary steps, including repeated introductions of viruses with the Ser31Asn mutation in the M2 gene, intra\u2010subtypic genomic reassortment, and rapid global dissemination of resistant viruses. These presentations highlight the need both for continued surveillance of circulating viruses resistant to existing antiviral drugs, and the development of antivirals with novel mechanisms of action.",
