These proteases often exist within the polyproteins, and are excised by their own proteolytic activity ('autoprocessing'). It is important to investigate the autoprocessing mechanism of these proteases from the point of view of anti-SARS-CoV drug design. In this paper, we describe a new method for investigating the autoprocessing mechanism of the main protease (M pro ), which is also called the 3C-like protease (3CL pro ). Using our method, we measured the activities, under the same conditions, of the mature form and pro-forms with the N-terminal pro-sequence, the C-terminal pro-sequence or both pro-sequences, toward the pro-form with both N-and C-terminal pro-sequences. The data indicate that the pro-forms of the enzyme have proteolytic activity, and are stimulated by the same proteolytic activity. The stimulation occurs in two steps, with approximately eightfold stimulation by N-terminal cleavage, approximately fourfold stimulation by C-terminal cleavage, and 23-fold stimulation by the cleavage of both termini, compared to the pro-form with both the N-and C-terminal pro-sequences. Such cleavage mainly occurs in a trans manner; i.e. the pro-form dimer cleaves the monomeric form. The stimulation by N-terminal pro-sequence removal is due to the cis (intra-dimer and inter-protomer) effect of formation of the new N-terminus, whereas that by C-terminal cleavage is due to removal of its trans (inter-dimer) inhibitory effect.

Strictly speaking, kinetic parameters must be measured under conditions where the employed substrate concentration is comparable to the K M value. However, in this case, the substrate concentrations were quite low compared to the K M value. Therefore, the k cat /K M value obtained is not precise, but may be used as an apparent value.

In turn, they are proportional to the V max /K M values, because the K M is much higher than the concentration of the substrate used (Fig. 2C) . These V max /K M values may be converted to k cat /K M values using the concentrations of the enzyme species estimated by the SDS/PAGE analyses described above, and the activities are indicated by their k cat /K M values in Table 1 and Fig. 4 .

Moreover, they were able to process a substrate in which the core region was replaced with the GFP protein. Although SARS-CoV 3CL pro forms a homo-dimer [3] , this GFP-replaced substrate molecule does not dimerize with 3CL pro .

We used two substrates: pro-3CL(C145A), the model substrate of the pro-form, and the GFP substrate, in which the core region is replaced by the GFP protein ( Fig. 2A) . The difference between these two substrates is the ability to dimerize with the enzyme protomer (the mature and pro-forms of 3CL pro ). The GFP substrate acts only as a substrate, whereas pro-3CL(C145A) acts as both substrate and protomer in a dimer. As each protomer of the SARS 3CL pro dimer has an active site, the concentration of the active site in the reaction solution does not change when using the pro-3CL(C145A) substrate, even if the active protomer dimerized with the pro-3CL(C145A) substrate. Therefore, the difference in reactivity between the GFP substrate and the pro-3CL (C145A) substrate reflects the influence of the N-or C-terminal pro-sequence of 3CL pro (C145A) on the active site of the catalytically active protomer with which it dimerizes. The fact that the activity of the pro-form with the C-terminal pro-sequence (Q306N) toward the pro-3CL (C145A) substrate was lower than that toward the GFP substrate (Fig. 4) indicates that the pro-3CL (C145A) substrate dimerized with the pro-form (Q306N), and its N-terminal pro-sequence inhibited the activity.

This is consistent with the higher cleavability of the N-terminal processing site than the C-terminal processing site, as reported by Fan et al. [10] and found in the present study. They proposed a mechanism for autoprocessing of polyproteins in which the first mature 3CL pro molecule is formed: first, cleavage of the N-terminal processing site occurs, the dimeric structure forms as the mature 3CL pro , and C-terminal processing then occurs in an inter-molecular manner [7] . They also solved the crystal structure of an inactive mutant (C145A) of the mature form of 3CL pro , in which the C-terminal moiety of a protomer in the dimer was bound to the active site of a protomer in the adjacent asymmetric unit, and proposed that this structure represented that just after C-terminal processing had occurred [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 11, "end": 14, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 678, "end": 681, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1018, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The first cleavage"}, {"text": "Thus, the most important step in the maturation process of 3CL pro appears to be N-terminal autoprocessing of the 3CL pro moiety in the polyprotein [7, 12] . As protomer dimerization had been assumed to be essential for the proteolytic activity of 3CL pro , Hsu et al. [7] proposed that the 3CL pro moiety of the polyprotein dimerized in a different manner to dimerization of the mature form, in which the N-terminal processing site of a protomer was cleaved by the active site of the other protomer (cis cleavage). After cleavage of both N-termini of the protomers, rearrangement of the protomers occurs to form the same dimeric structure as that of the mature enzyme. Subsequently, cleavage of the C-terminal processing site of the other molecule of the N-terminally processed dimer, as well as cleavage of the N-and C-terminal processing sites in other polyprotein molecules, occurs. However, the possibility of a first cis cleavage of the N-terminus of the polyprotein dimer is based only on the fact that the N-terminus of a protomer is near the active site of the other protomer in the crystal structure of the mature enzyme [3] . This possibility was supported by Chen et al. [16] , who demonstrated that mutants of the 3CL pro pro-form that exist in the monomeric form, as determined by a gel-filtration assay, had N-terminal processing activities. In contrast, Li et al. [12] proposed a trans mechanism for the first N-terminal processing of the polyprotein, in which the 3CL pro moiety forms the dimeric structure of the mature form, and cleaves the N-terminus of another polyprotein molecule. They used two types of pro-3CL pro molecules with an N-terminal pro-sequence of six amino acids, accompanied by CFP and YFP at the N-and C-termini, respectively: one contains an active (wild-type) protease site and and inactive N-terminal processing site (Q-1E) (enzyme), and the other contains an inactive protease site (C145A) and an active (wild-type) N-terminal processing site (substrate). They demonstrated cleavage of the processing site in the substrate molecule (C145A). However, this approach did not eliminate the cis reaction by which the enzyme molecule and the substrate molecule dimerize. Although our results also did not completely eliminate the possibility of the cis reaction, they indicated that the trans reaction is sufficiently robust for the autoprocessing, and is the main path for the first N-terminal processing of the 3CL pro moiety in the polyprotein.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 151, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 152, "end": 155, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 269, "end": 272, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1134, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1187, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1384, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The first cleavage"}, {"text": "Liberation of 3CL pro from the polyprotein at the ER membrane SARS-CoV contains RNA(+) as its genome in the virion particle [8] .

These polyproteins are processed by PL2 pro and 3CL pro to form proteins nsp1-nsp11 from pp1a, and proteins nsp1-nsp10 and nsp12-nsp16 from pp1ab (nsp5 is 3CL pro ). These proteins form a multi-subunit protein complex called the 'viral replicase complex', which generates a nested set of viral sub-genomic segments by complicated reactions [8] . Only three cleavages (between nsp1 and nsp2, nsp2 and nsp3, and nsp3 and nsp4) are performed by PL2 pro , and the other 11 sites are cleaved by 3CL pro .
