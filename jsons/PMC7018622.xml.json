In humanized mice, Fc interactions lead to accelerated clearance of viruses and infected cells10. bNAb administration to macaques infected with chimeric simian and human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) is associated with CD8+ T cell-dependent lasting control in a fraction of the treated animals11. In humans, bNAb monotherapy was associated with increased T cell responses in 9 of 12 individuals; however this occurred after rebound viremia in all but 3 individuals12. Whether bNAb therapy has a positive impact on HIV-1-specific T cell immune responses in infected humans with prolonged suppression during ART interruption has not been determined.",

Gag-specific CD8+ T cells coexpressing IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, MIP1-\u03b2 and CD107A were significantly increased at weeks 6/7 and 12 after receiving bNAb therapy (Fig. 2a).

Specifically, the two individuals with controlled viremia beyond 30 weeks showed increased CD8+ and CD4+ responses to nearly all HIV-1 antigens tested at week 12 (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013c, participants 9254 and 9255).

However, the association between prolonged control and breadth in these two individuals is anecdotal.

IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot responses were detectable for six study participants (Fig. 4a\u2013d, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 4). Four individuals from these six (9244, 9246, 9252 and 9255) broadened the IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot response to Gag during ATI (Fig. 4a\u2013d and Extended Data Fig. 8f). Overall, 41% (9 of 22) of the detectable responses in these six individuals at week 12 were directed against Gag epitopes that did not induce a detectable response at baseline (new responses: red dots and section, Fig. 4e,f). In contrast, none of the Gag responses detected at baseline were lost by week 12. Finally, several individuals with detectable responses at week 12 had IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot responses against the major homology region (peptide 69-76, Gag285-304; Fig. 4g), a highly conserved motif in the gag gene of all retroviruses21.

            "text": "Previous clinical trials in individuals who are infected with HIV-1, who underwent ATI in the absence of immune intervention, showed increased HIV-1-specific T cell responses that coincided with plasma viral rebound, suggesting that this boost in antiviral immunity was induced by increased viral replication16,25. The increased T cell responses in individual 9245 are consistent with these observations (Extended Data Fig. 5). In contrast, our results demonstrate increased HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell immunity in bNAb + ATI individuals at a time when bNAbs maintained viral suppression. At least two mechanisms could account for the association of bNAb treatment with increased T cell responses. One possibility is that ART interruption in the presence of antibodies results in production of bNAb-HIV-1 immune complexes that activate antigen-presenting dendritic cells and enhance their antigen-presenting and cross-presenting capabilities to produce a vaccinal effect3,26. A second nonexclusive possibility is that the augmented CD8+ T cell response is driven by increased low-grade viral replication and antigen availability in tissues that we have not been able to assay during overt viremia suppression by bNAbs. While the underlying mechanism of the observed increased T cell immunity remains to be determined, a potentially important advantage of bNAb + ATI treatment compared to ATI alone, standard ART or T cell vaccination is that the immune system is stimulated with the individual\u2019s own virus while circulating viremia is suppressed. Whether the same effects will be seen in individuals who receive bNAbs during ART and whether the increased T cell responses are sufficient to help control infection remains to be determined.",
