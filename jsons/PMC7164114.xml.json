To test this hypothesis, we used site\u2010directed mutagenesis to replace the arginine with a glutamine residue (R273Q), i.e. its counterpart in ACE. This represents a positive to neutral change in the side chain at this position while maintaining most of the hydrophobic surface area. For comparative purposes, the arginine residue was also replaced with a lysine in order to maintain the charge on the side chain (R273K). Stable expression of wild\u2010type soluble ACE2 and the R273Q/K mutants was established in HEK293 cells. The medium, containing the ACE2 protein, was collected, and total protein (30 \u00b5g) was separated by SDS/PAGE. Expression of the ACE2 mutant enzymes was successful, and the proteins migrated on SDS/PAGE with the same apparent M\nr as the wild\u2010type enzyme (Fig. 2A, top panel). ACE2 protein could not be detected in the medium collected from mock\u2010transfected cells. Incubation of the ACE2 wild\u2010type and mutant protein (30 \u00b5g total protein) with 25 \u03bcm (7\u2010methoxycoumarin\u20104\u2010yl)acetyl (Mca)\u2010APK(Dnp) for 1 h revealed that the mutants, although expressed, were not active (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Following from this, no enzyme activity was observed when R273Q/K protein (100 \u00b5g total protein) was incubated with the ACE2 substrate for 6 h. The positive side chain of Arg273 is therefore critical for binding of the substrate. Maintaining the positive charge at this position (R273K) is not sufficient for docking of the peptide into the ACE2 active site. In fact, the distance of this positive charge from the surface of the binding pocket is also crucial.",

            "text": "Sequence alignment of ACE2 with ACE revealed that the ACE residue His1089, shown to be involved in the stabilization of the transition\u2010state intermediate [22], was conserved in ACE2 (His505). Indeed, the location (relative to the zinc\u2010binding motif) of His505 in the ACE2 sequence is very similar to the location of the catalytic histidines in both ACE and thermolysin, suggesting that His505 is the catalytic histidine of ACE2. On the basis of these features, we predicted and tested if His505 is the transition\u2010state stabilizing residue. In parallel, the role of His345, which can hydrogen\u2010bond with both the C\u2010terminus and the secondary amine group of the ACE2 inhibitor MLN\u20104760 (Fig. 1A), was explored. To investigate the role of His505 and His345 in catalysis, the histidine residues were replaced with both alanine and leucine (H505A/L and H345A/L). Stable expression of the ACE2 mutants was established in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, top panels). Upon incubation of the mutant protein (30 \u00b5g total protein) with the ACE2 fluorogenic substrate for 1 h, little or no enzyme activity was observed (Fig. 2, bottom panels). Subsequently, enzyme activity was examined under extensive hydrolytic conditions [100 \u00b5g total protein was incubated with 25 mm Mca\u2010APK(Dnp) for 6 h], and as a result the mutant enzymes were found to be considerably less active than the wild\u2010type enzyme (Table 1). With such little activity remaining (H505A \u2248 60\u2010fold, H505L \u2248 250\u2010fold, and H345A/L \u2248 300\u2010fold less active than the wild\u2010type enzyme), subsequent kinetic analysis of the ACE2 mutants was not feasible. These data establish an important role for both His505 and His345 as their replacement results in enzyme activity being dramatically reduced.",

            "text": "Modelling and structure determination, by Guy et al. [17] and Towler et al. [20], respectively, show that His505 and His345 (corresponding to His513 and His353 in tACE) play a key role in binding the substrate in ACE2. This structural information was used to probe further the role of these residues in catalysis. From the superposition of the active sites of ACE2 and tACE, several observations can be made. In both structures the histidine NE2 nitrogens (the protonated histidine side chain N\u03b5 nitrogen) of both residues are within hydrogen\u2010bonding distance of the carbonyl oxygen of the amide group of residue P1\u2032 (tACE) (Fig. 1B) or equivalent terminal carboxylate oxygen (ACE2) (Fig. 1A) of the inhibitors. The first histidine (His353 in tACE and His345 in ACE2) is also within hydrogen\u2010bonding distance (3.2 \u00c5 in both ACE and ACE2) of the sp3 hybridized nitrogen of the inhibitors (which is the nitrogen involved in substrate peptide bond cleavage). It is therefore more likely to be this histidine that acts as a hydrogen bond donor/acceptor in the formation of the tetrahedral peptide intermediate in catalysis (Fig. 3) and not His505, which contradicts the role of His505 described by Towler et al. [20]. The closest potential nitrogen of His505(NE2) to the sp3 hybridized nitrogen is too far away (over 5 \u00c5) for hydrogen\u2010bond formation. Instead, His505 may be important in hydrogen\u2010bonding to Tyr515(OH), which has been suggested to stabilize the carbonyl tetrahedral intermediate in ACE2 [20], and the equivalent Tyr in the Drosophila homologue, AnCE, [23] and Pyrococcus furiosus carboxypeptidase [24], all of which are zinc metalloproteases with similar overall tertiary structure. In the C\u2010domain of ACE, the equivalent residue to His505 in ACE2 has been suggested to be involved in stabilizing the carbonyl tetrahedral intermediate directly [22], with a hydrogen bond being formed between His1089(NE2) and the oxyanion formed during transition\u2010state binding. Certainly, a carbonyl tetrahedral intermediate modelled at the carbon C4 of MLN\u2010470 (the equivalent carbon of the carbonyl tetrahedral intermediate of the substrate) would support an identical role for His505 in ACE2 catalysis (Fig. 3). However, Towler et al. [20] suggest that His505 is too far from the zinc\u2010bound carboxylate to be directly involved in the stabilization of the carbonyl tetrahedral intermediate. Overall, the greater loss in activity for the H345A mutation (\u2248 330\u2010fold decrease in activity) than the H505A mutation (\u2248 60\u2010fold decrease) would support a more important role for His345 in catalysis rather than His505.",

            "text": "The chloride dependence of ACE has long been recognized [25], and most recently mutagenesis studies have shown that it is in fact an arginine residue (Arg1098) that is essential for the chloride activation of ACE [18]. The structure of tACE revealed the location of two buried chloride ions [19]. The second chloride ion (CL2) was found to be bound to a water molecule and two amino\u2010acid residues, one being the equivalent residue to Arg1098 (Arg522). The presence of another chloride ion (CL1), located away from the active site, was unexpected. Again an arginine residue (Arg186) was found to play a key role in the positioning of the chloride ion at this site. Sequence alignment of ACE2 with ACE revealed that both the arginine residues at each chloride site, CL1 and CL2, were conserved in ACE2 (Arg169 and Arg514, respectively). The ACE2 mutants R169Q and R514Q were therefore created and were expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B, top panel). The effect of chloride ions on enzyme activity was investigated (Fig. 4). The hydrolysis of Mca\u2010APK(Dnp) by ACE2 is greatly enhanced in the presence of chloride ions [4, 17]. At high concentrations of NaCl (0.5 m), the activity of the wild\u2010type enzyme was increased \u2248 3.5\u2010fold (Fig. 5). The ACE2 mutant R514Q, however, did not show the expected loss of chloride activation. Instead, in the presence of high salt, enzyme activity was \u2248 11\u2010fold greater, and as such this mutant was much more sensitive to chloride ions than the wild\u2010type enzyme. Intriguingly, the ACE2 structure [20] revealed the absence of a bound chloride in the CL2 site. These data combined suggest that, unlike ACE, this second site in ACE2 does not exist and therefore does not contribute to the chloride effect. In the light of this finding, an assumption might be that it is actually the CL1 site that is responsible for chloride activation of ACE2. In contrast with the second site, a bound chloride in the ACE2 structure was reported in an identical position to the first binding site (CL1) of tACE. Yet, in the presence of NaCl, the R169Q mutant in which the CL1 chloride\u2010binding site has potentially been abolished, responds with an approximately fivefold increase in activation (Fig. 5), which is slightly greater than wild\u2010type. In fact, the activity profile for R169Q mirrors that obtained for the wild\u2010type enzyme (Fig. 4).",

            "text": "Superimposing the structure of ACE2 on to tACE in inhibitor\u2010bound states revealed significant changes between the chloride ion\u2010binding sites of each enzyme. The designated CL2 site in tACE is absent from ACE2 [20], and this is due to the substitution of Pro407 and Pro519 in ACE for Glu398 and Ser511 in ACE2. The side chains of Glu398 and Ser511 project into the location of the chloride ion\u2010binding site and Ser511 hydrogen bonds with Arg514 [the equivalent Arg522 (NH1) coordinates the chloride ion in tACE]. Arg514 in ACE2 is displaced relative to Arg522 in ACE and is somewhat closer to the zinc\u2010binding site. The CL2 binding site is in close proximity to the catalytic site (10.4 \u00c5 away from the zinc) and is located at the interface between subdomains I and II (Table 2). Residue Pro407 in ACE (equivalent to Glu398 in ACE2) is in the hinge region between the two subdomains [20]. Hence, the binding of chloride to this site might be expected to affect zinc and ligand binding as well as the interactions between subdomain I and II. This effect would only be present in ACE as the site is absent from ACE2. Interestingly, the R514Q mutant at the CL2 site of ACE2 has limited effect on the activity of ACE2 in either the presence or absence of chloride ions. This is possibly a result of the fact Arg514 is not involved in chloride binding in ACE2 and its influence on activity is restricted to its effect on substrate binding, which would appear to be fairly small. However, site\u2010directed mutagenesis studies of the equivalent residue R1098Q in somatic ACE (sACE; equivalent to Arg522 in tACE) have a dramatic effect [18], with the mutation causing increased activity with the angiotensin I substrate relative to wild\u2010type in the absence of chloride. Presumably, this is the result of chloride binding at the CL2 site in ACE stabilizing complex formation. Therefore, removing this site (by mutation) stabilizes the complex formation and decreases the chloride dependency to that exerted by the occupancy of the CL1 site alone.",

Residues coordinating the chloride ligand in tACE, Trp485, Arg186 and Arg489, are largely conserved in ACE2, as Trp477, Arg169 and Lys481. However, the Arg to Lys change may have some effect on chloride affinity. The Lys(NZ)\u2013CL1 (5.2 \u00c5) interaction in ACE2 is less intimate than that of Arg489(NH1)\u2013CL1 (3.2 \u00c5) in ACE (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the large difference in solvation energy between Arg and Lys might be expected to weaken chloride affinity in ACE2 relative to ACE. Presumably, the role of the CL1\u2010binding site is to stabilize the native state of subdomain II when in complex with the ligand. Although this is unlikely to have a direct influence on zinc binding (the zinc ion is separated from CL1 by 20.7 \u00c5 in tACE and is coordinated by residues in subdomain I), it may be important for stabilizing complex formation for those residues in subdomain II involved directly in substrate binding (Arg273 in ACE2 and Gln281, Lys511, Tyr520 in tACE, which bind the C\u2010terminal carboxy group of the respective inhibitors) and catalysis (His505 in ACE2 and the equivalent His511 in tACE). A similar hypothesis has been proposed for the role of the CL1 site in both domains of ACE [26]. It is surprising that the mutation R169Q has very little effect on activity in either the presence or absence of chloride. This may be the result of the fact that the mutant enzyme is still able to bind chloride at this site and retain its activating effect. Other residues within the site may be more important for chloride binding and their substitution may give rise to a more dramatic effect on chloride activation. For example, Asp499 found in the coordination shell of the chloride ion is in close proximity to some of the catalytic machinery and therefore may affect stabilization of the active enzyme complex. Trp478 hydrogen\u2010bonds with Asp499, and so, indirectly, its replacement may also elicit an effect on chloride activation. Less obviously, Trp271 lies two residues upstream of Arg273 (critical for substrate binding) and so it might \u2018transmit\u2019 effects on binding/catalysis of the substrate.

            "text": "The difference in chloride sensitivity between ACE2 and ACE makes sense in view of the fact that ACE2 has only one chloride\u2010binding site (CL1) whereas ACE has two sites (one in each subdomain). In addition to this, the CL1 site is found in subdomain II, some distance from the active site, and, with a likely difference in affinity for chloride at this site being suggested for ACE2 (see above), further explains this phenomenon. Liu et al. [18] showed a dramatic loss of chloride activation in the C\u2010domain of ACE where the CL2 site has been abolished. However, this effect is not all or nothing in that some enzyme activation is still observed. In this case, it is likely that ACE behaves more like ACE2, with only a single occupied site (CL1) contributing to the activation of substrate hydrolysis by chloride. Interestingly, Natesh et al. [27] suggest that, compared with ACE, the CL1 binding site in AnCE may also be altered and the CL2 site may be absent.",

The complete loss of activity observed as a result of replacing this single residue could not have been predicted simply by analysis of the active\u2010site structure. Further to this, the role of His505 and His345 in catalysis has been probed which has provided new insight into transition\u2010state stabilization by ACE2 and other zinc proteases, e.g. ACE. Our mutagenesis data therefore provide additional critical information over that obtained from X\u2010ray data alone. The knowledge gained from these mutagenesis data will be valuable in directing the design of modulators of ACE2 activity. At present, very few studies have been carried out to develop inhibitors of ACE2 [24, 28, 29] despite the emerging importance of this enzyme in both cardiovascular homoeostasis and viral entry mechanisms. Finally, a comprehensive explanation for the differing sensitivity of ACE2 and ACE to chloride ions has been suggested, but how this relates to the physiological significance of chloride activation remains to be explored.",
