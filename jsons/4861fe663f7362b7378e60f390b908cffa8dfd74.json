Activation of GA carboxy groups was carried out with the help of N -hydroxysuccinimide, N,N' -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or N -hydroxybenzotriazole with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. A proline-containing GA derivative is a low-toxic substance; it raises the level of agglutinins by 3.7 times in the blood of mice and 3 times that of hemolysins compared with the control. Dipeptide GA derivatives possess an expressed anti-HIV-1 activity in cultures of MT-4 cells and are 90-70 times less cytotoxic than azidothymidine. The selectivity index of the compounds exceeds those of GA by 110 and 34 times, respectively.",

New viral respiratory infections are appearing such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Avian Influenza, etc. 2 Therefore, antiviral preparations are among the most intensively developed medicinal products in recent years. A prospective approach in the solution of the problem is the search for new antiviral agents among the natural compounds obtained from the available raw material of plant origin, their derivatives, and modified analogues. GA ( I ), a main triterpene saponin in the extract of roots of licorice ( Glycyrrhyza glabra L.) and Ural Glycyrrhyza uralensis Fisher are among the natural compounds that are of interest as base structures for the creation of new highly effective antiviral preparations and means for treatment and preventive maintenance of immunodeficiencies of various etiologies. These plants are widespread in the territory of Western Siberia, Southern Urals, Central Asia, Afghanistan, East China, Mongolia, Spain, and other regions [1] . GA and its monoammonium salt, Glycirram, completely inhibit in vitro the reproduction of some DNA and RNA viruses ( Vaccinia, New Castle, Vesicular stomatitus, Herpes simplex, Herpes B , and Varicella zoster ) [2] . GA is a leading natural glycoside suitable for prolonged therapy of the HIV infection and viral hepatitites B and C [3] [4] [5] . A unique property of GA is its ability to exhibit an anti-HIV effect already at early stages of the virus's replication cycle and inhibit the stage of the virus's adsorption by a cell [6] .",

The application of them considerably simplifies the stage of deblocking of the \u00eb -terminal amino acids: it comes down to the treatment of the resulting conjugate with TFA at 20-22\u00b0\u00eb for 0.5-1 h [8] . The GA carboxy group was activated with the help of a HONSu-DCC mixture in dioxane according to the procedure in [13] . Carrying out this reaction at 0-5\u00b0\u00eb with the use of 2.5 DCC equiv allows the selective modification of only carboxy groups of GA carbohydrate moiety ( II ). The interaction of active GA ester ( II ) with tert -butyl esters of L -amino acids (dipeptides) was carried out at 20-22\u00b0\u00eb in the presence of a small excess of triethylamine (1-2 mmol) necessary for the temporary protection of the aglycone carboxyl. Bis( tert -butyl) esters ( III ) and ( IV ) with free 30-COOH were purified by CC on silica gel in 50-52% yields. GA identified by TLC was the main impurity in the reaction products. The structures of the compounds were confirmed by spectral methods; in the spectra of 13 C NMR of ( III ) and ( IV ), there was a signal of the aglycone free COOH group at 180.3-180.7 ppm. Next, the esterification of ( III ) was carried out by a diazomethane ether solution with the subsequent OBu t deblocking of the formed triester by TFA in \u00eb\u00e7 2 \u00eb l 2 in the 30-methyl ester ( V ) in a 65% yield.",

The cytotoxic and antiviral activities of preparations were studied in a cul-ture of transferable human T lymphocytes (line MT-4) on a traditional model of acute HIV-1 infection with the use of the HIV-1/EVK strain [16] . GA at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g/ml and azidothymidine (Zydovudin, AZT), one of the most known anti-HIV-1 preparations, at concentration of 0.1 \u00b5g/ml [17, 18] were used as preparations for comparison. The AZT mechanism of action is connected with the inhibition of the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV, which provides reading of viral DNA in the infected cell from the RNA containing in virion (the transport form of the virus). However, with the passage of time, HIV-1 becomes resistant to the action of RT inhibitors. Therefore, recently AZT and its analogues have begun to be applied together with antiviral preparations with another action mechanism-protease inhibitors. Moreover, unlike GA, AZT is a toxic preparation [19] .",
