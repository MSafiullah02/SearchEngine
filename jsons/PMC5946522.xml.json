It is caused by the novel \u00df coronavirus MERS-(CoV).[1] Since its first appearance more than 1400 cases reported with mortality of these cases nearly 40% were identified in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV transmission within the community is mostly associated with close households and crowded living areas.[23] Dromedary camels were recognized as reservoirs of MERS-CoV and close contact with them denotes risk for MERS.[4] Within the health-care setups, disease was observed in outbreak clusters. Persons with middle and old ages with comorbidities found to be at high risk of MERS-CoV infections with higher mortality rate. MERS patients from KSA have shown 4.1 times higher 14-day mortality risk compared to patients from other countries.[5]",
