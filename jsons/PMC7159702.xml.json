The use of transport media to facilitate virus isolation was considered, but was thought to reduce the farmers' willingness to participate in this survey, because of the need to keep and ship the samples on ice, which would subsequently hinder the regularity of submissions and reduce the number of specimens collected. Upon arrival at the laboratory, however, the swabs were placed directly into lysis buffer for extraction of viral RNA and HRM curve analysis, and when a positive result was recorded, further swabs and/or tissue placed into transport media were requested. Numerous efforts were made throughout this study to obtain an isolate of IBV from layer flocks identified as IBV positive, but IBV could not be isolated from cloacal or oviduct swabs or directly from oviduct tissue of chickens after multiple passages through embryonated chicken eggs. The reasons for this are speculative, but may include that virus detected by PCR was potentially non\u2010infectious (i.e. remnants of a previous infection) or in some cases present at a low level.",

Serological analysis would not have provided useful data, because all flocks except for two were vaccinated multiple times to maintain high levels of IB immunity. Thus, although virus challenge might have occurred in immune hens, it would not have been detected in serological assays such as ELISA because there would be little detectable changes in the dominant cross\u2010reactive antibodies. Only tests that detect IBV serotype\u2010specific antibodies are useful for such purposes, and such tests are difficult and laborious. Therefore, PCR analysis, which is a simple and fast technique, was performed instead to detect the presence of viral RNA. This technique was successfully able to detect IBV RNA and hence identify IBV strains that were present in the hens at the time of sampling. The lack of recovery of an IBV isolate from layer chickens could also reflect the short duration and transitory nature of IBV infection, which is known to occur in immune hens.22\n",

How and when the Haugh units were measured for data collected on farm could not be controlled for this study, but based on discussions with each farmer, the data collected were assessed in line with standard procedures (Haugh units assessed against industry standards for hens' breed and age) to ensure the highest possible accuracy of the assessment of internal egg quality. Although these factors and inconsistencies lead to the conclusion that measurement of Haugh units is too subjective to be an effective measure of internal egg quality, measurement of the Haugh units, correlated with hen age, is the current industry standard for determination of egg quality.

This could suggest that potentially some Australian IBVs may have tropism for the oviduct, causing the production of poor\u2010quality eggs with reduced albumen quality. Although in controlled studies some Australian IBV strains have been shown to grow in and damage oviductal tissues,29, 30 there has not been a successful isolation of a field strain of IBV from the oviduct of layer hens producing poor\u2010quality eggs. Often other factors, besides infectious pathogens such as IBV, are involved in the production of poor\u2010quality eggs.21 Our study identified flock type as a potential risk factor; however, this risk factor is related to flock size (i.e. caged hens are housed at a higher density than free\u2010range hens and therefore caged flocks are generally larger than free\u2010range flocks). In terms of the effect of chicken breed on Haugh units, comparisons of Hy\u2010line Brown, Hisex and Isa Brown hens have consistently demonstrated that eggs produced by Hisex and Isa Brown hens have lower Haugh units than eggs produced by other brown\u2010egg layers.29, 47\n",

            "text": "International IB vaccination protocols include priming at an early age with a live IB vaccine followed by the use of inactivated vaccines (unavailable in Australia) prior to, and sometimes during, the lay period. This type of vaccination provides a more uniform level of immunity than live vaccines used periodically. Use of live vaccines in layers, as is currently practiced in Australia, is unconventional because it allows for possible reversion of vaccine virus to virulence and recirculation of the vaccine virus or vaccine\u2010related strains. This appeared to be the case in the present study, considering almost all the strains were identified as vaccine or vaccine\u2010related field strains. The regular use of live IBV vaccines throughout the life of a laying flock could potentially result in the emergence of new strains of IBV. This is supported by the results of a recent report that found viral subpopulations, with differing viral characteristics to the parent vaccine strain, in a commercial vaccine.49 However, it is difficult to predict whether chickens will be protected against new strains of IBV, even those strains that appear to be highly related to vaccine strains, with the current vaccines.",

Therefore, further investigation into the pathogenicity of V3/02\u2010related field strains (such as V3/02) is recommended, to assess their particular risk to the egg industry. Lastly, the efficacy of the current vaccination protocols in prevention of infection of chickens with these IBVs needs to be assessed with regard to whether vaccine A should be used more prominently in layer hens to prevent infection with V3/02 field strains or whether the use of these vaccines on some farms is perpetuating the spread and persistence of V3/02 strains in commercial layer flocks.",
