Most of the cases that were left without a diagnosis occurred in the low-risk patient group and among younger patients, suggesting either that there is less pathogen present for detection or that an unidentified organism was present that may cause less severe disease. Respiratory pathogens previously undetected are continuously being discovered; metapneumovirus is an example, and recently, coronavirus NL63 [41, 42] has been described in a child with pneumonia [41] .
