Blood and respiratory samples were collected from patients and tested for bacterial and viral pathogens by multiple modalities including bacterial culture, realtime polymerase chain reaction, and serology with methods as previously described. 3 We identified 3 distinct groups for analysis: children with neurologic disorders, children with non-neurologic underlying conditions, and children with no underlying conditions. We categorized disorders as neurologic disorders based on literature review. 16, 22 In addition, we consulted with a behavior-development pediatrician (G.P.) to assist with categorizing neurologic disorders. Only those with possible neurologic sequelae attributable to the neurologic disorder as indicated from the literature were categorized as neurologic disorders. We defined neurologic disorders as a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, developmental delay, Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome chromosomal abnormalities, epilepsy, spinal cord abnormalities, and other neurologic disorders; if a child had a neurologic disorder and another non-neurologic underlying condition, he or she was categorized as having a neurologic disorder. Non-neurologic underlying conditions included asthma/ reactive airway disease (RAD), other chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, congenital heart disease, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive conditions (either because of chronic conditions, medication use, HIV-infection with CD4 cell count >200 cells/mm 3 , and nondermatologic malignancies), and pre-term birth (in those aged <2 years old, defined as born at <37 weeks gestation).

We compared epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, outcomes, and pathogens detected among children with neurologic disorders, nonneurologic underlying conditions, and no underlying conditions.

We also examined other clinical outcomes including hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, invasive mechanical ventilation requirement and duration, receipt of vasopressors within 72 hours of ICU admission, and death. We performed bivariate and separate age-stratified analyses comparing the characteristics between children with neurologic disorders vs non-neurologic underlying conditions, and neurologic disorders vs no underlying conditions. In addition, we conducted subgroup analyses comparing the clinical outcomes of the subset of children with neurologic disorders and no other non-neurologic underlying conditions to the outcomes of children with non-neurologic underlying conditions and no underlying conditions; however, for our primary analysis, the neurologic disorders group includes children with a neurologic disorder who may also have non-neurologic disorders because there were few differences in the outcomes between these groups and because of sample size. We performed multivariable logistic regression using stepwise elimination to further investigate clinical outcomes found to be more common among children with neurologic disorders; covariates for the regression models were based on significance on bivariate analysis and epidemiologic or biological plausibility.",

Children with neurologic disorders comprise a small proportion of the US pediatric population, but the heterogeneity of the disorders limit a single prevalence estimate. The estimated prevalence of epilepsy is 390 per 100 000 children and cerebral palsy is 240 per 100 000 children. 4 The estimated prevalence of birth defects range from a prevalence of 0.8-3.5 per 100 000 live births for disorders such anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocele, and chromosomal abnormalities except for Down syndrome, which is more common (14.5 per 100 000 live births). 6 Despite being uncommon in the general population, children with neurologic disorders have been reported to account for 5.3% of all pediatric hospitalizations. 13 In a study using US claims data, investigators found that 11% of children hospitalized with respiratory infections had neurologic disorders. 22 This is nearly identical to the proportion of children with neurologic disorders seen in our study. Compared with children with non-neurologic underlying conditions and children with no underlying conditions, children with neurologic disorders in our study were older and more often had coexisting congenital heart disease (30.4%) and chronic lung disease (12.5%). This reflects the burden of chronic disease and medical complexity in this population. [8] [9] [10] Overall, children with neurologic disorders were more likely to require ICU admission, our primary outcome of severe illness. However, on multivariate analysis the association between neurologic disorder and ICU admission remained only for children $2 years of age. The reasons for this finding are not entirely clear and the EPIC dataset did not include reason for ICU admission. However, there are several possible reasons for this finding. First, it is possible that there was increased disability with increasing age or related to specific neurologic disorders, but we do not have detailed neurologic or functionality information in the EPIC dataset to assess this hypothesis. Second, it is possible that younger children with certain neurologic disorders, which were included in the case definition (such as epilepsy or developmental delay), may not have been fully diagnosed and, therefore, were not formally classified as having a neurologic disorder. Third, it is possible that children with neurologic disorders may have increasing disability with age because of their neurologic disorder alone (eg, impaired cough reflex) such that they were admitted to the ICU for aspiration risk and increased monitoring or treatment such as suctioning. Lastly, clinicians may have been more likely to admit all children younger than 2 years regardless of any underlying medical condition to the ICU for a respiratory admission for increased monitoring or treatment, thus, the effect of having a neurologic disorder would be decreased in this younger age group.",

Interestingly and specifically rhinovirus, adenovirus, and RSV were all less frequently detected in children with neurologic disorders compared with children with non-neurologic medical conditions, of which asthma/RAD was most common; although we did not further stratify by underlying medical condition, these viruses have been associated with asthma and RAD in previous studies. 26, 27 Importantly, respiratory virus detections were more common than bacterial detections among children with neurologic disorders, as was also true for all other children hospitalized with CAP. In addition, the frequency of co-detections and specific pathogens detected were generally similar in all 3 groups. Per the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines, all children >6 months of age and older should receive an annual influenza vaccination. 28 Although our analysis demonstrated that children with neurologic disorders were more likely to have received influenza vaccination compared with children with no underlying condition (41.7% vs 28.7%), this is well below the Healthy People 2020 target (70%) for annual pediatric influenza vaccination. [29] [30] [31] This finding highlights that clinicians should strongly support influenza vaccination in these children.

            "text": "These findings are subject to several limitations. First, data on the functional status of children enrolled in the EPIC study were not collected. Thus, we were unable to classify the degree of disability or ability to manage secretions caused by different neurologic disorders and the potential impact on outcomes. Similarly, we acknowledge that the neurologic disorders group is heterogeneous, but we used definitions that have been reported previously. In addition, in the assessment of specific disorders, although our numbers were small in any 1 group, the clinical outcomes of the overall population of children with neurologic disorders and those of the subset of children with neurologic disorders and no other comorbidities were similar. Second, children with preexisting tracheostomy were excluded from this study, which may have excluded some of the children who are most severely neurologically compromised who have the highest risk for pneumonia. Third, aspiration can occur frequently in children with neurologic disorders, 14, 15, 33 and it is possible that the lower proportion of pathogens detected in children with neurologic disorders was related to aspiration pneumonia when an etiologic agent was not detected. Sputum samples were not collected routinely in the children, and very few endotracheal aspirates were obtained in our study. Fourth, although we used a comprehensive array of diagnostic methods, detection of a pathogen does not necessarily denote causation. 3 Fifth, we did not have data on the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, thus, we are unable to describe all potential forms of respiratory support that may have been used during hospitalization. Sixth, the threshold and reasons for ICU admission vary among clinicians and institutions and, thus, have limitations as a marker for severity. Although we did not collect information on reason for ICU admission, we did find that most children admitted to the ICU had tachypnea, hypoxia, or altered mental status; however, there may be other factors, including clinician preferences or other nonclinical factors, for which we did not account. Finally, our study sites were tertiary care children's hospitals, and the array of neurologic disorders and overall medical complexity in these patients may differ from those seen in nonreferral centers. This may have had a limited effect, however, because patients with more complex neurologic disorders would likely be referred to specialty centers regardless of the acute illness. 13 We demonstrated that children $2 years old with neurologic disorders were more likely to require ICU admission after controlling for asthma/RAD, congenital heart disease, hypoxia, and tachypnea. Overall, when stratified by age, the proportion of children with a detected pathogen was lower among children with neurologic disorders compared to children without neurologic disorders. Given the high proportion of and increased risk of severe illness among children with neurologic conditions hospitalized with CAP in our study, our findings underscore the vulnerable nature of children, the need for immunization in this population, and the requirement for comprehensive respiratory care in this vulnerable population. n PCR, polymerase chain reaction. *Results reflect pathogen detection based on sampling and pathogen definitions previously described. 3 Proper sampling methodology was defined for bacterial detections as blood culture or whole blood PCR or pleural fluid culture or PCR or endotracheal aspirate culture or bronchoalveolar lavage culture results and for viral detections as a nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab PCR or viral serology results. \u2020Histoplasma capsulatum was detected in 2 patients. zIncludes coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43. NA, not applicable. *Other condition includes chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, and history of splenectomy. \u2020Tachypnea is defined as $60 breaths per min in infants <2 mo; $50 breaths per min in infants $2 mo to <12 mo; $40 breaths per min in children $1 y to <5 y; and $25 breaths per min in $5 y to <18 y. zHypoxia is defined as an oxygen saturation <92% on presentation or the receipt of any supplemental oxygen on presentation. xHypotension is defined as a systolic blood pressure <60 mm Hg in infants <1 mo; <70 mm Hg in infants $1 mo to <1 y; <70 mm Hg + (2 mm Hg * age in y) in children $1 y to <10 y; and <90 in children $10 y.
