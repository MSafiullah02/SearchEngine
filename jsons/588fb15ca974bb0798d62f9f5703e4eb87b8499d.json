Often the best that can be managed initially is a rough estimate, but this can usually be refined later. It is helpful to use several methods and cross-check the figures to obtain the best estimate. Surrogates of the whole population (such as those attending a clinic) may be the best that can be achieved early on. The ease with which such data can be obtained usually depends on the size and scale of the population under consideration. The demography of a well-run refugee camp is quite easy to obtain but that of a larger area may be much more difficult.

Sentinel surveillance systems are inherently less satisfactory than comprehensive systems largely because they provide a much less complete coverage. The calculation of rates can sometimes be difficult or impossible; such systems can be very labour intensive, and important events may be missed. Both types of system may rely on notification of cases based solely on clinical evidence (and this is the most likely situation in conflicts and disasters at least in the early stages), or may include laboratory verification of some or (preferably) all diagnoses.
