Several studies have established the expected rates of HAIs in children hospitalized in general care wards and have defined the most common types of HAIs, the organisms responsible, and the risk factors. Rates of HAIs have generally been defined as the number of HAIs divided by the number of patients at risk times 100. The denominator is usually the number of admissions or discharges in the unit studied. This rate is sometimes expressed as a percentage. Risk may also be calculated according to the rate of infection per day of hospitalization. This is usually expressed as number of HAIs or specific types of HAIs such as bloodstream infections (BSI), or infection associated with the presence of certain devices (e.g., urinary catheters, assisted ventilation) per 100, 1,000, or 10,000 patient-days or device-days.",

Clinical ward rounds by a trained surveyor generally yields the most information but other sources may add information not available at the bedside or the patient\u2019s chart. Table\n66.2 lists the relative sensitivity of various sources of data indicating that active surveillance on a continuous basis is the most accurate method and data obtained from either the microbiology laboratory or the pharmacy is considerably less sensitive. Relying on clinicians to report nosocomial infections to a central collection point (passive surveillance) is notoriously inaccurate and greatly underestimates the rate of infection. Total daily hospital bedside surveillance is usually impractical as there is often neither sufficient time nor personnel to carry it out. Therefore, intensive surveillance is often limited to the highest-risk units such as the intensive care units, oncology units, and surveillance of surgical procedure outcomes.\n\n",

They found a 6.5% overall rate of hospital-acquired infections.

In an early report, Hemming and associates demonstrated a high rate of nosocomial infections (24.6%) at the University of Utah Medical Center, neonatal regional ICU for infants hospitalized for greater than 48 h. By comparison, the nosocomial infection rate for the entire hospital was 7.3%. It was 5.4% for the general pediatric ward and 0.6% for the well-baby nursery. In another study of nosocomial infection in a neonatal ICU from Boston, it was hypothesized that proper staffing, adequate working space around incubators, control of traffic flow, and the presence of convenient scrub areas would decrease the rate of nosocomial infections. This was confirmed in a prospective study when a new nursery was built with improvements in all of these areas. The nosocomial infection rate for serious infections fell from 5.2% to 0.9%. The rates in this study were lower than in others because the unit transferred out newborns who required surgery. In the Pediatric Prevention Network study, the overall nosocomial infection rate was 8.9 per 1,000 patient-days, the bloodstream infection rate in the NICU was a median of 8.6 per 1,000 central venous catheter-days, and the ventilator-associated pneumonia rate was a mean of 2.5 per 1,000 ventilator-days. For all categories, the infection rates were inversely proportional to the birthweight.

Most of the earlier studies were in adult populations. Studies from the Denver Veterans Administration Hospital by Selden and associates attempted to quantify the factors associated with risk of infection from a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was the cause of a large cluster of nosocomial infections, primarily in ICU patients, and was resistant to multiple antibiotics. They found that asymptomatic gastrointestinal colonization frequently preceded manifest infection. In a prevalence study, it was shown that 18% of those who were GI carriers of the Klebsiella strain had an infection due to the organism during their admission, while only 3% of those who were not colonized were infected. In a separate prospective longitudinal study, those who became carriers of Klebsiella during hospitalization, but were culture-negative on admission, had a 48% incidence of nosocomial Klebsiella infection. Length of hospitalization was another major factor. The rate of colonization rose steeply after 3 days of hospitalization to a maximum prevalence of 66% for those who were hospitalized for longer than 30 days. The therapeutic interventions associated with acquisition of Klebsiella in the gastrointestinal tract were inhalation therapy, nasogastric suction, and antibiotic therapy. These factors probably account for the high rates of HAI in patients who have been in an ICU. These findings were validated in subsequent studies.",

The prevalence of pharyngeal colonization with gram-negative bacilli was studied in Texas by Johanson and associates. Colonization rate was proportional to the estimated degree of illness: it was low (2%) in physiologically normal inpatients and nonhospitalized normal subjects; moderately ill patients had a 16% rate of colonization, and moribund patients had a rate of 57%. It was assumed that the sicker patients had defective clearance mechanisms and that they also had more contact with contaminated materials. Patients receiving antibiotics also had a higher prevalence of gram-negative bacilli in the pharynx. This is attributed to the suppression of normal flora by antibiotics, allowing new organisms to colonize mucosal surfaces. Although pharyngeal colonization does not mean that there is active infection, it frequently precedes invasion, especially in patients who aspirate or already have other respiratory infections.",

Established colonization with numerous organisms of low virulence limits dominance of any one species, and minimizes acquisition of exogenous pathogenic organisms. The mechanisms by which indigenous flora afford protection include competition for the host nutrient sources (bacterial interference), and blocking of cell-surface receptors or mucus blanket adhesions by other bacteria (colonization resistance). Both normal flora as well as pathogens appear to attach to human tissue by very specific binding between specialized surface elements of the microorganisms (pili, and other specific proteins and carbohydrates) and molecules on the skin and mucosal surfaces. There is some evidence that if normal flora microorganisms, principally nonpathogenic bacteria and fungi, are abundant, there are very few molecules on host surfaces for pathogens to attach to. However, the more numerous and well-established normal flora can be partially or totally eradicated by the use of antibiotics. Should normal flora be lacking, new flora will more easily attach to the exposed receptor molecules on these surfaces. If these new flora have pathogenic potential, such as the ability to invade, generate toxins, or resist antibiotics they may proliferate more quickly than the normal flora can regenerate. This is felt to be the major mechanism for the spread of antibiotic-resistant flora in the hospital because so many patients have a disturbance of their usual normal flora.",

Spread of viruses does not appear to be as clearly related to contaminated equipment, antibiotic use, or inanimate reservoirs as is found in bacterial infection. Viral infections are introduced by infected patients, healthcare workers, or parents, and then spread to patients via infected secretions or direct person-to-person spread. Almost any virus that is spread by respiratory or gastrointestinal tract secretions or excreta can cause HAI if routine care techniques are not enforced or if a particularly infectious virus disease goes undetected. Strict observance of special transmission-based precautions (Droplet, contact or both, see Table\n66.4) plus respiratory etiquette (Table\n66.5) are important in limiting spread in healthcare setting. Surveillance studies have indicated certain viruses discussed below to be of special concern for nosocomial infections in pediatrics.\n\n",

Infants with congenital cardiac disease and those with pulmonary disease such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia are at especial risk. Studies have shown that transmission by close contact is responsible for dissemination to noninfected individuals; aerosols traveling a considerable distance are not a major factor. Appropriate handwashing as well as limiting of number of contacts should be emphasized as the major means of infection control.

Infection control experts consider hand hygiene to be the single most effective and certainly least expensive practice to prevent transmission of pathogens and prevention of HAI. Nevertheless, one recent review documents that even this simple directive has been insufficiently adhered to by medical personnel. In a review of 12 published studies, compliance with recommended hand hygiene was under 50% even in intensive care units. Proper handwashing methodology is summarized in Table\n66.7. For handwashing, other than presurgical scrubs, hands should be vigorously lathered and rubbed together for at least 15 s with soap and warm running water. Hands should be rinsed and dried with a paper towel and the towel used to turn off the faucet. Gloves should be worn when touching blood or other body fluids and mucous membranes, to reduce the likelihood of transmitting organisms to patients during invasive procedures, and to prevent transmission of pathogens from an infected patient to another patient. Wearing gloves does not replace the need for handwashing. Adherence to handwashing recommendations is important as contamination of skin due to punctures or defects in a glove is possible. With the widespread use of alcohol-based hand rubs, there is evidence of improvement in hand hygiene compliance among healthcare personnel at many healthcare centers.",
