A link prediction task aims to predict whether there is an existing link between any two nodes. We follow the evaluation framework for link prediction as stated in [10, 19] . We create a Logistic Regression classifier for dynamic link predictions. We sample 20% of edges from the last time step snapshot as the held-out validation set for hyper-parameter tuning. The rest of edges of the last time step snapshot are used for link prediction task. In specific, we choose randomly 25% of links and the remaining 75% of links as training and test set respectively. An equal number of randomly sampled pairs of nodes without link as negative examples for each training and test set respectively. We use the inner product of the node embeddings of the node-pair as the representation feature of the link.
