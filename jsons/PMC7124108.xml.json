It has been hypothesized that the virus originated from wild waterfowls and has only slowly evolved through multiple animal species including humans.8 But what is known about the disease caused by the virus\u2014influenza\u2014is that it is a febrile illness of the upper and lower respiratory tract, characterized by a sudden onset of fever, cough, myalgia, and malaise. Pneumonia is a principal serious complication9 and local symptoms include sniffles, nasal discharge, dry cough, and sore throat.10 Pandemic influenza outbreaks describe the rapid spread of influenza infection . Whereas there is some conceptual controversy about the description and definition of pandemics,11 they generally refer to the dissemination of new infective diseases to which immunity has not been developed in a widespread manner across a significant part of the world.12 They could break out in nations with a large geographical size (such as China, India, and the United States) or when the number of affected nations are many.",

Contemporary society experiences an increased development of new serotypes of several kinds of respiratory viruses because of the evolutionary potential afforded by the human population explosion and the great global increase in human mobility.16 In a manner of speaking, it seems that PHDs such as pandemic influenza outbreaks have evolved to become recurring features of the human experience. Some insights into the biological features and processes that create pandemic outbreaks support this idea.",

This comprises seven genera including influenza virus A, B, C, and D.17 Although both the genus influenzavirus A and B affect humans and cause pandemics,18 influenza A has been the principal culprit in known outbreaks to the extent that four major pandemics have resulted from it (1918\u20131919, 1957, 1968, and 2009).19 However, genetic re-assortment and exchange of influenza viruses between humans and animals generate antigenic shift, which periodically introduces new viruses to the human population. This, in addition to mutation and selection, produces antigenic drift that accounts for the year-to-year variations in influenza A subtypes.20 Wild ducks, for instance, serve as the primary host for various influenza type A viruses that occasionally spread to other host species and cause outbreaks in such animals as fowl, swine, and horses. Such outbreaks often lead to new human pandemics21 due to novel viruses infecting immunologically na\u00efve people.22 A critical aspect of the emergence of novel virus strains is genetic variation and combination that occur at the hemagglutinin (HA) antigens (of which there are 16) and neuraminidase (NA) enzymes (of which there are nine)23 between and amongst human and animal influenza viruses.",

However, it is not known when any will occur or whether it will be caused by the H5N1 avian-derived influenza virus, newer subtypes like H7N9, or completely novel subtypes. Virologists like Webster and Govorkova argue that given the number of cases of H5N1 influenza that have occurred in humans (more than 251) with a mortality or death rate of more than 50%, it would be prudent to develop robust plans for dealing with such pandemic influenza and its (expected) new variations.30 Such plans, however, necessarily demand attention to the associated ethical dynamics.

The 2009 influenza outbreak, for instance, spread to 85 countries and caused a total of 39, 620 cases of infection .50 In short, in a globalized world, infectious diseases travel in nodes of human, material, and animal networks.51\n",

In clinical trials, antiviral treatments have been shown to be efficacious in preventing infection, hence, slowing down transmission as well as limiting the severity of the disease.65 But the effectiveness of neuraminidase such as oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir at reducing mortality is uncertain.66 In addition, there is some evidence of side-effects. For instance, in adults as in children, oseltamivir increases the risk of nausea and vomiting. Also, treatment trials with oseltamivir or zanamivir do not settle the question of whether the complications of influenza (such as pneumonia) are reduced.67 Resistance to these anti-viral drugs has also been reported, even in people who have never been previously treated with them.68 Ultimately, the success of antiviral prophylaxis critically depends on the identification of index cases in households, pre-schools, schools, and other institutional settings.69 This clearly highlights the importance of personal, social, and institutional cooperation in relation to dealing with the associated challenges.",

A communitarian ethos is useful in at least two ways in relation to dealing with the uncertainties associated with pandemic influenza. Generally, it can\u2014with the right pre-disaster public education\u2014help ensure that people understand the unavoidable scientific and knowledge-related gaps in preparedness policies and specific plans put together to engage a specific outbreak. This will help avoid or minimize blame, since scapegoating during disease outbreaks causes different shades of disruption and target important actors including health workers.157 In fact, the better educated the public is about the challenges of stockpiling vaccines, the more cooperative they will likely be to the vaccine-supply challenges that arise during an outbreak.",

These harms arise from the uncertain nature of what is knowable about a pandemic virus before it strikes as well as the biological limits of the therapeutic arsenals often produced within a very narrow time window. This is also generally tied to the reality that new health interventions including drugs and vaccines come with the possibility of some adverse events, which may be linked to the chemical/biological/physical components of the product, to genetic susceptibilities in certain individuals, or to environmental triggers.158 Keeping the public aware of this fact before and during an outbreak as well as emphasizing that accepting these risks (though uncomfortable at the individual plane) will serve to ensure the society overcome a pandemic should help garner some level of support critical to ensure proper compliance.",

This is especially so if the people whose rights may be inhibited or violated do not consent to the process. To avert this, a discursive approach involving inclusive deliberations is essential. In this vein, the communitarian lens can help foster dialogue as well as call for the need to reward people for the sacrifices they may or will bear on behalf of the community\nand the society. For instance, guaranteeing that some compensation will be paid for financial losses incurred through workplace closure as well as apt public education about the nature, purposes, and conditions of quarantine facilities will help convince people that such temporary rights-related inconveniences are for the benefits of the overall society.",

Based on these distinctions, it can help underscore how context-specific cooperation will help ensure the overall success of the countermeasures adopted to engage a given pandemic. Critical to this, however, is the moral currency of trust. Trust shapes how the public evaluates risks and benefits. It also influences the acceptance of prescribed public measures to mitigate present or perceived risks.159 Effective risk and crisis communication depend on public trust in the government during a pandemic. As such, a higher level of trust will influence a more positive level of social compliance. van der Weerd and colleagues corroborated this in their empirical study of the 2009 pandemic in the Netherlands.160\n",

Since every nation lacks an equal capacity to deal with the local burdens of pandemic influenza, it is necessary for wealthier nations to rally around poorer ones. Indeed, the transcontinental nature of health disasters including pandemic influenza and SARS underscores the urgent need to strengthen how the global community deals with emerging infectious diseases, and how novel visions of global solidarity and cooperation will be key in such an endeavor.163 This constitutes a preventive stance and falls well within the traditional agenda of public health.

Secondly, contexts of duty exist between some of the players and victims of disasters which form the basis of a relationship of caring. For instance, healthcare professionals incur fiduciary duties to at-risk people, victims of a public health disaster as well as the general populace that may potentially be infected and infect others.

In non-familial carer and cared-for relationships involving at-risk government representatives and at-risk members of the society and familial relationships involving parents and children living in the same house, an appeal to a care ethical lens may help drive the moral sensitivity to the needs of others, enabling some vaccine-eligible persons (under the standard rationing criteria) to forgo their ration, preferring rather that other at-risk people (for example, ordinary people and younger family members) have them.
