One spectrum is that of the considerable changes that we see in surgical machines and equipment, and the way the procedures are performed. Computing power, Internet and associated technologies are transforming surgical operations into model based procedures. The other spectrum is the management side of healthcare, which is equally critical to the medical profession. In particular, recent advances in the field of Information Technology (IT) is assisting in better management of health appointments and record management. With the proliferation of IT and management, data is now playing a vital role in diagnostics, drug administration and management of healthcare services. With the advancement in data processing, large amounts of medical data collected by medical centres and providers, can now be mined and analysed to assist in planning and making appropriate decisions. In this article, we shall provide an overview of the role of IT that have been reshaping the healthcare management, hospital, health profession and industry.",

Barely 20 years ago, we had not imagined the technological advancements, which are now implemented into our lives. Technological advancement, riding on the wave of disruptive technologies of the last quarter of a century, is reshaping and redefining the world's social order and norms. The medical field is part and parcel of our lives and is perhaps one that we care the most about. In the recent times, this field has undergone vast changes. The medical profession today has evolved greatly since the beginning of this century. Not only the medical procedures, the medical data flow and management has also undergone considerable improvement. Advance data transfer and management techniques have made improvements in disease diagnostic and have been a critical role in national health planning and efficient record keeping. In particular, the medical profession has undergone substantial changes through the capabilities of database management, which has given rise to the Healthcare Information Systems (HIS). Medical data collected from different institutions can now be mined and analysed in time using Big Data Analytics tools.",

Nevertheless, robots are now days being utilised to assist in or perform many complex medical procedures, which has given rise to the term Robotic Surgery.

To keep the environment free of these viruses and bacteria, the environments needs to be cleaned efficiently and regularly. However some viruses like Ebola [2] and MERs Coronavirus [12] are highly contagious and cannot be cleaned by humans without having protective gear, which can be costly and may or may not be effective. Cleaning the hospital with chlorine is an effective way. However, there are many drawbacks of this method including a high risk for cleaners to be infected themselves. A sophisticated approach was implemented in US hospitals by using robots [13] to purify the space. However, some of the robots used are not motorized and may require a human to place them in the infected room or area, posing the risk of infection to humans. It is not known as to which substance or matter can effectively eliminate deadly viruses like Ebola and MERs Coronavirus. However, according to [14] , beta-Coronaviruses, which is one of the four strands of MERs Coronavirus, can be effectively eliminated by UV light. For such a deadly and highly contagious virus clearing, a robot that can be remote controlled is needed, which can move forward, backward and sideways, and is able to clean itself.",

Not only did it change paper based systems to electronic ones but also allowed data manipulation. As a result, more data could be processed in a very short time, which was critical in making timely decisions. A discussion of early stages of this transformation can be found in [22] . Consolidation of this technology resulted in Healthcare Management Information Systems (HMIS). Timely decision is critical in all walks of life but it assumes a much greater urgency in some healthcare cases. HMIS is capable to transferring data from one location or application to another within split of a second, as opposed to days without the help of electronic systems. This allows users to access, use and manipulate data instantly and concurrently. As the technology continues to evolve and refine, the performance of information systems operations, in particular those of HMIS, is bound to improve.",

Organisational data needs to be mined and analysed on a regular basis to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customers, patients and treatment records to help organizations to plan and make more informed decisions. Mining and analysis of big data captures the immense wealth of intelligence hidden in organisational data, makes information transparent and usable at much higher frequency, and enhance performance. All of these contribute to providing higher value in efficient decision making. When data grows, it cannot be handled manually, often big data organisations use robotic arm to perform data loading and unloading operations. Medical data is also growing at a rapid rate in many hospitals, clinics and insurance companies. Mining and analysis of healthcare data is even more critical as it relates to the wellbeing of the society. Data centric research is highly desirable to find answers to questions on many chronical diseases, and to plan and manage national and international health programs. Potential befits of big data analytics in healthcare are discussed in [32] . In particular, authors have provided five strategies for success with big data. These are (1) implementing big data governance, (2) developing an information sharing culture, (3) training key personnel to use big data analytics, (4) incorporating cloud computing into the organization's big data analytics, and (5) generating new business ideas from big data analytics. A survey of big data analytics in healthcare and government is conducted in [33] , where the need for the analytics is linked to the provision and improvement of patient centric services, detection of diseases before they spread, monitoring the quality of services in hospitals, improving methods of treatment, and provision of quality medical education. Authors in [34] identify medical signals as a major source of big data, discuss analytical techniques of such data. Some of the well known tools used for big data analytics are Apache TM Hadoop \u00d2 is highly scalable storage platform. It provides cost-effective storage solution for large data volumes. It doesn't require any particular format. Apache Spark is an open source, in-memory processing machine. Its performance is much faster than that of Hadoop. MapReduce is used for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining.",

With medical data these concerns assumes higher pronounce and priority. Medical data can be very sensitive, and may be linked to life and death of the patients. Often socio political issues are linked with medical data. It is well known that India was divided into two countries giving rise to Pakistan in 1947. Mohammad Ali Jinnah, very clever and shrewd, was the leader of Pakistan campaign, Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre [35] argue that the partition of India could have been avoided if ''the most closely guarded secret in India'' had become known. Jinnah was suffering from tuberculosis which was slowly but surely killing him. In [28, 36, 37] , privacy issues of data are discussed.",
