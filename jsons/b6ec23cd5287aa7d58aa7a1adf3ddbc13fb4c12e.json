These downstream ORFs are interspaced with the accessory ORFs thought to be nonstructural proteins of unknown function (ORF3a/b, ORF6, ORF7a/b, ORF8a/b, and ORF9b). 8 The accessory ORFs likely influence the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV, as the accessory ORFs of other coronaviruses contribute to in vivo pathogenesis but are not essential for growth in vitro ( Figure 1 ).",

We found that all viruses with any of the accessory ORFs deleted replicated to similar titers in Vero, MA104, and Caco cells, approaching10 7 pfu in ~24 hr (data not shown). We then tested the mutant viruses in a mouse model by intranasal inoculation. In this system, lungs were harvested 2 days postinfection and virus extracted from the tissue and analyzed by plaque assay. We found no significant differences between the wild-type Urbani strain, our icSARS strain, and any of the mutants deleted for the accessory ORFs ( Figure 2 ). This lead us to postulate two conclusions. First, the accessory ORFs may not encode critical functions in viral pathogenesis. In other viruses that encode accessory ORFs, deletion of these genes allows for in vitro growth; however, some attenuate while others have little impact on protein. 10 Alternatively, 150 in vivo pathogenesis. In SARS-CoV, it is possible that these accessory ORFs encode minor effects on in vivo pathogenesis. Such a result is surprising given data suggesting that ORF3a and ORF7 induce apoptosis and that ORF3a is a structural Lung Titer Greater than 10 6 + + + + + + Figure 2 . Balb-C mice were infected intranasally with 1\u00d710 5 virus. Lungs were dissected and virus titer assayed 2 dpi. Shown are the deletion strains tested in this model. A plus (+) denotes those viruses that grew to higher than 10 6 pfu/ml of mouse lung. ORF7a is ORF7a and ORF7b. the current mouse model may not be sufficiently robust for dissecting out the role of the accessory ORFs in SARS-CoV pathogenesis. We have found that although SARS does infect mouse lungs, it fails to have any pathogenic effect on the animal, and virus is cleared from the infected mouse by day 5. New model systems, such as ferrets and human airway epithelial cultures, will need to be developed to investigate further roles of the accessory ORFs in pathogenesis.",

            "text": "We tested whether one or more accessory ORFs of SARS might interfere with the host innate immunity and interferon signaling, resulting in increased pathogenicity in vivo. The innate immune response includes IFN signaling, cytokine activation, and antiviral proteins and is essential for host clearance of invading viral pathogens. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the induction of several interferon response genes upon SARS infection. Vero and 293 cells were transfected with constructs with promoters of normally induced antiviral genes, driving luciferase to assay expression. We found that Interferon (IFN) beta, NFkB, and p65 are not induced upon SARS infection, however they are highly upregulated upon Sendai virus infection. When the same assay was tested with the deletion mutants described above, identical results were obtained. We found no induction of IFN beta, NFkB, or p65 upon infection. NFkB should be induced upon viral infection from sensing of virus and activation by IKK; p56 should be induced by IRF3 signaling via sensing of viral replication products. We conclude that SARS is either blocking induction of the antiviral response of infected cells or functionally invisible to these response elements, which may be important in its initial survival when infecting a host. We also find that deletion of individual accessory ORFs does not diminish this modulation of the immune response.",

The direct manipulation of the genome of SARS will allow us to discern the function of the accessory ORFs contained in the virus as well and better understand the roles of the nonstructural ORFs in the virus. These data suggest that ORF3a is a nonessential structural gene and that ORF3b, ORF6, and ORF7a/b are nonessential.
