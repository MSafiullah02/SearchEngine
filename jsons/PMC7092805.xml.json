Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara, Japan) was used in all PCRs. In the first forward primer, tissue plasminogen activator (Tpa) signal sequence (MDAMKRGLCCVLLLCGAVFVSA) was introduced to replace the original signal peptide of the S gene (MFIFLLFLTLTSG). The chimeric wild-type S with Tpa was named TS, the synthetic S gene with Tpa was named TSh. Sequences were determined by sequencing and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 (+) vector to generate pTS and pTSh.",

It not only binds to the cellular receptor but also initiates membrane fusion [14], [15], [16], [17]. To develop the pseudotyped virus system for studying SARS-CoV entry, we initially transfected pTS containing the native S gene into 293T cells, but found that the expression of the S protein in transfected cells was too weak to be detected either by FACS or Western blot (Figs. 1\nA and B). The poor expression from the native S gene might be due to codon bias, since the native S gene had a codon usage that differed substantially from those of human genes (Fig. 1C). We therefore synthesized a humanized S gene (TSh) in which native codons were replaced with the degenerate codons used most frequently in human genes. When the pTSh was transfected into 293T cells, the S protein could be easily detected by FACS analysis (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of lysates from the pTSh transfected 293T cells showed two major protein bands that reacted with anti-S sera: a 180 kDa protein corresponding to the previously described size for the mature S protein on SARS-CoV virions [18] and a 130 kDa protein consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the nonglycosylated precursors of the S protein (Fig. 1B).",

Our data showed that Vero E6 and MDCK were susceptible to HIV/SARS infection (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the infection pattern of the wild-type SARS-CoV [3], [19]. To determine whether the infectivity of HIV/SARS can be mediated by S protein and was SARS-CoV specific, we incubated the pseudotyped virus with sera from convalescent SARS patients before adding them onto Vero E6 cells for infection. We showed that convalescent SARS patients\u2019 sera had a high neutralizing activity on SARS-CoV pseudotypes, while they failed to neutralize pseudotypes with VSV G glycoprotein (Fig. 2C). This result indicated that the entry process of SARS-CoV was mediated by S protein and this mechanism is similar to those of murine hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus [16], [17].",

The other is receptor-mediated endocytosis in which low pH within the endosome is required to trigger membrane fusion. Inhibitors of vacuolar acidification, such as ammonium chloride, can prevent virus entry through the latter pathway [28]. To assess through which pathway HIV/SARS used to enter the cell, we treated the Huh7 cells with ammonium chloride before infection. Pseudotyped viruses HIV/VSV-G and HIV/AMLV demonstrating pH-dependent and independent entry were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Infectivity of HIV/SARS and HIV/VSV-G, but not HIV/AMLV, was similarly diminished by ammonium chloride (Fig. 5\n). Treatment with 30 mM ammonium chloride caused complete inhibition of infection by HIV/SARS (Fig. 5). This result was consistent with the recent report by Yang et al. [29]. The pH dependency of infection indicated that the entry of HIV/SARS into host cells was most likely mediated by endocytosis.",
