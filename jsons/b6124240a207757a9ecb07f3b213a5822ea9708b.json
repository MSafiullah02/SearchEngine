With the exception of three species of conifers, all natural polyploid species of gymnosperms belong to Ephedra, in which more than half of the species show polyploid cytotypes. Here, we investigated the origin and evolution of polyploids of Ephedra distributed in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and neighbouring areas. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to measure the ploidy levels of the sampled species that are represented by multiple individuals from different populations, and then, two single-copy nuclear genes (LFY and DDB2) and two chloroplast DNA fragments were used to unravel the possible origins and maternal donors of the polyploids. The results indicate that the studied polyploid species are allopolyploids, and suggest that allotetraploidy is a dominant mode of speciation in Ephedra. The high percentage of polyploids in the genus could be related to some of its biological attributes such as vegetative propagation, a relatively high rate of unreduced gamete formation, and a small genome size relative to most other gymnosperms. Significant ecological divergences between allotetraploids and their putative progenitors were detected by PCAs and ANOVA and Tukey's tests, with the exception of E. saxatilis. The overlap of geographical distributions and ecological niches of some diploid species could have provided opportunities for interspecific hybridization and allopolyploid speciation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Polyploidy or whole-genome duplication (WGD) has long been recognized as an important process in plant evolution (Otto & Whitton 2000; Soltis et al. 2009 ).

Polyploidy may have broad-scale effects on genomic repatterning, gene expression and genetic networks due to the inheritance of an additional set of chromosomes, and can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system and ecological tolerances (Otto 2007; Soltis et al. 2010; Fawcett et al. 2013; Weiss-Schneeweiss et al. 2013) , although some studies found no correlation between polyploidization rate and species richness (Wood et al. 2009; Mayrose et al. 2011) .

Fig. 6 A reticulate network constructed from the reduced 50% majority-rule consensus MP trees of LFY, DDB2 and cpDNA using the program PADRE. Different colours of lines indicate the positions of the species in the cpDNA network (lineages I-III in Fig. 2 ) and the alleles in the two nuclear gene phylogenies (clades A-C in Fig. 5) : green, lineage I, clade A; blue, lineage II, clade C; purple, lineage III, clade C; red, clade B; grey, the lineage of cpDNA haplotype H11. Bold solid and dashed lines represent putative maternal and paternal progenitors of the tetraploids, respectively. Diploids and autotetraploids are in black, and allotetraploids are in colour. Letters following species names are population names corresponding to those in Table 1. As discussed above, the widespread diploids of E. equisetina-E. minuta-E. monosperma or their progenitors may have played important roles in allopolyploid speciation of Ephedra in the QTP and adjacent regions. Interestingly, most of the above six tetraploid taxa harbour two or more chlorotypes, even chlorotypes from different main lineages such as in E. saxatilis var. mairei (Figs 1 and 2) . This may indicate multiple origins of a tetraploid taxon, divergence of chlorotypes subsequent to polyploidy, or interspecific chloroplast introgression.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 158, "text": "(Fig. 5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 215, "end": 223, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 271, "end": 279, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 519, "end": 525, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 541, "end": 548, "text": "Fig. 5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 590, "end": 598, "text": "(Fig. 6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 784, "end": 798, "text": "(Figs 1 and 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1041, "text": "(Figs 5 and 6)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1199, "text": "(Figs 1 and 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1434, "text": "(Figs 5 and  6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1444, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1691, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1768, "text": "Fig. 5)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2183, "end": 2191, "text": "Table 1.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2570, "end": 2584, "text": "(Figs 1 and 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A high frequency of allopolyploid speciation in Ephedra in the QTP and its vicinities"}, {"text": "Both diploid and tetraploid cytotypes are present in E. gerardiana, E. przewalskii and E. regeliana (Table 1) . The tetraploids of E. przewalskii only have A2-type sequences of the nuclear gene LFY (in clade A, Fig. 5 ) as its diploids (Figs 3 and 4) , but do not share all chlorotypes with the diploids (Table 1; Fig. 1 ), although their chlorotypes all belong to lineage I (Fig. 2) . In particular, the chlorotype H3 is shared between the tetraploids of E. przewalskii and E. glauca (Table 1; Fig. 1 ). Therefore, the tetraploids of E. przewalskii may be autopolyploids or young allopolyploids with very closely related parental species. In the LFY tree (Fig. 5) , the tetraploids of E. regeliana harbour two subtypes of sequences in clade A, including A2 with the diploids and tetraploids of E. przewalskii and the tetraploid E. glauca, and A3 with the diploid E. regeliana and two tetraploid species (E. sinica and E. intermedia). Notably, the diploids and tetraploids of E. regeliana do not share chlorotypes (Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). Thus, the tetraploids of E. regeliana could be allopolyploids that might have originated by hybridization between the diploids of E. regeliana and E. przewalskii (Fig. 6) , although an origin by hybridization between an autotetraploid of E. regeliana and a tetraploid of other species cannot be ruled out. In addition, there could be incomplete linage sorting or introgression at the tetraploid level. However, it is unknown why this tetraploid population (XAB) only exhibits private chlorotypes. The diploids and tetraploids of E. gerardiana occur in clade C and clade B+ clade C, respectively (Fig. 5) , and they do not share chlorotypes (Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). This may also suggest an allopolyploid origin or a complicated origin of the tetraploid cytotype like in the tetraploid E. regeliana (Fig. 6) , although the two cytotypes of E. gerardiana do not show clear morphological difference.

Of the 36 Ephedra species that have been cytologically studied, 24 are polyploids or contain polyploid cytotypes (66% of species). Although intraspecific polyploidy has been documented in about half of the species, the results of some early cytological studies need to be checked carefully as mentioned earlier, and more population samples are necessary to study the ploidy levels of a species. Notably, all polyploids in the 24 species are tetraploids with the exception of an octoploid cytotype reported in E. funerea and E. gerardiana (Table S3 , Supporting information). According to the available information (Table S3 , Supporting information), tetraploids are present in about 75% of the Old World species and 62.5% of the New World species. Our present study found that all tetraploid Ephedra species from the QTP and neighbouring areas, excluding the species with both diploid and tetraploid populations, are allotetraploids. Therefore, we may conclude that allotetraploidy is a dominant mode of speciation in Ephedra, although the origin of other polyploids in this genus, especially from Europe and America, needs to be further studied.

The high percentage of polyploids in Ephedra could be related to some attributes of the genus such as a shrub habit, vegetative propagation, a relatively high rate of unreduced gamete formation, and a relatively low basic chromosome number and small genome size (at diploid level) for a gymnosperm (Leitch & Leitch 2012 Grif (2000) reported that plant taxa with a small DNA value per genome have a high percentage of polyploidy and show higher ploidy levels, and Wood et al. (2009) found that the generic base count (the minimum number of chromosomes reported in a genus) is negatively associated with polyploid incidence in angiosperms. In particular, the union of unreduced gametes has been considered as the most likely way of polyploid formation in plants (Harlan & de Wet 1975; de Wet 1980; Soltis et al. 2010; Brownfield & K\u20ac ohler 2011) , and the different rates of unreduced (Bretagnolle & Thompson 1996; Ramsey & Schemske 1998 , 2002 Ramsey 2006; Younis et al. 2014) . According to the karyomorphological study of Ephedra based on pollen germination, three of five tetraploid species exhibited unreduced pollen grains that accounted for 2-5% of the total amount (Mehra 1946) . Also, dimorphism of pollen size in the same herbarium specimen has been reported from seven species of Ephedra, including E. alata, E. americana, E. aphylla, E. breana, E. chilensis, E. ochreata, E. torreyana, E. trifurca and E. tweediana (Beug 1956; Kedves 1987; Ickert-Bond et al. 2003) .
