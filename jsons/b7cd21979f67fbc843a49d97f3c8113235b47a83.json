It is diffi cult to diagnose FIP, since the viruses cannot be distinguished using serological or virological methods. Recently, genetic techniques, such as RT-PCR, have been conducted for FIP diagnosis.

FCoV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and usually causes a mild to inapparent enteritis [ 2 ] . FIP is considered to be induced by a virulent mutant (FIP virus; FIPV) of this enteric FCoV (feline enteric coronavirus; FECV) [ 2 , 3 ] .

When using CSF, RNA detection can also give a highly specifi c diagnosis. However, the absence of FIP cannot be generally concluded based on negative results, because small amounts of the virus may exist in CSF from FIP cases [ 1 , 20 , 21 ] . Even in non-FIP and healthy carriers, RNA may be detected in blood for several months after FECV infection [ 22 , 23 ] . Of note, associated RNA is frequently detected in blood from FCoV-endemic multi-cat households. Thus, the reliability of RT-PCR -positive results obtained from a blood specimen is dependent on the rearing environment [ 23 -25 ] . In contrast, FIP may be excluded when a blood specimen is RT-PCR negative, because the RNA detection sensitivity is relatively high with blood from FIP cases [ 17 , 23 , 26 , 27 ] . RNA detection sensitivity varies among tissues, i.e., higher in the liver and spleen, and lower in the kidneys and heart [ 28 -30 ] .
