            "text": "The first cases of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were described in the early 1980s. Later, in 1984,4 HIV-1 was determined to be the causative agent, and HIV-1 infection was recognized as a spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic infection to full-blown AIDS. The AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 2 million lives in 2007, and an estimated 2.7 million people acquired HIV-1 in 2007. An estimated 33 million people globally are living with the virus.5 With the successful preventive strategies of elective cesarean section delivery and chemoprophylaxis of pregnant HIV-1-infected women, the transmission rates plummeted from 15 to 30% to less than 1 to 2% of all HIV-1-infected women delivering infants.6 The advent of HAART in 1996 changed the natural history of HIV-1 in children in many countries.7 However, the successes of prevention and prophylaxis have not been realized as much in developing countries, where HIV infection continues to increase. For this reason, there are disparate accounts of opportunistic infections and other diseases in regions with high HAART accessibility and those with limited HAART accessibility.8\n",

It has a particular tropism for the CD4 surface antigen of cells, and the binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor initiates the viral cycle. The virus may subsequently replicate within the host cell or, alternatively, the proviral DNA within the host cells may remain latent until cellular activation occurs. Human T lymphocytes and monocytes-macrophages are the primary cells that are infected with HIV-1, although other cell lines may be infected as well. The net effect is suppression of the immune system and a progressive decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes, which leaves patients susceptible to opportunistic and recurrent bacterial infections.",

In vertical transmission, HIV-1 is found in the gastrointestinal tract after the fetus swallows infected amniotic fluid, blood, cervical secretions, or breast milk. The virus, inoculated in the gastrointestinal tract, infects the fetus as it enters into the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) through the tonsil or upper intestinal tract. Examination of both acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV infection have documented reduced CD4 cell levels in GALT prior to a detectable reduction in T cells of the peripheral blood, highlighting the gastrointestinal tract\u2019s role and susceptibility.9., 10., 11., 12. The rates of acquisition of HIV-1 through the gastrointestinal tract are likely related to the quantity of virus in the person transmitting it13., 14., 15. and the immunologic function and maturity of the patient being infected. Mucosal infections with opportunistic infections may increase HIV-1 transmission. Mycobacterial infections up-regulate CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) expression in monocytes, which facilitates the entry of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Other factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which is induced by nuclear factor (NF)-\u043aB (which itself is pathogen induced), are potent inducers of HIV-1.16., 17.\n",

            "text": "Once transmitted, the lamina propria lymphocytes express CCR5 and CXC4 chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), which support HIV-1 replication.25., 26. Early after infection, there is a greater proportion of infected lymphocytes in the lamina propria than in peripheral blood.27., 28. For the patients actively receiving HAART, Poles et al.29 described \u201ccryptic replication\u201d occurring in GALT reservoirs in which viral replication is actively taking place at slower rates but HIV-1 RNA levels remain undetected in peripheral blood. Further, GALT contained more than twice as many lymphoid cells (160,000) than peripheral blood mononuclear cells (70,000) possessing HIV-1 DNA with viral replication capacity. There was no significant reduction in these values when the analysis was repeated after 12 months. Lymphocytes are able to disseminate the virus to distant sites, with depletion of CD4 cells in the lamina propria27., 30. and then in the blood. Even with aggressive suppression of HIV-1 during the primary stages by highly active antiretroviral agents, CD4 cell depletion is observed in the effector subcompartment gut mucosa when CD4 levels in the peripheral blood have stabilized.10 As mucosal and peripheral T cells are depleted, monocytes and macrophages become important reservoirs for the virus. The intestinal macrophages do not promote inflammation and do not carry the receptor for CCR5 or CXCR4; however, the blood monocytes are different in their profile and are infected by HIV-1. They are found infected in the blood and thereafter take up residence in the gut.31 They are stimulated by opportunistic agents and proinflammatory cytokines.32 Recent in vitro studies have implicated the integrin receptor \u03b14\u03b27 on which the HIV-1 envelope binds and transmits signals mediated by an epitope in the V2loop of gp120. This in turn activates LFA-1 and is pivotal in virological synapse formation, allowing rapid cellular dissemination of HIV-1.33\n",

These symptoms include weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, and malabsorption (Table 42-1\n). The advent of antiretroviral treatment induces debilitating effects on mechanisms within the gut that promote chronic HIV infection. Mainly, high levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are associated with marked systemic immune activation sustaining this infection; antiretroviral therapy decreases levels of LPS, promotes CD4+ T cell reconstitution, and may subsequently decrease the systemic immune activation.36 Additional studies examining this relationship stand to offer greater insight into HIV pathogenesis.",

Previous studies have shown that activated mucosal T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of enteropathy in the human small intestine37 and can affect the morphology of the villi and crypts in a manner similar to that seen in patients with HIV-1 infection. The magnitude of viral burden in the gastrointestinal tract is associated with villous blunting and other abnormal morphology.34 A number of studies in the 1980s associated a distinct enteropathy with HIV-1.38 Diarrhea, weight loss, an abnormally low d-xylose absorption, and steatorrhea, without evidence of intestinal infection, were common findings. Jejunal biopsies showed partial villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia and increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. This was the first histologic description of a specific pathologic process that occurred in the lamina propria of the small intestine in some patients with HIV-1. Others39 found low-grade small bowel atrophy and maturational defects of enterocytes, supporting an HIV-1 enteropathy characterized by mucosal atrophy with hyporegeneration. However, some investigators have challenged this concept, suggesting that the findings could be attributed to an undiagnosed enteric infection. Recently, genotype profiling for genes responsible for endothelial barrier maintenance and metabolic functioning has shown a decreased expression in the presence of increased viral replication in the GALT and reduced CD4+ T cell levels.40 These findings are significant, because they offer an additional modality for evaluating microenvironmental alterations within the gastrointestinal tract of the patient. Additional studies will help to determine the efficacy of gene expression profiling in HIV-infected individuals.",

HIV-1-infected patients who were minimally symptomatic had normal intestinal absorption and permeability, yet had greater gastrointestinal dysfunction as they progressed to AIDS. Malabsorption of bile acids and vitamin B12 did not correlate with morphometric analysis of ileal biopsies and was unremarkable in these patients. Thus, there was significant mucosal dysfunction with only minor ileal morphologic changes. Malabsorption of bile acids may play a pathologic role in patients with AIDS diarrhea. The absorptive defect of AIDS enteropathy using a d-xylose kinetic model of proximal absorption was studied43 and correlated with the results of a Schilling test for cobalamin absorption, which measures distal intestinal function. There were minimal histologic abnormalities in both the proximal and distal biopsy sites in patients with diarrhea and no enteric infection. d-Xylose absorption was low, and the absorptive defect was more severe and greater than would be expected from the histologic abnormalities found. Thus, these findings support the theory that there is little association between histologic characteristics of the small bowel and its absorptive function in patients with HIV-1 infection.",

In addition, Keating et al.44 described absorptive capacity and intestinal permeability in HIV-1-infected patients. Malabsorption was prevalent in all groups of patients with AIDS, but was not as common in the asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients. Malabsorption correlated with the degree of immune suppression and with body mass index. There were mild decreases in the ratio of jejunal villous height to crypt depth, yet not as severe as the subtotal villous atrophy found in celiac disease. Lim et al.45 found disaccharidase activity decreased proportionately with greater HIV-1 disease severity, although there was no association between disaccharidase levels and weight loss. In addition, Mosavi et al.46 found no correlation between diarrhea and weight loss in HIV-1-positive patients. Taylor et al.47 found mild histologic changes accompanied by severe disaccharidase abnormalities; however, symptoms were severe enough to withdraw lactose in only 25% of the patients.

Sentongo et al.51 evaluated fat malabsorption and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency using fecal elastase-1 enzyme assay in 44 HIV-1-infected children. Hormone-stimulated pancreatic function testing and 72-hour stool and dietary fat sample collection were performed in children with abnormal fecal elastase levels. The prevalence of steatorrhea was 39% and that of pancreatic insufficiency was 0% (95% confidence interval 0 to 9%). There were no associations between steatorrhea and pancreatic insufficiency, growth, HIV-1 RNA viral load, CD4 status, or type of antiretroviral therapy.

The depletion of the CD4 T lymphocytes in the intestinal tract may cause change in the cytokine environment and alter intestinal function. Viral load in the intestinal tract may be considerably higher than that measured peripherally, and this can also affect mucosal gastrointestinal structure and function. Recently, the HIV-1 Tat protein was found to decrease glucose absorption through decreasing the activity of the sodium d-glucose symporter.54 Studies suggesting these hypotheses include that of Kotler et al.,55 which looked at intestinal mucosal inflammation in 74 HIV-1-infected individuals. These authors found abnormal histopathology in 69% of the patients, and this finding was associated with altered bowel habits. High tissue P24 antigen levels were observed, and these correlated with more advanced HIV-1 disease. Tissue P24 detection was associated with both abnormal bowel habits and mucosal histology. The tissue content of cytokines, including TNF, \u03b1-interferon, and interleukin-1\u03b2, was higher in HIV-1-infected individuals than in controls, and these increases were independent of intestinal infection. Thus, HIV-1 reactivation in the intestinal mucosa could be associated with an inflammatory bowel-like syndrome in the absence of other enteric pathogens.",

For this reason, we have divided this section into two subsections: gastrointestinal infections in regions with low HAART accessibility or in patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells/mm3, and gastrointestinal infections in regions with high HAART accessibility and successful viral suppression. This does not imply that any of the infections discussed here occur in isolation contingent on HAART accessibility, because all HIV-1 patients regardless of HAART may encounter these complications. In the post-HAART era, it is helpful for a physician to know which backdrop lends itself to specific vulnerabilities.",

Diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopy and biopsy. The histologic appearance of CMV-infected cells is unique (Figure 42-1\n). These cells are enlarged and contain intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The nuclear inclusion bodies are acidophilic and are often surrounded by a halo. Cytoplasm inclusion bodies are multiple, granular, and often basophilic. Cells that are dying may appear smaller and smudged, with poorly defined inclusion bodies. Staining for CMV antigen shows that many of the infected cells are endothelial cells with others being perivascular mesenchymal cells. CMV can cause vasculitis because of its target cell population. Thus, the spread of CMV occurs with circulating infected endothelial cells. Treatment options are outlined in Table 42-2.

Similar findings were documented by Kotler et al.,80 who showed adherent bacteria in 17% of all adult patients with AIDS. The infection was localized primarily to the cecum and right colon, and three distinct histopathologic patterns of adherence were observed: attachment on effacing lesions, bacteria intercalated between microvilli, and aggregates of bacteria more loosely attached to the damaged epithelium.

The small intestine is the primary target, although it can occur in any part of the intestinal tract. Esophageal cryptosporidiosis has also been described in one child100 and in adults.

One was accompanied by severe clinical disease with significant malabsorption, with the majority of the organisms found in the proximal small bowel, whereas less severe clinical disease was seen in patients with colonic disease or with infection noted only in the stool. Patients with proximal small bowel infection with Cryptosporidium showed crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy, lamina propria inflammatory infiltrates, abnormal d-xylose absorption, greater weight loss, and shorter survival, with greater need for intravenous hydration and hyperalimentation than patients with colonic disease. In other studies, absorption of nutrients showed an inverse correlation with active infection,102 as shown by altered vitamin B12 and d-xylose absorption and lactulose and mannitol urinary excretion ratios.

Several different agents are used to eradicate the organism, with varying success rates. The most effective treatment is to improve immunologic function and nutritional status. With the advent of HAART, many children\u2019s immune function has been restored with a lower incidence and prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection.106 The introduction of HAART in a patient with severe debilitating Cryptosporidium infection not only resulted in an increased CD4 count in the peripheral blood and clearance of the organism, but also produced a marked increase in CD4 count in the rectal mucosa on biopsy, suggesting this may have been the main mechanism of clearing the parasite.107 Octreotide therapy of acute and chronic diarrhea, with coincident improvement in nutritional status, eradicated Cryptosporidium in one patient.105., 108. Other investigators have used bovine hyperimmune colostrum with benefit.109., 110. The macrolides, such as azithromycin, have shown some promise in the treatment of Cryptosporidium infection.111., 112. The effect of protease inhibitors as therapy against Cryptosporidium has been tested in a cell culture system.113 Nelfinavir moderately inhibited the host cell invasion over a period of 2 hours. Indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir inhibited parasite development significantly. The inhibitory effect was increased when the aminoglycoside paromomycin was combined with the protease inhibitors indinavir, ritonavir and, to a lesser extent, saquinavir, compared with the protease inhibitor alone. Thus, protease inhibitor therapy may directly (rather than indirectly, through its effects on the immune system) inhibit growth of Cryptosporidium. Amadi et al.92 found that a 3-day course of nitazoxanide improved diarrhea, helped eradicate the parasite, and improved mortality in HIV-1-seronegative, but not HIV-1-seropositive, children in Zambia. Treatment with nitazoxanide on immunocompetent patients demonstrated parasitic load reduction, but its effects on immunocompromised patients are not yet palpable.114\n",

These organisms were first described in 1857, when recognized as a cause of disease in nonhuman hosts.115 The first description of microsporidia (Enterocytozoon bieneusi) as a human pathogen was in 1985, and microsporidia have since been described as more common human pathogens.116 Infection with microsporidia typically occurs in patients with severely depressed CD4 T-lymphocyte counts. One of the largest case studies of intestinal microsporidiosis in patients with HIV-1 infection was described by Orenstein et al.117 in 67 adult patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex and chronic nonpathogenic diarrhea. E. bieneusi was diagnosed by electron microscopy in 20 of the patients. Jejunal biopsies were more positive than duodenal biopsies. The parasites and spores were clearly visible by light microscopy in 17 of the 21 biopsies. Infection was confined to enterocytes located at the tip of the intestinal villus, and the histologic findings included villous atrophy, cell degeneration, necrosis, and sloughing. Other investigators118., 119., 120. found microsporidia in as many as 50% of HIV-1-infected patients with chronic and unexplained diarrhea evaluated in the pre-HAART era. E. bieneusi has been documented in 15 to 25% of children with121 or without122 diarrhea in developing countries, making it fairly ubiquitous in these regions of the world. Other species of microsporidia, including Encephalitozoon (Septata) intestinalis, can cause significant enteric disease with diarrhea, wasting and malabsorption. Encephalitozoon intestinalis differs from Enterocytozoon bieneusi in its tendency to disseminate, and it can infect enterocytes as well as macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.",

The esophagus is the primary target of Candida, and this infection occurred in the majority of patients during the course of their illness in the pre-HAART era. It was also the second most frequent AIDS-defining disease, second in prevalence only to Pneumocystis jirovecii. Patients with Candida esophagitis complain of odynophagia or dysphagia and may often have vomiting and recurrent abdominal pain. Children often have oral thrush, coincident with more disseminated and invasive Candida esophagitis, although the absence of oral thrush does not preclude the diagnosis of Candida esophagitis.41 In one study, oral candidiasis preceded the diagnosis of Candida esophagitis in 94% of children.133 Other risk factors include low CD4 count and prior antibiotic use.133 Histopathologically, yeast forms within an intact mucosa confirm invasive disease. This is in contrast to colonization, where the yeast is found overlying intact mucosal surfaces or necrotic tissue. These organisms are best seen with Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver method or periodic acid-Schiff stain. Upper gastrointestinal studies are suggestive of Candida esophagitis with diffuse mucosal irregularities (Figure 42-4\n). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy and appropriate staining is the most sensitive test for determining invasive candidiasis of the esophagus. Candidiasis can also occur in the stomach, as well as the small bowel if the acid barrier has been suppressed either through an intrinsic decrease in gastric acid production or iatrogenically with the use of potent acid blockers. Numerous effective therapies have been described to treat Candida of the upper gastrointestinal tract, including fluconazole, ketoconazole, and itraconazole.134., 135. Ketoconazole has more hepatic side effects than fluconazole. Itraconazole is usually well tolerated and is effective. In severe and invasive disease, either topical or intravenous amphotericin can be used. Agents such as oral miconazole and nystatin are not indicated for invasive Candida.",

Thus, even with HAART, diarrhea is prevalent and is often associated with identifiable pathogens. C. difficile infection has been reported to be one of the most common bacterial diarrheal pathogens among HIV-infected patients although its rates have decreased with HAART.146 Because of the serious complications that are associated with active bacterial enteric infections in immunodeficient children, treatment options are outlined in Table 42-2.",

In 70% of patients in this series, the clinical management of the child was changed because of the endoscopic evaluation. A high diagnostic yield has been supported by other investigators.166 Specific gastrointestinal symptoms are not predictive of abnormal findings at endoscopy; advanced HIV-1 disease stage and an increased number of symptoms seem to be more predictive.41 Histologic studies of the small bowel may aid in determining the degree of the villous blunting, and electron microscopy and special staining for opportunistic pathogens can be performed. Quantitative bacterial cultures and parasite evaluation of the duodenal fluid should be obtained when an endoscopy is performed. Characteristically, the detection of more than 105 organisms per milliliter of duodenal fluid confirms bacterial overgrowth. It is important to obtain both anaerobic and quantitative cultures. However, other studies have shown that endoscopy does not improve the diagnostic yield compared with stool examination in patients with intestinal infection. The only exception is the diagnosis of CMV.167 An additional study found that flexible sigmoidoscopy was as useful as a full colonoscopy for diagnosing infection.168 Special histologic stains for fungal, mycobacterial, or viral infections did not increase the diagnostic yield over routine hematoxylin and eosin staining.169\n",

There should be careful consideration of calcium and vitamin D intake, because children with HIV-1 infection are susceptible to low bone mineral density.170., 171., 172. If there is malabsorption of protein and fat, a protein hydrolysate diet should be tried. Many of these supplements are poorly tolerated because they are unpalatable. In some circumstances, specialized supplements may need to be administered through a supplemental feeding tube.173., 174.

In malnourished children there is a profound involution of lymphoid tissues, including thymic atrophy and diminished paracortical regions of lymph nodes.177 In young infants and children, protein-calorie malnutrition increases the risk of death by severalfold by increasing the susceptibility to infection.178 In many countries, the mortality rate increases from 0.5% in children whose weight-for-height percentage of standard is greater than 80%, to 18% in children whose weight-for-height percentage of standard is less than 60%.179 In other diseases such as cystic fibrosis and cancer, nutritional status has been linked closely to survival and morbidity.

Not only does nutrition improve the immunologic functioning of the intestinal tract, but nutrients themselves are trophic and essential for the maintenance of the absorptive capacity of the intestines. In some studies, weight loss greater than 30%, due to other disorders, is associated with a reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion of over 80%, villous atrophy, and impaired carbohydrate and fat absorption.180 These disorders are promptly reversed with appropriate nutritional rehabilitation. With villous blunting, antigen uptake can increase, leaving the child at higher risk of enteric infection. The pathogenesis of villous blunting is unclear but may be due to crypt hyperplasia as the primary event with premature sloughing at the villus tip181 versus loss of enterocytes at the villus tip with resultant proliferation at the crypts.182\n",

In 2006, coinfection rates of hepatitis B were reported to be between 5 and 10% in the global HIV population. Prolonged hepatitis B infection is one of the greatest concerns of for coinfected patients.193 Hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg) is the protein associated with active hepatitis B in patients and is used by clinicians to determine efficacy of medications. For monoinfected hepatitis B patients, proper treatment can result in significant reduction of HBeAg in 90 to 95% of patients; however, this success is not mirrored in HIV-coinfected populations.194 There is also evidence for greater reactivation and replication in hepatitis B-HIV coinfected patients.193., 195., 196., 197. Explanation for this focuses on HIV patients\u2019 increased proinflammatory cytokine production and their inability to eliminate hepatocytes infected with hepatitis B.196., 198. Balancing dual treatment for both hepatitis B and HIV viruses presents a unique challenge for clinicians. Acquired mutations of hepatitis B render additional treatment considerations, deepening the challenge. Resistant hepatitis B strains have been identified, many of them falling under the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate category, YMDD. Iacomi et al.199 determined that 28 of 29 hepatitis B\u2013HIV coinfected patients exhibited this specified resistance. Lamivudine, once commonly prescribed, has become less effective because of developed resistance. Of the various treatment options, only tenofovir is used in HIV treatment and is effective in both the wild-type hepatitis B virus and the resistant YMDD strain, and it is often concomitantly administered with emtricitabine.200., 201.\n",

Liver disease in coinfected patients may be accelerated when compared to their monoinfected counterparts. Pathways that have been proposed to accelerate fibrosis in coinfected patients include direct viral effects, dysregulation of the immune system toward a profibrotic state, and other metabolic pathways that lead to liver toxicity and processes such as steatosis and insulin resistance.204 Giovaninni et al.203 studied 49 HIV-infected children, 11 of whom were coinfected with hepatitis C. Six of the coinfected patients had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Three of the six children had AIDS, and three had AIDS-related complex. Five children with normal aminotransferase had no detectable viral progression. Following acute hepatitis C infection, hepatitis C\u2013HIV coinfected patients are over 20% more likely than monoinfected patients to develop chronic hepatitis C infection.205., 206., 207. Interferon with ribavirin therapy is widespread in chronic hepatitis-C monoinfected patients, and its efficacy in hepatitis C\u2013HIV coinfected patients is yet to be fully realized.208., 209. When compared to conventional interferon therapy (IFN\u03b1-2a), 180 \u03bcg/week pegylated interferon (pegIFN\u03b1-2a) plus 800 mg/day ribavirin demonstrated enhanced histological effects that were also associated with improved virological response in hepatitis C\u2013HIV coinfected patients.210 End-stage liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma have been observed with greater frequency in hepatitis C\u2013HIV coinfected patients.205 These findings reflect adult populations and may or may not be indicative of outcomes in pediatric patients.",

Despite a disproportionate increase in alkaline phosphatase levels, ALT levels may or may not be elevated. An ultrasound of the biliary system may be needed when serum sampling is equivocal. Biliary tract disease is often obstructive; thus, use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) will help to identify the obstruction, perhaps provide bile sampling, and even mitigate the obstruction via sphincterotomy. Bile sampling may indicate the presence of CMV, Cryptosporidium, Mycobacterium, or microsporidia, which were all discussed in previous sections. In one study employing sonography, 26 of 41 HIV-infected children displayed hepatobiliary abnormalities, yet there was no evidence of infection.211 AIDS cholangiopathy is defined by intra- and extrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis and is commonly linked to CMV and Cryptosporidium infections.
