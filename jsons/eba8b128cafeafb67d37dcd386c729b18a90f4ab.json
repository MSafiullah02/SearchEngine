With the present COVID-19, such a severity is not obvious but the inflammatory response is also intense. In these patients, interpretation of the coagulation changes may even be more challenging as they are superimposed on the physiological changes induced by pregnancy. In normal pregnancy, fibrinogen concentration and D-Dimers values are increased, the platelet count often falls, both activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time shorten due to the important rise of the plasma concentration of most coagulation factors. In COVID-19 illness, additional coagulation changes may occur. Their intensity might be related to the disease severity but complete data are still lacking. An increase in D-Dimers concentration is observed, as well as a lengthening of both APTT and PT, the later leading to an increase in international normalised ratio (INR) values. Because these changes are superimposed on the physiological increase in coagulation factors, test results may not appear too abnormally low (i.e. falsely high as compared to non-pregnant values). Interestingly, the platelet count often remains minimally modified but in some cases, significant thrombocytopenia may occur ( [3] .",

In the rare cases in which circulating anticoagulant antibodies have been looked for, they were not found in the plasma of these pregnant women. In a recent report of three non-pregnant patients in whom severe COVID-19 illness had occurred, a major coagulopathic state was observed with thrombocytopenia, lengthened TT and highly increased D-Dimers concentrations [11] . The three patients had multiple cerebral infarctions and antiphospholipid antibodies were detected.",

            "text": "Hypercoagulability may pose a threat by increasing the thromboembolic risk. This risk may occur either during or after pregnancy depending on the time at which the infection has started. Pregnancy is by itself a situation at increased thromboembolic risk and the postpartum period increases even more this risk. Due to the coagulation changes induced by the viral infection, the risk may be increased to a greater extent. This is suggested by data obtained in non-pregnant patients with a severe disease in whom thromboembolic complications have been reported. In non-pregnant contexts also, anticoagulation (mainly low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) have been administered, sometimes in very high, non-prophylactic doses [16] . In pregnant women however, no firm data exist and in most patients the viral insult is of limited severity, possibly explaining why thromboembolic complications may not be as injurious as suggested by the major biological changes. Administration of LMWH is however suggested by several scientific bodies, mostly using prophylactic doses [17] [18] [19] . The precise indications are still unclear but it seems wise to analyse the overall thromboembolic risk of a given patient, including traditional non-viral related risk factors and multiplying by the risk factor associated with infection [20] . During pregnancy (Appendix 2), French experts suggest administering LMWH to COVID-19 infected women with at least a moderate or severe thrombotic risk during the time period where clinical symptoms are present (and/or oxygen is required). Although it might be useful to prolong treatment as recovery may not be easily defined, the experts suggest reducing the duration of treatment due to the complicated management of labour and neuraxial block placement, should delivery occur during the period of LMWH administration. In postpartum patients with recent COVID-19 infection, the haemorrhagic risk associated with LMWH is thought to be lower than the thromboembolic risk, if one accepts that a strong correlation exists between the impressive biological disturbances. Although the risk of thromboembolism is lower after vaginal delivery, it seems wise to administer LMWH in this situation when personal risk factors are added to the risk associated with viral infection. After caesarean section, this seems even more logical and there may be few patients in who LMWH may not be required. The optimal duration of anticoagulant treatment is unknown but should probably be adapted to the disease severity.",
