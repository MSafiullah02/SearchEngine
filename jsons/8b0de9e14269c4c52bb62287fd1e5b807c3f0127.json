In general, asthma improves toward the end of the pregnancy, including labor and delivery. However, the rate of asthma exacerbations is increased between gestational weeks 17 and 32 [ 1 , 2 ] . This may in part be due to medication noncompliance during the earlier part of the pregnancy upon discovery of the pregnancy but may also have to do with other pregnancy-related factors such as esophageal refl ux, nasal congestion, hormonal factors, and alterations in immunity that may result in increased susceptibility to infections. The major predictor of disease course is the severity of asthma prior to the pregnancy, but race and obesity may also play a role. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have asthma exacerbations. Poor compliance with medications and diffi culties with access to medical services may be important confounders. Additionally, obese women tend to have more severe asthma as both asthma and obesity share a common infl ammatory pathway at the cellular level. Asthma also tends to behave in a similar fashion in subsequent pregnancies.",

In other large studies, a small, but statistically signifi cant risk of perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, and preterm deliveries have been reported [ 4 , 5 ] . A more recent retrospective cohort study performed in 12 clinical centers in the United States has shown increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and all preterm births [ 6 ] . Secondary analysis of a recent randomized controlled trial showed that women with perception of good asthma control had a reduced risk of planned cesarean deliveries, asthma exacerbations, and preterm birth [ 7 ] . In the same study, women with increased anxiety had a higher risk of exacerbations. There is some evidence suggesting that poorly controlled asthma also confers an increased risk of small for gestational age, and low birth weight [ 8 ] . Growth restriction may, however, be confounded by smoking. Babies born to severe asthmatics are possibly more likely to have congenital anomalies [ 5 ] .",

            "text": "There are four general components of asthma care, irrespective of gestational age. These are (1) monitoring of respiratory status, (2) avoidance of possible triggers, (3) patient education, and (4) pharmacological treatment. Patients should get a baseline spirometry and be instructed in how to follow their peak expiratory fl ow rate (PEFR) at home. Ideally, this should be done twice a day in patients with persistent disease. Since pregnancy does not affect fl ow rates, reductions in these numbers usually indicate a worsening degree of airfl ow obstruction and should prompt quick medical evaluation. Second, it is critical that patients avoid their known triggers to asthma including tobacco, dust, extreme temperatures, and allergens such as pollen and pet dander. Third, patients need to be educated about their disease. Pregnancy constitutes a perfect window to educate women given the multiple contacts with providers increased motivation due to concerns for fetal well-being. Trigger control from washing bed sheets to vacuuming to rodent control are important strategies to review, especially since in most circumstances, women are more likely to be exposed to these triggers. Important topics that need to be reviewed also include inhaler technique, early recognition of symptoms of worsening asthma, an action plan for acute asthma exacerbations, as well as an overview of how poorly controlled asthma can affect the pregnancy. Patients should also be provided with the opportunity to express their concerns and ask questions. In a multi-institutional prospective study, lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), but not asthma symptom frequency, was shown to be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes [ 9 ] . These data may be a refl ection of the effect of asthma severity or poor asthma control on perinatal outcomes and emphasize the possibility of discrepancies between symptom-based assessment and more objective measurement of lung function in pregnant women with asthma. Finally, women with asthma need to receive the appropriate pharmacological treatment to achieve disease control. Populationbased data do show that well-controlled asthmatics without exacerbations have better outcomes than women with exacerbations, but for obvious reasons, there are no randomized controlled trials evaluating this particular question. Although most clinical practices use symptom-based, guideline-directed assessments to decide on medication use, recent data from a randomized controlled trial suggest lower rates of exacerbation, improved quality of life, and reduced neonatal hospitalization when management decisions were based on measurements of exhaled nitric oxide in pregnancy [ 10 ] . It is likely that this improvement in outcomes is due to improved control, rather than the method of assessment itself. Table 11 .2 provides an overview of the asthma medications that are used in pregnancy. As in the nonpregnant population, the choice of pharmacological agent depends on disease severity. A frank discussion with the expectant mother and her partner should occur to encourage them to voice their concerns regarding asthma treatment in pregnancy. Most women are told to stop their inhalers at the time of pregnancy diagnosis because of FDA category listing. For that reason, a good amount of time should be spent on counseling about the use of asthma drugs in pregnancy. Explaining to women that asthma control is key to the health of the pregnancy and their baby is an important part of counseling and may have to be done repeatedly during the course of pregnancy. In general, most asthma medications are justifi able in pregnancy, and some have adequate safety data. As noted in Table 11 .2 , many of the drug choices are category C according to the FDA classifi cation; however, these drugs are used routinely in the care of pregnant women with asthma. In addition, although leukotriene inhibitors are listed as category B, safety data are less reassuring than other drugs classifi ed as category C. Omalizumab is classifi ed as category B by the FDA despite the fact that all of the initial trials have excluded pregnant women. These safety data are based on animal studies which are limited by the fact that teratogenicity may be species specifi c. In addition, although prednisone may be associated with a small risk of cleft palate when administered in early pregnancy, the benefi t of this drug in an acute exacerbation of asthma by far outweighs the small risk of malformation. Table 11 .3 reviews the classifi cation of asthma severity, which includes not only symptoms but also peak fl ow meter measurements.",

The most common of these disorders are allergic rhinitis, gastroesophageal refl ux disease (GERD), sleep apnea, and psychiatric illnesses. Allergic rhinitis occurs in 80-90 % of nonpregnant asthmatics and worsens asthma symptoms. Management of the allergic rhinitis with drugs such as steroidal nasal sprays often improves asthma symptoms. Women who are pregnant can also develop a different form of rhinitis, called rhinitis of pregnancy. This typically occurs in the latter part of pregnancy and resolves completely within 2 weeks after delivery. The prevalence of GERD among nonpregnant asthmatics varies between 30 and 90 %. In pregnant women with asthma, this number is likely higher given that GERD has been reported to be present in nearly 75 % of all pregnant women [ 11 ] . GERD can worsen bronchoconstriction via increased vagal tone, heightened bronchial reactivity, and microaspiration of gastric contents into the upper airway. Patients who have symptoms of GERD benefi t from treatment. Although proton pump inhibitors are not expected to increase the risk of congenital malformation in experimental animal studies and limited human pregnancy exposures, ranitidine constitutes a safer fi rst choice. Finally, asthma and psychiatric comorbidities may coexist. Stress and mental illness can worsen asthma in the pregnant women and may also complicate compliance.",

However, patients with more severe disease or those who suffered an exacerbation close to term would require a detailed plan. Stress dosing with steroids during labor can be considered in patients who have been on prolonged periods of systemic steroids during the pregnancy. Patients with active symptoms or more severe asthma may benefi t from regional anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia reduces minute volume and oxygen consumption and may help prevent hyperinfl ation in patients with active symptoms and reduce oxygen consumption. If general anesthesia is to be considered, then ketamine and halogenated anesthetics are preferred. It is safe to use oxytocin and prostaglandin E2. However, ergotamine and ergot derivatives, 15-methyl prostaglandin F2 alpha, morphine, and meperidine should be avoided in pregnant women with asthma as they may be associated with an increased risk of bronchospasm.

More detailed information can be found in National Heart Lung and Blood Institute guidelines on asthma and pregnancy published in 2004. The treatment is similar to nonpregnant women with a few key differences that need to be highlighted. The fi rst is to remember that during pregnancy, the normal PaCO 2 is lower than in the nonpregnant state. Therefore, a normal or high PaCO 2 heralds worsening respiratory failure and should be acted upon quickly. Second, hypoxia during asthma exacerbations can lead to fetal distress and decelerations. Therefore, immediate bronchodilators and supplemental oxygen should be administered. Finally, it should be noted that while the indications for airway intubation are the same in the pregnant asthmatic as the nonpregnant asthmatic, intubation during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, can be more diffi cult. This is due to increased airway edema, low FRC and oxygen reserve, and a more profound response to sedatives from decreased venous return. Hence, the most experienced member of the team should perform the intubation and be familiar with diffi cult airway management procedures. Airway intubation is discussed in more detail in the critical care Chap. 2 .",

Chest X-ray should be performed in patients suspected of having pneumonia and helps confi rm the diagnosis or show evidence of a complicated pneumonia such as lung abscess or pleural effusion. Computed tomography scan is unlikely to add value in the management of pneumonia, unless empyema is suspected.

Intubations in pregnancy have a higher failure rate than the general surgical population (see Chap. 2 on airway intubation ). Attempts to maintain CO 2 within an acceptable range may be challenging in the event of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the use of lung protective strategies. Low tidal volume ventilation strategy with a target tidal volume of 6 ml/kg is recommended for ARDS [ 23 ] . Though pregnant women were excluded in the acute respiratory distress network studies on lung protective strategies, low tidal volume ventilation should be attempted, initially with a higher respiratory rate to maintain ventilation given the survival benefi t observed in the nonpregnant population. However, higher tidal volumes may be required to correct acidosis that may compromise the fetus, in such instances attempts should still be made to keep the plateau pressure below 30 cm of water as barotrauma is thought to contribute signifi cantly to lung injury. PaCO 2 levels need to be watched closely, and given the 10 mmHg gradient between fetal and maternal, maternal PaCO 2 should be kept at 55 mmHg or lower. Use of bicarbonate to correct the PH has been suggested in the nonpregnant population though clinical studies to support this approach are limited. It is thought that the transfer of bicarbonate across the placenta is slow and may not be adequate to correct fetal acidosis. While the decision to admit patients to the ICU is complex and should be individualized, clinicians should have a lower threshold when evaluating pregnant mothers.",

An optimal drug would be one with maximal efficacy against the known pathogen and no risk to the fetus. However, such drugs are scarce, and in most circumstances, a drug with more benefi t than risk can be selected. Other than concern for fetal safety, preferred antibiotics are not different from those in nonpregnant women, but dosing should take into account increased hepatic and renal clearance and increased volume of distribution. There is a theoretical concern that aminoglycosides and vancomycin may be associated with hearing and kidney dysfunction in the offspring, but this possibility has not been confi rmed clinically. Penicillins, clindamycins, and most macrolides except clarithromycin have a good safety profi le.

Gestational diabetes has been associated with a fi vefold increase in the risk of type II diabetes at 5 years and a ninefold risk at 9 years [ 65 ] . Snoring, poor sleep, and OSA have all been associated with a higher risk of unplanned cesarean deliveries. This association may be harder to explain and may depend on the actual reason leading to unplanned cesarean delivery such as obstetric, fetal, or medical causes.",

There are no specifi c guidelines on therapy initiation in pregnancy yet for various reasons. As stated above, the natural history of the disorder around the perinatal period is not well known. Thus, it is possible that, with weight loss and reversal of pregnancy physiology, the disorder may resolve or at least improve in the postpartum period. In addition, there have been no trials to date that have shown that treatment of OSA in pregnancy would improve pregnancy or fetal outcomes. This reason likely contributes to the fact that the disorder remains underscreened and underdiagnosed [ 59 ] . Based on current data, weight loss is unlikely to be an option in pregnancy because of concern that it may affect the nutritional status of the mother and therefore fetal well-being. Alcohol and cigarette smoking avoidance is another therapeutic strategy in pregnancy that carries additional pregnancy-specifi c benefi ts. Outside of pregnancy, CPAP therapy has been shown to improve quality of life and daytime sleepiness with some data suggesting improvement in cardiovascular outcomes such as hypertension. It is likely that these effects of CPAP are also true in pregnancy. Observational studies have shown improvement in daytime fatigue and daytime somnolence in pregnant women with OSA treated with CPAP and re-titrated around midpregnancy [ 66 ] . In women with preeclampsia, small, randomized trials have shown that in-laboratory positive airway pressure therapy improves hemodynamics, uric acid, and cardiac output compared to untreated women [ 67 , 68 ] . Until future studies of CPAP therapy are available in pregnancy, indications for therapy are likely the same as in the nonpregnant population. We are awaiting trials evaluating the effect of PAP therapy on pregnancy-specifi c outcomes to be able to determine the \"urgency\" of starting PAP therapy in pregnancy. The type of PAP therapy that is most benefi cial in pregnancy is unknown. However, auto-titrating PAP therapy has the advantage of avoiding repeat re-titration of pressure requirements.",
