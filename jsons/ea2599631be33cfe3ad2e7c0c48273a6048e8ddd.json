The total number of NK and CD158b+ NK cells and the percentage of CD158b+ NK cells were significantly lower in patients with SARS than in those with M pneumoniae infection (P < .05 for all) and healthy subjects (P < .01, P < .01, P < .05, respectively); in 72 patients with severe SARS than in 149 with mild SARS (P < .05 for all); and in 174 cases of SARS with anti-SARS coronavirus-specific IgG and/or IgM antibodies than in 47 without antibodies (P < .05, P < .01, P < .01, respectively).

To explore whether the number of NK cells and the amount of their immunoglobulinlike receptor CD158b changed in the peripheral blood of patients with SARS, as well as their relationship to the severity of the disease and the diagnostic value of monitoring the number of NK cells, we examined the number of NK cells and the amount of CD158b in the peripheral blood in a cohort of 221 patients with SARS.
