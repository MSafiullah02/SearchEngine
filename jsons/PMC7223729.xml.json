            "text": "The burden of antimicrobial resistance is a daily challenge in clinical settings, especially in acute and intensive care units. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most clinically important antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (AMR-GNB), being a common cause of urinary tract and lower respiratory tract infections, i.e., ventilator-associated pneumonia (Rupp\u00e9 et al. 2015). It is also commonly found in burn infections (Coetzee et al. 2013). P. aeruginosa maintains chronic infection through the formation of biofilms, which causes a delay in burn wound healing, patient recovery, and it is also a causative agent of graft loss. (Coetzee et al. 2013; Gonzalez et al. 2016). Treating MDR Pseudomonas species infections is challenging, and alternatives to systemic administered antibiotics are needed. Silver impregnated dressings and topical chemotherapeutics, such as mafenide acetate 11.2% cream, are being clinically used in the treatment of superficial and deep burn wounds, with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) remaining the standard topical antimicrobial for burn infections (Adhya et al. 2015). However, following the excessive and uncontrolled use of silver in medical and non-medical applications, serious concerns have been raised regarding bacterial resistance to silver (Chopra 2007), and thus, there is a need to look for other silver combinations and metal mixtures that have the potential to be used as antimicrobials.",

After drying, the coupons were placed into the centres of the wells of 12-well culture plates containing 1 mL of an adjusted bacterial cell suspension (OD 1.0). The plate was sealed with parafilm and incubated for 1 week at 37 \u00b0C under static conditions. After incubation, the coupons were washed gently with 2 mL of sterile distilled water to eradicate any loose planktonic cells, and then air-dried at room temperature for 2 h. One millilitre of each tested compound (500 mg/L) was added into the respective well and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. For synergy testing of metal ions and graphene/graphene oxide, 500 \u00b5L of each compound were added. The tested compounds were disposed and the coupons were carefully washed with 1 mL of sterile distilled water to remove non-adherent cells. Adherent cells were stained with 0.03% crystal violet (Oxoid, UK) for 30 min, and then washed with sterile water and left to air-dry for 1 h. One millilitre of 33% glacial acetic acid (BDH, UK) was added to each well. After 30 min, the supernatant was removed and the absorbance was read at OD590. Wells incubated with TSB only served as controls and were used to assess the adhesion ability of the biofilm. The biofilm forming strength was evaluated by comparing the ODsample to the ODblank (containing sterile TSB only). The subsequent classification was applied, adapted from Xu et al. (2016): weak biofilm formation (ODb < ODs \u2264 2 ODb), moderate (ODb < ODs \u2264 4 ODb), and strong biofilm formation (4 ODb \u2264 ODs).",

Subsequently, 1.5 mL of the previously prepared XTT added to 300 \u00b5L of menadione solution (0.4 mM in acetone) to prepare the XTT-menadione solution. The bacterial biofilms were formed for 7 days on the stainless steel coupons as previously described in CVBA assay. On the 7th day, the bacterial supernatant was removed and coupons were washed thrice with distilled water. The tested compounds were added to the designated wells at 2 \u00d7 MIC and were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in static conditions. After washing the biofilms three times with PBS, the XTT-menadione solution (750 \u00b5L) were added to each well and incubated in the dark at 37 \u00b0C. After 3 h, the OD of the supernatant was read at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer. Blanks constituted of sterile medium with XTT/menadione solution and their values were directly deducted from the sample values to minimize background intervention. Cells untreated with the tested compounds and cells treated with 70% isopropyl alcohol were set as negative and positive controls, respectively.

            "text": "Graphene-based compounds have emerged recently as potential novel broad-spectrum antibacterial agents (Hu et al. 2010; Tu et al. 2013; Slate et al. 2018). Several studies have indicated that graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa with at least an 86\u201399.9% reduction in viability (Hu et al. 2010; Tu et al. 2013). However, this was inconsistent with our results where graphene showed only a moderate effect (MIC = 125 mg/L) and graphene oxide (MIC > 500 mg/L) showed no inhibitory effect against any of the isolates tested. On the other hand, Ruiz et al. have previously demonstrated that graphene oxide enhanced bacterial growth (Ruiz et al. 2011). However, the bactericidal effect of graphene-based composites remains poorly understood. This requires further investigation, especially since their effect on the structure and viability of bacterial cells has also been shown to be dependent on the sample preparation and concentration, time of exposure, and physico-chemical properties, as well as on the method of microbiological analysis (Akhavan and Ghaderi, 2010; Hu et al. 2010). It may be speculated that in this study, the negative antimicrobial results obtained with graphene oxide against the planktonic bacterial form may be due to the type of graphene oxide used. It has been demonstrated that highly purified graphene oxide was inert against planktonic forms of bacterial cells (Barbolina et al. 2016). Furthermore, Barbolina et al. (2016), assigned the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of graphene oxide found in previous studies to the contaminants (sulphur, nitrogen) that remained following the preparation of the graphene oxide rather than to the effects of the graphene oxide itself (Barbolina et al. 2016).",

This may indicate that the metals/graphene combinations resulted in complementary modes of action, which enhanced the total antimicrobial efficacy, although this needs further investigation. A possible hypothesis might be that the metal ions, being in solution, become evenly dispersed in the environment surrounding the pathogen with no specific laterality (McQuillan et al. 2012). Meanwhile, adsorption of graphene particles by the pathogen may induce cell wall depolarization making the bacterial cell more permeable to destruction, assisting the metal ions to enter inside the bacterial cell (Pal et al. 2007).",

While silver alone and graphene alone exhibited no effect against the planktonic forms of the isolates, when the silver\u2013graphene combination was tested, it reduced both the number of planktonic cells and the amount of biofilm formed. Graphene oxide showed reduced growth of the biofilms when combined to molybdenum, gold, platinum, or gallium. The assessment of the cell viability of the biofilms of both isolates post-treatment with silver, silver\u2013graphene, gold\u2013graphene oxide, and molybdenum\u2013graphene oxide showed a significant reduction in biomass.",

Furthermore, the resulting combinations (silver\u2013graphene, molybdenum\u2013graphene/graphene oxide, gold/graphene/graphene oxide, platinum/graphene/graphene oxide, and gallium/graphene/graphene oxide) were able to significantly reduce the biofilm formation of the AMR isolates. Overall, the silver\u2013graphene and molybdenum\u2013graphene showed an antimicrobial effect against both planktonic and biofilm forms of the bacteria irrespective of their antibiotic resistance profiles.
