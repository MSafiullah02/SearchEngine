An intriguing observation has been the near absence of children in initial disease reports, mild disease overall in child cases, no reported deaths in children aged <10 years of age and suggestions that minimally symptomatic children may facilitate disease transmission within communities.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Li et al. report three child cases of confirmed COVID\u201019 infection7; the report is notable for at least two reasons.",

This raises multiple questions such as: (i) whether the low frequency of confirmed COVID\u201019 infections in children reflects case detection bias due to attenuated disease severity in children; (ii) whether undiagnosed child infections contribute to community transmission; (iii) the biological basis for the attenuated disease severity, if this is indeed the case; and (iv) the role of existing co\u2010morbidity in children, given indications that \u2013 as well as older age \u2013 co\u2010morbidity is a major determinant of disease severity in adults.2, 8\n",

The imperative to \u2018do anything possible\u2019 will be felt by all paediatricians caring for children with COVID\u201019; however, the \u2018first do no harm\u2019 principle should certainly apply in all situations where the natural history of disease is poorly described or indicative of likely spontaneous recovery without any treatment. Clinicians should always balance potential risks and benefits to the individual patient with assiduous attention to infection control to protect other vulnerable patients within the health\u2010care environment and the public at large.",

Paediatricians around the world should endeavour to collect comprehensive clinical data and biological specimens including longitudinal sampling from cases wherever they occur in order to further our understanding of the clinical features, pathogenesis of disease and host response in children infected with COVID\u201019.",
