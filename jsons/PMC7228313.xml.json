As of March 24, 20,203, among 169 countries in the world, the total accumulative confirmed cases are 387,382, and the total number of death is 16,767 (Johns Hopkins University, 2020). This pandemic has been compared to the Second World War or the Great Depression in terms of its wide scope and broad impact.",

That is, the COVID\u201019 pandemic forces humans to social isolations in order to control the extremely infectious coronavirus. Currently, different countries have been using different methods of social isolations. These methods include: voluntary self\u2010isolation, mandatory quarantine, travel restrictions, stay\u2010at\u2010home order, shutdowns of restaurants, theaters, churches, sports venues, museums, and other social organizations, closures of schools and universities, working at home, limits or closures of transportations such as airplanes, trains, buses, and ships, closures of country borders, declaration of state of emergency, and lockdowns of entire cities, entire regions, and entire countries. Nowadays, social distancing has become the latest buzzword in the headlines of media covering the COVID\u201019 pandemic. One recent example is that the world\u2010renowned opera singer Pl\u00e1cido Domingo has tested positive for the coronavirus on March 22, 2020, and he is in self\u2010isolation at home (Chen & Lee, 2020). Another heartbreaking example is that a holocaust survivor Arie Even passed away on March 21, 2020 as the first coronavirus death case in Israel, but his family was unable to be with him during his final days to avoid getting the virus (Estrin, 2020).",

These public health measures typically include isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantining exposed persons, school closures, workplace closures, and avoiding crowding. Technically, the basic idea of social distancing is to reduce risks of person\u2010to\u2010person transmission by \u201cdelaying the epidemic peak, reducing the size of the epidemic peak, and spreading cases over a longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system\u201d (Fong et al., 2020, p. 1).",

That is, various types of human social interactions (e.g., shopping, banking, learning, meeting, and entertaining) are shifted from dominantly offline to dominantly online. In other words, the enforced social isolations in the physical world significantly increase humans' social interactions in the cyber world. This becomes a \u201cnew normal\u201d in our daily life.",

This worldwide movement might be the largest online education practice in the human history. The article published by Dr. Wei Bao in this issue documents such a case. In the business sector, online shopping has almost become the mainstream shopping behavior for people to buy foods, groceries, medicines, and many other products from online stores such as http://amozon.com or online services of regular stores such as Walmart. In the entertainment sector, many theaters (e.g., Metropolitan Opera) and museums (e.g., various national museums in China) have been offering a series of live stream online performances or virtual exhibitions. In the public health sector, specific mobile apps have been developed successfully for testing, tracing, analyzing, and social distancing in China, Singapore, Korea, UK, and other countries in the world. This week, Dr. Ashley Mason at UCSF is running an experimental study with over 2,000 San Francisco emergency medical workers, by asking them to wear the Oura Rings, a wearable device to monitors body temperature, breathing, heart rate, and other physical indicators, in order to track their body temperature in the real time and identify the early onset of COVID\u201019 (Gafni, 2020).",

Diffusion is the key concept of American sociologist Everett Rogers' well\u2010known theory of diffusion of innovations (Rogers, 2010). Roger defined diffusion as a process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of certain social systems. Based on this theory, different innovations may have different S\u2010shaped diffusion curves; different community members can be categorized into five types, innovators, early adopter, early majority, later majority, and laggards.",

In contrary, we are also observing various cases that reduce or limit diffusion of emerging digital technologies. For example, cybersecurity and privacy concerns have been increasing more than ever, while countries began tracking those possibly exposed to the coronavirus. Individuals and organizations are suffering more from misinformation that has been spreading widely and quickly through online videos, social media, or personal emails.",

While researchers started to publish studies on using emerging technologies to tackle the pandemic (e.g., Pandey, Gautam, Bhagat, & Sethi, 2020; Wang, Ng, & Brook, 2020), much more timely efforts should be made to conduct behavioral studies on how technologies can be used to guide people's behavior. One excellent example of behavioral research is a recent research report titled Using behavioural science to help fight the coronavirus (Lunn et al., 2020). In this report released on March 12, 2020, Pete Lunn and his collaborators in Ireland spent 1 week and reviewed the existing behavioral science literature on seven topics: hand washing, face touching, entering and coping with isolation, encouraging collective action, avoiding undesirable behavior, crisis communication, and risk perception. Their review clearly indicates that, while a wide variety of medical and public health strategies (e.g., developing new vaccines or tracing contacts and movements) can be used to fight against COVID\u201019, behavioral sciences and behavioral interventions can be used to change humans' knowledge, judgment, decision\u2010making, and actual behavior (e.g., improving handwashing and knowing how to self\u2010isolate).",

The possible manuscripts could concern case studies (e.g., Bao, this issue), literature review (e.g., Gaspar, Yan, & Domingos, 2019), empirical studies (e.g., Pandey et al., 2020), theoretical (see Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies's [HBET] call for papers on a special issue on theoretical studies), and methodological (see HBET's call for papers on a special issue on methodological studies). We need to study what kinds of people (e.g., elder and young patients) have used emerging technologies to fight against the pandemic, what specific emerging technologies (e.g., social video games and Zoom) have been used, how new human\u2010technology interactions (e.g., binge screen viewing and large\u2010scale distance learning) have been taking place, and why various positive and negative behavioral impacts (e.g., the Cabin Fever effect and the digital vision syndrome) has been generated. These efforts will help us understand human behavior with technologies in both extreme events and ordinary events, and take us one step closer to answer the basic question of how humans behave with emerging technologies.",
