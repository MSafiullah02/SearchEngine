They presented with features of a viral respiratory illness with complaints of fever, cough, headache and breathlessness.

The macrophages present CoV antigens to the T cell subsets (Th 17) which lead to a massive release of various cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-21, TNF-b and MCP-1. This is responsible for the immune amplification. These cytokines and chemokines are responsible for recruitment of lymphocytes and other leukocytes to the site of inflammation. This immune amplification is partly responsible for the tissue damage in the respiratory alveoli, bronchioles, pulmonary interstitial walls etc. The increased expression of the inflammatory mediators has a down regulatory effect on NK cells and CD8 cells, which are important for the lymphocytes to clear the virus. Binding of the S-protein to various host cell receptors like ACE2 and DPP4R enables the viral RNA to gain entry in the host cell cytoplasm. Various toll like receptors (TLR) like TLR-3, TLR-4 are important to either evade the immune response or recognition of S-protein. The S-protein recognition leads to activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.38\n",

The infections vary in clinical manifestations from self limiting viral respiratory tract infections or gastroenteritis to severe form like the SARS-CoV-1, MERS and the recent SARS-CoV-2 infections. These have led to a significant morbidity and mortality and a global economic crisis. Newer developments in therapeutics, preventive therapy in the form of chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are underway. Newer information about the molecular mechanisms, clinical manifestations, epidemiological pattern and preventive public measures is available each week in all the scientific or medical journals. In addition lot of input is being provided by electronic and print media for public awareness. Only few articles published in the initial phase of COVID-19 epidemic have been cited to maintain brevity of the article. It will not be appropriate if a little note is not made about the unsung heroes of this pandemic. The world\u2019s \u2018new heroes\u2019 are the medical workers. The doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and other health care workers who are directly or indirectly involved with patient care in isolation wards and critical care areas. They risk their own lives, knowing that there are no effective drugs or vaccines available at present. They are on the frontline of a new kind of war according to Stephen Collinson, CNN new analyst.39 At least 23 physicians treating such patients have died in Italy. A number of doctors have died in France and China, including Dr. Li Wenliang, who was the first to alert the world. Health care professionals face lot of psychological stress as many patients die in this type of scenario. Prioritizing scarce health care resources is a challenge for them. Lack of masks, gloves, scrub-suits, equipment like ventilators, ECMO machines, dialysis machines etc. is a problem in developed and developing countries alike. However, they still head on to confront this new war of emerging infections like Ebola virus and SARS-CoV 1 and 2.",
