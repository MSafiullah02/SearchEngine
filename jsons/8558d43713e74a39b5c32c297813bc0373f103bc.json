Litter mass was positively associated with above-ground production (ANPP) in semi-arid grasslands (Willms et al. 1993; Deutsch et al. 2010 ) through its effect on enhancing available soil water to the plant. However, its effectiveness depends on the climatic conditions within a year (Willms et al. 1993 ) and the characteristics of the plant community. The effectiveness of litter mass among communities is inversely correlated with soil water; therefore, it is most effective where water deficits are greatest and least effective where available soil water is high. However, this relationship is likely not linear because too much litter will impede production in the more mesic tallgrass prairie (Knapp & Seastedt 1986) . Thus, the effectiveness of litter on ANPP reaches a threshold after which it declines with increasing litter mass.",

However, litter may not be as effective on the typical steppe as it is on the Northern Great Plains because of differences in precipitation distribution. In Inner Mongolia, about 70% of annual precipitation occurs in June, July and August, with only about 4% occurring from December to March. This compares with summer and winter precipitation, for the same months, of 38% and 20%, respectively, of total annual precipitation at two widely separated sites in the mixed prairie in Canada (W.D. Willms, pers. observ.) . Therefore, snow capture and retention is relatively less important on the typical steppe than in the mixed prairie, while the coincidence of the majority of precipitation with the growing season ensures that the plant is able to use it with maximum efficiency. These dynamics may contribute to forage production, which is about twice as high on the typical steppe as on the mixed prairie, despite receiving about 18% less precipitation, while ANPP in the mixed prairie may increase by up to 60% along a gradient of increasing litter mass (Willms et al. 1993) . Similar observations of litter mass and ANPP are not available for the typical steppe.",

The effect of litter on ANPP is related to its ability to conserve soil moisture by reducing evaporation and ensuring its availability to the plant. This assumes that water is available for conservation and that conserving it will benefit plant production. In our study, a relatively weak response to litter removal or addition indicates that these assumptions were relatively unimportant for total ANPP, possibly because most precipitation occurred during the warmest months of the growing season when water demand by plants was high. Therefore, available soil moisture would have a shortened residence time in the soil and be less vulnerable to evaporation. Furthermore, the lack of winter precipitation also indicates that the potential snow retention properties of litter is irrelevant, which is reflected in the absence of an effect produced by litter removal or addition in autumn or spring.",

The apparent link of litter to moisture effectiveness was also noted by Willms et al.

Therefore, litter may not be effective when soil moisture is severely deficient or in abundant supply.

Precipitation in 2005 was almost 50% of the long-term average, which may have produced unusual stress on the species and a more distinct response to litter removal. Our inability to detect differences in soil moisture may reflect the greater proportional losses of water through transpiration.
