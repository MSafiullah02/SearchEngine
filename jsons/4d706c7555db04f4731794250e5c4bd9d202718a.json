While BCG provides protection against disseminated TB in infants, its protection against adult pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is variable. To achieve the ambitious goal of eradicating TB worldwide by 2050, there is an urgent need to develop novel TB vaccines. Currently, there are more than a dozen novel TB vaccines including prophylactic and therapeutic at different stages of clinical research. This literature review provides an overview of the clinical status of candidate TB vaccines and discusses the challenges and future development trends of novel TB vaccine research in combination with the efficacy of evaluation of TB vaccines, provides insight for the development of safer and more efficient vaccines, and may inspire new ideas for the prevention of TB.",

It consists of four MTB antigens that are associated with virulence (Rv2608, Rv3619, and Rv3620) or latent (Rv1813) as well as TLR-4 ligand GLA-SE adjuvant [47, 48] . In preclinical studies, the ID93 + GLA-SE vaccine has been found to be effective for preventing infection of sensitive and resistant MTB in mice and guinea pigs [49] [50] [51] [52] . As a therapeutic vaccine, it can significantly improve the effect of anti-TB antibiotics in mice and non-human primates [53] . Additionally, the study also found that guinea pigs immunized with ID93 + GLA-SE showed a negative DTH response to intradermal PPD, which, in turn, did not interfere with the auxiliary diagnosis of a PPD skin test [54] . The vaccine has been used in two phase I clinical trials in the USA and South Africa. A phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT01599897) in the USA included 60 healthy adults with no history of BCG vaccination who were negative for QuantiFERON-TB Gold and were intramuscularly injected with 3-needle ID93 and ID93 + GLA-SE vaccine. Researcher found that all dose levels of ID93 and ID93 + GLA-SE were acceptably safe. Compared with ID93 alone, this vaccine elicited higher titers of ID93-specific antibodies, preferentially increasing IgG1 and IgG3 antibody subclass and significantly inducing a multifunctional cytokine profile of CD4 + T cells [55] . Another phase Ib trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01927159) from South Africa also found that ID93 + GLA-SE was well tolerated, with no serious vaccine-related adverse events and vaccination-induced long-lasting antigenspecific IgG and Th1 cell responses, and that effects peaked after a second vaccination. At the same time, vaccine doses did not affect the frequency or severity of adverse events, while mild injection-site adverse reactions and flu-like symptoms were common in MTB-infected subjects compared with those not infected with MTB [56] . In addition, the USA (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT03722472) and South Korea (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT03806699) are also undergoing two phase I clinical trials in healthy adults and BCG-vaccinated adolescent, both of which are expected to be completed in 2020. In January 2017, a phase IIa clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02465216) of the ID93 + GLA-SE vaccine was carried out in South Africa to assess the safety and immunogenicity of TB-HIV co-infected adults following treatment completion. Phase IIb clinical trial in the same population intended to prevent TB recurrence are being prepared.",

In preclinical studies, GSK 692342 has been shown to induce more efficient immune responses in animal models than either Mtb32 or Mtb39 alone [63] as well as more efficient protection than BCG alone in mice, guinea pigs, and non-human primate [63, 64] . In clinical phase II trials, GSK 692342 has been shown to have clinically acceptable safety and to induce strong humoral and cellular immunity in healthy and HIV-infected populations (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01262976), TB-infected adults (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01424501), and adolescents with PPD negative or positive skin reactivity (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00397943, NCT00621322 and NCT00950612) [58, [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . At present, M72/AS01 E has been tested in completed phase IIb clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01755598) in Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia. HIVnegative LTBI adults were randomized to receive two doses of M72/AS01 E or placebo to study the occurrence of active PTB unrelated to HIV infection and its safety or immunogenicity. Ten patients in the vaccine group were confirmed to have active PTB by bacteriology compared with 22 from the placebo group. The primary analysis of this trial showed a 54% (90% CI: 14-75; P = 0.04) point estimate of vaccine efficacy over about 2 years of follow-up [73] .",

It was developed by the University of Zaragoza, Pasteur Institute, and Biofabri with support from TBVI. MTBVAC is the only TB vaccine based on attenuated MTB, which is entering clinical trials [91, 92] . It is intended to serve as a preventive vaccine for newborns and replace BCG as well as to be a booster vaccine for adolescents and adults. However, it is likely to be subject to the same interference caused by prior immunological sensitization by NTMs as reported for BCG. Phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02013245) conducted in Switzerland in 2013 found that, among 18-to 45-year-old healthy adults, the MTBVAC vaccine had similar levels of safety to BCG and that no significant adverse events were caused by different doses. All vaccinated people were negative for IGRA at follow-up after 210 days of inoculation [93] . In May 2018, phase Ib clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02729571) were completed in adults and infants. The first stage includes 18 HIV-uninfected, QFT-negative, BCG-vaccinated adult participants, randomized 1:1 to receive BCG Vaccine SSI or MTBVAC at equivalent dose, and the second stage was commence in 36 HIV-unexposed, BCG-na\u00efve newborn infants, randomized 1:3 to receive BCG Vaccine SSI or MTBVAC at one of three different dose levels. Two phase Ib/IIa clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03536117 and NCT02933281) and epidemiological studies (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03536117) have recently been carried out by Aeras and Biofabri with adults and/or infants in South Africa.",

For unknown reasons, a BCG revaccination or \"booster,\" while not toxic, does not provide much additional protection. In 1995, the WHO issued the \"Global Tuberculosis Program and Global Program on Vaccine: Statement on BCG Revaccination for the Prevention of Tuberculosis,\" which concluded that the revaccination effect of BCG could not be confirmed. WHO does not advocate to revaccinate, and it is not necessary to vaccinate anyone for multiple times [94] . After the announcement of the statement, the countries that implemented the BCG revaccination policy stopped the strategy, and China also stopped the revaccination policy of BCG in 1997. At present, only a few countries in the world still implement revaccination strategies, and some even inoculate many times. With the emergence of a large number of MDR-TB and TB-HIV co-infection at the end of the twentieth century, WHO issued another position paper on BCG in 2004 [95] . The position paper states that revaccination of BCG in individuals who are positive for TST (whether or not the positive result is caused by NTM, MTB infection, or BCG vaccination) does not improve its immunity against TB. But, if the TST is negative and inevitably close to MDR-TB, BCG may be considered. However, the 2018 [96] position paper replaces the 2004 WHO position paper on BCG vaccine and the 2007 [97] WHO revised BCG vaccination guidelines for infants at risk for HIV infection. It incorporates recent developments in the TB field, provides revised guidance on the immunization of children infected with HIV, and reemphasizes the importance of the birth dose. The 2018 position paper shows minimal or no evidence of any additional benefit of repeat BCG vaccination against TB or leprosy. Therefore, revaccination is not recommended even if the TST reaction or result of interferon-\u03b3release assays (IGRA) is negative. In addition, the absence of a BCG scar after vaccination is not indicative of a lack of protection and is not an indication for revaccination. But, BCG vaccination of unvaccinated, TST-negative or IGRA-negative school children is recommended for those coming from or moving to high incidence/burden settings, as well as older groups at risk through occupational exposure.",

Interestingly, Use of an in vitro model of human PBMC induced with a repeat dose of BCG at 24 and 72 h of cell culture demonstrated increased anti-BCG IgG levels in supernatants compared with the preboost and control groups [101] . Several human clinical studies have performed an analysis of the effects of BCG revaccination in the HIV-1-uninfected (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02378207 and NCT02075203), BCG-na\u00efve healthy adults (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03175380), and LTBI (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01119521). Now, a phase IIb (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04152161) study of the vaccine by Aeras, in collaboration with partners including the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI) and the Emavundleni Research Centre found that, while BCG revaccination did not demonstrate efficacy in preventing initial MTB infection (defined as QFT conversion at an IFN-\u03b3 level of \u2265 0.35 IU per ml after day 84), it did result in significantly reduced rates of sustained QFT conversion (defined as three consecutive positive QFT results after day 84) [102] . These findings have fuelled renewed interest in the potential utility of BCG revaccination and prompted consideration of BCG revaccination in certain settings as part of an overall improved TB vaccination strategy, although it is not clear to what extent cellular and/or humoral immunity contribute to this protection.",

LLO is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that forms a transmembrane \u03b2-barrel-like pore in the phagocytic lysosomal membrane, allowing Listeria monocytogenes to escape to the cytosol [104, 105] . Urease inhibits Phagocytic lysosome maturation and improves the survival of MTB in macrophages [106, 107] . Studies have found that the elimination of urease C promotes phagocytic lysosomal fusion while providing optimal pH for LLO stability [104] . Therefore, expression of LLO in VPM1002 leads to the release of bacterial antigens and DNA into the cytosol, ultimately triggering autophagy and apoptosis [103] .",

Vaccines that have been preclinically evaluated need to undergo phase I, II, and III clinical trials before obtaining registration approval. It may even be necessary to design phase IV clinical trials to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of post-marketing vaccines in practical populations. The clinical evaluation of novel TB vaccines is based on TB incidence in phase III clinical results. Vaccine efficacy is evaluated by comparing the difference in TB incidence between the vaccine and placebo groups. The WHO required novel TB vaccines to have a protective power of at least 50%. Phase I and II clinical trials are a relatively simple means of evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of novel TB vaccines. However, due to long-term and delayed recurrence of MTB infection, efficacy evaluation of TB vaccines in phase III clinical trials typically requires a follow-up of at least 2-5 years for large samples.",

Researcher of phase I and phase II clinical studies of vaccines for neonates or uninfected individuals have tended to find that vaccine groups can induce cytokine production as well as enhancing anti-TB immune response. However, when clinically evaluating the LTBI adult prophylactic vaccine, immunized subjects were infected with MTB, and sensitization states and immune markers of the body were found to differ from those who were uninfected. A series of immune indicators commonly used to evaluate vaccines for neonates or uninfected individuals have been positive prior to vaccination. Whether changes in these indicators following vaccination can be applied to the clinical evaluation of LTBI anti-vaccination vaccines remains unknown. Therefore, it is even more rare if a standard set of parameters allows accurate comparisons between studies and vaccines to determine whether this is a reproducible in clinical trials. At present, novel vaccines for TB in phase III clinical trials are MIP/ Immuvac, Vaccae\u2122, and VPM1002, and no relevant research data have been published [146, 147] .",

While some novel vaccine candidates have achieved certain effects in animal models, how to apply them to humans and whether they can replace BCG still requires a long period of experimentation, follow-up, and demonstration. MVA85A is the first new TB vaccine to receive much attention in the past 90 years. In preclinical animal models, MVA85A was found to significantly enhance BCG immunogenicity priming in guinea pigs, rhesus monkeys, and cattle [148] . Its safety and tolerability have also been validated in phase I and phase IIa clinical trials in healthy adults and TBand HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents [40, [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] . However, in a phase IIb clinical trial conducted in South Africa in 2013, it was found that healthy infants who had been vaccinated with BCG and immunized with MVA85A did not have additional protection [157] . This result was a great disappointment to both the TB vaccine research community and funders and a call to action for researchers in basic and applied vaccine development. At the same time, this lesson suggests that some of the results obtained in preclinical animal models do not align with results of clinical trials. Therefore, the development of novel TB vaccines continues to face many challenges.",

However, the correlation between these specific immune cells or cytokines in the host's immune protection against natural TB infection needs further study [161] . Animal experiments have provided evaluation of vaccines in terms of immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy. Mouse models have the advantages of low price, strong viability, and easy access to detection reagents, meaning they are the first choice for the evaluating the preliminary effects of novel vaccines [162] . However, mouse models do not accurately reflect the authenticity of vaccine protection, especially when studying the longacting immune protection response. Therefore, the use of mouse models to evaluate the effect of novel TB vaccines may result in a deviation from the actual clinical application effect [163] . In addition, evaluation results from the same vaccines in different animal models were inconsistent, with mice and guinea pigs achieving good immunoprotective effects, which failed in non-human primates [164] . Infection and disease manifestations of MTB vary from species to species, and immune response following vaccination is more variable in humans [23] . Therefore, differences between humans and animals may be one of the main factors affecting the predictive ability of animal models. (4) Lack of emulated exposure methods: A significant difference exists in the nature of exposure between animal models and natural human infections. In preclinical animal models, MTB are initially infected by high-dose, single-strain, single exposure through various routes of attack (such as aerosol, tail vein, or intraperitoneal injection). However, in natural conditions, humans often experience multiple low doses, and infections are established following exposure to different strains [165] . (5) Lack of a unified clinical trial endpoint criteria: Reducing the incidence of TB and improving the disease status of patients are the main criteria for evaluating TB vaccines. In preclinical animal models, the effectiveness of vaccines tends to be assessed by improvements in organ bacterial counts, histopathological damage, and time of animal death. In contrast, scientists use TB incidence as an end point of human clinical trials. Obviously, there is a fundamental difference and lack of relevance between preclinical trials and clinical trials in determining the endpoint of vaccine effectiveness.",

In contrast, preclinical animal models tend to use specific pathogen-free animals with a consistent genetic background. (7) Immunization population is complicated: When compared with other infectious disease vaccines, a difficulty in researching novel TB vaccines is that the immune status of the vaccination population or infection background is complicated. The widespread vaccination of BCG and NTM infections in countries that have high rates of TB further exacerbates the complexity of vaccination populations. In particular, whether a vaccination with a strong immunogenic vaccine in the LTBI population leads to a Koch response is a safety issue that cannot be ignored. Therefore, those who are BCG na\u00efve, negative, or maintain positive after BCG vaccination and LTBI need to be accurately differentiated and accurately immunized to optimize vaccination effectiveness.",

In the past 30 years, TB vaccines have developed greatly, and vaccine candidates for different age groups and different forms of TB have emerged. Despite disappointing results from some of the clinical efficacy trials, these experiences are sufficient to remind us to revisit the design and evaluation of TB vaccines. Today, we are witnessing immense progress in both preclinical and clinical TB vaccine research. With the continuous coordination and cooperation of the TB vaccine community, building a world free of TB may be just around the corner. ",
