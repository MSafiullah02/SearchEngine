At the University Hospital of Padova, located at the centre of an outbreak, among 146 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a mean age of 65.3 years, 13 had pre-existing diabetes, yielding a prevalence of 8.9% (95% CI 5.3-14.6). For comparison, the prevalence of diabetes in the same Region in 2018 was 6.2% overall and 11.0% among people aged 55-75 years (mean 65) [3] . A relatively low prevalence of diabetes among SARS-CoV-2 infected people could be due to under-reporting, chance, or a biological phenomenon. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) was discovered as a receptor for middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus while SARS-CoV-2 appears to use preferentially angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to enter the cell [4] . However, since DPP-4 inhibitors are popular glucose-lowering medications worldwide, it will be of interest to explore whether they might protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
