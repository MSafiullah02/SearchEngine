            "text": "Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a member of the Protoparvovirus genus (family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae) and, together with feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), it was recently included in the unique specie Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (Cotmore et al., 2014; Tijssen et al., 2011). CPV is a small, non-enveloped, linear single-stranded DNA virus. Its genome consists of an approximately 5200 nucleotide (nt) DNA molecule containing two open reading frames (ORFs), encoding respectively for two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and for two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2) through alternative splicing of the same mRNAs (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012; Reed et al., 1988). VP2 is the major capsid protein, representing the major determinant of host range (Hueffer et al., 2003) and being subject to antibody mediated selection (Nelson et al., 2007). For this reason, over the years most studies were focused on the evolution of the VP2 gene, with limited studies on the nonstructural genes (Hoelzer et al., 2008). Also NS gene sequences available in GenBank are relatively few if compared to partial or total length VP2 sequences.",

            "text": "CPV emerged in late 1970s as host variant of FPLV or FPLV-like parvovirus (Parrish et al., 1991), causing acute gastroenteritis, leukopenia and myocarditis in dogs. Amino acids changes between CPV and FPLV affect the VP2 domain interacting with the host-cell transferrin receptor (TfR) and may have contributed to CPV ability of binding domestic dog TfR, which has been recognized as the determinant for the canine host shift (Hueffer et al., 2003; Shackelton et al., 2005). Soon after its emergence, the original type CPV-2 was rapidly and totally replaced by different CPV variants commonly named, on the basis of differences observed in the VP2 amino acid (aa) residue 426, as CPV-2a (Asn), CPV-2b (Asp) and CPV-2c (Glu) (Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Decaro et al., 2005; Parrish et al., 1985, Parrish et al., 1988, Parrish et al., 1991). Over the years many other changes have arisen in the VP2 gene and some of them (Ser297Ala, Thr440Ala, Tyr324Ile) were reported in several countries (Battilani et al., 2002; Decaro et al., 2009a; Geng et al., 2015; Ikeda et al., 2000; Jeoung et al., 2008; Mittal et al., 2014; Truyen, 1999; Truyen et al., 2000). Although CPV-2a and CPV-2b variants showing Ala at aa 297 were designated respectively as \u201cnew CPV-2a\u201d and \u201cnew CPV-2b\u201d (Decaro et al., 2009a; Ohshima et al., 2008), CPV strains with others specific changes (Thr440Ala, Tyr324Ile) did not receive any clear taxonomical or common designation, despite their presence in strains detected in large different geographical areas. For instance, the VP2 change Tyr324Ile may be considered a common change in CPV strains of Asian countries (Geng et al., 2015). Therefore, current typing of CPV variants (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, new CPV-2a, new CPV-2b) reported in the literature is based mainly on antigenic and genetic features at critical residues on the VP2 sequence (aa 297 and 426). The aim of this paper is the characterization of eight new CPV-2a strains collected from dogs in Italy between November 2016 and May 2017, which have shown common specific nucleotide and amino acid changes. The detection of CPV strains with unique molecular features can contribute to better understand the genetic diversity and molecular evolution of this canine virus. Moreover, the characterization of both viral ORFs provides useful data for further epidemiological and evolutionary analyses, improving the limited information on NS1 sequence of circulating CPV strains.",

Therefore, a continuous epidemiological surveillance is needed to detect new CPV variants (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012). The aim of this study was to analyze and describe unreported molecular features of CPV strains recovered from dogs in southern Italy. The genetic analysis was carried out on both CPV open reading frames, thus representing the first study on the complete genome of Italian strains. The present study led to the identification of a novel CPV-2a mutant, displaying previously unreported molecular features. Considering the established role of key residues of the VP2 protein, the main finding was observed at the critical amino acid residue 324 (Tyr324Leu). This finding provides new insight into the evolution of the VP2 protein gene, although further studies are needed to fully understand the biological and immunological role of this amino acid change. The full-length genomes provided in the present study will help further characterization of circulating strains, with particular regards to the analysis of the NS1 gene for which only few sequences are currently available.",

This residue is adjacent to aa residue 323, which affects canine transferrin receptor (TfR) binding (Hafenstein et al., 2007; Hueffer et al., 2003; Mittal et al., 2014), contributing to viral replication into canine cells and determining the pH dependence of haemagglutination (Chang et al., 1992).

Instead, a convergent evolution could be speculated that resulted in the same aa substitution even with different nt mutations. Moreover, the lack of related CPV sequences from the same area prevented any further speculation about the origin of the mutant. Therefore, only extensive and retrospective sequence analyses could clarify whether these mutant emerged from CPV strains previously circulating in the same geographic area or was imported from different countries. Another change affecting the same residue (Tyr324Ile) was observed since 2006 (Jeoung et al., 2008) and it became predominant in Asia in 2014 (Zhou et al., 2017). This substitution was observed in 100% of recently analyzed Asian strains (Geng et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2015) and can result in a stronger receptor binding (Cs\u00e1gola et al., 2014).

            "text": "To date, a little information is available for changes in the NS1 protein and for their potential role. NS1 is a multifunctional nuclear phosphoprotein responsible for viral replication, cellular transcription and cell death inducing apoptosis (Gupta et al., 2016; Saxena et al., 2013). Only recently some of CPV NS1 amino acids were associated to specific functions (Niskanen et al., 2010, Niskanen et al., 2013). In order to contribute to future studies on this gene, we provided a complete genome NS1 sequencing for a number of CPV strains.",
