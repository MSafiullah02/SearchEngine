Viruses in this family have characteristic petal-shaped projections called spike proteins that protrude from the virus particle (Pedersen, 1983), giving it a crown-like appearance, hence the name \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, when viewed under an electron microscope. These glycoproteins play a key role in attachment of the virus to the surface proteins on the host cell, which act as receptors for the virus (Hartmann, 2005).",

            "text": "FCoV is distributed worldwide in both domestic and wild cats, especially in overcrowded environments (Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979, Barlough et al., 1983). In cats, the most common route of FCoV infection is oral transmission following contact with virus-containing feces (Pedersen et al., 1995). FCoV are of two subtypes\u2014feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (Pedersen et al., 1981). FECV is widespread and often causes asymptomatic or mild enteric infections, while FIPV causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is a fatal immune-mediated disease (Can-Sahna et al., 2007). Since FIPV arises from mutations in FECV, several reports have suggested that mutation of the avirulent FECV genome alters the cell tropism of the virus, resulting in a virulent variant that induces FIP (Vennema et al., 1992, Vennema et al., 1995, Benetka et al., 2004). Recently, it was reported that mutations in the furin cleavage site between the receptor-binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains of the spike protein could result in altered cell tropism because of the modifications in the spike epitope structure (Licitra et al., 2013).",

Non-specific clinical signs and lack of pathognomonic hematological and biochemical abnormalities hinder definitive diagnosis of FIP in veterinary practices. The tests for detecting the presence of coronavirus antibodies or viral genome, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can suggest a prior exposure to coronavirus or the presence of coronavirus genome (Addie et al., 2003, Hartmann, 2005, Brown et al., 2009). However, CCoV also has a potential to induce enteritis or infectious peritonitis in cats (McArdle et al., 1992, Hartmann, 2005), and TGEV can be carried by asymptomatic cats or cats with mild enteritis (Saif and Sestak, 2006). Thus, a rapid and reliable method that can detect and differentiate FCoV simultaneously from CCoV and TGEV would be very useful for the identification of FCoV-infected cats (i.e., potential spreaders of FIPV) as well as for the isolation of FCoV-infected cats from unaffected cats in order to prevent the spread of the virus in a cattery.",

Cloning was confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid DNA was purified by using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and quantified by spectrophotometry. Each recombinant vector was diluted in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated distilled, deionized water by a 10-fold serial-dilution technique. The analytic sensitivity of the test was assessed in triplicate as singleplex (i.e., individual PCR for each recombinant vector) or multiplex assay on serially diluted recombinant vectors. Each PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and scanned under ultraviolet illumination. The band intensity of the image was converted to the corresponding numerical data by using the SigmaScan Pro, version 6.0.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) and analyzed by using the SigmaPlot version 12.5 (IBM). The reaction fidelity between dilutions and the overall detection efficacy were compared between the singleplex assay and the multiplex assay.",

In this study, the sequences of M gene targeted by CCoV-specific and TGEV-specific primers showed minimal consistent differences (three bases and one base, respectively). Thus, inosine was used to allow primer binding. Inosine is a synthetic universal base that can bind any of the four natural nucleotide bases in DNA (Hill et al., 1998). The primers containing inosine thus compensate for the high rate of degeneracy of the target sequence and can substantially reduce the overall primer degeneracy and false priming by overcoming individual nucleotide mismatch (Knoth et al., 1988). In this study, CCoV- and TGEV-specific primer contained inosine in the 3\u2032-terminal sequence, and the analytic performance showed good discriminating capacity among FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV simultaneously.",

The multiplex PCR includes more than one primer pair that increases the possibility of mis-pairing or dimer formation (i.e., hairpin, self, or cross-dimer), resulting in a decrease in the reaction efficiency. Considering these factors, the primer sequences were selected based on the lowest possibility of mis-paring or dimer formation, as estimated by the secondary structure or \u0394G value for the primer itself or among all primers. For the enzyme, an enzyme mixture with hot-start function was evaluated to confirm that the reaction efficiency between the enzyme mixtures was not different. Evaluation of the annealing temperature of the multiplex assay ranging from 46 \u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C also revealed that the highest reaction efficiency was obtained with 50 \u00b0C temperature, suggesting that the reaction condition of singleplex assay was suitable for multiplex assay.",

Phagocytosis by macrophages is a key event in the pathogenesis of FIP. However, FECV can also induce viremia without phagocytosis, suggesting that FECV and FIPV cannot be differentiated based on the evaluations of peripheral blood samples (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998). In addition, mutations in the FECV genome can change the surface structures of the virus to enable phagocytosis by macrophages (Vennema et al., 1992, Vennema et al., 1995, Benetka et al., 2004). As described above, CCoV and TGEV can also be isolated from cats (McArdle et al., 1992, Hartmann, 2005, Saif and Sestak, 2006). Thus, the rapid detection and isolation of FCoV-infected cats is the only effective preventive strategy to avoid spread of coronaviruses. For this purpose, a PCR test was developed for detecting and differentiating FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV. It is expected that the proposed multiplex RT-PCR assay will enable detection and discrimination of FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV at a lower cost and in less time than individual tests and thus prevent unnecessary isolation or euthanasia of FCoV-uninfected cats due to misdiagnosis.",
