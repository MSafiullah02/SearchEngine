They conclude that chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 and may be considered as a primary tool for the current COVID-19 detection in epidemic areas [4]. However, the strategy of using CT as a screening method does not appear to be supported by solid basis. Using CT in screening and/or asymptomatic patients, the probability to find radiological signs of COVID-19 infection is low and therefore the use of CT would lead to many negative tests (even in patients with rRT-PCR positive tests), thus increasing the workload of the radiology departments and the risk of transmission of the infection.",
