With the completion of the Human Genome Project and accompanying advances in the development of new genetic tools and technologies, there are unprecedented opportunities to discover genes that produce vulnerability to mental disorders. This research program at NIMH is intended to accelerate the discovery of such genes and characterize the genetic basis of disorders directly relevant to NIMH's mission, through the application of cutting edge genomic-based approaches and methods. The research supported by this program will accelerate the development of pharmacogenomics, diagnostics, therapeutics and effective prevention strategies for mental disorders. Responsibilities will include developing new research initiatives, administering and managing an extramural portfolio of research awards, and interacting with researchers and related programs at NIMH, NIH, and other funding agencies (both public and private, in the U.S. and abroad). Candidates must be a U.S. citizen and have an M.D., Ph.D., or equivalent-level degree and considerable research experience in human genetics. Preference will be given to candidates with experience in research management. Experience in genomics-based genotyping, target validation and drug discovery is highly desirable. The ability to work both independently and collaboratively is required. Strong communication, writing and organizational skills are also required. The position will be fi lled on a permanent basis. Salary will be commensurate with experience. Send CV, bibliography and the names of 4 references by email to Dr. ",
