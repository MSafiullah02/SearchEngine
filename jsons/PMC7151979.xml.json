The simplest natural occurring instance of fusion is the coalescence of two miscible liquid droplets in air, whose two outer molecular layers merge into one. But these layers can dive into the interior, any given molecule is an ephemeral rather than integral part of the droplet's surface. Films made of soap or protein (e.g., bubbles made by children from detergent or blowing bubbles in their milk) provide a better model, and we have all seen them fuse and lyse before our eyes. However, they also have surfaces that can exchange with a bulky interior, and their width can vary. These films are unlike the biological membrane in that their apolar moities face the low dielectric air rather than the high dielectric watery interior of the film. The biological membrane is composed of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates of varying chemical structure. It exists within the context of an aqueous cellular environment that prefers to avoid the interior of the membrane fusion. This entropically-driven hydrophobic effect leads to two important constraints on topological transformations, (1) a tension at the interface of the polar head groups of the lipids to resist any stretching, and (2) a uniform thickness which is primarily determined by the lipid constituents.",

Since the number of phospholipids molecules far outnumber the other constituents, membrane entropy is dominated by the thermodynamics of the lipids themselves, and thus it is likely that whatever is learned from investigations of lipid bilayer fusion will inform us about biological membrane fusion. Indeed, it seems that many of the key intermediates of membrane fusion are the same in the fusion of synthetic and natural membranes.[1], [2], [3] We will not cover this ground, as many excellent reviews serve this purpose.[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] Rather, in this chapter we will introduce a number of controversies that the reader may be stimulated to solve.",

            "text": "In general there are a number of energy barriers that prevent fusion from proceeding spontaneously. First and foremost, there is the fact that in distilled water and dilute solutions of monovalent salt, all lipid bilayers resist close approach with a force that rises exponentially from an equilibrium distance of about 2 nm. With divalent cations in the solution bathing the membranes, close approach is possible, depending upon the lipid composition. This is readily seen as exchange of components in the contacting leaflets.[11], [12] Presumably, this occurs through minute and transient contact sites in which the contacting leaflets are joined (hemifusion). However, this is not generally sufficient either for membrane fusion or the formation of an extended diaphragm composed of the outer, or non-contacting leaflets of the joining bilayers (termed hemifusion diaphragm),13 for there are energetic restrictions to the widening of the hemifusion intermediate that joins the two leaflets (termed a stalk,[14], [15], [16]). The main way to facilitate the formation of a stable hemifusion diaphragm is to add hydrocarbon solvent to the membrane, so as to lower the energy of the three-way junction between the two bilayers and the joined diaphragm.[17], [18]\n",

A relatively long-lived fusion pore is universal in biological fusion, regardless of whether exocytosis, viral fusion, or cell-cell fusion is studied. Since its discovery as a sub-ultrastructural entity, its architecture and composition has been in debate. In part, this is because of two very different views of the mechanism of membrane fusion: lipid centric and protein centric. In the lipid centric view, proteins surround a fusion site, and the conformational energy of the protein (as it transitions from a pre-fusion to a post-fusion form) is harnessed into stressing the encircled lipids to the point of a spontaneous transition in topology along a well-studied set of molecular intermediates, first a hemifusion intermediate \u2013 the stalk \u2013 and then the fusion pore (Figure 1\n).[21], [24], [25] The prediction of this hypothesis is clear: the proteins should be outside of an hourglass-shaped pore scaffolded by proteins. In the protein-centric view, proteins link up the two membranes that are to fuse and make a solid proteinaceous connection, a potential channel that is first closed, then opens to form the initial fusion pore.3 The prediction of this hypothesis is also clear: the proteins should be at the center of the pore, surrounded and later infiltrated by lipids as the proteins dissociate to guide the topological change of the lipids. A direct method is needed to determine which of these predictions is met during different instances of biological fusion.",

In other words, it would be an electrostatic tunnel for membrane fusion that is extended by the polybasic linker regions of syntaxin and synaptobrevin.3 Variations of this model can account for many physiological pathways, including a small fraction of the vesicles that may already interacting at the level of the hemifusion prior to the entry of calcium. What is the role of calcium once it enters? First, Ca2+ turns on an \u2018electrostatic switch\u2019 initially proposed for synaptotagmin-syntaxin interaction, but better suited to instantaneously stressing the phospholipid bilayers of the presynaptic membrane and the synaptic vesicle for the ultra-rapid exocytosis seen in the nervous system. Second, even without synaptotagmin, Ca2+ speeds up fusion of SNARE-reconstituted membranes considerably. Perhaps divalent ions play a direct role, electrostatically complexing PS headgroups to promote fusion between negatively charged phospholipid bilayers. Is this effect specific for calcium over magnesium? There are indications that the spontaneous curvature of PS in the presence of calcium, but not magnesium, is significantly more negative with calcium than with magnesium.2 Ultimately, synaptotagmin, SNAREs, and the other proteins that comprise the exocytotic fusion machine must cajole lipids to move through a pathway that culminates in fusion pore opening. The SNARE proteins and synaptotagmin are the guides that walk and pull the membrane through a bumpy stalk-pore path, with electrostatic interactions playing a larger role than hitherto realized.20\n",

Consistent with this idea, spontaneous formation of extended coiled coils are observed in bacterially expressed HA2 polypeptide at neutral pH, indicating that the low pH trigger is not necessary for the extension of coiled coils.47 The prevailing hypothesis for the mechanism of how conformational changes lead to the fusion of two membranes is that extension of coiled coils triggered by the low pH directs the fusion peptide to insert into the target membrane, and then a helix-to-loop conformational change reorients the protein to pull the fusion peptide toward the transmembrane domain. These molecular transitions result in a tight packing of the COOH-terminus of HA2 against grooves of the NH2-terminal coiled coil, proceeding to the fusion of the two bilayers.[48], [49], [50] This hypothesis emphasizes that both the extension of the coiled coil and the bending of the protein resulting from the helix-to-loop conformational change are important for fusion. The experimental results favoring this hypothesis demonstrate that a double proline substitution mutant (F63P/F70P) at the region supposedly undergoing loop-to-helix conformational change upon low pH failed to induce fusion, although the mutant still presented and inserted the fusion peptide to the target membrane.50 The block to fusion was demonstrated to occur in the tight packing of COOH-terminal extended regions into the grooves between the helices of the NH2-terminal half of the coiled coil due to the splayed NH2-terminal half of HA2, suggesting that the insertion of fusion peptide into target membrane alone is not sufficient for fusion, and the tension caused by the packing of COOH-terminus against the NH2-terminus of HA2 may be the driving force for membrane merging. Another piece of evidence for the role of the packing of the COOH-terminus to the NH2-terminus in viral fusion is that the alanine substitution mutants at five apolar residues after the short COOH-terminus of HA2 fails to cause both lipid and content mixing.51\n",

When the target membrane is available, the fusion peptide inserts into the lipid bilayer to induce lipid mixing between the target cell membrane and the viral membrane. It has been experimentally determined that the free energy associated with the insertion of full-length fusion peptide into the lipid membrane is 4.5 kBT, and as many as 18 fusion peptides binding to the target membrane might generate enough energy to stabilize a stalk-like fusion intermediate, which has high membrane curvature.52 While necessary for fusion, the packing of fusion peptides does not appear to be sufficient for fusion. Lipids present in the membrane act together with HA to cause fusion. Changing membrane lipid physical properties or composition in ways that well defined also blocks fusion, despite conformational-specific antibody binding indicating that HA is in the post-fusion state.53 In other words the protein conformational change, while essential, is not sufficient, as there are post-protein conformational changes in lipid conformation that are needed for fusion to continue along its path. Thus the pathway of HA-mediated membrane fusion involves conformational changes to induce lipids to undergo the more general pathway outlined above for lipid membrane fusion.53\n",

            "text": "The role of the fusion peptide domain for HA-mediated membrane fusion has been the subject of many biophysical studies.54 The fusion peptide of HA is rich in glycine; for example, influenza A/X31/H3N2 contains 6 glycine residues in 20 residues of fusion peptide (GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGMIDG). Extensive mutagenesis studies of fusion peptides have revealed that both the primary sequence and the length of fusion peptide are crucial for HA fusogenic activity.55 For example, HA2 G1E substitution abolishes cell-cell and RBC-cell fusion activity of expressed HA, while G4E substitution decreases fusion efficiency and elevated the pH threshold for activation.56 Alanine can substitute for glycine at positions 1 and 4 without impacting HA-induced cell-cell fusion; however, the polar amino acid serine substitution for glycine at position 1 causes a hemifusion phenotype.38 The requirements for specific amino acids at certain positions and for a defined length in the fusion peptide have been further supported by the NMR-solved structure of fusion peptide in detergent micelles and in model lipid membranes[43], [52] stabilized by a charge-dipole interaction between the N-terminal Gly and the dipole moment of helix 254 (Figure 6\n). At acidic pH, the 20 residues of fusion peptide adopt a V-shaped \u2018boomerang\u2018 structure with an oblique NH2-terminal amphipathic helix spanning residues 2\u201310 and a turn formed by residues 11, 12 and 13 followed by a short COOH-terminal helix[43], [57] stabilized by a charge-dipole interaction between the N-terminal Gly and the dipole moment of helix 258 (Figure 6). The bent fusion peptide then may insert \u223c16\u201317 \u00c5 into the outer leaflet of the target membrane, almost to the mid-plane of the lipid bilayer with the residue Leu 2 and Phe 3 penetrating deepest into the membrane.[52], [57] In the solution structure, the hemifusion phenotype mutant G1S has a similar structure to that of wild type, but the glycine ridge on the outer surface of the NH2-terminal helical arm is disrupted. In contrast, the mutant G1V, where fusion is completely abolished, has a very irregular linear amphipathic helix instead of the fixed angled boomerang structure (Figure 6).[59], [60] Another fusion-defective mutant, W14A, has a more flexible kink than that of the wild type, in contrast, the alanine substitution at phenylalanine residue 9 (F9A) has a similar structure to that of the wild-type and has no defect in fusion (Figure 6).61 These studies suggest that both the angled and deeply inserted structure as well as the glycine ridge make a contribution to the fusion activity.",

Another open question is whether the HA conformational changes are strictly irreversible in the absence of a target membrane. The prevailing model that spring-loaded conformational changes are uni-directional is based in part on the fact that pre-treatment of virus particles from typical laboratory strains (e.g., the H3 strain X-31) with low pH effectively neutralizes infection. Analysis of other viral subtypes (e.g., H2) show features consistent with reversible conformational changes66 and many natural isolates of influenza do not show the irreversible conformational changes associated with X-31 in the absence of a target membrane (G. Whittaker personal communication). Tatulian and Tamm67 have demonstrated that the conformational change of the entire HA is reversible in the absence of bound target membranes.",

Because fusion peptides insert into target membranes and TMDs span the viral envelope, the folding of fusion proteins into hairpins brings the viral envelope and host cell membrane into proximity. Even for the two other classes of viral fusion proteins, which do not exhibit 6HBs and contain much \u03b2-sheet, in the final, post-fusion state, it is likely that fusion peptides and TMDs are proximal. It is not experimentally certain that this proximity occurs, because the hydrophobic TMDs and fusion peptides themselves are not present in the crystallized proteins. This apposition of the membrane imbedded TMD and fusion peptides of viral fusion proteins is similar to the proximity between TMDs of v- and t-SNAREs in their tetrameric coiled-coil. When the ubiquity of 6HBs was first demonstrated, it was assumed that bundle formation merely brought membranes into close contact, and fusion then occurred. We now know this is incorrect. The correlations between bundle formation and steps in the fusion process have been investigated for HIV-1 Env, Influenza HA, and ASLV Env. The precise steps of bundle formation depend on the precise protein. It appears that the longer the amino acid sequence that intervenes between TMDs and the coiled-coil, the earlier the bundle can form. For HIV-1 Env, which has a relatively short intervening sequence, not only does hemifusion occur prior to completion of bundle formation, but so does the creation of the initial fusion pore. Bundle formation releases considerable energy and the late occurrence of formation indicates that considerable energy is required for pore enlargement \u2013 the last step in fusion. In fact, several lines of evidence lead to the picture that hemifusion is energetically easy to achieve, pore formation more difficult, and pore enlargement even more difficult. From the theoretical point of view of membrane mechanics, considerable work must be expended to enlarge a fusion pore because additional membrane must be bent from its relaxed state as the pore enlarges.",

The mechanisms by which fusion proteins create the pore formation is less understood and how fusion proteins contribute to pore enlargement remains a mystery. For topological reasons, TMDs cannot span hemifusion diaphragms and can only enter the diaphragm from the junction between the diaphragm and the two original membranes. Common sense suggests that this entry of TMDs should destabilize the junction and thereby generate pores. This is consistent with demonstrations that TMDs are directly involved in pore formation68 and with theory that predicts that pores form at the junction. But why TMDs are forced through the junction has not been addressed and the determinants of pore properties are virtually uncharacterized. For example, some viral fusion proteins, such as HIV-1 Env, generate large initial pores than readily open whereas others, such as influenza HA, create small pores that generally flicker open and closed before they enlarge. It seems reasonable that differences in pores are conferred by the proteins (rather than by the lipids), but the field has not formulated guiding principles as to which structural features of a protein control pore properties. Because viral nucleocapsids can only enter cytosol if a pore enlarges, these questions are potentially of practical, in addition to biophysical, importance.",

These studies have greatly illuminated our understanding of the protein machines driving membrane fusion reviewed in Refs. [75], [76]. The minimal domains of SNARE proteins that can spontaneously engage in a stable 4-helix SNARE complex revealed a characteristic packing at the core of the SNARE complex. The majority of the packing interactions are hydrophobic, however there is an ionic layer typically consisting of a single arginine and three glutamine residues.[70], [74] This ionic layer is found at the mid-point of the coiled-coiled bundle and hence is referred to as the zero ionic layer. The zero ionic layer is an evolutionarily conserved feature of all SNARE complexes examined to date, however the functional role of this feature is not known. Biophysical characterization of SNARE complexes that perturb the zero ionic layer suggest that it may be important for the stability of SNARE complexes.77 One idea was that this layer could provide an intervention point for SNARE complex disassembly, however perturbation of the layer in an in vitro disassembly assay78 had no discernable impact on NSF/SNAP catalyzed SNARE disassembly. Current hypotheses for how polar zero layer residues might impact SNARE function favor potential role(s) in SNARE complex assembly, such as the suggestion that a polar zero layer helps align assembly of the SNARE helices in register, or in other downstream functions of the SNARE complex. Mutagenesis studies of the zero ionic layer in different systems suggest different effects, but they are all relatively subtle.[79], [80] Clearly, the influence of particular residues may vary according to the individual SNARE complex in question and the local parameters governing the assembly of a particular cognate SNARE complex.",

Once again, it is relatively straightforward to calculate the ring conditions that will lead to constriction and narrowing of the tube towards the center, as long as the distance between the two rings is not too short. But once again, we are faced with the hydration force resisting any further constriction of the neck, since the surfaces of the inner leaflet lipids would have to come closer than the 2 nm equilibrium distance between attractive dispersion forces and repulsive hydration forces. But lo, there is a new modality for minimizing energy in this system; it is the tilt-like movement of lipid head groups away from each other at the very center of the hourglass constriction of the neck (Figure 12(a), third panel). This tilting of the lipids at the center of the inner monolayer of the neck results in formation of a narrow separation of heads exposing the hydrophobic interior of the bilayers, termed a hydrophobic \u2018\u2018belt\u2019\u2019 to indicate its presence as a ring (you can visualize this ring by rotating the figures of Figure 12(a) around the axis of the horizontal dashed line under each bilayers). Now the repulsive hydration force stabilizing inner aqueous diameters of 2 nm gives way to a newly developed hydrophobic attractive force, which is effectively the desire of water to desolvate the space between the tilting headgroups in the center. This water ejection leads to the close approximation and finally merger of the neck with itself at the midpoint; that is, its closure.",

The energy barrier of 35 kBT is also similar to those calculated for membrane fusion,24 so it is energetically feasible.

Dynamin assembly shapes bilayers into highly curved structures (Figure 12). Assembly also greatly enhances the rate of GTP hydrolysis (100-fold),136 which in turn leads to dynamin disassembly. Thus, assembly is self-limited in the presence of GTP. Recent experiments suggest that assembly-induced GTPase activity reduces the interaction of dynamin with the highly curved lipid membrane even before disassembly.137 The result is the unstable, highly curved lipid neck described above that resolves either in membrane fission (endocytosis, described above), or reversal of high membrane curvature. From these studies, performed in model membranes, membrane fission may therefore be considered to be a stochastic result of GTP hydrolysis.[133], [139] Studies in adrenal chromaffin cells suggest that dynamin functions in a similar way to control the fate of a recently fused secretory granule. Increasing the dynamin GTPase activity increases the rate of fusion pore expansion and the likelihood of rapid endocytosis.138 The results are consistent with a function for dynamin in restricting fusion pore expansion. Increased GTP activity catalyzes a more rapid stochastic decision that results in either fusion pore expansion or (less frequently) membrane fission and endocytosis.",

We emphasize that despite decades of studies we still know only a little about fundamental physical principles underlying the spatial and temporal organization of membrane domains specialized in membrane remodeling. For example, the structure and composition of the fusion pore are unknown. New synergistic experimental and theoretical approaches are needed to resolve how proteins merge and separate membranes. For example, the ability to detect submicron deformations of the plasma membrane with the combination of polarization and TIRFM techniques[138], [139] permits detection of the expanding fusion pore and may enable investigations of the molecular basis for membrane curvature changes in living cells.",

Viral particles were purified by sucrose-gradient centrifugation, labeled with octadecyl rhodamine (R18) at a concentration such that R18 fluorescence was quenched, and bound to the surface of liposomes at pH 7.0. Fusion of these viral particles bound to liposomes was triggered by rapid acidification to pH 5.0, with fusion measured by monitoring an increase in the emission at 590 nm due to dequenching of R18 upon lipid-mixing of the viral envelope and the lipid membrane.

(a) The pathway of membrane rearrangement leading to the fission of a short membrane neck detached from a dynamin scaffold (blue) upon GTP hydrolysis; the upper half of the neck membrane is shown. The neck constriction is followed by rearrangement of the thinnest part of the neck: lipids, by synchronous tilting, expose a small part of the hydrophobic membrane interior (hydrophobic belt). If the radius of the neck at the midpoint (Rmid) is small enough, expansion of the belt correlated with thinning of the neck becomes possible, and the neck closes completely. The neutral surface 140 of the inner monolayer of the neck membrane is shown by the red line. The function R(L) describes the shape of this surface in the coordinate system (R, L); the coordinate center is placed in the midst of the neck (where Rmid is measured), so that the total length of the detached neck is 2L0. This length and the radius of the neck at both ends (R0) are fixed by the dynamin scaffold (note that R0 equals the radius of the nanotube in the dynamin-squeezed state and is about 0.5 nm bigger than the luminal radius, RL). (b) Calculated shapes of necks (R(L)) detached from the dynamin scaffold of different initial length (L0). Necks shorter than a critical length Lc (see [c]) narrow (Rmid<R0), whereas longer necks bulge; calculated 3D shapes of shortest and longest necks are shown. (c) Numerically calculated dependence of the Rmid of the neck length L0 for NT and wNT. From this dependence, the minimal radius of the neck (Rmin) and the critical length Lc (at which Rmid=R0) are determined. (d) Energy diagram showing the dependence of free energy of the neck (R0=2 nm) upon the width (H) and the radius (Rmid) of the hydrophobic belt. The energy barrier along the pathway indicated by the red arrow is \u223c35 kBT. (e) Dependence of the critical length, Lc, (blue) and the neck radius in the narrowest place, Rmin, (black) on R0.
