(12) It suggested two aspects which should be employed to prevent the spread of epidemics. One was to maintain and improve the healthy qi in the body by taking preventive medicine [Xiaojin Dan (\u5c0f\u91d1\u4e39) in Huangdi's Internal Classic, the first recommended formula of CM to prevent pestilence], healthy diet care, exercise and so on, so as to resist the invasion of external pathogen, and the other was to avoid the source of infection. (13) These two principles of epidemic disease prevention have been followed by CM practitioners till now. (12, 14) Since Huangdi's Internal Classic, a large number of formulae for preventing epidemic diseases have been recorded in other ancient CM classics, such as, the Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies (Zhou Hou Bei Ji Fang), Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold for Emergencies (Bei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fang), Medical Secrets of an Official (Wai Tai Mi Yao), Compendium of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Gang Mu), etc. (15) The famous doctor SUN Si-miao (541-682 AD) expounded the basis of medicines to prevent \"pestilence\" in his book Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold for Emergencies: \"pestilence comes from nature, so to prevent it, we need to fi nd medicinal herbs that also come from nature. People would not be infected if they know and take preventive medicine.\" (16) A literature study compared the characteristics of medicinal formulae for preventing pestilence in different periods of ancient China, found that during the Jin and Tang Dynasties (3rd-10th century AD), medicinal formulae were mainly used to eliminate the pathogenic factors, while Ming and Qing dynasties (14-20th century AD) focused on fortifying Spleen (Pi), resolving dampness, clearing heat, and detoxifying. (17) A l t h o u g h m a n y f o r m u l a e f o r p e s t i l e n c e prevention were recorded in ancient CM books, the case description of prevention was relatively rare. Through limited literature searches, we found an interesting case report: SU Shi (1037-1101 AD), a famous poet in the Northern Song Dynasty, accidentally found a formula for preventing pestilence named Sheng San Zi (\u5723\u6563\u5b50), a powder consisting of 22 herbs. (18) Later, when he was demoted to Huangzhou, Hubei Province, the pestilence had been outbreak for several years. He disclosed the prescription to the local people. After taking this formula, the number of patients with the disease was significantly reduced, and many lives were saved. This story was recorded by SU Shi himself, when he wrote a preface to his doctor friend PANG An-shi's book General Treatise on Febrile Diseases (Shang Han Zong Bing Lun).

It was also similar to the characteristics of CHM formulae for preventing \"pestilence\" in ancient times and SARS in 2003. (17, 19) The 6 most commonly used herbs were Astragali Radix (Huangqi), Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma (Gancao), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Forsythiae Fructus (Lianqiao). Astragali Radix (Huangqi), Saposhnikoviae Radix (Fangfeng), and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu) are all ingredients of a classical herbal formula Yupingfeng Powder, for tonifying qi to protect from external pathogens. In Lao, et al's controlled study (19) of CM formula for preventing SARS, Yupingfeng Powder was also the main ingredients. Some studies have confirmed that Yupingfeng Powder has antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. (27, 28) Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua) and Forsythiae Fructus (Lianqiao) are the core components of Yinqiao Powder, which is a classical formula used to prevent and treat respiratory infectious diseases in ancient. (29) An experimental study found that the effect of Yinqiao Powder (\u94f6\u7fd8 \u6563) in preventing and treating upper respiratory tract infection could be explained by its antibacterial and antiviral properties and improvement of the function of upper respiratory mucosal immune system. (30) A multicenter, large-scale, randomized trial found that Yinqiao Powder plus another heat-clearing formula could reduce time to fever resolution in patients with the H1N1 infl uenza virus infection. (29) At present, the National Health Commission of China has not issued a CM prevention program for COVID-19. The reasons may be, first, according to the CM theory of three-factors concerned treatment (Sanyin Zhiyi, \u4e09\u56e0\u5236\u5b9c), due to the differences of individual, regional, and seasonal factors in the occurrence and distribution of diseases, these factors should be considered in prevention and treatment, (31, 32) and second, lack of solid evidence of CM formula for COVID-19. By comparing and analyzing the prevention programs issued by provincial levels, we also found that there was slight regional difference in the recommended herbal formulae and prescription principles. For example, due to the dry climate in northern China, there are additional one or two herbs for nourishing yin in the formula, like Glehniae Radix (Shashen) and Ophiopogonis Radix (Maidong), while in the south, due to the humid climate, aromatic herbs with the function of resolving dampness and turbidity are used in the formulae, like Pogostemonis Herba (Huoxiang) and Eupatorii Herba (Peilan).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 438, "end": 442, "text": "(17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 443, "end": 446, "text": "19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 964, "end": 968, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1171, "text": "(27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1172, "end": 1175, "text": "28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1383, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1655, "end": 1659, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1862, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2262, "end": 2266, "text": "(31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2270, "text": "32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Individual difference was also considered in the prevention programs in some provinces.
