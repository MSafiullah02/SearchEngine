            "text": "Endogenous IL-12 production is hypothesized to play an essential role preventing spontaneous expression of type 2 responses, acting as a natural inhibitor limiting development of immediate hypersensitivity. Here, IL-12-deficient p35 -/and p40 -/mice were used to examine the role of endogenous IL-12 and p40 homodimer during in vivo development of exogenous antigen-driven responses. In the absence of deliberate immunization, IL-12-deficient mice exhibited greatly reduced serum IgG2a but IgG1/IgE levels no higher than controls. Immunization to elicit polarized ovalbumin-specific type 1 or type 2 dominant responses, or using Trichinella spiralis extract in the absence of adjuvants, led to IFN-+ production of approximately 10 % of C57BL/6 controls yet the kinetics and intensity of primary and secondary type 2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and antibody (IgG1, IgE) responses, as well as functional IL-12 receptor expression, were consistently unaltered. Thus, while IL-12 provides an important positive signal for Th1 development, antigen exposure in its absence does not lead to generalized enhancement of type 2 cytokine or antibody responses. The data argue that endogenous IL-12 production is not required as a constitutive negative regulator limiting induction or expression of type 2 effector responses.",

While many factors affect initial T cell differentiation and commitment, studies over the last several years have focussed attention on the central roles that IL-4 and IL-12 play in this process [1] [2] [3] . Given the activity of IL-4 as a promoter of Th2-like commitment and the negative consequences that result from excessive production of type 2 cytokines, the induction and expression of this cytokine is very tightly controlled. The discovery that IL-4 production by CD4 T cells becomes independent of extracellular cytokines following commitment to the Th2-like phenotype [4], a situation quite distinct from IFN-+ synthesis [5] , underlines the necessity of restricting initial T cell commitment to type 2 patterns.",

This capacity of IL-12 to inhibit undesirable Th2 development may function both indirectly via induction of NK and Th1 cell-derived IFN-+ production and directly by inhibitory activities on Th2 cells [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

Individuals with atopic dermatitis [13, 14] , asthma [15, 16] or allergic rhinitis [16, 17] , the most common form of atopy, are reported to exhibit substantially reduced IL-12 synthesis and/or responsiveness relative to non-atopic controls, a finding consistent with a potential role for such defects in the pathogenesis of allergic disease. In vivo studies in mice using anti-IL-12 Ab or with strains genetically deficient in Fig. 1 . IFN-+ production in response to OVA immunization is markedly reduced in IL-12 -/mice. B6 (WT), p35 -/-(p35 KO) and p40 -/-(p40 KO) mice were immunized with 2 ? g OVA in alum and killed 5 days later. Spleen cells were cultured in medium alone ( \u00df ), with OVA ( | ) or with OVA and anti-CD4 mAb YTS191.1 ( L ). Supernatants were harvested at 48 h and analyzed for IFN-+ . Means \u00b1 SEM (n = 20 mice from five independent experiments) are shown. Significant differences relative to B6 are shown (ANOVA p X 0.005**). the capacity to produce IL-12 clearly indicate a critical role for endogenous IL-12 in promoting induction of Th1 responses [6] . These data have reasonably been taken to suggest that endogenous IL-12 synthesis is also responsible for preventing development of type 2 responses [6, 11, [18] [19] [20] and, by extension, acts as a natural inhibitor of immediate hypersensitivity. While some data lend support to this hypothesis, in the majority of studies where IL-12 production or function was interrupted, IL-4 (\u00b1 IL-10) was used as the sole representative of type 2 cytokine synthesis or type 2 cytokine synthesis was not examined at all [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Indeed, experimental conditions that yield only very low to undetectable IL-4 levels in wild-type controls have frequently been used [18, 21, 24, 27, 28, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

As indicated in Figs. 4 and 5 (days 0 time point), prior to immunization the mean total serum IgG2a in the 41 mice examined for each strain was approximately 90 % lower in p40 -/-(78 vs. 8.2 ? g/ ml) and approximately 50 % lower in p35 -/mice (78 vs. 40 ? g/ml in B6 vs. p35 -/-).

In many studies, IL-4 and/or IgE production was not examined or was not shown. In others, the immunization methods selected were such that IL-4 responses in wildtype controls were at or below the detection limits of the assays used. Comparison of IL-4 production under such conditions can indicate several fold increases as a result of extremely small denominators rather than due to substantive IL-4 production. It is well established that the optimal conditions for Ag-driven activation of IL-4 and IgE production in vivo differ from those that stimulate Th0 or Th1-like responses [36] .

Anguita et al. [30] found that administration of anti-IL-12 Ab to C3H mice over the course of lyme borreliosis infection greatly reduced type 1 activation but failed to enhance either IL-4 or serum IgE. Similarly, Engwerda et al. [46] observed no increase in IL-4 following anti-IL-12 treatment of Leishmania donovani-infected BALB/c mice. While one might argue that these represent exceptions, reflecting incomplete neutralization of endogenous IL-12 synthesis in vivo, two recent studies examining the impact of mycobacterial infection in IL-12 -/models found that IL-4 responses were not enhanced in the absence of endogenous IL-12 production [32, 35] . Other representative type 2 cytokines, or IgE vs. IgG2a effector responses, were not examined in these studies. Schijns et al. [34] report that there was minimal changed in IL-4 responses (IL-5, -10, -13 not examined) following infection of IL-12-deficient mice with a hepatotropic coronavirus (an RNA virus) or a neurotropic pseudorabies virus (DNA virus). Taken together, the data suggest that a wide variety of Ag, capable of stimulating type 1-or type 2-dominated responses by endogenous or exogenous pathways, do not elicit hyperexpression of type 2 responses in the absence of IL-12 production.",

Functionally, while p40-deficient mice are highly susceptible to Listeria or Cryptococcus neoformans infection, p35deficient mice can respond to infection by sterile elimination of the bacteria despite their inability to produce p70 [6] . Moreover, in a model of alloreactive Th1 development, p35 -/mice exhibited substantially stronger IFN-+ synthesis than did p40 -/mice as a result of (p40) 2dependent promotion of CD8 type 1 commitment [11, 24] . However, we found that OVA-driven responses were consistently indistinguishable between mice lacking p35 (hence p70) or p40 (thus both p70 and p40 homodimer) when comparing either the levels of IFN-+ synthesis or the intensity of type 2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) responses under both type 1-and type 2-dominant conditions. The similarity of p35 -/and p40 -/mice was also apparent in serum Ab responses.

Similarly, while reductions in total and specific IgG2a levels were clear in IL-12-deficient mice, the residual responses were significant. These mice clearly mount substantial Ag-specific primary and secondary IgG2a responses (Figs. 5, 6) . Collectively, these data suggest that IL-12 plays an important but nonessential role in development of type 1 cytokine and Ab responses. While the role of IL-12-independent pathways in inducing type 1 immune responses remains to be fully determined, we note that Takeda et al. [47] demonstrate more intense reductions in type 1 responses in IL-12 -/-IL18 -/mice than are seen in mice deficient in IL-12 or IL-18 alone. While IL-18 does not itself directly drive Th1 development, instead synergizing with IL-12 in acting on primed Th1-like cells, the finding that functional deletion of IL-18 from IL-12-deficient mice had additional effects on type 1 commitment suggests that the Th1 response can be initiated by IL-18 independently of IL-12.

In light of the fact that IL-12 production is absent and IFN-+ reduced by approximately 90 % in this model, it suggests that the main checkpoints for control of IL-4 and type 2 responses may be primarily intrinsic (i. e. based on upregulation of IL-4 signaling that secondarily induces extinction of IL-12 signaling [48] ) rather than extrinsic ones that are dependent upon constitutive, inhibitory type 1 (IL-12 \u00b1 IFN-+ ) cytokine synthesis.

Spleen cells from mice injected with T. spiralis sonicate were cultured in the presence of medium, 20 or 100 ? g/ml Ag. In some experiments, immobilized anti-CD3 (2C11) or Con A (2 ? g/ml) were used as stimuli. Purified anti-CD4 mAb from YTS 191.1 tissue culture supernatant or normal rat IgG, rIL-12 (100 ? g/ml) and/or IL-2 (10 U/ml) were added to some cultures (see results). In most experiments mice were killed 5 days after immunization, the time of peak Ag-driven cytokine synthesis. Culture supernatants were harvested for analysis of IL-4 (24 h), IFN-+ (48 h), IL-5, IL-13 (72 h) and IL-10 (96 h), times corresponding to maximum cytokine levels. For each experiment, two to four mice/group/time point were killed, independently cultured in duplicate and analyzed.",

IL-5 (Phar-Mingen) and IL-13 (R&D Systems) were similarly assessed using cytokine-specific mAb. IFN-+ and IL-10 were determined in ELISA as previously described [51] . Detection limits for these assays were 0.15 U/ml for IFN-+ , 0.2 U/ml for IL-4, 10 pg/ml for IL-5, 0.3 U/ml for IL-10 and 5 pg/ml for IL-13. All samples were evaluated in at least two assays, with the concentration of each sample calculated from a minimum of three points that fell on the linear portion of titration curves established with recombinant cytokine standards serially diluted on each plate. Inter-assay standard errors ranged from 5 % to 10 % in most cases.",
