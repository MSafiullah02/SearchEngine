Age band (15-51, 51-64, 64-75, 75 -100 years, grouped by the quartiles of the baseline age distribution among those who had an event during the follow-up) was adjusted for as a time-varying categorical covariate.

This was because we relied on hospital diagnoses, and patients with viral respiratory infections are usually admitted to hospital because of secondary bacterial infections. Since patients are rarely tested for, e.g., influenza virus, the discharge diagnosis tends to be bacterial pneumonia or other bacterial respiratory infection despite a primary viral infection. This is echoed by the dramatic decrease of number of events (97%) when we limited the analysis to explicit viral respiratory infections in a posthoc analysis. This radically lowered statistical power and the posthoc analysis did not yield any significant results.
