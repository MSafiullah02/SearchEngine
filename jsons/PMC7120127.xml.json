Patient and graft outcomes are closely monitored on a national level and 1-year survival is between 80 and 92 % (http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/latestData/rptStrat.asp accessed 10/19/13). Perhaps more than with any other surgical program, graft and patient outcomes for liver transplantation reflect the combined efforts of several interrelated services. The success stems from a multidisciplinary approach with close involvement of gastroenterologists, anesthesiologists, surgeons, and intensivists. This chapter will review the concerns related to postoperative care of the liver transplant patient in the intensive care unit. Existing evidence on potential early concerns such as hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory failure, neurologic management, electrolyte and glucose correction, coagulation management, systemic immunosuppression, graft function and rejection, and technical problems will be reviewed. The chapter will conclude with brief mention of long-term complications related to recurrence of disease that may lead to future ICU admissions.",

Hemodynamic monitoring for liver transplantation should include arterial and central venous catheters at a minimum.

The type of monitoring differs among transplant centers and is determined by individual or institutional practice. For example, Schumann et al. surveyed 62 transplant centers in the United States and found that PACs were used in 30 % and transesophageal echocardiography was used in 11.3 % during the intra-operative period [3].",

            "text": "Due to limitations of central venous and pulmonary artery catheters, the use of dynamic methods of fluid responsiveness is currently being explored. Presumably dynamic measurements based on physiologic responses will be more accurate than static indicators [7]. The measurements, including systolic pressure variations (SPV) and pulse pressure variations (PPV), are derived from algorithms that abstract data from an arterial line and allow beat-to-beat monitoring for the purpose of predicting fluid responsiveness. Although the data are promising under anesthesia [8, 9], these monitors have not been validated in the ICU. Furthermore, in order to obtain accurate calculations, patients must be in sinus rhythm, have a closed chest, have normal intra-abdominal pressures, and be on controlled ventilation with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0\u20135 cm H2O [10]. Perhaps the most prudent approach from all this data is to base management on clinical examination findings and appropriately titrate fluid according to the patient\u2019s hemodynamic trends. The preferred choice of monitoring tool (central venous line, PAC, or echocardiography) remains controversial due to the lack of evidence indicating a difference in patient outcomes. Overall choice of monitoring for cardiac function and fluid status is probably best decided based on the expertise of the center and the familiarity and ease of access to different options.",

Diagnostic criteria vary, but it is important to note that pulmonary pressures should be verified with right heart catheterization pre-transplant if suspicion for pulmonary hypertension arises on echocardiography [11]. Prevalence of portopulmonary syndrome in liver transplant is approximately 6 % as found in a prospective study evaluating 165 patients [12]. Due to the effect on postoperative mortality, most patients with portopulmonary hypertension will have been identified in the preoperative setting; this information is vital to the physician caring for the patient postoperatively. Of particular importance are both the severity of disease and treatments the patient received prior to transplant. Disease severity is a predictor of postoperative mortality. Severe portopulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 45 mmHg) is associated with a perioperative mortality of 40 % [13]. Mild pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure < 35 mmHg) is not associated with decreased survival and current case series suggest that if pulmonary pressures can be reduced medically to less than 35 mmHg, then outcomes are acceptable [14].",

Early extubation has been shown to decrease ICU length of stay and resource utilization [19]. In some centers, early extubation is performed in as many as 70\u201380 % of cases [20].

Glanemann and colleagues demonstrated that patients that were extubated immediately following surgery actually had a lower rate of reintubation when compared with patients who were extubated on average 5 h postoperatively, or those requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation of more than 24 h [22]. In a multicenter trial conducted to evaluate the safety of early extubation [23], extubation rates varied from 5 to 67 % despite a uniform set of extubation criteria. The authors concluded that there were likely institutional-specific practices that were not measured or controlled by the study.

Severe hyperglycemia (glucose > 200 mg/dL) is associated with an increased risk of liver allograft rejection [50], surgical site infection [51], and increased mortality [52]. Hyperglycemia is known to aggravate ischemia reperfusion injury in several organ systems.",

Using a reduced dose of cyclosporine, or replacing cyclosporine with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and sirolimus reduces the incidence of CNI-induced renal injury [64]. While CNI-induced nephropathy was reduced with MMF and sirolimus, the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection in the liver increased. Fortunately, this was not associated with increased rates of graft loss. A recently conducted Cochrane review of the literature surrounding CNI toxicity did not reach a conclusion regarding the role of CNI minimization in preventing nephrotoxicity in liver transplant patients [65]. Many centers now delay the administration of these drugs following surgery. The dosages used today are also substantially lower than those prescribed in the past in order to reduce the subsequent risk of chronic kidney disease [56].",

There is decreased platelet production because of low thrombopoietin levels in liver failure patients [88]. In the postoperative period, massive blood transfusions can result in a dilutional thrombocytopenia. Finally, even if the platelet count is adequate, platelets in a patient with liver disease may have decreased function because of adenosine diphosphate-induced and collagen-induced aggregation [89]. Platelet function may be further impaired by uremia in the setting of coexistent renal dysfunction. Thromboelastography (TEG) may be beneficial in measuring platelet function [90], but definitive studies relating use of TEG in liver transplant patients are needed.",

GVHD is divided between acute (occurring within 100 days of transplant) and chronic (after 100 days) presentations. Risk factors associated with the development of GVHD include alcoholic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diabetes mellitus.

In the presence of lamivudine resistance, alternative antivirals such as adefovir, entecavir, or tenofovir may be considered. Monotherapy with antivirals posttransplant has not been found to be as effective in preventing the recurrence of disease. Currently, there are two strategies for discontinuing HBIG postoperatively.

Risk factors for the development of recurrence include initial lesion size, number of lesions, and age of donor. AFP level, waiting time until transplant, and use of therapy to decrease disease burden prior to transplant did not affect the rate of recurrence [144]. While most disease recurs within the first 1\u20132 years following transplant, late disease recurrence is not uncommon [149]. Surveillance methods following transplant should include serial chest and abdominal imaging for 3 years following transplant. AFP levels may be trended as well. Once disease recurrence occurs, radiofrequency ablation or lesion resections are the treatments of choice. Liver retransplantation is not recommended for recurrent HCC [150].",

Risk factorsfor the development of PTLD include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, young recipient age, cytomegalovirus (CMV) mismatch, and the use of thymoglobulin [151]. Early occurrence frequently occurs in the setting of EBV infection, while later occurrence is not associated with EBV. EBV status should be determined prior to transplantation in order to identify high-risk individuals. Patients with high viral loads should be considered for early preemptive therapy, including the use of antivirals or monoclonal B cell antibodies. The signs of PTLD development include lymphadenopathy, microcytic anemia, electrolyte disturbances, and abnormal liver or kidney function. The diagnosis relies on histopathology. Once PTLD has been diagnosed, a reduction or cessation of immunosuppression should be considered [151]. The anti CD20 antibody rituximab, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical debulking are effective in the treatment of PTLD [152, 153]. Though not often seen in the ICU, some of these patients may be admitted due to complications from tumor growth or chemotherapy.",
