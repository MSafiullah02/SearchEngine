            "text": "Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is often triggered by bacterial or viral infection of the airways.1, 2, 3, 4 Bacteria have been implicated in the development of AECOPD but the pathophysiology of this relationship is not fully understood. It is believed that colonization promotes inflammatory response and subsequent airway obstruction, or that infection may directly contribute to the development of AECOPD. Bacteria are isolated in 40\u201360% of AECOPD.5 However, 20\u201340% of patients with stable COPD have positive sputum cultures, suggesting that bacteria may sometimes be an innocent bystander, rather than the actual cause of AECOPD.6 In addition to bacteria, recent studies using sensitive nucleic acid detection methods have shown that respiratory viruses may be frequent triggers of AECOPD.7 Viral infections are believed to be responsible for the same proportion of AECOPD8 than bacterial infections.6 Viral infections have also been detected in stable COPD patients, suggesting that viruses may cause persistent low-grade infection that could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.9 While influenza appears to be the most frequently detected virus in that condition, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is also a leading cause of virus-induced exacerbation.2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12 As infected adults shed little virus compared to children, it is only with the advent of sensitive molecular assays capable of detecting few viral copies that the role of RSV in community-acquired adult lower respiratory tract infections has become more frequently recognized.13, 14, 15\n",

In our sample, 31% of patients admitted for AECOPD had evidence of respiratory viral infections, which supports the idea of their importance in AECOPD. This result is slightly higher than those previously reported in studies relying on culture or serology for identification of respiratory pathogens.18 It is, however, in agreement with most reports using nucleic acid detection methods such as RT-PCR.19, 20, 21, 22 While the observed prevalence of viral respiratory infections in AECOPD patients is similar to what has been previously reported, the distribution of types of respiratory viruses is different. Influenza and RSV were the most frequently found viruses, and almost equal contributors to AECOPD. While these results are in line with previous studies, we found rhinoviruses in only 4 cases (9% of all viral exacerbations) which is much less than previously observed. Reasons for our lower detection rate for rhinoviruses may include the low sensitivity of our multiplex RT-PCR assay for these pathogens (1000 copies), a different epidemiological season, and a more selected population (88% of patients were hospitalized).",

This proportion is consistent with other reports and explains why clinical trials found antibiotics to clinically improve patients with AECOPD.23 The most frequently identified pathogen was S. aureus (15%), and P. aeruginosa (11%). Soler et al., found that more severe COPD cases infected with influenza and RSV were also coinfected by bacterial pathogens.1 We did not find a higher frequency of mixed infections in patients with severe disease but this may reflect the small number of patients with severe COPD and influenza or RSV infection in our study. Bacterial analysis of sputum was only conducted on patients who were able to submit an adequate sample (67%). The failure rate in obtaining a valid sputum sample that we have observed in this study is consistent with what has been reported in the litterature.24 Because patients with sputum samples were not more likely to have a viral infection or to have a more severe disease, we believe that our results were not affected even if sputum cultures were not available from all patients.",
