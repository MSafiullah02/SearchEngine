            "text": "Protection against infectious diseases such as influenza virus is a sought-after goal, which may be more attainable if also addressed from a viewpoint of diagnostic performance. For example, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infections in humans, such as the H5N1 subtype, have been identified as emerging infectious diseases with a high mortality rate compared with human influenza viruses (Peiris et al., 2007, Subbarao et al., 1998, Yuen et al., 1998). There are two main infection mechanisms. One mechanism is the expression of avian influenza receptors in human cells such as type II pneumocytes, which promotes infection with the predominantly avian-restricted H5N1 subtype (Kogure et al., 2006, Yao et al., 2008). The other is mutation of HA, which results in the ability to bind to human SA (Neu5Ac\u03b1(2-6)Gal). It has been reported that mutations in several key amino acids in the antigenic epitope of HA create an interphyletic type of HA that can bind both avian SA (Neu5Ac\u03b1(2-3)Gal) and human SA moieties (Sawada et al., 2010, Yamada et al., 2006). This genetic drift can lead to species jump and human-to-human transmission in a previously avian-restricted virus, and may ultimately cause a serious influenza pandemic. For example, despite preferentially binding to avian SA, such rapid mutation of the HA gene has resulted in subtypes H7N7 and H9N2 being capable of binding to the human form, albeit frequently with reduced efficacy, and thus represent emerging pandemic threats. Therefore, the ability to rapidly detect the host restriction of emerging viruses with high sensitivity may enhance surveillance and indicate imminent species jump events.",

However, antigenic drift poses a problem to the recognition of HA (Carrat and Flahault, 2007), which may cause serious false negative results because of the escape from specific binding. On the other hand, human SA and avian SA are essential for infection with human and avian influenza viruses, respectively, and therefore represent suitable moieties to identify the subtype of virus (Watanabe et al., 2015). However, the detection sensitivity of conventional rapid assays such as ICT is over 5 hemagglutinating units (HAU) (Watanabe et al., 2015, Yeo et al., 2014), which occasionally leads to false negative results in the early stage of infection. If the sensitivity of diagnostic techniques could be improved using SA receptors, it may help prevent the occurrence of a serious influenza pandemic.",

In addition, biosensing systems using electrical detection, such as field effect transistors (FETs) have also attracted attention as label-free biosensors (Goda and Miyahara, 2010, Goda and Miyahara, 2013, Hideshima et al., 2013). In this report, the specific binding between human influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and 6SL-immobilized electrodes was first confirmed with QCM and then further confirmed using electrical detection techniques (Fig. 1B). Advantageously, the electrical detection techniques do not require optical devices or any other optional input transducers for biosensing. Therefore, the system can be miniaturized and the procedure simplified. In this report, a systematically fabricated SA receptor layer on a gold electrode for direct and label-free rapid detection of H1N1 influenza A virus was evaluated by QCM and electrical detection.",

It was revealed that the frequency change was higher on the 6SL surfaces than the 3SL surfaces (Fig. 3B). To determine the specificity of the 6SL surfaces, the average frequency changes 5 min after the injection of virus solution were plotted against each virus titer (Fig. 3C). This result showed that relative difference (specific response) was observed at 1/16 HAU, which was 80 times higher than that of ICT (5 HAU) (Watanabe et al., 2015, Yeo et al., 2014). In this study, the virus was cultivated in chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos, then chorioallantoic fluid including virus was collected. The solution was filtered using 0.45 \u00b5m membrane filter but no more purification process was performed, which means that many kinds of impurity such as proteins were entirely remained in the original virus solution. The signals of nonspecific binding shown in Fig. 3B and C may be derived from these impurities. Even though this is not real sample from patients, the virus derived from biological fluid can be detected with this technique. The techniques for suppression of non-specific adsorption such as co-immobilization of zwitterion (Goda and Miyahara, 2013, Horiguchi et al., 2014, Ostuni et al., 2001). have been reported, which would be effective for improving the signal to noise ratio.",

            "text": "Based on the results obtained with QCM measurements, electrical measurements using chemically modified electrodes were carried out to investigate the specific electrical interactions between influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and 6SL-immobilized surfaces (Fig. 3D). The real-time electrical measurements of virus detection on 6SL-modified gold electrodes showed that the potential changes (\u2206V) increased with increasing HA titer of H1N1 influenza A virus (Fig. 3E). These measurements revealed significant relative potential differences between 6SL (red) and 3SL (blue) immobilized surfaces at a concentration of 1/80 HAU (Fig. 3F). As we described in the Section 3.1, the virus solution is almost intact biological fluid. The non-specific signal derived from impurities might disturb the specific signal. In this study, the exchange of a solution was performed carefully to minimize the non-specific signal. However, manual introduction of a solution sometimes induced unusual response of the electrode as shown in Fig. 3E. As is often the case with a gold electrode, we observed a potential drift when we exchanged the solutions. To solve this problem, we approximated the drift behavior with a straight line to take away the effect of drifts (Supporting Information, Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. 3F, virus detection on 6SL and 3SL surfaces were performed twice each, and the two red lines and two blue lines showed the same tendency even though these noise signals disturb the specific signals. It would be possible to improve accuracy of detection by optimizing the baseline correction, since the observed drifts are not exactly but slightly curved. For virus detection under competitive binding inhibition conditions with 1 mM free 6SL solution (purple), the potential changes on 6SL-modified electrodes were decreased to around the same level as 3SL immobilized surfaces, as the free 6SL successfully bound and therefore blocked the binding sites of H1N1 influenza A virus. Therefore, the relative potential difference between 6SL and 3SL can be confidently attributed to specific binding of influenza A virus. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) range of lectin-carbohydrate binding is 10\u22122 to 10\u22125\n M (Lis and Sharon, 1998), which is lower than that of antibody or aptamer. However, multisite binding of lectin-carbohydrate interactions can enhance the interaction strength by multiplier effect. In this experiment, the density of immobilized sialyllactose was greater than 1.46\u00b10.33 molecules/nm2, as determined by QCM (Supporting Information, Fig. S3). Therefore, multisite binding was possible between the sensor surface and influenza virus A subtype H1N1, which is 93\u00b123 nm in diameter on average (Fig. 2B). HA makes up 25\u201330% of all influenza virus proteins (Aitken and Hannoun, 1980), and this ratio may be sufficient to form multisite bonds on the HA-dense surface of the viral envelope.",

The nanostructure on the surface of the viral particle may explain this. HA and other proteins are expressed on the virus surface as spike proteins projecting from the virus membrane. HA forms homotrimeric structures on the viral surface, with a molecular weight of around 80 kDa (Aitken and Hannoun, 1980). These spikes may have resulted in formation of a gap of more than several nanometers between the viral envelope and sensing surface when HA was bound to sialyllactose. As a result, the negatively charged viral membrane is considered to be outside the electrical double layer that suppresses the contribution of the negative charge to the potential changes. However, the human SA moiety on the SAM surface can interact strongly with the HA epitope on the virus surface. It has been reported that two basic amino acids (H183 and R229) and one acidic amino acid (E190) were close to SA when HA was bound to the SA immobilized surfaces (Sawada et al., 2010). It has also been reported that the potentials showed a positive shift when free HA was bound to human SA surfaces (Hideshima et al., 2013). According to these considerations, the positively charged epitope area of HA is considered to contribute to the positive potential response.",

To understand the sensing performance more clearly on a physical scale, binding assays using commercially available recombinant HAs were carried out. In these experiments, the HA solutions derived from H1N1 (A/California/04/2009) or H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) were applied to the 6SL immobilized gold surface (\nFig. 4A) and a significant difference of relative potentials between the two subtypes of HAs was observed from subnanomolar concentrations of the HA solutions (Fig. 4B). However, HA forms homotrimers (Wiley and Skehel, 1987) that can increase the affinity strength by multisite binding. It has been reported that the result of the KD between recombinant HA derived from influenza A virus subtype H5N3 (A/duck/Hong Kong/313/4/1978 (H5N3)) and GD1a (an avian SA containing structure) was 6.10\u00d710\u22129\n M according to QCM measurements (Takahashi et al., 2013a). Based on these factors, the relative difference observed was of the subnanomolar order. In this study, specific recognition was performed using human influenza virus only. However, selective binding between human influenza HA and avian influenza HA was confirmed. According to the previous report (Watanabe et al., 2015), it has already been demonstrated that each sialic acid receptor can distinguish each influenza virus using ICT test. On the basis of these results, we concluded that selective detection of human or avian influenza could be realize using chemically modified electrodes to improve the diagnostic performance.",

            "text": "In the previous section, the sensing performance of virus binding assay was discussed. To understand the similarities, differences and advantages between the proposed detection system and existing methods, a comparison table was shown in\nTable 1. The important points for comparison are sensitivity in terms of required virus titer, detection time and cost. In our method, the specific response was observed at 1/16 HAU by QCM measurement (Fig. 3C). In the case of electrical measurement, the specific response was observed at 1/80 HAU (Fig. 3F). The total exposures in the virus solution are (1/32 HAU for 5 min)+(1/16 HAU for 5 min) for QCM measurement, and (1/1280 HAU for 10 min)+(1/320 HAU for 10 min)+(1/80 HAU for 10 min) for electrical measurement. According to these result, 1/16 HAU virus can be detected in 10 min with QCM, and at least 1/80 HAU can be detected in 30 min with the electrical measurement. In the Table 1, these values were defined as sensitivity in terms of required virus titer and detection time for comparison. ICT is widely used because it takes short time to diagnose from the sampling from patients. On the other hand, real-time PCR technique can detect the trace amount of virus precisely. According to the previous report (Takahashi et al., 2013b), detection of virus HA gene with real-time reverse-transcription-PCR showed high sensitivity compared with traditional solid-phase virus binding assay, TLC virus overlay assay and ICT (Table 1). However, gene detection methods need much time (several hours) compared with ICT because extraction of gene from virus and amplification process for the detection are required. If we use the virus detection in medical facilities such as a hospital and a physician's office, a result is desirable to be obtained before a patient leave for home. In the case of our method, the lower concentration of virus solution can be detected with both QCM and electrical measurements compared with existing techniques. However, a cost of QCM sensor chip was 4000 JPY (approximately 35 USD), which was almost four times higher than that of ICT. On the other hand, the cost of electrical detection system will be much lower than that of ICT. As shown in Fig. 1B, the sensor chip can be removable from the device and the price of this unit is 100 JPY (less than 1 USD). The total cost including the modification process of sialyllactose will be less than 2 USD. If the chips were mass-produced in an industrial production line, the price will become lower. Even though the initial cost for the electrical device is required, the cost of the sensor chip is reasonable range for diagnosis. In this study, we took sufficient time for the detection of virus because of the stabilization of electrode potential. However, as described earlier, it is possible to shorten the detection time if the optimum approximation scheme is adopted for the baseline correction.",

The identification technique for the subtype of influenza A virus may be able to help reduce the risk of pandemic outbreaks of HPAI in future. Many kinds of viruses such as coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus and dengue virus have specific binding sites for oligosaccharide receptors. These viruses can also be measured using the same method described in this report. That is, the multi-sensing system using a high-density array of oligosaccharide probes can be developed for highly sensitive and label-free multiple virus tests in the future.",
