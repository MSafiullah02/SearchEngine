That false dichotomy has long since passed as infectious disease has become a central issue in biological conservation, which itself has become enmeshed in an inter-disciplinary web that embraces the health of ecosystems and people (e.g. Riordan et al., 2006). Indeed, these issues are set to become more entwined, as globalisation, climate change, human population expansion and the natural and unnatural movements of species interact to catapult emergent and mobile diseases to prominence beyond either the public health or conservation agendas, to land firmly on the global political table. Infectious diseases have passed in both directions between people and wildlife since time immemorial, but today the enormous rise in human populations, their penetration to every corner of wilderness with concomitant land-use changes, and their transportation of organisms around the world creates an explosive mix of risks.",

            "text": "Is infectious disease generally a matter for concern by conservation biologists? One general answer might be that infectious diseases are hazards to ecosystems when they affect keystone species such as top predators, or when they undermine ecosystem support systems (Foresight, 2006). However, infectious disease is a natural phenomenon, and a general tenet of biological conservation might be not to meddle where natural processes operate naturally. Compassion might prompt the rescue, or even euthanasia, of a sick animal, but such an intervention could be said to have little relevance to conservation, much of which is focused on the viability of populations and ecological communities. Of course, even before since it was formalised in the models of Anderson and May (1978), ecologists have realised not only that parasites (in the widest sense of pathogens) were not merely a source of morbidity and mortality in Nature, but could also limit, even regulate, some populations. In that sense, pathogens are clearly relevant to conservation biologists, as part of natural processes, but that certainly does not qualify them as a problem, nor does it constitute a justification for meddling in population processes insofar as these processes are natural. This line of thought and it has merit, leads to the conclusion that infectious diseases may often not be of concern to conservation. It also leads sometimes to conservationists being disquieted by a too ready eagerness to intervene when disease afflicts wildlife. On the other hand, there are clear and pressing cases where infectious disease in wildlife conspicuously affects, or is affected or caused by, humans, and human involvement is an operational definition of topics within the ambit of conservation (Cleaveland et al., 2002). So, as is characteristic of conservation issues, the decision of when an infectious disease justifies intervention is not always straightforward, and indeed the position of infectious disease within conservation is both technically and philosophically challenging. It was discussions of such topics that prompted us to convene a conference to explore the diverse ways in which infectious disease threaded through issues in mammalian conservation.",

Nonetheless, it was catalysed by a two-day event held on 21st\u201322nd May 2005: The Mammals Trust UK\u2019s International Conference on Wild Mammals and Disease, and the ensuing Think Tank hosted at Tubney House by Oxford University\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. From these events grew the papers that comprise this volume. Our starting point was that infectious diseases can have profoundly damaging consequences for mammal populations, particularly those that are already small or isolated. Some of the diseases affecting wildlife also pose potential threats to human health. Of 1415 known pathogens that have infected humans historically, 62% had zoonotic origin (Taylor et al., 2001). Furthermore, emergence of human pathogens is associated with the ability to infect wildlife for bacteria, fungi and viruses (Cleaveland et al., 2001). It is estimated that 75% of all diseases emerging over the last two decades have been zoonoses; these include SARS, avian influenza, Ebola, monkey pox, and the West Nile Virus (Brown, 1999, Hart et al., 1999).",

            "text": "A brief scan of the major issues in conservation biology worldwide reveals infectious disease as a recurrent linking thread between them. For example, alien species bring with them a host of other, less obvious, creatures that can cause disease: ticks and fleas, intestinal worms and protozoans, viruses and bacteria. In Britain, an obvious case is the grey squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis; more than half a century of research and puzzlement passed before the breakthrough that their impact on native red squirrels, Sciurus vulgaris, was mediated by a virus. Habitat loss and modification, the most important issue for biodiversity conservation, which is also due to the expansion of human populations and activities, has widespread ramifications for infectious disease transmission to and from wildlife. Worldwide, the expansion, both in range and density, of domestic dogs and cat populations with their human masters has led to an apparent increase in incidence of outbreaks in wild carnivores, particularly canids (Woodroffe et al., 2004). For example, rabies spread by dogs threatens canids around the world, including highly endangered Ethiopian wolves, Canis simensis, and African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus (Laurenson et al., 2004). The few recent isolated cases of rabies transmitted to humans by Daubenton\u2019s bats, M. daubentonii, have given a new impetus to studies of the prevalence of this group of viruses in bat populations in the UK and its implications for human health (Harris et al., 2006).",

However, not all populations of introduced grey squirrels carry the virus \u2013 those in Scotland and Italy do not \u2013 but the rate of red squirrel replacement by grey squirrels is some twenty times faster in those areas where grey squirrels carry the virus.

DFTD is a cancerous disease found exclusively in wild devil populations, and Hawkins et al. report that it is consistently fatal to afflicted individuals. The tumours were first reported in 1996 and have subsequently been histologically confirmed in individuals from 41 separate sites, covering 51% of Tasmania (with a maximum of 83% of individuals infected).

Reservoir identification can aid disease management, ensuring that the correct host is targeted with appropriate and effective disease control tools. When disease control measures in wild species of conservation concern are difficult to implement, due to complicated logistics or limited finances, identification of a reservoir domestic host may offer potential control measures that might be both effective and feasible. The importance of reservoir identification is classically illustrated by a range of papers in this Special Issue, for example the ongoing dilemma facing bovine tuberculosis control (Macdonald et al., 2006, Macdonald et al., 2006), the diseases emerging from bats (Breed et al., 2006), phocine distemper virus (PDV) in northern seal population (Hall et al., 2006) and the canid pathogens threatening Island foxes (Clifford et al., 2006).",

This paper highlights the role of bats as reservoirs of these and other emerging diseases. Behavioural and physiological characteristics of species such as the fruit bats, including the ability to cover long distances between islands and continents, close association at roosts and their mammalian physiology, ensure a large effective population size for pathogen persistence and adaptation. Identification of fruit bats as reservoirs for Henipaviruses means that control can be directed at minimising their contact with domestic species.",

Both outbreaks were detected on the Danish Island of Anholt, the first in 1988 and the second in 2002. Harbour seals were highly susceptible to infection while sympatric grey seals are more resistant. In this phocid community the most likely reservoir of the virus are Arctic species of seals, but grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, could be important asymptomatic carriers that link these reservoir hosts to the harbour seal populations further south. Hall et al. emphasise that understanding of the determinants of the host range remains poor, and that development of more realistic epidemiological models should be combined with studies into the factors controlling species and individual susceptibility.

Assuming that greys will not settle within Kielder because of the unfavourable nature of the spruce habitat, the authors predict that SQPV disease will burn out at the edges of the forest, although many red squirrels will die. This burn-out is unlikely to be the scenario in other refuge areas where the habitat is more favourable to greys.

A variety of reviews have highlighted the situations and risk factors for emergence in human and domestic animals populations (Morse, 2004, Taylor et al., 2001, Cleaveland et al., 2001). The expansion of human populations is paramount, influencing agricultural development, urbanisation, deforestation and habitat fragmentation. This in turn influences disease emergence by changing the densities and ecology of disease hosts vectors and pathogens, and altering human interaction with them (McMichael, 2004). For example, the penetration of remote forest areas through logging or bushmeat hunting is rapidly escalating the contacts between people and primates (Zommers and Macdonald, 2006). Not only does this have important implications for direct persecution through the harvest of bushmeat, but it also raises sinister opportunities for disease transmission as described by Leendertz et al. (2006). They describe recent outbreaks of disease in great apes, including Ebola, and indications of cross-transmission of Ebola and other viruses between primates and humans.

Similar epidemics subsequently occurred in other regions of Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America, suggesting that the virus had dispersed widely following its emergence in China. However, Forrester et al. (2006) report that RHDV had circulated apparently harmlessly for many years before the first recognised epidemic in China. They have therefore studied the evolution, emergence and dispersal of this virus in relation to its impact on conservation of wildlife species. Using phylogenetic analysis they show that the Chinese epidemic virus represents a relatively recent lineage derived from more divergent European viruses that circulated for many years prior to 1984. They show that the genetic lineages of the pathogenic viruses that emerged in the UK in the early 1990s, are distinct from and pre-date those of the 1984 Chinese virus. In short, several other divergent pathogenic European strains of RHDV emerged from apparently harmless strains to cause epidemic outbreaks, independently of the Chinese 1984 epidemic virus. Forrester et al. also illustrate the complexity of conservation issues surrounding the rabbit in the UK \u2013 originally an invasive species, now an agricultural pest, yet a source of food for rare native predators and an important tool for habitat conservation.",

Nipah virus has caused a major outbreak of disease in pigs and humans in Malaysia the late 1990s and has also caused human mortalities in Bangladesh annually since 2001.

            "text": "Animal behaviour, as the central factor, more often than not, in determining transmission of infectious disease between infected and susceptible individuals, is unquestionably important in wildlife epidemiology and conservation. This point was originally made in the context of failing attempts to control rabies in European red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, which largely ignored their behavioural ecology (Macdonald, 1980), and in this volume it is made stridently by Randall et al. and Vial et al., who illustrate how knowledge of, respectively, Ethiopian wolf and African wild dog social systems is important to understanding and managing the extinction threat they both face from rabies. Macdonald et al., 2006, Macdonald et al., 2006 further emphasise this in the context of attempted control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle. The worsening situation of bTB in cattle has occurred despite a succession of government schemes involving killing badgers with the intention of reducing transmission of bTB to cattle. Macdonald et al. discuss the perturbation hypothesis which postulates that killing individuals may affect the survivors in ways (behavioural, physiological, immunological) that cause a disproportionate, and perhaps counter-productive, effect. They conclude that the Perturbation Hypothesis is supported by the data and does provide one plausible mechanism to explain why culling badgers has not generally achieved control of bTB in cattle. Macdonald et al. draw on various studies to argue that to have any prospect of contributing significantly to controlling bTB in cattle, a badger cull would have to be undertaken over a very large area. Considering the likely very important role of cattle-to-cattle transmission, and the opportunities for solutions in terms of farm management and surveillance, they judge it would be inappropriate (and probably impractical) to undertake such a cull now (especially in the context of revised agricultural payments which increasingly put a premium on custody of the countryside and its biodiversity (Mathews et al., 2006a)).",

This behaviour clearly has far-reaching implications for disease transmission within and across continents, particularly for migratory species. Saiga movements, that determine the timing and scale of contacts with domestic animals, also crucially affect disease transmission and persistence. Morgan et al. (2006) explain how for both foot and mouth disease and gastrointestinal nematodes, the main risk is associated with infection of saigas from livestock, and subsequent geographical dissemination of infection through saiga migration. The chance of this occurring for foot and mouth disease is predicted to be highly dependent on saiga population size and on the time of viral introduction. For nematodes, the level of risk and predicted direction of transmission are affected by key parasite life history traits, such that prolonged off-host survival of Marshallagia in autumn enables infection of saigas and transfer northwards in spring.",

SARS, appearing in southern China in late 2002, illustrates that issues at the heart of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem health are fundamental to human well-being. SARS may have emerged in humans from SARS-like coronaviruses (CoV) in Himalayan palm civets (Paguna larvata) and other small carnivores in the wet markets of Asia. Specimens collected from animals found in live wild-game markets in Guangdong China have yielded a SARS CoV-like virus and several of the early SARS patients in Guangdong Province worked in the sale or preparation of wildlife for food (Bell et al., 2004, Peiris et al., 2004) and half of 10 civet dealers at the market were found to have antibodies that cross reacted to SARS (Bell et al., 2004). Recent research suggests that the disease may have jumped to civets from Rhinolophid bats in the marketplace, since SARS-like coronavirus has been detected in three species from China, Australia and the USA (Li et al., 2005, Lau et al., 2005). Greater genetic variation between these bat strains (as revealed by nucleocapsid protein sequences) than seen in the human or civet SARS indicates that the viruses and bats have had time to co-adapt, and hence that bats are probably the origin of SARS. Bats find themselves along with civets and people in wildlife markets, to which live mammals are brought from increasingly remote areas into contact with an increasingly large human population with global links. Bats are also important pollinators and dispersal agents, and many are endangered species and thus their conservation is a priority for the continuing function of many ecosystems. This blend of factors links the concerns of public health, agriculture, biodiversity conservation, animal welfare, third world development and global economics.",

Hunters, farmers, market vendors and consumers experience direct risk of zoonotic disease transmission from bushmeat and animals (Karesh et al., 2005). However, human to human transmission then spreads the risk to other individuals around the world and can turn a local outbreak into a global crisis. The local SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and Southern China, quickly spread to 25 countries across five continents, through human air travel (Peiris et al., 2004). The fact that over 700 million people travel by air annually (Karesh et al., 2005) means that the risk of global epidemics has never been higher and is the factor that could accelerate the spread of a global flu pandemic, ahead of vaccine production, should the mutations for human\u2013human transmission occur.",

This report brought together diverse experts to consider the threats from disease for wildlife and for humans. Their conclusions emphasise the pressing nature of the issue, not least because of advancing climate change which may affect host and vector abundance and distribution and thus contact networks and transmission rates, but also because of the huge costs of disease outbreaks that affect human or livestock health. For example, BSE in the United Kingdom in 1996\u20131997 is estimated to have cost \u00a32.3 billion whereas avian influenza in Vietnam in 2003/2004 is costed at \u00a30.32 billion (Foresight, 2006).

One Delphic circle of the wise recently identified the following priority areas (Foresight, 2006) for investment (i) novel information technology for capture, analysis and modelling of data for the early detection of infectious diseases, (ii) early detection and characterisation of new or newly resistant/virulent pathogens using genomics, (iii) improving technology for the rapid identification and characterisation of infectious diseases in the field and (iv) high-throughput screening for infectious diseases of people, animals and plants using surrogate, non-invasive markers in airports, sea/road containers and livestock markets. Others could add to this list. For example, this, and all other branches of conservation biology, must urgently develop inter-disciplinary syntheses, must achieve alignment with other major guests around the table of environment, sustainability and development, and must not forget the underpinning importance of a deep understanding of natural history (Macdonald et al., 2006, Macdonald et al., 2006).",
