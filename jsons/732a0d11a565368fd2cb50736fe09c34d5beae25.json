TUNEL assays and electron microscopy reveal that brain parenchymal cells such as neurons, astrocytes, microglia/macrophages and oligodendrocytes are undergoing apoptosis during acute and chronic infection with a neurotropic strain MHV-A59. Although apoptosis is a normal phenomenon in helping the turnover of inflammatory cells, apoptosis of brain parenchymal cells may have significant implications for the pathogenesis of viral-induced demyelination.",

It serves as an experimental model for multiple sclerosis (MS). A closely related strain (MHV-2) causes acute hepatitis and meningitis without encephalitis or demyelination. The pathogenesis of MHV-induced demyelination in mice is not completely understood and a potential mechanism of apoptosis was suggested. Previous studies showed apoptotic T cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in demyelinating areas following infection with JHM, another neurotropic-demyelinating strain of MHV (Barac-Latas et al 1997) .",

Mice were injected intracerebrally (I.C.) with 2.5x103, 25 and 5 PFU of MHV-A59, 25 and 5 PFU of MHV-2. B6MRL-Fas-lpr mice were injected I.C. with 25 and 5 PFU of MHV-A59. Mock-infected mice were injected I.C. with L2 cell lysate. Mice were sacrificed on days 1,3,5,7,9,11,and 30 (2-3 mice per time point per virus, during the acute stage and 52 mice on day 30). Brain, spinal cord and liver were removed and placed in 10% normal buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Five gm thick sections were stained with LFB and H&E. Detection of in situ DNA fragmentation was done with fluorescein in situ cell death detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Indiana) as specified by the manufacturer. Double labeling for TUNEL with viral antigen, and TUNEL with specific markers for astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and macrophages was performed by immunohistochemistry. The analysis was performed by the avidin-biotinphosphatase based technique (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) using fast-red or vector blue (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as a staining substrate and a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-MHV-A59 polyclonal antibody, 1:100 dilution of monoclonal glial fibrillary acidic protein (Lee et al. 1984) , 1:500 carbonic anhydrase II (Cammer et al 1985) or 1:50 rat anti mouse F4/80 antigen (Serotec Inc., Raleigh, NC), respectively.",

This treatment has been previously shown to be effective in the treatment of apoptosis in EAE and also reduce the amount of demyelination. The treatment was given continuously at a dose of 1 mg per day, at a delivery rate of lmicroliter per hour, for 30 days, beginning 1 day prior to the infection with the virus. While encephalitis was not different between the treated and untreated mice, demyelination was significantly reduced in the treated mice. In 4 mice receiving A59 and anti-pan-caspase treatment demyelination was found in only 3/76 spinal cord quadrants (3.94%), whereas 6 untreated A59-infected mice in the same experiment had 18/120 demyelinating quadrants of spinal cord (15%), and mice receiving only treatment without infection had no demyelination. Although these studies are preliminary due to small number of animals, they may support an important role for apoptosis in autoimmune demyelination as in EAE and Theiler's virus induced demyelination.",

The kinetics, intensity and pattern of the apoptotic staining correlated well with the distribution of inflammation. However, apoptosis was found in both inflammatory cells (macrophages and possibly lymphocytes), and parenchymal cells such as hepatocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons and astrocytes. The involvement of parenchymal cells in CNS apoptosis and the location and temporal relationship between apoptosis and pathology (either encephalitis or demyelination), may indicate that apoptosis is indeed a significant factor in the pathogenesis of the disease and not a merely epiphenomenon. This conclusion is also supported by the reduced demyelination in animals lacking the Fas-lpr pro-apoptotic molecule and mice receiving prolonged pan-caspase inhibitor treatment. Since these treatments affect both inflammatory cells and parenchymal cells the result may be the balance between two opposing trends.",

A previous study did not find any difference in the extent of demyelination between wt and lpr mice 13 days following JHM infection (Parra et al 2000) .
