            "text": "Teschovirus A belongs to the family Picornaviridae and is a causal agent of the disease Teschovirus encephalomyelitis and other infections that remain asymptomatic. The present study was performed to design epitope-based peptide vaccine against Teschovirus A by identifying the potential T cell and B-cell epitopes from capsid proteins (VP1, VP3 and VP2) of the virus using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics approaches. In the current study, hexapeptide T-cell and octapeptide B-cell epitopes were analyzed for immunogenicity, antigenicity and hydrophilicity scores of each epitope. Each potential epitope was further characterized using ExPASy-ProtParam and Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD3) tools for determining various physical and chemical parameters of the epitope. One linear hexapeptide T-cell epitope, i.e., RPVNDE (epitope position 77-82) and one linear octapeptide B-cell epitope, i.e., AYSRSHPQ (236-243) were identified from the viral capsid protein as they possess the capability to raise effective immunogenic reaction in the host organism against the virus. Pharmaceutical industries could harness the results of this investigation to develop epitope-based peptide vaccines by loading the identified epitopes in combination with targeting signal peptides of T-cells and B-cells and then inserting the combination into virus like particle (vlp) or constructing subunit vaccines for further trial.",

            "text": "Teschovirus A was formerly known as Porcine Teschovirus (PTV) (Cano-G\u00f3mez et al. 2017 ) and it causes infectious diseases in wild boars and swine. The diseases include enchephalomyelitis, diarrhoea, myocarditis, pneumonia and reproductive loses (Long et al. 1966; Knowles 2008; Chiu et al. 2012) . Teschovirus A has been assigned to the genus Teschovirus, family Picornaviridae and order Picornavirales (Deng et al. 2012) . A set of 13 serotypes of Teschovirus A (PTV-1 to PTV-13) have been identified (Cano-G\u00f3mez and Jim\u00e9nez-Clavero 2016) . Majority of PTV serotypes may cause milder infection, myocarditis, pericarditis or reproductive disorders or may not produce any signs of infection at all in host organism. However, the serotype, i.e., PTV-1 has been known to cause infection of central nervous system (CNS) giving rise to neurological disease which may either show severe infection or mild infection (Edington et al. 1972) . Severe infection is known as Teschen disease while mild infection is called Talfan disease (Manuelidis et al. 1954; Knowles 2008) . Two different strains of PTV-1 are responsible for these two diseases (Doherty et al. 1999; Prod\u011blalov\u00e1 2012) . Any neurological disorder caused by Teschovirus A is termed as Teschovirus encephalomyelitis. The first outbreak of Teschovirus encephalomyelitis took place in 1929 at Teschen in Czechoslovakia (Trefny 1930) . Europe and its neighbouring continents were under the influence of this disease in [1940] [1941] [1942] [1943] [1944] [1945] [1946] [1947] [1948] [1949] [1950] . This havoc caused high mortality and morbidity of swine resulting in significant loss in swine industries (Kouba 2009 ). The disease spread widely across Ukraine, Russia, Madagascar, Japan, Maldavis, Romania, China and Uganda (Kouba 2009; Wang et al. 2010; Salles et al. 2011) .",

Moreover, an outbreak was reported recently where Teschovirus A affected farrows and caused diseases such as gastroenteritis and respiratory disease (Ventura et al. 2012) . Infection by this virus also resulted into abortion and stillbirth (Liu et al. 2011) . In recent years, severe outbreak was caused by Teschovirus A in Haiti, Canada and Dominican Republic and this had largely affected the morbidity and mortality rate of swines (Deng et al. 2012; Ventura et al. 2012) . It is very difficult to entirely eradicate the virus. In order to control the disease caused by this virus, attenuated or inactivated vaccines were used (Alexandersen et al. 2019) .",

These vaccines can lead to skin irritation and other side-effects (Harrison et al. 1999) . The development of peptide vaccine based on genomics and proteomics has been suggested as a potential intervention against disease causing organism (Jackwood et al. 2008) . Various preclinical studies stated that epitope based peptide vaccines formulated by reverse vaccinology showed promising outcomes (Davies and Flower 2007) . Bioinformatics tools provide a means for identifying the potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes for designing peptide vaccines against pathogen and moreover, the in vitro experiments for formulating vaccines have significantly decreased in quantity as a consequence of utilizing the in silico approach due to low cost and time requirements (Florea and Halldorsson 2003; Backert and Kohlbacher 2015) .

Certain components of the antigen, called epitopes of the invading agents are identified by these cells with the help of receptors present on their exterior surface (Weiss and Littman 1994) . On recognition of an antigen, the production of antibodies is mediated by B-cells which can destroy the antigenic particle. Moreover, B-cells also develop into memory cells which provide future protection against the foreign invaders (Chaplin 2010) . The destruction of foreign antigen by T-cells occurs in an organized fashion where a group of proteins called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules identify the antigen and exhibit them on APCs' surfaces and subsequently, T-cell receptor identifies the antigen presented by APCs and initiates its destruction (Valitutti et al. 1995; Jensen 2007; Lafuente and Reche 2009) .",

The hexapeptide T-cell epitopes were analyzed for determining their location within the proteins, their hydrophilicity scores and net charges (Table 1) . Among the five epitopes of the VP1 protein, three epitopes viz. SREHDE (epitope position 245-250), ESREHD (244-249) and EKAKDS (135-140) were found to carry a net charge of \u2212 2, \u2212 2 and 0 respectively and to have the highest hydrophilicity score of 11.8. Likewise, two hexapeptide epitopes, namely KNREIR (56-61) of VP3 protein and DDTDKH (177-182) of VP2 protein possessed the highest hydrophilicity score of 10.4 and 11.1 respectively while the total net charge of KNREIR was + 2 and that of DDT-DKH was \u2212 2. Epitopes with high hydrophilicity scores usually remain exposed on the protein surface and interact easily with antigen and thereby, produce immunogenic response against the antigens.",

All the five epitopes of VP1 protein contained amino acids at 16% and 33% level respectively, while in case of VP3 protein, the only epitope RPVNDE comprised of six different amino acids (16%). However, in case of VP2 protein, the epitopes i.e. DDTDKH, EPKFEE and FDDTDK were found to contain some amino acids up to 50% level. Amino acid composition of each octapeptide B-cell epitope was determined (Fig. 3b ). All the epitopes were found to have different composition of amino acids. For individual epitope, majority of amino acids consisted 12% of the total composition. Four epitopes viz, SSPSYMPG and ASPPNSPA of VP3 protein and HYHHTFDD and YSTWHYHH of VP2 protein contained amino acids that occurred at 12%, 25% or 37% level. The epitope, PRPGI-HDP of VP1 protein comprised of amino acids that appeared at 12% and 25% level, while the only epitope, RPDGQLTY of VP2 protein was made up of amino acids occurring at 12% level. The remaining epitopes were found to contain amino acids occurring at 12% and 25% level respectively.",

In the present study, both potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes from the capsid proteins of Teschovirus A were predicted in order to design peptide vaccines. Individual epitope was analyzed for different parameters using various bioinformatics tools. As various criteria are required to be satisfied by the epitopes for vaccine formulation, only a few promising epitopes of each protein were identified and analyzed for developing multiple-epitope loaded peptide vaccines. Kaku et al. (2007) reported that in the strain of PTV-1 serotype of Teschovirus A responsible for Talfan disease in swine and wild boars, antigenic sites of the capsid proteins (VP1, VP3 and VP2) were determined by a process based on epitope mapping. From their study, two sites, i.e., GH loop and C-terminal end of VP1 protein were estimated to be antigenic in nature while the antigenic site of VP2 protein was identified to be EF loop (Kaku et al. 2007) .",

Further we could infer that the negatively charged epitope, KPEEQP may not bind accurately with the negatively charged virion and cannot be suggested for formulating vaccines.
