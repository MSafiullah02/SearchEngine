Based on phylogenetic analysis, the SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a lineage B betacoronavirus8 and belongs to the same group as SARS-CoV-1 and HKU9-1, the bat coronavirus, demonstrating wide similarity with both genetically (Xu et al., 2020a) (96,2% of sequence identity with HKU9-1) (Ceraolo and Giorgi, 2020). The transmission was confirmed to be human-to-human once several medical care personnel and relatives got infected (Tian et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020a), but it is believed that it all started with an animal host, may it be a bat or another intermediate host (Zhou et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020a; Andersen et al., 2020; Shereen et al., 2020). Even though the virus usually does not cause severe damage to the body, as will be explained below, the major concern is its high infectivity and pathogenicity (Tian et al., 2020; Shereen et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a).",

Typically, these fragments of mAbs are fusion proteins from variable regions of the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins connected with a short linker peptide. Additional calculations were carried out for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD with a new proposed mAb based on CR3022. For most of these macromolecules, three dimensional crystallographic structures are available at the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000): (a) the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD protein was extracted from the PDB id 2AJF (chain E, resolution 2.9 \u00c5, pH 7.5) where it was found complexed with ACE2 (chain A) \u2212 see Fig. 2\n; (b) the fragment of the Ab 80R was taken out from the PDB id 2GHW (chain B, resolution 2.3 \u00c5, pH 4.6); (c) the anti-SARS-CoV-1 m396 Ab was extracted from the PDB id 2G75 (chains A and B, resolution 2.28 \u00c5, pH 8.5) removing part of the chains to keep only the variable regions and the short linker peptide; d) F26G19 Fab was taken out from PDB id 3BGF (chains L and C, resolution 3.0 \u00c5, pH 5.5), following the same procedure used for m396. Missing regions in these proteins were built up using the \u201cUCSF Chimera 1.11.2\u201d interface (Pettersen et al., 2004) of the program \u201cModeller\u201d with default parameters (Eswar et al., 2006). Fig. 3\nshows the molecular structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD complexed with these fragments of the mAbs. The isolated fragments of these mAbs in their final three-dimensional structures as used in this work are given in Figure S2. All PDB files were edited before the calculations. Water molecules and hetero atoms were completely removed from all used files. The \u201cUCSF Chimera 1.11.2\u201d package (Pettersen et al., 2004) was employed for all molecular visualizations and representations too.",

A model was built up at the SWISS-MODEL workspace (YP_009724390.1) based on the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512 (Arnold et al., 2006). The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions between this modeled structure for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the available one for SARS-CoV-1 (PDB id 2AJF) is 0.638\u00c5. The structural comparison between the RBD proteins of both SARS viruses can be seen in Fig. 1. This field is evolving so fast that new experimental structures are continuously been solved. For example, a cryo-EM structure is now available for the prefusion S glycoprotein (a homotrimer structure) with an incomplete RBD (PDB id 6VSB, resolution 3.46 \u00c5). This study revealed an interesting pivotal movement of the RBD between two transition states (\u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d conformations) with direct implications for the binding of ACE2 and/or Abs (Wrapp et al., 2020). At least two monomeric S units need to be at the \u201cup\u201d conformation and properly rotated to remove the steric hindrance which allows the binding (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). This implies at least a two-step \u201cexpose\u2013dock-like\u201d mechanism where the RBD has to be exposed towards the solution in the first step (characterized by important conformational adjustments of the whole homotrimeric structure) followed by the bind or dock phase where with the targeted-RBD can interact with other molecules. Here, the focus is at this second step of this mechanism where we assume that a single targeted-RBD structure is at its final state and prepared for the binding with the ligands (i.e. at least two S monomers were already at the \u201cup\u201d conformation, correctly rotated and there was no clashes between the targeted-RBD with any other parts of the trimeric structure that could prevent the binding) (Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). This is the same assumption for the available crystallographic structures (e.g. PDB id 2AJF). The conformational changes between the \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d conformations (the \u201cexpose\u201d phase) are not investigated in this work.",

Even more appropriate for the present discussion was the subsequent contribution by Yuan and co-authors that determined the crystal structure of the complex S RBD-CR3022 (PDB id 6W41, resolution 3.1 \u00c5, pH 4.6) (Yuan et al., 2020). Many other experimental structures for this complex are now available [PDB ids 6YM0 (X-ray, resolution 4.36 \u00c5, pH 8.0), 6YOR (cryo-EM, resolution 3.3 \u00c5), 6YLA (X-ray, resolution 2.42 \u00c5, pH 8.0)]. Such diversity of possible conformations might motivate further studies exploring their effects on the theoretical predictions. Additionally, the existence of such set of experimental structures for the complex RBD-CR3022 without the other parts of the S protein (or even the other chains of the S homotrimer) indicates that the missing structural part is not essential for the complexation at the dock phase of this \u201cexpose\u2013dock-like\u201d mechanism. These RMSD values above mentioned for the different chains (\u223c0.7 \u00c5 for PDB id 6VSB) also indicate that the modeled structure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus as used here is reasonable and within the expected conformational fluctuations from any other structure that could have been chosen for this work. Moreover, an intrinsic assumption here is that an experimental structure obtained at a given and specific physical chemical condition (ionic strength, pH, PEG6000 concentration, etc.) is valid in another condition (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020).",

The need to repeat the calculations on several different physical chemical conditions and to obtain free energy of interactions at them drives the options to the so-called cost-effective coarse-grained (CG) models. These CG models offer the possibility to explore the main physical features of a system with a reduced number of parameters and lower computational costs (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020; Barroso da Silva et al., 2016; Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016). During the last years, a fast constant-pH (CpH) CG model has been devised to successfully study protein-protein interactions of several biological systems (including host-pathogens interactions) (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020; Barroso da Silva et al., 2016; Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016; Persson et al., 2010; Mendon\u00e7a et al., 2019). The possibility to fully consider the pH effects makes this modeling approach more appealing and appropriated to address this problem (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020; Poveda-Cuevas and Etchebest, 2018).",

This CG process turns a protein atomistic structure as a collection of charged LJ particles representing their amino acids. The centers-of-masses of the beads (mimicking amino acids) are used to place them accordingly to the coordinates given by the three-dimensional structures. The values of Ri for each type of amino acids were taken from Ref. Persson et al. (2010). The valences of all ionizable residues are a function of the solution pH. The fast proton titration scheme (FPTS) (Teixeira et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2017; Barroso da Silva and Dias, 2017) was employed both to initially assign these valences zi\u2019s for the amino acids and to let them vary during the simulation sampling at a given pH. This method has proved to predict pK\na\u2019s with a very good accuracy at low computational costs (Silva et al., 2017). The fundamental physical chemical basis of this titration scheme, its numerical implementation, benchmarks, discussions related to its approximations, pros and cons can be found in previous publications (Teixeira et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2017; Barroso da Silva and Dias, 2017; Barroso da Silva et al., 2017).",

(Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020; Barroso da Silva et al., 2016; Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016). A simple and effective way to include their effects is by means of a LJ term [u\nvdw(rij)] between the beads (amino acids) (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020). Mathematically, for any two beads (charged or neutral ones) i and j, u\nvdw(rij) is given by(2)uvdw=4\u03b5LJ[(\u03c3ijrij)12-(\u03c3ijrij)6]where \u03c3ij (= Ri + Rj) is the separation distance of two amino acids i and j at contact. For instance, \u03c3ij for the pair VAL-GLU is 7.2 \u00c5 (= RVAL + RGLU, where RVAL =3.4 \u00c5 and RGLU =3.8 \u00c5 \u2013 see Ref. Persson et al. (2010). The possibility to use different sizes for these beads allows the incorporation of non-specific contributions from the hydrophobic effect in the model (Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016). This should preserve the macromolecular hydrophobic moments (Eisemberg et al., 1982) and contributes to guide a correct docking orientation at short separation distances (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020).",

Typically, \u03b5LJ is assumed to be universal for any biomolecular system and equals to 0.124 kJ/mol (Barroso da Silva et al., 2016; Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016; Persson et al., 2010; Hyltegren et al., 2020). This should correspond to a Hamaker constant of ca. 9kBT (kB = 1.380 \u00d7 10\u221223 m2 kgs-2 K-1 is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin) for amino acid pairs (Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016; Persson et al., 2010; Kurut et al., 2012). However, this value might result in both an over or an underestimation of the attraction depending on the biomolecular system (Barroso da Silva et al., 2016; Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016; Hyltegren et al., 2020). For instance, \u03b5LJ equals to 1.7kBT (a value 34 times greater than 0.124 kJ/mol) was necessary to reproduce experimental data for the histatin-5 adsorption to a hydrophilic silica surface (Hyltegren et al., 2020). Conversely, the? ?-lactoglobulin\u2013lactoferrin complexation seems to be overestimated by the usual value of \u03b5LJ (Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016). Consequently, our research strategy has been to adopt the consensus value of 0.05kBT (=0.124 kJ/mol) for \u03b5LJ. This also implies that the outcomes should be interpreted with relative caution bearing in mind all the intrinsic approaches assumed in the modeling. The direct impact is seen in the free energy derivatives as discussed later at the results section.",

It is a molecular process that involves different physical intermolecular interactions. Electrostatic interactions deserve a special attention in this process for several reasons [e.g. is long range nature, the fact that the interface antibody-antigen has a peculiar electrostatic pattern (richer in titratable groups) that is different than other general protein-protein interfaces (Ramaraj et al., 2012), etc.] (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020; Poveda-Cuevas and Etchebest, 2018).

It applies the fact that the location of these shifts is a practical mean to probe molecular interactions as before demonstrated (Srivastava et al., 2017). Moreover, this can be easily measured during computer simulations of a protein-protein complexation. The predictive properties of this powerful tool have been previously i) statistically analyzed for flaviviruses, ii) compared to other bioinformatic tools (that often ignore that pH and ionic strength can drastically affect the complexation process) and iii) discussed in details in a preceding work (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020). The capacity of this method to test EE for specific mAbs makes it even more appealing for the present study where four known mAbs should be investigated. For the sake of convenience, predicted EE for the studied systems were graphically compared at the sequence level. The pairwise sequence alignments were generated by the server EMBOSS Needle (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) with default settings.",

            "text": "One of the central questions in the understanding of the COVID-19, its pathology including the high transmissibility, and the possible therapeutic interventions to control the epidemics spreading is to decipher and prevent the molecular interactions between the S protein and ACE2 (Dimitrov, 2003; Zhu et al., 2013; Wevers and van der Hoek, 2010; B\u00f6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00e4user et al., 2018; Heald-Sargent and Gallagher, 2012; Li et al., 2005). This SARS S protein-ACE2 complexation is the first step toward infecting the cell by the virus. Several studies have shown that both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses share the function interaction with this cell receptor (i.e. ACE2) (Zhou et al., 2020; Dimitrov, 2003; Li et al., 2005; Hoffmann et al., 2020). We investigated the association pathway for the binding of the S RBD proteins to ACE2 for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses by means of constant-pH MC simulations at two different solution pH values (4.6 and 7.0). The calculated free energy of interactions as given by the potentials of mean force [\u03b2w(r)] for these studied pH conditions at physiological ionic strength are given at Fig. 6\n. Despite similar binding affinities observed in the present theoretical calculations (as seen in Fig. 6) and in the laboratory experiments (Tian et al., 2020), the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD protein has a small tendency to bind to the ACE2 at both pH regimes. This agrees quite well with the experimental results measured by the biolayer interferometry binding (BLI) assay as reported by Walls and co-authors using the functional subunit of the S protein responsible for binding to the host cell receptor (Walls et al., 2020). The measured binding affinity (KD) was 5.0 \u00b1 0.1 nM for the system SARS-CoV-1 S RDB (also referred to as the domain B (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018)\u2013ACE2 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 nM for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD\u2013ACE2. Yet, other experimental measurements using the S1 domain (this is the subunit that contains both the RBD and the N-terminal domain (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018) might suggest an inverted behavior where SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain would have a tendency for a stronger bind to ACE2 (KD = 15.0 \u00b1 0.1 nM) (Walls et al., 2019) in comparison to SARS-CoV-1 S (KD = 15.2 nM) (Tian et al., 2020). This small experimental difference of 0.2 nM could be due to several reasons including the experimental uncertainties that were not reported in Tian\u2019s work (Tian et al., 2020). In contrast to these results, another recent study (Wrapp et al., 2020) advocated that SARS-CoV-2 has greater binding affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV-1. Even so, both the present theoretical and previously reported experimental data do agree that SARS-CoV-1 S RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S RBD have similar attraction to the ACE2. This high binding affinity implies that all human organs rich on ACE2 (oral and nasal mucosa, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain) (Hamming et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2020b) can be easily infected. A clear opportunity for the virus is the lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, where ACE2 is abundant (Hamming et al., 2004).",

Also, this observation supports the argument that the dissociation of the S1 subunit complexed with ACE2 can happen without the interruption of the infection. This also allows the S2 subunit to transit from a metastable prefusion to its post-fusion state as a second step in the viral infection (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018).",

            "text": "At pH 4.6 which is closer to the low pH that occur outside the cell (Li, 2016; Millet and Whittaker, 2015), the association between the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD protein and ACE2 showed a free energy depth [\u03b2wmin] of \u22121.02 at the separation distance of 50.0 \u00c5 (see Fig. 6a). Conversely, for SARS-CoV-2 S RBD, \u03b2wmin is \u22120.95 at the separation distance of 49.5 \u00c5. The estimated standard deviations are 0.01kBT for all studied cases. Such computed measurements of \u03b2w(r) obtained by CG models that smooth the free-energy landscape must be interpreted with care as we already have pointed out above. By one side, it can be used a simple thermodynamic criterion that a negative free energy value (\u03b2wmin<0) would result in a molecular complex. Conversely, any free energy value smaller than the thermal energy (1 kBT) would indicate an unstable association. The observed difference (??\u03b2wmin) of 0.07 between the two RDB proteins is greater than the estimated statistical errors. However, we prefer to interpret such small differences as tendencies of the system. Based on previous studies (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020; Barroso da Silva et al., 2016; Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016; Mendon\u00e7a et al., 2019; Barroso da Silva et al., 2018) where we have observed either that the computed complexation was weaker than the experimental measurements or too much stronger, we feel safer to use this data (and the others discussed below) in relative terms (i.e. comparing different situations). This allows us to successfully predict experimental observations respecting the limits of such CG models (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020; Barroso da Silva et al., 2016; Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016; Mendon\u00e7a et al., 2019). The similarities between their free energy minima are relatively amplified at pH 4.6 (??\u03b2wmin = 0.07 as seen above) in comparison with pH 7.0 where \u03b2wmin is \u22121.11 and \u22121.06 (??\u03b2wmin = 0.05). Both viral S RBD proteins have their affinities to ACE2 slightly raised when pH is increased from the acid to the neutral regime. This somewhat higher binding affinity at neutral pH suggests that the role of pH for RBD proteins constantly under debate at the literature (Simmons et al., 2004; Dimitrov, 2003; Li et al., 2005; Kielian and Helenius, 1985) might not be so critical for the infection. It also reinforces the possibility that the viral cell invasion is not a pH-dependent process. Indeed, it seems that pH is more relevant for the next steps to continue the viral infection and not at the first entry level. This possible non pH-depend process might increase the opportunities for the SARS viruses to easily infect cells and therefore to contribute to its high infectivity. This might limit the use of chloroquine as an efficient drug against COVID-19 since its first action is to increase the cell pH. At least a neutral pH solution will not prevent the binding of the RBD to ACE2. On the opposite as it can favor this affinity.",

Following the work of Tian and collaborators (Tian et al., 2020), we investigated the interactions between the two SARS S RBD proteins with some of the most potent SARS-CoV-1 S RBD specific neutralizing antibodies (80R, F26G19, m396, CR3022). Fig. 7\nshows the free energy profiles at the acid regime and physiological salt conditions. For all studied fragments of Abs, a relatively stronger attraction is always observed for the S RBD protein from the SARS-CoV-1 interacting with any of these mAbs. This can be better seen in Fig. 7b where the region around the well depth is highlighted. The lowest observed binding affinities are observed for the system SARS-CoV-2-F26G19 (blue dashed line, \u03b2wmin = \u22120.63) followed by SARS-CoV-2-80R (black dashed line, \u03b2wmin = \u22120.66) and SARS-CoV-2-m396 (green dashed line, \u03b2wmin = \u22120.67). The difference between SARS-CoV-1-80R and SARS-CoV-2-m396 (??\u03b2wmin = 0.01) is within the estimated statistical errors. The most promising complexation was found for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-CR3022 (red dashed line, \u03b2wmin = \u22120.79) which is in good agreement with the experimental measurements (Tian et al., 2020). In fact, this was the only mAb that could bind potently with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (KD of 6.3 nM determined by BLI assay) in the experiments performed by Tian and co-authors using the Ab isolated from the blood of a convalescent SARS patient (Tian et al., 2020). This cross-reactivity binding between SARS-CoV-1 and 2 of CR3022 has been confirmed by other recent experimental studies (Yuan et al., 2020). Nevertheless, CR3022 could not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the experimental in vitro study (which does not exclude the possibility for in vivo neutralization) (Yuan et al., 2020). The Ab m396 only showed an insignificant binding at the highest measured concentration of 2 \u03bcM in the experimental studies (Tian et al., 2020).",

            "text": "Next, we explored basic physical chemical aspects that could offer a simple and quick reasoning to understand the above free energy results and eventually be used as descriptors to scan databases of mAbs to filter promising ideal candidates. Although different driven forces can result in protein-protein complexation (Barroso da Silva et al., 2016; Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016), pH and charge-charge interactions seems especially important for viral proteins (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020; Poveda-Cuevas and Etchebest, 2018; Yoshida et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2005; Lamarre and Talbot, 1989; Jaume et al., 2011). Indeed, the protein net charges numbers (Z) obtained as function of the solution pH show that the SARS-CoV-2 S RDB protein is always slightly more positively charged than SARS-CoV-1 S RDB protein at the same physical chemical environment (Z equals to 5.2 and 5.5, respectively, for them at pH 4.6) \u2212 see Table 1\n. Since all studied fragments of Abs are also positively charged at pH 4.6 (Z equals to 9.1, 4.2, 2.7, 5.8 for 80R, CR3022, m396 and F26G19, respectively), it can be easily seen that the order observed for the binding affinities above in the free energy analyses do follow a simple charge-charge rule for the mAbs with similar surface area (A\u223c10,000 \u00c52). For the SARS-CoV-1 S RDB protein, from the weaker to the stronger repulsive cases in terms of the Coulomb contributions (Zi*Zj assuming the same Bjerrum length, salt screening and separation distances (Barroso da Silva et al., 2016; Delboni and Barroso da Silva, 2016; J\u00f6nsson et al., 2007), the predicted order for the binding affinity is 80R (5.2*9.1 = 47.3) < F26G19 (5.2*5.8 = 30.2) < CR3022 (5.2*4.2 = 21.8). This agrees with the previous free energy analyses (see above). As large is A, larger is the attractive van der Waals interactions that can overcome the charge-charge repulsion. This can also explain why m396 (that is smaller and has roughly half of A) is less attracted to the RBD proteins even being slightly less positively charged (Z equals to 2.7 at pH 4.6) than the others (Z\u223c5\u22126). Similarly, this is the physical reason to understand the stronger binding affinity that ACE2 (A = 25,290\u00c52) has to the S RBD proteins. Although ACE2 (Z = 5.4) and F26G19 (Z = 5.8) have similar Zs, the molecular surface of ACE2 is ca. 2.5 times larger than F26G29 (A = 10,120 \u00c52). We tested the van der Waals (vdw) contribution comparing? ?w(r) for CR3022 and m396 in a model where all electrostatic interactions where completely switched off and only vdw interactions are considered. This test-case system is shown in Figure S2. It can be seen that m396 in this hypothetical test does have a weaker binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD protein in comparison to CR3022 confirming the arguments above presented.",

Two amino acids substitutions (K170A and R194A) are suggested at this biological interface while the other one (K12E) is more peripheral (see Fig. 8). Doing such mutations, the Z of the new molecule (labeled CR3022\u2032) drops down from +4.2 to +1.2 at pH 4.6 and from +1.0 to \u22123.0 at pH 7.0.",

By the different distribution of amino acids identified as EE (shown in blue), it can be seen that the electrostatic method is sensitive to the structures and their titratable groups that can produce electrical perturbations on their partners when they are interacting as demonstrated before (Poveda-Cuevas et al., 2020). The patterns observed for both viral SARS proteins are similar (i.e. they share a common region when they bind to ACE2 as observed in some experimental structures (Yuan et al., 2020) although some interesting observations can be made. Comparing the number of ionizable residues involved in the interactions for the RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and ACE2 with the pair SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE2, we can see an increase from 30 to 40 with a high number of common cases (22 amino acids) where the same amino acid interacts with ACE2 for both viral proteins. Most of the differences are observed for neighbor groups (e.g. \u201cAWERKKISN\u201d for SARS-CoV-1 and \u201cAWNRKRISN\u201d for SARS-CoV-2) indicating that the same biological interface was explored by the two viral RBD proteins in spite of their structural differences. The RBD protein responsible for COVID-19 clearly has more titratable residues interacting with ACE2 than its precursor. This observation suggests that its binding to ACE2 might be less specific than what happens for SARS-CoV-1. As such, the presence of an Ab may not completely block the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE2 interaction. In general, as seen in this Figure, most of the titratable groups from the viral RBD proteins involved in the binding to ACE2 are also the antigenic regions of the studied fragments of mAbs.",

A replacement of an amino acid from the same physical chemical group (e.g. D by E) can be enough to result in different interactions (e.g. \u201cKGDDVRQIA\u201d for SARS-CoV-1 and \u201cRGDEVRQIA\u201d for SARS-CoV-2). CR3022 perturbed more titratable groups: 27 for SARS-CoV-1 and 33 for SARS-CoV-2 (22 % more). Using a different criterion to determine the epitopes, Yuan and co-authors also observed an increase of 15 % in the number of titratable residues at the epitope for SARS-CoV-2 (Yuan et al., 2020). Taking into account what was hypothesized for ACE2 above, this might be an addition contribution to improve the capability of this mAb to interact and inhibit the RBD proteins. In fact, the experimental work of Tian et al. (2020) do show that the CR3022 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD is not affected by ACE2. This might be the molecular basis for this behavior. We are careful with the use of stronger statements here due to the limitation of the theoretical approach. Several additional issues remain to be further investigated.",

This implies that the suggested mutations here do not affected the antigenic regions. Another particularly interesting feature of this computer-designed molecule is that the number of EEs shared with ACE2 has increased from 18 (for CR3022) to 27 (for CR3022\u2019).
