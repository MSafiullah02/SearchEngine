The left lung is slightly smaller (since the heart is placed a bit to the left in the body) and has two lobes, and the right lung is bigger, with three lobes. They are spongy and elastic organs that are broad at the bottom and taper at the top. They consist of air sacs, the alveoli. Many alveoli group together and open into a common space. From this space arise the alveolar ducts, which join together to form bronchioles. The bronchioles connect them to the respiratory tract. The lungs also have blood vessels, the branches of the pulmonary artery and veins (Fig. 15.1).\n\n",

Smoking is by far the most common cause of COPD.\nEmphysema: A form of COPD usually caused by smoking. The fragile walls between the lungs' air sacs (alveoli) are damaged, trapping air in the lungs and making breathing difficult.\nPneumonia: Infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the most common cause.\nAsthma: The lungs\u2019 airways (bronchi) become inflamed and can spasm, causing shortness of breath and wheezing. Allergies, viral infections, or air pollution often triggers asthma symptoms.\nAcute bronchitis: An infection of the lungs\u2019 large airways (bronchi), usually caused by a virus. Cough is the main symptom of acute bronchitis.\nPulmonary fibrosis: A form of interstitial lung disease. The interstitium (walls between air sacs) become scarred, making the lungs stiff and causing shortness of breath.\nPleurisy: Inflammation of the lining of the lung (pleura), which often causes pain when breathing in. Autoimmune conditions, infections, or a pulmonary embolism may cause pleurisy.\nLung cancer: Cancer may affect almost any part of the lung. Most lung cancer is caused by smoking.\nTuberculosis: A slowly progressive pneumonia caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Chronic cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats are common symptoms of tuberculosis.\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Severe, sudden injury to the lungs caused by a serious illness. Life support with mechanical ventilation is usually needed to survive until the lungs recover.\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis (allergic alveolitis): Inhaled dust causes an allergic reaction in the lungs. Usually, this occurs in farmers or others who work with dried, dusty plant material.\nPulmonary hypertension: Many conditions can lead to high blood pressure in the arteries leading from the heart to the lungs. If no cause can be identified, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.\nPulmonary embolism: A blood clot (usually from a vein in the leg) may break off and travel to the heart, which pumps the clot (embolus) into the lungs. Sudden shortness of breath is the most common symptom of a pulmonary embolism.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): A severe pneumonia caused by a specific virus first discovered in Asia in 2002. Worldwide prevention measures seem to have controlled SARS, which has caused deaths in India but no deaths in the U.S.\n",

Prior to operating on the recipient, the transplant surgeon inspects the donor lung(s) for signs of damage or disease. If the lung or lungs are approved, then the recipient is connected to an intervenous line and various monitoring equipment, including pulse oximetry.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome has a mortality rate of 50% and affects 1.50 lakh Americans each year [2]. Many patients waiting for lung transplants die while on the waiting list. To help combat these problems, artificial lungs have been developed with the goal of replacing or supplementing the respiratory function of the lung. Artificial lungs mimic the function of real lungs, adding oxygen to, and removing carbon dioxide from, the blood. In all cases, however, the performance of artificial lungs is still significantly lower than that of natural lungs. The human lung is a remarkable organ, providing a maximum gas exchange rate for both O2 and CO2 of 2\u20136 l/min [3]. On the other hand, current artificial lungs are only capable of a maximum gas exchange rate of 0.25\u20130.40 l/min, limiting their use to the short-term respiratory support for patients at rest. This insufficiency is due to the smaller surface area, smaller surface-area-to-volume ratio, and greater membrane thickness of artificial lungs compared to the human lung [3].",
