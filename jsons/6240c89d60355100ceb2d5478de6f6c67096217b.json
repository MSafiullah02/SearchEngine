Clinically, this syndrome is recognized by an increase in the volume and purulence of the lower respiratory tract secretions and is frequently associated with signs of variable airflow obstruction. In the intensive care unit (ICU), tracheobronchitis is a relatively common problem with an incidence as high as 10.6 % [1] . Although tracheobronchitis is associated with a significantly longer length of ICU stay and a prolonged need for mechanical ventilation, it has not been shown to increase mortality. These outcomes can be improved through the use of antimicrobial agents [1] .",

Mechanically ventilated patients are particularly at risk for tracheobronchitis given the presence of an endotracheal tube. These devices contribute to the pathogenesis of tracheobronchitis (and pneumonia) in a variety of manners: bypassing natural host defenses, acting as a nidus for biofilm formation, allowing pooled secretions and bacteria to leak around the cuff and into the trachea, damaging the ciliated epithelium and reducing bacterial clearance directly or via frequent suctioning to maintain airway patency [3, 4] .",

The effectiveness of mucociliary clearance depends on the composition of airway secretions, the function of the mucociliary escalator apparatus, and the presence of an effective cough reflex [16] . Artificial airways promote both colonization and the subsequent development of tracheobronchitis or pneumonia as they provide direct access for bacteria to the lower respiratory tract, reduce the effectiveness of cough re-flexes, and compromise the mucociliary escalator [17, 18] . Furthermore, endotracheal tube insertion and suctioning may cause tracheal epithelial cell damage allowing bacterial adherence and increased mucus secretion and stagnation [19, 20] . Respiratory therapy devices, including medication nebulizers, ventilator spirometers, and ventilatory circuits with their attendant condensate, may play roles in harboring and transmitting bacteria [21, 22] .",

In one study, 7 of 15 patients with a chronic tracheostomy were colonized with various Pseudomonas species: all seven of them subsequently developed an episode of purulent tracheobronchitis [27] .

This is perhaps the most likely form of serious fungal infection to be missed clinically. Patients may complain of cough, chest pain, increasing dyspnea, fever, hemoptysis, and, possibly, signs of upper airway obstruction.

Fungal tracheobronchitis has been seen in patients with lung and bone marrow transplantation, AIDS, and hematological malignancies [52] . Prolonged neutropenia occurring either secondary to the malignancy or chemotherapy has been shown to be a risk factor for developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [53] . Even in the absence of neutropenia, impaired leukocyte mobilization and function may contribute to the predisposition to fungal infection in cancer patients [54] . Pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis has also been reported in patients with diabetes [40] . Corticosteroids predispose to the development of fungal invasion by inhibiting macrophage killing of spores, inhibiting phagocyte migration to the site of infection, and by suppressing antibody production, delayed hypersensitivity reaction, and wound healing [43, 55] . Broad-spectrum antibiotics change the normal flora and predispose to the development of fungal colonization. Cellular and humoral immune deficiency are additional risk factors [56] .",

It can occur in pandemics, epidemics or sporadically. Almost all severe epidemics and all pandemics are caused by type A influenza. Typical winter outbreaks occur every year in temperate climates with a less predictable seasonal variation in tropical areas. Transmission occurs from person to person with an incubation period of 24-48 h and is highly contagious. Viral shedding and infectivity can persist for as long as 2 weeks in children, but probably less in adults [60] . Antibody formation to specific strains by either immunization or infection confers immunity for 1 -2 years. Serologic studies have found a higher incidence of antibodies to influenza A and B in health care workers than controls [61] . The risk of developing a complicated course is increased in the older individuals, and those with a significant history of tobacco smoking, comorbidities and pregnancy [62 -64] . Recent outbreaks of avian influenza virus infections in humans have been the source of concern for a potential influenza pandemic. Since 2004, the H5N1 influenza A virus has expanded from southern China to western China, Mongolia, Russia, and, more recently, Europe and Africa. Humans acquire avian influenza through direct contact of mucous membranes with infected secretions and excreta from infected birds or contaminated poultry. Human-to-human transmission of avian influenza has thus far only occurred sporadically and with low efficiency [65] .",

Another syndrome seen in influenza is bronchitis/tracheobronchitis with no radiographic abnormality but with more respiratory distress and sometimes associated with hemoptysis, exacerbation of underlying asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In more severe cases, spread of the virus to the pulmonary parenchyma causes clinical worsening within 12 -36 h with worsening dyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis and hypoxemia [66, 67] . The radiographic abnormalities of influenza pneumonia include interstitial infiltrates, lobar consolidation with air bronchograms, and focal areas of atelectasis. Finally, it is well recognized that superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae or other bacteria can occur after influenza [68] . The clinical manifestations of avian influenza infection also depend on the viral subtype causing the disease. Conjunctivitis, with or without an influenza-like illness, occurs with the A/H7N7 and A/H7N3 strains. A/H5N1 strains lead to more severe presentations with frequent progression to pneumonia and a high fatality rate. Gastrointestinal complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are common. Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are common findings and prognostic indicators for ARDS and death [69] .",

However, future prospective, randomized trials that assess the impact of treatment on the outcome of both the apparently asymptomatic HSV \"carrier\" and those patients with clinical HSV tracheobronchitis are needed to clarify this issue. In addition, given the risk of horizontal transmission of HSV-1 to health-care workers, full compliance with infection control measures, including use of gloves and goggles when there is any potential for contact with secretions, is recommended [101] .",

In contrast to HSV where the predominant involvement occurs in the airways, CMV typically involves the pulmonary parenchyma, leading to interstitial pneumonitis or diffuse alveolar damage. CMV infection has been shown to potentiate effects of bacterial infections, possibly through impairment of neutrophil migration or macrophage activation, and has been implicated in promoting bacterial translocation [94] . Cardiac surgery patients with CMV infection complicating mediastinitis have been shown to have persistence of local infection, prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality [103] .
