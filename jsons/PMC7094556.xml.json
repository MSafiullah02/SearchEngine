            "text": "Zika virus was first isolated in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys and spread beyond its historical endemic range in equatorial Africa and Asia to areas of Micronesia in 2013-2014.12 Up until 2007, when a large epidemic in the Yap Islands resulted in the infection of three-quarters of the approximately 270,000 residents,13 ZIKV infections remained limited to periodic cases or small-scale epidemics. Since being detected in 2015 in Brazil, with reported cases of congenital malformations and other neurologic disorders linked to ZIKV infection (in French Polynesia and Brazil), ZIKV has spread to many countries in South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and briefly into the United States. On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding microcephaly, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), and other neurologic conditions associated with the appearance of ZIKV in the Americas. On November 18, 2016, the WHO ended this Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It is projected that nearly 400 million individuals can be potentially infected with ZIKV annually (similar to dengue virus [DENV] infection and burden),14 as the distribution of the Aedes mosquito species (Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Aedes polynesiensis, and Aedes hensilli) associated with ZIKV transmission is widespread. A recent study estimates that 22.7 million people in the United States live in areas with active year-round populations of the Aedes mosquito vectors, setting the stage for possible year-round ZIKV transmission.15 Local transmission has already occurred in US territories in the Caribbean and Pacific regions, demonstrating the unexpected ability of ZIKV to quickly spread to nonepidemic regions. Countries with a documented presence of ZIKV (as of March 2018) are shown in Figure A\n, and countries suitable for A aegypti and A albopictus are shown in Figure B.",

Notably, the nonstructural NS5 protein is implicated in RNA synthesis and viral replication. Importantly, the proteins documented to have significance in terms of immune response include nonstructural protein NS5 that has been shown to suppress type I IFN signaling through STAT2-mediated degradation in the ZIKV-infected host.42 During viral shedding, prM is cleaved by furin protein to generate mature infectious virions. Zika virus E protein is the main surface protein that participates in host cell receptor attachment and virus lipid bilayer fusion, while the nonstructural NS1 through NS5 proteins are engaged in virus propagation. Robust adaptive immune responses to ZIKV E, NS1, NS3, NS4B, and NS5 proteins such as production of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses have been detected in animal models of ZIKV infection, which indicates that vaccination may protect against ZIKV disease.43, 44, 45, 46\n",

Disruption of IFN responses is required for disease manifestations. The most common models are inbred strains on the 129 background that lack the IFNAR1 (A129) or both the IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 (AG129) and a strain on the B6 background lacking IFNAR1. Severe combined immunodeficiency mice also develop disease but at a delayed rate compared with AG129. Mice lacking INF response factors (IRFs) (eg, IRF3, IRF5, IRF7) also exhibit disease symptoms on experimental infection. Unfortunately, the immunosuppressed nature of these animals complicates vaccine development and testing.

Neutralizing antibody titers were low but detectable after a single immunization and were significantly increased following the booster immunization. Mice were pretreated with IFNAR-blocking antibody and then challenged with ZIKV (Dakar 41519).

Multiple vaccine candidates are already in preclinical through phase 2 studies, with some poised to enter phase 3 studies of efficacy. This is remarkable given the fact that Zika virus went relatively unnoticed until the large outbreaks in Brazil starting in 2016. On the positive side, this extraordinary progress has resulted from collaborations among academia, biotech start-ups, pharmaceutical companies, nongovernmental organizations, and a variety of funders. On the negative side, inadequate research funding, late funding given the initial outbreaks in the Yap Islands in 2007, and a variety of difficulties in moving vaccine candidates down the development pipeline, have slowed progress. In particular, governments must invest the research and development dollars and provide industry incentives for rapid clinical development to occur. This must be a shared burden but should particularly have intense and sustained involvement by the countries where mosquito abatement has been \u201ctoo little too late\u201d and where outbreaks of this disease have developed. Additionally, these outbreaks are an excellent example of the need for a global funding entity\u2014as called for in a recent publication. It is likely that in the private sector, the costs of Zika vaccine development cannot be recouped due to the relative lack of current and ongoing large-scale outbreaks.
