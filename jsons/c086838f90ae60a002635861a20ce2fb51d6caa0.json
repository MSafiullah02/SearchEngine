The aims of this study were to estimate burnout, perceived stress, job satisfaction, coping and general health levels experienced by nurses working in emergency departments in Spain and to analyze the relationships between sociodemographic, occupational, and psychological variables and the occurrence of burnout syndrome among these professionals. A cross-sectional study was conducted in four emergency departments in Andalusia (Spain) from March to December 2016. The study sample was composed of n = 171 nurses. An ad hoc questionnaire was prepared to collect sociodemographic and work data, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale, the Font-Roja Questionnaire, the Brief Cope Orientation to Problem Experience and the General Health Questionnaire were used. The prevalence of high burnout was 8.19%. The levels of perceived stress and job satisfaction were moderate. The most frequent clinical manifestations were social dysfunction and somatic symptoms, and problem-focused coping was the strategy most used by nurses. Lack of physical exercise, gender, years worked at an emergency department, anxiety, social dysfunction, and avoidance coping were significant predictors of the dimensions of burnout.",

Some professionals will thrive in the same seemingly stressful environment. One important factor that may influence the likelihood of job stress and burnout is an individual's coping style, defined as the cognitive and behavioral efforts applied by an individual to manage stress [30] . Researchers [18, 31] have found a significant relationship between adaptive coping strategies-understood as those responses that actively and directly deal with a stressor, improving the adaptation outcome [32]-and a decreased level of burnout. In ED, staff are more likely to use maladaptive coping strategies-defined as negative and ineffective cognitive or behavioral responses to stress and anxiety [33]-compared with other clinical areas [34] .",

            "text": "Burnout is a psychological syndrome emerging as a prolonged response to chronic interpersonal stressors at work. The three key dimensions of this response are: (i) emotional exhaustion (EE), or a loss of enthusiasm in one's work; (ii) depersonalization (DP), or an impersonal response to patients; and (iii) personal accomplishment (PA), or a feeling of carrying out one's job successfully [1, 2] . Burnout has been included in the 11 th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases as an occupational phenomenon [3] affecting a broad spectrum of workers [4] . Healthcare professionals are more likely to develop burnout [5] , and nurses in particular are among the major risk groups [6] . Studies have reported high values in this respect for nurses [7, 8] .",

This is consistent with the results of another study carried out among emergency and intensive nursing staff [63] . The use of adaptive coping styles produces a positive effect on physical and psychological well-being, management of stress, and overall performance among healthcare professionals [64] , which is related to an improvement in the quality of care, greater patient safety, and a fall in health service costs [65] . This is congruent with our results that showed that the use of problem-focused coping reduced both social dysfunction and anxiety and depressive symptomatology. We found that the most commonly used coping strategy was problem-focused coping and the least common was avoidance coping, as in similar studies [18, 64, [66] [67] [68] . The use of avoidance coping may be explained by the low level of personal suffering due to the high turnover rate occurring in EDs [56] . In the multivariate analysis, EE and DP were determined positively by the use of avoidance coping, which was consistent with the findings of other authors [69, 70] . It should be noted that some authors have long argued that the DP dimension is in fact a coping style [71, 72] . In addition, this type of coping was positively related to somatic symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction, and depression. These results were similar to those of Yates et al. [73] . Nevertheless, avoidance coping may be the best option for ED personnel when an event occurs in order to avoid emotional involvement [74] .",

The significantly higher EE scores in women may be due to the social role played by women and their effort to strike a better work-life balance [79] . In addition, work-family conflicts are considered important risk factors in the development of burnout among women [80] . Regarding the age of ED nurses, G\u00f6k\u00e7en et al. [81] determined that this was positively related to EE. On the other hand, Schooley et al. [75] also found the same relationships and a significant positive relationship with DP. Lloyd et al. [82] showed that with age, the level of DP decreased, while the level of PA increased in ED physicians. In the present study, a significant negative relationship was found between age and the PA level, which is due to the fact that, over time, daily work with people tends to lead to feelings of personal inadequacy and low professional self-esteem as a result of the lack of concern for the problems of others and the loss of empathy [81] .",

Furthermore, no relationship was found between smoking and the dimensions of burnout. This result is similar to that obtained in ED physicians [84] . DP, in the multivariate analysis, was determined by the absence of daily physical exercise. Likewise, Goldberg et al. [85] reported that low levels of physical exercise were a predictor of burnout in ED personnel. It has been suggested that regular physical exercise facilitates psychological detachment from work and increases people's self-efficacy. As a result, ED nurses may feel more able to cope with their work duties and may find the tasks less demanding, which reduces the risk of burnout. In addition, regular physical exercise may result in the body recovering faster after exposure to stress and may induce changes in several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, leading to a better mood and increased energy, thus reducing the risk of burnout [86] .",

Working in an ED involves dealing with unexpected situations, patients who have life-threatening pathologies, and more frequent attacks or assaults than other specialized medical units, which may produce lack of assertive skills in nursing professionals and, as a result, low PA [11, 87] . However, here, too, there are conflicting findings. While Popa et al. [88] found no relationship between years worked in EDs and the level of burnout, other studies have found a significant positive relationship evident in two periods, corresponding to workers in the first two years of their professional career and those with over ten years of experience. In these stages, the relationship with burnout is lower [85, 89] .",
