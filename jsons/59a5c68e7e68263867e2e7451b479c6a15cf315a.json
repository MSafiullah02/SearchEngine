Data calculated: Descriptors (descriptors were calculated with CoMFA, CoM-SIA, EVA, HQSAR, and traditional 2D and 2.5D descriptors were computed from CORINA structures and Gasteiger-Marsili charges). Results: A comparative study of methods for modeling quantitative structure-activity relationships has been performed using descriptors calculated with CoMFA, CoMSIA, HQSAR, EVA and traditional 2D and 2.5D descriptors and methods, and in addition GFA, genetic PLS, and back-propagation NN methodologies. The predictive accuracy of these methods was examined using designed test sets of inhibitors for ACE, AChE, BZR, COX-2, DHFR, GPB THER, and THR. For virtual screening applications HQSAR proved to be the most promising of the approaches examined. Fieldbased 3D QSAR methods were found to be the most predictive for extrapolating outside the training set. When 2.5D descriptors were used, only CNN ensembles were found to be similarly or more predictive than PLS models. In addition, it was shown that many cross-validation procedures yielded similar estimates of the interpolative accuracy of methods. The lack of correspondence between cross-validated and test set predictive accuracy for four sets highlighted the advantage of using designed test sets. Only those methods were examined which are available in commercial software packages. There are many approaches that have been described in the literature that appear very predictive while overcoming limitations of established methods (e.g., CoMMA, MS-WHIM, 4D-QSAR, Quasar, PharmPrint, GRIND, etc. Biological material: a) Dopamine D 2 receptor subtype; b) HIV-1 protease (HIV PR), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), nAChR. Data taken from the literature: IC 50 [concentration of the test substance required for 50% inhibition of the D2 receptor subtype (details not given)]; b) HIV PR inhibitors, cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors, nAChR ligands as well as anxiolytic agents) with biological data against their target. Computational methods: MIA-QSAR [Multivariate Image Analysis QSAR was performed as follows: 2D structures of each compound of type I were drawn in the ChemSketch module of ACDLabs program and saved in Paint Brush as bmp files, with resolution of 64 \u00c2 64 points per inch, the bitmap windows were cut to a 185 pixels \u00c2 143 pixels size to minimize memory and the drawn molecules were systematically fixed in a given coordinate by a common point among them, each image was unfolded to an 1 \u00c2 26,455 row and then the 58 images were grouped to form a calibration set matrix of 40 \u00c2 26,455 and a validation set matrix of 18 \u00c2 26,455, a calibration set matrix of 40 \u00c2 12,727 and a validation set matrix of 18 \u00c2 12,727 was constructed, bilinear (conventional) PLS was utilized as the regression method and leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to derive the QSAR model]; PLS (Partial Least Squares projections to latent structures analysis was performed using the NI-PALS algorithm); LOO (Leave-One-Out cross-validation). (cross-validated correlation coefficient). Results: A simple 2D image-based approach, MIA-QSAR, for quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis is presented. The performance of the method was demostrated by using a well known set of dopamine D 2 ligands of type I, which was divided in 40 calibration compounds and 18 test compounds and 26 455 descriptors were generated from pixels of 2D structures of each compound, drawn with an appropriate program. Bilinear PLS was utilized as the regression method and LOO cross-validation was performed.

Results: Small molecule PK inhibitors are widely employed as biological reagents and as leads in the design of drugs for a variety of diseases. One of the hardest challenges in kinase inhibitor design is achieving target selectivity. The following five kinases were chosen to represent the kinase space: PKA, Src, Cdk2, Erk2, and Gsk3.

In fact, the steric descriptors in all the equations have generally great weight and, except L in Eq. 4, their regression coefficient is always negative. The present results confirmed the putative importance of the 2,6-disubstitution, regarding in particular the two methoxy groups at the phenyl residue of 2-[(2-phenoxyethyl)aminomethyl]-1,4-benzodioxane for the interaction with the a-ARs and, especially, with the a 1a -AR subtype. It was also resolved that such a feature is not essential to the interaction with the 5-HT 1A receptor as proven by the high and specific 5-HT 1A affinity of the unsubstituted derivative (S)-1 as well as of several WB4101 analogues suitably ortho monosubstituted at the phenyl ring. [three types of molecular descriptors were calculated using Hyperchem v7 software: HOMO and LUMO energies, dipole moments (DM), electronegativity (c), electrophilicity (w), softness (S), and hardness (h ) were used to account the electronic features of the molecules; molecular surface area (MSA), molar volume (MV), molar refractivity (MR),lipophilicity (logP), and hydration energy (HE) were the physicochemical properties that calculated for each molecule; Dragon software was used for the calculation of topological indices such as total structure connectivity index (Xt), average connectivity index (X1A), average valence connectivity index (X2Av), sum of topological distance between N and Cl atoms (TN-Cl), and path/walk-3 randic shape index (PW3), and functional group indices including number of total primary carbons (nCp), and number of total secondary carbons (nCs)]; MEP [Molecular Electrostatic Potential (kcal/mol) was calculated using the semiempirical AM1 method]. Chemical descriptors: nCp (number of total primary carbons). Results: Design, synthesis, antibacterial and QSAR studies of benzimidazole of type I and imidazole chloroaryloxyalkyl derivatives of type II was performed. Some of these compounds showed considerable bactericidal activities against S. aureus and S. typhi. Calculation and mapping of MEP over the compounds revealed that negative electrostatic potentials around oxygen of the phenoxy and nitrogen of the imidazole moieties have direct effect on the antibacterial activity towards S. aureus A 15091. Fig. 1 shows the overlaid 3D structure of the imidazole and benzimidazole derivatives. Significant linear regression equations were calculated for the logMIC values against S. aureus using HOMO energy, hydration energy and number of primary carbon atoms of the molecules (Eq. 1, Eq. 2). (the 3D structures of the molecules were built using the molecular modeling package Hyper-chemPro v6.02, energy minimizations were performed with the MM \u00fe force field using the Polak-Ribiere minimization algorithm, low energy conformations of the SLs were created using the conformational search option, the final geometries were obtained with the semiempirical AM1 method; MLR (Multiple Linear Regression analysis was performed using the SAS v6.12 statistical software package, relevant descriptors were selected using the REG procedure). Data calculated: Descriptors (constitutional, topological, electrostatic and quantum chemical descriptors were calculated using the software CAChe: total number of a,b unsaturated carbonyl structures in the molecule, UNC; a-methylene-g-lactone, ML; conjugated ester groups, UNA; conjugated keto or aldehyde functions, ENONE; number of oxygen atoms, ATOM; number of hydroxyl groups, OH; octanol water partition coefficient, LOGP; electron affinity, EA; dipole moment, DIPOL; molar refractivity, MR; connectivity indices, CN0 -2; shape indices, SH1 -3; highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO; lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, LUMO1 -3). Results: The sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) inhibit the transcription factor NF-kB probably by alkylating cys 38 in the DNA binding domain of the p65 subunit. The SLs have been suggested to serve as lead compounds for the design of new antiinflammatory drugs. In this study, QSAR analysis of a set of 103 different SLs as inhibitors of NF-kB has been performed using MLR. Sub-groups of SLs were subjected to analysis. The results indicated that topological and structurecoding parameters explained the NF-kB inhibitory activity of SLs possessing a rigid skeleton (furanoheliangolides and guaianolides), whereas in the case of flexible skeletons (germacranolides, such as germacrolides and melampolides),inhibition might be mostly determined by reactivity parameters, such as the number and type of a,b-unsaturated carbonyl structural elements. The following significant linear regression equations were calculated for all major skeletal classes (Eq. 1), for germacranolides (Eqs. 2,3), heliangolides (Eq. 4). Fig. 1 shows the plot of the calculated versus experimental pIC 100 values for heliangolides computed using Eq. 4. The QSAR studies described here and in previous studies showed that inhibtory activity conditions correlated mostly with the structure-cytotoxcity requirements. Therefore, it was unlikely to separate the desired therapeutic effects from the unwanted side effects such as cytotoxicity. This is also valid for the allergenic properties of the compounds. In order to avoid this problem the SLs could be either applied externally, or they could be designed as a prodrug that would be liberated at the location of inflammation for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.

Results: QSAR analysis of the acute immobilization toxicity of 22 benzoic acid derivatives to D. magna has been performed using MLR involving logP and N OH descriptors. Toxicity, expressed as EC 50 value, depended primarily on the number and position of phenolic hydroxyl groups. The benzoic acids with ortho-substituted hydroxyl groups were more toxic than benzoic acids with meta-and/or para-substituted hydroxyl groups. In contrast, methoxy substitution exerted relatively small and variable effects on the toxicity. Of the tested compounds, the 2,4,6-TH showed the highest toxicity in the 48 h EC 50 of 10mmol/L. 2,4,6-TH was 700 times as toxic as the parent benzoic acid (48 h EC 50 \u00bc 7.0 mmol/L) and about two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported for monohalogenated benzoic acid derivatives against D. magna. Within the subgroups based on the number of hydroxyl groups (N OH ), the toxicity variations due to the position of hydroxyl groups correlated with the logarithms of logP. The toxicity of benzoic acids could be expressed using simple linear and parabolic regression equations (Eqs. 1, 2).",

GA (Genetic Algorithm). Results: Modeling of cytochrome P450 2D6 is a particularly important target because this enzyme is involved in the oxidation of at least 50 drugs. Previously the authors have described the combined use of homology modeling and molecular docking in order to correctly position a range of substrates in the CYP2D6 active site with the known sites of metabolism above the heme. In this study, validation of the model of cytochrome P450 2D6 has been performed that can be used as an in silico tool for predicting metabolism and inhibition. The proposed docking approach identified correctly the site of metabolism of the atypical cytochrome P450 2D6 substrate, spirosulfonamide. The same method was employed to screen a small compound database of 33 compounds from the NCI database by docking it into the developed cytochrome P450 2D6 homology model using the program GOLD v2.0. Experimental IC 50 values for the 33 compounds were measured. The docked scored correlated with experimental IC 50 values with a regression coefficient of r 2 \u00bc 0.61 (q 2 \u00bc 0.59). Fig. 1 shows the plot of the experimental log(IC 50 ) values versus ChemScore values (kJ/mol) for each NCI compound for the best ranked docked solution. The method was able to discriminate between tight and weak binding compounds and correctly identified several novel inhibitors. It was suggested that the combination of homology modeling and molecular docking is a useful in silico tool for predicting cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition. The method is best used as a filter in a multifilter database screen. (cross-validated correlation coefficient). Results: The inhibitory activities of a series of indole/benzimidazole-5-carboxamidines of type I have been tested against trypsin-like serine proteases. CoMFA models were generated for the training set of the compounds in order to study their selectivity toward various trypsin-like serine proteases. The CoMFA models were established from the training set of 25 -29 molecules and validated by predicting the activities of 7 -8 test set molecules (protease, N opt , r 2 , r 2 cv , F, SEE, SEP, steric, electrostatic contributions): tPA, 7, 0. 987, 0.584, 224.8, 0.140, 0.809, 57.2, 42.8; fXa, 2, 0.811, 0.513, 47.3, 0.497, 0.798, 56.1, 43.9; thrombin, 3, 0.845, 0.504, 39.9, 54.5, 45.5; plasmin, 2, 0.822, 0.629, 57.8, 0.404, 0.583, 61.8, 38.2; trypsin, 2, 0.838, 0.583, 59.5, 0.348, 0.558, 58.2, 41.8 . Introduction of ClogP as an additional descriptor slightly deteriorated the statistical quality and predictive performance of the CoM-FA models. The validated CoMFA models were used to generate 3D steric and electrostatic fields contour maps, providing guidance toward possible modification of molecules for better selectivity and activity. Fig. 1 shows the CoMFA steric and electrostatic STDDEV*COEFF contour plots for trypsin inhibition (A polyhedron: sterically favored, B polyhedron: sterically disfavored, C polyhedron: negatively charge favored, D polyhedron: positively charge favored). The present 3D-QSAR studies reveals the selectivity trends of indole/benzimidazole-5-carboxamidines, which may be useful for designing novel selective serine protease inhibitors of therapeutic interest. In all the cases, the sterically fa- vorable green contours were in the vicinity of C-3 substitution and embedded in the 3'-phenyl ring, whereas in tPA they were observed next to the 3'-phenyl ring. The sterically disfavored yellow contours were observed in the vicinity of 3'phenyl ring of the compounds. The electrostatic contour plots displayed red polyhedron amid the 2'-OH and 3'-phenyl ring suggesting that increase in activity may be anticipated by moderate electronegative substitutions at 3 \u00c0 -position of 2phenyl ring, while moderate electropositive substituents at C-3, 2', 6-positions may enhance the tPA, fXa, plasmin and thrombin activity as shown by the presence of positively charge favored blue contours. It was corroborated that the nature of the substituent at C-6 position is the crucial factor in determining the selectivity trends of various serine protease inhibitors. It was found, that optimum low electron density substituent at C-6 may enhance the tPA and fXa activity as is indicated by the presence of the blue contour near 6-H of compound. Replacement of C-6 proton with a halogen (chloro) markedly decreased the tPA, fXa and thrombin inhibition, whereas no significant change was observed in case of plasmin and trypsin (compound 28 Data calculated: q 2 (cross-validated correlation coefficient). Results: The 3C-like proteinase of SARS is a key target for structure based drug design against SARS. In this study the substrate specificity of SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase has been investigated using the hydrolysis activities of 34 designed peptide substrates. The conserved core sequence of the native cleavage site was optimized for high hydrolysis activity. Residues at position P4, P3, and P3' are known to be critical for substrate recognition and binding, and enhancement of the b-sheet conformation tendency is also helpful. In addition, it was found that a salt bridge between position P3 and Glu 166 of the enzyme enhances the activity of the substrate. Using the enzymatic cleavage activity data a significant CoMFA model was derived (q 2 \u00bc 0.661, r 2 \u00bc 0.822, s \u00bc 0.429, F 2,20 \u00bc 46.2, steric and electrostatic contribution \u00bc 81.8% and 18.2%, respectively). Fig. 1 shows the superimposed 22 substrate structures and the contour plot of the CoMFA model indicating that increasing positive charge at position P3 is favored (A), and large hydrophobic residue at position P2 is favored (B) or unfavored (C), which is compatible with the crystal structure. Based on the mutation data and the predictive CoMFA model, a multiply mutated octapeptide S24 was designed for higher enzymatic cleavage activity. The hydrolysis activity of S24 was measured and found to be the highest among all designed substrates. The measured activity value (0.634 mM \u00c0 1 min \u00c0 1 ) was close to that predicted by CoMFA (0.58 mM \u00c0 1 min \u00c0 1 ). It was concluded that the developed model might be helpful for the research of the mechanism of substrate recognition of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase. (molecular modelling studies were carried out using SYBYL v6.8, implemented on an SGI Octane2 workstation, the most active molecule of the series was subjected to simulated annealing, the lowest energy conformer was selected and minimized using Tripos force field parameters and the Powell method, all the other molecules were built from the template molecule, partial atomic charges were calculated using Gasteiger-H\u00fcckel charges); CoMSIA",

Chemical descriptors: MW [molecular weight (g/mol)]; NRB (number of rotable bonds); HBD, HBA (number of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor centres, respectively). Results: In this study a CoMSIA analysis of nonpeptidic 1,2-naphthoquinone as derivatives of type I as potential PTP1B inhibitors was performed. The compound set was subjected to property filters and segregated into training and test set. The most active molecule was subjected to simulated annealing dynamics method and the lowest energy conformer was minimized again and considered as the bioactive conformation. Database-inertial alignment using the selected template molecule was utilized for aligning the molecules. Several CoMSIA analyses were performed to obtain the best mod-el. The statistical parameters of the best CoMSIA model were the following: n \u00bc 25 training set an 9 test set molecules, r 2 cv \u00bc 0. Fig. 1 shows the CoMSIA contour map of the H-bond acceptor field contributions around Ia, where A and B areas represent H-bond acceptor favored and disfavored areas, respectively. As the crystal structure of PTP1B-naphthoquinone derivative is not known, the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor fields of this CoMSIA study indicate the probable H-bond sites on the enzyme for explaining the interaction between this class of compounds and the protein.

All ligands produced a decrease of adenylate cyclase activity, indicative of their inverse agonism. 3D QSAR analyses of a set of 22 inverse agonists yielded a pharmacophore model and a CoMFA model (R 2 \u00bc 0.97, q 2 \u00bc 0.64, SE \u00bc 0.18). The correlation coefficient between predicted and experimental pK i values was 0.987. Fig. 1 shows the developed pharmacophore model for 5-HT7 inverse agonism and 5-HT7 receptor agonism. Fig. 1 The pharmacophore model shows similarities with recently published pharmacophore models for 5-HT7 receptor agonism and antagonism. Docking of inverse agonists at the binding site of a model of the helical parts of the 5-HT7 receptor revealed interesting molecular interactions and a possible explanation for observed structure-activity relationships. Fig. 2 shows the close-up of molecular interactions between Ib and the binding site of the 5-HT7 receptor, where nonessential hydrogen atoms have been omitted. In case of the 5-HT7 receptor, it was indicated that agonists and inverse agonists occupy the same binding site, but additional pharmacophoric features induce different conformational changes of the receptor resulting in activation by agonists and deactivation by inverse agonists.

Data calculated: q 2 (cross-validated correlation coefficient). Results: A 3D-QSAR CoMFA study of piperidine-based analogues of cocaine with flexible 3R-substituents has been performed in order to explore the binding mode of the 3asubstituent of the piperidine ring using pharmacophore-based flexible alignment. A set of three different GASP pharmacophore models were generated based on three representative sets of compounds of types I -III. The flexible superposition of all studied compounds was performed for each pharmacophore model using the FlexS algorithm, all sets of the overlaid structures with the top-ranked conformers were used for CoMFA modeling. Compared with the initial models, the conventional correlation coefficients r 2 for the optimized models 1 and 2 were improved from 0.90 and 0.837 to 0.997 and 0.993, respectively. The LOO coefficients q 2 for the optimized models 1 and 2 were improved from 0.515 and 0.296 to 0.828 and 0.849, respectively. The results of the two CoMFA models suggest that both steric and electrostatic interactions play important roles in the binding of the 3R-substituents of the piperidine-based analogues of cocaine. The contributions from steric and electrostatic molecular fields for model 1 were 0.621 and 0.379, respectively. The contributions from steric and electrostatic fields for model 2 were 0.493 and 0.507, respectively. The two highly predictive CoMFA models indicate that the 3R-substituent has two possible binding modes at the DAT. The fact that two distinct models were obtained indicates that the 3R-substituent may adopt multiple binding modes. Fig. 1 a shows the CoMFA contour maps of optimized model 1, in the electrostatic contour map, greater affinity is correlated with more positive charge near A fields and more negative charge near other contour; in the steric contour map Fig. 1 b greater affinity is correlated with more bulky groups near A contours and less bulky groups near B contour. The CoMFA contour maps provided a visual representation of the putative binding modes of the 3R-substituent of the piperidine-based analogues of cocaine and can be applied to design novel DAT inhibitors that may be useful for the treatment of cocaine abuse and certain neurological disorders.

The pharmacophore model contains features shared by a wide range of general CDK inhibitors, as well as features that appear to be Pfmrkspecific. Despite the complexity of P. falciparum CDK activity, the predicted Pfmrk inhibition from the derived pharmacophore model was robust.

Sterically favorable molecular fields were observed at the 3-and 4-positions of the benzene (B-ring) next to the t-butyl group, and a sterically unfavorable field was evidenced at the 2-position. Another sterically unfavorable field surrounding the favorable field observed at the 4-position of the B-ring. Electrostatically negative fields were observed near the C \u00bc O moiety, above the benzene ring, and at the 4-position of the B-ring. The optimum hydrophobicity of compounds in terms of logP was calculated to be 4.1. The results of the 3D SAR analyses were consistent with those obtained from the previously reported classical QSAR for 2-chlorobenzoyl analogs containing diverse para-substituents. The high activity of potent insecticides such as tebufenozide and chromafenozide could be rationalized by the derived CoMFA model. It was suggested that the CoMFA method is a useful tool in the design of novel compounds and in understanding the structural details and mechanism of the ligand-receptor interactions.

Computational methods: TRAP (Target Related Affinity Profiling technology characterizes small molecules by their affinities to a panel of proteins, a compounds set of binding affinities to this panel, its affinity fingerprint, is the descriptor used to construct computational models for activity against a particular therapeutic target, the TRAP algorithms select compounds for testing on the basis of the spatial relationships among active, inactive, and untested molecules in this 12-dimensional space, affinity fingerprints are not constructed from chemical structure; thus, they are naturally suited for finding novel chemical entities); PCA (Principal Component Analysis). Results: COX-1 is a membrane-bound enzyme responsible for the oxidation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. An affinity fingerprint model (TRAP) has been constructed for COX-1 inhibition using known nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The TRAP model was used to search for compounds from a chemical library for assay against COX-1. In the second round the TRAP model was refined by including 16 compounds that were found to be inactive against COX-1. Novel COX-1 inhibitors were discovered using the affinity fingerprints of 19 known NSAIDs. Three molecules were found that were in terms of IC 50 values more potent than ibuprofen, a commonly used COX-1 inhibitor. These compounds were structurally distinct from those used to build the model and were discovered by testing only 62 library compounds. Fig. 1 shows the spatial relationships among the 19 NSAIDs (full circles), the 16 inactive compounds identified in the first round of compound selections (open circles), and the 3 active molecules (asterisks) identified in the second round of compound selections, in the two dimensions most important in selecting the compounds in the second round (as determined by principal components analysis). The two active molecules in the lower-right-hand corner were selected by the interpolation model, while the active molecule in the upper left was chosen by the nearest-neighbor algorithm. The proposed method provides an alternative approach to extensive screening. The discovery of these novel lead compounds demonstrated the efficiency of the use of affinity fingerprints for identifying novel bioactive chemotypes from known drugs. The use of affinity fingerprints of known drugs as a starting point for compound selection is novel.

A virtual screening of about 160,000 commercially available compounds against the X-ray crystallographic structure of AChE has been performed yielding novel, promising AChE inhibitors. Among 114 compounds that could be purchased and assayed, 35 molecules with various core structures showed inhibitory activities with IC 50 values below 100mM. Thirteen compounds displayed IC 50 values between 0.5 and 10mM, and almost all their core structures were very different from those of known inhibitors. Fig. 1 shows the docking model of one of the identified AChE inhibitors of type I (thick lines), together with the complex crystal structures of the known inhibitor decamethonium (thick and dark lines) (hydrogens in the protein are omitted for clarity). The results demonstrated the effectiveness and validity of the proposed ADAM&EVE approach and proved to be a useful tool for the development of novel drugs to treat Alzheimers disease.

Results: The family of GPCRs represents one of the most relevant target families in small-molecule drug design. In this study a successful virtual screening for a submicromolar antagonist of the neurokinin-1 receptor has been performed based on a ligand-supported homology model of the NK1 receptor based on the high-resolution X-ray structure of rhodopsin. The homology model of the NK1 receptor has been generated using the novel MOBILE approach developed by the authors. For the building the NK1 receptor, the antagonist CP-96345 was used to restrain the modeling. The quality of the derived model was tested by exploring its ability to accommodate known NK1 antagonists from structurally diverse chemical classes. On the basis of the generated model and its interaction with known NK1 antagonists a pharmacophore model was derived which guided the 2D and 3D database search with UNITY. In a following step, the selected hits were docked into the modeled binding pocket of the NK1 receptor. Finally, seven ligands were selected for biochemical testing, yielding one compound (ASN-1377642) displaying affinity in the submicromolar range. Fig. 1 shows the structurebased pharmacophore hypothesis, with the docked ASN-1377642, where the H-bond interaction between the NH 2 of the terminal amide group of Gln 165 (light ball) sphere) and a corresponding H-bond acceptor (black ball in the middle) is considered essential for all NK1 antagonists, and the sites for aromatic moieties within the aromatic ring are indicated by large spheres. The H-bond formed with Gln 165 was found to be an important binding determinant. It was suggested that ligand-supported homology models of GPCRs may be used as effective tools for structure-based drug design. (B. B.)",

The derived Catalyst model has been validated by using a set of 38 flavonoids with varying affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor and has been used as a search query in databases to find novel lead compounds. Fig. 1 shows the compound of type II mapped to the Catalyst pharmacophore with two hydrogen bond acceptors (A), one hydrogen bond donor (B) and two hydrophobic features (C), shape (D) and five exclusion spheres (E). Five of the hits from the database searching were tested against the GABA A receptor. Two of the compounds displayed K i values in the lower milimolar range. The compound showing the highest potency in-vitro showed an affinity of 121 nM, a viable candidate for further optimization. The false positive ligands with K i > 10 mM affinities have been analysed in terms of conformational energy penalties and possibilities for hydrogen bond interactions. The pharmacophore has been validated by identifying active compounds with a core structure different from the compounds used to generate the pharmacophore. Post-processing of the Catalyst hits in terms of hydrogen bond distances to hydrogen bonding pharmacophore elements in the search query is shown to be an efficient way of focusing the hit list. Compounds: a) Mepyramine of type I and structurally analogous H1 antagonists: desloratidine, loratidine, chlorpheniramine, tripolidine, tripelennamine, chlorcyclizine, chloropyramine, diphenhydramine; b) 9 Tricyclic H1 antagonists: phenothiazine, doxepin, loratadine, promethazine, olopatadine, desloratadine, chlropromazine, epinastine, ketotifen; c) 4 Zwitterionic H1 antagonists: acrivastine of type II, cetirizine, fexofenadine, olopatidine;",

Computational methods: Molecular modeling [comparative sequence analysis between HHR1 and bovine rhodopsin was performed using the program Clustal W the automatic sequence alignment was followed by manual adjustment, six initial HHR1 models were built by MODELLER v4 using the derived sequence alignment and the bovine rhodopsin crystal structure, the main geometric parameters of the models were determined by PRO-CHECK, one model was chosen for further investigations, which possessed on average the most favourable features, the selected model was subjected to a series of tests for its internal consistency and reliability, backbone conformation was evaluated by the inspection of the Psi/ Phi Ramachandran plot obtained from PRO-CHECK analysis, the PROSA test was applied to check for energy criteria in comparison with the potential of mean force derived from a large set of known protein structures, packing quality of the homology model was investigated by the calculation of WHATIF Quality Control value, the derived homology model of HHR1 was used for docking antagonists into the binding site suggested by site-directed mu-tagenesis studies, the channel surfaces of the receptor model were identified using the Multi Channel Surfaces module as implemented in Sybyl v6.9 with a 1.4 A probe radius, a considerable cavity was found in the TM region of the receptor, in close proximity to the conserved Asp 107 , which was supposed to be one of the most crucial residues of the ligand binding in HHR1, all docking calculations were performed by the genetic algorithm based flexible docking code, FlexiDock as implemented in Sybyl 6.9, varying the parameters of the GA program a high diversity of sampled configuration of genes was obtained allowing sufficient sampling of the conformational space available for ligands within the binding site]; GA (Genetic Algorithm is a stochastic optimization method that mimics the process of evolution by manipulating a collection of data structures called chromosomes). Data calculated: pK a (negative logarithm of the acidic dissociation constant of acrivastine were calculated by CompuDrugs Pallas v3.1 software). Results: The H1 receptor is mainly responsible for the inflammatory effect of histamine, therefore, it is an attractive target for developing drugs against allergic rhinitis. In this study, homology modelling and binding site mapping of the human histamine H1 receptor has been performed using the high resolution structure of bovine rhodopsin as template. GA based docking calculations were employed to identify the role of several amino acid residues in the binding site involved in agonist or antagonist binding. Binding mode analyses of mepyramine, desloratidine, loratidine and acrivastine as ligands were carried out in order to rationalize their binding affinity. The binding site mapping established seven new potential aromatic interaction points Tyr 108 , Phe 184 , Phe 190 , Phe 199 , Phe 424 , Trp 428 , Tyr 431 forming the lipophilic pocket of the antagonist binding pocket. (the residues Asp 107 , Trp 158 , Lys 191 , Phe 432 , Phe 435 had been shown previously to play a role in antagonist binding). Fig. 1 shows the binding mode of mepyramine within the active site of HHR1. Residues that are important in forming the active site are dark band and label-led.

Results: QSAR analysis of the AR inhibitory activity of type I compounds has been performed. The published assay data of 30 training compounds are related only for the racemic mixtures. As the physicochemical descriptors for the QSAR analysis were calculated for each of the (R)-enantiomers and (S)-enantiomers, a new \"racemic\" descriptor was devised as the arithmetic mean of the (R)-enantiomer descriptor and the (S)-enantiomer descriptor (RS-descriptor). The RS-equation was superior to its R-and S-counterparts in predicting the inhibitory activity of optically pure enantiomers as well as racemic mixtures. The RS-equation displayed larger regression coefficients with relatively small number of less intercorrelating terms than R-and S-equations. The five term RS-equation showed the following statistical parameters: n \u00bc 27, r \u00bc 0.930, q 2 \u00bc 0.746, s \u00bc 0.144, F \u00bc 25.7, LOF \u00bc 0.349. Fig. 1 shows the observed versus predicted activities of the compounds calculated using the five term RS-equation containing V NCOS , TASA, DPSA 1 , m x , S 2 y terms as descriptors. The RS-equation revealed that the hydrophobic character of the benzyl moiety is the major contributing factor to the AR inhibitory activity. The contribution is governed by the polar descriptors, DPSA1 and m x . The equation also indicates that the bulky substitution at the R2 or R3 position is unfavorable for the inhibitory activity. The racemic QSAR model revealed that the hydrophobic character of the benzyl moiety was the major contributing factor to the AR reductase inhibi-tory activity and the polar surface area descriptors modulate the AR inhibitory activity. It was concluded that for AR inhibitors the RS-descriptors are suitable to perform QSAR analysis of the activity data assayed with racemates. Data determined: IC 50 [concentrations of the test substance (mM) required for 50% inhibition of pol.a, pol.b, and human topoisomerase II]. Results: The triterpenoid structure is an attractive pharmacological target for the molecular design of DNA polymerase inhibitors. In this study, molecular design of cholesterols as inhibitors of DNA polymerase r has been performed. Among the tested 12 cholesterols the compounds of I -IV were shown to selectively affect only pol.a. As to the structural features, the presence of a carboxyl group at position 28 appeared to be essential for the inhibition of the pol.a activity acting by competing with the template-primer DNA and noncompetitively with the substrate. The relationships between the size/shape of active cholesterol analogues and the template-primer DNA-binding site of pol.a have been elucidated. In pol.b, LCA appears to be inserted into the pocket region comprising three amino acid residues (Lys 60 , Leu 77 , Fig. 1 and Thr 79 ). The size and the shape of LCA (12.43 \u00c2 11.35 \u00c2 4.83 ), as shown in Fig. 1 , exactly fit the three dimensions of the \"a three-point interaction\" between the small molecules and the pocket surface. Although the 3D structure of pol.a is still unknown, it is thought to have such pocket for LCA interaction. Since the active compounds II-IV were almost same size (19 \u00c2 12 \u00c2 8 ) (Fig. 1) , the template-primer DNA-binding site of pol.a may also have \"a three-point interaction\" on the compound interactive surface. If so, the pocket in pol.a is larger to fit the size, 19 \u00c2 12 \u00c2 8 , than that in pol.b for LCA. The hydrophobic region (i.e., the backbone) and the hydrophilic region (i.e., carboxyl group or ketone group) in LCA are thought to bind to the hydrophobic sheet and the hydrophilic amino acids in the template-primer DNA-binding site of pol.b, respectively. The binding mode between the cholesterol and pol.a may be same as for the pol.b-LCA complex. The carboxyl group at position 28 appears to bind to the hydrophilic region in the pocket holding cholestrols on pol.a. Systematic studies using triterpenoid derivatives may facilitate the molecular design of inhibitors and the understanding of the mechanism on a molecular level, which eventually lead to the development of an anti-cancer agent. [force fields were validated by a comparison of the energetic ordering of the minimum energy structures on the AMBER*/GBSA(water), OPLSAA/GBSA(water) and HF/6-311G**/ SCRF(water) surfaces]; Conformational searches [Low Mode:Monte Carlo (LM:MC) conformational search method was employed to generate conformational ensembles using MacroModel v7.2 suite of programs running on 800 MHz Athlon PCs under the RedHat LINUX 6.2 operating system, quantum calculations were performed with Jaguar v4.0 program, the LM : MC search method was employed in a 1 : 1 combination with the Monte Carlo (MC) search method to explore the potential energy surfaces of the stereoisomers of type I, each MC conformational search step varied a random number of torsional degrees of freedom between a minimum of two and a maximum of fourteen, where fourteen is the total number of variable torsion angles as shown in Fig. 1 , LM frequencies corresponding to the 10 lowest eigenvectors were explored interconversion of ring structures was enabled using the ringopening method of Still, starting structure chirality was preserved throughout the conformational searching, during the conformational search all structures were subjected to 1500 steps of the Truncated Newton Conjugate Gradient minimization method, ensembles generated for each of the 10 stereoisomers were grouped into geometrically similar families using the XCluster 80 program calculating the pairwise distance between each structure, in either torsional or Cartesian space, and partitioned the conformations into geometrically similar subsets in an agglomerative, hierarchical fashion]. Results: The conformational flexibility of a series of diastereomeric cyclic urea HIV-1 inhibitors was compared using the LM:MC conformational search method. It was found that the energetic ordering of the minima on the OPLSAA/ GBSA(water) surface was in better agreement with the quantum calculations than the ordering on the AMBER*/GBSA (water) surface. An ensemble of low energy structures was generated using OPLSAA/GBSA(water) and applied to compare the molecular shape and flexibility of each diastereomer to the experimentally determined binding affinities and crystal structures of closely related systems. The diastereomeric solution-phase energetic stability, conformational rigidity and ability to adopt a chair conformation correlated significantly with experimental binding affinities. Rigid body docking indicated that all of the diastereomers adopted solution-phase conformations suitable for alignment with the HIV PR, and inhibitors with higher binding affinities (RSSR, RSRR and RSRR) were more precisely oriented for optimal interaction than inhibitors with low binding affinities (RSRS, RRRR and RRSS). Fig. 2 shows representative structures of the two conformational families of RSRR. The LM : MC conformational search method was capable to exhaustively search the OPLSAA/GBSA(water) surface and to identify the ensemble of all low lying structures of a series of diastereomeric cyclic urea HIV PR inhibitors. Analysis of each ensemble indicated that inhibitors with higher binding affinities were generally more rigid and were in the proper shape for optimal interaction with the protease active site. The ability to adopt a chair conformation encouraged ring substituents to adopt optimal binding orientations. The solvation free energy, as approximated by the GBSA energies, did not correlate to the binding affinity. The study indicated that N substitution plays an important role in orienting the substituents for optimal interaction with the active site. (B. B.) inhibition constants (R 2 \u00bc 0.89). LOO cross-validation indicated high predictive power (q 2 \u00bc 0.72), and analysis of a separate 16-compound test set also yielded very good correlation with experiment (R 2 \u00bc 0.69). Fig. 1 shows the plot of the predicted versus observed pIC 50 values for the training set. Scoring function analysis allowed the identification and characterization of important ligand-receptor interactions. A list of those residues has been produced that made the most important electrostatic and VDW contributions within the main active site, gorge area, acyl binding pocket, and peripheral site. The results of these analyses were consistent with X-ray crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis studies. Comparison with other scoring methods and consensus scoring indicated the high effectiveness and predictability of this method. (B. B.) ",

Computational methods: Molecular modeling [protein modeling and docking was performed in Sybyl environment, geometry optimizations were carried out in MOE using the MMFF94 force field, a genetic algorithm (GA) was used in searching the binding conformation of flexible ligands, using the default parameters in GOLD, the scoring methods included empirical methods such as ChemScore, FlexXscore, and G Score, and knowledge based methods such as PMF score and DrugScore, MLR was used to obtain a consensus score from these methods, the selected conformations were used to fit an interaction field whose form, basically a variant of the comparative binding energy (COMBINE) method, the statistic analysis was performed using PLS analysis]; GOLD[flexible protein-ligand docking program featuring a (i) genetic algorithm methodology for protein docking; (ii) full ligand and partial protein flexibility; (iii) energy functions partly based on conformation and non-bonded contact information from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)].

Results: Inhibition of AChE is an important research topic because of its wide range of associated health implications. In this study a receptor-specific docking score function has been developed for estimating ligand-protein interactions and applied to the study of hAChE inhibition. The proposed method utilizes a statistically trained weighted sum of electrostatic and van der Waals (VDW) interactions between ligands and receptor residues. The consensus score was built over the 53molecule set, yielding a weighted sum over five commercially available scoring functions (Eq. 1), pIC 50 \u00bc 0.05682 Chemscore \u00c0 0.00499 Drugscore \u00c0 0.03582 Flexscore \u00c0 0.01232 PMFscore \u00fe 7.62820 1)where Chemscore, Drugscore, Flexscore, Gscore, and PMFscore refer to computed affinities from the Chem-Score, DrugScore, FlexX score, G Score, and PMF score methods, respectively.
