Weather characteristics 2 weeks prior are used as instrumental variables for causal inference. Stringent quarantines, city lockdowns, and local public health measures imposed in late January significantly decreased the virus transmission rate. The virus spread was contained by the middle of February. Population outflow from the outbreak source region posed a higher risk to the destination regions than other factors, including geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. We quantify the effects of different public health measures in reducing the number of infections through counterfactual analyses. Over 1.4 million infections and 56,000 deaths may have been avoided as a result of the national and provincial public health measures imposed in late January in China.",

Several clusters of patients with similar pneumonia were reported through late December 2019. The pneumonia was later identified to be caused by a new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) (Zhu et al. 2020), later named Coronavirus Disease 2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO). 1 While the seafood market was closed on January 1, 2020, a massive outflow of travelers during the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush (Chunyun) in mid-January 2 led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout China and to other countries. The first confirmed case outside Wuhan in China was reported in Shenzhen on January 19 ). As of April 5, over 1.2 million confirmed cases were reported in at least 200 countries or territories. 3 Two fundamental strategies have been taken globally, one focused on mitigating but not necessarily stopping the virus spread and the other relying on more stringent measures to suppress and reverse the growth trajectories. While most Western countries initially implemented the former strategy, more and more of them (including most European countries and the USA) have since shifted towards the more stringent suppression strategy, and some other countries such as China, Singapore, and South Korea have adopted the latter strategy from the beginning. In particular, China has rolled out one of the most stringent public health strategies. That strategy involves city lockdowns and mandatory quarantines to ban or restrict traffic since January 23, social distance-encouraging strategies since January 28, and a centralized treatment and isolation strategy since February 2.",

By comparing the estimates before and after February 2, we examine whether the comprehensive set of policies at the national scale delays the spread of COVID-19.

First, the number of people infected by a disease usually first increases, reaches a peak, and then drops. Second, there are persistent, unobservable variables, such as clusters that generate large numbers of infections, people's living habits, and government policies. Serial correlations in errors give rise to correlations between the lagged numbers of cases and the error term, rendering the ordinary least square (OLS) estimator biased. Combining insights in Adda (2016) , the existing knowledge of the incubation period of COVID-19 (World Health Organization 2020b) , and data on weather conditions that affect the transmission rates of COVID-19 (Lowen and Steel 2014; Wang et al. 2020b ), we construct instrumental variables for the number of new COVID-19 cases during the preceding 2 weeks. Weather characteristics in the previous third and fourth weeks do not directly affect the number of new COVID-19 cases after controlling for the number of new COVID-19 cases and weather conditions in the preceding first and second weeks. Therefore, our estimated impacts have causal interpretations and reflect population transmission rates.",

We examine whether population flows from the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak, which is a major city and an important transportation hub in central China, can explain the spread of the virus using data on real-time travel intensity between cities that have recently become available for research. Realizing the urgency of forestalling widespread community transmissions in areas that had not seen many infections, in late January, many Chinese cities implemented public health measures that encourage social distancing.

Given the short time period since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, research is urgently needed to assess the dynamics of transmissions and the implications for how the COVID-19 outbreak will evolve (Wu et al. 2020b, c) . Liu et al. (2020) identify 12 studies that estimated the basic reproductive number in the wide range of 1.4 to 6.5 (with a mean of 3.28 and a median of 2.79) for Wuhan, Hubei, China, or overseas during January 1 through January 28, 2020. 4 Our R 0 estimate relies on spatially disaggregated data during an extended period (until February 29, 2020) to mitigate potential biases, and the instrumental variable approach we use isolates the causal effect of virus transmissions and imposes fewer restrictions on the relationship between the unobserved determinants of new cases and the number of cases in the past. Simultaneously considering a more comprehensive set of factors in the model that may influence virus spread, we find that one case generates 2.992 more cases within 2 weeks (1.876 if cities in Hubei province are excluded) in the sub-sample from January 19 to February 1. In the sub-sample from February 2 to February 29, the transmission rates fall to 1.243 (0.614 excluding Hubei province). Our estimate of R 0 for the period in late January 2020 that overlaps with existing studies falls well within the range of the estimated R 0 in the emerging COVID-19 literature .",

Through a set of policy simulations, we report initial evidence on the number of avoided infections through the end of February 2020 for cities outside Hubei province. Specifically, the stringent health policies at the national and provincial levels reduced the transmission rate and resulted in 1,408,479 (95% CI, 815,585 to 2,001,373) fewer infections and poten-tially 56,339 fewer deaths. 5 In contrast, the effects of the Wuhan lockdown and local non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are considerably smaller. As a result of the Wuhan lockdown, closed management of communities, and family outdoor restrictions, 31,071 (95% CI, 8296 to 53,845), 3803 (95% CI, 1142 to 6465), and 2703 (95% CI, 654 to 4751) fewer cases were avoided, respectively. These three policies may respectively avoid 1,243 deaths, 152 deaths, and 108 deaths. Making some additional assumptions, such as the value of statistical life and lost productive time, these estimates may provide the basis for more rigorous cost-benefit analysis regarding relevant public health measures. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the empirical model. Section 3 discusses our data and the construction of key variables. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 documents the public health measures implemented in China, whose impacts are quantified in a series of counterfactual exercises. Section 6 concludes. The Appendix contains additional details on the instrumental variables, data quality, and the computation of counterfactuals.",

            "text": "Our analysis sample includes 304 prefecture-level cities in China. We exclude Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, from our analysis for two reasons. First, the epidemic patterns in Wuhan are significantly different from those in other cities. Some confirmed cases in Wuhan contracted the virus through direct exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is the most probable origin of the virus 6 . In other cities, infections arise from human-to-human transmissions. Second, COVID-19 cases were still pneumonia of previously unknown virus infections in people's perception until early January so that Wuhan's health care system became overwhelmed as the number of new confirmed cases increased exponentially since mid-January. This may have caused severe delay and measurement errors in the number of cases reported in Wuhan, and to a lesser extent, in other cities in Hubei province. To alleviate this concern, we also conduct analyses excluding all cities in Hubei province from our sample. 5 We assume a case fatality rate of 4%, the same as China's current average level. Of course, the eventual case fatality rate may be different from the current value, and it depends on many key factors, such as the preparedness of health care systems and the demographic structure of the population outside Hubei province in comparison to China as a whole. Also importantly, among patients who have died from COVID-19, the time from symptom onset to outcome ranges from 2 to 8 weeks (World Health Organization 2020b), which is partially beyond the time window of this analysis. Therefore, we defer more rigorous estimates about avoided fatality to future studies. 6 document the exposure history of the first 425 cases. It is suspected that the initial cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.",

The unobserved determinants of new infections such as local residents' and government's preparedness are likely correlated over time, which causes correlations between the error term and the lagged dependent variables. As noted by the World Health Organization (2020b), most cases that were locally generated outside Hubei occurred in households or clusters. The fact that big clusters give rise to a large number of cases within a short period of time may still be compatible with a general low rate of community transmissions, especially when measures such as social distancing are implemented. Therefore, the coefficients are estimated by two-stage least squares in order to obtain consistent estimates on the transmission rates in the population.",

Detailed discussion of the selection of weather characteristics as instruments is in Section 3.2. The timeline of key variables are displayed in Fig. 1 . The primary assumption on the instrumental variables is that weather conditions before 2 weeks do not affect the likelihood that a person susceptible to the virus contracts the disease, conditional on weather conditions and the number of infectious people within the 2-week window. On the other hand, they affect the number of other persons who have become infectious within the 2-week window, because they may have contracted the virus earlier than 2 weeks. These weather variables are exogenous to the error term and Another objective of this paper is to quantify the effect of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the transmission rates of the virus, which may identify potential behavioral and socioeconomic risk factors for infections. For within-city transmissions, we consider the effects of local public health measures (see Section 5 for details) and the mediating effects of population density, level of economic development, number of doctors, and environmental factors such as temperature, wind, and precipitation. For between-city transmissions, apart from proximity measures based on geographic distance, we also consider similarity in population density and the level of economic development. To measure the spread of the virus from Wuhan, we also include the number of people traveling from Wuhan. The full empirical model is as follows:",

All these data are reported by 32 provincial-level Health Commissions in China 10 . Figure 2 shows the time patterns of daily confirmed new cases in Wuhan, in Hubei province outside Wuhan, and in non-Hubei provinces of mainland China. Because Hubei province started to include clinically diagnosed cases into new confirmed cases on February 12, we notice a spike in the number of new cases in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province on this day (Fig. 2) . The common effects of such changes in case definitions on other cities can be absorbed by time fixed effects. As robustness checks, we re-estimate models A and B without the cities in Hubei province. In addition, since the number of clinically diagnosed cases at the city level was reported for the days of February 12, 13, and 14, we recalculated the daily number of new cases for the 3 days by removing the clinically diagnosed cases from our data and re-estimate models A and B. Our main findings still hold (Appendix B). Regarding the explanatory variables, we calculate the number of new cases of COVID-19 in the preceding first and second weeks for each city on each day. To estimate the impacts of new COVID-19 cases in other cities, we first calculate the geographic distance between a city and all other cities using the latitudes and longitudes of the centroids of each city and then calculate the weighted sum of the number Since the COVID-19 outbreak started from Wuhan, we also calculate the weighted number of COVID-19 new cases in Wuhan using the inverse of log distance as the weight. Furthermore, to explore the mediating impact of population flow from Wuhan, we collect the daily population flow index from Baidu that proxies for the total intensity of migration from Wuhan to other cities 11 . Figure 3 plots the Baidu index of population flow out of Wuhan and compares its values this year with those in 2019. We then interact the flow index with the share that a destination city takes (Fig. 4) to construct a measure on the population flow from Wuhan to a destination city. Other mediating variables include population density, GDP per capita, and the number of doctors at the city level, which we collect from the most recent China city statistical yearbook. Table 1 presents the summary statistics of these variables. On average, GDP per capita and population density are larger in cities outside Hubei province than those in Hubei. Compared with cities in Hubei province, cities outside Hubei have more doctors.",

To merge the meteorological variables with the number of new cases of COVID-19, we first calculate daily weather variables for each city on each day from 2019 December to 2020 February from station-level weather records following the inverse distance weighting method. Specifically, for each city, we draw a circle of 100 km from the city's centroid and calculate the weighted average daily weather variables using stations within the 100-km circle 12 .

Human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 is mostly through droplets and contacts (National Health Commission of the PRC 2020). Weather conditions such as rainfall, wind speed, and temperature may shape infections via their influences on social activities and virus transmissions. For instance, increased precipitation 11 Baidu migration (https://qianxi.baidu.com). 12 The 100-km circle is consistent with the existing literature. Most studies on the socioeconomic impacts of climate change have found that estimation results are insensitive to the choice of the cutoff distance (Zhang et al. 2017) . transmissions. In addition, increased rainfall and lower temperature may also reduce social activities. Newly confirmed COVID-19 cases typically arise from contracting the virus within 2 weeks in the past (e.g., World Health Organization 2020b). The extent of human-to-human transmission is determined by the number of people who have already contracted the virus and the environmental conditions within the next 2 weeks. Conditional on the number of people who are infectious and environmental conditions in the previous first and second weeks, it is plausible that weather conditions further in the past, i.e., in the previous third and fourth weeks, should not directly affect the number of current new cases. Based on the existing literature, we select weather characteristics as the instrumental variables, which include daily maximum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and the interaction between precipitation and wind speed. We then regress the endogenous variables on the instrumental variables, contemporaneous weather controls, city, date, and city by week fixed effects. Table 2 shows that F-tests on the coefficients of the instrumental variables all reject joint insignificance, which confirms that overall the selected instrumental variables are not weak. The coefficients of the first stage regressions are reported in Table 9 in the appendix. This table reports the F -tests on the joint significance of the coefficients on the instrumental variables (IV) that are excluded from the estimation equations. Our IV include weekly averages of daily maximum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and the interaction between precipitation and wind speed, during the preceding third and fourth weeks, and the averages of these variables in other cities weighted by the inverse of log distance. For each F statistic, the variable in the corresponding row is the dependent variable, and the time window in the corresponding column indicates the time span of the sample. Each regression also includes 1-and 2-week lags of these weather variables, weekly averages of new infections in the preceding first and second weeks in Wuhan which are interacted with the inverse log distance or the population flow, and city, date and city by week fixed effects. Coefficients on the instrumental variables for the full sample are reported in Table 15 in the appendix We also need additional weather variables to instrument the adoption of public health measures at the city level. Since there is no theoretical guidance from the existing literature, we implement the Cluster-Lasso method of Belloni et al. (2016) and Ahrens et al.

It is also during these 2 weeks that the Chinese government took actions swiftly to curtail the virus transmission. On January 20, COVID-19 was classified as a class B statutory infectious disease and treated as a class A statutory infectious disease. The city of Wuhan was placed under lockdown on January 23; roads were closed, and residents were not allowed to leave the city. Many other cities also imposed public policies ranging from canceling public events and stopping public transportation to limiting how often residents could leave home.

In model B, we estimate the effects of the average number of new cases in the past 14 days instead of using two separate lag variables. Table 3 reports the estimation results of the OLS and IV regressions of Eq. 2, in which only within-city transmission is considered. After controlling for time-invariant city fixed effects and time effects that are common to all cities, on average, one new infection leads to 1.142 more cases in the next week, but 0.824 fewer cases 1 week later. The negative effect can be attributed to the fact that both local authorities and residents would have taken more protective measures in response to a higher perceived risk of contracting the virus given more time. Information disclosure on newly confirmed cases at the daily level by official media and information dissemination on social media throughout China may have promoted more timely actions by the public, resulting in slower virus transmissions.

In addition, geographic proximity may not fully describe the level of social interactions between residents in Wuhan and other cities since the lockdown in Wuhan on January 23 significantly reduced the population flow from Wuhan to other cities. To alleviate this concern, we also use a measure of the size of population flow from Wuhan to a destination city, which is constructed by multiplying the daily migration index on the population flow out of Wuhan (Fig 3) with the share of the flow that a destination city receives provided by Baidu (Fig. 4) .

Besides, the transmission rate displays a slight increase beginning around February 4, which corresponds to the return travels and work resumption after Chinese Spring Festival, but eventually decreases at around February 12. Such decrease may be partly attributed to the social distancing strategies at the city level, so we examine the impacts of relevant policies in Section 5. Moreover, the transmission rates in cities outside Hubei province have been kept at low levels throughout the whole sample period (columns (4) and (6) of Table 5 ). These results suggest that the policies adopted at the national and provincial levels soon after January 19 prevented cities outside Hubei from becoming new hotspots of infections.

Regarding between-city transmissions, we consider the mediating effects of distance, difference in population density, and difference in GDP per capita since cities that are similar in density or economic development level may be more closely linked. We also include a measure of population flows from Wuhan. Table 6 reports the estimation results of the IV regressions. To ease the comparison across various moderators, for the mediating variables of within-city transmissions that are significant at 10%, we compute the changes in the variables so that the effect of new confirmed infections in the past 14 days on current new confirmed cases is reduced by 1 (columns (2) and (4)). 15 It is estimated that 14,925,000 people traveled out of Wuhan in 2019 during the Lunar New Year holiday (http://www.whtv.com.cn/p/17571.html).

In the second sub-sample, these effects become insignificant probably because public health measures and inter-city resource sharing take effects. In fact, cities with higher population density have lower transmission rates in the second sub-sample. Regarding the environmental factors, we notice different significant mediating variables across the first and second sub-samples. The transmission rates are lower with adverse weather conditions, lower temperature, or less rain. Further research is needed to identify clear mechanisms. In addition, population flow from Wuhan still poses a risk of new infections for other cities even after we account for the above mediating effects on own-city transmission. This effect is robust to the inclusion of the proximity measures based on economic similarity and geographic proximity between Wuhan and other cities. Nevertheless, we do not find much evidence on between-city transmissions among cities other than Wuhan.",

The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council was established on January 20, and the Central Leadership Group for Epidemic Response was established on January 25. On January 23, National Healthcare Security Administration announced that expenses related to COVID-19 treatments would be covered by the medical insurance and the government if necessary, in order that all COVID-19 cases could be hospitalized 19 .

To contain the virus at the epicenter, Wuhan was placed under lockdown with traffic ban for all residents starting on January 23. The lockdown is not expected to be lifted until April 8. Local buses, subways, and ferries ceased operation. Ridehailing services were prohibited, and only a limited number of taxis were allowed on road by January 24. Residents are not permitted to leave the city. Departure flights and trains were canceled at the city airport and train stations. Checkpoints were set up at highway entrances to prevent cars from leaving the city. Since January 22, it became mandatory to wear masks at work or in public places. 19 There was insufficient hospital capacity in Hubei (and Wuhan in particular) in late January. Most patients in Wuhan were hospitalized and isolated around mid February with the completion of new hospitals, makeshift health facilities, and increased testing capacity. See Section 5.1 for details. 20 We should note that the summary of China's policy responses here is not a comprehensive list. Other entities have also made efforts to help curtail the spread of COVID-19. For example, on January 27, the State Grid Corporation of China declared that it would continue supplying electricity to resident users even if payment was not received on time. School and universities were closed already because of Lunar New Year holidays. In addition, all cities in Hubei province implemented the lockdown policy, and most Hubei cities had also adopted measures commensurate with class A infectious diseases by January 28 21 . Residents in those areas were strongly encouraged to stay at home and not to attend any activity involving public gathering.",

People were frequently reminded by official media (via TV news and phone messages) and social media to stay at home and avoid gathering activities. On January 26, China State Council extended this holiday to February 2 to delay people's return travel and curtail the virus spread. Nevertheless, economic activities are still supposed to resume after the spring festival, bringing people back to workplaces, which may increase the risk of virus spread. To help local residents keep social distance and decrease the risk of virus transmissions, many cities started to implement the \"closed management of communities\" and \"family outdoor restrictions\" policies since late January (Table 7) , encouraging residents to restrict nonessential travels. From January 28 to February 20, more than 250 prefecture-level cities in China implemented \"closed management of communities,\" which typically includes (1) keeping only one entrance for each community, (2) allowing only community residents to enter and exit the community, (3) checking body temperature for each entrant, (4) testing and quarantining cases that exhibit fever immediately, and (5) tracing and quarantining close contacts of suspicious cases. Meanwhile, residents who had symptoms of fever or dry cough were required to report to the community and were quarantined and treated in special medical facilities. Furthermore, local governments of 127 cities also imposed more stringent \"family outdoor restrictions\"-residents are confined or strongly encouraged to stay at home with limited exceptions, e.g., only one person in each family may go out for shopping for necessities once every 2 days 24 . Exit permits were usually distributed to each family in advance and recollected when residents reenter the community. Contacts of those patients were also traced and quarantined. Table 7 summarizes the number of cities that had imposed \"closed management of communities\" or \"family outdoor restrictions\" by different dates in February.",

Assuming a fatality rate of 4%, there would be 56,339 more deaths. The magnitude of the effect from Wuhan lockdown and local NPIs is considerably smaller. As a result of Wuhan lockdown, 31,071 (95% CI, 8296 \u223c 53, 845) fewer cases would be reported for cities outside Hubei by February 29 (scenario C). Closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions would reduce the number of cases by 3803 (95% CI, 1142 \u223c 6465; or 15.78 per city with the policy) and 2703 (95% CI, 654 \u223c 4751; or 21.98 per city with the policy), respectively. These estimates, combined with additional assumptions on the value of statistical life, lost time from work, etc., may contribute to cost-benefit analyses of relevant public health measures.",

Our retrospective analysis of the data from China complements the simulation study Fig. 7 Counterfactual policy simulations. This figure displays the daily differences between the total predicted number and the actual number of daily new COVID-19 cases for each of the four counterfactual scenarios for cities outside Hubei province in mainland China. The spike on February 12 in scenario C is due to a sharp increase in daily case counts in Wuhan resulting from changes in case definitions in Hubei province (see Appendix B for details) of Ferguson et al. (2020) . Our estimates indicate that suppressing local transmission rates at low levels might have avoided one million or more infections in China. Chinazzi et al. (2020) also find that reducing local transmission rates is necessary for effective containment of COVID-19. The public health policies announced by the national and provincial authorities in the last 2 weeks in January may have played a determinant role (Tian et al. 2020) in keeping local transmission rates in cities outside Hubei at low levels throughout January and February. Among the measures implemented following provincial level I responses, Shen et al. (2020) highlight the importance of contact tracing and isolation of close contacts before onset of symptoms in preventing a resurgence of infections once the COVID-19 suppression measures are relaxed. We also find that travel restrictions on high-risk areas (the lockdown in Wuhan), and to a lesser extent, closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions, further reduce the number of cases. It should be noted that these factors may overlap in the real world. In the absence of the lockdown in Wuhan, the health care systems in cities outside Hubei could face much more pressure, and local transmissions may have been much higher. In China, the arrival of the COVID-19 epidemic coincided with the Lunar New Year for many cities. Had the outbreak started at a different time, the effects and costs of these policies would likely be different.",

Our sample is from January 19 to February 29 and covers key episodes such as the initial spread of the virus across China, the peak of infections in terms of domestic case counts, and the gradual containment of the virus in China. Changes in weather conditions induce exogenous variations in past infection rates, which allow us to identify the causal impact of past infections on new cases. The estimates suggest that the infectious effect of the existing cases is mostly observed within 1 week and people's responses can break the chain of infections. Comparing estimates in two sub-samples, we observe that the spread of COVID-19 has been effectively contained by mid February, especially for cities outside Hubei province. Data on real-time population flows between cities have become available in recent years. We show that this new source of data is valuable in explaining between-city transmissions of COVID-19, even after controlling for traditional measures of geographic and economic proximity.",

Behind the grim statistics, more and more national and local governments are implementing countermeasures. Cross border travel restrictions are imposed in order to reduce the risk of case importation. In areas with risks of community transmissions, public health measures such as social distancing, mandatory quarantine, and city lockdown are implemented. In a series of counterfactual simulations, we find that based on the experience in China, preventing sustained community transmissions from taking hold in the first place has the largest impact, followed by restricting population flows from areas with high risks of infections. Local public health measures such as closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions can further reduce the number of infections.",

The influence of weather conditions on policy adoption may be complicated, so we use the Cluster-Lasso method of Belloni et al. (2016) to select the weather variables that have good predictive power on the adoption of closed management of communities or family outdoor restrictions. Let d ct be the dummy variable of the adoption of the local public health measure, i.e., d ct = 1 if the policy is in place in city c at day t. q ct is a vector of candidate weather variables, including weekly averages of daily mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, dew point, stationlevel pressure, sea-level pressure, visibility, wind speed, maximum wind speed, snow depth, precipitation, dummy for adverse weather conditions, squared terms of these variables, and interactions among them. First, city and day fixed effects are removed. d ct = d ct \u2212 1 n c d ct \u2212 1 T t d ct + 1 nT ct d ct andq ct is defined similarly. The Cluster-Lasso method solves the following minimization problem: 1 nT ct d ct \u2212q ct b 2 + \u03bb nT k \u03c6 k |b k |.

A larger penalty value forces more coefficients to zero. The penalty parameters are picked using the theoretical result of Belloni et al. (2016) . The estimation uses the Stata package by Ahrens et al. (2019) . Table 10 lists the selected weather variables, which are used as the instruments in Table 8 . The dependent variable is the number of daily new cases. The endogenous explanatory variables include the average numbers of new confirmed cases in the own city and nearby cities in the preceding first and second weeks (model A) and averages in the preceding 14 days (model B). Weekly averages of daily maximum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, the interaction between precipitation and wind speed, and the inverse log distance weighted sum of these variables in other cities, during the preceding third and fourth weeks, are used as instrumental variables in the IV regressions.

            "text": "COVID-19 case definitions were changed in Hubei province on February 12 and February 20. Starting on February 12, COVID-19 cases could also be confirmed based on clinical diagnosis in Hubei province, in addition to molecular diagnostic tests. This resulted in a sharp increase in the number of daily new cases reported in Hubei, and in particular Wuhan (Fig. 2) . The use of clinical diagnosis in confirming cases ended on February 20. The numbers of cases that are confirmed based on clinical diagnosis for February 12, 13, and 14 are reported by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and are displayed in Table 11 . As a robustness check, we re-estimate the model after removing these cases from the daily case counts (Fig. 8 ). Our main findings still hold (Table 12 ). The transmission rates are significantly lower in February compared with January. Population flow from the epidemic source increases the infections in destinations, and this effect is slightly delayed in February. It is convenient to write it in vector form,where Y nt = y 1t \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 y nt and nt are n \u00d7 1 vectors. Assuming that Y ns = 0 if s \u2264 0, because our sample starts on January 19, and no laboratory confirmed case was reported before January 19 in cities outside Wuhan. X nt = x 1t \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 x nt is an n \u00d7 k matrix of the control variables. H nt,s (\u03b1 within ) is an n \u00d7 n Y. Qiu et al.diagonal matrix corresponding to the s-day time lag, with parameters \u03b1 within = {\u03b1 k within,\u03c4 } k=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,K within ,\u03c4 =1,2 . For example, for s = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 7, the ith diagonal element of H nt,s (\u03b1 within ) is 1 7 K within k=1 \u03b1 k within,1h k1 ct,i , and for s = 8, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 14, the ith diagonal element of H nt,s (\u03b1 within ) is 1 7 K within k=1 \u03b1 k within,2h k2 ct,i . M nt,s (\u03b1 between ) is constructed similarly. For example, for s = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 7 and i = j , the ij th element of M nt,s (\u03b1 between ) is 1 7 K between k=1 \u03b1 k between,1m k1 ij t . Z \u03c4 nt is an n \u00d7 K Wuhan matrix corresponding to the transmission from Wuhan. For example, the ikth element of Z 1 nt is m k1 i,Wuhan,tz 1 t . We first estimate the parameters in Eq. 4 by 2SLS and obtain the residual\u015d n1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u02c6 nT . Let\u00b7 denote the estimated value of parameters and\u00b7 denote the counterfactual changes. The counterfactual value of Y nt is computed recursively,The counterfactual change for date t is Y nt =\u1ef8 nt \u2212 Y nt . The standard error of Y nt is obtained from 1000 bootstrap iterations. In each bootstrap iteration, cities are sampled with replacement and the model is estimated to obtain the parameters. The counterfactual predictions are obtained using the above equations with the estimated parameters and the counterfactual scenario (e.g., no cities adopted lockdown).Publisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",
