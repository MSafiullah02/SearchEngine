Despite the 13 containment efforts implemented by the national political 14 and health authorities of each Country, the pandemic has 15 not reached its peak yet. 16 The exponential increase in the number of cases 17 translated into an urgent need to reallocate medical 18 resources to the assistance of COVID-19 patients, with 19 redistribution of medical/surgical activities not primarily 20 involved in the management of COVID-19 patients [3]. In the 21 last month, in many European centers, the urological 22 activity has been limited to urgent procedures and 23 oncological priorities. However, what is to be considered 24 a uro-oncological priority remains debatable, despite some 25 recommendations having recently been published 26",
