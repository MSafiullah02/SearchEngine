The purpose of the alternative method, based on a series of filtration steps, is the production of Colostrinov, a product whose main ingredient is bovine colostrum, to be used for foal nutrition. Since the filtration techniques used are known to eliminate particles of the size of bacteria, fungi and protozoa from liquids, it is reasonable to assume that the microfiltration process reduces these contaminants to a level at least equivalent to the treatment required by the legislation. Owing to their small size, viruses are not retained by the mechanical effect of the filters but they may be retained by physico-chemical interactions with the surface of the filter, depending on the surface properties of the viruses and those of the filter, as well as on the properties of the surrounding liquid.

Therefore, a description of the characteristics of the filters used for the microfiltration process is essential. Data on the effectiveness of HTST treatment on virus reduction in the scientific literature is limited. HTST is not adequate to eliminate foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in milk completely (Cunliffe et al., 1979; Tomasula and Konstance, 2004) as shown in different studies. For example, HTST achieved a 4 log 10 reduction of FMDV in bovine milk, although it did not completely remove infectivity (Aly and Gaber, 2007; Tomasula et al., 2007) . Similar findings were reported by Donaldson (1997) and Ryan et al. (2008) with a 5 log 10 reduction. HTST was also found to only partially inactivate poliovirus type 1 (Strazynski et al., 2002) . In a study in human milk, HTST pasteurisation is highly effective against some lipid enveloped viruses of pathogenic potential in humans, with limited or no inactivation observed for some non-lipid enveloped viruses (Terpstra et al., 2007) . In addition, according to Escudero-Abarca et al. (2014), milk pasteurisation may not be stringent enough to eliminate Snow Mountain virus (SMV), and perhaps other prototype human norovirus (HuNoV).",
