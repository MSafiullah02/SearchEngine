It can infect chickens at all ages and replicates in many tissues, causing respiratory symptoms, diarrhea, decline of egg production and quality, etc. (Cavanagh, 2007a, Cavanagh, 2007b, Abd et al., 2009). Prevention of IB is of economic importance to the poultry industry due to the high morbidity and production losses associated with the disease (Cavanagh, 2005). Although vaccines are now being used widely and extensively, outbreaks of IB still occur frequently due to the epidemic IB virus (IBV) strains (Zou et al., 2010). It is well known that little or no cross-protection occurs between different serotypes of IBV, and new serotypes may appear in the future, complicating the prevention and control of IB.",

The S glycoprotein is posttranslationally cleaved at protease cleavage recognition motifs into the animal-terminal S1 and carboxyl-terminal S2 subunits by cellular protease (Jackwood et al., 2001, Cavanagh et al., 1986). The S1 glycoprotein contains epitopes that induce virus-neutralizing, serotype-specific antibodies, hemagglutination inhibition antibodies, and cross-reactivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibodies (Niesters et al., 1987). It also plays an important role in tissue tropism and the degree of virulence of the virus (Casais et al., 2003). The appearance of these variants hinders the prophylactic strategy carried out by the breeders of the Moroccan poultry farm. In order to solve this problem, we have opted to study the structure of the hypervariable region of the S1 protein of serotype Italy02 and Mass in silico by molecular modeling, where the largest number of epitopes identified by neutralizing antibodies is observed (Koch et al., 1992).",

This homology was evaluated by the I-TASSER server, which allows us to generate 3D models from the protein sequence. These models were then ranked in specific order and defined by the TM-score which measures the deviation distance (Angstrom) between the residual position of the model and the native structure. The score obtained by I-TASSER revealed that the two modeled sequences used in this study have a more significant TM-score that exceeds the value of 0.5 (TM-Score=0.63), confirming that the model is biologically significant and has a correct structural topology (Fig. 4.1\n, Table 4.1\n).",
