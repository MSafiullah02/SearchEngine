The curative treatment, when applicable, is neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with surgical resection and radical lymphadenectomy. Although some benign disorders can result in esophagectomy, esophageal malignancy is the main reason for resection. Despite medical, surgical, nutritional and critical care advances, esophagectomy remains an operative intervention with high morbidity and mortality even when compared to other complex surgical procedures. Mortality rates vary depending on many factors and have been reported as 5\u201310%3\u20135. However, morbidity occurs in over 50% of cases and pulmonary complications, are almost universally seen as the greatest post-operative challenge for healthcare providers6. Moreover, patients who suffer from pneumonia show a seven-fold increase in mortality7. Causative microorganisms for pulmonary infection usually belong to the oropharyngeal flora, as this is likely the result of cervical anastomosis leakage.",

In the former category, immune-compromising conditions, older age, malignancy, corticosteroid or cytotoxic therapy and neutropenia have all shown to increase the risk of invasive Candida infections8. Mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients suffer from colonization with Candida species in 25% of cases, whereas colonization occurs in 50% of the patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia9. Nevertheless, pneumonia caused by Candida is rare10. On the other hand, systemic yeast infections are associated with increased morbidity and mortality9,11. Complex diagnostics and clinical uncertainty in these, often critically ill patients, can lead to at least a challenging management course and at worst futile demise. Therefore, a prophylactic treatment strategy for high-risk patients may be of benefit and result in improved clinical progress and overall patient outcomes11.",

The selective decontamination principle is based on eradication of certain pathogens (i.e. aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and yeast), resulting in fewer ICU-acquired infections. In 2011, a double-blind randomized controlled trial was carried out to evaluate the effect of SDD (a regimen consisting of oral, non-absorbable paste and enteral antibiotics including amphotericin B, tobramycin, colistin and intravenous cefotaxime or other third generation cephalosporins) or placebo in addition to standard antibiotic prophylaxis in patients receiving elective gastrointestinal surgery16. SDD in addition to the standard intravenous antibiotics reduced the incidence of postoperative infections and anastomotic leakage.",

Indeed, a higher one-year mortality for DM patients with a yeast infection compared to patients without yeast infection (p = 0.003) was demonstrated. To analyze whether a positive yeast culture in drain fluid from patients with a suspected cervical anastomosis leakage is reflected in the respective patients\u2019 survival, we compared the outcomes of patients with positive or negative yeast culture from polymicrobial drain fluids. Figure 3C shows a substantial reduction in survival of patients whose drain fluid contained a polymicrobial contamination that tested positive upon yeast culture (p = 0.005). Although not all patients with yeast-positive drain cultures were defined as having a yeast infection, the presence of yeast in drain fluid is indicative for an effect on survival.",

There has long been a multifactorial correlation between DM and both general and surgery-specific infections24,25. DM is also a preoperative predictor of mortality in esophagectomy patients with increased morbidity and mortality5,26. A systematic review by Li and colleagues demonstrated a link between anastomotic leakage and DM in esophagectomy patients following a similar conclusion in general abdominal surgery patients27,28. We identified anastomotic leakage as the most prevalent underlying etiology of complications (Fig. 2), which is consistent with the results of Raymond et al. who illustrated 12.0% anastomotic leakage and 12.2% pneumonia in 4321 esophagectomy patients2. However, the results of our current study provide no evidence for the same incidence of documented pneumonia. Given the link between cervical anastomotic leakage and pulmonary and polymicrobial infections, the relationship between DM and the development of yeast infection is likely based on a multifaceted interaction. Polymicrobial positive culture from pleural effusion can be logically explained, in this patient category, by cervical anastomotic leakage. Accordingly, the presence of gastro-intestinal microbial flora on pleural fluid culture is usually part of the diagnostic tree. Further, it should be noted that diagnosis of anastomotic leakage is often difficult as current radiological investigations are non-specific. It is therefore conceivable that the prevalence of yeast infection can be attributed to an increased incidence of anastomotic leakage in DM patients.",

However, one should bear in mind that yeast is a component of the human mucosal microbiota despite not always being cultured. It is also necessary to mention the sporadic use of SDD in some patients in our study, which involved the administration of an oral, non-absorbable paste with enteral antibiotics including amphotericin B, tobramycin and colistin, as well as intravenous administration of cefotaxime. This was not a global policy adopted by all of the ICUs within the UMCG and, therefore, the numbers are believed to be small. From October 2005 to April 2006 the SDD-regimen was infrequently used as part of a clinical trial12. Additionally, from the summer of 2013, some of this patient cohort may have received SDD. This was introduced as a general infection prevention measure in the ICU following the aforementioned trial, but not used in all esophagectomy patients.

Our clinical opinion is that patients who commenced therapy were more acutely unwell, which complicates interpretation of our retrospective survival analysis.

These patients are not routinely subject to antifungal therapy. Patients with yeast in their pleural drain fluid showed a diminished survival and therefore, it seems that even the presence of yeast is indicative for survival outcome. However, we recognize this could be the result of increased antimicrobial administration in critically ill patients, resulting in yeast overgrowth. Further, yeast colonization was detected by sputum or throat cultures in the pre- or early post-operative period. From the numbers shown in Table 1, no significant effect of colonization on yeast infection can be inferred. However, the diagnostic microbiology laboratory did not consistently report all yeast in sputum cultures during this period and patients were not routinely screened for yeast colonization.
