It is not enough to expect the correct diagnosis to eventually reveal itself if a multitude of laboratory tests and imaging studies are ordered. In the absence of an expert physical examination, a child with ascites of cardiac origin may undergo multiple studies of the liver over many weeks before the correct etiology is recognized.

The fi rst of these is age at presentation, primarily because many diseases have a typical age (range) of onset. This may allow us to eliminate some diseases completely, for example, primary biliary cirrhosis has never been described in a young child, and to relegate the possibility of yet others, for example, hepatomegaly fi rst encountered in an adolescent is unlikely to be due to glycogen storage disease. Evidence of liver disease present at birth may imply an intrauterine process such as defects of embryonic developmental genes, congenital infections, or isoimmune phenomena, whereas early postnatal disease may indicate an inborn error of metabolism or infection acquired perinatally.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Assessment: The Importance of a Careful History and an Expert Physical Examination"}, {"text": "The next general consideration is whether there is a predisposition to developing certain forms of liver disease, i.e., other medical conditions that may predispose to specifi c liver diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with preexisting ulcerative colitis or hepatoblastoma in a child with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Similarly the onset of liver disease during pregnancy such as HELLP (hypertension, elevated liver tests, and low platelets) syndrome or acute fatty liver of pregnancy may indicate metabolic disease in the fetus and usually carrier status in the woman. A detailed family history will help reveal potential familial predisposition such as parental consanguinity or a previous sibling with a single-gene defect. Occasionally there is manifestation of a heterozygous status in relatives such as cholelithiasis in the family of the child with MDR3 defi ciency. In a patient suspected of having autoimmune hepatitis, a history in the extended family of other autoimmune conditions such as lupus or hypothyroidism is likely to be relevant.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Assessment: The Importance of a Careful History and an Expert Physical Examination"}, {"text": "Environmental exposure to infectious or toxic agents is another general consideration that may alter probabilities within a list of differential diagnoses. Infectious etiologies may gain priority due to an endemic risk at place of abode or recent travel to an at-risk area. A history of drinking or bathing in water from a local supply while traveling raises the possibility of a whole range of infectious agents capable of inducing liver injury. International travel is not, however, a prerequisite for unusual infections that may manifest as liver disease; for example, Histoplasma capsulatum, a cause of granulomatous hepatitis especially in the immunocompromised, is endemic in some central and southern US states [ 3 ] , and baylisascariasis, a rare cause of hepatomegaly and meningoencephalitis, has been described in young children who have ingested soil contaminated with raccoon feces [ 4 ] . Knowledge that a mother has a chronic transmissible infection, particularly hepatitis B but also including hepatitis C, HIV, malaria, and Chagas disease [ 5 ] , may simplify the diagnosis of an infant with liver disease. Exposure to industrial toxins, particularly from pollutant spills, is usually reported, but particularly in the developing world, there may not be a full disclosure; therefore, direct questioning is essential. Also all drug exposures should be assessed including herbal and homeopathic remedies and dietary supplements. Ingestion of wild mushrooms is a particular risk. Amanita species are found in many parts of the world, while other foods collected straight from nature may be either directly toxic or chemically contaminated. Not all effects of environmental exposure occur immediately upon exposure; minocyclineinduced autoimmune hepatitis takes a period of 12-20 months from initiation of treatment for teenage acne, for instance, before liver dysfunction appears [ 6 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 718, "end": 723, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 894, "end": 899, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1060, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1898, "text": "[ 6 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Assessment: The Importance of a Careful History and an Expert Physical Examination"}, {"text": "Triggering factors are specifi c environmental exposures that do not cause disease but reveal its presence.

Additionally, although established liver disease is rare, it is not uncommon to see mild abnormalities of liver function tests. In infants jaundice is frequently seen in the form of physiologic neonatal jaundice and breast milk jaundice. Although these causes manifest as unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, it does mean that the mere presence of jaundice in a newborn infant does not necessarily raise the suspicion of liver disease. The diffi culties of diagnosis are doubly increased when dealing with acute liver failure; not only are there severe constraints on the time available for a full diagnostic work-up but hepatic metabolic function is severely deranged, sometimes making the differentiation between primary and secondary metabolic abnormalities virtually impossible by biochemical means. Fortunately there are now much greater nucleic acid-based options for primary diagnosis of specifi c inborn errors of metabolism, but results can take time to become available. Another concern in the early detection of pediatric liver disease relates to the diffi culty of maintaining basic clinical examination skills in an age of advanced imaging techniques. The ability of the physician to use hands and eyes to detect clinical signs such as hepatomegaly, ascites, and cutaneous features of liver disease needs to be carefully nurtured among medical students and junior medical staff. Finally, there are a number of terms that are commonly used in regard to liver disease that mean the diagnosis has not been identifi ed such as \"idiopathic\" fulminant hepatic failure, \"cryptogenic\" cirrhosis, and \"neonatal hepatitis.\" It is important to remember that these are not diagnoses but an admission that the diagnostic work-up has failed to identify the primary cause of liver disease. The acceptance of these terms as seemingly discreet diseases may be in some way responsible for incomplete diagnostic work-up. Narkewicz et al. describe how frequently a suboptimal diagnostic work-up is seen in children presenting with acute liver failure when given a diagnosis of idiopathic liver failure even in the context of a multicenter study [ 9 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2300, "end": 2305, "text": "[ 9 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Why Diagnosing Liver Disease May Be Diffi cult"}, {"text": "Most consultations done for suspected liver disease in the newborn nursery or neonatal intensive care are on infants with other reasons to be there and have not yet been home. Less frequently their primary reason is because of liver dysfunction at or within days of birth. Liver dysfunction may be inherent from congenital infection or inborn error of metabolism or secondary to other peri-or postnatal events such as isch-emia, necrotizing enterocolitis, congenital heart disease, abdominal surgery, or the need for parenteral feeding.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phenotypes The Sick Newborn"}, {"text": "Clinical features which may indicate liver disease include ascites, hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia and coagulopathy, hepatomegaly with or without splenomegaly, cholestasis, and abnormal liver function tests. Congenital liver disease may result in early fetal loss, but the classical presentation is the hydropic infant with hepatomegaly, congenital ascites, hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy, and very-early-onset cholestasis. These fi ndings are not specifi c for primary congenital liver disease as congenital ascites is commonly due to severe fetal anemia, both isoimmune and nonimmune causes such as alpha thalassemia, or fetal heart failure, and is mostly seen in the setting of generalized hydrops fetalis (see Table 6 .2 for a more complete list of causes). When primary liver disease is suspected, an important diagnosis to consider is \"neonatal hemochromatosis.\" Studies by Whitington and colleagues have demonstrated that the majority of these cases are due to a maternal factor (presumably an IgG alloantibody) crossing the placenta and inducing complement-mediated hepatocellular injury, one result of which is excessive iron deposition [ 10 ] . This immune-mediated \"neonatal hemochromatosis\" condition has been renamed gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) (see chapter 10 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1143, "end": 1149, "text": "[ 10 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 711, "end": 718, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Phenotypes The Sick Newborn"}, {"text": "There are also infants who were seemingly healthy at birth but within a few hours to a few days develop features of acute liver failure (see Table 6 .3 ) with coagulopathy and hyperammonemia. There is considerable overlap with the causes of congenital ascites although viral infection acquired at or around the time of birth is more likely, disseminated neonatal herpes simplex being a frequently encountered cause. Generalize septicemia and, in at-risk populations, congenital malaria may also present in this manner. Inborn errors of metabolism with infantile acute presentation may include lysosomal storage defects but are more likely to be defects of intermediate metabolism such as galactosemia, organic acidemias, and glycogen storage disease type I (see chapter 8 ) . GALD may also present similarly although there is usually evidence of chronic liver disease. An important diagnosis to exclude, because liver transplantation is contraindicated, is hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), but HLH characteristically has a more delayed onset with patients tending to present later in infancy (see chapters 12 and 29 ). Severe liver dysfunction may be seen with vascular compromise as well, such as thrombosis of the inferior vena cava or hepatic veins, and with congenital portal vein anomalies. Heart failure secondary to congenital heart disease may result in an ischemic hepatitis, and rarely congenital leukemia or myelodysplasia can present with acute liver failure. Commonly, despite intensive work-up, no specifi c cause is found; however, as has been cautioned in the introduction, the diagnosis of \"idiopathic\" neonatal hepatitis should not be assumed until all recognized causes have been excluded (see chapter 12 ). Certainly the proportion of patients with this label of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis has fallen over the years with the discovery of novel conditions and disease mechanisms, and it is to be hoped that eventually the term will become unnecessary. Until then idiopathic neonatal hepatitis should be seen as a challenge to further diagnostic adventure rather than an end in itself.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 770, "end": 773, "text": "8 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 141, "end": 148, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Phenotypes The Sick Newborn"}, {"text": "Although not all infants in the neonatal unit with evidence of liver disease are as sick as patients with hydrops or acute liver failure, the differential diagnosis for hepatitis with or without cholestasis remains large (see Table 6 .4 ). Certainly the diagnoses that were entertained for the sicker group of infants may be found manifest with less severe disease; thus, congenital infection, storage disorders, and GALD still appear in the differential diagnosis for infants with simple cholestasis and elevated transaminases, but a larger spectrum of etiologies also needs to be considered including genetic and chromosomal syndromes that may be apparent from abnormal physical features, as well as vascular, endocrine, and neoplastic causes. Additionally, in those infants who have intestinal failure (usually related to surgical resection for necrotizing enterocolitis or congenital intestinal anomalies), cholestasis is related to enteral starvation and the need for intravenous feeding (see chapter 17 ). Less commonly iatrogenic causes of neonatal liver disease may be seen, such as portal vein thrombosis or extravasation of parenteral fl uids into the liver substance (see Fig. 6 .1 ) complicating umbilical venous catheterization [ 11 ] . Although hepatomegaly, abnormal transaminase, and even cholestasis may be present in multisystem diseases, these may not be the key features on which the diagnosis is based. For example, in many lysosomal storage conditions, abnormal facies, neurological fi ndings, skeletal malformations, or other tissue involvement may point to the diagnosis (a list of metabolic defects that have been associated with liver disease is shown in Table 6 .5 ). Certain syndromes such as ARC (arthrogryposis, renal anomalies, and cholestasis), Aagenaes, Donahue, or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome also have characteristic physical manifestations, and the presence of hepatomegaly or liver function abnormalities simply supports the diagnosis. Liver involvement in multisystem diseases may manifest in some infants with hepatomegaly alone and will be reliant upon a careful physical examination to identify the relevant fi nding. The request for a hepatological opinion in such circumstances is to determine if the fi ndings are consistent with the primary diagnosis, if there is a second diagnosis responsible for the liver abnormalities observed, to estimate prognosis, and to advise on appropriate management of the liver dysfunction.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1241, "end": 1247, "text": "[ 11 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 226, "end": 233, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1189, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1688, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Phenotypes The Sick Newborn"}, {"text": "Infants discharged from the nursery presenting within days of birth with acute liver failure (see Table 6 .3 ) (see chapter 23 ) have a large diagnostic overlap with those who have been seen as a consultation presenting in the newborn period.

The general pediatrician sees more children with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia secondary to prolonged physiologic jaundice or breast milk jaundice than they do children with cholestatic jaundice. Infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia have colorless urine and pigmented stools (yellow-green or brown) [ 12 ] . It is important to recognize that infants without conjugated hyperbilirubinemia do not pass yellow or amber urine because they drink at least 100 mL/kg/day and therefore pass dilute urine, unlike adults who frequently pass more concentrated yellow urine. Unconjugated jaundice still needs to be investigated if it is either very early in onset, prolonged beyond 10-14 days, very high levels, or of late onset. If breast milk jaundice is suspected and there is no evidence of hemolysis or infection, thyroid function is normal, and bilirubin levels are not progressively increasing, breast-feeding does not need to be discontinued. However, if the bilirubin level continues to rise, defects of bilirubin conjugation (Crigler-Najjar syndrome) should be considered. The high frequency of unconjugated jaundice in the infant population is one factor that has been suggested for late referrals of infants with biliary atresia; the rare case of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is like a proverbial needle in the haystack of infants with unconjugated jaundice! It is important for the general pediatrician to remain alert to the possibility that an infant's jaundice is cholestatic and request split bilirubin levels -total and direct or better still conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin levels (see chapter 3 ). Referrals to the pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist are most commonly for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, although the type of jaundice is not always characterized before referral. Due to the importance of a timely hepatoportoenterostomy to the prognosis of the affected infant, the diagnosis of biliary atresia needs to be ruled out promptly. There has been much discussion on the best combination of sonography, scintigraphy, liver biopsy, and cholangiography (see chapter 13 ), but effi ciency of work-up demands a certain degree of experience in the team and institution caring for the infant.

The inclusion of \u03b3-glutamyl transferase and creatine kinase (or other muscle-derived enzyme such as aldolase) can help differentiate the tissue source of elevated levels of AST and ALT. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a particularly important diagnosis to consider. Another cause of elevated transaminase levels in the absence of liver disease is due to macroenzymes (especially macro-AST) [ 13 ] . Serum enzymes may complex with immunoglobulins resulting in a high molecular weight complex that has a prolonged half-life because of reduced plasma clearance. Although macroenzymes have been associated with acute, chronic, and malignant liver disease, most cases appear benign and self-limiting although the triggers for formation are not fully understood. Benign (or transient) hyperphosphatasia is frequently seen in young children possibly provoked by a mild intercurrent illness [ 14 ] .

Hepatitis E in endemic areas rarely causes signifi cant clinical disease in young children but is more likely to cause acute hepatitis as subjects' age and is particularly dangerous for the pregnant teenage girl (see chapter 15 ). Autoimmune hepatitis often presents with acute hepatitis and although more frequent in adolescent girls can occur in both sexes and at any age (see chapter 16 ). Most cases of Wilson disease diagnosed in childhood and adolescence manifest as acute, often fulminant, hepatitis, and although rare, an expedient diagnosis may prevent death or liver transplantation (see chapter 9 ). Everyone involved in the care of children recognizes the obesity crisis that is so highly prevalent in the USA and is also sweeping the rest of the developed world. This single factor accounts for the majority of new referrals of children with elevated transaminases in the USA as a result of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (see chapter 18 ). This was an uncommon diagnosis 25 years ago, and despite multicenter collaborative efforts to design treatments for this condition, it is likely that the solution, if one is to be forthcoming, will be in the realm of public policy development to curtail obesity rather than singlepatient medical management.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 262, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Older Child/Adolescent with Liver Disease (>5 Years)"}, {"text": "Gall stones and gall bladder disease can cause jaundice and elevated transaminases and increase as adulthood approaches (see chapter 20 ).

More commonly isolated splenomegaly is identifi ed, and if portal hypertension is not considered, the child or teenager may go through detailed hematological investigations unnecessarily. Extrahepatic portal hypertension, due to portal vein thrombosis having occurred usually years before frequently in infancy related to umbilical sepsis or catheterization, can present with splenomegaly. Alternatively, the detection of portal hypertension may be the fi rst sign of chronic liver injury, for example, in autoimmune hepatitis or chronic viral hepatitis, resulting in cirrhosis, but with no history of previous ill health in the child (see Table 6 .11 ). In these circumstances the liver is usually shrunken, and therefore not palpable, but on imaging is heterogenous and nodular and the biopsy specimen severely fi brotic. With increasing age the incidence of embryonal tumors diminishes and the risk of HCC and metastatic liver tumors increases (see Table 6 .12 ). Greatest risk for HCC is in association with chronic fi brotic liver disease, but the fi brolamellar variant can be encountered in the adolescent without preexisting liver disease. Benign lesions can get big enough to present as a mass or with abdominal discomfort and include nodular regenerative hyperplasia, focal nodular hyperplasia, and adenoma.

Similar challenges to acute diagnosis exist with many other causes, and great care is required to not miss a potentially treatable cause of liver disease such as autoimmune hepatitis or Wilson disease. Although the single largest group of acute liver failure patients in childhood is those in whom a specifi c etiology is not identifi ed, it does not negate the need for a full and detailed workup. Sadly, even in the context of a multicenter study with recommendations made for appropriate investigation, inadequate investigation of cause is frequently encountered [ 9 ] . There may be clues such as a history of medication or herbal ingestion (see chapter 19 ), encephalopathy that is fl uctuating or out of proportion to the liver dysfunction may point towards a mitochondrial or other metabolic disease, hemolysis can suggest Wilson disease, or foreign travel increasing the likelihood of an infectious cause. Unfortunately these features are neither specifi c nor sensitive, and as much as we may like to narrow our differential diagnosis to address the most likely or most serious diagnoses fi rst, in the situation of acute hepatic failure, all causes are life-threateningly serious, and therefore, an inclusive panel of investigation is the safest and most effi cient approach.

This gets a little convoluted when one considers the acute onset of, say, Wilson disease, acute decompensation of chronic hepatitis B, or autoimmune liver disease, where the clinical picture is of a disease of no longer than a few weeks duration but in whom the liver biopsy shows established fi brosis. As is the convention for this chapter in general, we will limit the discussion to the clinical phenotype, i.e., those who have an apparent acute onset of disease with no history of preexisting liver disease.Acute liver failure results from massive or submassive hepatocellular necrosis, but the syndrome is defi ned in terms of the duration of the illness (less than 8 weeks) and the presence of coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy (see chapter 23 for more details). One important consideration is to differentiate between the acute failure of liver functions manifest by coagulopathy, cholestasis, hyperammonemia, loss of glycemic control, encephalopathy, etc., and the criteria for entry into the PALF (Pediatric Acute Liver Failure) study. In an attempt to be inclusive and to observe the progression from early disease to liver failure, the criteria for entry into PALF were set relatively low, namely, coagulopathy secondary to acute liver disease with an INR of \u22651.5 with hepatic encephalopathy or \u22652.0 in the absence of encephalopathy. There was never an intention to liberalize the definition of acute liver failure, and yet more and more frequently, these study entry criteria are being quoted as the \"defi nition\" of acute liver failure which they patently are not.Differentiating between the causes of acute liver failure can be challenging.
