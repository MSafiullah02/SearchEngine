SARS-CoV, strain Urbani (200300592), was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, Atlanta, GA). The strain was propagated and titrated in Vero 76 cells. For antiviral assays, the serum was reduced to 2% and gentamicin added to the medium at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml.

The 50% cell cytotoxic doses (CC50) and 50% virus inhibitory doses (IC50), representing the putative concentration at which 50% of the monolayers would show compound cytotoxicity or virus cytopathic effect, respectively, were estimated by regression analysis. A selectivity index (SI) was calculated using the formula: SI = CC50/IC50. The activity in the CPE assay was then verified spectrophotometrically by NR uptake assay on the same plate. The NR assay was performed using a modified method of Cavanaugh et al. [25] as described by Barnard et al. [13]. Briefly, NR dye was added to each well of the plate, and the plate incubated for approximately 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in the dark. The NR solution was removed from the wells, rinsed and any remaining dye extracted using ethanol buffered with S\u00f6renson\u2019s citrate buffer. The plates were read at 405/540 nanometers (nm) wavelength with a microplate reader (Opsys MR\u2122, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Absorbance values were expressed as percents of untreated controls and IC50, CC50, and SI values were calculated as described above.",

However, IFN-alfacon 1 did not always work in the Vero 76 cells. The activity against SARS-CoV in Vero 76 cells was sporadic and appeared to be highly variable depending upon the age and condition of the host cells. The monolayers of Vero 76 cells had to be rinsed gently to achieve valid NR assays. Then, IFN-alfacon 1 inhibition of virus replication was further tested in Vero E6 cells and MA104 cells. IFN-alfacon 1 provided a complete protection at the higher doses and a linear dose response at the lower part of the concentration curve. IC50 was 4.6 ng/ml in Vero E6 cells and, 0.29 ng/ml in MA104 cells, respectively (Table 1). IFN-alfacon 1 also inhibited SARS-CoV isolate with SI values ranging from >22 to >625 (Table 1).

SARS-CoV was found to productively infect human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells; SARS-CoV-induced CPE was initially observed in medium containing 20% FCS at day 8 and 2% FCS at day 4 [24]. Based on these observations, IFN-alfacon 1 was evaluated to test the inhibitory effect on plating of SARS-CoV infection from the culture fluids of the infected Calu-3 cells. The supernatants were kept frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until they were needed for assessing infectious viral titers by a standard TCID50 assay with permissive Vero 76 cells, as described above. The activity of IFN-alfacon 1 was confirmed by the virus yield reduction assay. IFN-alfacon 1 blocked viral production after incubation for 3 days in comparison to mock-treated cells and reduced virus yields by 90% at 0.046 ng/ml (Table 2). IFN-alfacon 1 inhibited SARS-CoV infection in Calu-3 with SI value of 2173 (Table 2). We also verified that SARS-CoV can infect human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells without causing significant cytopathic effects within 3 days of infection (Table 3\n).",

            "text": "Interferons have been considered as the first line of defense against viral infections. Interferon type I is divided into interferon-alpha (leukocyte interferon) produced by virus-infected leukocytes and interferon-beta (fibroblast interferon) produced by virus-infected fibroblasts, or virus-infected epithelial cells. Type 1 interferons (alpha/beta) have been shown to be effective for treating patients with hepatitis type C (HCV) [27]. Alpha interferons, which not only block the replication of several viruses but also activate the immune system, have also been shown to be efficacious in treating hairy cell leukemia, malignant melanoma, and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (an AIDS-related cancer) and interferon-alpha was shown to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication [28]. IFN-alfacon 1 is a non-naturally occurring, novel synthetic recombinant type 1 interferon-alpha developed by comparing the amino acid sequences of several natural interferon-alpha subtypes and assigning the most frequently observed amino acid in each corresponding position to generate a consensus molecule. IFN-alfacon 1 was also approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as the new class of anti-HCV inhibitors. IFN-alfacon 1 is the only IFN tested in human trials. The re-treatment with IFN-alfacon 1 is effective therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C who have either not responded to previous interferon therapy or relapsed after discontinuation of interferon therapy [29]. Paragas et al. reported that the IFN-alfacon 1 had the anti-SARS-CoV activity only before infection in cell-based model in vitro\n[30]. In this case, IFN-alfacon 1 most likely induces an antiviral state in the target cells, which produce a cellular environment that is not suitable for viral replication. However, IFN-alfacon 1 did not show activity when the cells were treated with IFN-alfacon 1 after infection with SARS-CoV, suggesting that IFN-alfacon 1 might not directly block viral replication in cells that are already infected [30]. Loutfy et al. demonstrated that IFN-alfacon 1 was combined with corticosteroids, in a preliminary pilot study, to assess potential clinical benefit and safety for SARS patients. This data suggested that IFN-alfacon 1 might function as an antiviral therapeutic for the treatment of SARS patients [31].",

Epithelial cells are organized in a polarized fashion with two distinct membrane domains, the apical and basolateral domains [32]. The primary targets for SARS-CoV infection are the epithelial cells in the respiratory and intestinal tract. It has been reported that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV [33]. Mossel et al. demonstrated that Vero E6, MA104 and Calu-3 cells expressed human ACE-2 on the apical membrane domain. The infection was initiated successfully from the apical, but not from the basolateral side [23]. Tseng et al. published the first SARS-CoV in vitro replication model using monolayers and polarized Calu-3 cells. The receptor for SARS-CoV is localized on and mediates infection through the apical plasma membrane of respiratory epithelial cells and SARS-CoV entry and release may be focused on the apical surface of these cells [24]. Except Calu-3 cells, no human respiratory epithelial cell lines have been shown as yet to support SARS-CoV infection. In addition to searching for vaccines against SARS-CoV, it is important for advancing our knowledge to understand how SARS-CoV interact with the polarized lung epithelial cells and, to look for other approaches to block viral replication as a means of chemotherapeutic control.",

Calu-3 cells were treated with IFN-alfacon 1 and, inoculated with SARS-CoV isolate, the titers of infectious viral particles in the supernatants harvested after infection for 3 days. We verified that SARS-CoV can be propagated in Calu-3 cells in 3 days (Table 3). The human lung Calu-3 cell line provides a useful model for evaluating efficacy and mechanisms of anti-SARS compounds such as interferon. IFN-alfacon 1 was shown to be more active against SARS-CoV when tested in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells than in African green monkey epithelial cells (Table 2). In our two assay systems, IFN-alfacon 1 demonstrated significant antiviral activity in neutral red uptake assay and virus yield reduction assay. Our data might provide us an important insight into the mechanism of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and these properties might be therapeutically advantageous.",
