ARDS is a frequent and important cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients [4, 6] . Some 74,500 persons die of acute lung injury (ALI) in the United States each year, a figure that is comparable to the number of adult deaths attributed to breast cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in 1999 [6] . More importantly, ARDS occurs with a higher incidence than previously reported, currently estimated to be about 190,600 cases per year in the United States with a mortality rate of 38.5 %, and therefore has a substantial impact on public health [6] .",

Activation of the innate immune response by binding of microbial products or cell injury-associated endogenous molecules (dangerassociated molecular patterns [DAMPs] ) to pattern recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the lung epithelium and alveolar macrophages, is now recognized as a potent driving force for acute lung inflammation. Newly reported innate immune effector mechanisms, such as formation of neutrophil extracellular traps -lattices of chromatin and antimicrobial factors that capture pathogens but can also cause endothelial injury -and histone release by neutrophils may contribute to alveolar injury. Signaling between inflammatory and hemostatic effector cells, such as platelet-neutrophil interaction, is also important.

            "text": "Much controversy remains about the precise contribution, kinetics, and primary role of each one of the putative VILI mechanisms and how best to design a full-bodied mechanical ventilation strategy capable of minimizing the majority of them [12] . A pressing unanswered question remains over the relative role of lung cyclic stretch, in even moderate degrees, vs. low-volume injury. Low-volume injury promotes local concentration of stresses in the vicinity of collapsed regions in heterogeneously aerated lungs together with cyclical recruitment of airways and alveoli. This mechanism tends to predominate in more dependent regions of the lungs and to occur in previously damaged lungs prone to collapse [13, 14] . Tremblay et al. showed increased production of inflammatory cytokines in lungs ventilated without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [15] . Conversely, stretch tends to occur in non-dependent regions and results from increased regional lung volume. Overstretching of alveolar walls causes endothelial and epithelial breaks and interstitial edema. Detachment of endothelial cells from the basement membrane and death of epithelial cells with denuding of the epithelial basement membrane become obvious after 20 min of mechanical ventilation with very high tidal volumes (V T ) [16] . The excessive deformation of epithelial and endothelial cells, as well as of the extracellular matrix, leads to an increased pro-inflammatory response. In some studies, low-volume injury was shown to predominate [13, 14, 17] , whereas in others, including laboratory [18] and clinical studies [19] , overdistension was the prevailing VILI mechanism.",

            "text": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is an advanced nuclear medicine technique used for non-invasive and quantitative measurements of radioactivity concentration within living tissues. It is based on the physical properties of certain isotopes that, when decaying, emit a positron, a particle with a mass equal to an electron but with a positive charge. The positron almost immediately collides with an electron and both are annihilated. In this process, two high-energy photons are created and leave the site of annihilation in opposite directions. The PET scanner is equipped with a large number of scintillation detectors arranged in a ring surrounding the object of interest. When two photons with equal energies are detected in coincidence, the event is stored in a dedicated data array called a sinogram. Typically, many millions of coincidences are stored during a PET scan. Coincidences are collected for a finite amount of time, called a time-frame. With modern PET scanners, a time-frame can range from a few seconds up to several minutes. Dynamic PET is a term used when several time-frames are collected from the same area of the body to track the changes in radioactivity concentration over time. The complete sinogram is then converted into a three-dimensional data array in a process called image reconstruction. Each data entry in this new data array contains the actual radioactivity concentration of a certain portion of the body within the specified time-frame. The three-dimensional image array can be viewed as a stack of tomographic slices on a computer display with color codes for the actual radioactivity concentration. When kinetic information is wanted, the dynamic PET data are processed further with dedicated computer software. Regions of interest are placed at will within the tissue and data resembling the changes in concentration over time are extracted. In advanced kinetic analysis, the time-activity curves of both the blood and the tissue of interest are needed. Advanced kinetic analysis typically involves the use of computer-aided mathematical modeling.",

            "text": "In ALI, the non-barrier functions of the pulmonary endothelium have been emphasized. But the barrier function per se is essential in preserving the most important purpose of the lungs: the adequate exchange of respiratory gases. PET studies have shown that measures of barrier function are a non-specific index of lung injury, indicating functional not structural lung injury [22, 23] . For example, PET imaging methods allow the rate at which proteins move across the endothelial barrier from vascular to extravascular compartments to be measured, the so called pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (PTCER). Palazzo et al. [24] used PET imaging to measure PTCER in an in vivo canine model of unilateral pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury and found that it was increased in the ischemic lung. Interestingly, both lungs had an increased PTCER compared with control nonischemic lungs, suggesting that injury in one lung can lead to similar injury in the contralateral lung, a finding that has been observed in an analogous clinical setting, such as acute unilateral pneumonia. Calandrino et al. [22] described that, while PTCER and extravascular density, a close correlate to extravascular lung water (EVLW), were both elevated in ARDS patients they correlated poorly with one another on a regional basis. Moreover, as extravascular density returned to normal, PTCER remained elevated suggesting that lung tissue injury might be 'subclinical' but still present, even after pulmonary edema has actually resolved. This observation was further confirmed by Sandiford et al. [25] who examined the regional distribution of PTCER and extravascular density more closely in ARDS patients and found ventral-dorsal gradients only for extravascular density but not for PTCER. Once more, functional injury was detected even in lung regions that appeared to be free of structural injury. The finding that the lungs of ARDS patients are more diffusely involved than what might otherwise be assumed from just structural radiological imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), helps explain why ARDS lungs are so vulnerable to VILI: radiographically 'normal' lung, i. e., lung with a normal EVLW content in non-dependent lung regions may still be abnormal and vulnerable to mechanical stresses caused by mechanical venti-lation. These data tell us that non-dependent regions of ARDS lung are 'at risk' because they demonstrate subclinical evidence of injury, which can be made manifest by inappropriate ventilator use. Jones et al. [26] showed a surprisingly high pulmonary uptake of [ 18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG) in patients with head injury at risk of developing ARDS but without lung symptoms at the time of the scan. This signal may reflect sequestration of primed neutrophils in lung capillaries. In vitro studies in isolated human neutrophils have demonstrated that the uptake of deoxyglucose is increased to the same extent in cells that are only primed or primed and stimulated [27] . This finding indicates the vulnerability of these patients while on ventilatory support, because, even though neutrophils remain in a primed state, any additional stimulus precipitates actual tissue damage.",

However, several studies performed in humans [34] and animal models [29] have shown that, during pulmonary inflammation, most of the 18 F-FDG uptake as measured by K i can be attributed to activated neutrophils [35] , even when macrophages are more abundant [30] . Although not usually characterized by an intense 18 F-FDG uptake [36] , macrophages may play a role in the generation of VILI [37] . The latest evidence [38] suggests that macrophages, as well as type 2 epithelial cells, might contribute to the 18 F-FDG uptake signal during VILI. Therefore, although the overall 18 F-FDG uptake signal is a complex mixture of the metabolic activity of many cell types, prior [29, [34] [35] [36] and very recent studies [17] have established that the major influence on the regional signal is the high metabolic activity of recruited neutrophils. In the acutely injured lung, images can therefore be interpreted, with a good approximation, as the regional distribution of neutrophilic inflammation.",

The rate of 18 F-FDG uptake was significantly elevated in both endotoxin-treated groups, but not in the group treated only with oleic acid, leading the authors to conclude that pulmonary vascular leak, and consequently edema, does not significantly contribute to the K i in ARDS lungs.",

We evaluated the individual contributions of regional injurious mechanisms during early stages of VILI. To accomplish this aim, we created an experimental VILI model and designed a study that produced lungs heterogeneously aerated with significant amounts of non-aerated, poorly and normally aerated, and hyperinflated lung tissue (shown by CT). Within the same lung, we simultaneously found tidal hyperinflation, predominantly located in the non-dependent lung region, and collapse with tidal recruitment, mostly located in the dependent region. Remarkably, these two regions, classically comprising the major mechanisms of VILI, had 18 F-FDG uptakes similar to the healthy control group. On the other hand, the remaining regions situated in the intermediate portions of the lung presented a significantly higher uptake. Similarly, in the normal and poorly aerated regions we found the highest differences in 18 F-FDG uptake as compared to healthy controls, whereas the hyperinflated and non-aerated regions were similar to the control group (Fig. 1) . We believe these findings challenge the current notion that hyperinflation and/or repeated collapse and re-expansion of alveolar units play the major role in early VILI. Instead, our data suggest that tidal stretch was highest in the poorly and normally aerated regions and this mechanism is the most important trigger of inflammation in these conditions. They also support the concept that the smaller the ventilated lung, the higher the VILI-triggering forces will be, as a larger fraction of V T is delivered to a smaller lung volume.",

These heterogeneities would tend to produce an uneven distribution of V T within lung regions and might have contributed to VILI. Perlman and Bhattacharya used real-time confocal microscopy to determine the micromechanics of alveolar perimeter distension in perfused rat lungs [41] . These investigators were able to image a 2-\u00b5m thick optical section under the pleura. Five to eight segments were identified within each alveolus. The average length of these segments was compared during normal inflation and hyperinflation. They found segmental distension to be heterogeneous within a single alveolus. Similarly, by using synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic [42] estimated that local strains developing in alveolar walls were as much as four times higher than the global, with 'strain hotspots' occurring within the thinnest parts of the alveolar walls. When studying 3D microscopic distribution of lung parenchyma, using it as an input to their finite element modeling of alveolar expansion, they observed that thin regions may become overstretched, whereas regions with tissue accumulation remain unchallenged. These data fit with our own results and strongly suggest that a tidal stretch of the 'healthy' aerated parts of the heterogeneous aerated ARDS lungs can play a primary role in the activation of the inflammatory signaling cascade. Furthermore, our finding of increased inflammation in normally aerated regions is in agreement with those of Bellani and colleagues [39] who, in their study of ARDS patients, determined that the metabolic activity of aerated regions was associated with both plateau pressure and regional V T normalized by end-expiratory lung gas. Interestingly, neither they nor we found an association between cyclic alveolar recruitment-derecruitment and increased metabolic activity. Some key differences between this clinical study and our experimental observations highlight their complementary nature in terms of understanding VILI: 1) the time on mechanical ventilation before the clinical PET study averaged nine days and ranged from two to sixteen days, likely mixing distinct phases of ARDS and VILI pathophysiology, whereas our experimental study focused on early (hours) ARDS; 2) patients had limited tidal recruitment (2.9 % of the total lung weight) due to the lungprotective mechanical ventilation strategy applied, raising the question whether conditions with higher tidal recruitment would have produced more inflammation in those or in other regions, which our experimental data ruled out; 3) likewise, the amount of tissue undergoing hyperinflation was much smaller in the clinical study compared to our experimental study, because of the relatively low plateau pressures and V T used in the patients. We observed that, even in more extreme ventilatory conditions with significant amounts of collapse, tidal recruitment, and hyperinflation, lung inflammation still predominates in the poorly and normally aerated regions.",

Measurements based on fluorescent microspheres confirmed the existence of ventilation heterogeneity down to length scales of 2 cm 3 [43] , and findings from synchrotron CT suggested that heterogeneity of specific ventilation (defined as ventilation per unit gas volume) can occur at lung volumes as low as 1 mm 3 [44] . Recently, Wellman et al. have elegantly developed methods using PET to assess heterogeneity of specific ventilation at length scales below and above the effective image resolution of 12 mm [40] . Subresolution specific ventilation heterogeneity was reflected by multi-compartment voxel-level tracer kinetics during washout of [ 13 N]nitrogen ( 13 NN) from alveolar air space. These authors modeled the washout kinetics of 13 NN with PET to examine how specific ventilation heterogeneity at different length scales was influenced by lung aeration. They showed that airway narrowing or alveolar derecruitment can occur in poorly aerated lung regions especially at low length scales with a significant component derived from sub-resolution (< 12 mm) length scales. Components of specific ventilation heterogeneity at all studied length scales (< 12 to 60 mm) were highest in poorly aerated regions. Rylander et al., when studying the size and distribution of a \"poorly aerated\" compartment in ARDS patients, observed an uneven distribution of ventilation due to the presence of small-airway closure and/or obstruction [45] . Of note, airway dysfunction has been increasingly recognized as an important contributor to pulmonary impairment in patients with ARDS [46] . Animal models of ARDS have shown that, in addition to damage to the parenchyma, small airway injuries are characterized by bronchiolar epithelial necrosis and sloughing and by rupture of alveolar-bronchiolar attachments [47] . In humans who died with ARDS, small airway changes were characterized by wall thickening with inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and epithelial denudation [46, 48] .",

We believe that the local consequences of the stretch in non-dependent regions and the local consequences of the mechanisms related to collapse in dependent regions are less important than the remote consequent stretches inflicted to the remainder intermediately located \"baby lung\" in terms of regional inflammation. Our findings highlight that we cannot determine which mechanism of VILI is more critical to oppose, but rather they emphasize the importance of strategies capable of minimizing both, collapse and hyperinflation, thereby unloading the small-aerated lung.",

When comparing protective ventilation (V T 8 mL/kg and PEEP titrated to obtain a plateau pressure (Pplat) of 30 cmH 2 O) with injurious ventilation (zero PEEP and V T titrated to obtain a Pplat of 30 cmH 2 O), the former resulted in a more homogeneously distributed uptake. Their findings are compatible with the concept that ventilation strategy plays an early pathogenic role in determining the profile of inflammatory cell distribution before lung injury is established and emphasize that the prevention of VILI should be a key aspect of patient management, even when mechanical ventilation periods and the underlying level of injury are limited [49] . Such results support former suggestion that heterogeneous inflammation may be an important element in the pathogenesis of ARDS [13] . Of note, these results indicate that in early endotoxemia during mechanical ventilation with no PEEP, inflammation predominates in the dependent regions.",

The development of new and more selective/specific tracers to detect early inflammation has the potential to further enhance PET's capabilities and contributions. TNF-\u02dbis a well-known pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by monocytes and macrophages. It mediates the immune response by recruiting white blood cells to sites of inflammation and is involved in acute responses to injury. TNF-\u02dbappears in the circulation during the onset of sepsis-induced lung injury and is suggested to be an important early mediator of ALI. Interestingly, neutrophil recruitment induced by pure mechanical lung stretch has a significant TNF-\u02dbcomponent [50] . PET images of the lung were obtained dynamically after injection of a tracer based on TNF-\u02db. The images were generated with a novel approach with the pre-normalization of data before application of principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a multivariate technique that has become an attractive tool in analyzing dynamic PET images because is a data-driven technique that emphasizes the regions with different kinetics without modeling assumptions. Three different slices at three different levels from the same animal are shown. Coloring is according to a relative scale for each image with black representing minimal and red maximal activity. Note the predominance of the activity in the poorly aerated regions",

In preliminary tests in vivo, using an experimental model of ARDS, we tested a novel positron-emitting ligand of gallium, 68 Ga-TNF\u02db. In the same way as with 18 F-FDG, PET images were obtained dynamically and at the end of the experiment tissue samples were taken from the lung and the abdomen. Significant activity inside the lung tissue was evidenced on the PET/CT images (Fig. 2) . Tissue samples showed TNF-\u02db(as analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) in the lung parenchyma and in small intestine tissue 4 hours after establishing the lung injury model.
