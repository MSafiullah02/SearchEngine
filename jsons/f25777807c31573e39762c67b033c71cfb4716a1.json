Lesions and persistent inflammation often lead to fibrosis and can cause irreversible damage to surrounding tissues, resulting in IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, kidney disease, and other serious visceral injury and dysfunctions [7, 8] . Glucocorticoids are the first-line agent for all patients with active, untreated IgG4-RD unless contraindications to such treatment are present, and the combination of glucocorticoids and a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent is needed for some patients [8] .

In addition, the majority of the patients in our study had at least one chronic medical condition, such as hypertension and diabetes. The available data at present suggested that advanced age, male sex and chronic comorbidities are risk factors of mortality in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection [17] [18] [19] .

However, high-dose corticosteroids may be associated with increased risks of secondary infections, long-term complications, and prolonged virus shedding in COVID-19 patients [22] . In fact, it has been reported that the duration of viral RNA clearance as detected in oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples was longer in glucocorticoid treatment group than that in non-glucocorticoid treatment group [23] . In our study, patient 2 took a long time for SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid to turn negative, which may implicated that the viral load in such patients may need to be monitored for a longer time after discharge. Besides, the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools may take a longer time compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs [23] , it is better to test the viral RNA in stools or in combination with oropharyngeal swabs.",

The involved organs include sinuses, lacrimal, submandibular gland and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, with an IgG4-RD RI score of 15 at the first visit. On the last on-site visit, both patients showed a significant remission of symptoms, with the IgG4-RD RI scores dropped to 1 and 6, respectively.

Neither of them had running nose, diarrhea, myalgia or dyspnea. For laboratory inspection, the number and percentages of white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocytes of Patient 1 were in the normal range while they were slightly reduced in patient 2 (Figure 2). Both patients had significant elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), while their procalcitonin were normal. Besides, patient 1 showed a decreased serum albumin level and elevated levels of LDH. Imaging examination of Chest CT scan showed a mixed pattern of ground glass opacities and multiple patchy high density shadows in both lungs of these two patients (Figure 2). Their diagnosis of COVID-19 were soon confirmed by positive SARS-CoV RNA test. According to the Guidance for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (6th edition), both of the IgG4-RD patients were classified as having moderate type of COVID-19.During hospitalization, they were both treated with antivirus agent (oseltamivir 75mg bid po for patient 1; ganciclovir 0.5g qd ivdrip, oseltamivir 75mg bid po and recombinant human interferon a-2b 5 million U qd IM for patient 2), antibiotics (moxifloxacin 0.4g qd ivdrip), and Chinese medicinal formulae. Patient 1 was also given intravenous transfusion of albumin(10g/d for 4 days) and immunoglobulin (10g/d for ten days). Their symptoms were gradually relieved within two weeks after treatment. The inflammation lesions in the lungs of patient 1 peaked at day 4 after admission and then gradually absorbed, while lung lesions in patient 2 continuously improved since admission(Figure 2). Patient 1 was discharged after 17 days of hospital stay after two consecutive negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. Patient 2 had twice weak positive of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid intermittently after the symptoms disappeared, and was discharged after 36 days of hospital stay(Figure 2).Both patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid antibodies IgG while negative for IgM one month later.

However, the decline in white blood cells and lymphocytes in IgG4-RD patients may not be as typical and significant as other COVID-19 patients. The disease activity of IgG4-RD may also affect the recovery process of COVID-19. On the last on-site visit, patient 1 had a much lower IgG4-RD RI score than patient 2. Although patient 2 was younger, it took a longer time for him to recover from COVID-19. It is worth noting that neither of them developed primary disease relapse nor progressed to severe or critical condition of COVID-19 under the condition of continuous oral low-dose of glucocorticoids. This may be in part due to their prompt hospitalization, and it might also indicate that long-term oral low-dose of glucocorticoid may not be the risk factor for accelerating disease progression of COVID-19.",
