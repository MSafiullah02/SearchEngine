            "text": "Toxic dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium are the primary organisms responsible for harmful algal blooms (HABs) (Du et al., 2002; Usup et al., 2002). Moreover, for some reasons, such HABs appear to be increasing in frequency, intensity and distribution (John et al., 2003). HABs are now recognized worldwide as having serious implications for seafood safety, and environmental and economic concerns. In addition to the formation of red tides, some species of dinoflagellates produce a range of toxins that are poisonous to organisms higher in the food chain (Taroncher-oldenburg & Anderson, 2000). Marine dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium include a number of species responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning (Judge et al., 1993). Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), produced by Alexandria, are potent neurotoxins that can be concentrated by filter-feeding shellfish (Gallacher et al., 1997). Consumption of PST-contaminated shellfish may cause muscular paralysis, neurological symptoms and, in extreme cases, death (Anderson, 1997; Pierce & Kirkpatrick, 2001). HAB events have been reported from the South China Sea, where Hong Kong and other coastal cities have suffered considerable economic losses from frequent occurrences of HABs, some of which have been highly toxic (Anderson et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2003).",

Monitoring coastal waters for the presence of HAB species is essential in assessing the potential for bloom formation. Traditionally, this type of monitoring involves morphological identification and bioluminescence capacity, mating compatibility and enumeration of target species by light or electron microscopy in addition to toxicity tests of shellfish (Anderson et al., 1994). However, these identification methods can be difficult for long-term monitoring and the characteristic morphological features are often difficult to determine because they can be influenced by environmental factors and culture conditions (Taylor & Fukuyo, 1998).",

Because of their rapidity, PCR-based methods, molecular probes, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and immunological techniques using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been widely studied for the detection of toxic Alexandrium species (Nagasaki et al., 1991; Judge et al., 1993; Penna & Magnani, 1999; Bowers et al., 2000; Coyne et al., 2001; Godhe et al., 2001; Galluzzi et al., 2004; John & Medlin 2005). Although these techniques have significantly increased the ability to detect toxic Alexandrium species, their requirement for a high-precision instrument for amplification is complicated and costly. Immunological techniques require the identification of a phenotypic epitope, which may be influenced by the environment (Hosoi-Tanabe & Sako, 2005). This has prevented their widespread use in field laboratories, for example, as a routine diagnostic tool. Therefore, recent studies of Alexandrium species have focused on the search for better methods of identification.",

The principle of LAMP is autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis in the presence of Bst DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity under isothermal conditions between 60 and 65 \u00b0C within 60 min. The detailed amplification mechanism has been described elsewhere (Notomi et al., 2000; Mori et al., 2001; Enosawa et al., 2003; Parida et al., 2004). The reaction relies on recognition of the DNA target by six independent regions, making this kind of assay highly specific. The LAMP assay is rapid and the amplification efficiency is equivalent to that of PCR-based methods (Nagamine et al., 2002; Poon et al., 2004). More importantly, the approach is less costly, and all reactions can be developed in an isothermal environment. The potential applications of LAMP methodology have been demonstrated in recent years (Maruyama et al., 2003; Maeda et al., 2005; Ohtsuka et al., 2005). Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using the LAMP technique to detect toxic Alexandrium species.",

Prorocentrum donghaiense PD01 and Karenia mikimotoi KM01 were used to determine the specificity of LAMP detection. All strains were maintained in f/2 medium (Guillard & Ryther, 1962) at 20\u00b11 \u00b0C. Cool-white fluorescent bulbs provided light on a standard 12/12-h light\u2013dark cycle. Between 8 and 15 days after inoculation, when cultures were in the exponential phase of growth, algal cell density was accurately determined by enumeration using a 0.1-mL Plankton count box. Algal cells were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C.",

The primers used in this study were designed by an alignment of all available ITS1\u20135.8S\u2013ITS2 rRNA gene sequences for the genus Alexandrium. Sequences were downloaded from GenBank or obtained from the literature. The alignment was constructed by using clustalw. The alignment included sequences of several strains of A. minutum, A. tamarense, A. catenella and A. andersoni. The 5.8S region is very conserved among these species. A set of four primers was designed to target six conserved sequences of the 5.8S region. In order to confirm the sequence specificity, we used the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (blast) to search the GenBank and DDBJ databases for all published sequences identical to the primers. The primers were selected based on the criteria described by Notomi et al. (2000). In addition to the general criteria of primer design, such as 40\u201360 mol% G+C content but avoiding terminal dimer formation, 3\u2032 hairpins, and self-complementarity, special care was taken to adjust the melting temperatures (Tm) of the primers in such a way that the Tm values were in the following order: F1C and BIC>F2 and B2>F3 and B3. The inner primers are described as forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP). The forward inner primer consisted of the complementary sequence of F1C (25 nt), a T-T-T-T linker and F2 (19 nt). The backward inner primer consisted of B1C (24 nt), a T-T-T-T linker and the complementary sequence of B2 (20 nt). The outer primers were F3 and B3, which located outside of the F2 and B2 regions, respectively. The primer sequences and locations are indicated in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The primers were synthesized commercially by Invitrogen biotech (Guangzhou, China).",

Compared with conventional PCR, the LAMP assay reported here is advantageous owing to its simple operation, rapid reaction and ease of detection. The LAMP assay is a simple detection tool in which the reaction is carried out in a single tube by mixing the thermopol buffer, primers and Bst DNA polymerase, and incubation of the mixture at 65 \u00b0C for 1 h. There is no need for a thermal cycler because there is no heat denaturation step of the template DNAs with this method. The only equipment needed for the LAMP reaction is a regular laboratory water bath or a heating block that can provide a constant temperature of 65 \u00b0C. Although there is no need for a thermal cycler, some of the double-stranded DNA seems to become single-stranded at high temperatures in the presence of high concentrations of betaine, a reagent that facilitates DNA strand separation because it stabilizes DNA (Nagamine et al., 2001).",

The sensitivity of LAMP was less affected by various components of the clinical samples than was PCR; therefore, DNA purification from samples could be omitted (Kaneko et al., 2007).
