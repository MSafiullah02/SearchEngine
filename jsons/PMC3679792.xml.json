In animals, miRNAs usually bind to complementary sites in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of specific target genes, resulting in inhibited protein expression and induced target mRNA degradation\n[8]. MiRNAs have emerged as key regulators of diverse biological processes, including development\n[9], cancer\n[10], immune response\n[8,11] and so on. Special miRNAs have been reported to participate in regulating cross-talk between the host and the pathogen in viral infections and have a major function in viral pathogenesis\n[12-14]. For influenza virus, differential expression of cellular miRNAs have been found both in avian influenza virus-infected chickens\n[15,16] and reconstructed 1918 influenza virus\n[17] or the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus\n[18] infected mice. Several cellular miRNAs, such as miR-323, miR-491, miR-654, and Let-7c have recently been reported to inhibit H1N1 influenza A virus replication by downregulating the viral gene expression in infected MDCK or A549 cells\n[19,20]. In addition, temporal- and strain-specific host miRNA molecular signatures have been demonstrated in human A549 cells infected with swine-origin influenza pandemic H1N1 (2009) and highly pathogenic avian-origin influenza H7N7 (2003)\n[21]. However, it is still unclear whether miRNAs also play an important role in human being infected with influenza virus, especially critically ill patients caused by influenza virus infection.",

The leukocytes can interact and communicate with practically every tissue so that these cells have rich information regarding inflammation and immune responses. Gene expression profiling in peripheral blood has been used to describe the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including influenza, and to discover unique signatures of disease or to identify novel drug targets for treatment\n[22-33]. Influenza A virus can infect and replicate in human primary dendritic cell (DC), macrophages, and natural killer cells\n[34-36]. Therefore, it is appropriate to use PBMC for gene expression profiling, and it holds great promise for clinical diagnosis and research\n[22].",

In the current study, we used both miRNA microarray and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR)-based approaches to assess miRNA expression in PBMCs from the critically ill patients with H1N1 infection, and found some differentially expressed miRNAs that can be highly related to influenza virus infection. We subsequently constructed a direct gene interaction network to illustrate the interaction mechanism of these miRNA targets with each other via protein-protein interaction during influenza virus infection. This network revealed potential important functions that miRNAs have in host and pathogen interactions, and provided several directions for further study. We then validated several hub genes in the network using the qRT-PCR method and demonstrated that the hub genes, which are highly important during influenza virus infection, can be modulated by multiple miRNAs.",

We collected samples as soon as patients were admitted to ICU with confirmed influenza A H1N1 infection, when they were very severe and immediately treated with anti-infective therapy and so on. Interestingly, we found all the critically ill patients in our study were overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2). Many reports support the view that obesity is associated with higher risks of ICU admission and death in patients with influenza A (H1N1) infection\n[67-69]. Other findings suggest that obese patients with severe infection were more likely to develop pneumonitis compared to non-obese patients\n[70-72]. Infection with influenza virus in diet-induced obese mice was shown to dysregulate immune response, expecially impair the T cell memory response, and lead to increased morbidity and mortality from viral infection\n[73-75]. A recent study reported that the expression of miR-146b-5p was decreased in monocytes during obesity\n[76]. MiR-146b-5p acts as an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammation and is necessary for the anti-inflammatory action of high levels of globular adiponectin. Another group found that let-7g was downregulated in the fetal muscle of diet-induced obese ovine compared to control. The downregulation of let-7g may enhance intramuscular adipogenesis during fetal muscle development in the setting of maternal obesity\n[77]. Taken together, our findings suggest the downregulation of miR-146b-5p and let-7g were important in further understanding the molecular mechanisms implicated in obese patients susceptive to severe infection of H1N1 influenza virus.",

Studies have shown that influenza virus infection activates MAPK family members in mammals, and the expression of RANTES, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were controlled by p38 activation\n[82]. P38 MAPK is a determinant of virus infection, which depends on MyD88 expression and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligation, and the inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling significantly inhibits virus replication\n[83]. However, in our study, MAPK14 mRNA expression in critically ill patients had no significant change compared with healthy controls, indicating that the response and the regulation of key gene expression for survival in H1N1 critically ill patients is highly complex. P38 MAPKs (MAPK11, MAPK13, and MAPK14) were found to be regulated by miR-769-5p, miR-146b-5p, let-7g, miR-30b, miR-31, miR-361-3p, and miR-362-3p (Figure \n7), which were all down expressed in H1N1 critically ill patients.

A systems biology approach to infectious disease research, which models various interacting component networks, will permit greater understanding of the molecular mechanism and the interplay between the host and pathogen. In our study, with integrated various information (miRNA targets, miRNA-mediated pathways, virus proteins, et al.), we obtained a combined network of core information related to H1N1 infection. A better understanding of the network of genes and cellular pathways regulated by these miRNAs will undoubtedly enable us to characterize the host antiviral mechanism comprehensively and to find new targets for developing antiviral compounds.",

Using RT-PCR analysis, we verified nine important differentially expressed miRNAs and validated seven core genes. ROC curve analyses revealed that miR-31, miR-29a and miR-148a all had significant potential diagnostic value for critically ill patients infected with H1N1 influenza virus, which yielded AUC of 0.9510, 0.8951 and 0.8811, respectively. In addition, we found that a number of genes and signaling pathways that are important to influenza virus infection are likely to be regulated, at least partly, by miRNAs. Finally, we constructed an influenza virus-related miRNA-mRNA regulatory network, which can lead to a global perspective for investigating influenza virus infection.",
