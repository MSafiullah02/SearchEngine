            "text": "Previous studies of fetal death with maternal influenza have been inconsistent. We explored the effect of maternal influenza-like illness (ILI) in pregnancy on the risk of fetal death, distinguishing between diagnoses during regular influenza seasons and the 2009/2010 pandemic and between trimesters of ILI. We used birth records from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to identify fetal deaths after the first trimester in singleton pregnancies (2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013). The Norwegian Directorate of Health provided dates of clinical influenza diagnoses by primary-health-care providers, whereas dates of laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1) diagnoses were provided by the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases. We obtained dates and types of influenza vaccinations from the Norwegian Immunisation Registry. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of fetal death, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing women with and without an ILI diagnosis in pregnancy. There were 2510 fetal deaths among 417,406 eligible pregnancies. ILI during regular seasons was not associated with increased risk of fetal death: adjusted HR = 0.90 (95% CI 0.64-1.27). In contrast, ILI during the pandemic was associated with substantially increased risk of fetal death, with an adjusted HR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.21-2.54). The risk was highest following firsttrimester ILI (adjusted HR = 2.28 [95% CI 1.45-3.59]). ILI during the pandemic-but not during regular seasons-was associated with increased risk of fetal death in the second and third trimester. The estimated effect was strongest with ILI in first trimester.",

However, there is conflicting evidence of associations with perinatal outcomes, as findings are inconsistent across studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . A US study of respiratory illness in pregnant women found no statistically significant association between respiratory hospitalization during influenza seasons in 1985-1993 and fetal 1 3 death [7] . In a Danish study of the temporal association between influenza activity and frequency of fetal death in 1994-2009, there was no statistically significant correlation between time series of weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation proportions and time series of weekly proportions of spontaneous abortions or stillbirths [11] . On the other hand, a US study of pregnant women hospitalized during influenza seasons in 1998-2008 demonstrated increased odds of intrauterine fetal demise among delivery hospitalizations complicated by respiratory illness compared to non-respiratory delivery hospitalizations [12] . However, this study was considered to be at a very high risk of diagnostic ascertainment bias [2] .",

Large population-based registries are crucial to the surveillance of a variety of exposures and outcomes, particularly when clinical trials are not possible.

More precisely, we lacked confirmation that the R80 diagnoses reflected true influenza infections, as they are based mostly on clinical symptoms and not routinely laboratoryconfirmed. However, other ICPC-2 codes for unspecific symptoms such as \"upper respiratory infection, acute\" (R74), \"cough\" (R05), and \"fever\" (A03) are much more commonly used in primary health care, suggesting that a code for influenza is based on a more thorough evaluation of the clinical picture. Although only a small fraction of patients had laboratory confirmation of influenza, primaryhealth-care physicians are instructed to consider whether there is influenza in close contacts or an ongoing influenza epidemic, in addition to other relevant criteria for influenza, before assigning a diagnosis (Online Resource 1). Even so, some R80 diagnoses may be a result of similar symptoms caused by other respiratory viruses (i.e., differential diagnoses of influenza virus infection). To increase the reliability of influenza infections, we therefore discarded all R80 diagnoses in pregnancy made outside the predefined influenza seasons under study. This reduced the number of birth records in the study sample with at least one influenza diagnosis in pregnancy by 6.5%: from 12,728 to 11,896 birth records. Moreover, all influenza diagnoses were limited to women seeking medical care, and with that, we no doubt misclassified cases of asymptomatic/subclinical or mild, less severe infections of influenza as unexposed. Hence, we expect the current study to reflect associations with more severe influenza.",

The estimated annual seasonal influenza vaccine coverage in the general Norwegian population in 2006-2017 was approximately 10% (unpublished data based on distributed doses, unused doses, and vaccinations registered in SYSVAK). Uptake is likely to be higher in defined risk groups. It is conceivable that vaccination might affect the risk of fetal death while simultaneously reducing the risk of ILI in the pregnant woman, thereby confounding the association between maternal influenza during pregnancy and risk of fetal death. However, the low completeness of seasonal influenza vaccinations reported to SYSVAK limited our ability to include these in our study. Pandemic vaccination has previously been shown not to be associated with increased risk of fetal death [18] . Accordingly, adjustment for pandemic vaccination in the current study had little impact on the estimates for pandemic influenza in the supplementary analyses restricted to mid-May 2009 through September 2010, indicating that pandemic vaccination may not be an important confounder in this respect.",
