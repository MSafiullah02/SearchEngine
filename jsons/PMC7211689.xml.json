SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a novel enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus [2]. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly present with respiratory tract symptoms, with complications related to cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3]. Numerous case reports have been published to date that described the clinical characteristics of COVID-19. To our knowledge, these are the first two cases presenting initially as an isolated muscle weakness with increased CK, without fever or respiratory symptoms.",

Patient denies muscle pain, respiratory symptoms, fever, chills and rigors. She had no recent travel or known sick exposure. Initial vital signs were stable and initial physical examination was only notable for decrease air entry to the lungs bilaterally with rhonchi and crackles bilaterally. Laboratory findings noted to have elevated troponin of 0.663 ng/ml (0.00\u20130.45 ng/ml) with electrocardiogram (EKG) not showing any ischemic changes. Total CK was elevated to 2767 U/L (38\u2013176 U/L), hypernatremia of 152 mmol/L (136\u2013145 mmol/L), elevated AST and ALT 198 U/L (10\u201336 U/L) and 63 (6\u201329 U/L) respectively as well as elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine to 31 mg/dl (6\u201324 mg/dl) and 1.2 mg/dl (05\u20131.0 mg/dl) respectively. Complete blood count otherwise within normal limits. Urinalysis was positive for blood with no red blood cells seen microscopically. Chest X-ray performed at baseline showed left lower patchy opacities (Fig. 1\n). Based on the troponin elevation and non-specific symptoms in elderly, patient was loaded with aspirin 324 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg and heparin drip for possible acute coronary symptoms. The next day, patient underwent echocardiogram which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35\u201340% with hypokinesis of the basal to mid anterior and anteroseptal wall, in addition to a linear density in the descending aorta that can represent an aortic dissection. A CT angiogram was done to clarify the echocardiogram findings, no evidence of dissection or aneurysmal changes in the descending aorta but it showed multiple bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities (Fig. 2\n). Subsequently, nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was sent and result came back positive. Inflammatory markers including LDH, CRP, DDimer and Ferritin were markedly elevated to 497 U/L (122\u2013222 U/L), 3.7 mg/dl (0.0\u20130.8 mg/dl), 573 ng/ml (0.0\u2013500 ng/ml) and 2134 ng/ml (11\u2013307 ng/ml) respectively. Patient was then treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, vancomycin and intravenous cefepime. Also, chest physiotherapy and prone position were encouraged. On day three, patient became more lethargic and noted to have acute encephalopathy with increasing oxygen requirement, she was upgraded to the intensive care unit for close hemodynamically monitoring, supplemental oxygen and continue on supportive care. She also received fluids intermittently with close monitoring of kidney functions and CK level. Patient's oxygenation was improving, CK trending down. She was clinically improved, inflammatory markers were down-trending with normalized CK on discharge.",

Patient complained of intermittent leg twitching associated with tingling and numbness sensation at the lateral portion of the upper thigh radiating down to the posterior mid-calf. Otherwise, he denied any hematuria, respiratory symptoms, fever, chill, and rigors. Patient also denied tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug use. Initial vital signs were unremarkable, he was afebrile, hemodynamically stable and saturating well on room air. Physical examination including neurological examination was unremarkable. Nonetheless, he had decrease air entry to the lungs bilaterally with crackles heard diffusely. Chemistry profile showed an increase CK level to 1859, with elevated BUN and creatinine to 78 mg/dl and 3.6 mg/dl from the baseline of 27 mg/dl and 1.9 mg/dl. Troponin was mildly elevated to 0.249 ng/ml. Urinalysis was positive for blood with few red blood cells. Complete blood counts were within normal limits except for the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio of 7.3. EKG showed new onset atrial fibrillation with controlled heart rate. CT head showed old right lacunar infarct with no evidence of acute event. Chest x-ray showed signs of multifocal pneumonia with suspicion of COVID-19 (Fig. 3\n). Subsequently nasopharyngeal swab for COVID 19 was sent which came back positive. Inflammatory markers including LDH, DDimer, ferritin and CRP were markedly elevated to 538 U/L, 989 ng/ml, 1003 ng/ml and 18.8 mg/dl, Procalcitonin was elevated to 9.65 ng/ml (0.0\u20130.05 ng/ml). Patient was started on doxycycline, ceftriaxone and Hydroxychloroquine. He received 1.5 l bolus of normal saline on admission for rhabdomyolysis. Patient had a spike of fever the next day with progressive worsening kidney function. Creatinine was elevated to 5.6 but total CK was down-trending. Patient has a CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc Score for atrial fibrillation stroke risk of 4 and was then started on metoprolol tartrate 25 mg BID and therapeutic dose of heparin. He was deteriorated on Day 3 of admission (tachypneic at rate of 40, tachycardic, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate at of 160\u2013170 beats per minute and oxygen saturation was 89% on non-rebreather mask 100%, which ultimately lead to mechanical ventilation. Kidney functions continued to deteriorate, and the patient was started on hemodialysis. Inflammatory markers peaked 4 to 6 days after his admission and then started to trend down. Patient was still mechanical ventilated with FiO2 50%, PEEP 8 and tidal volume of 450 at the time of writing this case.",
