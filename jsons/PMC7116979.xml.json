In particular, recent global illnesses caused by viral respiratory infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1), have led to concern regarding airborne viral infections [2], [3]. Since virus particles, which are infectious and toxigenic [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], are only nanometers in size, they can remain suspended in the air long enough to be dispersed [9]. Since airborne infection is caused by these infectious aerosol particles, and the average person spends most of his/her time indoors [10], development of efficient air control technology is important for maintaining a clean indoor air environment and for preventing infection and spread of respiratory infectious diseases.",

In our previous study, aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 virus was inactivated with synthesized SiO2-Ag nanoparticles, which were 400 nm silica particles decorated with 30 nm silver nanoparticles [15]. These particles were coated onto filter media using a conventional flow process, and the anti-viral ability of the fabricated filter was tested in the continuous airflow condition. However, in that study, all of the experiments were performed in clean air without consideration of dust particles. According to a report from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), dust particles can affect the growth of microorganisms captured on an antimicrobial-treated air filter [16]. Moreover, dust particles captured on the filter media can decrease the anti-microbial ability of a silver nanoparticle-coated air filter and increase the pressure drop across filter media [17].",

The method is one of the mechanical methods using electrical discharge. When a high voltage is applied to a pair of close-set silver electrodes, a spark is produced between the two electrodes. The ions and electrons, which are accelerated by the electric field, impact the surface of the silver node and lead to vaporize electrode surface. The metallic vapors cool downstream from the spark.

In this study, the supply voltage and current were set to 2 kV and 5 mA, respectively. The particle concentration upstream (C\nup) and downstream (C\ndown) of the filter sample were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS, TSI Inc., USA) that consisted of a classifier controller (3080, TSI Inc., USA), a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, 3085, TSI Inc., USA), a condensation particle counter (CPC, 3775, TSI Inc., USA), and an aerosol charge neutralizer (Soft X-ray charger 4530, HCT Co., Ltd., Republic of Korea). The coating areal density (\u03c1\nagent) of silver nanoparticles on the filter surface was controlled by coating time and was calculated according to the following equation:(7)\u03c1agent=Q\u0394tc(Cup\u2212Cdown)Awhere Q is the flow rate, \u0394t\nc is the coating time, and A is the area of the filter.",

            "text": "In this study, Arizona road dust was used for dust loading. Arizona road dust is the compound used in the standardized air cleaner test (ISO 1203-1) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) test. Arizona road dust consists of 68\u201376% SiO2, 10\u201315% Al2O3, and 2% to 5% Fe2O3. This composition is very similar to that of the atmosphere [30], [31]. The test dust particles were aerosolized by a lab-made dust feeder that consisted of an Erlenmeyer flask and a magnetic stirrer and were flowed into the test duct at a volumetric flow rate of 5 LPM (Fig. 1b). The weight of the filter sample before and after dust loading was measured by an electronic precision balance (AR2140, OHAUS Corp., USA) in order to determine the loaded amount of dust. The pressure drop across the air filter sample at 5 LPM of air flow rate (velocity with no dust loading = 0.05 m/s) was measured by a digital pressure measuring device (Model 435-1, Testo, Germany), as shown in Fig. 1c, and the measured pressure drop was compared with the theoretical prediction carried out using the following equation [32]:(8)\u0394P=4\u03bc\u03b1Lu0(1+1.996Kn)0.25df2{\u22120.5ln\u03b1\u22120.75+\u03b1\u2212\u03b124+1.996Kn(\u22120.5ln\u03b1\u22120.25+\u03b124)}where L is the depth of the filter, \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of air, d\nf is the diameter of the filter fiber, Kn is the Knudsen number, and u\n0 is the media velocity, which can be defined as Q/A(1\u2212\u03b1). The filter solidity, \u03b1, can be modeled according to the following equation:(9)\u03b1=\u03b1\u2032+\u03b1dustwhere \u03b1\u2032 is the solidity of a clean filter (without dust loading), and \u03b1dust refers to the solidity added by the dust loading, which is defined by the following equation:(10)\u03b1dust=volume of loaded dustvolume of the sample=\u03c1dustA/\u03c1pALIn this study, effective dust particle density, \u03c1\np, was set as 3.1 g/cm3 based on the chemical composition of Arizona road dust. Generally, a used filter is replaced when the pressure drop across the filter doubles that of the initial state. Thus, four cases of dust loading, 0 (without dust), 645 \u00b1 86, 920 \u00b1 98, and 1478 \u00b11 28 \u03bcg/cm2 were selected (the pressure drop increased by approximately two times higher when \u03c1\ndust\n = 1478 \u00b1 128 \u03bcg/cm2). Medium grade glass fiber filters with a 0.04 \u00b1 0.005 cm thickness, 0.0095 \u00b1 0.0003 solidity, and 1.08 \u00b1 0.36 \u03bcm fiber diameter, were chosen as the test filter media.",

The media velocity for the case of no dust loading was set at 0.05 m/s, which is the typical media velocity for the woven-type filters used in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The mode diameter, geometric standard deviation, and number concentration of aerosolized MS2 virus were approximately 23 nm, 1.58, and 5.23 \u00d7 105 particles/cm3, respectively. Filtration efficiencies of fabricated air filter samples are shown in Fig. 3\n. The filtration efficiency increased with increasing dust amount (\u03c1\ndust), while the efficiency was not much affected by the number of silver nanoparticles coated on the filter sample (\u03c1\nagent). In previous research, the filtration efficiency of a dust loaded filter was described as follows [34]:(13)\u03b7filt=1\u2212P0exp[\u2212\u03b2\u03c1dust]where P0 is the penetration for the special case of no dust loading (unused filter), and \u03b2 is a constant representing filter performance and depends on the filter material.

Fig. 4\nshows that the pressure drop increased with increasing dust load. As with filtration efficiency, the number of coated silver nanoparticles did not have any significant effect on the pressure drop. In this study, the increase in solidity induced by silver nanoparticles coated on a filter sample was on the order of 10\u22127, while the increase in solidity caused by dust loading was on the order of 10\u22122, which was slightly higher than that of the pristine filter (\u03b1'\u22450.0095).

In this study, two different filter quality factors, filtration quality factor (q\nfilt) and anti-viral quality factor (q\nantiviral,15), were calculated using the following equations:(14)qfilt=ln(1/(1\u2212\u03b7filt)\u0394P\n(15)qantiviral,15=ln(1/(1\u2212\u03b7antiviral,15)\u0394PUsing the results of Figs. 3, 4, and 6a, these two quality factors were calculated, and the results are shown in Fig. 7\n.

For this, filtration and anti-viral tests were carried out after preparing filter samples with different amounts of silver nanoparticles and dust loading. However, in a real situation, the areal density of loaded dust (\u03c1\ndust) increases with filter operation time (t). When dust particles are deposited on the filter, the areal density of loaded dust can be calculated as(16)\u03c1dust(t)=M\u02d9\u2032\u2032depo\u00d7t\n",
