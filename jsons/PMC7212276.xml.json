In January 2020, a group of scientists demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for COVID-19 [17\u201321]. However, COVID-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding motif (particularly Gln493) which provide advantageous interactions with human ACE2 [15]. This difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than other viruses.",

The core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized B-cell and T-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. A B-cell epitope of a target molecule can be linked with a T-cell epitope to make it immunogenic. The T-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids), whereas the B-cell epitopes can be proteins [27, 28]. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to design a peptide-based vaccine to predict epitopes from the corona envelope (E) protein using immunoinformatics analysis [29\u201334]. Rapid further studies are recommended to prove the efficiency of the predicted epitopes as a peptide vaccine against this emerging infection.",

Analysis of epitopes binding to the MHC class I and II molecules was assessed by the IEDB MHC prediction server at http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/ and http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/, respectively. All conserved immunodominant peptides binding to the MHC I and II molecules at scores equal or less than 100 median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and 1000, respectively, were selected for further analysis while epitopes with IC50 greater than 100 were eliminated [46].",

The Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) was used to analyze human coronavirus (HCoV-HKU1) reference sequence vs. Wuhan-Hu-1 COVID-19. Results obtained (Figure 2) revealed extensive mutations among the tested genomes. New genes (ORF8 and ORF6) were found inserted in COVID-19 which were absent in HCoV-HKU1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission [70]. The high rate of mutation between the two genomes was observed in the region from 20,000 bp to the end of the sequence. This region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are the envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and spike (S) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [71, 72].",
