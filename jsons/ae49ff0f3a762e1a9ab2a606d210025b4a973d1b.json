Design: Descriptive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. Setting: Academic research department and clinical diagnostic laboratory. Patients/Animals: None. Focused on previously generated gene and protein expression data. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Identification of cell types co-expressing the key ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes and proteins, as well as other candidates potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Results: Based on single cell RNA sequencing data, co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not detected in testicular cells, including sperm. A subpopulation of oocytes in non-human primate ovarian tissue were found to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but co-expression was not observed in ovarian somatic cells. RNA expression of TMPRSS2 in 18 samples of human cumulus cells was shown to be low or absent. There was general agreement between publicly available bulk RNA and protein datasets in terms of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression patterns in testis, ovary, endometrial and placental cells. Conclusion: These analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is unlikely to have long-term effects on male and female reproductive function. While the results cannot be considered definitive they imply that procedures in which oocytes are collected and fertilized in vitro are associated with very little risk of viral transmission from gametes to embryos and may indeed have the potential to minimize exposure of susceptible reproductive cell types to infection when compared to natural conception.",

Investigations into the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been rapidly initiated and several key facts are already known. Viral entry requires the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; [2] [3] [4] . Host proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are then needed to cleave the viral S protein to induce a conformational change to S that allows for permanent fusion of the viral and host cell membranes (2, 4) . The importance of TMPRSS2 has been confirmed and is evident in studies showing that its inhibition blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry and spread in targeted lung cells (4) .",

Co-expression has also been reported in other tissue types, including the ileum, heart and kidney for which there are also established COVID-19 symptoms (5, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) .

Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 has been shown in testicular, endometrial and placental cells with varying interpretations (7, 11) . To our knowledge, expression of SARS-CoV-2 host entry proteins has not been assessed in human or non-human primate ovaries; specifically, the outer ovarian cortex which houses the germ cells (PubMed/MEDLINE). Reproductive indices are not typically assessed in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting and any effects of COVID-19 on fertility may not be readily apparent until epidemiological data becomes available. Therefore, we used publicly available scRNAseq data, our own unpublished transcriptomic data and publicly available bulk RNA and proteomics data in order to assess the expression patterns of viral host entry proteins in reproductive cell populations. We also considered expression of the receptor basigin (BSG/CD147), as limited data suggests it may have the capacity to mediate viral entry (15) , and also the cysteine protease cathepsins L (CatL; gene symbol: CTSL), which potentially cleaves the viral S protein (2, 4) . Capthesin L does not appear to be essential for viral infection, but it is possible that residual infection in cells treated with camostat mesylate, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, may reflect S protein priming by CatL (4, 16) .",

            "text": "Since the expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in tissues studied to date is celltype specific (5), scRNAseq analyses, which reveal co-expression of these genes within individual cells, are expected to be particularly valuable to uncovering the etiology of disease. Cell types in the reproductive system have variable lifespans and cells that live for shorter periods may pose less of a threat to an individual's long-term reproductive potential if infected. For instance, somatic spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) in the testes are continuously self-renewing cells that propagate throughout male reproductive life, while differentiated spermatocytes are cleared from the reproductive system within approximately 60 days (17) . In the ovary, a cohort of ~2,000,000 oocytes exists at birth, a diminishing subset of which will persist throughout female reproductive life, a cellular lifespan measured in decades. No new oocytes are produced. In contrast, cells of the decidua (outermost lining of the endometrium) differentiate and shed in successive menstrual cycles (regularly every 21-40 days). Cell-type specific expression patterns of genes that produce viral host entry proteins, and identification of potential loci of infection within the reproductive system, are therefore necessary in order to predict whether SARS-CoV-2 is likely to have any impact on fertility. Although not definitive, findings from studies such as this may also help to predict the likelihood of human embryos becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. In the midst of the pandemic, fertility treatments in many countries have been curtailed, cancelled or even banned outright. Given the declining chances of treatment success with advancing female age, there is an urgent need to reestablish such treatments as soon as this can be safely accomplished. Understanding whether SARS-CoV-2 has the capacity to infect gametes and embryos produced in vitro is of great importance when considering the risks of natural and assisted reproduction during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Cells from each experiment were kept only if >500 genes were expressed, and <20% of reads mapped to the mitochondrial genome. The top 5000 highly variable genes were identified using the FindVariableGenes function. Data was then normalized and scaled using the SCTransform function by regressing out the percentage of mitochondrial gene content. Principal components analysis was then performed on the scaled data using the RunPCA function. To visualize \"dimensionality\" of the dataset, we plotted the principle components using an elbow plot. This indicated that PC 1-13 explained the majority of the variance in both datasets. Downstream tSNE and clustering analyses were therefore performed on PC 1-13. The FindNeighbors and FindClusters function were used for the clustering analyses. In brief, FindNeighbors constructs a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph and then determines the Jaccard similarity between any two cells. We manually assigned cell types to clusters with wellknown markers from the original studies (18, 19) . Expression of an 'average' cell in each cluster was calculated based on the normalized, scaled and centered data. The average expression reflects the mean expression in each cluster compared to all other cells.",

Consistent with previous analyses (19) , we identified seven ovarian cell types including oocytes and six somatic cell types (stromal cells, granulosa cells, smooth muscle cells, natural killer cells, macrophages and endothelial cells; Figure 2A-B) . BSG was expressed in somatic ovarian cells, while ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was restricted to germ cells ( Figure 2C) . A moderate correlation between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in ovarian cells (Pearson correlation value = 0.51) was driven entirely by expression in oocytes ( Figure 2D) . As in the original study (19) , a principle component analysis within the oocyte cluster was used to identify four subtypes of oocytes with distinct gene expression profiles ( Figure 3A) . These four clusters represented sequential developmental stages of folliculogenesis (i.e. oocytes within primordial, primary, secondary and antral follicles) as is shown by the distribution of markers known to be involved in follicular development ( Figure 3B) . The degree of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression increased with oocyte maturity: primordial (17.0% of cells, Pearson correlation value = 0.21), primary (39.0%, Pearson correlation value = 0.21), secondary (25.0%, Pearson correlation value = 0.13) and antral (62.1%, Pearson correlation value = 0.37; Figure 3B -C). Unlike lung tissue (5), ACE2 (average expression = 2.3, 100% of cells) is more broadly expressed in oocytes than TMPRSS2 (average expression = 2.2, 37.0% of cells) suggesting that the latter may be a potential limiting factor for infection of the female gamete ( Figure 3B) . Expression of the alternative protease cathepsin L (CTSL) could not be interrogated as it was not captured in the original study (absent from combined expression matrix; 19) . BSG transcripts were detected in 100% of primordial oocytes with diminishing expression across maturing oocytes ( Figure 3B ).",

Of note, each sample was comprised of all of the cumulus cells associated with a single oocyte and consequently it was not possible to determine whether genes were co-expressed in individual cells. Consistent with the non-human primate scRNAseq results, ACE2 was shown to have wide expression. Transcripts from this gene were detectable in 18/18 samples and a 'transcripts per million (tpm)' score of 24.03 was recorded. Also concordant with the primate results, expression of TMPRSS2 was found to be very low in human cumulus cells. Transcripts were completely undetectable in 15/18 samples and only expressed at a low levels in the other three samples (averaging 0.13 tpm). In contrast, BSG and CTSL transcripts were detectable in all samples (18/18) and had expression levels of 374.19 tpm and 105.45 tpm, respectively.",

The HPA measures protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while the Human Proteome Map uses a mass spectrometry-based profiling platform. Protein expression in ovarian, testicular, endometrial and placental tissue was correlated with bulk cell RNA expression data from four publicly available datasets: the HPA and GTEx datasets, which both use RNAseq, the FANTOM5 dataset, which uses cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) and the HPA consensus dataset, a consensus dataset of the other three RNA datasets.

Therefore, we decided to look at the expression patterns of known viral host entry proteins to gain an insight into the possible biological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on reproduction. Our results from scRNAseq data suggest that sperm cells may not be at increased risk of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mediated viral entry and spread, given the lack of co-expression in any testicular cell type, although we were unable to interrogate Sertoli cells. Separately, bulk RNAseq and protein platforms indicated moderate ACE2 expression in testicular tissue, while expression of TMPRSS2 was found to be low or undetectable. Alternative receptor BSG and protease capthesin L were broadly expressed in testicular cell clusters as is true in other tissue types studied to date (7) . However, it is not yet empirically determined whether cathepsin L can functionally replace the key role of TMPRSS2 in viral S protein priming (4, 5) . Our findings are consistent with a recent study, showing an absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen and testicular biopsy specimens from infected men (23) . Taken together, these results suggest that long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function are unlikely and that the risk of infection of sperm and subsequent transmission to embryos during fertilization is low.",

Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 appeared to increase as follicles progressed through development: primordial follicles had minimal co-expression, while 62% of antral follicles had co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Pearson correlation value = 0.37). These results are relatively reassuring concerning the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on female reproduction. Considering that the cells predicted to have the greatest susceptibility to infection are oocytes in antral follicles, which are either ovulated or atrophy within several days of appearance each cycle, a sustained impact on the female gamete seems unlikely. Additionally, it is important to note that oocytes within antral follicles are entirely surrounded within a mass of cumulus cells (a specialized class of granulosa cell). The non-human primate scRNAseq data suggests that such cells do not co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and may therefore provide a physical barrier to infection. Our transcriptomic data from human cumulus cells indicates that ACE2 is expressed in this cell type. Although a relatively small sample was assessed (cumulus cells from 18 oocytes in 9 women), these findings are concordant with previous research (26) . However, transcripts of TMPRSS2 are either entirely absent or exist at very low levels in cumulus cells and therefore a low risk of infection is predicted.",

As of yet, no autopsy reports in persons with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 at time of death have assessed SARS-Cov-2 replication in the reproductive system. Rather, infected tissues known to cause death in patients such as the lungs and heart have been the primary focus (27, 28) . Moreover, current pathology data is largely based upon samples from post-menopausal women and therefore cannot address the potential activity of SARS-CoV-2 in mature oocytes (since post-menopausal women have none). Further experimental data in ovarian tissue from women of reproductive age with COVID-19 is needed to confirm whether the female germ cells can be infected. It is also worth noting that detection of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA transcripts in mature oocytes may not reflect active production of the associated proteins. Translation of mRNA gradually decreases during oocyte maturation, allowing a large pool of RNA transcripts to accumulate, necessary to sustain the embryo prior to genome activation (29) .",

However, the data presented here suggests that procedures in which cumulus cell-enclosed oocytes are collected and fertilized outside the female reproductive tract (e.g. in vitro fertilization) are likely to pose very little risk and may have the potential to reduce or entirely eliminate exposure of susceptible cell types to infection. The risk of infection for primordial follicles (the ovarian reserve) appears to be low (ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression correlation value = 0.21), indicating that any possible effects of COVID-19 on fertility may be transient.",

Publicly available developmental scRNAseq databases reveal no co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in fetal tissues including liver, thymus, skin, bone marrow and yolk sac (6) . Expression of ACE2 has been documented in the placenta, but co-expression with TMPRSS2 has not been reported, suggesting that placental cells may act as a barrier to vertical SARS-CoV-2 transmission (7). These conclusions are supported by the lack of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression in endometrial and placental tissue (HPA/IHC data sets) described in this study. The limited clinical data available has also indicated a lack of vertical transmission in newborns of pregnant women who had confirmed COVID-19 in the third trimester (30) . Additionally, obstetric outcomes for babies born to mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 have not shown any impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy (31) .",

            "text": "The results presented here can only be considered indicative and require verification. Our results cannot rule out the possibility that proteases other than TMPRSS2 (including CTSL), may facilitate viral entry in some cells such as primordial oocytes (100% of which have detected ACE2 and BSG transcripts). Nonetheless, they add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that most aspects of reproduction during the COVID-19 pandemic are unlikely to be associated with increased risks of clinical complications. The amount of data currently available is small, but thus far there is no indication of an increased incidence of severe disease amongst pregnant women and obstetric outcomes for babies born to mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 appear to be within the normal range (30) . Furthermore, viral RNA has not been detected in semen or testicular biopsy specimens from infected men (23) . The results of the current study suggest that sperm and cumulus-enclosed oocytes are unlikely to be susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and consequently it should be possible to undertake oocyte collection and fertilization, followed by in vitro embryo culture and cryopreservation with minimal risk to the embryos produced. Indeed, considering the lack of knowledge concerning the risk of infection during in vivo preimplantation development, implantation and early pregnancy, it is possible that IVF may represent a safer reproductive strategy than natural conception at this time. Given that the success rates of IVF treatments decline at an ever accelerating rate as the age of the female patient increases (falling by approximately 0.3% per month from the mid-thirties, according to data from the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technologies and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority), it is imperative that delays to fertility treatments are minimized. Provided adequate precautions can be instituted to ensure the safety of patients attending fertility clinics, as well as clinical staff, it seems reasonable to consider the reintroduction of IVF treatments (at a minimum cycles involving cryopreservation of embryos) in countries where the ability of patients to access such procedures has been denied or severely limited. PC1 is plotted against PC2 and clusters were manually assigned cell types using known markers of follicular development. The dot plot (B) depicts the expression distribution of follicular development markers and TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression across oocyte sub-clusters. ATP6 and COX2 are markers of primordial follicles and are progressively downregulated during folliculogenesis. ZP1, GDF9 and BMP15 are promoters of follicular development and are progressively upregulated during folliculogenesis. Average expression represents the scaled (Pearson residuals) and centered (mean zero) expression of an average cell in each cluster and therefore contains negative and positive values. The size of the dot reflects the percentage of cells with detected mRNA transcripts. Primordial = oocytes within primordial follicles (also known as the ovarian reserve). Primary = oocytes within primary follicles. Secondary = oocytes within secondary follicles. Antral = oocytes within antral follicles. ",
