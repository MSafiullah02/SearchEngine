Although other respiratory viruses (e. g., respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus) can also cause considerable pulmonary damage, influenza virus remains the main cause of respiratory failure in patients with suspected viral respiratory tract infection. In addition, influenza virus is the only respiratory virus that has caused four pandemics over the last 100 years, making it one of the most transmissible and virulent viruses in the world. Here, we review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, current management and future therapy of severe influenza infection.",

Like most cells, epithelial cells constitutionally upregulate the interferon pathway in response to infection by viruses. Types I and III interferon pathways are the natural defense mechanism against influenza virus. Upon infection, epithelial cells upregulate interferon regulatory factors (IRF), such as IRF-3 and IRF-7. This leads to transcription and translation of a downstream interferon pathway, which in turn produces a family of interferon-stimulated genes/proteins. This vast family of interferon-stimulated genes/proteins (> 300) provides a wide spectrum of anti-viral effects, ranging from inhibition of viral replication to sensing of influenza virus inside the host cells. This response is immediate and effective, making it a critical part of the innate immune response against influenza virus.",

They phagocytose infected cells containing influenza virus and initiate other cells of innate and adaptive immunity. Failure of alveolar macrophages to mount an effective early response is associated with increased viral dissemination and increased morbidity/mortality. Neutrophils are also early responders in severe influenza infection. Similar to alveolar macrophages, failure of this early neutrophil response is a prominent feature of severe influenza infection. Paradoxically, an exuberant or inappropriately exaggerated neutrophil response is also a feature of severe influenza infection. For example, in severe H1N1 and H5N1 infection, the large influx of neutrophils into the alveolar space is a classic feature [1] . During this massive neutrophil influx, the neutrophils release a large amount of cytokines, extracellular proteases and histones. This leads to a breakdown of the epithelial barrier, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), flooding of alveolar spaces by inflammatory fluid and increased barrier to oxygenation, all of which contribute to the clinical picture of acute lung injury commonly observed in patients with severe influenza infection.",

Monocytes, for example, traffic into the infected pulmonary tissue and participate in a pro-inflammatory response. Not surprisingly, inhibition of monocytes and preventing their subsequent participation in the proinflammatory response has been shown to decrease the extent of acute lung injury in animal models [2, 3] . Pulmonary dendritic cells are another important immune cell subset that contributes to pathogenesis. In a murine model of influenza infection, pulmonary dendritic depletion increased macrophage recruitment and enhanced pro-inflammatory responses (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u02db/interleukin [IL]-6 increased 5-35 fold) [4] . In another murine model, pulmonary dendritic cells induced T-regulatory cell responses that suppressed antigen-specific CD8 cells, thereby preventing an effective immune response [5] . Hence, the pathogenic role of dendritic cells seems to be to cause a dysregulated immune response, which either causes excessive lung injury (by causing increased inflammation) or impairs the effective clearance of influenza virus (by limiting CD8 cell response).",

The basis for increased susceptibility is thought to be due to production of type I interferon, which is increased initially in response to influenza virus infection, but also decreases the synthesis of IL-1B, IL-23, IL-17 and IL-22, which in turn inhibit the production of antimicrobial peptides [9] . Furthermore, the proinflammatory milieu caused by the influx of neutrophils also contributes towards increased susceptibility to bacterial super-infection.

These biomarkers differ from conventional biomarkers (e. g., C-reactive protein [CRP] or procalcitonin [PCT] ) in that they are much more influenza specific, due to the fact that many of them are interferon derived genes, which are upregulated in response to respiratory virus infection. A recently published landmark study showed that these biomarkers could address several important clinical questions simultaneously (whereas conventional biomarkers could address only one question at a time) [10] . First, these biomarkers could assist clinicians to identify patients most likely to have infection (bacterial and viral) in a heterogeneous population of patients with undifferentiated respiratory illnesses. Second, among infected patients, the biomarkers could distinguish between bacterial and viral infection. Third, among infected patients, the biomarkers could prognosticate and predict clinical outcomes. In addition, the biomarkers could be easily measured in most clinical settings due to the ease of sampling (only 2.5 ml of whole blood is required) and the wide availability of PCR machines (to measure gene-expression). Importantly, because these biomarkers reflect changes in the immune pathway during influenza infection, they provide additional diagnostic information not offered by conventional pathogen detection assay (e. g., virus nucleic amplification). Although further validation studies are necessary before these biomarkers can be widely adopted in clinical practice, it is highly likely that they will be incorporated into the diagnostic armamentaria of modern laboratories in the future.",

Therapeutic agents for severe influenza infection are limited, with oseltamivir being the most commonly used anti-viral agent. A recent metaanalysis showed that oseltamivir could reduce symptom duration and the risk of developing lower respiratory tract complications (e. g., viral pneumonia) [11] . However, its efficacy is dependent on oseltamivir being administered in the early phase of the illness. This may pose difficulty in the management of ICU patients, because these patients often present in the late phase of their illness. Regardless of the timing of presentation, oseltamivir should be considered in all high-risk patients. The current recommendation by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that it should be administered in immunocompromised patients, patients with severe comorbidities or underlying chronic lung diseases, age < 2 or > 65 years, morbid obesity, nursing home residents, women who are pregnant or post-partum, and patients with signs of severe respiratory disease. Low-dose steroids are best avoided, as suggested by a recently published metaanalysis [12] . In this meta-analysis, the authors analyzed data from nine cohort studies (n = 1,405) and 14 case-control studies (n = 4,700). They found increased mortality associated with corticosteroid treatment in cohort studies (relative risk [RR] 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.46-2.33; p < 0.0001) and in case-control studies (odds ratio [OR] 4.22; 95% CI 3.10-5.76; p < 0.0001). This increased mortality was consistent regardless of the quality of the included studies or the sample size of the individual studies. Other worrying findings are that corticosteroid use was associated with a higher incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia, longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer hospital stay. Therefore, the use of corticosteroids in severe influenza infection is not recommended in routine clinical care and should be restricted to patients in the setting of clinical trials.",

Of particular relevance to the intensivist is the fact that the activity of the MAPK pathway is determined by the oxidative-reductive state of the host cell. N-acetylcysteine, a well-established drug already commonly used in ICU patients, could modulate the oxidative-reductive state of the host cell, thereby affecting influenza virus propagation. A recent study has demonstrated the potential efficacy of this agent in treating severe influenza infection in an animal model [14] . Other antioxidant agents, such as p38 inhibitor or glutathione, are also potential new hostbased therapeutic agents that modulate the redox balance within the host cell. In addition to the MAPK pathway, the PI3K pathway is also sensitive to the effect of redox balance. PI3K is a signaling pathway implicated in influenza infection [15] . An in vitro study showed that inhibition of this pathway could reduce influenza virus replication [16] . Importantly, PI3K inhibitors have already been approved as anticancer drugs.

Several molecular pathways are known to trigger the interferon pathway. For example, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and 7 are known to activate the interferon pathway in lung epithelium and immune cells. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, TLR7 activation produces massive interferon release at 1,000 times that of any other immune cell in the human host. Ligands that selectively target TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells could be potential therapeutic targets. Other TLR ligands, such as CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (TLR9), have been shown to protect against lethal influenza infection in experimental settings [20] . In lung epithelium, TLR3 is the dominant pathway leading to interferon pathway activation. A large number of TLR3 and TLR9 agonists are currently in clinical trial phase for the treatment of autoimmune conditions, cancer and viruses. It is possible to extend the application of these agents to treat severe influenza infection. Further investigation on these promising new agents may open the door for developing new treatments in severe influenza infection.",

The influenza virus harnesses host proteolytic enzymes to achieve this process. One example of such an enzyme is the transmembrane protease serine S1 (TMPRSS) that belongs to the type II transmembrane serine protease family. This enzyme is located in the human airway epithelium and plays an important role in permitting influenza virus to gain entry into the host cell. Consequently, a protease inhibitor that binds to the TMPRSS molecule is a potential drug target in the treatment of influenza infection. Recent studies have identified three TMPRSS molecules, namely TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11D, as potential drug targets [21] . These molecules have been detected in multiple locations within the human respiratory tract, including nasal mucosa, the trachea, the distal airway and the lung. Aprotinin, a drug familiar to most intensivists, is a protease inhibitor and has been shown to reduce influenza virus replication. In addition to reducing viral replication, aprotinin has also been shown to reduce inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a further benefit other than its impact on viral replication. So far, findings with the TMPRSS molecule have been derived mainly from in vitro models. Further studies in animal models and human clinical trials are needed in the future.",

In addition, after virus replication, neuraminidase detaches the virion from the infected cells, thereby facilitating release and subsequent spread of the viral progeny.

The vast majority of the clinical trials on these drugs were performed in non-ICU patients. Furthermore, to be effective, these drugs need to be administered during the very early phase of the disease. Consequently, the clinical utility of current neuraminidase inhibitors is limited in ICU patients. To improve the clinical utility of these drugs, a recently developed strategy has been used to increase the efficacy of the approved neuraminidase inhibitors. This strategy involved use of multivalent inhibitors and conjugating the compounds to a biocompatible polymer. Using this innovative approach, recent studies have shown that neuraminidase inhibitors significantly increase their antiviral potency, to 1,000-10,000 times higher than their predecessors [22] . If proven in clinical trials, these newer formulations could become extremely valuable in treating patients with severe influenza infection. ",

After gaining entry into the host cell, the influenza virus activates the M2 protein by sensing a drop in the pH value inside the enveloped vesicle (the endosome). The activation of the M2 proton channel results in a proton flux from the endosome into the virion core. Acidification of the virus interior leads to dissociation of the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. Subsequent membrane fusion releases the ribonucleoprotein into the cytoplasm. This release allows the virus to be imported into the nucleus to start viral replication. Other important functions of the M2 protein are: formation of the filamentous strains of the virus; release of the budding virion; and stabilization of the virion budding site. Due to these important functions, inhibition of M2 protein represents an ideal therapeutic target. A well-known licensed antiviral drug, amantadine, is an M2 blocker that binds the N-terminal channel lumen of the M2 pore resulting in repulsion of protons and subsequently prevent virus uncoating. Unfortunately, this class of drug is not active against all strains of influenza virus (e. g., influenza B). In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant virus variants has been reported. These drawbacks have significantly limited the use of M2 blockers.",
