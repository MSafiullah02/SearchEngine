Characterising the human immune response to infection is essential for identifying correlates of protection and for developing suitable animal models for vaccine development; an important component of this work is the collection of blood from survivors. Collection of appropriate volumes of antibody-rich serum from survivors are essential for the international standards and assays that are needed for vaccine (and diagnostic test) development, testing, and release, and for comparing one product (or even vaccine lot) with another. Similarly, specimen processing to obtain and analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells, although a more labour intensive process, is pivotal for the isolation and identification of light-chain and heavy-chain antibody sequences and the development of recombinant antibodies. Such specimens can also be used for the development of rapid diagnostic tests, vaccine design, therapeutics, and for the identification of correlates of protection, which can be useful as surrogate endpoints in vaccine trials. Validated measures of immune response are required before any regulatory authorisation for vaccine use can be granted. Such measures do not currently exist for Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, or Nipah virus, CEPI's initial priority pathogens, nor will they exist for the hypothetical Disease X. Ideally, the scientific community should agree on priorities for specimen analysis in advance of an outbreak, and the collection and distribution effort should be designed to serve the needs of vaccine, diagnostics, and therapeutics developers. However, if a disease outbreak occurs and consensus on an analysis plan has not been reached, specimens could be safely processed and stored, maintaining a chain of custody in a national or regional biobank until the outbreak has ended and a scientific consensus on their analysis can be achieved.",

Given the low number of and poor access to health care and laboratory infrastructure in the countries where some of the WHO priority pathogens are endemic, newer techniques that support the development of both point of care testing and antigen detection that can be used in vaccine trials (eg, next-generation sequencing and targeted genome or pathogen capture methods) should be prioritised.",

Given the sporadic and unpredictable occurrence of outbreaks, the study designs suitable to different prototypes of transmission dynamics, and infrastructure must be in place and tested before an outbreak begins. Even if vaccines are licensed through alternative pathways, such as the US Food and Drug Administration's Animal Efficacy Rule, post-licensure effectiveness data will need to be generated during outbreaks.

The activities outlined in the table should be viewed as necessary to initiate or accelerate vaccine development but they might also be useful in clarifying whether, and how far, vaccine development should proceed. Given the magnitude of investment needed to develop a new vaccine and take it to licensure, CEPI anticipates that its early funding of these types of activities will be essential for rapid decision-making processes involving a wide range of global stakeholders.

CEPI will continue to work with the international community on plans to implement vaccine trials during an outbreak once its vaccine candidates reach an appropriate stage of development, and to establish investigational vaccine stockpiles.
