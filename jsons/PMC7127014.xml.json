During the next few months, SARS spread through Asia, Europe, North and South America. More than 8000 people worldwide were infected during the 2003 outbreak, and more than 700 people died [1]. It is now believed that the sharp increase and decrease in the number of patients was caused by the existence of superspreaders. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the USA, the patients are defined as superspreaders if they infect more than 10 people [2]. Superspreaders thus have a strong effect on other people and cause wide spread of the disease. Although superspreaders are believed to play important roles in the outbreak of SARS, the biological characterization of the superspreaders have not been performed.",

In the standard model (SIR model), individuals are categorized into three groups; susceptible to the disease (S), infected with the disease (I), or recovered (R). The evolution of these states is described by difference (or differential) equations and it is assumed that the transmission rates between all pair of individuals are equal. In order to include the effect of a superspreader, the SIR model must be generalized so that the transmission rates can represent the effect of superspreaders.",

First we assume that a normal infected individual transmits his/her disease to a susceptible individual at distance r with probability in proportion to (r-r0)\u03b1 if r\u2a7dr0 and zero if r>r0, where \u03b1\u2a7e0. We consider two models for the superspreaders. In one model, the superspreader can transmit the disease with higher probability to other people within the same distance. In the other model, the superspreader can transmit disease to susceptible people at much longer distance. These models can be called the strong infectiousness model and the hub model, respectively. By Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the spread of disease as a function of population and the density of superspreaders. In Section 2, we explain our model in detail. In Section 3, results of Monte Carlo simulation are presented about the percolation probability of disease, the velocity of disease propagation, the epidemic curve and secondary infections. We compare our results with observation for the SARS outbreak in 2003 in Section 4. We conclude that the hub model can explain the observation.",

The parameter space above the critical line is the area where the disease percolates on, the other side is the area where the disease does not percolate. In order to explain the decrease of the critical density \u03c1c\u03c0r02, we introduce the basic reproductive number R0(\u03bb) which is defined as(3)R0(\u03bb)=\u03c1\u03bb\u222bwss(r)2\u03c0rdr+(1-\u03bb)\u222bwn(r)2\u03c0rdr/w0.Here wss(r) and wn(r) are the infection probability of the superspreaders and the normal individuals, respectively. This quantity R0 denotes the mean of the number of new infected individuals per unit time resulting from a single initial-infected individual. In the strong infectiousness model, if all individuals are superspreaders, the critical density \u03c1c\u03c0r02 is determined by theory of percolation [7], and we define the critical basic reproductive number as(4)Rc=\u03c1c\u03c0r02=4.5.In the hub model, we choose the critical density \u03c1c\u03c0r02 where \u03bb=1.0 as the critical basic reproductive number,(5)Rc=\u03c1c\u03c0r02=3.2.The solid and dashed curves in Fig. 5 are critical curves defined by the condition R0=Rc.

We introduced two models for superspreaders who have two kinds of distance dependence of infection probability. From Monte Carlo simulation, we have obtained the percolation probability as functions of the density \u03c1\u03c0r02 for different fraction of superspreaders \u03bb. If \u03c1\u03c0r02 is sufficiently low, the percolation probability is zero and the percolation transition appears at the critical density \u03c1c\u03c0r02. We showed the critical density \u03c1c\u03c0r02 decreases as \u03bb increases, and \u03c1c\u03c0r02 coincides with the density at the critical basic reproductive number R0=Rc. We could see the critical density of the strong infectiousness model is larger than the hub model, and in the hub model infection propagates faster than in the strong infectiousness model for any \u03bb>0. Moreover, the epidemic curves were shown that the number of infected increases rapidly with a sharp maximum if superspreaders are mixed in the system. With mixing the superspreaders, the distribution of the number of links of the infection route network have long tail and get enhanced at zero in comparison with no superspreaders. Our results were compared with the data of SARS outbreak in 2003. The feature of distribution of the number of secondary patients is similar with the distributions from our models. This result suggests that our models can be applied to simulate SARS. Moreover, from the comparison of the epidemic curve of SARS with our models, the hub model reproduces the epidemic curve similar to the data of SARS. From this result, we conclude that the social connections are important for the spreading of disease, and the superspreader has many social connections.",
