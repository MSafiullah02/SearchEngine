It is unclear whether a more aggressive clinical course might develop in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected subjects during biological therapy and current evidence does not support treatment suspension. However, during pandemic, the start of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and biologics should be postponed whenever possible and based on an individual risk assessment. When clinical conditions and the disease activity do not allow a treatment delay, before starting a biological therapy, screening of IBD patients for COVID-19 active infection by RT-PCR should be advisable, even in absence of clinical suspicion. Serum antibody testing, when available, could provide evidence of infection as well as identify patients already immune to the disease.",

Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate, with severe clinical courses and deaths being more likely in older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases (1) . Also, male gender seems to be at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. Due to the rapid spread of the disease, governments and the medical community are taking measures to prevent transmission, from common sense recommendations to radical quarantine measures (2) . Accumulating evidence shows that patients with COVID-19 infection may also experience gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort prior to the common respiratory symptoms Current recommendation suggests postponing the start of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and biologics, whenever possible, based on an individual risk assessment during the COVID19 pandemic (5-7). However, since postponing the drug start is not always possible depending on the clinical activity of the patients, particular measures should be considered in order to reduce COVID-19-related risks. A viral screen is commonly suggested before starting biologics (8) due to the higher risk of serious and opportunistic infections in IBD patients (9) (10) (11) , that becomes particularly high in patients older than 50 years (12,13).",

To corroborate, recent studies found that in more than 20% of SARS-CoV-2 patients the viral RNA remained positive in feces even after negative conversion of the viral RNA in the respiratory tract, indicating that the gastrointestinal viral infection and the potential fecal-oral transmission can last even after viral clearance in the respiratory tract (4). In keeping, it has been recommended that rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2 patients, and Transmission-Based Precautions for hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients should continue if feces test positive by rRT-PCR testing. However, the impact of the COVID-19 on chronic relapsing gastrointestinal disease is unknown. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are invited to follow the national recommendations as any other person. Elective outpatients clinics should be reorganized by institution of telemedicine services, patients should continue their medications and access to infusion centres be retained, assuming actions to avoid infection outbreaks are taken in place.",

Moreover, inhibiting anti-viral immunity by broad immunosuppression could delay virus clearance and perpetuate symptoms and illness (16). Given the uncertainties linked to the rapid and global COVID-19 outbreak it is clear that efforts should be focused on the best care we can provide to our IBD patients in general and particularly to those under immunosuppressive/ immunomodulatory treatment (5). These patients might have higher viral load, prolonged viral shedding and impaired antibody response. Raised serum antibodies against nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARSCoV-2 have been shown in most patients at 10 days or later after symptoms onset with a correlation between antibody response and neutralising antibody titre (17). Detecting serum IgM and IgG antibodies can provide historic information about viral exposure as well as diagnostic evidence.",
