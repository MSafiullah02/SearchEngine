Diarrheic calves (n = 21) were selected in the study based on the finding of diarrhea on physical examination of sick calves presented to the large animal clinic of the Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan. All diarrheic calves had access to their dam's milk before presentation to the clinic by their owners. Some had been treated with oral electrolyte solutions containing glucose, glycine and electrolytes. Twenty-one calves from a local beef farm that were normal on physical examination were used as healthy controls. Healthy calves also had access to their dam's milk. The physical condition of each scouring calf was assessed at time of entry into the study (29). The study was approved by the Animal Care Committee, University of Saskatchewan and carried out in accordance with the principles and guidelines specified by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.",

Lactic acid, pyruvic acid and acetic acid were identified based on their retention times with known standards of each acid and recovery was determine from the internal standard. Concentrations of pyruvate, acetate and lactate were determined from standard curves made with solutions of the appropriate acid (28).

Previous studies in diarrheic calves investigated the association of acidosis with L-lactate only (15, 30) and provided evidence that this was derived from tissue metabolism secondary to dehydration. The use of fast and simple HPLC methods of analysis in this study, however, afforded the simultaneous investigation of other organic acids that may contribute to metabolic acidosis.",

D-lactic acidosis was more severe than lactic acidosis in nine calves. The ages of the high L- and D-lactic acidosis groups were similar, so age-related differences in body metabolism or intestinal flora were not responsible for the difference in types of lactic acidosis in this study. Overall, increases in D- and L-lactate totaled \u223c9 mmol/L and, thus, together accounted for 9 mmol/L of the 14-mmol/L increase in anion gap.",

Malabsorption of nutrients in the small intestine of SBS patients, with subsequent fermentation by colonic bacteria results in D-lactic acidosis in humans (18, 35, 36, 37). Malabsorption and passage of undigested nutrients into the distal small intestine may cause the same process in diarrheic calves. Previous studies of diarrheic calves at our college show that many are infected by organisms known to cause villus atrophy (38) and, consequently, maldigestion and malabsorption of nutrients (39). As a result, excessive delivery of nutrients to the distal small intestine and large colon could result in bacterial overgrowth and probably D-lactic acid production. Presumably, milk lactose could be readily fermented to D- and L-lactic acids by colonic bacteria.",

The mechanisms by which these acids could be absorbed in diarrheic patients are poorly understood. There may be direct diffusion across inflamed mucosa. In addition, the mucosal monocarboxylic acid transporter transports L-lactic acid and a variety of other organic acids and transport is enhanced by low pH (40). Unlike L-lactate, metabolism of D-lactate in calves, humans and other vertebrates is slow (25) or impaired (41). Therefore, accumulation of D-lactic acid is an important contributory factor to acidosis in neonatal calves with diarrhea. Our study establishes that acidosis in diarrheic calves is due in part to D-lactic acid accumulation and that the gastrointestinal tract seems to be the site of D-lactate production. This finding was made possible by the new, fast and simple analytical approach used in this study, which made it possible to partition lactic acidosis between D and L isomers of lactic acid.",
