A newer definition of mucosal barrier injury laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (MBI-LCBI) currently is used by the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) of the CDC to distinguish bacteremia that represents translocation of gut microorganisms related to mucosal barrier injury in patients with oncologic conditions, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and intestinal failure from bacteremia associated with central venous catheters.8 HAIs can result in substantial morbidity and mortality, as well as lifetime physical, neurologic, and developmental disabilities. Host (i.e., intrinsic) factors that make children particularly vulnerable to infection include immaturity of the immune system, congenital abnormalities, and congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies. Children with congenital anomalies have a high risk of HAI if their unusual anatomic features predispose them to contamination of normally sterile sites. Moreover, these children require prolonged and repeated hospitalizations, undergo many complex surgical procedures, and have extended exposure to invasive supportive and monitoring equipment.",

Neither the benefits nor the safety of co-bedding multiple-birth infants in the hospital setting has been demonstrated.16 Overall, the infection risk is reduced with kangaroo care, but transmission of tuberculosis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has occurred in kangaroo mother care units in South Africa.17 Parents providing kangaroo care should be monitored for the presence of skin infections.",

Transmission of infectious agents by the droplet route requires exposure of mucous membranes to large respiratory droplets within 3 to 6 feet (1 to 2 m) of the infected person. Large respiratory droplets do not remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods, and they settle on environmental surfaces. The dynamics of infectious aerosols can be affected by a variety of factors including characteristics of specific strains of bacteria, temperature, humidity, and number of air exchanges in a room. Adenovirus, influenza virus, and rhinovirus are transmitted primarily by the droplet route, whereas RSV is transmitted primarily by the contact route.28 Although influenza virus can be transmitted by the airborne route under unusual conditions of reduced air circulation or low absolute humidity, ample evidence indicates that transmission of influenza is prevented by droplet precautions and, in the care of infants, the addition of contact precautions.29\n",

However, the conclusion from all published experiences during the pandemic was that droplet transmission is the usual route of transmission, and surgical masks were noninferior to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in HCP.32, 33 Concerns about unknown or possible routes of transmission of agents that can cause severe disease and have no known treatment often result in more extreme prevention strategies. Therefore, recommended precautions could change as the epidemiology of emerging agents is defined and these controversial issues are resolved.

HCP rarely are the source of outbreaks of HAIs caused by bacteria and fungi, but when they are, certain factors are usually present that increase the risk of transmission (e.g., sinusitis, draining otitis externa, respiratory tract infections, dermatitis, onychomycosis, wearing of artificial nails).35, 36, 37 Persons with direct patient contact who were wearing artificial nails have been implicated in outbreaks of P. aeruginosa and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in NICUs; therefore, the use of artificial nails or extenders is prohibited in persons who have direct contact with high-risk patients.4 Several published studies have shown that infected pediatric HCP, including resident physicians, transmitted Bordetella pertussis to other patients and can be the source of other vaccine-preventable infections in healthcare.38, 39\n",

Other MDROs (e.g., VRE, ESBLs, and CRE, especially K. pneumoniae) have emerged as the most challenging healthcare-associated pathogens in both pediatric and adult settings, and otherwise healthy children in the community can be colonized asymptomatically with these MDROs.42 GNB, including ESBL and other multidrug-resistant isolates, are more frequent than MRSA and VRE in many PICUs and NICUs. Patients who are transferred from chronic care facilities may be colonized with MDR GNB at the time of admission to the PICU. Trends in targeted MDROs are tracked in the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system (NNIS), now NHSN ICUs. HAIs caused by MDROs are associated with increased length of stay, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased cost, in part because of the delay in initiating effective antimicrobial therapy.43, 44 Although the prevalence of specific MDROs is lower in pediatric institutions, the same principles of target identification and interventions to control MDROs apply in all settings.",

There is considerable center-to-center variability in both the incidence of invasive candidiasis and the proportion of Candida infections caused by Candida non-albicans spp., most of which are resistant to fluconazole. Risk factors for Candida infections include prolonged length of stay in an ICU, use of central venous catheters, intralipids, histamine (H2)-blocking agents, and exposure to third-generation cephalosporins. GNB and Candida spp. are especially important pathogens for HAIs in patients with intestinal failure who are receiving total parenteral nutrition, and these organisms can cause repeated episodes of sepsis.

The most recently published clinical practice guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend the use of oral or intravenous fluconazole prophylaxis in infants weighing <1000 g at birth in NICUs with high rates (>10%) of invasive candidiasis, based on high quality of evidence to support efficacy and safety.46 Additionally, empiric antifungal therapy in preterm infants of \u22641000 g birth weight is associated with improved survival rates without adverse outcomes.47 The staff members of each NICU first must optimize infection control practices and then assess the remaining risk of Candida infections. Finally, environmental fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Fusarium, Scedosporium, Bipolaris, agents of mucormycosis) are important sources of infection for severely immunocompromised patients; meticulous attention to the conditions of the internal environment of any facility that provides care for severely immunocompromised patients is required, as well as prevention of possible exposure to construction dust in and around healthcare facilities.13 With the advent of more effective and less toxic antifungal agents and improved outcomes, it is important to identify promptly the infecting agent by obtaining tissue samples and to determine susceptibility to candidate antifungal agents.",

Standardization of surveillance methodology has become especially important with the advent of state legislation for mandatory reporting of HAI rates to the public. The NHSN now receives, analyzes, and reports data from >17,000 healthcare facilities in the US. A standardized infection ratio (SIR) that takes into account differences in risk among healthcare settings, unit types, procedures, and patient populations has been included in summary reports of HAI rates since 2009.56 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and most states use the NHSN data for public reporting of HAI rates on their websites. Although much effort has been directed toward making these data understandable and useful to consumers, interpretation of these data by the public remains difficult, and more research is needed to optimize methods of data display to the public.57 New York State is the first state to have published an improvement in process and outcomes of central line\u2013associated bloodstream infection rates in NICUs following implementation of a public reporting program.58\n",

Medical centers can use different methods of surveillance, as outlined in Box 2.1\n. Most experts agree that a combination of methods enhances surveillance and reliability of data, and some combination of clinical chart review and database retrieval is important. Whatever data collection systems are used, validation is required. Administrative databases created for the purposes of billing should not be used as the sole source to identify HAIs because of overestimates and underestimates that result from inaccurate coding of HAIs.59 Use of software designed specifically for IPC data entry and analysis facilitates real-time tracking of trends and timely intervention when clusters are identified.

A program of active surveillance cultures and Contact Precautions is best reserved for implementation in a targeted fashion (i.e., in units with an indication of ongoing transmission of MRSA, VRE, or other MDROs) according to 2006 guidelines, if transmission continues after standardized horizontal interventions have been completely implemented.5 At this time, no formal recommendation has been made to discontinue routine use of Contact Precautions for patients with asymptomatic colonization with MRSA or VRE in an endemic setting; thus each IPC program must determine practice based on local conditions and follow with close auditing and surveillance for potential adverse outcomes.",

Hospital administrative support for the infrastructure required for ongoing measurement and reporting of antimicrobial use and other related outcome measures, including feedback to prescribers, is a critical component of a successful antimicrobial stewardship program. An antimicrobial stewardship program can optimize clinical outcomes while decreasing unintended consequences of antimicrobial use, including the emergence of resistant organisms. Additionally, use of specific antimicrobial agents can alert the IPC program to the presence of potentially infectious patients (e.g., with pulmonary tuberculosis, MDROs). National guidelines exist for developing and implementing an institutional antimicrobial stewardship program, including core components for acute care hospitals and for long-term care facilities.68, 70 The Natinal Quality Forum and its partners have also developed a Playbook that provides additional guidance for implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs in acute care. The knowledge and skills required for antimicrobial stewardship leaders also have been defined.50, 71\n",

            "text": "The most recent Guideline for Isolation Precautions published in 20074 reaffirms Standard Precautions, a combination of universal precautions and body substance isolation, as the foundation of transmission prevention measures. Critical thinking is required for HCP to recognize the importance of body fluids, excretions, and secretions in the transmission of infectious pathogens and take appropriate protective precautions by using PPE (e.g., masks, gowns, gloves, face shields, or goggles) and safety devices when exposure is likely even if an infection is not suspected or known. In addition, these updated guidelines provide recommendations for Standard Precautions in all settings in which healthcare is delivered (acute care hospitals, ambulatory surgical and medical centers, long-term care facilities, and home health agencies). The components of Standard Precautions are summarized in Table 2.1\n. In the most recent HICPAC/CDC isolation guideline,4 safe injection practices are included as a component of Standard Precautions. Despite the emphasis on safe injection practices, transmission of hepatitis B and C viruses continues to be reported in ambulatory care settings as a result of failure to follow recommended practices, thus indicating a need to reiterate the established effective practices.77 During 2008 to 2014, 45 outbreaks (\u22652 cases) of viral hepatitis related to healthcare were reported to the CDC; of these, 42 (95%) occurred in nonhospital settings. A review of clusters of transmission of hepatitis C virus in dialysis centers from 2005 to 2015 identified the following potential infection control breaches: (1) use of multidose vials for heparin or saline administration; (2) poor compliance with hand hygiene before and after patient contacts or after touching a possibly contaminated surface; (3) failure to change gloves between patient contacts or after contact with a potentially contaminated surface; (4) failure to disinfect environmental surfaces adequately; (5) unsafe injection practices; (6) failure to disinfect shared equipment between patient uses; (7) lack of a separate area for medication preparation; and (8) failure to have clean and dirty utility rooms clearly separated.78\n",

The 3 categories of Transmission-Based Precautions are Contact Precautions, Droplet Precautions, and Airborne Precautions, and they are based on the likely routes of transmission of specific infectious agents. Transmission-based precautions are combined for infectious agents that have more than 1 route of transmission. When used singly or in combination, such precautions always are used in addition to Standard Precautions. Transmission-based precautions applied at the time of initial contact, based on the clinical presentation and the most likely pathogens are referred to as Empiric Precautions or Syndromic Precautions. This approach is useful especially for emerging agents (e.g., SARS-CoV, avian influenza, pandemic influenza), for which information concerning routes of transmission is evolving. The categories of clinical presentation are as follows: diarrhea, central nervous system, generalized rash or exanthem, respiratory, skin or wound infection. Single-patient rooms always are preferred for children needing Transmission-Based Precautions. If single-patient rooms are unavailable, cohorting of patients, and preferably of staff, according to clinical diagnosis is recommended. The experience of treating EVD in the US in 2014 led to the development of special precautions after viral transmission to 2 nurses occurred as a result of patients' extraordinarily high viral loads and large volumes of emitted body fluids.6 PPE for all transmission-based precautions is donned upon entry into the room to protect against acquisition of pathogens from contaminated surfaces, even if direct contact with the patient is not intended.",

Occupying a room previously occupied by a patient with a key pathogen is a risk factor for acquiring that pathogen during a hospital stay. Most often, the failure to follow recommended procedures for cleaning and disinfection contributes more than does the specific pathogen to the environmental reservoir during outbreaks. Education of environmental services personnel combined with direct observation and feedback was associated with a persistent decrease in VRE acquisition in a medical ICU. Use of a standardized cleaning checklist and implementation of monitoring for adherence to recommended environmental cleaning practices are important determinants of success. Visual markers (e.g., invisible fluorescein powder) and adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence technologies are also useful for monitoring effective environmental cleaning and providing immediate feedback to workers.87 A program of environmental cleaning should be developed collaboratively by the IPC and environmental services departments. Certain infectious agents (e.g., rotavirus, noroviruses, C. difficile) can be resistant to some routinely used hospital disinfectants; thus when ongoing transmission occurs despite appropriate cleaning procedures, a 1 : 10 dilution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) or other special disinfectants are indicated.",

Ultraviolet technology also has been considered as a method of disinfecting PPE, as a risk mitigation strategy for HCP caring for patients with EVD.88 These technologies supplement, but do not replace, standard cleaning and disinfection because surfaces must be physically cleaned of particulate matter and debris.

The Spaulding classification of patient care equipment as critical, semicritical, and noncritical items with regard to sterilization and disinfection is used by the CDC. Critical items require sterilization because they enter sterile body tissues and carry a high risk of causing infection if they are contaminated; semicritical items require disinfection because they may contact mucous membranes and nonintact skin; and noncritical items require routine cleaning because they come in contact only with intact skin. If noncritical items used on patients requiring Transmission-Based Precautions, especially Contact Precautions, must be shared, these items should be disinfected between uses. Guidelines for specific objects and specific disinfectants are published and updated by the CDC. Multiple published reports and manufacturers similarly recommend the use and reuse of objects with appropriate sterilization, disinfection, or cleaning recommendations. Recommendations in guidelines for reprocessing endoscopes to avoid contamination focus on training of personnel, meticulous manual cleaning, high-level disinfection followed by rinsing and air-drying, and proper storage.92 However, outbreaks of MDR GNB infections associated with exposure to duodenoscopes used for retrograde cholangiopancreatography that have been reprocessed according to recommendations suggest a need for new endoscope reprocessing technologies.51, 93 These endoscopes have a complex design with long, narrow channels, crevices that are difficult to access with a cleaning brush, right-angle turns, and heavy microbial contamination following procedures. Until new methods are developed, meticulous adherence to recommended processes with enhancements should be followed. Medical devices that are designed for single use (e.g., specialized catheters, electrodes, biopsy needles) must be reprocessed by third parties or hospitals according to the guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August, 2000 with amendments in September, 2006; such reprocessors are considered and regulated as \u201cmanufacturers.\u201d Available data show that single-use devices reprocessed according to the FDA regulatory requirements are as safe and effective as new devices.",

The following recommendations regarding visitation can guide policy development:1.Sibling visitation is encouraged in the well-child nursery and NICU, as well as in areas for care of older children.2.Before visitation, parents should be interviewed by a trained staff nurse concerning the current health status of the sibling. Siblings should not be allowed to visit if they are delinquent in recommended vaccines, have fever or symptoms of an acute illness, or are within the incubation period following exposure to a known infectious disease. After the interview, the physician or nurse should place a written consent for sibling visitation in the patient's permanent record and a name tag indicating that the sibling has been approved for visitation for that day.3.Asymptomatic siblings who recently were exposed to varicella but who previously were immunized can be assumed to be immune.4.The visiting sibling should visit only his or her sibling and not be allowed in playrooms with groups of patients.5.Visitation should be limited to periods of time that ensure adequate screening, observation, and monitoring of visitors by medical and nursing staff members.6.Children should perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the patient or upon entry and departure from the patient's room.7.During the entire visit, sibling activity should be supervised by parents or another responsible adult.\n",

The association of community-associated MRSA in HCP working in an outpatient HIV clinic with environmental community-associated MRSA contamination of that clinic indicates the potential for transmission in this setting.112 Patient-to-patient transmission of Burkholderia species and P. aeruginosa in outpatient clinics for patients with cystic fibrosis has been confirmed and prevented by implementing recommended IPC methods.9 IPC guidelines and policies for pediatric outpatient settings, including office practices, were published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2007,113 reaffirmed in 2015, and are updated currently. Prevention strategies include definition of policies, education, and strict adherence to guidelines. In pediatrics, among the most important interventions are separation of children with respiratory tract illnesses from well children and consistent implementation of respiratory etiquette or cough hygiene. A guideline for IPC for outpatient settings with a checklist and a guideline for outpatient oncology settings can be found on the CDC website.114 Principles and recommendations for Safe Living after HSCT115 and for patients with cystic fibrosis9 are valuable contributions to management of infectious risks for specific populations in the ambulatory setting. A guideline based on data and expert consensus opinion for IPC in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families provides practical guidance for settings where high-risk patients live with their families for varying periods of time.116 IPC challenges now are being addressed in long-term care facilities for children.117 More data are needed to determine the most effective and least restrictive practices.",
