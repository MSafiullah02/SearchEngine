PCR and sequencing on those subcultures confirmed macrolide resistance in 6 specimens that had been previously identified by direct real-time PCR and in 2 additional specimens that had not previously been detected by PCR. The 2 specimens most likely tested negative for mutations by direct PCR because of a low number of organisms in the original sample.

            "text": "MRMP prevalence has been reported to range from 2% to 26% in European countries (7, 8) and is 30% in Israel (9). The prevalence is much higher in Asia, where MRMP first emerged in 2000, and now exceeds 90% in some areas of China and Japan (10, 11) . Macrolide resistance has been documented in North America since 2008 (6, 12) . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently published results from 199 specimens obtained from case-patients, small clusters, and outbreaks that occurred during 2006-2013 but did not specify geographic locations from which specimens were derived. An overall 10% rate of macrolide resistance was reported (13) . Our finding of high-level macrolide resistance in 13.2% of specimens from all 6 centers throughout a broad geographic area in the United States proves this problem has emerged in all regions of the nation and might increase over time, as it has in other countries. The design of our epidemiologic study provides the most accurate estimate of the point prevalence of MRMP available thus far. Previous studies reported from the United States were limited primarily to individual case reports, clusters, outbreaks, or single geographic locations.",

Thus, we were able to correlate erythromycin MICs with the presence of 23S rRNA mutations. Our results showed striking differences in erythromycin MICs between the susceptible and resistant isolates and confirmed high-level resistance to erythromycin in every isolate. Erythromycin is usually used for testing because mutations in A2063 and A2064 consistently have been shown to cause high resistance to both erythromycin and azithromycin (3, 5, 10) . A limitation of the study is the nature of anonymous specimen collection. Inclusion of patient information, especially antimicrobial therapy, will enhance data interpretation in prospectively conducted future studies.",

Clinicians should be vigilant for macrolide treatment failures and consider using alternative drugs if necessary. Countries such as Japan and China that have a very high macrolide resistance rate for M. pneumoniae and other respiratory pathogens often have high consumption of macrolides. Okada et al. (5) reported that macrolides account for 30% of all oral antibacterial drugs in Japan and concluded that the increase in macrolide-resistant bacteria during the past several years in that country was closely related to selective pressure resulting from widespread antimicrobial use. Given the common use of macrolides in the United States to treat pediatric respiratory infections, judicious use of antimicrobial drugs should be emphasized. Reevaluation of existing classes and investigation of new classes of antimicrobial agents may be prudent to have additional treatment alternatives for MRMP infections beyond tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. Surveillance for this resistance in the United States will help monitor the trend. ",
