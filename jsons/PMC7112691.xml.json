Infected cells activate innate and adaptive immune responses, and host antiviral defense is switched on to eliminate invading viruses. Viruses may persist in infected cells when antiviral defenses are insufficient. The series of interactive processes cause the differential expression of cellular genes, and it has been of interest to understand how altered gene expression plays a role during virus infection. RT-PCR, RNase protection assays, and Northern and Western blot analyses are commonly used techniques to identify altered gene expression. RT-PCR in particular, has been used to study porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-mediated altered gene expression for IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 (Johnsen et al., 2002, Feng et al., 2003, Suradhat and Thanawongnuwech, 2003, Thanawongnuwech and Thacker, 2003). Such techniques, however, are often time-consuming and labor-intensive and lead to high degrees of experimental variation. For such reasons, little is known concerning the molecular changes in cells upon PRRSV infection.",

Instead, a triple membrane spanning region is found in the middle of the protein between residues 65 and 130, leaving a large stretch of a 70 amino acid cytoplasmic tail at the C-terminus (Mardassi et al., 1995, Meulenberg et al., 1995). GP5 exists as a heterodimer with the M protein in the virion (Mardassi et al., 1996), and heterodimerization has been shown to be essential for virus infectivity in LDV (Faaberg et al., 1995) and EAV (Snijder et al., 2003).

The electrophoretic migration of the mature protein incorporated into virions is 31\u201335 kDa, suggesting that the GP4 protein is heavily glycosylated during transport through the ER\u2013Golgi complex (van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996). Four potential N-glycosylation sites are found on the protein. The amino acid sequence shows that GP4 contains a putative N-terminal signal sequence at positions 1\u201322, and an additional hydrophobic sequence at positions 162\u2013178 at the C-terminus. The hydrophobicity profile of GP4 suggests that it resembles a class I integral membrane protein. However, GP4 has a unique feature uncommonly seen in this class of proteins\u2014the lack of a hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail on the carboxy terminus of the hydrophobic transmembrane region. This unique topology of GP4 is found to mimic a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein (Ferguson and Williams, 1988). Indeed, GP4 has been shown to be a GPI-anchored protein in our laboratory (Bachand, 2003). The function of GPI anchors is poorly understood, but limited evidence suggests that they are involved in \u2018lipid rafts\u2019 (Varma and Mayor, 1998) or in cellular signal transduction (Jacobs et al., 2000).",

The genes were arrayed in duplicate on one slide. Detailed information on the layout of the microarray is found at the Microarray Centre (http://www.microarrays.ca/support/glists.html). At 48 h post-induction, total cellular RNAs were extracted from each line of established cells, Marc-GP4 and HeLa-GP5, and from their corresponding parental cells, Marc-145 and HeLa-Tet-off, respectively. Complementary DNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription using 500 units of SuperScript II (Invitrogen) in a total reaction volume of 50 \u03bcl. Briefly, 10 \u03bcg of total RNA was primed with the AncT primer (Sigma Genosys; 5\u2032T(20)-V-N 3\u2032) and reverse transcription was carried out in the presence of 0.5 mM each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP (Invitrogen), 0.15 mM dTTP, amino-allyl 0.15 mM dUTP, 10 mM DTT in 10\u00d7 first-strand synthesis buffer (Invitrogen; 250 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.3], 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2).

The reaction was stopped by heating to 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, and the RNA template was degraded by the addition 10 \u03bcl of 1N NaOH followed by incubation at 65 \u00b0C for 5 min. The mixture was neutralized by the addition 10 \u03bcl of 1 M HCl and 5 \u03bcl of 1 M Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5). The cDNA was purified using Microcon columns (Millipore) and labeled with Alexa dyes (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 1 h in darkness.

For GP5 expression, we used the tetracycline-dependent inducible gene expression system (Tet-on/Tet-off) to avoid a possible cell death that may result from GP5 expression since the PRRSV GP5 protein was reported to induce cytotoxicity in African green monkey kidney cells (Su\u00e1rez et al., 1996).

The presence of tetracycline (Tet) or its derivative doxycycline (Dox) in the culture medium prevents binding of tTA to the promoter, while the removal of Tet or Dox induces gene transcription placed under control of the promoter. Marc-145 and HeLa-Tet-off cells were transfected with pCI-Neo-ORF4 and pTRE-ORF5-hyg, respectively, and to confer resistance of transformed cells, neomycin (G418) or hygromycin were added. Transfected HeLa-Tet-off cells were maintained in the presence of doxycycline to prevent the GP5 expression during selection.

We established cell lines stably expressing the GP4 or GP5 protein, both protein genes under the control of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) immediate early promoter, and experiments were designed to assess patterns of gene regulation in these cells. In GP5-expressing HeLa cells, actin-related protein 1 (ARP1) homologs A and B were identified to be up-regulated. These genes encode a subunit of dynactin that binds to both microtubules and cytoplasmic dynein, and is involved in ER-to-Golgi transport (Lees-Miller et al., 1992). This may implicate an important function of GP5 in the transport of the viral components. The bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) gene was down-regulated by GP5 by more than six-folds. BPGM is an erythrocyte specific trifunctional enzyme regulating the level of 2,3-BPG in red blood cells. 2,3-BPG is the main allosteric effector of hemoglobin, shifting the equilibrium between the oxy and deoxy conformation of hemoglobins by stabilizing the unliganded form. Sickle cell anemia in humans is characterized by polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin mutants giving rise to deformed erythrocytes and vasoocclusive complications. 2,3-BPG has been shown to facilitate this polymerization in sickle cell anemia. In humans, deficiency of BPGM has been shown to be associated with anemia (Jacobasch and Rapoport, 1996). RASSF2 was also down-regulated by GP5. RASSF2 is a new member of the RASSF1 family and shares the properties of Ras effector/tumor suppressors (Vos et al., 2003). Similarly, cyclin D3 gene expression was found to be suppressed. D-type cyclins are the key regulators along with cyclin E for cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Complexes formed between cyclin D or cyclin E and their kinase partners are involved in phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, which ultimately leads to activation of E2F transcription factor and progression to S phase of the cell cycle. A recent study demonstrates a clear reduction of cyclin D3 and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase in cells infected with mouse hepatitis coronavirus, a member of nidoviruses (Chen and Makino, 2004).",

This observation implicates that the GP4 protein may utilize or change host cell machinery to transport viral or cellular components to the cell surface. Zinc finger protein 36 (zfp36) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein were readily up-regulated, while metallothineins, proliferating cell nuclear protein, and N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase were down-regulated. Zinc finger protein 36-like 1 is a member of the tristetraprolin family of tandem CCCH finger proteins. Tristetraprolin can bind to AU-rich elements within the 3\u2032-untranslated regions of the mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), leading to accelerated mRNA degradation (Stumpo et al., 2004). Tristetraprolin-knockout mice exhibit an inflammatory phenotype that is largely due to increased TNF secretion (Taylor et al., 1996). Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein is a protein complex required for the assembly of lipoprotein particles (Gordon et al., 1995). It is noteworthy that GP4 has recently been shown to be a lipid-anchored protein (Bachand, 2003). Metallothionein is a metal binding protein and has been shown to be regulated by a common virus infection (Ilback et al., 2004). Coxsackievirus B-type 3 virus infection altered the normal physiological trace element balance in the liver, kidney, spleen, and increased metallothionein in these organs. This may be a normal response in common infections that could adversely influence the pathogenesis when the host is concomitantly exposed to potentially toxic trace elements, even at levels in the physiological range. The function of N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase is unclear.",

This observation is contradictory to the previous report (Su\u00e1rez et al., 1996) but is consistent with our recent finding that the GP5 expressing cells did not show any detectable level of cytotoxicity or cell death (Lee et al., 2004). Zhang et al. (1999) have shown that PRRSV infection induced the expression of IFN-inducible gene Mx1 and an ubiquitin-specific protease in porcine alveolar macrophages. These genes were not identifiable in the present study. This difference may be due to the use of different cell types since Marc-145 or HeLa cells were used in the present study to express the single GP4 or GP5 protein rather than using the whole virus to infect porcine macrophages in the previous report.",

Confirmatory studies are further required as to the significance of the genes that have been identified in the present study. The method of choice to measure and confirm the differential mRNA expression mediated by the GP4 and GP5 proteins is real-time quantitative RT-PCR. It is also possible that altered mRNA profiles may not necessarily reflect altered production of corresponding proteins (Gygi et al., 1999). In this regard, additional techniques such as Western blot analysis or protein arrays may be needed to support our findings. Nevertheless, our data obtained from the microarray study will provide future insights into the understanding of host cell virus interactions and eventually of the pathogenic mechanisms of PRRSV and the host responses to PRRSV infection.",
