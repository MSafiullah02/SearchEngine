            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a significant cause of human morbidity and mortality throughout Asia and Africa. Vaccines have reduced the incidence of JE in some countries, but no specific antiviral therapy is currently available. The NS3 protein of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a multifunctional protein combining protease, helicase and nucleoside 5 0 -triphosphatase (NTPase) activities. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of this protein has recently been solved using a roentgenographic method. This enabled structure-based virtual screening for novel inhibitors of JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase. The aim of the present research was to identify novel potent medicinal substances for the treatment of JE. In the first step of studies, the natural ligand ATP and two known JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase inhibitors were docked to their molecular target. The refined structure of the enzyme was used to construct a pharmacophore model for JEV NS3 helicase/ NTPase inhibitors. The freely available ZINC database of lead-like compounds was then screened for novel inhibitors. About 1 161 000 compounds have been screened and 15 derivatives of the highest scores have been selected. These compounds were docked to the JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase to examine their binding mode and verify screening results by consensus scoring procedure.",

            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the primary cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30 000-50 000 cases reported annually, mainly in children (Diagana et al., 2007) . Acute encephalitis develops in about 1-20 cases per 1000 infections, leading to death in 25% of cases and producing serious neurological lesions in 30% (Diagana et al., 2007; Jackson et al., 2007) . Infections with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are most often asymptomatic. Only one in 300 cases produce clinical features (Solomon, 1997) . The first signs of infection appear after an incubation period of between 6 and 14 days (Diagana et al., 2007) . The disease usually begins with a high fever, chills, muscle pain and meningitis-type headaches accompanied by vomiting. The initial clinical features in children usually involve gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pains). These nonspecific symptoms can continue for 2-4 days. After this period, the patient's condition deteriorates rapidly. Eighty-five percent of subjects suffer from convulsions (Kumar et al., 1990) . The meningeal syndrome pre-dominates, causing painful neck stiffness. Additionally, motor paralyses including hemiplegia and tetraplegia may also occur. In about 30% of patients, tremor, rigidity, abnormal movements and other signs of extrapyramidal involvement are present (Kumar et al., 1994) . Recovery usually leaves serious behavioral and neurological sequelae such as persistently altered sensorium, extrapyramidal syndrome, epileptic seizures and severe mental retardation in children (Diagana et al., 2007) .",

JEV helicase, composed of three domains, displays an asymmetric distribution of charges on its surface, and contains a tunnel large enough to accommodate single-stranded RNA. Each of the motifs I (Walker A motif), II (Walker B motif) and VI contribute to the NTPbinding pocket. From mutation analysis (Yamashita et al., 2008) , it was possible to conclude that all of the residues in the Walker A motif (Gly199, Lys200 and Thr201), in addition to the polar residues within the NTP-binding pocket (Gln457, Arg461 and Arg464), and also Arg458 in the outside of the pocket in the motif IV, were significant for NTPase and helicase activities and virus replication. In particular, Lys200 was crucial and could not be exchanged for other amino acid residues without sacrificing activity.",

All the crucial residues identified in mutagenesis studies (Yamashita et al., 2008) , i.e. Gly199, Lys200, Thr201, Glu286, Gln457, Arg458, Arg461 and Arg464, were identified as the binding site residues.

Next, the Screen Library module of DISCOVERY STUDIO 2.1 was applied to screen the ZINC database of about 1 161 000 lead-like compounds. Fifteen hits (8-22) have been selected and docked with Surflex to the JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase-binding site. The final ranking list was established by the simple consensus scoring procedure. The sum of the total value obtained in the docking with Surflex and the fit value obtained in the Screen Library procedure with DISCOVERY STUDIO 2.1 multiplied by 2 (to obtain equally significant contributions) was used as the final score. For the identified hits, ability to cross blood-brain barrier and lipophilicity (with the Suzuki-Kudo atomic contribution method) were calculated using Preadmet server (pread met.bmdrc.org).",

During the docking procedure, a significant problem was the bioactive conformation of ATP. In over 70% of binding poses the obtained ATP conformation was not linear. The value of the dihedral angle determined by C5 0 atom of ribose, the neighboring oxygen atom, a phosphorus atom and the bridging oxygen atom varied from \u00c0 162.251 to 53.631 for the most bent conformers. The dihedral angle determined by C5 0 -connected ribose oxygen atom, a phosphorus atom, the brid-ging oxygen and the b phosphorus atom varied from 162.631 to 93.871 for the most bent conformers. It was observed that the lowest energy conformers were characterized by the least linear conformation of ATP. The energy difference between the geometrically extreme structures was 54.25 kcal mol \u00c01 , due to the presence of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the ATP molecule. During the molecular dynamics simulation of ATP-enzyme complexes the ATP conformation became more bent. However, the lowest energy conformers did not result in the binding pose, which would be in accordance with the mutagenesis data (Yamashita et al., 2008) , and therefore the compromise conformer was accepted as the final one.",

The other keto group of the inhibitor is engaged in the network of hydrogen bond with Arg464 and, through the water molecules, with the main chain NH hydrogen atoms of Gly197 and Ser198. Arg464 also interacts with the imidazole ring nitrogen atom through another water molecule. The imidazole moiety interacts through the next water molecule with Glu286. The amino group of 1 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn417. The obtained binding pose of 1 explains its inhibitory activity toward JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase. It interacts with two residues in the JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase binding pocket, which are crucial for ATP binding, namely with Glu286 and Arg464. Glu286 is a conserved glutamic acid residue that probably acts as a catalytic base and accepts a proton from the attacking water molecule during ATP hydrolysis (Frick & Lam, 2006) .

The first class may be treated as close analogs of nucleosides and nucleotides. As these inhibitors are similar to the natural NS3 helicase/NTPase ligand, ATP, they are very likely to compete with ATP for the same binding site. Benzimidazoles and benzotriazoles as well as some naturally occurring compounds such as antibiotic nogalamycin 4 are modulators that interact with the allosteric binding site (Borowski et al., 2002 (Borowski et al., , 2003 . The mechanism of their modulating effect remains unclear.

The approximate configuration of ATP in the binding site can be seen by comparing a JEV helicase structure with one of a similar helicases crystallized in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. For example, in the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase catalytic core in the complex with the ATP analog ATPgS (PDB code 1OYY) the adenine moiety is packed between Tyr23 and Arg27 side chains and hydrogen bonds are formed between the N6 and N7 atoms of the adenine and Gln30 of RecQ motif 0 (Bernstein et al., 2003) . The ATPgS triphosphate is bound to RecQDC by Lys53 and several backbone amides in motif I, and through an Mn 21 ion, which makes watermediated contact with Ser54 of motif I and Asp146 of motif II. The obtained binding mode of ATP to JEV NS3 helicase/ NTPase corresponds to the position of ATPgS RecQ helicase catalytic core described above. Moreover, it should be stressed that the conformation of ATPgS is slightly bent, similar to the final conformation of ATP. The conformation and binding mode of ATP in the binding pocket of JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase are also consistent with the recently obtained crystal structure of dengue virus 4 NS3 helicase in complex of ADP, PDB file 2JLS (Luo et al., 2008) . In this crystal structure, the role of conserved lysine (Lys199) and two conserved arginines (Arg460 and Arg463) are clearly visible.",

In particular, the role of Glu286 and Arg464 was clearly depicted. Moreover, docking of 1-2 allowed the identification of Arg202 as an additional important residue of the binding pocket, making this arginine a straightforward candidate for mutational studies. The analysis of ATP-enzyme complex allowed speculation about the role of conserved threonine Thr201. Most probably, it directs the ligand properly toward interactions with Lys200 and the conserved arginine residues. A similar role may be assigned to the branched side chains of apolar amino acids (especially Val227 and Ile411), which was demonstrated in the case of 2 and was suggested earlier for ionotropic glutamate receptors (Kaczor et al., 2008) . Docking of 1-2 indicated Asn417 as an additional anchoring point, whereas docking of identified hits 8-22 also indicated Glu231 as a potentially important residue for interactions with inhibitors. Virtual screening procedure made it possible to identify 15 potential inhibitors of JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase. Only one of them, namely the one containing pentose moiety 14, may be treated as a far analog of nucleosides. This structural diversity may prove beneficial because it increases the likelihood that the new inhibitors will be selective toward human ATPases. This is a significant problem: it is worth emphasizing that ring-expanded nucleosides 1 and 2 also have high affinity to human Suv3 mitochondrial helicase (routinely used to test the selectivity of novel inhibitors of viral helicase/NTPase), which excludes them as drug candidates (Zhang et al., 2003) .",

This seems promising, as the research on specific anti-JEV compounds may lead to the development of a drug with broad antiviral spectrum of activity. Indeed, structural analysis of the helicases of dengue virus (DEN), yellow fever virus (YFV) and HCV revealed that these viral helicases have very similar structures composed of three functional domains (Yao et al., 1997; Wu et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005; Yamashita et al., 2008) . The amino acid sequences of the NS3 helicase domain of JEV exhibited 65%, 44% and 23% homology to those of DEN, YFV and HCV, respectively (Yamashita et al., 2008) . The crystal structures of the NS3 helicases of DEN (Xu et al., 2005) and YFV (Wu et al., 2005) are similar to that of JEV, but slightly different from HCV (Yao et al., 1997) . Yamashita et al. (2008) emphasized that the distance between domains 1 and 2 of HCV helicase is longer than that in most flavivirus NS3 helicases. This leads to the conclusion that the HCV helicase has a larger ATP-binding pocket than other flaviviruses, and that the folding of domain 3 of the HCV helicase is unique, whereas the folding of JEV is very similar to those of other flaviviruses, including DEN and YFV (Yamashita et al., 2008) . Superposition of JEV, DEN, YFV and HCV helicases further clarified that the HCV helicase has a unique conformation in the NTPase-binding region and domain 3 in comparison with JEV, DEN and YFV helicases (Yamashita et al., 2008) . In particular, the conformation of motifs I and II of HCV helicase was different from that of JEV, DEN and YFV helicases. The distance between motifs I and II of Ca of HCV and the other flaviviruses was 6.7 and 3.5 \u00c5 , respectively (Yamashita et al., 2008) . There was also a 4.7 \u00c5 difference in the distance of Nz of Lys200 in the motif I between JEV and HCV, suggesting that HCV helicase has a wider ATP-binding pocket than other flaviviruses (Yamashita et al., 2008) . In contrast to the structure of motifs I and II, that of motif VI was well conserved among the flavivirus helicases, including HCV. Although a subtle difference is observed, the ATP-binding residues in JEV, DEN, YFV, and HCV helicases are well conserved, suggesting that flavivirus helicases possess similar mechanisms of ATP hydrolysis, which reflects the lack of specificity of compounds 1 and 2.",

It was reported that consensus scoring usually substantially enhances virtual screening performance, contributing to better enrichments. It also seems to improve, although to a lesser extent, prediction of bound conformations and poses. In particular, the consensus scoring procedure improves prediction of binding energies, which is the greatest problem in virtual screening. Although the obtained binding energy predictions are still inaccurate and further development is required before they can be used for this purpose in routine lead optimization, the consensus scoring procedure is at present the only alternative for improvement of the in silico screening procedure. Wang & Wang (2001) distinguished three main ranking methods of consensus scoring for virtual screening: rankby-number (all the candidates are ranked according to the average predicted values given by all the scoring functions), rank-by-rank (all the candidates are ranked by the average ranks predicted by all the involved scoring functions) and rank-by-vote (if a candidate is predicted to be on the top, for example 2%, by a certain scoring function, then it gets a 'vote' from that scoring function; the final score of a candidate compound is the number of votes gathered from all the scoring functions, which may range from 0 to the total number of scoring functions). The approach we applied may be treated as a modification of rank-by-number method, as we used a sum of total score by Surflex and a doubled value of fit obtained with the Screen Library module of DISCOVERY STUDIO 2.1.",
