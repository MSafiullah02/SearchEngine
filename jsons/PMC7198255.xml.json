This process involves checking whether the landlord is eligible for renting out their property, and negotiation on the details of the contract.

We refer to these spots as parking stalls. This partition can be represented by road marking. Moreover, there has to be a tracking device which will make the parking lot fully observable. A particular example can be a camera with an IoT-powered box, produced by Park Smart [2] as described in their patent [26]. This device has to run image processing algorithms in spot in order to tell at each moment which parking stalls are occupied (a particular implementation is provided in [5]) and what the plate numbers of the parked cars are. A visualisation of these assumptions can be found in Fig. 2.",

It assumes a set of roles to be present is the city. One of them is a city hall, that will be responsible for the deployment of the system as well as setting several policies following the local legislation. Another role is a landlord who possesses a piece of land. A landlord can be a juridical person or a natural person, it does not matter for the system as long as their land satisfies the constraints describer in the Assumptions section. Such situations are common: a landlord does not want to maintain the land fully themselves and rents its parts out, in this case the proposed system allows a landlord to partition their land as they desire and set complex paying policies, that will ensure the agreed-upon conditions at the time of payment for parking. The last role is a driver interested in parking their car. They can observe free spots available at every parking lot and the pricing policy and choose the most suitable one. Payment is also covered conducted through the system, using a micro-payment channel, that makes it possible to enforce and guarantee the distribution of money among the landlords, the city hall and the tenants.",

            "text": "Other works propose architectures that utilise the blockchain solutions as their backbone. All centralised solutions share a common set of problems that make them undesirable for practical use. The most important of such issues is trustworthiness. All participants of such systems have to rely on a particular entity, that will possess the power of accessing, chaining and removing their data, with no guarantee at the time of signing an agreement or registering that the owner of the system will obey to the promised rules. Lack of transparency is another significant shortcoming. When the implementation is not exposed to the end-users, they cannot validate that a particular solution is guaranteed to function in accordance with their needs and that it does not have any back- doors. Finally, considering the ongoing competition on any market, including parking, a centralised solution can be unfair to some participants if the owner is biased towards some companies. In [6] a system is proposed for incorporating blockchain into regular parking scenarios. This paper presents a layered architecture that standardizes the typical architecture of an integrated smart parking system. It also describes the major components of the system as well as provides an overview of possible work-flows of the solution. In this system, there are three major participants: parking service provider, blockchain network, and user. The network enjoys the standard blockchain characteristics: a consensus algorithm, a shared public ledger, running a local copy of the ledger at each parking area. The overview schema of the system can be seen in Fig. 3. The architecture in the described solution consists of four layers: application layer, network layer, transaction layer, and physical layer. This layout of technologies can be considered the current state of the art and is adapted in the solution, proposed in this thesis work. Finally, the authors of the paper describe two main workflows supported by their system: 1. Search and Request of a parking spot and 2. Parking Provider Operations in the system. Even though the paper describes a useful basic concept, it supports a minimal number of scenarios, and thus, one cannot consider it as realistic.",

In addition to that, they tackle the problem of leasing lands to the so-called contractors by distributing non-fungible tokens among them for a particular period. These tokens are issued to the certified landlords by the government.

The main novelty of this system is the use of one-time pad mechanism and a group-signature mechanism together with a union of privileged nodes in order to conceal the details of each transaction and thus preserve users\u2019 privacy while the privileged nodes can still access users\u2019 data. One-time padding means that instead of receiving a real address for each transaction, users, instead, receive a newly generated address each time. This way, the users\u2019 addresses are not exposed. A group signature mechanism allows signing a transaction on behalf of a group, which hides the mapping between transactions and users. Other concepts implemented in this system are relatively similar to the works mentioned above, so the privacy mechanisms are the main beneficial feature of the paper.",

It encourages users to take part in the reporting process, by using the data history in order to calculate which places are more likely to be empty and by providing a framework that does not assume or require any particular installation of infrastructure. In this system, the concept of mobile crowdsensing plays a pivotal role. In order to ensure the involvement of drivers, the system assigns individual points to each driver for their collaboration. Examples of such collaborations are the installation of a special beacon or reporting on the number of free parking spaces in the street. Pedestrians can also participate by reporting through a mobile app. These points can be exchanged for free parking minutes. The authors claim their approach to bring a variety of benefits including a faster search for parking (leading to lower CO2 emissions), easy deployment of the solution as it does not require much an existing infrastructure. Although their reasoning is valid, there is almost no information in the paper how the blockchain technology was incorporated.",

Only two transactions are required: to deploy the contract (by the car) and to claim the end of the payment period (by the parking lot).

Interviews have been conducted with domain experts, user stories defined and a system architecture has been proposed with a case study. Our solution allows independent owners of parking space to be integrated into one unified system, that facilitates the parking situation in a smart city. The utilization of such a system raises the issues of trust and transparency among several actors of the parking process. In order to tackle those, we propose a smart contract-based solution, that brings in trust by encapsulating sensitive relations and processes into transparent and distributed smart contracts. From the architecture point of view services and, in particular, microservices [7, 9, 22] and their composition, orchestration [20, 23], reconfiguration [21] and recovery [10] have not been discussed. All these are open issues that need to be investigated in future.",
