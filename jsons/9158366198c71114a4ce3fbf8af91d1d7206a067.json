            "text": "Vincenzo Berghella, MD T he number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States is on a quicker upward trajectory than any country in the world, and it will even exceed Italy. 1 Given the alarming increase in both infections and deaths from exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the United States will soon become the most affected country in the world. In addition, since pregnant women are at a high risk of developing pneumonia from viruses, such as the influenza virus, the risk of pregnant women contracting COVID-19 disease is even higher. The limited early data show that pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19einduced pneumonia may be at a higher risk of being intubated and becoming critically ill (approximately 8%); experiencing complications such as miscarriage, preterm birth (41%), preeclampsia (14%), cesarean delivery (91%), and stillbirth (2.4%); being admitted to the intensive care unit (8%); and neonatal death (2.4%). 2 Although no maternal deaths have been reported in the world so far (March 21, 2020), the first ones are happening even today. Pregnancy should be considered a comorbidity, and pregnant women at risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19 disease.",

Healthcare workers need utmost protection now. The availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers, such as surgical masks, N-95 masks, or equivalent masks, should be prioritized and provided by the federal government and individual states. At Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, it is now mandatory that all obstetrical healthcare workers coming in direct contact with patients wear PPE, in both the outpatient and the inpatient (eg, L&D) settings. Although other specialties can drastically decrease provider-patient in-person outpatient and even inpatient (eg, elective surgeries) interactions, the obstetrics group is a specialty (with surgical oncology being another exception) that cannot avoid these direct interpersonal interactions, as childbirth requires direct contact and cannot be postponed.",
