Odontogenic infections are characteristically caused by bacteria resident in the dental plaque. These bacteria are not primarily pathogenic, but may initiate and sustain infectious processes if present in high levels or at the wrong location (tissue invasion). Dental caries is caused by acid\u2010producing gram\u2010positive facultative bacteria, and infections of the tooth\u2010supporting tissues (marginal and apical periodontitis) are characterized by gram\u2010negative proteolytic and predominantly anaerobic species. Although a number of bacterial species have been specifically associated with odontogenic infections, the microbial nature of odontogenic infections is polymicrobial and may show relatively little microbial specificity.",

Typically, specific microorganisms will appear in some types of oral infections, but seldom in others. Table 1 presents the most common infectious agents in non\u2010odontogenic infections and the most common illnesses caused by these agents. Thus, Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen in skin infections, abscesses and sometimes in the oral mucosa (angular and lip cheilitis). The organism is seldom recovered from upper and lower respiratory infectious diseases, such as tonsillitis and otitis media. Streptococcus pyogenes is a common pathogen of skin infections and a major pathogen in tonsillitis, but is less common in infections of the oral mucosa and the rest of the respiratory system. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are pathogens of the respiratory system, including sinusitis and otitis media. However, the organisms are virtually never involved in infections of the oral cavity. Helicobacter pylori is the key organism in stomach infections and may be present in the oral cavity, but it is not considered to cause infections in any part of the respiratory system. Enterococci and aerobic gram\u2010negative bacilli, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are potential pathogens in every part of the respiratory system, especially in immunocompromised individuals, but the organisms are seldom seen on the skin. Legionella pneumoniae is associated only with pneumonia.",

Candida spp. cause clinical infections in the oral cavity and in the respiratory tract, Aspergillus spp. cause clinical infections in the lower respiratory system, and Malassezia spp. and Trichophyton spp. cause clinical infections exclusively on the skin. Viral infections may manifest and produce symptoms on the skin over most of the body, including the face and the oral mucosa. Examples of such viruses are measles, chickenpox and hand, foot and mouth disease. Some viruses may result in localized oral infections and ulcers, such as the herpes simplex virus\u20101 (herpes labialis) and the varicella\u2013zoster virus (facial skin, lips, and oral mucosa). Other viruses target the oropharynx (Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u2010related mononucleosis), the upper respiratory tract (the common cold virus and the influenza virus), or the lower part of the respiratory system [the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)]. Finally, parasitic infections may also occur in the oral environment. Leishmaniasis is a serious disease that can affect the oropharynx and the facial skin.",

            "text": "Distinction must be made among bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infections in the oral cavity in order to provide a precise diagnosis and to give optimal care. The diagnosis, which forms the basis for appropriate therapy, is made by the clinical appearance and symptoms of the infection and by microbiological sampling and analysis of the offending infectious agents. White mucosal lesions are often caused by yeasts, and oral ulcers often have a viral component; however, the clinical picture of a variety of oral infections is far from clear. Microbiological diagnosis of oral lesions is underemphasized in dentistry and most dentists do not use microbiological sampling in their daily practice (4). This is the result of a lack of knowledge of microbiology and because of perceived difficulties in interpreting the microbiological diagnosis and making the relevant treatment decision. Proficient oral microbiology laboratories are also absent in many countries. Even if an oral microbiology service facility actually exists, many dentists are unaware of its existence (15). Many dentists using a medical microbiology laboratory have the experience of getting the answer \u2018normal oral flora\u2019, which does not provide much useful information. Moreover, a major reason for rejection of microbiological sampling in endodontics is that dentists do not think that it offers any advantage compared with conventional treatment strategies (12). This argument for not using microbiological diagnostics can probably also be applied to other oral infections. Lack of laboratory request forms and sampling material are also barriers for using a microbiology testing service. Increased and better communication between the dentist and the oral microbiology laboratory is a prerequisite for a more successful use of microbiological diagnostic services in the treatment of oral infections.",

Dahl\u00e9n (5) has discussed whether the presence of microorganisms in an oral mucosal sample is of etiological relevance or if the bacteria only represent a carrier state, colonizing oral surfaces with little or no relation to the etiology of the diseases. Oral mucosal infections often occur during breakdown of the microbial homeostasis (balance), which allows opportunistic microorganisms to overgrow and subsequently cause disease. Common bacterial opportunists in the mouth are S. aureus, enterococci, beta\u2010hemolytic streptococci and aerobic gram\u2010negative bacilli (E. coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., and others).

Although Candida albicans is still the most frequent pathogen recovered, later studies have shown that other Candida spp., including C. tropicalis, C. krusei and the recently described C. dublinensis, are also present in oral candidiasis.

            "text": "Viral infections have been largely overlooked in both the dental literature and dental practice, unless, like HIV and hepatitis B and C, they have had implications on the practice of barrier\u2010preventive techniques and risk of disease transfer. During the past decade, the interest for mammalian viruses in oral diseases has increased considerably. This is a result of the finding that viruses may play a significant role in the oral ecosystem and in disease development, such as periodontitis (18). Slots (18) has described how periodontal sites containing Epstein\u2013Barr virus or cytomegalovirus show more extensive tissue breakdown than herpesvirus\u2010negative sites. However, the association between herpesviruses and destructive periodontal disease is probably not exclusively because of the virus infection. Herpesvirus\u2010related periodontitis may result from an ecological synergy between viruses and bacteria, where an active herpesvirus infection induces a local immunosuppression, which then leads to an overgrowth of periodontopathic bacteria. Another synergistic interaction between viruses and bacteria takes place with herpetic gingivostomatitis, which occurs in children as a primary infection or as a re\u2010activation of herpes simplex virus\u20101 and a secondary bacterial infection. It is plausible that herpesviruses, including Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, play a similar role in the development of acute necrotizing gingivitis and noma. A similar form of acute gingivostomatitis occurs in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), in whom secondary bacterial or fungal infections are clearly the consequence of a virus\u2010induced immunosuppression. Oral ulcers have several etiologies, including treatment with cytotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, intake of etching foods and autoimmune reactions, but viruses, most prominently herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus, are probably the most common causes of oral ulcers. Secondary invasion of bacteria in oral ulcers may subsequently worsen the lesions clinically and postpone healing. Also, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, herpesvirus\u20108 (Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma virus) and papillomaviruses are important oncogenic agents in the oral cavity (19). As viral infections manifest quite differently in children and adults, the topic of oral viral infections is discussed in two separate chapters of this issue of Periodontology 2000 (17, 19).",

Each of these infections has been described in separate chapters of this volume of Periodontology 2000. These infections are important medical infections that are extremely common and are heavily resource\u2010requiring in daily medical practice. Certain microorganisms are major pathogens in specific infections, for example S. pyogenes (group A streptococci) in pharyngotonsillitis (20), and S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in sinusitis (2, 3), whereas other infections, such as abscesses, are more nonspecific and polymicrobial in nature. Anaerobic bacteria, primarily from the oro\u2010pharyngeal resident flora, predominate in all types (odontogenic as well as non\u2010odontogenic) of deep infections (abscesses) in the head and neck region. Anaerobes are probably underestimated in sinusitis and tonsillitis, especially if the infections are purulent and abscess\u2010forming.",

An abundance of literature lists numerous infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, mycoplasma and fungi, as potential and specific causes of pneumonia. Serious new respiratory diseases are constantly been discovered, such as SARS and \u2018bird flu\u2019. Lung infections are frequently seen in patients who suffer from other systemic diseases and/or are heavy medicated. Lungs have a weak defense because the lower respiratory system has no resident flora and is a dead\u2010end with no natural drainage. The defense is built on the adhesion of airborne infectious agents to the mucosal membranes in the nasal and oral cavity and the upper respiratory tract, preventing pathogens from reaching the lungs. Factors that interfere with this fragile system are of significance for lung infections. Some respiratory tract infections (e.g. legionellosis and tuberculosis) can potentially be transmitted by aerosols produced during high\u2010speed drilling and ultrasonication, and this is of serious concern in dental practice. Pneumonia can develop in anyone, but is a greater risk in hospitalized and systemically diseased or immunocompromised individuals. Patients who are confined to bed and/or who are mechanically ventilated are at serious risk for pneumonia. Pneumonia is an extremely common cause of sepsis and mortality among the old age people and hospitalized patients.",
