            "text": "In the last 20 years small virus proteins have been identified which enable the flux of ions (reviewed in Refs. [1] [2] [3] . The roles of these viral channel forming proteins are in some cases essential for the virus (e.g., p7 from Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) 4 , M2 from Influenza A) in other cases rather supportive for the viral life cycle as in the case of Vpu from Human Immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and therefore being classified as accessory protein. 5 These proteins are involved in the entry/exit pathway (e.g., M2 from influenza A 6,7 ), in the formation of vesicles (e.g., 2B from polio virus 8 ) or the amplification of viral release (Vpu from HIV-1 9 ) to mention just a few of the known roles. Their topologies range from a single transmembrane (TM) domain (e.g., M2 from influenza A, 6 Vpu from HIV-1 10 ) to two (p7 from HCV, 11,12 2B from Picornavirus 13, 14 ) and even three domains (3a from severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 15 ). The size of most of the proteins is around 100 amino acids, except for 3a with a length of 274 amino acids. 15 All these proteins have in common that they have to oligomerise to function as a channel. In some cases experiments identify specific ion channel characteristics of the proteins preferential selectivity for one type of ion, for example the cation in most of the cases. In other cases experiments find a membrane permeabilizing effect of these proteins for ions as well as substrates and thus they are seen as viroporins 2 or ionophores, 16 lacking typical ion channel characteristics such as selectivity or gating.",

It has a hydrophobic N-terminus which contains the TM domain and a larger cytoplasmic domain of $54 amino acids. Structural information is available for Vpu measured in parts (reviewed in Ref. 18) : the spectroscopic methods used reveal a helical motif for the TM domain and 2-3 helices in the cytoplasmic domain. Vpu is multi-functional as it induces the degradation of CD4 19 and enhances particle release at the site of the plasma membrane by forming ion channels. 20 Ion channel function has so far only been tested in vitro 20-22 and in expression studies with Xenopus oocytes. 23 From reconstitution experiments where either peptides representing the TM part of Vpu or full length Vpu are placed into black lipid bilayers it is shown that the peptide behaves almost like the full length protein with respect to Vpu's conductance levels. 24, 25 In terms of the duration of the open state, the full Vpu stays longer in the open state than the Vpu peptide. 24 These studies indicate that studies on peptides will deliver results attributable to the full length protein. In contrast to M2 for which the mechanism of function is relatively straight forward no studies have yet been done for Vpu in this respect.",

The TM domain is known to alter membrane permeability for ions and substrates when inserted into artificial membranes. Peptides corresponding to the TM domain of Vpu (Vpu 1-32 ) and mutant peptides (Vpu 1-32 -W23L, Vpu 1-32 -R31V, Vpu 1-32 -S24L) have been synthesized and reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayers. All peptides show channel activity with a main conductance level of around 20 pS. Vpu 1-32 -W23L has a considerable flickering pattern in the recordings and longer open times than Vpu 1-32 . Whilst recordings for Vpu 1-32 -R31V are almost indistinguishable from those of the WT peptide, recordings for Vpu 1-32 -S24L do not exhibit any noticeable channel activity. Recordings of WT peptide and Vpu 1-32 -W23L indicate Michaelis-Menten behavior when the salt concentration is increased. Both peptide channels follow the Eisenman series I, indicative for a weak ion channel with almost pore like characteristics.",

For this reason short peptides corresponding to the TM domain of Vpu and three of its mutants have been synthesized and reconstituted into lipid bilayers. On the basis of the current structural 'working' model of an ion conducting bundle of Vpu 18 the following mutations have been investigated (i) a tryptophan at the outside of the bundle has been replaced by leucine, (ii) an arginine by a valine, and (iii) a serine at the C-terminus of the peptide has been replaced by an alanine. Both the arginine and the serine are supposed to point into the lumen of the pore. The mutations have been chosen so that the characteristics of the side chain, for example aromaticity and polarity, are removed but the bulkiness of the side chains is remained.",

Approximately 1 lL of the peptide dissolved in TFE (1.0 mg/mL) was added onto a Delrin cup aperture of 150 lm and dried under N 2 (pretreatment). The lipid suspension was brushed over the aperture to cover it. The lipid bilayer was formed by raising and lowering the level of the buffer (300 mM KCl, 5 mM K 1 -HEPES, pH 5 7.0) in the presence of a constant negative voltage (trans relative to cis) to achieve an asymmetric orientation of the peptides within the bilayer. Experiments were performed at a temperature of T 5 24 AE 18C at which all lipid components are in the liquid crystal phase. The current response was recorded using a MultiClamp 700A system from Axon Instruments (Union City, US) with data filtered at 100 Hz using a Bessel-8-pole lowpass filter. For each of the specified states i (i 5 0, 1, . . ., 4) their mean conductivities and their relative occurrence rates / i have been determined. As the defined states possess different conductance ranges Dj i to obtain / i the number of events N ev,i per state i has been normalized to Dj i , so that / i has been calculated as follows: Fig. 2(B) ]. In addition, at a concentration of 2M KCl an increasing number of the usually barely observed direct transitions from the main-conductance state to a subconductance state with longer remaining periods in the subconductance state can be observed as shown in Figure 2 Recordings with Vpu 1-32 -S24L show hardly any events suggesting that the serine residue is one of the most critical amino acids for bundles of Vpu to conduct ions. The few recorded openings have an average conductivity of 16.7 pS.

On the basis of the current simulated models of bundles of Vpu, 22,37 the tryptophan residues would sit at a position in the membrane with the greatest packing stress (18-24 \u00c5 from the bilayer centre, as shown in electron density profiles of bilayers 38, 39 ) . Replacing the bulky tryptophan with a small residue (leusine) may allow the bundle to expand more giving a larger pore diameter with the consequence of a larger conductance. To explain the long open time it needs to be considered that generally speaking in a thermodynamic equilibrium the values of all parameters with which a system can be described fluctuate around their expectation values. In this situation the further a state, characterized by its set of parameter values, is away from the equilibrium mean state the more seldom this state will be occupied by the system. This means for a system such as a bilayer plus a channel that there is an expectation value for the pressure of the bilayer in the immediate surrounding of the channel. However, the pressure will vary in time. Furthermore, the larger the difference DP between a certain pressure P close , necessary to close a channel, and the expectation value of the bilayer pressure is the less likely this pressure will The given uncertainty corresponds to the standard deviation obtained by a linear fit of the I/V curves comprising between 6 and 10 data points each.",

In the case of Vpu the finding (Table I ) that a shift in conductance occurs when changing the anions proves that anions contribute to the overall conductance of the channel. This rejects possibility (i). Equally changing the cations does also lead to a change in conductance, which indicates that cations contribute to the ion conductance as well, which excludes option (ii). Changing the cation (from Na to K) leads to a stretch and shift of the overall conductance pattern rather than generating a splitting of the conductance states. This proves possibility (iii) wrong, since conductance states which can be assigned to an anion flow should remain at their original conductivity. Thus, being left with option (iv), the conclusion can be drawn that the channel conducts cations and anions during the same opening event and the conductance is in advantage of cations (one anion for 20-30 cations). In addition, it can also be concluded that the different conductance states originate from different conformational states rather than from conducting different types of ions. Since the shift is larger for changing the cations than for changing the anions the conclusion can be drawn that anions and cations contribute with different conductivities to the overall channel conductance.",
