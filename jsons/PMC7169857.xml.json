The majority of BCoV cases previously detected in wild ruminants have been in captive animals. In this study, BCoV was detected in non\u2010captive wild water deer, which may provide further evidence that BCoV could be transmitted between freely ranging wild ruminants and farm ruminants. These findings may attract public attention for BCoV transmission between wild water deer and farms during winter season. In addition, BCoV\u2010like human coronavirus (HECV\u20104408) was demonstrated to be able to infect gnotobiotic calves and provide cross\u2010protection against BCoV infection (Han, Cheon, Zhang, & Saif, 2006), and interspecies transmission of BCoV in turkey poults was also demonstrated under experimental condition (Ismail, Cho, Ward, Saif, & Saif, 2001). Therefore, interspecies transmission ecology of BCoV among livestock, wild animals and humans should be further investigated to control the virus.",
