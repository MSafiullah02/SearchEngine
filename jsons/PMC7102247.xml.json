From 2003 to 2011, over 70,000 service members were evacuated from combat zones in Southwest Asia for non-combat-related illnesses and injuries. Pulmonary conditions were responsible for 3\u20138% of these evacuations. The management of pulmonary diseases in the deployed setting is complicated due to numerous environmental hazards, toxic exposures, and limited resources. This review will summarize the respiratory conditions that require aeromedical evacuation (AE). First, in-theater medical capabilities and then the treatment and diagnosis of pulmonary diseases in the deployed setting will be reviewed. Finally, unique infections and inhalational threats to service members in Southwest Asia will be discussed.",

            "text": "An appreciation of combat medical care is necessary to understand the diagnosis, treatment, and disposition of deployment-related respiratory emergencies. Deployed medical resources are asymmetrically distributed, as the goal of combat medicine is to perform immediate lifesaving interventions and stabilize casualties for transport to higher levels of care. Military doctrine describes a five-tiered disbursement of medical resources through increasing echelons of care [1\u2022]. Echelon I facilities are forward aid medical stations without surgical capabilities. Echelon II comprises medical facilities that perform lifesaving \u201cdamage control\u201d surgery. These facilities have basic laboratory and radiologic capabilities but have minimal holding capacity and lack the ability to perform bronchoscopies or other advanced medical interventions [2]. Echelon III provides surgical subspecialties, robust intensive care capabilities, and more extensive holding capacity. These facilities provide the highest level of in-theater medical care but are often limited by manpower and bed availability. Echelon IV facilities are military hospitals located outside of combat zones, but not within the U.S.A. Echelon V facilities are military hospitals located within the U.S.A. More exhaustive descriptions of AE and military medical doctrine are described elsewhere [1\u2022, 2, 3]. Specialized teams exist to transport patients between higher echelons of care. These include critical care air transport teams (CCATT), a burn flight team, and an acute lung rescue team (ALRT) [1\u2022, 4, 5\u2022].",

From 2003 to 2011, 50,634 service members were evacuated from Iraq. Of those evacuations, 41,690 (82.3%) were for disease and non-battle injuries (DNBI). Pulmonary symptoms and diagnoses accounted for 1167 (2.6%) of evacuations [6]. An echelon II facility in Iraq reported that of 4831 encounters, 4663 (93%) were for DNBI. Of those outpatient encounters, 191 (4%) were for upper respiratory complaints and 56 (1.2%) for asthma or other respiratory issues. During the survey, one soldier was evacuated for asthma [8]. Another analysis of 343 patients evacuated for DNBI showed 3% had underlying pulmonary conditions [9]. Of 875 intensive care unit admissions to a combat support hospital, 125 were admitted for DNBI and 8% were admitted for pulmonary etiologies [10]. Over 11 years, 23,719 personnel were evacuated from Afghanistan. DNBI accounted for 18,144 (76.2%) of these evacuations and 442 (1.9%) were for pulmonary complications [11]. A review of 10 years of CCATT data reveals that of 673 DNBI CCATT missions, 107 (15.9%) were related to pulmonary conditions [12].",

Treatment of ARDS in the deployed setting is similar to that employed elsewhere [22] with an emphasis on treatment of the underlying etiology, lung protective ventilation, and conservative fluid management. In the downrange setting, ARDS is most commonly associated with combat trauma. A review of the U.S. DOD trauma registry revealed approximately 3% of trauma patients developed ARDS. Risk factors for developing ARDS included female sex, more severe injuries, hypotension, and tachycardia on presentation [23]. Patients with ARDS also had higher risk of death and used more resources. Prolonged respiratory support and rehabilitation preclude maintaining these patients in theater [3]. Severe ARDS is the most common reason for activation of the ALRT [4].",

In 2005, a marine platoon suffered an outbreak of Q-fever. No marine required evacuation from theater, but 64 duty days were lost due to the illness [74]. Subsequent reports describe Q-fever-associated cholecystitis and ARDS in deployed service members [75]. The treatment of choice is doxycycline. Given the outbreak potential and the difficulty in diagnosing Q-fever, doxycycline is often added empirically to treat respiratory infections of soldiers in theater [66].",

During the H1N1 influenza pandemic, 6344 Afghan soldiers were seen for respiratory complaints and 319 were deemed to be infected with H1N1. Sixty-one of these soldiers were evacuated to higher levels of care, and 58 of those 61 required treatment for severe pneumonia [78].
