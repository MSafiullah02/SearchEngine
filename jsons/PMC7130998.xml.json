The term implies efficient conception through active gametes, uninterrupted pregnancy, normal delivery of the newborn(s) (\u2018eutocia\u2019), unimpaired lactation of the ewes and survival and optimal growth of the lamb(s). In sheep flocks, increased reproductive efficiency is the cornerstone for profitability; the naturally occurring anoestrus period (the duration of which differs according to the location of flocks) can impede the reproductive efficiency. Hence, maintenance of high reproductive performance of sheep should be a priority for everybody involved (Amiridis and Fthenakis, 2012).",

The article focuses only on direct effects of parasites on the reproductive efficiency of sheep. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that many arthropods (flies, midges, ticks, etc.) can transmit various infective agents, which may adversely affect the reproductive efficiency of sheep. Examples of such agents include Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Stuen and Longbottom, 2011), as well as various viruses, e.g., the Bluetongue virus (Osburn, 2007), the Rift Valley Fever virus (Bath, 2007) and the Schmallenberg virus (Lievaart-Peterson et al., 2012), which have a foetopathic and/or abortifacient effect. In this article, the topics are organised in a pattern according to the reproductive cycle of small ruminants.",

From a practical point of view, puberty for females is the age at which the animal can support pregnancy to term. Puberty is a complex mechanism involving primarily the reactivation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretory system, affected by various factors (Senger, 2003, Ebling, 2005). Among those, energy-deprived animals have been found to have a delayed puberty that has been attributed to a lesser frequency of GnRH pulses and accordingly of luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses (Foster and Olster, 1985, Foster et al., 1985, I\u2019anson et al., 1997, Polkowska et al., 2003). The age at which ewe-lambs are mated, is crucial for productivity of a flock, since cost is high for maintaining unbred animals in a flock. Management of ewe-lambs for enhanced reproductive performance requires increased energy availability. This can be achieved by either increasing energy intake by the animal (i.e., availability of high-energy ration or increased quantity of feed) or by reducing its energy drains (e.g., anthelmintic treatment) (Valasi et al., 2012). Possibly therefore, parasitic infections can have an effect in attainment of puberty through interaction with energy intake as discussed herebelow.",

Administration of a long-acting nematocide anthelmintic, which effectively protected treated ewe-lambs for up to 85 days post-ram introduction, allowed treated animals to exhibit their full reproductive potential during that time (Mavrogianni et al., 2011). Treated ewe-lambs showed earlier reproductive activity, as expressed by short \u2018interval to first mating after ram introduction\u2019 and increased \u2018cycling rate\u2019; this resulted in significantly younger \u2018age at first mating\u2019 (Mavrogianni et al., 2011). Anthelmintic-treated ewe-lambs reached heavier bodyweight, which is a determinant for puberty in sheep (Valasi et al., 2012); thus, they were mated and conceived earlier than untreated controls. There are also similar findings in cattle, showing that nematode-infected heifers reach puberty with a delay compared to uninfected animals (D\u00edaz-Torga et al., 2001).",

Possibly, parasitic infections can directly affect semen quality of rams and, hence, influence conception rates in a flock. Alternatively, changes in testicular function can lead to reduced production of testosterone, which is a determinant of a ram's sexual behaviour and social ranking within a flock (Parkinson, 1996); this may lead to changes in social interactions and behaviours during mating period. All the above can affect conception rates in a flock, especially if the ram:ewe ratio is at the lower acceptable level or if reproductive management techniques are applied in the flock. This is an area where further work will elucidate mechanisms and potential interactions between parasitism and reproduction.",

During that period, adverse developmental origin of the foetus might initiate, as the result of reduced availability of nutrients to the female animal (Fleming et al., 2012). The significance of increased energy available to ewes in the pre-conception period has been recognised for a long time (Clark, 1934, Walkden-Brown et al., 1999, Dobson et al., 2012). Increased energy is provided to ewes by means of modifying the nutritional regime in the period before ewes would be put with rams for mating. At the start of the mating season, ewes should have a body-condition score of \u20183\u2019 to \u20183.5\u2019 on the five-point scale (Lovatt, 2010). \u2018Flushing\u2019 consists of administration of an additional quantity of concentrate feed mixture, on top of the ration administered to cover maintenance requirements of the animals and should commence at least 35 days before start of the mating period; that interval is equivalent to the length of two full oestrous cycles of sheep. In animals with appropriate body-condition score, this increased energy feeding aims to producing higher ovulation numbers, leading to greater number of lambs born per ewe. In animals at lower body condition score, there is a benefit to other reproductive parametres (e.g., earlier start of the annual reproductive activity, improved cycling and lambing rate), but no significant improvement in their fecundity (Heasman et al., 1998, Fthenakis et al., 2012).",

In general, decreased energy availability around the peri-conceptional period, depresses reproductive performance of extensively (Hill Farming Research Organisation, 1979) or intensively (Orskov, 1982) managed sheep and leads to reduced cyclic activity, reduced ovulation rates and suboptimal ova survival, as well as increased risk of early embryonic deaths (Gunn, 1967). Decreased energy availability at the post-conception period leads to compensatory changes in the gravid uterus later in pregnancy, e.g., increased vascular density of the placentomes (Zhu et al., 2007), which in turn can lead to higher risk of foetal infection with parasitic abortifacient agents (Section 6.1), especially in multiple pregnancies; health of the lamb(s) after birth is also adversely affected (Fleming et al., 2012).",

The effects of these parasites in reducing energy availability for their hosts have been well documented (Coop and Kyriazakis, 1999). These authors have proposed that gastrointestinal nematodes can reduce nutrient availability to the host, through a reduction in voluntary feed intake and/or a reduction in the efficiency of absorbed nutrients; the relative contribution of each of these two mechanisms depend on the species of parasite and its location in the gastrointestinal tract (Coop and Kyriazakis, 1999). With regard to trematode infections, reduced feed conversion efficiency, present even in low burden infections (Hawkins and Morris, 1978), as well as depressed appetite and feed intake, also occurring in these helminthoses (Taylor et al., 2007, Rojo-V\u00e1zquez et al., 2012), contribute to decreased energy availability for affected sheep.",

In dairy-type production systems, anthelmintic administration at the pre-conception period (which coincides with the end of a lactation period) would also contribute to maintaining a longer persistency of lactation (another energy-dependent function), although drug withdrawal periods (Athanasiou et al., 2009) should be taken into account when designing strategic treatments. Finally, anthelmintic administration before the mating season has the added advantage of avoiding the inadverted administration of albendazole or netobimin, broad-spectrum anthelmintics with confirmed embryotoxic properties (Delatour et al., 1981, Navarro et al., 1998), to ewes at the first stage of pregnancy.",

            "text": "Prolactin is a peptide hormone, responsible for initiating and sustaining lactation in ewes (Castro et al., 2011). It acts in a cytokine-like manner and as an important regulator of the immune system (Rovensky et al., 1991). Blood concentrations of prolactin in pregnant ewes start to increase from the 115th\u2013135th day of gestation (Banchero et al., 2006). Beasley et al., 2010a, Beasley et al., 2010b reported that, in ewes experimentally infected with Trichostrongylus colubriformis, the rise in faecal egg counts at the end of pregnancy had been preceded by a decrease in the immunological competence of the ewes; this was shown by reduced numbers of circulating eosinophils and by decreased total antibody and IgG1 titres. The changes coincided with increased prolactin concentrations at the end of pregnancy, but, nevertheless, the authors considered that they were unrelated to hormonal effects; this confirmed a similar earlier hypothesis by Coop et al. (1990). As significant differences have been reported in blood concentrations of prolactin according to season (Gomez Brunet and Lopez Sebastian, 1991), the peri-parturient rise in faecal parasitic output should have differed in accord with time of the year. According to Coop and Kyriazakis (1999), this relaxation of immunity and the ensuing increase in faecal egg counts appear to have a nutrition-based background. Under the conditions of high metabolic demand, which occur at the end of pregnancy, susceptibility of ewes to gastrointestinal parasites is increased (Kahn et al., 2003). Finally, Coop and Kyriazakis (1999) proposed a nutritional, rather than an endocrinological, involvement in the relaxation of immunity during that period and presented the following arguments: (a) grade of immunity expression in pregnant ewes is consistent with the reproductive effort, i.e., the number of foetuses borne, (b) termination of pregnancy leads to abrupt restoration of immunity and (c) nutritional management of pregnant ewes can alter the time of first observation of the relaxation. Beasley et al. (2012) reported that feeding ewes a low quality diet resulted in a peri-parturient rise in faecal parasitic output starting 24 days before lambing and increasing substantially thereafter, whilst in ewes fed a high quality diet there was only a short rise of small magnitude; these findings lend further support to the above theory.",

During the first 100 days of pregnancy, there is a slow foetal growth (Blanchart and Sauvant, 1974, Economides and Louca, 1981); during the second month of pregnancy, when foetal attachment has been established and placental growth has been completed, foetus(es) can acquire up to 15\u201325% of their future birth bodyweight; finally, at the last stage of pregnancy, the ovine foetus(es) can develop rapidly, to acquire up to 75\u201380% of their future birth bodyweight (Fthenakis et al., 2012). Hence, energy requirements of pregnant ewes increase, as the end of pregnancy is approaching. In the final month of gestation, protein requirements of pregnant ewes also increase, due to foetal requirements and the need to prepare colostrum in the mammary glands (Fthenakis et al., 2012). The situation may be aggravated in cases of heavy parasitic infections, as parasites increase the energy requirements of their hosts (Coop et al., 1977, Dakkak, 1990), as well as protein synthesis by the host, and consequently protein requirements, due to tissue invasion and damage (Solomons, 1993).",

The authors attributed that on the direct effects that trematodes exert on the liver of affected sheep, as well as on the general energy drain effects of parasitism on the pregnant animals; they suggested that in flocks where many risk factors for pregnancy toxaemia would accumulate (e.g., suboptimal feeding), synergistic effect of those, coupled with trematode infection, could lead to clinical cases of pregnancy toxaemia.",

Active metabolites of these drugs can cross the placenta and reach the foetal blood circulation (Capece et al., 2002). Often, the affected foetuses are absorbed or expelled, so ewes will be seen as barren animals at the end of the lambing season. Consequently, if there is a need for administration of these drugs, they should be given before start of the mating period, as pre-conception administration of the drug does not appear to cause a foetopathic effect during the subsequent pregnancy (Teruel et al., 2011). Otherwise, anthelmintic drugs with no foetopathic effects must be used. The precaution should extend to later stages of the breeding season, if rams remain with ewes for a long period of time, as there is always the possibility for some ewes to have been mated later in the season (Fthenakis et al., 2012).",

Also, presence of connective tissue can lead to difficulties in dilatation of the birth canal, which may also lead to dystocia. Dystocia may also occur in cases of births of malformed embryos, formed consequently to albendazole/netobimin administration at the first stage of pregnancy (Section 6.4). Finally, Leontides et al. (2000) have postulated that D. dendriticum-infection may act as a risk factor for retention of foetal membranes in ewes during the subsequent lambing; they attributed the effect to the reduced energy availability of parasitised ewes, which may affect leucocyte function of ewes, a determinant of placental retention (Azawi, 2008), that way potentially associating the parasitic infection with the increased incidence of the reproductive disorder in ewes.",

Results of direct studies of potential milk yield reduction due to parasitism, in the growth of lambs of the affected ewes are not available and can only inferred from the above reports. Reduced milk yield of ewes leads to suboptimal growth rate of lambs (Fthenakis and Jones, 1990) and, during the neonatal period, even to increased death rate of lambs (Dwyer, 2008, Brozos et al., 2011). In this context, it is noteworthy the report by Juste Jord\u00e1n and Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez (1991), who found that adverse effects of parasitism in milk yield were more pronounced at the final stage of lactation, when, however, there is little dependence of lambs on maternal milk, as they consume solid feed. The nutritive value of milk is also dependent upon its composition. Nevertheless, a variety of factors can influence milk composition (e.g., nutrition, genetics, stage of lactation, mammary health), which may be difficult to control in order to test potential adverse effects of parasitism; that may explain the unclear results among the respective studies.",

The disease is an infectious enteritis that causes high morbidity and mortality of affected animals. It is caused by the enteric protozoa Cryptosporidium spp., which can affect newborns alone or in mixed infection with Escherichia coli or viruses affecting the intestinal tract (e.g., Rotavirus, Coronavirus) (Chatzopoulos et al., 2013). Cryptosporidium spp. are located at the microvilli in the intestine of affected lambs and impair intestinal function. The disease causes suboptimal growth rate and often death of affected animals, leading to heavy economic losses in the sheep industry. Lambs which survive infection at a young age, remain asymptomatic carriers and shed oocysts, contributing to increased environmental contamination and infection of newborn lambs.",

Specific works in lambs have not been reported. In calves, infection with Giardia duodenalis can lead to loss of the epithelial barrier function, villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in the small intestine, changes which may result in clinical disease usually characterised by intermittent diarrhoea (Ruest et al., 1997). In any case, the lesions would cause malabsorption, leading to suboptimal weight gain, reduced feed-efficiency and ill-thriftiness of the affected animals (Olson et al., 1995, Buret, 2007, Sweeny et al., 2012).

These parasites are of importance in mutton-type production systems, where lambs remain with their dams for over 100 days of age (Sargison, 2009). In contrast to that, in dairy-type production systems, lambs are weaned at a younger age (Gelasakis et al., 2010) and, usually, are taken for slaughter; hence, chances for building up a significant production-limiting parasitic burden are minimal. Gastrointestinal nematode infections cause significant growth retardation or delay in age of slaughter, which have been documented repeatedly in the older to the more recent scientific literature (Coop et al., 1984, Sweeny et al., 2012). The significant financial losses associated with the growth retardation of unweaned lambs have led to the need for frequent anthelmintic treatments in these animals, which, in turn, have led to development of widespread anthelmintic resistance in sheep flocks around the world (Papadopoulos et al., 2012, Torres-Acosta et al., 2012). Currently, many strategies for anthelmintic treatment of lambs in mutton-type production systems have been advocated, with emphasis given to strategic administration of the drugs (Sargison, 2011, Sargison, 2012).",
