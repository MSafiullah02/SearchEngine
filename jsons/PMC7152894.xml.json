            "text": "The family Coronaviridae consists of four genera, namely, Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV), Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4CoV) (Chen et al., 2020). Viruses from this family possess a single stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length (Su et al., 2016). Coronaviruses (CoV) have been identified in several avian hosts, as well as in mammals, including humans, bats, civets, mice, dogs, cats, cows and camels (Clark, 1993; Cavanagh, 2007; Zhou et al., 2018). Although several CoV are pathogenic to humans, most of them are associated with mild clinical symptoms (Su et al., 2016). Nevertheless, two notable exceptions have been described: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a novel \u03b2CoV that emerged in southern China in 2002 (Peiris et al., 2004) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of more than 30 CoVs. Interactions among various bat species themselves, bat-animal and bat-human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets in China, have been proved to be important for interspecies transmission of CoVs (Wong et al., 2019). In fact, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV likely originated in bats, and genetically diverse CoVs that are related to these viruses were discovered in bats worldwide (Cui et al., 2019). Previous studies in different bat species from China permitted the identification of at least 41 new \u03b2CoV, all of them were Rhinolophus spp. bat-CoV (Lin et al., 2017).",

As February 26th, 2020, there have been 77,780 cases of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in China, including 2,666 deaths (WHO, 2020a). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in 33 countries outside China, with 2,459 cases confirmed and 34 deaths (WHO, 2020a).

A statistically significant difference among CAI values was addressed applying a Wilcoxom & Mann-Whitney test (Wessa, 2012). In order to discern if statistically significant differences in the CAI values arise from codon preferences, we used e-CAI (Puigbo et al., 2008b) to calculate the expected value of CAI (eCAI) at the 95 % confident interval. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the expected CAI was also performed (Puigbo et al., 2008b).",

            "text": "The frequencies of RSCU in SARS-CoV-2 ORFs are significantly different in relation to human cells. Highly biased frequencies were found for UUU (Phe), UUA (Leu), CUU (Leu), AUU (Ile), AUA (Ile), GUU (Val), UAU (Tyr), CAU (His), CAA (Gln), AAU (Asp), GAA (Glu), UCU (Ser), CCU (Pro), CCA (Pro), GCU (Ala), UGU (Cys), CGU (Arg), AGA (Arg), and GGU (Gly). As it can be seen, most of the highly preferred codons are A and U-ending, while most of the highly underrepresented codons are C and G-endind codons, particularly CG containing codons. These results strongly suggest that mutational bias is a main force shaping codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 (see Table 1). In fact, when the occurrences of dinucleotides are established, they are not random and no dinucleotide is present at the expected frequencies (see Supplementary material Table 2). The relative abundances of CpG and CpC and GpG showed a strong deviation from the expected frequencies (i.e. 1.0) (mean \u00b1 S.D. = 0.22 \u00b1 0.00, 0.48 \u00b1 0.00 and 0.66 \u00b1 0.00, respectively) and were markedly under-represented. Cytosine deamination and selection against CpG motifs have been proposed as two independent selection forces that shape codon usage bias in CoV (Woo et al. 2007), suggesting that immune selection may play a role in SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias. On the other hand, UpU, ApA, UpG are markedly over-used (mean \u00b1 S.D. = 1.96 \u00b1 0.00, 1.55 \u00b1 0.00 and 1.40 \u00b1 0.00, respectively) (Supplementary material Table 2). These results indicate that the composition of dinucleotides also determines the variation in synonymous codon usage among SARS-CoV-2 strains. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 RSCU values with the ones of SARS-CoV (Gu et al., 2004) and MERS-CoV (Chen et al., 2017) revealed a similar pattern for most of the codons (Table 1). Highly underrepresented codons ACG (Thr), GCG (Ala) and GGG (Gly) were observed in all three viruses in relation to human cells (Table 1). On the other hand, significant differences in frequencies of two glutamine codons (GAG and GAA) were observed among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS and MERS-CoVs (Table 1). While GAG codon frequency is significantly different from the expected frequency (i.e. 1.0) in SARS-CoV-2 (0.55), it is not in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses (0.96 and 0.95, respectively). In the case of GAA, this codon is highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 (1.45) and its frequency is very near the expected frequency in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs (1.04 and 1.05, respectively). These results suggest that although a general codon usage pattern among human \u03b2CoV can be found, each virus may evolve to a unique codon usage in its adaptation to the host\u2019cells.",

The results of these studies revealed an e-CAI value of 0.719 (p < 0.05). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed a normal distribution of the generated sequences (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of e-CAI value of 0.028, which is below critical value of 0.061).

This is in agreement with very recent studies revealing that SARS-CoV-2 is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting \u03b2CoV (Lu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). This distinct genomic composition is also reflected in its codon and amino acid usage patterns (see Fig. 2). Moreover, correlation distances and average linkage suggests a closer relation among SARS-CoV-2 and bats \u03b2CoV isolated in China and a more distant relation to SARS-CoV or SARS-like \u03b2CoV isolated from civets or ferrets (see Fig. 2). This is in agreement with recent results suggesting that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan (Lu et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020b). This speaks of the importance of bats as a reservoir of potential emerging CoV. Moreover, significant numbers of new \u03b2CoV have been discovered in Chinese bats species, particularly Rhinolophus affinis (Lin et al., 2017). Interestingly, a clear degree of variation in codon and amino acid usage was observed among \u03b2CoV isolated from bats included in these studies (see Fig. 2). Nevertheless, bats might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 in humans (Wong et al., 2019). More studies will be needed to address this important issue.",

This bias can also have a major influence on derived parameters, as previously demonstrated for other CoVs (Berkhout and Van Hemert, 2015). This is in agreement with the results of this work, since the nucleotide composition of SARS-CoV-2 has a strong influence in the codons that are used by this virus for the translation of its RNA genome. Previous studies on codon usage in RNA viruses have shown that mutational pressure is the major factor in shaping codon usage patterns in comparison with natural selection (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003; Wang et al., 2011). Although mutational pressure is still a major driving force, it is certainly not the only evolutionary force that might be considered in RNA viruses. In these studies, a significant A genomic content was found in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other human CoVs (Fig. 3). Previous studies done in Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) found that this virus has an A-rich genome and this property has been proposed to help the virus to avoid recognition by the innate immune system (Vabret et al., 2012). This could provide a strong selective pressure on retroviruses as well as many others RNA viruses, including CoVs (Kindler and Thiel, 2014; van Hemert et al., 2014). Moreover, previous studies done in HIV suggest that an RNA genome with A-rich domains may provide a molecular signature that is recognized during virus replication (van Hemert et al., 2013). In the context of CoV, A-rich regions, like the Transcription Regulation Sequence (TRS), which is involved in transcription of sub-genomics RNAs have been established (Pyrc et al., 2004). This suggest that nucleotide bias may serve distinct biological function in SARS-CoV-2 as well as in other CoVs and is in direct relation to the characteristic codon usage of these viruses (Berkhout and Van Hemert, 2015).",
