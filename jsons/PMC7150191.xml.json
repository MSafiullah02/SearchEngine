The healthcare workers at the surveillance departments of sentinel hospitals collected throat swab specimens from ILI cases and completed the \u201cBeijing Influenza Surveillance Sampling Information Form\u201d which contained basic information of the cases, their contact information, symptoms, whether or not they used vaccine and antiviral drugs, etc. The form and the collected specimens were then delivered to the predefined influenza surveillance network laboratories for influenza virus isolation and identification. The subjects for sample collection were ILI cases who presented with symptoms in the last 3 days and never took antiviral drugs. Each sentinel hospital was required to collect at least 20 specimens weekly, avoiding cluster sampling. Specimens collected were delivered to influenza virological surveillance network laboratories within 24 h for testing. Each network laboratory was required to report the test results of the specimens to the Beijing CDC by 12:00 a.m. of each Friday. The test results offered information about the prevalent strains of influenza virus and the intensity of their activities. This served as the golden standard to for the verification and evaluation of the overall effectiveness of influenza early warning through ILI case surveillance.",

Its overall aim was to play a role in early outbreak detection, reporting, diagnosis, isolation, and treatment of diarrhea cases. The system began at a probationary or trial stage in 2006 and was officially launched throughout the city in Apr. 2008. According to the regulations of Beijing with regard to the prevention and control of enteric infectious diseases, all diarrhea cases presenting in hospitals must undergo triage to understand the specific enteric disease clinics they needed to be referred to, and be included as the targets for surveillance in the Early Warning Surveillance System in Intestinal Outpatients of Beijing. Diarrhea cases were defined as three or more stools per day. The surveillance sites were situated in the 335 enteric disease clinics in hospitals at different levels across Beijing. The enteric disease clinics open on Apr. 1 of each year, providing 24-h service. Except for a few enteric disease clinics operating in winter, other enteric disease clinics close on Oct. 31. From Nov. to the following Mar. (low-epidemic period of enteric infectious diseases), only one or two enteric disease clinics continue working in each district/county. The health care workers at the enteric disease clinics are asked to record the information about each diarrhea case, covering the general demographics, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, diagnosis and treatment, and reported via network through Early Warning Surveillance System in Intestinal Outpatients of Beijing. The district/county CDCs are responsible for the review of the input information every day to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information input. In order to detect suspected cholera cases, attending doctors were required to collect stool specimens from each diarrhea case for routine stool examination, vibrio cholera-suspension tests, stool vibrio cholera culture, and other tests. If the cases were determined as cases requiring medical observation for cholera (suspected cases or confirmed cases), field investigation and management would be conducted according to the management protocol for cholera cases. In Early Warning Surveillance System in Intestinal Outpatients of Beijing, a CUSUM algorithm was applied to conducting temporal and geographical analysis. And the system would generate early warning signals in real-time for clustering diarrhea cases or suspected outbreak that are correlated by time or region.",

Since the surveillance data collected by SSSBOG (a subsystem of BOG-IDSS) represented events of suspected epidemiological clusters, rather than information about single cases, an absolute value method was applied for early warning. For the early warning thresholds, see Table 8.5\n, the 157 medical stations inside of the Olympic venues required attending physicians to send early warning signals once they identified one case with fever, diarrhea, jaundice, rash, or conjunctivitis among any Olympic Games related staff members and to immediately report to the public health security team within the stadiums. The public health security team would then conduct an initial epidemiological investigation to trace contacts and verify the diagnosis. Outside the Olympic stadiums, whenever outpatient/emergency care physicians at the 125 sentinel hospitals in Beijing detected any patients or close contacts fitting the case definition (i.e., three or more persons with fever; three or more persons with diarrhea; two or more persons with jaundice; two or more persons with rash; three or more persons with conjunctivitis), they were asked to report this online, prompting the local CDCs to conduct an epidemiological investigation and confirm the existence of the cluster.",

During the Olympic Games, Early Warning Surveillance System for Influenza of Beijing detected no aberration; Early Warning Surveillance System in Intestinal Outpatients of Beijing detected four aberrations. Field investigations revealed that there was no shared exposure history among those cases and finally excluded the possibility of epidemiological association while in fact were just irrelevant sporadic events. The results were consistent with the fact that there was no major outbreak or epidemics during the game-time, indicating that the BOG-IDSS in Beijing was sensitive and effective.",

The early warning thresholds in SSSBOG were lower, and attending physicians were required to ask about similar symptoms among close contacts of case-patients and thus suspected joint exposure history among patients and their close contacts were identified earlier. Therefore, the system exhibited that it could detect more aberrations, with higher sensitivity and timeliness. Regular or traditional infectious disease early warning surveillance (i.e., CIDARS, Early Warning Surveillance System for Influenza of Beijing and Early Warning Surveillance System in Intestinal Outpatients of Beijing) are based on analysis of cases who visited hospitals. When the level actually observed exceeds the upper threshold, early warning signals are triggered.",

When the magnitude of the outbreak is small, it is hard to detect this kind of minor aberration using summarized case numbers. Additionally, even if CUSUM model detects an abnormal rise in case numbers through summarized data, CDC staff members still have difficulties in determining the exact region and period of the cluster, something that requires further exploration. For diarrhea cases visiting enteric disease clinics, the basic and diagnostic information of the cases are collected, which is mandatory. However, the present addresses, working places and other information of the cases were a challenge to code in a uniform manner. If cases with joint exposure history lived or visited hospitals in different areas, or worked in different agencies or studied in different schools, traditional surveillance systems could hardly detect this cluster in a timely manner. Therefore, SSSBOG can be an important supplement and complement to CIDARS, Early Warning Surveillance System for Influenza of Beijing and Early Warning Surveillance System in Intestinal Outpatients of Beijing.",

Meanwhile, medical staff in CDC's jurisdiction would verify that information further and screen suspected related cases based on the clues about the current epidemic situation.
