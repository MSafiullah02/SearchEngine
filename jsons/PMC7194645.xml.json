Here we attempted to uncover their characteristics by comparative analysis on crude fatality ratios (CFRs).",

Results displayed in Fig. 1C revealed i) CFRs in Iran, Italy and USA in the past ten days are not significantly different from Hubei (P being 0.24, 0.648 and 0.281, respectively); ii) CFR in USA is not significantly different from Wuhan to marginal degree (P being 0.0504); iii) CFR in Iran from 22 February to 2 March is significantly different from any regions of China (p<0.001; Table S1). In view of the detailed P values among all pairs (Table S1), we suppose the ranking for the severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in different countries/regions in terms of CFRs as follows: Iran>Wuhan>Hubei\u2248USA\u2248Italy>outside Wuhan \u2248Spain\u2248Japan\u2248France>South Korea\u2248outside Hubei.",

In Hubei/Wuhan there were neither sufficient COVID-19 test kits for infection identification nor enough beds in hospitals for effective treatments of patients in the early stage of the outbreak.6 These shortages led to numerous transmissions in households, reduced the apparent number of cumulative confirmed cases and caused mild patients without treatments to become severe/critical ones and even die, as implicated by earlier reports.4\n,\n7 As such, CFRs in Hubei/Wuhan was relatively high in the early stage.5\n,\n7 Similar CFRs between Hubei and USA/Italy, suggest that these countries may face similar situations at present as Hubei had experienced before. In support of this, recent news reports show that Italy is extremely short of medica resources (beds and acute care equipment) while USA has some problems in COVID-19 testing capacity.8 In Iran, these problems might be even more severe such that its CFR is extremely high. To fight against the COVDI-19 outbreaks in these Hubei/Wuhan-like countries, governments may need to implement control measures and timely supply medical resources as Hubei/Wuhan had done in the past month.2\n,\n4\n",
