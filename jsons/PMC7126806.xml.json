            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major cause of disease in domestic fowl and causes an acute, highly contagious disease of the respiratory tracts and sometimes also urogential tracts [1]. Current diagnostic assays for IBV include virus isolation in embryonating eggs or tracheal organ cultures, cell culture immunoassays and molecular assays that detect the viral RNA [2]. Virus isolation is generally considered the gold standard, but it is expensive and time consuming because several passages may be required to detect the virus. Immunoassays routinely use IBV-specific monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus in direct or indirect fluorescent antibody and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay formats. Although the immunoassays are more rapid and simpler than virus isolation, which tend to lack specificity and sensitivity and none detect all strains or types of IBV [3], [4], [5]. Molecular assays for the detection of IBV are used commonly because they provide highly specific and sensitive results and can detect viral RNA directly from clinical samples or from viral isolates in a laboratory host system. Although RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR methods are applied widely in the laboratories [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], RT-LAMP need more simple device such as water bath or heat block and has high efficiency because there is no time loss for thermal change due to its isothermal reaction.",

An inner primer containing sequences of the sense and antisense strands of the target DNA initiates LAMP reaction (Fig. 1\n). The final products are stem-loop DNAs with several inverted repeats of the target and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops formed by annealing between alternately inverted repeats of the target in the same strand. Because LAMP recognizes the target by six distinct sequences initially and by four distinct sequences afterwards, it is expected to amplify the target sequence with high selectivity. The advantage of the LAMP assay is simple and easy to perform once the appropriate primers and a regular laboratory water bath or heat block are prepared for reaction. LAMP is also applicable to RNA upon use of reverse transcriptase (RTase) together with DNA polymerase [14].",

IBV01 was used to standardize the IBV RT-LAMP assay. The vaccine strains of H120 and M41 were supplied by a local vaccine manufacturer. The other viruses, including Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian reovirus (ARV), and infectious laryngotrachietis virus (ILTV) were also from CVMCC and used to examine the specificity of IBV RT-LAMP. The median egg infectious dose (EID50) of the IBV01 virus used in sensitivity tests was calculated according to the Reed and Muench formula.

In addition, the reaction time of RT-LAMP method is 45 min, which is more rapid than conventional RT-PCR, and the reaction only needs a laboratory water bath. Another useful feature was RT-LAMP products could be directly observed by the addition of dyes, as the original orange color of SYBR green I would turn to be green in the positive reaction mixture. From a practical point of view, RT-LAMP is more suitable as a routine diagnostic tool, especially in clinics in which complicated equipment such as thermal cycling machines and electrophoresis apparatus are not available. In addition, RT-LAMP has a potential for field diagnosis. Nonetheless, the reliability of this assay should be further evaluated by large-scale investigation.",
