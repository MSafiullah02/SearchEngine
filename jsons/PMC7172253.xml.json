The mean age of these children was 2.1 years. The overall prevalence of HBoV-specific IgG and IgM in children without detectable viral genomes in nasopharyngeal samples was 35% and 13%, respectively. Antibodies against the aminoterminal domain of the viral VP1 protein, termed VP1-unique region, were detected rarely: only 7% (IgG) and 2% (IgM) of the patients showed positive results. In contrast to the data provided by Endo and colleagues and by our group (see below), the prevalence of HBoV-specific IgG was shown to decline from 52% in 1\u20132 year old infants to 29% in children aged over 5 years in the Finnish study.21 Furthermore, maternal VP2-specific IgG were not observed in children <6 months of age despite a seemingly high seroprevalence of HBoV in adults. This finding may be due to the maturation of IgG-specificity in the time period of up to 6 months following an acute infection, during which antibodies against linear epitopes get replaced by those preferentially recognizing conformational antigen structures. This process has been well documented for B19V-specific humoral immune responses,71 and therefore it may be assumed that similar changes in IgG affinity take place during HBoV infections.",

Despite these high rates of co-infection, HBoV viremia has been frequently described to be significantly more prevalent in infants suffering from ARTIs than in age-matched asymptomatic control groups,24, 26, 28, 43, 51 and therefore a role of HBoV in the development of human respiratory diseases is to be presumed. This finding is supported by our data, which show a significantly higher prevalence of HBoV infections in young children with lower respiratory tract infections (14.6%, 7/48) as compared to a control group of age-matched individuals hospitalized due to non-infectious conditions such as bone fractures or planned surgeries (5.0%, 3/60).",

Based on current reports it seems most likely that HBoV may be associated with respiratory infections in young children and infants, while a further connection between HBoV and gastrointestinal symptoms has been suggested. However, as acute HBoV infections are often accompanied by infections with additional pathogens of both the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, a final establishment of HBoV as the causative agent of infectious disease in humans needs to be confirmed by additional prospective studies. The methodological heterogeneity used for the diagnosis of HBoV infection raises questions about the specificity and comparability of many published studies, highlighting the urgent need of internationally standardized diagnostic guidelines and reference samples for the detection of HBoV genomes and virus-specific immune responses in human samples. As serological diagnostics of HBoV infection will become more important in the future, standardized viral DNA and antibody specimen should be provided as a basis to establish comparable test systems.",
