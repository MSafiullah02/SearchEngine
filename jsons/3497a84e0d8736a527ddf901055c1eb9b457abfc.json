Despite the wide array of diagnostic tools, invasive techniques, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), are often required to obtain adequate specimens. PneumoniaCheck TM is a new device that collects aerosol particles from cough, allowing microbiological analyses. Up to now it has been tested only for bacteria detection, but no study has investigated its usefulness for virus identification. Methods: In this pilot study we included 12 consecutive patients with pneumonia. After testing cough adequacy via a peak flow meter, a sampling with PneumoniaCheck TM was collected and a BAL was performed in each patient. Microbiological analyses for virus identification were performed on each sample and concordance between the two techniques was tested (sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values), taking BAL results as reference. Results: BAL was considered adequate in 10 patients. Among them, a viral pathogen was identified by PneumoniaCheck TM 6 times, each on different samples, whereas BAL allowed to detect the presence of a virus on 7 patients (14 positivities). Overall, the specificity for PneumoniaCheck TM to detect a virus was 100%, whereas the sensitivity was 66%. When considering only herpes viruses, PneumoniaCheck TM showed a lower sensitivity, detecting a virus in 1/4 of infected patients (25%). Conclusions: In this pilot study PneumoniaCheck TM showed a good correlation with BAL for non-herpes virologic identification in pneumonia patients, providing excellent specificity.

In CAP, some of the most important viruses involved are Influenza and Parainfluenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus, Coronavirus and Rinhovirus [36, 38] and they can be detected through analyses of serum samples, cultures, rapid diagnostic testing with enzyme immunoassay or immunofluorescence [39, 40] . Nevertheless, the introduction of PCR has increased the diagnostic yields, compared to the conventional diagnostic procedures [41] . Despite all these tools, it remains difficult in some cases to determine whether one of these pathogens is involved in the development of the infection. As a matter of fact, it is considered that only the detection of the Influenza virus can be seen as an actual etiologic factor and not as colonisation.

The same study evaluated the collection proprieties of the filter by testing the viral filtration efficiency, which resulted to be 99.9975%, with a mean particle size of 2.8 \u03bcm. With this results the authors confirmed both that the filter used in the PneumoniaCheck TM is able to capture 99.99% of viruses in aerosol particles and that PCR analysis on bacterial DNA could be performed (notably, the authors evaluated the efficacy of RT-PCR only for bacteria and not for viruses).
