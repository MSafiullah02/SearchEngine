This is a cause for concern, as some virologists believe that previous human flu pandemics, such as the one in 1918 that killed millions, originated in pigs. Yet neither the World Health Organization (WHO) nor the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was aware of the results when they were published. Last week both groups were hurriedly trying to get the papers translated.",

The results, which show that the virus was found in 2003 in pigs in southeast China, were originally published in January1. A second paper by Chen and her colleagues appeared in May, reporting similar results from pigs tested elsewhere in 2001 and 20032.",

But this might change if pigs are infected, says Malik Peiris, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong . The virus could exchange genes with the human flu strains that infect pigs and combine to become far more infectious to humans, he warns. Peiris's group has already shown that a human virus, H3N2, can coexist with other avian influenza viruses and is widespread in pigs from southeast China. Pigs are an \"ideal mixing vessel\", he says. \"It is certainly sufficient to make me concerned.\"",

Until then, they urge caution and say that the significance of the findings cannot yet be judged.",
