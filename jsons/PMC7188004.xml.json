Italy, the first European country to be affected by COVID-19, declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020. Because of increasing morbidity and mortality in the northern region of Italy, a national lockdown was instituted on March 9, 2020. From that date, we stopped all elective bariatric and endoscopic surgeries in our surgical department to prevent transmission of the infection to patients and health care workers. Almost all national guidelines worldwide recommend postponing elective surgery and endoscopy [1] and protocols are updated daily to minimize the risk of infection during hospital treatments.",

Over 80% of patients with COVID-19 infection are asymptomatic [4] or paucisymptomatic [5], and with increasing numbers of such infections, more surgical patients will present with coinfection. Therefore, it is of upmost importance to suspect COVID-19 infection in every patient and to define a preoperative diagnostic pathway to exclude it as far as possible. Ethically, semi-urgent surgical and endoscopic procedures might be the most challenging conditions. Despite some existing recommendations, it is the responsibility of the practitioner to decide which procedure should be performed or must be postponed for each individual patient after analyzing the ethics and risk\u2013benefit ratio.",

After the national lockdown and initial postponing of all elective endoscopic and surgical procedures, we were still confronted with increased uncertainty regarding the duration, course, and impact of this pandemic. This resulted in new considerations regarding the timing of explantation of an intragastric balloon (IB) for which the guaranteed implantation time has been exceeded. To avoid future ulcerations, perforations, and ileuses caused by failed IB material and the risk of possible emergency interventions, we have classified the removal of an IB as a semi-urgent intervention and no longer postpone this procedure.",
