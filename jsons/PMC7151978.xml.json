Some of these microbes cause diseases of global importance (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, rotavirus diarrheal disease; and the (H1N1) 2009 influenza pandemic). Others appear to be limited (thus far) to particular countries or continents (e.g. Ebola hemorrhagic fever in central Africa (although simian Ebola has also been identified in the Philippines); Argentinian, Bolivian, Venezuelan and Sabia-associated hemorrhagic fevers in South America; hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the Americas; and new variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Saudi Arabia). A recent example is the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus, which spread overnight from Hong Kong to Canada and several other countries by airplane (Fig. 4.2\n; see also below). In addition to these newly identified diseases, several \u2018old\u2019 threats have re-emerged in new or drug-resistant forms (Table 4.3\n). These include highly virulent epidemic strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (see below) and Clostridium difficile.10,\n11\n",

In 1999, the first US outbreak of West Nile encephalitis was identified when an infectious disease physician reported unusual neurologic disease in three elderly people who lived in the same area (Fig. 4.3\n).12\nWest Nile encephalitis \u2013 whose causative agent is carried by migratory birds in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe and transmitted to humans by mosquito bite \u2013 had never before been reported in the Western hemisphere.13 In 2000, physicians in New York, London and Toronto helped identify an international outbreak of leptospirosis among athletes returning home from a competition in Malaysian Borneo. These physicians reported their findings to Geosentinel, the surveillance network of the International Society of Travel Medicine (http://www.istm.org/geosentinel/main.html), which alerted travel clinics in 11 countries. An astute clinician was also responsible for reporting the first cases of a multistate outbreak of Cyclospora infection that was associated with imported raspberries.14 Later cases were detected in 20 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces.",

In addition, the federal, state and local public health laboratories are also linked with agricultural, wildlife and military reference laboratories through the Laboratory Response Network (LRN), which was founded in 1998 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in partnership with the Association of Public Health Laboratories and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).",

The special challenges of understanding the ecologic factors that favor the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases are discussed below.Box 4.1Agricultural costs of controlling diseases carried by food animalsWhen a dangerous animal-borne disease threatens human health or food safety, a government may be forced to slaughter large numbers of food animals as a control measure, despite considerable economic costs. Recent examples include two zoonotic diseases (Nipah encephalitis and H5N1 in\ufb02uenza) and two veterinary diseases (foot and mouth disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; also called mad cow disease)). Ingestion of beef containing the causative agent of BSE (a prion) may result in the development of a fatal human neurodegenerative illness (new variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease) many years later.Between 1997 and 2007, the culling of animals to control outbreaks of Nipah encephalitis, avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, and BSE cost the agricultural sector billions of dollars.\u2022\nNipah encephalitis. In 1999 Malaysian health authorities were faced with an outbreak of encephalitis among farm workers, which had a nearly 50% mortality rate. The cause was a previously unknown paramyxovirus called the Nipah virus, which is carried by bats. To control the outbreak, approximately 1.1 million pigs were culled within a few weeks, severely harming the Malaysian meat industry.\u2022\nAvian in\ufb02uenza (strain H5N1). In 1997, a similar precautionary measure was taken by the government of Hong Kong, which arranged the culling of all 1.6 million chickens on Hong Kong Island and the New Territories to prevent chicken-to-human transmission of a virulent avian form of in\ufb02uenza.The 2003 re-emergence of avian influenza A[H5N1] in South East Asia \u2013 and its consequent spread to Central Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East \u2013 has also had a significant economic impact. In South East Asia, for example, bird deaths due to disease and to bird cullings have caused severe losses to farmers in Vietnam and Thailand (whose poultry stocks declined by 15\u201320%), as well as to farmers in Indonesia, China, Cambodia and Laos. According to the World Bank, economic impacts in these countries have also affected poultry traders, feed mills and breeding farms (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPHALFYEARLYUPDATE/0,contentMDK:20708543\u223cmenuPK:550232\u223cpage PK:64168445\u223cpiPK:64168309\u223ctheSitePK:550226,00.html).\u2022\nBovine spongiform encephalopathy. In 2006, the European Union lifted a 10-year ban on the export of live cattle and cattle products (other than milk) from the UK. Control measures, including the slaughter of affected cows, cost the UK government an estimated \u00a33.5 billion sterling (about US$5 billion). The export ban cost the UK agricultural sector about \u00a3675 million a year.\u2022\nFoot and mouth disease. The costs of controlling an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK and continental Europe in 2001 \u2013 estimated at \u00a38.5 billion \u2013 dwarfed those of the BSE outbreak and devastated the centuries-old British livestock industry. Foot and mouth disease does not infect humans but can be spread by travelers who have contaminated soil on their shoes or clothing or who carry contaminated food products. The St Patrick's Day parade in Ireland was cancelled due to concerns about spreading the virus, and the British army was mobilized to help bury the carcasses of 7 million animals slaughtered because of potential exposure to the disease.In August 2007, the European Union imposed a temporary ban on export of livestock, meat and milk from the UK, and the UK halted the internal movement of farm animals nationwide, to minimize the risk of spreading foot and mouth disease after cases were detected in Surrey. The outbreak, which affected about eight farms, was traced to an accidental release of an experimental vaccine strain from a high-security animal laboratory in rural England.\n",

This is the operating principle behind PulseNet,18 a molecular subtyping network that has used the pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) technique to detect several major multistate food-borne outbreaks. For example, PulseNet was used to detect an outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 transmitted by fresh spinach sold in 26 states (in 2006) and an outbreak of Salmonella St Paul associated with jalapeno peppers sold in more than 40 states (in 2008). This technology is in use in many countries all over the world (http://www.pulsenetinternational.org). In the future, advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics may lead to the development of increasingly sophisticated typing methods that will facilitate discovery of novel disease risk factors for hundreds of pathogens and help health authorities identify linkages among geographically dispersed cases of disease. For example, the CDC has proposed the development of an international database called Microbe. Net that could potentially match a pathogen isolated from an ill person in one country with an environmental microbe isolated in another.",

Plague (which is both rodent-borne and vector-borne) was introduced into the USA in the early 1900s, via infected rats and fleas in ships that arrived at port cities. It quickly became established in the North American prairie ecosystem, infecting a wide range of animals, including native rodents and their fleas, which have been the most frequent sources of human infection.

Epidemiologic studies suggested that the H5N1 virus was transmitted from chickens to people and only poorly (if at all) from person to person. Nevertheless, it was feared that the virus might reassort with a human influenza virus during the winter influenza season, creating a virulent strain capable of air-borne human-to-human transmission. To ensure that the H5N1 virus would have no opportunity to evolve, the Hong Kong government authorized the culling of all 1.6 million chickens in Hong Kong (see Box 4.1). Six years later (in 2003) influenza A (H5N1) re-merged in poultry in South East Asia and then spread to Central Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, leading to a worldwide pandemic alert (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html).",
