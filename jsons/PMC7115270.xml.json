In 2005, reported campylobacter infections increased by 7.8% compared with the previous year, rising to an incidence rate of 51.6 cases per 100,000 people. The EFSA states that the source of most human campylobacter infections is related to fresh poultry meat. On the other hand, Salmonella infections fell by 9.5% in 2005 to an incidence of 38.2 cases per 100,000 (176,395 reported cases). The 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) report9 concluded that approximately 40% of reported foodborne outbreaks in the WHO European Region over the past decade were caused by food consumed in private homes. The report cites several factors as \u201ccritical for a large proportion of foodborne diseases\u201d including use of contaminated raw food ingredients, contact between raw and cooked foods, and poor personal hygiene by food handlers. United Kingdom data show that food poisoning notifications reached a peak in 1997-1998 and has since declined but remains in excess of 70,000 per year.10 In reality, the burden of food poisoning is much higher because most cases go unreported; according to the UK Food Standards Agency,11 the true number of cases is approximately 4.7 million per year.",

Several studies have demonstrated that colds are also a trigger for asthma.31 RSV is the major cause of viral RT infection in young children worldwide.

Adopting a holistic approach makes sense because all these issues are interdependent and based on the same underlying microbiologic principles. HACCP also forms the basis for developing an approach to home hygiene that can be adapted to meet differing needs. Indeed, it is only by adopting such a holistic approach that the causal link between hands and infection transmission in the home can be addressed properly because hand hygiene is a central component of all these issues.",

Risk assessment is then based on the frequency of occurrence of pathogenic contamination at that site, together with the probability of transfer from that site such that family members may be exposed. This means that, even if a particular environmental site is highly contaminated, unless there is a high probability of transfer from that site, the risk of infection transmission is low. From this, it is possible to determine the \u201ccritical control points\u201d for preventing spread of infection. The data suggest the following:\u2022For reservoir sites such as the sink waste pipes or toilets, although the probability of contamination (potentially pathogenic bacteria or viruses) is high, the risk of transfer is limited unless there is a particular risk situation (eg, a family member with enteric infection and fluid diarrhea, when toilet flushing can produce splashing or aerosol formation that can settle on contact surfaces around the toilet).58, 61\n\u2022By contrast, for reservoir sites such as wet cleaning cloths, not only is there high probability of significant contamination, but, by the very nature of their usage, they carry a high risk of disseminating contamination to other surfaces and to the hands.\u2022For hands and hand contact and food preparation surfaces, although the probability of contamination is, in relative terms, lower, it is still significant, for example, particularly following contact with contaminated food; people; pets; or other contaminated surfaces such as door, faucet, and toilet-flush handles. Because there is a constant risk of spread from these surfaces, hygiene measures are important for these surfaces.\u2022For other surfaces (floors, walls, furniture, and others), risks are mainly due to pathogens such as S aureus and C difficile, which survive under dry conditions. Because the risks of transfer and exposure are relatively low, these surfaces are considered low risk, but where there is known contamination, for example, soiling of floors by pets, crawling infants may be at risk. Cleaning can also recirculate dust-borne pathogens onto hand and food contact surfaces.\n",

However, although this is a useful \u201crule of thumb\u201d ranking, it is not a constant. For example, although risks from toilets, sinks, floors, and others relate mainly to the relatively lower risk of transfer from these sites to hands, hand and food contact surfaces, and cloths, this risk can increase substantially during occasions when an infected family member has fluid diarrhea or when a floor surface is contaminated with vomitus, urine, or feces.

The EFSA also reported that up to 66% of samples from fresh poultry were positive for campylobacter.77 In the United States, more than half of raw chicken is estimated to be contaminated with camplylobacter.76 Chapman et al78 showed that 0.4% to 0.8% of meat products purchased from UK butchers were positive for E coli O157. In a recent study in Canada, C difficile was isolated from 20% of 60 samples of retail ground meat purchased over a 10-month period, and 11 isolates were toxigenic.79\n",

Isolation rates were highest for hands, chopping boards, and cleaning cloths (25%, 35%, and 60%, respectively, of surfaces sampled).86\n\u2022In homes containing an infant recently vaccinated for polio (during which time shedding occurs in feces), virus was isolated from 13% of bathroom, living room, and kitchen surfaces.87 Most frequently contaminated were hand contact sites such as bathroom taps, door handles, toilet flushes, soap dispensers, nappy changing equipment, and potties.\u2022Following handshaking with a volunteer whose hands were contaminated from touching a virus-contaminated door handle, successive transmission from one person to another could be followed up to the sixth person.88\n\u2022Where fingers were contacted with norovirus-contaminated fecal material, the virus was consistently transferred via the fingers to melamine surfaces and from there to hand contact surfaces, such as taps, door handles, and telephone receivers. Contaminated fingers sequentially transferred the virus to up to 7 clean surfaces.89\n\u2022A study90 with FCV showed survival for up to 3 days on telephone buttons and receivers, for 1 or 2 days on computer mouse, and for 8 to 12 hours on keyboard keys and brass disks representing faucets and door handles. The time for 90% virus reduction was <4 hours on computer keys, mouse, and brass disks; 4 to 8 hours on telephone receivers; and 12 to 24 hours on telephone buttons.\u2022In homes of infants with recurrent C difficile infection, 12% of environmental surfaces were positive for C difficile, and 1 of 4 other household members carried C difficile in stool. In a control home with no household carriers, none of 84 environment samples were positive for C difficile.\n91\n\u2022In 4 out of 6 homes in which there was a Salmonella case, the causative species was isolated from fecal soiling under the flushing rim and scale material in the toilet bowl for up to 3 weeks after notification of infection.58 Flushing toilets seeded with Salmonella enteritidis resulted in contamination of hand contact surfaces such as toilet seats and toilet seat lids.\n",

Gillespie et al15 reported an evaluation of reported outbreaks linked to UK households for 1992 to 1999 that suggested, of the 85% of outbreaks designated as foodborne, cross contamination was implicated in 20% of outbreaks compared with 30% and 31% of outbreaks for which inadequate storage and cooking, respectively, were thought to be the cause. There were no data to suggest what percentage of cross contamination events involved the hands, and Gillespie et al15 expressed concern that most of the reported outbreaks were linked to home catering, thus not necessarily representative of normal daily routine. Aerosol transmission can result from settling on hand and food contact surfaces, but, for norovirus, infection can sometimes result from direct inhalation of infected particles of vomit by people immediately adjacent to the person who vomits. The potential for airborne transmission of norovirus was demonstrated in studies in a restaurant and a primary school, in which close proximity to infected persons in the immediate aftermath of a vomiting attack was identified as a risk factor.95, 96\n",

When illness occurred in the family, mothers were instructed to dip their fingers in iodine upon awakening in the morning, then every 3 or 4 hours or after activities that washed the iodine from the skin. The secondary attack rate in mothers was 7% in the iodine group and 20% in placebo families. No infections occurred in mothers after 11 exposures to an infected index case in the iodine group, compared with 5 infections after 16 exposures in the placebo group.\u2022Hall et al showed that infected infants excrete prodigious amounts of RSV in their nasal secretions for several days105 and that RSV could be recovered from hands that had touched surfaces contaminated with secretions from infected infants.99 Hall and Douglas found that close contact with symptomatic infants who were producing abundant secretions, or their immediate environment, was necessary for infection.106\n\n",

Contamination of hands can occur by handshaking or touching contaminated surfaces. Pathogens shed into the environment from these sources can survive for significant periods and are readily spread around the home to and from the hands and via handkerchiefs and tissues, tap and door handles, telephones, or other hand contact surfaces:\u2022Gwaltney and Hendley demonstrated that most subjects with experimental colds had rhinovirus on their hands and that virus could be recovered from 43% of plastic tiles they touched.104 For people with rhinovirus colds, virus was found on 39% of hands and 6% of objects in their immediate environment.100 Reed demonstrated recovery of virus from naturally contaminated objects in the surroundings of persons with rhinovirus colds.102\n\u2022In a recent study, Winther et al111 recruited volunteers suffering from colds to stay overnight in hotel rooms. After checkout, but before room cleaning, 10 objects identified as frequently touched were sampled for rhinovirus. Virus was found on 35% of objects, including door handles, light switches, pens, faucet and toilet handles, and television remote controls. Some people contaminated none or few sites, most contaminated several, and some contaminated almost all (up to 8) sites. In a second study in which the same subjects stayed overnight in a hotel room in which hand contact surfaces (light switch phone button and handset) had been contaminated with rhinovirus-contaminated mucus, 60% of subjects became contaminated with rhinovirus.\u2022Ansari et al showed that hands readily pick up rhinovirus and PIV by touching contaminated objects.112 As much as 70% of infectious rhinovirus has been shown to transfer to a recipient's fingers after contact for 10 seconds.113 In a study with volunteers who handled contaminated doorknobs or faucets, recovery rates from 3 to 1800 plaque-forming units of rhinovirus were obtained from fingertips.114\n\u2022In a study of US day care centers and domestic homes, influenza A virus was detected on 23% of day care center surfaces sampled during the fall of 2003 and 53% of surfaces sampled during the spring. Although no influenza was detected on home surfaces during the summer, influenza was detected on 59% of surfaces sampled during March in 5 homes in which there was an influenza-infected child. No virus was recovered from 3 other homes in which all household members were healthy. Influenza virus was recovered most frequently from telephone receivers (80%) and least frequently from computer keyboards (40%). Other surfaces found to be contaminated included refrigerators; kitchen faucets; light switches; microwaves; TV remote controls; doorknobs; and bath, faucet, and toilet handles.

Data suggest that, to some extent, airborne droplets and droplet nuclei cause infection as a result of settling on hand contact surfaces. The frequent occurrence of diarrhea and the detection of viral RNA in fecal samples tested suggest that the H5N1 influenza virus may replicate in the human gut and could be a source of transmission via hands and surfaces.125 At present, however, it is thought that this is unlikely. The growing evidence base related to the survival, transmission, and human exposure to RT viruses via hands and other surfaces is also reviewed elsewhere.32, 35, 37, 82, 94, 99\n",

Exposure can produce colonization and/or infection that usually occurs in areas in which there are cuts, abrasions, and others that damage the integrity of the skin. Where there are predisposing factors, the numbers of organisms required to produce infection may be relatively small. Marples126 showed that up to 106 cells may be required to produce pus in healthy skin, but as little as 102 may be sufficient in areas in which the skin is occluded or traumatized. Risks associated with exposure to HCA-MRSA and CA-MRSA are different. HCA-MRSA usually affects elderly adults and those who are immunocompromised, particularly those with surgical or other wounds or who have indwelling catheters. For CA-MRSA, those at particular risk appear to be younger, generally healthy people who practice contact sports or other activities that put them at higher risk of acquiring skin cuts and abrasions.127 US experience suggests that CA-MRSA may be more virulent than other strains and is easily transmissible within households and community settings (eg, schools, day care centers, sport teams) in which skin-to-skin contact or sharing of contaminated items (eg, towels, sheets and sport equipment) are vehicles for person-to-person transmission.128 A case-control study129 involving 55 cases of MRSA in a US prison showed that inmates who washed their hands \u22646 times per day had an increased risk for MRSA infection compared with inmates who washed their hands >12 times per day.",

From a total of 9622 participants, it was found that 31.6% were colonized with S aureus, of which 2.5% were colonized with MRSA. Of persons with MRSA, half were identified as strains containing the SCCmec type IV gene (most usually associated with CA-MRSA), whereas the other half were identified as strains containing the SCCmec type II gene (most usually associated with HCA-MRSA). Several other investigators have examined the epidemiology of MRSA in the US community; differences in the data suggest a sporadic distribution of CA-MRSA, with carriage rates ranging from 8% to 20% in Baltimore, Atlanta, and Minnesota127 up to 28% to 35% for an apparently healthy population in New York.134\n",

Intervention studies on the other hand compare infection rates in groups in which handwashing is, or is not, promoted. Intervention studies employing randomization of treatment groups have been considered the \u201cgold-standard\u201d in terms of reducing selection biases. These studies have the ability to ensure that randomized groups are similar, apart from treatment allocation and differences that occur by chance.

For the most part, these studies have been carried out in child day care centers, schools, and military and other public settings in which the outcome is often measured against a high baseline level of infection. Relatively few studies have been carried out in household settings in the United States and Europe. Difficulties associated with studying households in developed areas include fewer children under the age of 5 years, higher level of hygiene infrastructure, and difficulties in collecting data. Given that there are likely fewer susceptible individuals clustered within household settings, the prevalence of GI and RT illnesses is relatively much lower, making it more difficult to detect a significant influence of hand hygiene on the occurrence of illness.",

Studies that are included have been selected on the basis of whether transmission routes are likely to reflect those in the home, most particularly whether the relative rates of transmission via these routes (as shown in Fig 2) are likely to be similar. For this reason, studies on GI infection in developing countries have been excluded; in these settings, limited access to sanitation means that rates of direct hand-to-mouth transmission from feces is high relative to other routes of transmission (eg, person-to-person transmission via hands, or inadequate food hygiene), compared to settings with adequate water and sanitation in which transmission is more likely to involve person-to-person transmission and transmission via food, rather than direct feces-to-hand-to-mouth. For GI illnesses, we have, therefore, focused on studies carried out in developed country communities, although, even for studies such as those in child daycare centers, in which food preparation is not undertaken by study participants, the data probably reflect mainly the impact on person-to-person transmission. For RT infections, studies conducted in both developed and developing countries are included on the basis that relative rates of airborne transmission versus transmission via hands are likely to be similar regardless of setting.",

Surprisingly, 40% of the 11 studies in Table 7, Table 8 did not randomize. In some studies, randomization may not be an option (eg, in community settings) because the intervention is too complicated to randomize to multiple groups rather than assigning it to a single geographic area. Controlling for potential confounding variables is also an important issue, for example, if a study did not control for age and included adults as well as children, the effect of a hygiene intervention may be diluted because adults are at lower risk for diarrheal disease compared with children. In randomized studies, adjustment for confounding in the statistical analysis may not be required if potential confounders associated with intervention and control groups appear balanced, for example, randomization of households in the same geographic area may produce intervention and control arms with the same age distributions, hygiene habits, and health profiles. As summarized in\nTable 9, of the 11 studies, only 50% (9/18) reported controlling for at least 1 potential confounding factor. Although masking (also known as blinding) can be difficult to implement in hygiene studies because subjects, observers, and interviewers are usually aware of the intervention status, a few studies (2/18) were able to employ masking to reduce knowledge of the intervention. Masking can reduce biases associated with knowledge of intervention, including changes in behaviors, practices, and data collection methods.",

Clustered interventions must take into account the grouped data structure in subsequent analyses or must analyze data at the same level at which it was collected. If the group or cluster is not controlled for, through specialized techniques such as generalized estimating equations, or analyzed at the group unit of measurement (average classroom illness rate), the investigator risks making a type I error (eg, falsely concluding that the effect of the intervention is significant, when there is no significant difference). Although most handwashing studies employ clustered data structures, use of clustered data statistical techniques have only become more prevalent since 2000.",

In some cases, organisms can be attached to the hands too firmly and may not be removed by handwashing. A study of the spread of Salmonella and campylobacter from contaminated chickens via hands during handling and preparation in a kitchen176 showed that, although campylobacter were efficiently released from the hands by a 30-second rub and rinse process, a 2-minute process was necessary to eliminate Salmonella. The hand rinsing process is also important; Cogan et al86 showed that, following preparation of Salmonella and campylobacter-contaminated chickens in domestic kitchens, 15.3% of hands and hand and food contact surfaces still showed evidence of contamination even after participants had carried out a washing-up routine with detergent and hot water and then used a cloth to wipe surfaces. Sites contaminated most frequently were hands (20%); dishcloths, utensils, and tap handles (25%); and sink surrounds (30%). These results were confirmed in further studies176, 177 in which, after cleaning up with a typical routine involving a bowl of hot soapy water and a cloth, although isolation rates from hands of participants were 5% (1/20) for campylobacter, 45% (9/20) of participants still had Salmonella on their hands, and, on 3 occasions, counts recovered were >103 colony-forming units. In a further study in which participants cleaned up in the same way but then rinsed their hands under running water for 10 seconds, no samples were positive for campylobacter. However, 15% (3/20) still had low numbers of Salmonella isolated from their hands. Larson et al showed that the quantity of soap (1 mL and 3 mL) used can also have an impact on the microbial reduction achieved by handwashing.178\n",

That having been said, the data suggest that, although nonenveloped viruses such as HAV and enteroviruses (eg, poliovirus) require 70% to 80% alcohol to be reliably inactivated, studies by Sattar et al194 suggest that 60% ethanol was sufficient to reduce the titers of rotavirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus by >3 log within a 10-second contact period. Data indicate that FCV may also be relatively susceptible to alcohols compared with other nonenveloped viruses, although sensitivity depends on the type and concentration of alcohol. Using an in vivo test based on the ASTM 1838-02 method, Gehrke et al190 showed that 70% ethanol was the most effective agent against FCV with a log reduction of 3.78 compared with 70% 1-propanol (log reduction, 3.58) and 70% 2-propanol (log reduction, 2.15) (exposure time 30 seconds). However, a more recent study by Kampf et al191 suggested a log reduction after 30 seconds of only 2.66 and 1.53 for 70% ethanol and 70% 1-propanol, respectively.",

Although intervention studies yield quantitative data on health impact, as discussed in section 4.2, the reliability of these estimates is difficult to confirm. By contrast, in vivo and in vitro tests are more economic to perform and can be used to determine relative efficacy of different procedures but give no assessment of how the contamination reduction on hands correlates with health impact. In an attempt to overcome these problems, Haas et al have applied the technique of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) to estimate the relative health benefits resulting from use of different hygiene procedures.204 This approach involves using microbiologic data from the published literature related to each stage of the infection transmission cycle to calculate infection risk.",

Pathogenic E coli and E coli O157:H7 were selected for this study because it is known from other investigations206 that handling ground beef during home food preparation poses a risk of infection with E coli. To perform the risk assessment, data on the density of pathogens in ground beef, transference from beef to hands, removal by handwashing or ABHS, rate of transfer from hand to mouth, and infectivity of ingested pathogens were obtained from the literature and, after screening for data quality, were used to develop probability distributions. For assessing log reductions produced by hand hygiene procedures, only in vivo panel testing data were considered.

The probability that an individual will engage in such behavior is not known, and, therefore, a direct comparison with actual disease rates cannot be made. However, with some plausible assumptions, it was assessed that, assuming that there are 100 million individuals in the United States, each of whom handles ground beef once per month, this results in 1.2 \u00d7 109 contacts per year. Assuming that 10% of these individuals contact hand to mouth after handling ground beef, this amounts to 1.2 \u00d7 108 incidents per year. For E coli O157:H7, using the median risk, this would result in an estimate ranging from 0.014 infections per year if all individuals washed their hands with soap following contact with ground beef to 0.7 infections per year if no handwashing is done. This would equate to a 98% median risk reduction for handwashing compared with no handwashing. If an ABHS was used, this would result in an estimate of 0.00005 infections per year if all individuals used ABHS following contact with ground beef.

Promotion of ABHS in this manner also produced some reduction in the incidence of RT infections, which was less than that associated with promotion of handwashing alone. Assessing whether there might be an added health benefit of using ABHS above and beyond the effect of hygiene education is hampered by the fact that most studies used hygiene education and ABHS in the intervention arm but did not provide an educational component to the control arm.",

The studies also excluded participants who reported current ABHS use in the home. Furthermore, participants were asked to refrain from using ABHS in settings outside the home. These are all important design strategies minimizing bias associated with noncompliance or differential usage. Two of the 8 intervention studies failed to use systematic monitoring for hygiene practices, such as frequency of hand-sanitizing episodes, frequency of handwashing, or duration of handwashing.212, 213 This is especially concerning because the study by Sandora et al suggests that the quantity of ABHS influences the risk of infection in a dose-response manner.215 Moreover, if frequency of handwashing and ABHS use is not recorded, it is impossible to isolate the independent effects of ABHS from that of handwashing on infection rates. In these studies of ABHS use, surveillance measures included calculating use from monthly demand, total amount supplied, observation by research assistants, participant report, and reported use by primary caregivers in households.186, 209, 212, 214, 215\n",

At present, there is a paucity of data on the efficacy of handwashing in relation to how people actually wash their hands on a day-to-day basis, both in the duration of handwashing and handwashing technique; in most of the intervention studies described earlier no attempt was made to time handwashes or to determine residual levels of contamination on the hands after handwashing. Microbiologic data suggest that, for some pathogens (eg, Salmonella), mechanical removal by handwashing alone is inefficient. These data, together with the results of in vivo panel testing of the effectiveness of handwashing and of ABHS, as described above, question the efficacy of handwashing in community-based groups and suggest that more work is needed to determine the efficacy of hand hygiene procedures under conditions normally encountered in the home and how hand hygiene procedures could be improved.",

It is possible, however, that the potential for increased benefits against bacterial infections compared with handwashing may be offset by reduced efficacy against important nonenveloped viruses such as rotavirus, some strains of rhinovirus, and possibly also norovirus. It has been argued that the higher impact of ABHS interventions against GI compared with RT infections is due to the fact that RT infections are predominantly viral. However, because the intervention data indicate that handwashing also supports a stronger reduction in GI diseases compared with RT diseases, this seems unlikely. Some studies suggest that, to achieve satisfactory activity that includes all types of viruses, higher concentrations up to 80% ethanol should be advised. Other studies suggest that the efficacy of ABHS may be increased by increasing the volume of agent applied to the hands.215\n",

The QMRA approach, as outlined earlier in this review, however, demonstrates that strategies that produce an increase in the log reduction on hands from 2 to 3 to 4 are accompanied by a significant incremental reduction in the risk of infection in a given population and could thus be worthwhile. This suggests that the health impact from promoting hand hygiene could be increased by developing and promoting procedures for use in the home and community that increase the log reduction of contamination on the hands. This involves identifying products and procedures (both soap-based and waterless products or wipes) that achieve high levels of removal and/or \u201ckill\u201d (alone or in combination) of the full range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and enveloped and nonenveloped viruses and that deliver hand hygiene under conditions that people are prepared to employ in their busy and mobile daily lives.

This may be one of the factors responsible for the higher risk reductions observed in intervention studies of GI compared with RT infections. For example, knowledge regarding the need for handwashing after coughing or sneezing may not be as pervasive as knowledge about handwashing after defecation, and it may be that people understand better when to wash their hands during food-associated activities but not, for example, while handling contaminated tissues. Although some intervention studies described in this review involved a component of education, it was not possible to determine the extent to which hygiene education that enhanced people's understanding of infection transmission also enhanced health outcome.",

Whereas risks associated with food handling are largely confined to defined periods of time, for RT and skin infections (and person-to-person transmission of GI infection), the risk is ongoing and involves a large proportion of our ongoing daily activities.

This suggests that, in situations in the home and community that are \u201cstandard risk\u201d (perhaps better described as situations not specifically regarded as \u201chigh risk\u201d), either handwashing or use of ABHS may be chosen. Within this, however, there are factors that advise, or in some cases dictate, choice, for example, handwashing is only an option when there is access to soap and water, whereas use of ABHS is not an option when hands are heavily soiled (although people are likely to choose handwashing in this situation, prompted by the need to \u201cclean\u201d their hands). As discussed previously, there will always be situations in the home in which there is increased risk, either because there is a known source of infection or someone who is at increased risk of becoming infected. These situations are summarized in\nTable 20. These situations may relate to activities that are carried out routinely in the home, such as handling of raw meat and poultry, or involve household members such as pregnant women or young babies who are otherwise healthy but at increased risk of (or from) infection.

Although much of the \u201chealth care\u201d carried out at home is done by trained caregivers, increasingly, there are situations in the home in which simple but risky actions are carried out by household members. In all of these \u201cincreased risk\u201d situations, as outlined in Table 20, it is suggested that handwashing followed by use of an ABHS should be encouraged.",

A key benefit of ABHS is that they offer the means to apply hand hygiene in situations in which there is limited or no access to a soap and water. In home care situations, ABHS offer an alternative to handwashing in situations in which other pressures mitigate against finding the time to visit the bathroom for handwashing, for example, when caring for a baby in the nursery or a sick person. They also offer a substitute for handwashing in \u201cout of home\u201d settings such as offices and public places, such as public transport or animal exhibits, at which access to soap and water is a particular problem and all of which offer frequent opportunities for hand transmission of infection. Promoting use of ABHS has the potential to get people to undertake hand hygiene more frequently and at critical times. In response to concerns about the possibility of a flu pandemic, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the use of ABHS for use as an alternative to handwashing.218 In the event of a flu pandemic, it seems particularly important to encourage people to adopt good hand hygiene in public places. In health care settings, links between use of ABHS and increased hand hygiene compliance and reduced infection rates has been observed.219 In applying the framework outlined in Fig 4, our intention is that this should not be regarded as an \u201ceither handwashing or ABHS\u201d situation; the fundamental aim should be to encourage more people to undertake hand hygiene procedures wherever possible at critical times.",

Because people are reluctant to comply with handwashing, together with the microbiologic data showing the potential for transfer via hand and food contact surfaces and cloths to hands, which increase as the frequency occurrence of contamination of these surfaces increases, it would seem that, to maximize the health impact from hand hygiene promotion, it should be combined with promotion of hygiene in general, including hygienic cleaning of critical surfaces. If nothing else, this could raise awareness that hand contamination can arise from touching apparently clean surfaces. We are concerned that emphasis on handwashing alone without putting it within the context of other aspects of hygiene is encouraging the perception that handwashing is all that is required, ie, \u201cif you wash your hands you won't get sick.\u201d",

Provision of detailed guidelines for hand hygiene is outside the scope of this review. For such guidelines the reader is referred to the IFH guidelines and training resource on home hygiene. As part of its work in promoting home hygiene, the IFH has produced \u201cGuidelines for Prevention of Infection and Cross Infection in the Domestic Environment\u201d and \u201cRecommendations for Selection of Suitable Hygiene Procedures for Use in the Domestic Environment.\u201d220, 221 These documents are based on the concept of a risk-based approach and give detailed guidance on hand hygiene in the context of all aspects of home hygiene including food hygiene, general hygiene, personal hygiene, care of pets, and others. Most recently, the IFH has also produced a teaching/self-learning resource on home hygiene.222 This is based on the IFH Guidelines and Recommendations but is designed to present home hygiene theory and practice in simple practical language that can be understood by those with relative little infection control training or background.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases circulating in the community remain a significant concern, both in developed and developing countries. The global burden of ID accounts for over 13 million deaths annually but, whereas the majority of deaths occurs in the developing world, infection also causes approximately 4% of deaths in developed countries.223 Although mortality from ID has declined in the developed world, trends in morbidity suggest a change in the pattern of ID rather than declining rates. Several demographic, environmental, and health care trends, as reviewed in this report, are combining to make it likely that the threat of ID will increase in coming years, rather than decline. One such factor is the rising proportion of the population in the community who are more vulnerable to infection. An important part of current European and US health policy is commitment to shorter hospital stays. A key requirement is to ensure that the increased health provision at home is not accompanied by an increase in ID risks; otherwise, the cost savings gained by care in the community are likely to be overridden by costs of rehospitalization. Even for the \u201chealthy community,\u201d ID represents a significant economic burden because of absence from work and school and added health care costs. Secondary infections can produce complications, and some infections may be associated with the development of diseases such as cancer or other chronic conditions, which can manifest at a later date. Those responsible for ensuring that the public are protected from infection in health care facilities are now realizing that their ability to manage the problem is hampered by spread of pathogens such as MRSA, C difficile, and norovirus in the community and the home, and the number of infected people or carriers who come into their facilities, and are looking for ways to address this by engaging the public to adopt more rigorous standards of hygiene.",

The health impact of hand hygiene within a given community can be increased by using products and procedures, either alone or in sequence, that maximize the log reduction of both bacteria and viruses on hands.\u2022The impact of hand hygiene in reducing ID risks could be increased by convincing people to apply hand hygiene procedures correctly (eg, wash their hands correctly) and at the correct time.\u2022To optimize health benefits, promotion of hand hygiene must be accompanied by hygiene education and should also involve promotion of other aspects of hygiene, for example, surface and cloth hygiene.\n",

This includes the following: (1) in vivo panel tests to determine the reduction in bacteria and viruses on hands under controlled conditions. Committee European Normalisation or ASTM tests now provide standard test models for comparing the efficacy of handwashing with the use of waterless hand sanitizer products, under defined conditions. They provide an economic approach (relative to intervention studies) that can be used, alone or in combination with QMRA, to inform hygiene policy and/or the design of intervention studies. (2) Field studies to determine log reduction in counts on hands in relation to how people actually wash their hands or apply ABHS in their homes.\u2022Additional data are needed to understand how, when, and why people practice hand hygiene at home and how this relates to their understanding of ID transmission and risks.\u2022Intervention studies are needed to determine the health impact of hand hygiene promotion with hygiene education, compared with hygiene promotion without education. This should also include understanding how hand hygiene combines with surface hygiene to influence health outcome.\u2022Intervention studies are needed to determine the potential for an increase in health impact from promoting use of ABHS in conjunction with handwashing (ie, handwashing followed by use of ABHS) or as a supplement to handwashing (in situations in which access to water is limited), compared with the promotion of handwashing alone.\n",
