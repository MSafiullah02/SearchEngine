An alternative is to board these admitted patients in the hallways of inpatient wards. We performed a survey to determine patients\u2019 preferences in the matter.",

There were 477 visitors, 532 patients waiting to be seen who did not have a disposition, and 213 patients being boarded. The age and gender compositions of the patient population are shown in Figure 1. A racial, gender, and age description of the entire sample, including visitors, is shown in Figure 2. Those patients actually being boarded split fairly evenly as to preferred location for boarding. Patients waiting to be seen and visitors showed progressively decreasing tolerance for ED boarding. A similar trend was noted for subjects\u2019 opinions of a reasonable wait time to be moved to an inpatient bed from the ED (Table 1). Combining all three groups, 801 (65.5%; 95% CI 62.8%\u201368.2%) stated a preference for being boarded in the hallway of an inpatient ward rather than in the ED, 406 (33.2%; 95% CI 30.6%\u201335.9%) would choose the ED, and 15 (1%; 95% CI 0.7%\u20132.0%) had no preference. There were no significant differences when evaluated by gender, season, or between daytime and nighttime participants. The commonly cited reasons among boarded patients for preferring inpatient ward boarding were privacy concerns and reduced noise levels (n = 32, n = 36). The most common reasons for preferring ED boarding are easy access to a doctor and the excitement of watching the care of other patients (n = 30, n = 5). An appropriate denominator for these reasons is difficult to select as most patient comments reflected frustration at waiting times rather than specific reasons for their preference for ED or ward boarding.",

However, among the patients most directly affected, those actually boarding, almost half (44.6%) would choose ED over ward boarding. This result surprised us. Although the advantage of a simple survey tool such as ours is that it provides a simple answer, it cannot answer in depth questions as to why patients hold the preferences that they do. Is it possible that actually being an ED boarder is less horrid than imagining being one? That visitors were less tolerant of it than patients suggests this may be the case. ED staff do attempt to make boarders\u2019 stays as bearable as possible, often leaving them in an examination cubicle with family members without regard to visiting hours imposed elsewhere in the hospital. Additionally, experienced patients may well value being able to gain access to a physician easily, as is the case in the ED. Although disruptive to patient flow, and creating the potential for disharmony between Emergency Physicians and the admitting services responsible for the boarded patients, ease of physician access was valued by many of our patients who stated a preference for ED boarding. As we did not anticipate these results, we had not designed our survey tool to probe these questions.",

If one were to seek the input of interested members of the general public, then where better to look than those whose family or friends are currently ED patients? They are a heterogeneous group and we did not attempt to distinguish subgroups such as former patients within this group. From a business standpoint, visitors\u2019 opinions are important because the potential for negative \u201cword of mouth\u201d publicity for the hospital is in part related to the numbers of people recounting their experiences.
