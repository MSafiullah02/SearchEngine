            "text": "This form of pneumonia is the most common form seen in BRD of young dairy calves and most often associated with P multocida infection, although other respiratory bacteria may also produce the lesion.3, 4, 13 Suppurative bronchopneumonia occurs when bronchial colonization of moderately virulent bacteria initiates a suppurative bronchitis with progressive spread along airways resulting in an obviously bronchiole-centered lesion within each lung lobule. The pneumonia is bilateral, cranioventrally distributed, and moderately firm (Fig. 1\n). In acute lesions, affected lobes are fairly uniform in color varying from pink, pink-gray, dark red, red-gray, or gray with minimal to mild interlobular septal edema (Fig. 2\n). Pleuritis is usually not present; however, if present, it consists of small foci of pleural dullness to small clusters of fibrin strands. On cut surface within lobules, there are variable-sized, partially discreet tan to gray foci indicative of a pattern of bronchiolar and peribronchiolar inflammation (Fig. 3\n). Remaining areas of lobules are pink to dark red representing various amounts of inflammation, congestion, and atelectasis. Intrabronchial purulent to mucopurulent exudate may be grossly obvious or in more subtle cases require a gentle squeeze to express exudate.",

Consolidated lobes have a marbled appearance, a descriptive term indicating that each lobule is reasonably uniform in color with a multicolor patchwork or marbled pattern of lobules ranging from pink, pink-tan, dark red, to red-gray (Fig. 5\n). Large, irregular foci of pink-tan coagulation necrosis are frequently within lobules and may involve entire lobules.

As in AIP of pastured cattle, a role for 3MI has been examined. In the feedlot disease, 3MI has been generally discounted because of the sporadic nature of the disease and lack of association with dietary change. In one feedlot study, however, blood levels of a 3MI metabolite were significantly higher in AIP than in control cattle suggesting a potential pathogenic role for 3MI.54 Interstitial pneumonia also was described with some frequency in feedlot heifers fed melengestrol acetate to suppress estrus.55 Several studies have investigated the association of BRSV and interstitial pneumonia with conflicting results; however, this may be because attempts to culture or demonstrate viral antigen is done using postmortem-collected specimens, and negative results may not accurately account for the virus' role in pathogenesis.51, 54, 56, 57 Lesions of small airway disease, such as bronchiolar necrosis and, more commonly, its healing stage, bronchiolitis obliterans, are frequently found histologically in feedlot cases of interstitial pneumonia.4, 6, 57 It was suggested that feedlot interstitial pneumonia might result from the effects of increased proinflammatory cytokines within lungs due to chronic bronchiolar disease, and endotoxin from gram-negative respiratory infections may contribute alveolar and bronchiolar damage leading to interstitial pneumonia.52\n",

In the field, bronchointerstitial pneumonia is often complicated with secondary bacterial infection, which obscures and overshadows the primary viral lesion. Therefore, cases of true bronchointerstitial pneumonia are only occasionally recognized.

Pail- or bottle-fed calves, intubation and balling gun accidents, traumatic pharyngitis, rumenitis from ingesta of oilfield fluids, and prolonged recumbency have all been implicated in causing aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration of rumen contents is, by far, the most common cause of aspiration pneumonia of cattle. The resulting lesions are often unilateral, necrotizing to gangrenous, and predominantly cranioventral (Figs. 14 and 15\n). Another diagnostically useful feature of distribution exists when the pneumonic lesion is not only unilateral but also caudally situated without cranial lung involvement. Fibrinopurulent to suppurative pleuritis is commonly present and covers the necrotic foci; empyema may result from ruptured foci.58 Pneumonic lesions are brown to green and may be hemorrhagic, often forming cystic cavities exuding malodorous brown fluid that may contain ingesta. Putrid odors are especially prevalent in the presence of aspirated rumen anaerobic bacteria. Foreign material may be readily visible within the airways, but terminal aspiration of rumen contents must not be mistaken for a lesion of aspiration pneumonia. If the inciting material is lipid-rich, lipid droplets are visible floating on bronchoalveolar fluids.",

Embolic pneumonia is preceded by bacterial infection and suppuration at another location, which in cattle is most commonly liver, but other loci may occur, such as traumatic reticulopericarditis, mastitis, endometritis, and jugular thrombophlebitis. Extension of infection into local veins causes thrombophlebitis, pulmonary thromboembolism, and disseminated foci of pulmonary inflammation. Right-side vegetative endocarditis may also be present. Hepatic abscesses, often caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, may erode hepatic veins or caudal vena cava resulting in embolic showering of the lung. The earliest lesions are small foci of acute inflammation and necrosis that may progress to small- to moderate-sized abscesses of liquefactive to caseous necrosis. Lungs are usually edematous and perhaps emphysematous. Infected emboli may erode pulmonary artery branches causing pulmonary hemorrhage and leakage of free blood into major airways. With respiratory movements, redistribution of blood into small airways and alveoli occurs. Hemoptysis may also be present. In those cases, free blood is present in major airways, and on cut surface, aspirated blood is distributed in the lungs as feathery, lacy-appearing, red areas, which are particularly obvious within subpleural lobules (Fig. 17\n). In contrast to aspirated free blood, intrapulmonary hemorrhage associated with trauma, septicemia, or endotoxemia appears as dark red petechia or ecchymoses that are discretely demarcated and might be more randomly distributed than are areas of aspirated blood.",

The classical lesion of tuberculosis is the tubercle. Tubercles are usually circumscribed, often encapsulated, 1- to 40-mm granulomatous foci containing white to pale yellow caseous necrosis with or without foci of mineralization.4 Liquefaction may develop in some older lesions.68 At necropsy, lesions may not be obvious even in an animal that reacted positively on a tuberculin skin test. Careful examination of lymph nodes, in particular retropharyngeal, bronchial, and mediastinal, may demonstrate granulomatous inflammation and tubercle formation. Lung lesions are present in approximately 10% to 20% of the cases. In rare generalized cases, small disseminated caseous to caseocalcareous tubercles are present throughout the lungs. More commonly, solitary or clusters of tubercles are present, particularly in the caudal lung lobe. Liquefaction may occur in large lesions and could be misinterpreted as an abscess due to A pyogenes. Tuberculous lymphadenitis and pneumonia must be differentiated from mycotic lymphadenitis and granulomatous pneumonia, which is sometimes seen in slaughtered cattle.72 Mycotic pneumonia is relatively rare in cattle but can occur due to Coccidioides immitis, Aspergillus spp, H capsulatum, and other opportunistic fungi.73\n",
