Consequently, the novel coronavirus 2 was officially named SARS-CoV-2. 3 The COVID-19 epidemic in China and beyond was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the WHO. 1 As it continues to spread, virtually every healthcare personnel is likely to encounter a patient with COVID-19. Nuclear medicine physicians (NMPs) reported on cases of C-19AP identified on PET/CT examinations. 4, 5 It is the localizing CT that may suggest this diagnosis, which should place a patient under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. Therefore, SPECT/CT or PET/CT could lead to incidental findings of C-19AP necessitating management of a PUI.",

She had dyspnea of several days duration that started to improve a few days before the bone scan. When she arrived at our registration desk, she continued to experience an occasional dry cough and generalized mild weakness. The medical office associate at the registration desk asked the screening questions provided by our hospital administration, which at that time included (1) travel to specific countries with a high prevalence of COVID-19, (2) upper respiratory illness in the past 14 days, and (3) a fever.

The testing kits for SARS-CoV-2 were rationed at the time because of severe shortage, allowing testing of only symptomatic patients with a positive history of travel to high-risk countries or a contact with someone who did. Hence, our patient did not qualify for SARS-CoV-2 testing but was managed as a PUI based on incidental CT findings. Six days later, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. 1 The following day, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases stated at the House of Representatives hearing that \"The system is not really geared to what we need right now,\" when asked about SARS-CoV-2 test kits availability in the United States. 6 The test used for identification of SARS-CoV-2 is a real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity for such testing improved in the following order of sampling: bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (93%), sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%), fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy (46%), pharyngeal swabs (32%), feces (29%), and blood (1%). 7 The chest CT has a high diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19 infection, but it is not as specific as the molecular testing. All viral pneumonias have overlapping findings on a chest CT. 8 Shown are axial slices of localizing low-dose CT obtained with a non-breathholding technique as part of SPECT/CT study that revealed findings commonly described in patients with C-19AP. A, The localizing, unenhanced, axial CT image is shown. Respiratory motion artifact is creating double shadows (black arrowheads) and blurring the fine detail. Nevertheless, multiple scattered areas of GGOs are noted in the peripheral distribution (white arrows), a few of which in the left lung demonstrate nodular consolidation. B, The same image was processed using the edge enhancement filter, which improved visualization of associated interlobular and intralobular septal thickening (black arrow) with central lobular sparing (asterisk). A semilunar-shaped reticular-nodular infiltrate (white arrows) is surrounding a GGO (white indented-base arrowheads), called a reversed halo sign. There is a noticeable vascular enlargement coursing through a GGO (white flat-base arrowheads). C, Another slice showing peripheral GGO containing vascular enlargement. D, A slice showing reticular-nodular opacity (white arrow) with an air-bronchogram (black arrows).",

Our index patient was handled according to the contemporaneous institutional policy. It is important to be up-to-date on the policies issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 9 It is also important to monitor useful resources emerging from related specialty organizations. 10 The localizing low-dose CT performed as part of a SPECT/ CT examination is suboptimal but diagnostic. Its shortcomings include tidal breathing that creates motion artifact and hypoinflation. However, quality of localizing low-dose CT ( Fig. 2A) can be improved by edge enhancement, which is standard with most radiology image display workstations. It is common at our facility to apply edge enhancement that significantly improved image quality (Figs. 2B-D). Knowledge of typical CT features of C-19AP 2,11,12 by NMPs is essential in timely recognition of PUIs. In most states, PUIs must be reported to the Departments of Health. Therefore, every institution has to clearly chart the pathway for completing this requirement and associated responsibilities (Fig. 3) .",

A semilunar-shaped reticular-nodular infiltrate (white arrows) is surrounding a GGO (white indented-base arrowheads), called a reversed halo sign.
