At the field level we have such measures as self-assessed health status, report of a specific disease, record of a particular death, or an individual\u2019s test on a biomarker, such as blood pressure or serum cholesterol. The observations for individuals are combined and summarized to represent subnational geographic areas, demographic or socioeconomic groups within countries, or national populations. The summary measures, whether they are percentages, averages, or rates, apply to groups. A problem arises when the measures that are based on groups are assumed to represent individuals. The analysis becomes especially problematic when the units analyzed are geographic areas and inferences are being made about individuals from the analysis for these geographic areas.",

A population described by health-status variables then tends to be characterized by varying degrees of health inequality.

The basic methods of measuring inequality of the health status of groups within countries are generally the same as the methods used to measure health inequality among whole countries and world regions.",

            "text": "Some simpler measures of health inequality describe single populations independently, which may then be compared with the results of the same group measure for other populations; or are designed to link two populations directly in the computation of the measure. Another group of more complex measures of health inequality links health status or health events with the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of persons such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, and income class, and seeks to describe the extent of the association and even the causal relation between health status and these characteristics. Most measures of health inequality were developed in order to analyze differences in health status for such socioeconomic subgroups in national populations. The first group of measures, extended to include age, is described in the present chapter, and the second group of measures is described in 10.1007/978-94-007-1315-4_7. It is important to distinguish between measures of inequality in the distribution of a health measure, such as among ages, geographic areas, and general population groups, and measures of the differences in a health measure among various socioeconomic groups in a population for the purpose of determining the degree of causation between them. The latter may involve not only different measures but also causal inferences, value judgments, and differences in interpretation. While most recent research has focused on variations in the health status of socioeconomic groups within countries, in the discussion that follows in this chapter, I focus mainly on variations in health status among countries and among general populations. As is usual in demographic or epidemiological analysis, the conclusions drawn about variations and trends in health inequality among populations may differ depending on the measure used.",

After such scaling, the total, mean, or median of each distribution is reduced to a value of one. The same parameter, i.e., total, mean, or median, must be used for each distribution being compared. An alternative method is to multiply the elements of each distribution by the ratio of the mean or median of one of the distributions (\u201cthe standard distribution\u201d) to the mean or median of each of the other distributions. In effect, the \u201cstandard\u201d distribution is left unchanged.

In this and earlier chapters I describe many summary measures of the health status of population groups, e.g., the percents in categories of self-reported health, mean age at death, age-adjusted death rate, disease prevalence ratio, and life expectancy. In comparing such measures for two or more population groups, there are several choices. First, one can take the absolute difference between the measures. For this purpose one group must be selected as a standard or basis of comparison. One can select as the standard the value for the \u201cleading\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d group (e.g., age-adjusted death rate in State A), to be compared with the value for the lagging group (e.g., age-adjusted death rate in State B). The absolute difference between the leading value and the lagging value provides an indication of the distance the lagging group has to go in order to close the gap between the two groups. Alternatively, the leading value may be a future target value (e.g., life expectancy in 2015) and the other value may be the figure for the current date (e.g., life expectancy in 2005). The absolute difference between the target value and the current value provides an indication of the progress required to reach the target.",

The two halves of the century can be distinguished by their very different gains in life expectancy. Major shifts also occurred in the age incidence and the causal pattern of mortality rates between the first half and the second half of the century. Prevention and control of infectious diseases explain much of the increase in life expectancy at birth in the first half of the century, and reductions in the chronic diseases of later life explain much of the increase in the second half of the century. In general, improvements in nutrition, personal hygiene, public sanitation (i.e., water supply and sewage disposal), and housing conditions account for most of the reduction in death rates during the first half of the century. The greater access to health care, medical advances, and adoption of a healthier lifestyle (e.g., reduced smoking) mainly account for the reductions in death rates during the second half of the century (Fried 2000).

First, at a time when the general level of mortality was far higher than it is today, infectious diseases headed the list of causes while today the list is headed by the chronic diseases of later life. Second, both then and now several chronic diseases, particularly heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and cancer, are in the top ten.

Even if current cause-specific death rates do not change, expected population changes alone would result in some reordering of the causes. For example, if a hypothetical distribution of deaths by cause was obtained as the product of the middle series of projections of population for 2050 published by the U.S. Census Bureau and recent recorded age-sex-cause-specific death rates, all causes except heart disease, the other cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes would lose ground, relative to these three causes, between 2000 and 2050 (Sonnenschein and Brody 2005). To determine the shift in the pattern of causes resulting from changes both in age structure and in cause-specific death rates, we need to combine population projections for 2050 with projections of mortality rates by cause-categories, age, and sex. Such data can be derived from the files of the U.S. Social Security Administration, which prepares its U.S. population projections by making assumptions about future cause-specific mortality. In the industrialized countries a few causes of death now dominate the cause-pattern of mortality. Some notes on these leading causes are set forth below, drawing mainly from the lists of the 15 leading causes of death at each age in the United States published annually by the NCHS (Table 6.5; U.S. NCHS 2007b).",

In recent decades, overall life expectancy in Europe has been increasing, but Eastern Europe has experienced a decline \u2013 a sharp decline in some countries. As a result, the gap among countries of the European continent widened in the 1990s after converging in the previous decade. As noted above, the drop in life expectancy in Russia and in other countries of Eastern Europe is a result of the social and economic disorder in these countries following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.",

Extending the notion of a demographic transition, Omran used the phrase \u201cepidemiological transition\u201d to characterize the shifts in the cause-of-death and cause-of-morbidity patterns that occurred mainly in the last century. The cause patterns shifted from a predominance of acute, infectious and parasitic diseases to a predominance of chronic, degenerative diseases of later life, and accident-related and \u201cself-imposed\u201d conditions (Omran, 1971, 1977; Siegel 1993; Olshansky et al. 1997). The chronic degenerative diseases of later life are similar to the endogenous (intrinsic) diseases, which, as we may recall from 10.1007/978-94-007-1315-4_3, comprise such diseases as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, kidney diseases, and emphysema. The shift in concern for the acute infectious diseases to the chronic degenerative diseases has been accompanied by a shift in attention from the transmission of pathogenic agents to concerns, first, about the deterioration in physiological systems of the body and, then, about healthy behavior, healthy lifestyles, and health promotion. A similar change has been occurring in many less developed countries since the third quarter of the twentieth century (Omran 1971; Gribble and Preston 1993).",

The roles of genetic, social (i.e, environmental), individual (i.e., behavioral and lifestyle), and stochastic (i.e., chance) factors in the causation of disease and mortality are complementary and interactive. These factors do not usually act independently but in innumerable complex combinations and variations, with different degrees of influence under different circumstances. Their relative impact differs for different parts of the age cycle, different groups in the population (e.g., sex, race, ethnic, marital, and socioeconomic groups), and different life experiences. Early life experiences affect health and mortality in later life as well as later-life experiences, greatly augmenting the role of environmental and behavioral factors in later life. The genetic influence on human life span over the generations varies with the genetic characteristics of the parents and their antecedents and the tendency of individuals to marry within or outside their racial/ethnic/socioeconomic group (i.e., homogamy/exogamy).",

One could say that these risks are, in effect, \u201chard-wired\u201d by evolution into the genes of humans. Carnes et al. (1996) and Carnes and Olshansky (1993) have described the stark difference in the course of the mortality rate for females, the effectiveness of natural selection, and the course of cumulative reproductive success. They note that evolution \u201cdesigned\u201d various genetic mechanisms to increase the likelihood of survival to reproductive age even under conditions of duress, and to maintain health and vigor long enough for the individual to reproduce. Evolution has not, however, designed any genetic program for aging or death in humans. \u201cAging is not a genetically controlled mechanism. It is an inadvertent byproduct of bodies surviving beyond their warranty period, i.e., the time required for reproduction, nurturing, and grandparenting\u201d (Carnes 2005). Our genes do affect our longevity, however, working singly or in combination, to control (i.e., support or suppress) various metabolic and hormonal processes directly influencing our state of health.",

Genetic diseases of this kind are likely to manifest themselves early in life although there are important exceptions. The stronger the role of genes in a disease, the earlier in life will its effects lead to disability and death. The risk of incurring some diseases and dying from them rises to about age 50 and then declines with increasing age. Cystic fibrosis, genetic dyslipidemic hypertension, and genetically determined cancers of the breast and lung are manifest by age 40 (Manton and Stallard 1994). Two of the genes that carry the mutation for breast cancer, called BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for early-onset cancer and are responsible for 5\u201310% of breast cancer cases. These genes are also implicated in hereditary ovarian cancer and prostate cancer. Genetically determined breast cancer is thought to be inherited as a dominant trait; that is, only one parent has to transmit it.6 Sometimes, genes are inherited as recessive traits, that is, an affected individual has inherited one mutated (or non-functioning) gene for the disorder from each parent.6 Cystic fibrosis and Gaucher\u2019s disease type I are recessive traits.

When such age-related vulnerabilities manifest themselves as disease or disability, biogerontologists call the process senescence. Alternatively, senescence may be defined as the progressive deterioration of bodily functions over time. This loss of function is associated with decreased fecundity (i.e., physiological ability to parent a child) and increased risk of morbidity and mortality as an individual gets older. The rate and progression of the process of somatic deterioration varies greatly from person to person and from bodily organ to bodily organ for any given person, but generally over time every organ of the body is affected.

The validity of this estimate depends on the selection of causes of death imputed to smoking. Some analysts view it as an overestimate. Smoking substantially raises one\u2019s risk of developing cancer, various cardiovascular diseases, and various respiratory diseases, and so it has the potential to reduce life expectancy by several years. It is responsible for almost a third of all deaths from cancer. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of complications of pregnancy, fetal losses, premature births, low-birth-weight infants, and infant mortality. It is teratogenic; that is, it tends to produce defects in the fetus in utero.

In the present context obesity is treated as a risk factor predisposing to disease although some analysts treat obesity as a disease as well as a risk factor. Excessive body weight, whether in the extreme form labeled obesity or in the more moderate form labeled overweight, contributes to the risk of sickness and death. Obesity is associated with an increased risk for diabetes, gall bladder disease, some types of cancers (e.g., colon cancer, kidney cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer), and a range of cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and stroke. Obesity is also a contributor to osteoarthritis, chronic fatigue, low back pain, edema (i.e., swelling in feet and ankles), insomnia, indigestion, impotence, and various conditions of the hips and knees. The Framingham Heart Study found a strong link between overweight/obesity and heart failure. This risk increases steadily with increasing body weight; it is 104 percent higher for obese persons than for nonobese persons.",

The health threat lies with abdominal fat, the fat that collects around the organs in the abdomen, rather than subcutaneous fat, the fact that lies just below the skin of the abdomen. Excess weight around the belly (i.e., abdominal obesity) is common among obese adults. Obesity with visceral, or abdominal, fat, is a particularly risky type of overweight condition because it is a high risk factor for a wide range of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The body mass index is not a good measure for this condition since the same BMI may represent very different amounts of abdominal fat and muscle may be distributed very differently in different individuals. Abdominal obesity is more satisfactorily and more simply measured by the waist-hip ratio, and it is indicated by a larger waist circumference than hip circumference. Waist circumference is intended to reflect the extent of abdominal fat, the \u201cbad\u201d fat, and hip circumference is supposed to reflect the extent of subcutaneous fat, the \u201cgood\u201d fat. The standard value for the waist-hip ratio is 0.82, and the point at which the risks for health conditions begin to \u201ctake off\u201d are 0.90 for men and 0.85 for women.",

It has not become part of the regular medical diagnostic examination, however, perhaps because it does not seem \u201cclinical\u201d enough or because agreement has not been reached as to where the waist measurement should be taken. The principal recommendation is to take the measurement at navel level and to consider the cutoff point for health problems 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women. Recent research suggests, however, using even lower cutoff points, perhaps as low as 35 for men and 33 for women, and using waist circumference and BMI jointly in crossclassified scales. Some researchers prefer to employ as a proxy measure of abdominal fat the sagittal abdominal diameter, the length of a straight line through the body from slightly below the navel to the lower back, but this is not as simple to measure as waist circumference.",

Eating is a source of pleasure, a way to deal with stress, a \u201cduty\u201d at social events, and a convenient preoccupation to avoid other more serious concerns, given that food is so readily available. For some, eating becomes an addiction. This occurs when the need to eat more than is required for sustenance becomes compulsive behavior, is subject to decreasing rational control, and becomes associated with changes in brain structure. In general, compulsive eating and an addiction to overeating are precipitated by easy access to food and poor lifestyle choices. People who act compulsively do not think about the act; the addiction is converted into a powerful automatic response. Once excess weight has been put on, it becomes extremely difficult to discard it even if a healthy life style and a diet plan are pursued in an effort to eliminate the extra weight.",

The concepts relating stress, neuroendocrine regulation, and disease leads to a hypothesis linking inflammation as a physiological factor in the development of the major chronic diseases. In the search for a unifying biological mechanism to complete the link between social risk factors, physiological responses to risks, and actual disease, many medical researchers point to inflammation as that mechanism. They hypothesize that inflammation is the common underlying cause of the major chronic diseases of later life \u2013 the cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. How does this hypothesis tie these diseases together?",

It results from the physical action of white blood cells and the chemicals they produce, including antibodies and cytokines. The characteristics of inflammation may be recalled by their rhyming Latin names \u2013 rubor (redness), tumor (swelling), calor (heat), and dolor (pain). Normally when the process of inflammation has done its job, neuroendocrine-regulation systems turn it off. According to Seeman and McEwen (1996), however, the stress response may persist, with \u201cinflammatory\u201d results. When the risk factors and stress persist, the neuroendrocrine responses and inflammation may continue and the latter become factors themselves in the causation of disease. In this way, Seeman and McEwen hypothesize, excessive activation of the HPA axis and SNS increases the risks for a number of important pathophysiologic processes, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease. As a further example, persons with excessive levels of C-reactive protein, a biomarker for inflammation, are more likely than others to develop insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes. With this condition, cells reject insulin and do not properly metabolize glucose circulating in the blood.",

Goodwin cites epidemiological and clinical evidence (e.g., the Framingham study, EPESE) to support his conclusions. He measures success in terms of survival after 5 years. In several studies, both total mortality and cardiovascular mortality were substantially decreased in the treatment group under age 80 but not in the group 80 years and over.

The reason for this specific latter outcome may be that some aged persons in the studies have disproportionately low blood pressure from various health conditions, or from having their blood pressure lowered excessively by the medication, rendering them more vulnerable under conditions of sustained stress. The broader outcome may be a result of demographic selection in that these elderly populations may already have been \u201ccleared\u201d of those with the greatest risks.

When the index is considered in terms of variations by age and cause of death, a relatively low heritability index would be expected at the younger ages because of the predominance of exogenous (extrinsic) causes and a higher index would be expected at the later ages where endogenous (intrinsic) diseases prevail. Recall, however, the powerful role of lifestyle and environment in modifying these genetic tendencies in later life.",

In groups, however there is heterogeneity, especially in health. Heterogeneity of risk is pervasive in human experience. Age, gender, and race may be viewed as biological characteristics for which risks vary, that is, characteristics that add to heterogeneity of risk. In Chaps. 3 and 4 the variation of mortality with age was discussed in considerable detail. Children and the elderly are more likely to succumb to various mortality risks (e.g., accidents, starvation, infectious diseases) than persons in the intermediate ages. Through these age-associated effects, among other ways, biological factors contribute to mortality in varying degrees, even of extrinsic mortality. Adding to the heterogeneity of risk of incurring disease in later life are three aspects of family life \u2013 socioeconomic conditions of the family when the individual was a child or teenager, life-course influences, especially health experiences, and current socioeconomic conditions of the family, as described below.",

Accordingly, a narrower and more refined definition of intrinsic deaths than the one described above was employed by Carnes et al. (2006) for their analysis of mortality partitions in biogerontological research. In their classification, several causes of death included in the intrinsic categories listed above were reassigned to extrinsic mortality, either because the principal etiological factor is an infectious agent (e.g., rheumatic heart disease, cervical cancer, infection of the kidney, chronic hepatitis, urinary tract infection), the abuse of a toxic substance (e.g., lung cancer, cirrhosis, drug dependence), or a food deficiency or excess (e.g., nutritional deficiency).",

I discussed cohort effects on later-life morbidity and mortality to a limited extent in 10.1007/978-94-007-1315-4_5, and I pursue this theme further in this section. Four different interpretations can be given to the effect of early life experiences on later-life health and longevity of the members of a birth cohort. Much of the recent research has focused on the deleterious effects of ill health in childhood on health in later life. Some of the research emphasizes the rise in socioeconomic status of the members of a cohort and the improvements in public health and medical knowledge as the members of the cohort grow older. Under these circumstances the members of the cohort tend to enjoy improved health opportunities and improved health conditions in later life as compared with their younger years. Some research has focused on the positive effects of having survived illness in childhood, whether by acquiring immunity to various infectious diseases or by becoming physically and emotionally hardened for survival to later years.6 Finally, early sickness and death tend to weed out the weaker members of a cohort so that the stronger members constitute a relatively larger share of the survivors in later life \u2013 an expression of the concept of heterogeneity of frailty in cohorts.",

The evidence would appear to argue that the chain-of-risk concept is the more tenable general interpretation of later-life health events than the acquired-immunity concept although both are at play among the individuals of a cohort and serve to explain the health-history of members of the cohort in different degrees.

Costa and Lahey estimated that at least one-fifth of the increase between 1900 and 1999 in the probability of a 65-year-old surviving to age 85 may be attributable to improved early life conditions. They attribute the remainder of the gain to a host of other changes, mostly public health improvements, such as filtration and chlorination of water, construction of integrated sewage systems, widespread vaccination against childhood diseases, improvements in the milk and food supply, and reductions in environmental pollutants and poisons.",

Barker (1997) offers medical evidence connecting nutrition during life in utero and in infancy with adult health. He maintains that short-term disturbances in nutrition, especially during fetal life, as well as chronic malnutrition during early life, have long-term negative effects on health that may result in any of several chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, and adult-onset diabetes). This conclusion has been subject to considerable debate and criticism (e.g., Ben-Shlomo and Smith 1991; Lundberg 1993; V\u00e5ger\u00f6 and Leon 1994; J\u00e4rvelin et al. 1998; Leon et al. 1998; Preston et al. 1998; Vaupel et al. 1998; Bengtsson and Lindstr\u00f6m 2000, 2003). These other researchers focus on conditions in early childhood as compared to conditions in fetal life. In the mix of early-life adverse conditions, stress and mental disorder may add to the likelihood of later-life adverse circumstances and the intergenerational transmission of social adversity and poorer physical and mental health (e.g., Wickrama et al. 2005).",

This perspective broadens the basis of late-life mortality and morbidity beyond the events of early life to include the totality of experiences throughout the life course. We can identify three component periods for the environmental/behavioral factor in later-life health and longevity, namely, early-life influences, midlife transitions, and current adult living conditions. Complementing the environmental/behavioral factor is the genetic factor. As stated, these factors interactively influence one another to determine health and longevity in later life. In addition, these factors are heavily influenced by chance at every stage of the life course. In the case of extrinsic (exogenous) morbidity and mortality, e.g., accidents, the role of the genetic factor is vastly reduced and may be described as secondary, whereas in the case of intrinsic (endogenous) morbidity and mortality, the role of the genetic factor is primary, but not usually determinative.

Some would call these social causes the \u201creal\u201d causes of the deaths with which they are associated. According to the recast distribution of deaths derived by McGinnis and Foege, of the 2,148,000 deaths in the United States in 1990, they classified 1,060,000, or about half, as socially caused and hence, preventable. About 19%, or 400,000, were attributed to the use of tobacco, 14%, or 300,000, to poor diets and inactivity, and 5%, or 100,000, to the use of alcohol. Smaller numbers were assigned to microbial agents, toxic agents, firearms, unsafe sexual behavior, motor vehicles, and illicit use of drugs. Recall that the leading \u201creal\u201d cause, tobacco use, has been indicted in the causation of a very wide range of lethal diseases: cancer, especially cancer of the lungs, esophagus, oral cavity, bladder, pancreas, and kidney; the leading cardiovascular diseases; chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, particularly asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema; prematurity and low birth weight of babies of mothers who smoke; and accidental deaths from cigarettes causing fires.",

The analyst has the difficult task of apportioning the conventional underlying causes among the social causes without overlap.

Regular exercise, proper eating, avoidance of stress, better sleep practices, cessation of smoking, and moderate consumption of alcohol may aid in slowing the progression of some diseases for some people, but their effectiveness in retarding age-related health conditions is limited. That is because of the continuing and powerful effect of age-related physiological dysregulation of the cells of the body and the important roles of genetics and chance in the etiology of disease. For example, although hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia have been identified as risk factors for peripheral artery disease and coronary artery disease, efforts to modify these risk factors will not necessarily prevent these disease outcomes or keep them from becoming progressively worse. Millions of Americans who closely follow the guidelines for a healthy lifestyle still acquire many serious diseases and, having acquired them, cannot stop their inexorable and relentless progression.

Both self-reports and performance-based measures indicate that blacks have significantly higher disability levels than whites, but socioeconomic status accounts for a substantial share of this difference (Mendes de Leon et al. 2005). Of the persons with disabilities, 91% live in housing units, 2% live in noninstitutional group quarters, and 6% live in institutional facilities.",

            "text": "There is strong evidence that age-specific disability ratios in the United States have been falling in recent decades. During the 1970s the increase in life expectancy was associated with an increase in years of disability of persons aged 65 and over, but during the 1980s and 1990s added years of life were associated with a substantial decrease in the proportion of disabled persons at these ages (Crimmins 2001, 2004; Manton and Gu 2001; Freedman et al. 2002; Manton et al. 2006). Further, the analysis of Manton et al., based on the National Long-Term Care Survey, shows that the decrease was greater during the 1990s than during the 1980s. The age-standardized figures for the proportion of chronically disabled persons decreased steadily, on a per annum basis, by 0.6% from 1982 to 1984 and by 2.2% from 1999 to 2004/2005. These declines were found to be significant for both persons with less severe disability and persons with more severe disability. Manton et al. estimate that, if the disability ratios of 1982 had not changed since that year, there would have been 9.2 million disabled persons 65 years and over in 1999 rather than the actual 7.0 million (Fig. 6.10). These declines in disability cannot be interpreted to mean that the health of the U.S. population is better now than a few decades earlier because alternative definitions of health (e.g., chronic disease prevalence) give contrary results (Parker and Thorslund 2007).\n\n",

If we combine the expectation of a tremendous aging of the population of the United States and Europe in the next half century (caused in part by the advent at the older ages of the massive number of baby boomers) with the fact that disability ratios increase with advancing age, we should expect a rapid growth in the number of disabled people in the United States and Europe in the next few decades. This expectation, however, is based on the assumption that disability ratios will remain at present levels. If, as has recently occurred in the United States, disability ratios fall, it is conceivable that the number of disabled persons will not rise and may even fall in the United States (Fig. 6.10).",

Lutz and Scherbov (2003) show that, if disability ratios are shifted only two ages up the age scale per decade, the number and proportion of disabled persons will be about the same in 2050 as in 2000.
