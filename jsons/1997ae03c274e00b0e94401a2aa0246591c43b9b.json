Emergence of a new \"killer\" disease in any part of the world is likely to be a threat world wide in today's society with very rapid means of transportation of both human and animal/animal products. Recent examples include the global outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H5N1 avian influenza, and the outbreaks of West Nile virus in United States. The rapid economic development in the Asian region during the last few decades was accompanied by massive urbanization and environmental changes, which are believed to be one of the triggers leading to the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. Wildlife animals play an ever-increasing role in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, and bats have been identified as natural reservoir host of several lethal zoonotic viruses that emerged in recent times. This review will focus on the disease outbreaks caused by emerging bat viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae.",

Paramyxoviruses contain a nonsegmented negative strand (NNS) RNA genome and share similar genomic features with three other NNS RNA virus families, Rhabdoviridae (which contains rabies and vesicular stomatitis viruses), Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses), and Bornaviridae (Borna virus). These four families are grouped taxonomically in the order Mononegavirales (Pringle, 1991) . Members of the family Paramyxoviridae are further divided into two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. The Paramyxovirinae include five genera: Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, Rubulavirus, Avulavirus, and Henipavirus (Mayo, 2002) .",

Several molecular features distinguish henipaviruses from other paramyxoviruses. While most paramyxoviruses have a genome of approximately 15,000-16,000 nt, the genome length of HeV and NiV is over 18,000 nt. The increase in genome size is mainly due to the expansion of noncoding regions located mainly at the 3' ends of the viral genes. The functional significance of these features is not known. Henipaviruses also have unique biological features. They are the only currently recognized zoonotic paramyxoviruses and are highly pathogenic with mortality rates reaching 75% or greater for NiV . The wide host range of henipaviruses is also considered uncommon for paramyxoviruses. For example, NiV naturally infects five terrestrial species in four mammalian orders. Experimental infection extends the number of susceptible terrestrial orders to five by including Rodentia. The highly virulent nature of henipaviruses combined with the lack of therapeutic treatments has led to the classification of HeV and NiV as Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) pathogens.",

In addition to the emergence of paramyxoviruses from frugivorous Pteropus bats, insectivorous Rhinolophus species have been identified as natural hosts of SARS-like viruses (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005) , and Ebola virus has been shown to have fruit bat reservoir hosts (Leroy et al., 2005) . Bats typically respond asymptomatically to virus infection and display a capacity to permit persistent virus infections (Sulkin & Allen, 1974) .

The causative agent was a novel paramyxovirus, later named Hendra virus after the location of the index case. During this outbreak, two human infections were identified. Both patients presented with myalgia, headaches, lethargy, and vertigo. One recovered after a two-week severe flu-like illness, but the other developed pneumonitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and arterial thrombosis and died from a cardiac arrest. Findings at autopsy were consistent with a viral infection. Histology revealed focal necrotizing alveolitis with many giant cells, some syncytial formation, and viral inclusion bodies (Selvey et al., 1995) . HeV was isolated from the lung, kidney, liver, and spleen of the lethal case (Murray et al., 1995b) .

The horses died of unknown causes in August 1994, and the farmer who assisted with the necropsies developed a mild meningitic illness, but recovered. Thirteen months later, the farmer became ill and died of severe encephalitis, which was confirmed to be caused by HeV (O'Sullivan et al., 1997) . Retrospective investigation revealed that the two horses had also died of HeV infection, and the farmer was infected at that time in August 1994 (Hooper et al., 1996; Rogers et al., 1996) . Compared with the two human cases involved in the Hendra outbreak, the human case in the Mackay outbreak presented two interesting differences. First, the virus seemed to have remained latent for 13 months before reactivation to eventually kill the patient. Second, the patient died of encephalitis, whereas the other two human cases presented with respiratory symptoms (Selvey et al., 1995) . In this regard, it is interesting to note that although paramyxoviruses are mainly known for their ability to cause respiratory diseases, some do have the capability to infect brain and cause encephalitic illness, such as measles viruses in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) patients (Griffin, 2001) .",

Retrospective investigations suggested that the virus was also responsible for previous disease outbreaks in pigs in peninsular Malaysia since late 1996. Knowledge of the similarities between HeV and NiV facilitated the rapid identification of fruit bats as the reservoir host of NiV. Serological sampling of various bats in Malaysia found five species with neutralizing antibodies to NiV (Field et al., 2001a; Yob et al., 2001) . They included four fruit bat species, P. hypomelanus, P. vampyrus, Cynopterus brachyotis, Eonycteris spelaea, and an insectivorous bat, Scotophilus kuhlii. NiV was subsequently identified and isolated from bat urine samples of P. hypomelanus and from a partially eaten fruit swab (Chua et al., 2002a) . The genome sequences of bat isolates were largely indistinguishable from human NiV isolates (Chua et al., 2002a) .",

Mortality in the treated and control groups was 32% and 54%, respectively, indicating a significant reduction in the treatment group. In vitro, ribavirin has been shown to inhibit replication of HeV (Wright et al., 2004) . In the absence of other therapies, ribavirin is an option for treatment of henipavirus infection.

A total of 17 serum samples from 18 patients were analyzed for NiV-specific antibodies by ELISA. Nine out of the 17 sera were positive for IgM and IgG, and one sample was positive for IgG, but negative for IgM. In addition, six urine samples collected from the 18 patients were also tested by PCR and virus isolation. While there was no virus isolated using Vero E6 cells, five of the six urine samples were PCR-positive, four from sero-positive patients and one from a sero-negative patient. Analysis of a partial sequence from the M gene indicated that the etiologic agent was a strain of NiV, which has a close sequence homology with both the Malaysian and Bangladesh NiV isolates (94% and 99% sequence identity, respectively) (Chadha et al., 2006) . The reservoir host for NiV in India has not been identified yet, but it is most likely to be the bat species P. giganteus, as suspected to be the case for the Bangladesh NiV outbreaks (Hsu et al., 2004; ICCDRB, 2005) or another closely-related flying fox species.",

These animals represented 16 species from six of the seven bat families known to be present in Cambodia. Serum samples from 1,072 bats were taken for NiV antibody ELISA testing and positive signals were obtained only in the species P. lylei with a seroprevalence of 10.9% (50 out of 458), corroborating the results conducted in the first study (Olson et al., 2002) . Sera from other bat species were all negative and so were the limited number of human sera (n = 8) tested from individuals who had contact with sero-positive Lyle bats in restaurants. Attempts to isolate live virus from 769 urine samples yielded two virus isolates from urine samples collected at the same time from a roost of P. lylei bats in a village. Sequencing of the N and G genes indicated that the two isolates had identical sequences and that they shared a nucleotide sequence identity of 98% and 98.2%, respectively, with their Malaysian counterpart. Phylogenetic analysis based on current available henipavirus sequences suggest that the NiV isolate from Cambodian bats is more closely related to Malaysian isolates of NiV than isolates from Bangladesh.",

During March 2002 and February 2004, 1,304 bats were sampled from 15 sites covering nine provinces in central, eastern, and southern Thailand. Among the 12 bat species sampled, six were frugivorous and six were insectivorous. In addition to serum samples taken for NiV antibody tests, saliva (1,286 samples) and urine (1,282) swabs were also taken and analyzed by PCR for the presence of NiV-related sequences. From 1,054 sera tested, 82 positive samples (i.e., positive in NiV IgG ELISA) were obtained from four different species: 76 from P. lylei, four from P. hypomelanus, and one each from P. vampyrus and the insectivorous Hipposideros larvatus. PCR analysis using NiV N-gene specific primers demonstrated the presence of NiV-related viruses in both saliva and urine samples collected from different sites. While most of the positive samples were collected from P. lylei as expected, there was one positive saliva pool sample from H. larvatus (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2005) . It is interesting to note that sequence analysis based on a 181-nt N gene PCR fragment indicated that the H. larvatus isolate was more closely related to the Malaysian NiV isolates, whereas the P. lylei isolates were more closely related to the Bangladesh isolates. It remains to be seen whether this pattern of homology will hold when the full-length genome sequences are compared.",

In the 2003 outbreak in Naogaon, cases were more likely to have had contact with a herd of pigs that had passed through the area prior to the outbreak (ICDDRB, 2003) . In Rajbari in 2004, Nipah cases were more likely to have climbed trees where bats had been and to have contact with patients. In the 2004 Faridpur outbreak, contact with ill persons was the primary risk factor. In the 2005 outbreak in Tangail, drinking fresh date palm juice potentially contaminated with bat secretions was considered the main route of transmission for most of the Nipah infections (ICDDRB, 2005) . Transmission of henipaviruses from bats to amplifying hosts depends on the susceptibility of the latter to oral infection and the titer of virus in urine, partially eaten fruit, or fetal tissues. The minimum infectious dose for horses or pigs is not known, but it is of interest that the minimum oronasal lethal dose of NiV for hamsters is 47,000 plaque forming units (pfu), compared with 270 pfu administered parenterally (Wong et al., 2003) . It may also be pertinent that henipaviruses are isolated only rarely and in low titers from the urine of naturally or experimentally infected animals, but are more readily detected in tissues including those of the fetus (Williamson et al., 1998 (Williamson et al., , 2000 .",

Although HeV generates predominantly respiratory infections, the virus was detected infrequently in the upper respiratory tract of infected horses, suggesting that aerosol transmission to either man or horses is highly unlikely (Hooper et al., 1997) . The failure to transmit HeV from experimentally infected to uninfected, in-contact horses is consistent with this suggestion (Williamson et al., 1998) . The presence of HeV in equine saliva suggested that manual feeding of the animals may have facilitated horse to human transmission (Selvey et al., 1995) . In contrast to the paucity of HeV virions in the upper respiratory tract of horses, NiV was readily observed in the respiratory epithelium of naturally and experimentally infected pigs. Thus the virus probably spread to humans and within the pig population by aerosol or by direct contact with oropharyngeal or nasal secretions (Middleton et al., 2002; Mohd. Nor et al., 2000) .",

Current strategies for controlling or preventing HeV epizootics are built around the three hypotheses for virus transmission from fruit bats to amplifying hosts listed above.

In contrast, the involvement of spillover hosts was not an obvious aspect of the outbreaks in Bangladesh and probably West Bengal (Chadha et al., 2006) .

In addition, decreasing the potential for fruit bat-pig interactions is also a major strategy to reduce the possibility of spillover events leading to disease emergence, and include simple measures such as removing fruit trees or orchards from the immediate vicinity of pig sheds, wire screening of open-sided pig sheds to prevent fruit bat access, and ensuring that roof run-off does not enter pig pens (Mackenzie et al., 2003; Field et al., 2004) . It is also important that a rapid laboratory diagnostic capability is available with experienced veterinarians to interpret test results, and where necessary, to respond to and conduct outbreak investigations. In Bangladesh and West Bengal, the two most appropriate control measures at this time are to ensure all patients with possible NiV infection are barrier nursed with strict prevention of contact with visitors or other patients, and washing of all fruit for human consumption as well as ensuring all fruit juice is kept under conditions which restrict access to fruit bats.",

Of especial concern is the apparent human to human transmission of NiV in Bangladesh and India. Further investigation is warranted to determine the transmission routes of NiV, especially in the nosocomial setting. The possibility of human to human transmission becomes very important in all future control strategies. It also increases the potential for Nipah to become a disease of international significance.",

From the genetic diversity observed from limited genome sequences obtained so far, it is almost certain that other related viruses will emerge from Pteropus species or other fruit bats sharing the same or similar habitats. What we do not know is how genetically different they will be and whether they will be more or less transmissible to and among the human population. For example, the Pteropus sp in the western Indian Ocean are believed to have separated from other Pteropus sp more than 60,000 years ago. If one assumes that viruses coevolve with these hosts, one might expect that henipa-like viruses from these bats could be genetically very different from the ones isolated to date. This will undoubtedly have significant impact on our current diagnosis and control/prevention strategies.",
