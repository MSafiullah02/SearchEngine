This mechanism of action is broadly effective against extracellular and intracellular transfusion\u2010transmitted DNA/RNA\u2010containing pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. THERAFLEX MB\u2010Plasma combines MB\u2014a phenothiazine compound that intercalates into viral nucleic acid\u2014with visible light. The illumination of MB\u2010treated plasma results in the generation of singlet oxygen, which leads to the destruction of viral nucleic acids and thus prevents viral replication.12 Because MB only partially penetrates cell membranes, MB/light treatment is less effective against intracellular viruses. This is why two filters are integrated in the process chain. Although the second filter mainly removes MB and its photoactivated products after illumination, both filters have multiple layers of small\u2010meshed membranes capable of removing residual WBCs, RBCs, and PLTs that may carry intracellular pathogens. It was recently shown that the two filters efficiently remove high levels (up to 5.9 log colony\u2010forming units per milliliter) of viable bacteria and bacterial spores.25 It can be assumed that parasites of similar sizes can also be removed by the THERAFLEX MB\u2010Plasma procedure. A previous investigation showed that the filtration step before the addition of MB and visible light illumination was critical to achieving the complete and reproducible elimination of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease.26\n",

Thus, it is imperative that manufacturers continuously challenge their PI systems with new infectious agents. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the efficacy of UVC and MB/light against MERS\u2010CoV and EBOV or any other member of the Coronaviridae and Filoviridae families.

As in a previous study, the observed reduction of EBOV titers and MERS\u2010CoV titers in the present study was beyond the expected dilution factor in PCs and plasma.28 This phenomenon may occur due to the presence of nonspecific immune mediators that neutralize viruses in plasma.28, 29 The mean log reduction factors of at least 3.7 (MERS\u2010CoV) and at least 4.5 (EBOV) in PCs treated with UVC and of at least 3.3 (MERS\u2010CoV) and at least 4.6 (EBOV) in plasma treated with MB/light suggest that both PI technologies used in this study are considerably effective against these two virus types.",

            "text": "This study had a number of limitations. For example, the number of replicates was limited by safety constraints, as experiments with MERS\u2010CoV and EBOV are subject to the highest biosafety level. In addition, large\u2010volume plating could not be performed, although this would have improved the detection limit and enabled more exact determination of log reduction factors. Although plasma viral RNA loads in MERS\u2010CoV patients may be up to 6 log genome copies/mL, and median viral RNA loads of up to 6.68 log genome copies/mL have been detected in the blood of Ebola patients,30, 31 virus titers in the plasma of asymptomatic infected or convalescent individuals recruited to donate blood may be significantly lower. As it is known for other infectious diseases, EBOV viral titers expressed in genome copies per milliliter do not necessarily reflect the infectivity titer. While viral titers measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction are based on the detection of a small fragment of the viral genome, infectivity titers describe the number of intact, functional viral units required for replication and disease transmission. Although EBOV is highly infectious and low doses of less than 10 plaque\u2010forming units of the virus are sufficient to cause disease,32 the ability of the UVC\u2010 and MB/light\u2013based systems to reduce MERS\u2010CoV and EBOV infectivity in blood products by several log steps may be sufficient to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk of transmission via the transfusion of PCs or plasma.
