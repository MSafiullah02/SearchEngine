            "text": "Highly pathogenic human coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1\u20136) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (7\u20139) cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in humans. These zoonotic pathogens have mortality rates of >50% in aged and immunosuppressed populations, making them potentially important emerging pathogens (10, 11). Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against these coronaviruses (and other highly pathogenic viruses) will facilitate rapid responses to pandemic threats. Transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease belonging to the type II transmembrane serine protease family, cleaves the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) molecule in human airway epithelial cells (12); however, it can also cleave coronavirus fusion glycoproteins, namely, the spike protein. The protease activates the spike protein to induce virus-cell membrane fusion at the cell surface and facilitate entry of coronaviruses into the host cell (13\u201316). Thus, active-site inhibitors of TMPRSS2 are potential therapeutic targets for not only influenza viruses but also coronaviruses (17). Some animal studies show that TMPRSS2-knockout (KO) mice are protected against severe pathology and death after influenza virus infection (18\u201321). In addition, a genetic study revealed that those with high expression of certain TMPRSS2 variants are at increased risk of severe outcomes after infection with A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza (22). However, the roles of TMPRSS2 in vivo during coronavirus infection are unclear. Here, we used animal models of coronavirus infection to examine the role of TMPRSS2.",

The animals were moribund due to severe pulmonary edema caused by skewing the immune response toward a Th2 profile after infection by mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (23, 24). We used adult C57BL/6 mice because the TMPRSS2-KO mice were backcrossed to this strain (20). After infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice developed acute pneumonia, with around 15% body weight loss; however, this was not fatal. In addition, we recently generated an animal model of MERS-CoV using transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 (hDPP4-Tg mice) under the control of an endogenous promoter (25). The hDPP4-Tg mice were susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV and developed acute pneumonia with transient loss of body weight. Next, we generated TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg (TMPRSS2-KO Tg) mice by crossing male hDPP4-Tg mice with female TMPRSS2-KO mice.",

The mice were then used to examine the role of TMPRSS2 after MERS-CoV infection. After intranasal inoculation with human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC) 2012 (MERS-CoV), hDPP4-Tg mice showed a temporary and mild loss of body weight (from 6 to 9 days p.i.); however, only very slight changes were observed in TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice (Fig. 5a).

The protein sequence of human and mouse TMPRSS2 is conserved, with 78% sequence identity between the two species. In situ hybridization analyses of mouse embryos and adult tissues reveal that TMPRSS2 is expressed in the epithelia lining the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and respiratory tracts, including the bronchi and bronchioles, but not in alveolar epithelium (31). Kim et al. showed that depletion of TMPRSS2 (the molecule was inactivated by disrupting the serine protease domain through homologous recombination) from mice did not affect development or survival to adulthood, nor were there abnormalities in organ histology or function (32). While the physiological function of TMPRSS2 is unclear, data suggest that it does regulate sodium currents in lung epithelial cells through proteolytic cleavage of the epithelial sodium channel (33). We also made the interesting observation that TMPRSS2-deficient mice show weaker, or delayed, inflammatory chemokine and cytokine responses mediated by Toll-like receptor 3.",

            "text": "Host cellular proteases such as trypsin, tryptase Clara, miniplasmin, human airway trypsin-like protease, and TMPRSS2 cleave the HA glycoprotein of influenza A viruses. Cleavage of HA is critical for viral entry into cells during fusion between the viral and host cell membranes (34). Serine protease inhibitors such as camostat and aprotinin inhibit both influenza virus replication in human airway epithelial cells and the release of cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) into cell supernatants (35). In addition, animal studies using TMPRSS2-KO mice revealed that TMPRSS2 is essential for the spread and pathogenesis of influenza viruses such as emerging H7N9 and seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 (18\u201321). TMPRSS2 also cleaves the coronavirus spike protein to generate unlocked, fusion-catalyzing forms at the cell surface and facilitate rapid early entry (14, 15, 36\u201340). In addition, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV enter cells via two distinct pathways, TMPRSS2 via the cell surface and cathepsin L via the endosome (13, 14, 16, 37, 41, 42). A previous antiviral study revealed that a serine protease (TMPRSS2) rather than a cysteine protease (cathepsin L) facilitated the spread of SARS-CoV in the infected mouse (43). Our findings are in agreement with this study; coronavirus replication in the lungs, especially in the bronchioles, was less pronounced in TMPRSS2-deficient mice. However, viral spread and inflammatory infiltration were still detected in the alveoli. Several proteases, including other serine proteases and the cysteine protease cathepsin L, may activate both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, allowing the virus to spread to alveolar areas in TMPRSS2-deficient mice. In addition, TLR3 mRNA expression in the lungs at 6 h p.i. of SARS-CoV-inoculated TMPRSS2-deficient mice suggested that TLR3, which recognizes specifically dsRNA and localizes to endosomes (44), recognized viral RNA within the endosomal component. Thus, we speculate that the pathway employing cathepsin L and the endosome mainly contributed to SARS-CoV infection in the TMPRSS2-deficient mice.",

Thus, MERS-CoV may rely more on TMPRSS2 during early infection than mouse-adapted SARS-CoV although differences in viral passage history and in the genetic backgrounds of the animals should also be considered.

Peak expression of FGF-basic, also known as FGF2, after infection synchronized with peak body weight loss in WT and hDPP4-Tg mice. FGFs play a role in tissue repair after pneumonia, including bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and interstitial pneumonia (both fibrous pulmonary disorders), by promoting proliferation of fibroblasts (45). In fact, formation of granulation tissue was observed in WT mice after SARS-CoV infection. BOOP and pulmonary fibrosis are common in patients with SARS, including those who survive the infection (46). While there is limited evidence for development of fibrosis during end-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by MERS-CoV, clinical data from MERS patients suggest that the situation is similar to that observed for SARS (46, 47). In addition, some metabolic FGFs cause body weight loss (48).",

This result is similar to results reported for TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 double-KO mice on day 3 postinfection with H3N2 influenza A virus (49). High levels of virus replication very likely induce severe tissue damage and increased cellular infiltration by immune cells. Viral replication is likely a major cause of the elevated inflammatory chemokine levels observed in WT mice; nevertheless, we assessed the possibility that TMPRSS2, a serine protease, may also contribute to inflammatory reactions after TLR3 stimulation. Intranasal administration of poly(I\u00b7C) induced expression of MCP-1, KC, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-12 in the lungs of WT mice but not in those of TMPRSS2-KO mice. The genetic backgrounds of WT and TMPRSS2-KO mice were the same because the TMPRSS2-KO mice were produced from TMPRSS2 gene knockout C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cells. The physiological function of TMPRSS2 remains unclear; however, TMPRSS2 may contribute to more severe or rapid immunopathology in WT mice by increasing the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines after TLR3 stimulation.",
