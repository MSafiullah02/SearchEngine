The epidemic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to 30 countries, resulting in over 8000 cases and nearly 800 deaths in 2003 (WHO, 2003). By the end of 2009, the pandemic H1N1 virus had spread to more than 208 countries, resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases and at least 18,000 deaths (World Health Organization (WHO). Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Massaro and Bagnoli, 2014). By June 2016, more than 28,000 Ebola cases had been reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with more than 11,000 deaths (WHO, 2015). Globally, 2103 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including at least 733 related deaths, had been reported to the WHO by 1 November 2017 (WHO, 2017). All of these infectious diseases initially occurred in a few countries and rapidly spread to others. Knowledge on the association between human mobility and infectious disease transmission is very important for infection control (Barmak et al., 2016).",

Research on infection spread across cities and countries has mainly focused on human mobility based on historical data processing (Opatowski et al., 2011) and mathematical models (Charu et al., 2017). Hyman and LaForce (2003) constructed a mathematical SIPR (where P is the stage of partial immunity) infection spread model across cities and analysed long-term infection spread trends. Kim et al. (2014) developed a mathematical model of multi-city transmission and simulated the outbreaks of pandemic influenza A in Korea across cities considering transportation impacts. Gautreau et al. (2008) used the Rvachev\u2013Longini metapopulation model to analyse the arrival times of infectious disease on a global scale. Balcan et al. (2009) used a mobility (GLEaM) model to obtain multi-scale mobility networks to simulate infection spread across countries. Travellers, including business travellers, play an important role in infection spread across cities and countries (Wang et al., 2012). In the global network of human mobility (Du et al., 2016), travellers connect all cities and countries. Therefore, knowledge on how travel behaviour affects infectious disease transmission is useful to the prevention and control of infection spread between cities or even between countries. However, the previous research was insufficient because of a lack of the quantitative comparison between the source and downstream cities, the impacts of travel patterns, and efficiency of different surveillance strategies in the transportation hubs.",

In Fig. 5(a), infectious disease transmits from source city A to end city E city by city (i.e., A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D\u2192E). To maintain a constant population in each city at all times, \u03b4=1% is set in cities A and E and \u03b4=2% is set in cities B, C and D. The peak value of infected individuals during outbreaks is the same in cities B, C and D, with an average \u0394PABCD=0.50% (Fig. 5(a)). The \u2206P between the middle cities is close to 0. City E is the end city and \u0394PAE=2.33%. Comparing \u0394PAE to the \u0394Pcscd with only two cities (Fig. 2(a)), the \u2206P between the source city and the end city is almost the same (\u0394PAE\u2248\u0394Pcscd). In Fig. 5(a), city B receives infected tourists from source city A during the infection rising period and delivers infected people to city C at the same time. City A, B, and C like three bottles of solution. City B receives a highly concentrated solution from city A, but is also diluted by city C. However, \u0394PDE is high because the end city (E) only absorbs the highly concentrated solution from city D without any dilution caused by the other cities. Therefore, \u0394PDE and \u0394PAB are big, whereas \u0394PBC and \u0394PCD are very small.",

However, the outbreak occurrence time is delayed in downstream cities. For example, the outbreak occurrence time in city C is delayed by 5 days, in city B by 12 days and in cities D and E by 15.4 days. This strategy cannot reduce the severity of outbreaks, but it can delay the outbreak occurrence time. This gives the government more time to make emergency plans. The local government usually requests individuals to avoid densely populated areas, such as shopping malls, to reduce the number of person-to-person contacts per day during infection outbreaks (Fig. 7(b)). When infectious disease is very serious, some strategies, such as work stoppage, school closure and shopping mall closure, are implemented. In this situation, the probability of person-to-person contact is decreased. Even the probability of tourists spreading infection or becoming infected decreases.

            "text": "Infectious diseases have different basic reproductive ratios (R\n0). For example, that for H1N1 is approximately 1.8 (De Silva et al., 2009), that for H7N9 is between 0.6 and 2.5 (Yang et al., 2015) and that for norovirus is between 5.3 and 9.3 (Lee et al., 2011). R\n0 influences not only infection spread in a city, but also the infection severity between the downstream city and the source city. The lower R\n0 is, the higher the peak value of the \u2206P between the source city and the downstream city becomes. \u0394Pcscd was mainly caused by mobility other than infection (Fig. 1). And increasing R\n0 leads to enhancement of the impact brought by infection, therefore, the \u0394Pcscd will decrease because of weaker impact by mobility. Moreover, the higher R\n0 is, the higher the travel rate must be to reach the highest \u0394Pcscd. With an increasing travel rate, the \u0394Pcscd increases first then goes down. For example, if there is only one infected traveller going to the downstream city and only one resident in the downstream city is infected (travel rate \u2192 0), the trend of the number of the infected would be the same for both the source and the downstream cities (all of them are caused by only one infected person), and there is no difference between the peak value of the infected (\u0394Pcscd==0). When the travel rate is 0.5, which means residents in the source and downstream cities are sufficiently mixed, two cities would have the same curves of number of infected people ((\u0394Pcscd==0). Therefore, there is a specific value of travel rate can lead to the highest \u0394Pcscd. The average travel rate in China is 2.34% (CNTA, 2016). When H1N1 spreads (R0=1.8), \u0394Pcscd reaches a maximum when the travel rate is 4%. During normal periods, the travel rate is generally lower than 4%. However, the travel rate rapidly increases when certain festivals, such as the Spring Festival (the most important festival in China), arrive. At such times, governments should also focus on infectious disease prevention and control in downstream cities rather than only in source cities.",

For infectious diseases with low transfer rate (\u03b2\u2193) but a high infectious period (\u03b3\u2193), downstream cities are strongly influenced by the associated source city (\u0394Pcscd\u2191). When the infectious period increases, there is a longer time to spread disease when tourists from the source city travel to downstream cities. The severity of infection in downstream cities is strengthened. In addition, under a travel rate of 1%, with increasing travel duration (from 1 to 7 days), the population exchange rate between two cities reduces and the impacts of the source city on downstream cities weaken. In reality, the average travel duration is decided by vacation arrangements. For example, only 1\u20132 days of travel can occur on weekends, but the average travel duration can be between 5 and 7 days when the Spring Festival or National Day arrives. We find that when the quotient of travel duration (tT) and travel rate (\u03b4) is a constant (tT/\u03b4=50 in this study), \u0394Pcscd reaches a maximum. Governments may consider different emergency plans based on the characteristics of travel patterns. \u0394Pcscd reaches a maximum of 4.40% when the travel rate is 4.0% and the travel duration is 2.66 days. The increased severity of the downstream city is slight. In reality, this influence is ignored because it is easily covered by other impacts caused by environmental differences (e.g., temperature and humidity), cultural differences and individual characteristics between cities. Our results are obtained for the same settings in all cities.",

In general, travel-related factors influence infection spread between cities, but the impacts are limited. In the study, we found that the infection enhancement in downstream cities brought by travel is much weaker than those by some environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. Normally, travel can only bring no more than 4% infection enhancement in downstream cities and the impact is relatively low compared with environment factors. However, downstream cities should be paid more attention because infection intensity in downstream cities is no weaker than the source city.",

Our simulation shows that the severity of infectious disease transmission is difficult to control if only tourist surveillance between cities is used. This strategy can help delay the outbreak occurrence time and provide governments more time to prepare efficient emergency plans. City-entry surveillance of non-hub cities is only useful to the target city that measures tourist surveillance. The positive impacts on other cities can be ignored. City-entry surveillance of hub cities is not only useful to the hub cities, but also to cities with strong connections (i.e., a high travel rate) to them. However, for cities with little or no tourist exchange with hub cities, the positive impacts of hub city entry surveillance are weak. The city-exit surveillance of hub cities contributes to downstream cities, but only slightly to above said hub cities. Both the city-entry and -exit surveillance of hub cities are the most effective for infection control, although requiring more manpower and consuming more resources. Tourist surveillance of hub cities is much more efficient than of other cities and can provide local governments more time to prepare emergency plans to reduce the threat of infectious disease.",

The efficiency of strategies that only improve the individual immunity of frequent travellers is limited. However, the outbreak occurrence time can be slightly delayed in downstream cities. Individuals can either wear a mask or get vaccinated to reduce infection risk. Governments can limit the travel rate between cities and the probability of person-to-person contact via work stoppage (Zhang et al., 2018a) and school closure (Gemmetto et al., 2014) to reduce infection risk.
