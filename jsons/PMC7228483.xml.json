Our study highlights that over 25% of YouTube\u2019s most viewed English videos contained non-factual or misleading information, reaching over 62 million views and nearly 25% of total viewership. There were high proportions of non-factual videos in the entertainment and internet news categories and moderate amounts in consumer and network news categories. In comparison with these sources, professional and government videos demonstrated higher accuracy, usability and quality across all measures but were largely under-represented in our sample. Our findings, which are consistent with those published in similar studies,8 10 11 suggest the lack of access of professional and government sources to individuals who use YouTube as a source of health information and a missed opportunity for dissemination of high-quality content.",

The proliferation and spread of misinformation can exacerbate racism and fear and result in unconstructive and dangerous behaviour,18 19 such as toilet paper hoarding and mask stealing behaviours seen so far in the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, this misinformation impedes the delivery of accurate pandemic-related information, thus hindering efforts by public health officials and healthcare professionals to fight the pandemic.18 19\n",

In current times, social media has emerged as a powerful tool in controlling the spread of information and in shaping public understanding and behaviour. YouTube is a powerful, untapped educational tool that should be better mobilised by health professionals to control information and influence public behaviour. Given that professionals and government organisations provide the highest quality content, these groups should find strategies to increase the viewership and the impact of their videos on YouTube. Many existing marketing strategies are static, in the form of published guidelines, statistical reports and infographics and may not be as appealing or accessible to the general public. Using multimedia and multiple social media platforms, including YouTube, will allow for greater impact. Furthermore, past research has demonstrated that using different emotional tones (eg, humour and anger) to deliver health information may increase public belief in such messages,20 which may consequently increase adherence. While members of governments and professionals already make appearances on network news programmes, partnerships between public health agencies and the creators of consumer and entertainment news videos may be an effective strategy to broaden their reach and impact. As an example, the most viewed video on YouTube at the time of this study, with over 20 million views, was produced by a popular YouTube and television celebrity.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the accuracy and quality of the most widely viewed YouTube videos and their publishing sources during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, this study provides important insights into how professional organisations and health agencies can collaborate with content creators on YouTube to deliver high-quality information to a larger audience.

            "text": "This study also has limitations to consider. First, this is a cross-sectional study at one time point. However, as YouTube is a dynamic platform, any search strategy would have this limitation. In addition, this limitation is unlikely to affect our conclusion given that they are supported by other studies at other time points.8 10 11 The search strategy, developed a priori, captured the top 75 videos for each of the two keywords; however, many of these videos were excluded per the reasons noted in figure 1, resulting in a final sample size of 69 videos. In future studies, the significant number of potential videos that may be excluded should be considered prior to data collection; however, this is difficult to predict ahead of time. Regardless, our sample size is larger than some other similarly designed studies on YouTube content published, such as Radonjic et al\u2019s13 analysis of YouTube videos on abdominal aortic aneurysms (n=51 videos). Furthermore, the total viewership of our 69 included videos was 257 804 146 views and greatly surpasses the total viewership reported in other studies on diseases the WHO has declared as pandemics (H1N1: 5.1 million views for 142 videos8) or considered to be public health emergencies of international concern (Ebola in 2014: 9.1 million views for 118 videos9). Importantly, the goal of this present study was to assess the quality of the content that the most YouTube viewers are watching. We achieved this goal well with our sample size, methodology and total viewership of 257 804 146 views. The inclusion of only English videos presents a language bias and may limit the generalisability of our results to different languages and countries. As the literature lacks a validated tool to evaluate COVID-19 related content, we developed an unvalidated but objective COVID-19 specific scoring system to assess the videos included in our study. In addition, our search was limited to the YouTube platform and, consequently, YouTube videos present on other internet sites were not captured.",
