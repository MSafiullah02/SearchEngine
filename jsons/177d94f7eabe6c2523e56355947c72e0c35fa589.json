When diagnostic efforts and/or empiric treatment fails, thoracic surgeons have traditionally been called upon to perform surgical biopsy of the lung to aid in the diagnosis of indeterminate, life-threatening pulmonary disease. Such biopsy has been requested specifi cally in the case of diffuse lung disease among patients receiving treatment for solid-organ or hematologic cancers, particularly when symptoms of respiratory failure progress and when noninvasive diagnostic tests and empiric treatments fail to halt progression. In such circumstances, radiologists, pulmonologists, and thoracic surgeons may be consulted and asked to provide tissue specimens that will allow rapid, accurate diagnosis leading to specifi c treatment. It is imperative that biopsy take place before respiratory failure supervenes [ 1 ] , and that the specimens provided to clinical laboratories, pathologists, and microbiologists are comprehensive and properly preserved.",

Most patients with diffuse pulmonary disease can have an accurate diagnosis made without a direct biopsy of the lung. When this cannot be established in a relatively short time, thoracotomy and biopsy should be carried out without hesitation. [ 3 ] This statement is as cogent today as it was 46 years ago, but from the perspective of the thoracic surgeon, consults on patients during and following treatment of solid-organ and hematopoietic neoplasms in whom it was early recognized that \"virtually any infectious agent can cause pulmonary disease in any immunocompromised host\" [ 4 ] are increasingly complex. In such patients, the ratio of risk to benefi t is often substantial. For a successful outcome, the biopsy must provide defi nitive identifi cation of a specifi c etiology. That disease, in turn, must be amenable to successful treatment. Finally, intervention will prove futile if the patient's cancer recurs or progresses.",

There are literally thousands of drugs and drug combinations used in the treatment of cancer, and new agents and combinations are added on a frequent basis. Many of these agents have inherent lung toxicity, and most impair the immune response, fostering infection with a wide spectrum of organisms that are seldom, if ever, pathogenic in healthy individuals [ 9 ] . These considerations are further amplifi ed in patients who undergo stem-cell transplantation. Profound and prolonged immunosuppression allows an even broader range of infectious pathogens and adds lung damage secondary to other mechanisms (e.g., diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, radiation pneumonitis, and graft-versus-host disease [GVHD] ) [ 10 ] . Adding further complexity, the entities in the expanded differential diagnosis list are addressed using a plethora of new diagnostic methods which, in their turn, have morphed over time.

This is most often done under light sedation and local anesthesia. After the needle is removed, a rapid CT scan survey of the chest is done to evaluate for early pneumothorax, significant bleeding, and air embolization (a rare but potentially devastating complication, especially if not recognized before the patient is allowed to get off the CT table).

Importantly, this group found that a difference between preoperative clinico-radiological and fi nal histological diagnosis suffi cient to change prognosis and defi nitive management was made in 27.1 % of patients. Kreider and colleagues found that complications in patients who underwent VATS diagnostic biopsy were higher in those who were dependent on oxygen and those who have pulmonary hypertension [ 46 ] . Utz et al. found that a DLCO of <35 % predicted and a diagnosis of idiopathic usual interstitial pneumonia were predictors of mortality as well [ 47 ] . Preoperative ventilator dependence and an immunocompromised status were the only predictors of mortality [ 67 ] in Lettieri's analysis [ 48 ] . Unfortunately, many patients who have life-threatening pulmonary infi ltrates will have one or more of the above risk factors and thus worse survival. Those who are acutely ill or are in a late stage of the disease have decreased pulmonary compliance and decreased DLCO and a limited ability to tolerate general anesthesia, particularly with single-lung ventilation.
