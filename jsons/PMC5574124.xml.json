Complementary strategies are recommended relating to open access to Zika information and knowledge, vulnerable population Aedes mosquito and ZIKV complications awareness and resilience outreach mainly pregnant women. Effective uptake and utilization of preventive measures including mosquito protection and contraceptive methods, counseling services and information dissemination, reproductive and social education and awareness strategies reinforcement in modern era of integrated  vector control and care management in the context of microcephaly and a range of congenital neurological abnormalities associated with Zika epidemic impact are also highly desired. These efforts can be tapped through reinforcing mandates of rapid response initiatives from the WHO and other agencies. Moreover, existing ethical, medical, cultural and societal issues in some affected settings might be due to public traditional and cultural practices, beliefs or myths, misconception and fear linked to resistance, intense urbanization and migration, crowding, poor sanitation and hygiene those should be addressed [4, 7, 17, 18]. To date, the best preventive measures against ZIKV include but not limited to elimination of Aedes mosquito larval water habitats in and around household and buildings under contruction including removal of air-conditioning drainage buckets, barrels and abandoned car tyres, improved hygiene and regular sanitation, good water storage containersand other backyard containers or ornamentals, well-protected sewage and adequate waste management that can provide potential mosquito breeding sites [18].",

ZIKV and other arbovirus species co-circulation and expansion resulting on specific viral seroconversion and seroprevalence is still poorly understood and require sentinel/population-based surveillance and asymptomatic reservoir diagnostic screening. If available, this can be important in anticipating, preventive measures and timely acute asymptomatic or syndromic complications management [15]. The global community has the responsibility to protect and promote the health of all people as stated in the first international Alma Ata declaration underlining the importance of primary healthcare and Human Rights [20]. The risk of microcephaly and neurological defects for many unborn children is far too great to justify any avoidable trip in Aedes-linked ZIKV settings or seek advice from medical providers in line with follow the WHO and CDC recommendations and guidelines. Most affected governments and public health authorities should provide reliable, consistent and trustful evidence-based information and communication in rebuilding  population trust, care-seeking or practicing positive behavior and attitude changes [4, 9, 21, 22]. This also include advice to returning travelers from Zika-affected areas to practice correct and consistent use of condoms and safer sex or at least 6 months sex abstinence with their partner [22]. Authors emphasizes on the significance of parents and tourists awareness and advice, pre-natal and antenatal Zika information related sexual and reproductive health education outreach mainly during early stage of pregnancy as part of public health messaging of critical importance. Also, it is still ofconcernto think of the unknown future implications of Zika-related pathophysiological, emotional and societal consequences such as trauma, stress, depression, stigmatization and social withdrawal impacts on the affected populations and nationwide socio-demographic and economic over time yet consortia of grey areas are unaddressed where:i)Epidemiological studies are often complex because Zika causes a relatively mild illness in adults and there is no widely deployed test for the virus. This means that most of the mothers who have participated in previous studies were never diagnosed with Zika, even if they contacted it. To address this problem-there is a critical need for development and deployment of more sensitive field adaptable and point of care Zika diagnostics to national/regional clinical reference laboratories.ii)As a responsiverather than reactive measure and would require that ethically and socially sound obstetricians and medical psychologists should advice couples and patients on very difficult decisions involving risk to ongoing or planned pregnancies throughout Aedes associated Zika-affected and prone settings [15, 16].iii)Proponents of delayed pregnancy [23] ought to realize and appreciate from both economic and political perspective, altered birth cohort progression throughout the region, coupled with disabled care, may have long-term disruptive political, systemic and economic impacts in these countries.\n",

With concrete association between Zika infection and birth defects, leading concerned health authorities around the globe like the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WHO and CDC had issued guidance to pregnant women and those seeking to become pregnant toconsider delaying travel to Zika-affected areas, and for those living in countries with wide-spread Zika transmission to avoid mosquito bite exposure and/or having unprotected sexual intercourse with suspected traveler/tourist, abortion, or maintenance of confidentiality in risk situations from Aedes-related Zika-prone settings [6, 25]. In some countries public health authorities havegone even further, recommending that women should postpone becoming pregnant for a period of time; most notably, the Minister of Health of El-Salvador, a country which is experiencing a rise in suspected Zika cases, has recommended delaying pregnancy until 2018. In addition, there is an urgent need to scale up integrated vector control programs including appropriate and effective preventative measures to reduce and interrupt mosquito bites exposure and sexual or blood transfusion transmission of ZIKV.",

Strengthening existing local sexual and reproductive health education and awareness outreach resilience  and preventive measures as well as improved blood transfusion screening programs in remote health community centers are needed in as much as addressing ZIKV knowledge gaps and issues:i)We are neither able to forecast the next epidemic nor efficiently prepare for its effects onthe population.

Investing on Aedes associated ZIKV advanced operational research is urgently needed to realign evidence-based local and global policies, legislation and rights in tune with the internationally treaties and standards as well as affected community\u2019s unmet needs in Zika complications context.

Campaigners are calling on Latin American governments to rethink their policies on contraception and abortionthat could lead to serious complications and varied degrees of disability later in life.

Further, exploration and investigation of population-based behavioural andecological risk factors or determinants and impacts on the changing and rising emerging infectious disease epidemiologic changes burden at different levels and settings is critical in early warning risk indicators and better innovative health programming to Aedes related Dengue and ZIKV planning, mitigation and prevention programs and strategies. A consortium of Experts used the Bradford Hill\u2019s causality framework assessment that provided ZIKV associated congenital microcephaly and neurological complications consensus reports as a basis for global health response. The basis documented that with the pregnant women affected and foetal abnormalities mostly in the first trimester by the circulating ZIKV infection crossing the placenta and replication in human brain were associated with risk of stillbirth and congenital defects in the Pacific region, The Americas and West Africa [5, 6, 25\u201328]. Likewise, Zika affected countries in the Pacific and the Americas reported temporal association of ZIKV infection preceding the onset of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome or GBS similar to ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013\u20132014, where one in 4000 ZIKV patient developed GBS [17, 18, 26\u201328]. More ZIKV transmission and complications awareness campaign to communities on the risk of Zika, acute and severe consequences alongside effective and reliable psychosocial measures, neuroimaging monitoring and medical-legal approaches in early stage antenatal care is also observed to be crucial in public health preventative measures [4, 6, 27\u201330]. Hence, there is a need that every infant born from pregnancies with possible recent exposure to Zika or primarily Aedes mosquito-borne virus association with brain abnormalities should receive appropriate postnatal imaging and testing for Zika to ensure proper and timely care. Prior adversities have a wealth of insights to share [33] for example, the rubella epidemic congenital syndrome during pregnancy, occurred between 1964 and 1965 in the United States and led to 12.5 million cases. A total of 20,000 children were born with congenital syndrome (11,000 deaf, 3500 blind and 1800 mentally retarded, and 2100 neonatal deaths and more than 11,000 abortions) [33].",

With very scarce access to mental health professionals, shortages in most affected countries can lead to more stigmatization, panic and anxiety stress, depression, to suicidal and other social issues in pregnant women and affected communities.

            "text": "Effective and coordinated response to ZIKV infection and its serious complications is urgently needed to gain a comprehensiveelucidation of public health Zika-related issues for evidence-based improvements on local and global health laws and regulations on the rationale use of pesticide (e.g. aerial insecticide application). Moreover, proactive efforts should be devoted to reducing Aedes linked Zika vulnerability and infections made possible through aggressive public/community awareness, readiness to optimizing integrated vector management (IVM) programs, early ZIKV diagnosis, and counselling and control policies and intervention best practices. Moving forward will require engaging the global community including all stakeholders to advocate and participate in strengthening local and national and global Aedes and ZIKV and other arboviruses surveillance data sharing and public access, defining early-warning indicators for risk communication in public/community engagement, vigilance and resilience. Leveraging on digital technology and service to scale up timely and effective Aedes and ZIKV epidemiologic, entomological and laboratory surveillance, timely Aedes mapping and ZIKV data sharing, and risk communication are imperative in guiding evidence-based ethical, legal and societal practical and acceptable recommendations and guidelines; but also in protecting the life and Rights of most vulnerable populations and communities worldwide. Likewise, sustainable and proportionate operational research and development on innovative approaches and interventions especially safe and efficacious Zika vaccines are urgently needed to support local, regional and global mosquito IVM programs. Just as health workers, medical practitioners and public health experts are working to address key determinants regarding testing, screening, treatment, vaccination and prevention of ZIKV. Equally, lawyers, ethicists, legislators and policy-makers are assessing emerging legal and ethical issues. Legal triage entails prioritization of these issues in real-time to facilitate legitimate rights public health and medical responses by: (1) identifying enabling and disabling issues; (2) gauging changing legal and ethical norms; (3) crafting and explaining innovative solutions; and (4) consistently revisiting the utility and efficacy of legal guidance. Profound reproductive rights issues surround access and use of contraception and abortion, especially among pregnant minors. Many of the nation\u2019s experiencing widespread ZIKV infections have religious foundations and related laws that deeply conflict with these services. Strengthening ZIKV screening recommendations may apply to at-risk groups like infants born to mothers or non-immune traveler with exposure history and or contact (sexual or uncheck blood transfusion) from infected patient from endemic regions. Potential for discrimination arises as mothers (e.g., migrants from Mexico) are targeted for screening. The 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics games in Brazil, Muslims Hajj and Umrah mass-gathering pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia and continued mosquito spread to North America heighten the potential for rapid global extents of ZIKV and other arboviral infections. WHO has expressed disdain for any national travel bans or restrictions? The CDC has issued recommendations and voluntary travel warnings for pregnant women and vulnerable population in affected countries as well as tourists. As seen in response to EVD and SARS, other nations may impose restrictive travel policies on their citizens or attempt to keep out or screen persons arriving from \u201chot spots ZIKV zones\u201d. Furthermore, investing on ZIKV R&D for more sensitive and field or point of care diagnostic for operational population-based screening, especially men and women at reproductive age, fetus and younger children for ZIKV at birth and during the course of development monitoring data sharing programs  in Aedes-prone and affected settings. Conversely, if efficacious treatments for ZIKV infections among infants become a part of the standard of care practices, failures to screen at risk infants may lead to liability later if their disabilities could have been prevented to future Zika safe and effective vaccines for global Zika immunization program.",
