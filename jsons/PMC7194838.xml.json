It contained the Great Trees of London Map, which lists the UK capital's 50 most interesting trees. Did you know there is a giant redwood towering over New Cross Gate tube station? Or a yew in Totteridge that has been there since before the Norman Conquest? I was planning to visit them all. That will now have to wait.",
