            "text": "Human noroviruses (NoVs) infections are considered a significant public health problem, which cause more than 50% of non-bacterial gastroenteritis characterized by fever, vomiting and frequent episodes of diarrhea, especially in adults and children (Ahmed et al. 2014; Kaplan et al. 1982). NoVs are divided into 5 genogroups designated GI through to GV and subdivided into 9 and 22 genotypes, which were first linked to human disease in 1972 (Kroneman et al. 2013; Zheng et al. 2006). From the mid-1990s, Genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) NoV have predominantly occored as outbreaks, which emergence with new variants every two or three years (Ramani et al. 2014). However, since the emergence of the novel Genogroup II, genotype 17 (GII.17) Kawasaki_2014 strain, a new pandemic strain has become predominant in the world. The novel GII.17 not only caused NoVs outbreaks but also spread sporadically with cases reported in China (Shanghai, Taiwan) and USA during the winter of 2014_2015 (Chen et al. 2015; Lee et al. 2015; Parra and Green 2015). From 2015, NoV GII.17 continued to spread to many countries in South America, Europe and Asia (Andrade et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2017; Khamrin et al. 2016). These epidemiological surveys indicated that NoV GII.17 is becoming an important etiological agent of gastroenteritis.",

            "text": "NoVs belongs to the family of Caliciviridae and are nonenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. The genomes are 7.4\u20137.7 kb in size and are typically organized into three open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1 encodes nonstructural proteins, such as the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), while the structural proteins, such as the major and minor capsid protein (VP1 and VP2), are encoded by ORF2 and ORF3, respectively (Glass et al. 2009). VP1 is a 60 KDa protein that can be divided into a shell domain (S domain) and a protruding domain (P domain). The S domain forms a scaffold surrounding the viral RNA and is responsible for the shell structure of the capsid, whereas the P domain contains neutralizing epitopes and binds to the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) receptors, responsible for the genetic variability, builds the viral spikes and facilitates cell attachment (Debbink et al. 2012; Prasad et al. 1999; Tan and Jiang 2005). VP2, a minor capsid protein, exhibit multiple functions, which are observed to stabilize and promote expression of VP1 (Lin et al. 2014).",

Also, the HBGAs-VLPs blocking assay was used as a surrogate method for the evaluation of NoVs neutralization in vitro. HBGAs have been proposed as receptors for NoVs. Due to the different genotypes of NoVs, such as GI.3 and GII.2 did not bind to synthetic or salivary HBGAs, whereas GII.4 could bind to salivary HBGAs (Huo et al. 2015, 2016a). In our study, VLPs from capsid proteins of epidemic NoV GII.17 exhibited broader HBGA recognition, except for blood type O individuals, however, the reason, to explain this phenomenon is unknown. A possible explanation could be sourced from a previously reported study, which found that the recombinant MxV (GII.3) VLPs demonstrated a degree of binding to salivary HBGAs from a blood type A individual (Huang et al. 2005).",
