            "text": "Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in Wuhan, China, and has since spread causing a global pandemic. Various studies have been performed to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral infection for predicting drug repurposing candidates. However, such information is spread across many publications and it is very time-consuming to access, integrate, explore, and exploit. We developed CoVex, the first interactive online platform for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 host interactome exploration and drug (target) identification. CoVex integrates 1) experimentally validated virus-human protein interactions, 2) human protein-protein interactions and 3) drug-target interactions. The web interface allows user-friendly visual exploration of the virus-host interactome and implements systems medicine algorithms for network-based prediction of drugs. Thus, CoVex is an important resource, not only to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 pathogenicity, but also in clinical research for the identification and prioritization of candidate therapeutics. We apply CoVex to investigate recent hypotheses on a systems biology level and to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms driving the virus' life cycle. Furthermore, we extract and discuss drug repurposing candidates involved in these mechanisms. CoVex renders COVID-19 drug research systems-medicine-ready by giving the scientific community direct access to network medicine algorithms integrating virus-host-drug interactions. It is available at https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/covex/ .",

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous research groups around the world have been joining their efforts to identify drugs that can be repurposed to effectively treat COVID-19. Numerous drugs are already part of clinical trials, including remdesivir (a less effective ebola drug), Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine (antimalarial drugs), Tocilizumab (rheumatoid arthritis drug), Favipiravir (influenza drug), and Kaletra (a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir for treating human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1) 7 .",

Few studies on these mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 exist. Gordon et al. applied affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to reconstruct the SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and subsequently employed a chemoinformatics approach to identify potential drugs for repurposing 10 . The data generated from that study is a major advancement in understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, to identify drug candidates, the study mainly considered the direct interactors of the human proteins as putative targets and thus did not take into account the network context of the human interactome. However, viral interactions with human proteins have cascading effects in the human interactome, where key proteins necessary for the viral replication cycle are only indirectly affected. Therefore, downstream host proteins may be additional promising targets for therapeutic intervention but require thorough data integration and mining to be identified (see Supplementary Material for details). Figure 1 illustrates the concept of systems medicine-based drug repurposing specifically for SARS-CoV-2.",

Furthermore, network medicine analysis was applied to compile a list of drug repurposing candidates that target also indirectly affected proteins in the human interactome. However, the combined number of virus-host, host-host and drug-target interactions goes into the millions such that purely algorithmic approaches to discovering new drug targets and drug repurposing candidates produces a large number of results, many of which lack mechanistic specificity and, hence, are not useful. Thus, to make their results accessible, Gysi et al. worked closely together with clinical experts to narrow down the number of predicted repurposable drugs. Most antiviral drugs (grey) target the virus proteins or their direct host interactor proteins to inhibit different stages of the viral life cycle. Our rationale, however, is that viral interactions with human host proteins have a cascading effect to hijack and control key proteins necessary for the virus' life cycle. We aim to identify repurposable drug candidates (green) targeting these key host modulators to interfere with virus replication and disease progression following infection. Besides an increased antiviral drug repertoire, targeting host proteins would make it more difficult for the virus (population) to develop resistance mutations.",

CoVex offers two main actions for which several network medicine algorithms are available: Given a list of user-selected human host proteins, viral proteins, or drugs (referred to as seeds), users can (1) search the human interactome for viable drug targets and (2) identify repurposable drug candidates. In a typical work-flow, these two actions are combined, i.e. starting from a selection of virus or virus-interacting proteins, users mine the interactome for suitable drug targets for which, in turn, suitable drugs are identified. Additionally, users can leverage expert knowledge by uploading a list of proteins or drugs of interest as seeds to guide the analysis. Such seeds could, for instance, be a list of differentially expressed genes, a list of proteins related to a molecular mechanism of interest, or a set of drugs known to be effective.",

In this scenario, we are specifically interested in viral proteins that suppress host immunity and the corresponding host immune response pathways. First, we select the viral proteins ORF7a and ORF3a, which are potentially involved in innate immune response and apoptosis as discussed in Gordon et al. (2020) 10 . Next, we compile a list of proteins of interest based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the study by Blanco-Melo et al. (2020) 36 lung epithelial cells were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to altered expression of immunity-related genes to combat the viral infection. We consider DEGs known to be associated with the host pathway involving infection with the Herpes simplex virus (HSV), another viral pathogen. These genes include IFIH1 , OAS1 , STAT1 , DDX58 , OAS2 , OAS3 , IRF7 , EIF2AK2 , IFIT1 , and IRF9 . The selected viral proteins and DEGs (converted to Uniprot ids) were used as seeds for the multi-Steinert tree algorithm to extract a potential immune-related mechanism. As expected, the resulting subnetwork reveals that the viral proteins are close to the DEGs in the host PPI network. Closeness centrality analysis assigned a high rank to Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib, which are currently being assessed in clinical trials. Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib exert immunomodulatory effects as Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors 37, 38 . Thus, administration with these drugs may mitigate immune-mediated lung injury and reduce functional deterioration caused by an over-amplified host inflammatory response. This could be especially important in later stages of the disease to prevent an overreaction of the body's immune system and, hence, may further prevent the need for mechanical ventilation in patients suffering from severe COVID-19. Other drugs that target this subnetwork include Masitinib, Erlotinib, and Sorafenib, which could be further examined in downstream analyses. In a similar manner, users may provide a custom list of proteins as seeds to hunt for drugs that can target a putative mechanism of interest.",

We further select the interactors of the immune-related viral proteins ORF9B, ORF6, ORF3B, and ORF3A 10 as end-point seeds. By applying the multi-Steiner tree algorithm, we discover pathways of interacting proteins that connect the selected drugs (and their target proteins) with the selected viral proteins.

As an application case, we follow up on a recently published hypothesis by Liu and Abrahams concerning the putative interference of SARS-CoV-2 with the formation of hemoglobin in erythrocytes 42, 43 . Essentially, the virus is believed to interfere with heme formation causing symptoms of hypoxia. Liu and Abrahams hypothesize that this would also explain why Chloroquine and Favipiravir are effective drugs, as they may prevent the viral proteins from competing with iron for the porphyrin in hemoglobin (NSP1-16, ORF3a, ORF10, and ORF8 targeted by Chloroquine as well as ORF7a targeted by Favipiravir). Based on this hypothesis (discussed in more detail in the Supplementary Material), we investigate the pathways connecting these viral proteins with the two effective drugs Chloroquine and Favipiravir. To this end, we select two known heme binding host proteins as seeds: Cytochrome b5 reductase, which interacts with the viral protein NSP7, and the viral ORF3a, which binds to Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1). Using KeyPathwayMiner for drug target discovery followed by Closeness Centrality for drug discovery, we identify methylene blue in addition to Chloroquine and Deferoxamine, which are both in COVID-19 clinical trials 44, 45 . Notably, Methylene blue is approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia, which fits the investigated hypothesis (reduced oxygen-carrying capacity). Also, Deferoxamine is widely used therapeutically as a chelator of ferric ions in disorders of iron overload 46 . However, note that the available scientific evidence for a methemoglobinemia or ferric ion imbalance caused by SARS-CoV-2 is very limited (see Supplementary Material) and that we use this hypothesis solely to illustrate the potential of CoVex' network medicine investigation and hypothesis testing capabilities.",

Much attention in biomedical and clinical research is, thus, given to the task of identifying therapeutically exploitable drugs. A particular interest lies in drug repurposing, since already approved drugs can go through shortened clinical trials within months rather than years. While a number of promising drug repurposing candidates are currently being tested, the discovery of such candidates is still unstandardized and mostly unstructured. Systems and network medicine offer alternative approaches, where the process of drug target discovery is driven by computational data mining methods utilizing molecular interaction networks. As recently demonstrated by Gysi et al. for SARS-CoV-2, this data-driven process can produce a list of promising drug candidates targeting host proteins in close proximity and mechanistically related to virus-interacting proteins 11 . Here, we seek to make this network medicine approach widely available to the community.",

Therefore, \"trust\" flows less easily to the hubs, which implies that they obtain a lower score.

The damping factor controls how easily \"trust\" can flow to nodes which are far 0, ] d \u2208 [ 1 d away from the seeds. The larger , the higher scores distant nodes receive.

In this case, CoVex allows the identification of the mechanism behind the drugs currently considered for treating currently considered for treating COVID-19. Application scenario b -Candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 can be identified starting from a user-defined set of seeds comprising differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and viral proteins. Such a custom list can be obtained from other datasets, such as experiments and/or literature. One possible strategy is to use proteins known to be associated with a specific biological process, such as SARS-CoV-2 proteins involved in viral pathogenesis and host proteins that participate in the corresponding host immune response to infection. This way, we use the host PPI network to connect the viral proteins to the DEGs and obtain a potential mechanism that can be targeted using repurposable drugs. To obtain a custom list of DEGs, raw counts from the gene expression data of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial A549 cells relative to mock-treated cells were obtained from Blanco-Melo et al. 13 (GEO accession GSE147507). Differential expression analysis using the edgeR (v.3.26.8) package (fold change \u2265 2, adjusted p-value <0.05) was performed to obtain a list of DEGs. To identify host cell pathways enriched in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, KEGG enrichment was performed using the gseapy ( v.0.9.15 ) package. Enriched KEGG terms included pathways that are known to be involved in immune response to pathogens, such as \"Influenza A\", \"Herpes simplex infection\", \"Measles\", and \"Hepatitis C\".",

The enriched DEGs include IFIH1 , OAS1 , STAT1 , DDX58 , OAS2 , OAS3 , IRF7 , EIF2AK2 , IFIT1 , and IRF9 . We then use both the viral proteins and DEGs as seeds for the multi-Steiner tree algorithm to extract a subnetwork that is relevant to our pathway of interest, shown in Figure S4 . Next, we use closeness centrality on the resulting subnetwork to obtain drugs. The parameters used to run the multi-Steiner tree and closeness centrality algorithms can be found in Table S2 . Top-ranking drugs included Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib, which are currently being assessed in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 ( Figure S5 ). Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib are both known to inhibit Janus kinase (Jak), which promote cytokine signaling 14, 15 . Thus, administration with these drugs can mitigate immune-mediated lung injury and prevent functional functional deterioration in COVID-19 patients caused by an over-amplified host immune response. As shown in Figure S5 , other drugs that target this subnetwork include Masitinib, Erlotinib, and Sorafenib, which could be further examined in downstream analyses. In a similar manner, users can provide a custom list of proteins to retrieve drugs that can target their mechanism of interest, followed by careful examination of the results. Application scenario c -Another approach to find candidate drugs to combat COVID-19 is to connect the targets of promising drugs which are already in clinical trials to the viral proteins. We can identify the candidate mechanisms by extracting the sub-network(s) connecting these two ends with a minimum number of intermediate connector proteins.

Essentially, we follow the idea that the virus could interfere with porphyrin, which is a substrate, together with iron (Fe 2+ ) ions, during the synthesis of the heme prosthetic group in hemoglobin. The viral proteins thus hinder the interaction of iron with porphyrin, as the viral proteins are hypothesized to compete with iron for the porphyrin and thus to inhibit heme group synthesis, leading to hypoxia symptoms 24 . Liu and Abrahams suggest that this might explain why Chloroquine and Favipiravir are effective drugs, as they may prevent the virus from competing with iron for the porphyrin: Chloroquine by interfering with the viral proteins NSP1-16, ORF3a, and ORF10 which may bind the porphyrin to prevent heme synthesis, and also by inhibiting the binding of viral protein ORF8 to porphyrins \"to a certain extent\" 24 . Favipiravir could prohibit ORF7a from binding to (free) porphyrin in addition to preventing the virus from entering the host cells 24 .",

In CoVex, we selected the viral proteins NSP1-16, ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8 and ORF10 as seeds and expanded the network to all of their host partner proteins. Notably, we see that NSP7 may bind to Cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R), which converts methemoglobin to hemoglobin (oxygen-transporting Fe 2+ hemoglobin to non-oxygen-transporting Fe 3+ hemoglobin). Cytochrome b5 reductase is involved in the transfer of reducing equivalents from the physiological electron donor, NADH, via an FAD domain to the small molecules of cytochrome b5. It is also heavily involved in many oxidation and reduction reactions, such as the reduction of methemoglobin to hemoglobin [25] [26] [27] . In addition, we see that ORF3a binds to HMOX1 (Heme oxygenase 1), which might lead to interference with heme degradation. We continued with all 238 host interactors as new seeds and executed KeyPathwayMiner (Table  S4 ) to investigate the host interactome for proteins that connect the selected virus-host interactions proteins. We discovered five new drug targets (the proteins APP, XPO1, TRIM25, HSCB, FBXO6) for which we extracted 20 drug candidates using the closeness centrality measure and only screening for currently approved drugs. In the resulting ranked list, we rediscovered Chloroquine as well as Deferoxamine, both of which are currently in clinical trial or discussed in the literature as candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment. Note that Deferoxamine is widely used for the treatment of Thalassemia and as a chelator of ferric ion in disorders of iron overload 28 . In addition to these two drugs, we find Methylene blue, a drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of methemoglobinemia. Note that the evidence for a methemoglobinemia caused by SARS-CoV-2 is anecdotal (no reports on abnormal methemoglobin levels, iron metabolism markers, etc. exist) and we used this hypothesis to illustrate a potential hybrid level starting point for the network medicine investigation of a hypothesis using CoVex.
