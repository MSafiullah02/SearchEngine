            "text": "Despite the potential to infect a wide variety of animal species, influenza A viruses are generally host-specific and are not readily transmissible from one species to another. Several factors (e.g., environmental, viral, and host factors) can affect or determine the ability of influenza viruses to transmit efficiently from one host to another (Fig. 1). While the molecular basis for host range restriction has not yet been clearly defined, the factors governing this function have frequently been linked to the viral surface glycoproteins, particularly HA, and their interaction with sialic acid receptors on host epithelial cells.7\n8\n9 Influenza virus infection is initiated via HA, which binds to sialic acid-containing glycans that are associated with glycoproteins and glycolipids on the surface of epithelial cells. The HAs of human influenza virus strains preferentially bind to oligosaccharides that terminate with sialic acid linked to galactose by \u03b1(2,6) linkages (Sia [\u03b12,6]Gal), whereas the HAs of avian influenza virus strains prefer oligosaccharides that terminate with a sialic acid linked to galactose by \u03b1(2,3) linkages (Sia [\u03b12,3]Gal).10\n11 The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of HA is located in a globular head domain formed by the 190 helix at the top of HA, the 220 loop at the edge of the globular head, and the 130 loop at the other edge of the globular head.12 Amino acid changes in and around the RBD dramatically alter the receptor binding preference of influenza viruses, which help define virus transmission. However, the specific amino acids that determine receptor-binding specificity vary among the different HA subtypes. Regardless, mutations in the 220 loop may alter the orientation of this loop and thus, optimize the contact with specific receptor types13 to facilitate the release of virus particles from infected host cells. In addition, the NA protein is also likely to contribute to viral transmissibility13\n14 and it was recently reported that an optimal balance between HA and NA activities is critical for efficient respiratory droplet transmission of a pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus in ferrets.15 Beyond HA and NA, additional viral proteins have been examined for their contributing roles in influenza virus transmission. For example, amino acid residues in the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) protein are associated with mammalian adaptation, efficient transmission via respiratory droplets between ferrets, and replication in human cells.7\n16\n17 It is also worth mentioning that along with other segments, the PB1 genes of the human pandemic viruses in 1957 (Asian flu, H2N2) and 1968 (Hong Kong flu, H3N2) came from avian virus sources.18 Therefore, acquisition of the avian PB1 gene was speculated to be a crucial factor in the emergence of reassortants with a competitive advantage over seasonal influenza viruses with regard to replication and virulence.19 Aside from differences in the genetic makeup of viruses, the immunological history of the host can also impact an individual's susceptibility to infection, as well as the potential for immune control of virus infection and subsequent disease outcome.20 Collectively, these features account for the virulence, expansion of host range, and interspecies transmission of AIVs.",

            "text": "Distinct features of the HA protein control not only the species specificity of the virus, but also its tissue specificity and therefore its ability to spread within a host. Different lineages of viruses have become stably adapted to avian and mammalian species through diverse receptor preferences, for example, AIVs recognize specific sialic acid receptors of susceptible cells lining the intestinal gut of avian hosts.23 However, specific amino acid substitutions in HA generated through repeated adaptation can shift receptor recognition, which, in turn, effectively switches binding preferences to receptors expressed by mammalian hosts including humans. Further genetic modification of the HA cleavage motif of some subtypes (e.g., H5 and H7) can result in an HA that is more readily cleaved by ubiquitous cellular proteases.24 It should be noted that these genetic alterations were observed during novel host adaption. For example, during consecutive passages in chickens, a highly virulent AIV was isolated from a virulent-swan virus that normally replicates poorly in chickens. The more virulent chicken strain was associated with accumulation of polybasic residues in HA cleavage sites,7 which is typically seen among highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 and H7 viruses and promotes efficient biological activation facilitating growth in various organs outside the respiratory tract.24\n25\n",

Since its first appearance in Guangdong, China in 1996, this virus has already spawned various clusters of antigenically divergent HPAI H5 lineages that spread widely in Asia toward Europe and Africa26 causing devastating poultry outbreaks. In humans, more than 640 HPAI A/H5N1 infections have been reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 1997, of which \u223c60% were fatal.6 This high mortality rate may be related to aberrant innate immune responses, which were found to correlate with the atypical virulence of the high mortality HPAI A/H5N1.6\n27\n28\n29 In 2014, new cases were reported in Asia with Vietnam and Cambodia recording fatalities during the year.6 The first imported case in North America was also recently confirmed in a resident of Alberta, Canada who returned from Beijing, China in December 27, 2013, was hospitalized, and died within a few days due to viral infection.30 At present, there are no imminent indications that contemporary HPAI A/H5N1 viruses have the capacity to support efficient, sustained viral transmission in humans.

In contrast to these LPAI H7 strains,45 HPAI A/H7N3 variants were responsible for zoonotic infections among poultry workers in British Columbia, Canada,46 and Jalisco, Mexico.47 Before 2013, the largest human H7 outbreak occurred in 2003 in the Netherlands48 and was caused by an HPAI A/H7N7 virus, involved over 80 human cases including one fatality, and was associated with the destruction of more than 30 million birds. Although the number of human cases during this outbreak was quite high, only three cases were individuals who had not been in contact with infected poultry, suggesting that human-to-human transmission of HPAI A/H7N7 was quite limited. Furthermore, with the exception of the cases in the United States, most H7 patients have generally presented with mild respiratory disease commonly accompanied by conjunctivitis.39\n",

            "text": "However, the pathobiology of H7 AIVs changed when human cases caused by A/H7N9 viruses emerged after late March 2013.49 As of March 9th, 2015, there have been 631 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with the A/H7N9 virus reported to the WHO with more than 36% mortality including 4 cases in Taipei, 13 cases in Hong Kong SAR, 1 case in a Chinese traveler reported from Malaysia, and 2 cases in Canadian citizens who traveled to China.50 In contrast to the A/H5N1 and A/H9N2 AIVs, A/H7N9 replicates efficiently in poultry without inducing remarkable influenza-like disease.51\n52 The product of multiple reassortment events, this virus includes an HA gene that may have originated from AIVs of duck origin and an NA gene that may have transferred from migratory birds, while the internal genes originated from prevailing A/H9N2 viruses in Chinese poultry53 (Fig. 2). While the A/H7N9 AIV does not contain a pathotypic HA cleavage motif, suggesting that these viruses are of low pathogenicity in avian species, it can infect and replicate well in mammalian species due to receptor binding site mutations.51\n52 This has important public health implications since viruses with low pathogenicity are able to spread in domestic poultry undetected. Thus, in contrast to HPAI A/H5 and A/H7 AIVs, which kill infected birds rapidly, A/H7N9 has the potential to cause silent epidemics and outbreaks resulting in sporadic infections in humans who come into direct contact with infected birds. Notably, human infections with A/H7N9 viruses have been characterized by rapid progression to severe pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome, reminiscent of human HPAI A/H5N1 disease.51\n52\n53 Although there is not yet any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission,52\n54\n55 the scale of these zoonotic infections highlights the need for enhanced surveillance. Moreover, the geographic location of many Asian countries puts them well within the East Asian flyway of migratory waterfowls, enhancing the likelihood of spread. In addition, an increase in Chinese tourism due to improved air travel could also contribute to global spread of viruses. Thus, the potential exists for A/H7N9 to be carried by infected migratory wild birds and/or human travelers as in cases reported in Taiwan, Malaysia, and Canada.56\n57\n",

Nonstructural protein 1 appears to contribute to the efficient replication of human influenza A viruses (i.e., 1918 pandemic virus) and is a virulence determinant of HPAI H5N1 viruses that acts by restricting the induction of the host interferon response.80 Additionally, the viral polymerase genes also play significant roles in adaptation and pathogenesis. Of the identified molecular markers of virulence in the viral polymerases, a glutamic acid (E)-to-lysine (K) alteration at position 627 in PB2 is perhaps most commonly observed, particularly among HPAI H5N1 and H7 viruses.7\n81 In the absence of 627K, the aspartic acid (D)-to-asparagine (N) alteration at residue 701 of the PB2 protein has been shown to similarly enhance growth and transmission in guinea pigs17 and to expand the host range of avian H5N1 viruses to mice and humans.16\n17 In addition, the expression of the PB1-F2 protein, which is associated with mitochondrial targeting, membrane disruption, and subsequent apoptosis, was suggested to contribute to virulence.82\n83 Mutations in the polymerase genes of highly pathogenic viruses, such as the E627K mutation of the PB2 protein and the N66S mutation of the PB1-F2 protein, have been associated with an impaired adaptive immune response and increased host cell apoptosis, which may contribute to enhanced viral replication and extrapulmonary spread. Beside the viral virulence factor of described previously, host factors are also responsible for the pathogenesis of AIV infection. Therefore, comprehensive understanding of how virus pathogenesis is mediated by various viral or host factors could propose the clue for rapid detection of next pandemic potentials AIVs and the development of new therapies.",

Furthermore, the use of a single model to evaluate both pathogenicity and transmissibility has resulted in a fuller understanding of the capacity of influenza viruses to cause disease. Mice are among the most commonly used mammalian models for evaluating influenza infection and offer many advantages over other laboratory species including low cost and the broad availability of reagents and of transgenic mice with targeted gene disruptions39\n77 (1\n2\n3). Moreover, cells in the respiratory tract of commonly used laboratory strains of mice express both SAa2,6 and SAa2,3 receptors, making them susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses. The parameter most commonly used for measuring influenza virus disease in mice is weight loss (20\u201325% decrease in body weight generally requires euthanasia). In addition, blood oxygen saturation (Sa02) can be used as a metric of disease severity, as decreases correlate with increases in viral replication.84 In addition, measuring viral titers in the respiratory tissues is critical since even modest reductions in viral load can be associated with profound differences in lethality. Unfortunately, most human influenza strains do not replicate efficiently in mice without prior virus adaptation, thereby limiting the utility of the mouse model. Furthermore, many clinical signs of influenza virus infection in humans are not present in mice, and they are a poor model for virus transmission.85\n",

Human and avian influenza viruses replicate efficiently in the respiratory tract of ferrets without prior adaptation, and following infection with some highly pathogenic viruses, extrapulmonary spread of virus can result.92 Unlike other small mammalian models, numerous clinical signs found in humans following seasonal or avian influenza virus infection are present in the ferret following experimental inoculation with these strains through the intranasal route (Table 3). Elevated body temperatures are detected as early as 1 day postinoculation, and more virulent viruses generally elicit high fevers that can persist for several days.93\n94 Nasal discharge and sneezing are also frequently observed in infected ferrets up to 1 week postinoculation with sneezing detected more frequently following seasonal influenza virus infection.95 Additionally, transmission models have been established using the ferret to measure the capacity of influenza viruses to spread to na\u00efve contact ferrets in the presence of direct contact (i.e., pair-housing an infected and a na\u00efve ferret) or by the spread of respiratory droplets in the absence of direct contact (i.e., separating infected and na\u00efve ferrets with a perforated wall to allow air exchange only).95\n96\n97 Successful virus transmission is detected by testing contact ferrets for the presence of virus in nasal secretions and seroconversion at the end of the observation period. Daily clinical assessment of inoculated and contact ferrets further provides additional means to evaluate the effects of virus infection and transmission effectiveness. The most commonly used animal species for viral pathogenesis and antiviral drug screening of AIVs are the laboratory mouse, the ferret, and the cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis).22 In addition, ferrets and guinea pigs are used in influenza transmission studies. However, each animal model has its advantages and disadvantages in a particular purpose. Therefore, we should be considered in relation to the research question concerned to select the proper animal model.",

It is noteworthy that following the initial outbreaks, A(H7N9) underwent further reassortment with local avian A/H9N2 strains in mainland China, an event which may have caused the sudden increase in human cases seen in early 2014.98 As of March 2015, there have been 631 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with A/H7N9. In contrast, HPAI A/H5N1 viruses took more than 5 years to attain a similar number of cases. In addition, unlike HPAI A/H5N1 viruses, which cause almost 100% mortality in affected poultry, A/H7N9 and H10N6 do not cause obvious symptoms in poultry thereby increasing the difficulty of virus tracking and surveillance. Moreover, the enzootic cocirculation of A/H5N1, A/H9N2, and A/H7N9 viruses has given rise to many novel reassortants with other viruses such as H10N8,61 H10N6,99 H5N8,100 H5N6,101 and H7N6.102 The possibility that the continued circulation of these viruses will result in the generation of more virulent and human-transmissible variants, however remote at the moment, is likely under the right conditions and with appropriate hosts. Collectively, these concerns highlight the importance of continued worldwide virus monitoring and surveillance in human and animal populations alike. It should be noted that AIV infections differ from human influenza infections in many ways, including method of viral transmission, viral dissemination, clinical features, pathogenesis, and host response. Understanding the molecular determinants of these differences through careful in vitro experiments and the use of appropriate animal models may help to identify the reassortant viruses with the highest potential to cause future pandemics.",
