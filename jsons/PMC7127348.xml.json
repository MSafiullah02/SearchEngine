Two large replicative polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa), are coded in the genome as precursor proteins to yield functional proteins.4, 5, 6 Among the functional proteins, a 3C-like cysteine protease (SARS 3CLpro) processes the polyprotein to produce itself as well as a variety of proteins necessary to re-construct the virus particles. Thus, SARS 3CLpro is thought to be an ideal target for anti-SARS agents. Numerous studies on SARS 3CLpro inhibitors have been reported,7, 8 but no therapeutic agents are available at present.",

The distance between the 2-position carbon atom of the cyclohexyl-ring and \u03b1-nitrogen atom of cyclohexylalanine (Cha) was 3.48 \u00c5 (Fig. 1\n). This result suggested that the cyclohexyl ring may be connected to the peptide chain via a methylene linker, yielding a new inhibitor scaffold containing a hydrophobic decahydroisoquinoline ring. The resulting decahydroisoquinoline inhibitor (2) showed inhibitory activity as expected, but with moderate potency (IC50 = 63 \u03bcM).11 Analysis of the X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor 2 complexed with R188I SARS 3CLpro revealed the lack of interactions with the P3 to P4 sites in substrate-based inhibitor 1.",

The synthesis of the requisite oxygen-containing precursor used in the ring-closing reaction can be achieved using established stereo-selective reactions such as the Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation and Sharpless dihydroxylation reaction. In addition, the effect of the substituent at the 1-position in the fused-ring system of 3 may also be evaluated; the effects of different substituents in this position have not been assessed in our previous studies using the decahydroisoquinoline scaffold in 2.12 Thus, inhibitors containing an octahydroisochromene scaffold with four different substituents at the 1-position were designed and synthesized.",

Monoprotection of diol 8 using tert-butyl diphenylsilyl chloride (TBDPSCl) followed by oxidation of the unprotected alcohol in the resulting product via a Ley-Griffith oxidation reaction using tetrapropyl ammonium perruthenate (TPAP) gave the corresponding aldehyde. The product was used with any purification, and reacted with (methoxymethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride to give 9. The methoxyvinyl group in 9 was then converted to the corresponding aldehyde upon treatment with 10-camphorsulfonic acid. The isolated aldehyde was reacted with methyl triphenylphosphonium chloride to yield a terminal olefin. The TBDPS group in the product was then removed upon treatment with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to give 10. The primary alcohol in 10 was oxidized via a Ley\u2013Griffith oxidation reaction and the resulting aldehyde homologated using a Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons (HWE) reaction upon reaction with ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acetate to give 11. The ethyl ester in 11 was reduced with diisobutyl aluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) and the resulting allylic alcohol stereo-specifically oxidized via a Sharpless\u2013Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in the presence of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and (S, S)-diethyltartrate ((\u2013)-DET) to yield 12 as a single diastereomer. The terminal olefin in 12 was then oxidized via a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction using potassium osmate (VI) dehydrate (K2OsO2(OH)4) and potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) in the presence of hydroquinine (anthraquinone-1,4-diyl) diether ((DHQ)2AQN). The formation of the expected diol was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy with the simultaneous production of a small amount of the cyclized product (13) formed via the nucleophilic addition of the resulting alcohol. Thus, the mixture was treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid without any further purification to convert the remaining dihydroxylated product into the desired cyclized product (13). However, whether product 13 was formed as a single diasteroisomer or an inseparable mixture of diastereomers could not be determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Thus, the product was converted into the final products containing different substituents at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold to evaluate whether the fused ring structure would function as a novel inhibitor scaffold.",

Since it was unclear whether key intermediate 13 used for the above syntheses was formed as a single diastereomer or an inseparable mixture of diastereoisomers using 1H NMR spectroscopy, the 13C NMR spectrum of 13 was examined and two signals were detected for the methine carbon atom neighboring an oxygen atom in the octahydroisochromene scaffold (Fig. S-1). This result strongly suggests that triol 13 obtained using the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction using (DHQ)2AQN as a ligand was formed as a 1.5:1 diastereoisomeric mixture (Scheme 2 and entry 1 in Table 2\n). Thus, the reaction conditions used in the asymmetric dihydroxylation were evaluated focusing on the chiral ligand, a key factor in the stereo-selectivity of the reaction.16 Precursor 12 was treated with K2OsO2(OH)4 and K3Fe(CN)6 with or without the chiral ligand as stated above (Scheme 2) and the products immediately converted into triol 13 upon treatment with p-toluenesulfonic acid. The diastereoisomeric ratio of the products was estimated using the methine carbon atom signal in the 13C NMR spectrum. Table 2 shows that in the absence of the chiral ligand, an equal amount of both the possible diastereomers was obtained (entry 4). A slight preference for one diastereomer was observed when hydroquinine (anthraquinone-1,4-diyl) diether ((DHQ)2AQN) was used as the chiral ligand, as in Scheme 2 (Table 2, entry 1). In contrast, a much better preference for one diastereoisomer was observed when 1,4-bis(dihydroquinine)phthalazine ((DHQ)2PHAL) or hydroquinidine-2,5-diphenyl-4,6-pyrimidinediyl diether ((DHQ)2Pyr) was used as the chiral ligand. (DHQ)2Pyr (entry 3) showed a slightly better diastereoisomeric ratio (dr = 7:1) than (DHQ)2PHAL (entry 2, dr = 6:1), which made it technically feasible to isolate the major product. As expected, the diastereoisomeric ratio was inverted when hydroquinidine-2,5-diphenyl-4,6-pyrimidinediyl diether ((DHQD)2Pyr) was used as the chiral ligand (entry 5, dr = 1:15).",

In the 1H NMR spectrum of the major product, a nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) was observed between the protons at the 1- and 3-positions of the octahydroisochromene ring and between the protons at the 3-positon and bridgehead \u03b1-position, which indicates that these protons adopt a cis-\u03b1-configuration (Fig. S-1a). The coupling constant between the proton at the 1-position and the neighboring proton of the secondary alcohol was observed to be 9.7 Hz, which also indicates the cis-configuration of the protons. Taken together, it was estimated that the configuration of the major product was (1-S, 3-R) 13a, as shown in Table 1.17 Although the confirmed structure of 13a was the opposite to that expected for the asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction, it has been occasionally reported depending on the substrate used.18, 19 In this specific substrate, steric hindrance due to the epoxy alcohol interferes with the ordinary interactions with the chiral ligand to direct attack of potassium osmate to the terminal olefin from the less sterically hindered face (Fig. S-1c).",

The IC50 value of 16a was estimated from the sigmoidal plot obtained from the decrease in the digested substrate (Fig. S-2). However, the as-obtained IC50 value (Table 1) was an approximate value and only indicated the inhibition tendency because the obtained plot was not well fitted to the expected sigmoidal curve due to the presence of only 40% of the desired diastereomer (derived from the diastereo-isomeric mixture of 13, dr = 1.5:1). Compound 16b and 16d showed ~50% inhibition at 400 \u03bcM and 16d showed weak inhibition even at 1600 \u03bcM. In spite of these vague results, they strongly suggest that the octahydroisochromene ring functions as a novel hydrophobic scaffold in the SARS 3CLpro inhibitor. It was also expected that a medium size linear alkyl group at the 1-position, such as n-butyl in 16a, can interact with SARS 3CLpro at a specific site, but bulkier substituents such as the branched group in 16c or planar groups in 16b and 16d exhibit less interactions.",

The warhead aldehyde was also directed toward the active center of the protease, as-observed in the case of the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor (Fig. 3a). In addition, the n-butyl substituent at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold in 3b was assumed to be situated on the surface of the protease near the S1\u2032 to S2\u2032 pockets (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the docking mode for less potent inhibitor 3c (IC50 = 780 \u03bcM) showed different interactions at the P1 site imidazole and aldehyde warhead at the active center of the protease, although the interactions with the fused-ring system were expected to be similar to 3b (Fig. 3c). The interactions with the n-butyl substituent at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold in 3c were different from those of inhibitor 3b. The different modes of interaction observed for 3b and 3c were derived from the change in the configuration of the octahydroisochromene scaffold, which caused an 88% decrease in the inhibitory activity.

In contrast, the diastereoisomeric mixtures of 16b, 16c and 16d, which contain bulky or planar substituents at the 1-position, showed lower inhibitory activity. These results strongly suggested the functionality of the octahydroisochromene as a core hydrophobic scaffold for the S2 pocket of the protease and the additional interactions formed between the 1-position of the scaffold when the substituent is a linear alkyl group of moderate size. Based on these positive findings, the effects of the stereochemistry of the octahydroisochromene scaffold were examined and the results suggest that a specific configuration of the octahydroisochromene, (1S, 3S) 3b, directed the P1 site imidazole and the warhead aldehyde to their counterpart pockets in the protease. In addition, the n-butyl substituent at 1-position of the fused-ring system in 3b was also expected to form some interactions with the protease. In contrast, these functional groups in the enantiomeric octahydroisochromene inhibitor, (1R, 3R) 3c, were probably misdirected causing an 88% decrease in the inhibitory activity. Thus, detailed analysis of these interactions based on X-ray crystal analysis of 3b complexed with R188I SARS 3CLpro to optimize the substituent at the 1-position as well as an alternative warhead group are ongoing in our laboratory.",
