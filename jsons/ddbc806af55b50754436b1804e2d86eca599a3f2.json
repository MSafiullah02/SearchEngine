            "text": "Two cDNAs encoding different acetylcholinesterase (AChE) genes (AdAce1 and AdAce2) were sequenced and analyzed from the lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus. Both AdAce1 and AdAce2 were highly similar (95 and 93% amino acid identity, respectively) with the Ace genes of Tribolium castaneum. Both AdAce1 and AdAce2 have the conserved residues characteristic of AChE (catalytic triad, intra-disulfide bonds, and so on). Partial cDNA sequences of the Alphitobius Ace genes were compared between two tetrachlorvinphos resistant (Kennebec and Waycross) and one susceptible strain of beetles. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, but only one non-synonymous mutation was found (A271S in AdAce2). No SNPs were exclusively found in the resistant strains, the A271S mutation does not correspond to any mutations previously reported to alter sensitivity of AChE to organophosphates or carbamates, and the A271S was found only as a heterozygote in one individual from one of the resistant A. diaperinus strains. This suggests that tetrachlorvinphos resistance in the Kennebec and Waycross strains of A. diaperinus is not due to mutations in either AChE gene. The sequences of AdAce1 and AdAce2 provide new information about the evolution of these important genes in insects. Arch Insect Biochem Physiol. 67: 130-138, 2008. ",

High beetle populations consume significant amounts of bird feed (Savage, 1992) . Under dry conditions in the broiler house, beetles bite the skin of birds resting at night. To prevent these bites, birds will rest for short periods and then move (Despins et al., 1987; Vaughan and Turner, 1984) . This can affect the weight gain of chicks.",

Recent studies have discovered Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology March 2008 that some insect species have a single Ace gene (Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica), while many other species have two Ace genes (Culex pipiens, Bombyx mori, Myzus persicae, among others). Beetles (Coleoptera) are the most evolutionarily successful metazoans, contributing 25% of all known animal species, far more than any other taxonomic order. Despite the diversity and economic importance of Coleoptera, Ace genes have been reported from only two beetles: Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Zhu et al., 1996) and Tribolium castaneum (http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc/edu/projects/ tribolium/). Evidence has accumulated that indicates a limited number of mutations in Ace are as- Fig. 1 . The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of AdAce1 (Drosophila Ace orthologous) cDNA (Accession no. EU086056). The residues that make intra-disulfide bonds are marked with *, oxianion hole with \u00a7, catalytic triad with +, acyl binding site with \u00b6, and anionic subsite with \u2021. The locations of the primers used for genotyping are indicated as **. sociated with resistance (i.e., mutations that code for an organophosphate and/or carbamate insensitive AChE) in insects (Fournier, 2005; Kono and Tomita, 2006; Oh et al., 2006) . In this study we examined if there was one or two Ace genes in A. diaperinus, and if mutations in Ace could be correlated with tetrachlorvinphos resistance.",

We could not unambiguously identify the translation start site because no stop codon was found in frame in the 5\u2032 upstream region. If this transcript is similar in size to the Ace gene in the Colorado potato beetle, L. decemlineata (Zhu and Clark, 1995) , it will be more than 13 kb in size. However, AdAce1 has an initiation codon that is identical to the one tentatively identified in L. decemlineata. Given that AdAce1 does not have any of the mutations associated with organophosphate and/or carbamate resistance in Drosophila (Mutero et al., 1994) , Lucilia cuprina (Chen et al., 2001) , or M. domestica AChEs (Kim et al., 2003; Kozaki et al., 2001; Walsh et al., 2001) , we conclude that AdAce1 encodes an organophosphate-sensitive AChE (characterized by M126, V205, G287, F352, and G390). This is consistent with the Denmark-S strain being insecticide susceptible.",

We were unable to complete the 5\u2032-RACE for AdAce2, although we tried multiple variations of the protocol given by the manufacturer, including increased or decreased cation concentration, increasing the viscosity of the reaction mix by BSA or by using an alternative cation (Mg2 + to Mn 2+ ). The alignment of this gene with the Drosophila Ace paralogous AChEs showed that, as expected for an insecticide-susceptible strain, beetles from the Denmark-S strain had an organophosphate and carbamate sensitive type.",

As expected, the Ace orthologous sequences of the two Tenebrionidae, A. diaperinus and T. castaneum, were more similar to each other than to the Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Fig. 4) . These three coleopteran sequences differed primarily at the N-and C-terminal regions, but showed expected conservation at most functionally important residues. Similarly, the Ace paralogous sequences from A. diaperinus and T. castaneum were highly similar, with the greatest number of differences found in the C-terminal region (Fig. 5) .The phylogenic tree of the Arthropod AChEs (Fig. 3) shows there are two major groups, with the Acari AChEs being intermediates. Each group is further divided into the subgroups, primarily by Order. AdAce1 and AdAce2 clustered with the other Coleoptera genes in both. This is consistent with the idea that beetles have two Ace genes. The mutations related to organophosphate resistance were first studied in D. melanogaster and M. domestica. However, studies of Drosophila Ace orthologous genes failed to identify mutations responsible for organophosphate resistance in other species. Subsequently, mutations in the Drosophila Ace paralogous genes were found to be associated with the resistance in some mosquitoes. The increasing number of insect genome sequences reveal that the ancestral condition, at least in Pterygota, is two copies of Ace. It also appears that mutations on the Drosophila and Musca Ace paralogous genes are more important than the mutations on the Drosophila orthologous genes, in terms of conferring organophosphate resistance, at least in many species.",
