            "text": "Persistent policy failures have been examined in recent years with a focus on the role of political systems. We evaluate the growth of dysfunctional policymaking in the U.S. and propose a countering approach. Policy failures often reflect partisan policy stalemate, errors or unintended consequences, polarized extremism or imbalance, or partisan reversals with changes in power. Extremes in partisanship are not new historically, but growing policy failures due to negative partisanship have now severely damaged public trust. More \"party blind\" conditions in policy formulation may be able to renew a more productive social contract. We propose a disruptive presidential leadership approach of bipartisan inclusion to seek to reframe the partisan divides, counter negative partisanship and extremes, re-establish better policymaking interactions, and improve governance and policy outcomes. Dysfunctional policymaking has been attributed to Republicans and Democrats in a Prisoner's Dilemma. Iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas often lead to higher rates of cooperation, and similarly, historical policymaking included greater cooperation, but in recent decades the bipartisan norms of governance have substantially eroded. We describe three complementary explanations, which suggest that non-cooperative partisan policymaking has become self-reinforcing, and institutional changes to promote cooperation should focus on lowering the risk-adjusted cost-benefit ratio, making cooperation safer and more attractive for policymakers.",

This paper evaluates the growth of dysfunctional policymaking in the U.S. compared with earlier history and proposes a countering approach. Policy failures often reflect partisan policy stalemate with a drifting status quo, errors or unintended consequences, polarized extremism or imbalance, or partisan reversals with changes in power. Extremes in partisanship are not new historically, but growing policy failures due to negative partisanship have now severely damaged public trust in institutions. We describe three complementary explanations, which suggest that non-cooperative partisan policymaking has become self-reinforcing, and institutional changes to promote cooperation should focus on lowering the risk-adjusted cost-benefit ratio, making cooperation safer and more attractive for policymakers. We propose a disruptive new form of presidential leadership joined with other approaches to improvement. Government policymaking dysfunction from partisan polarization is generally seen as a corrosive failure of institutions (Thurber and Yoshinaka 2015) . Much of it being reflected in a lost sense of governing trust (or social contract) and many deadlocked unmet policy needs. Over 80% of Americans have said the country is greatly divided about important values, with 77% saying they are dissatisfied with the state of politics (Summers 2018) . About 70% to 90% have said they are very concerned with the deepened polarization, bitterness, disrespect, contempt, and even hatred between groups (Brooks 2018a . A December 2018 New Hampshire poll found more voters viewing political dysfunction (74%) and disunity (68%) as a threat to America than any other major issue (Troiano 2019) . After the 2018 midterm elections, The Economist (2018) emphasized America's divisions and prospects for poor policymaking with both sides declaring victory. Most of the public expected gridlock through 2020 (Pew Research 2018) , and, as in previous years, this has been a good general forecast.",

            "text": "With many unaddressed policy tradeoffs and needs, political candidates can seek or rise to power through major policy failures, failures that are inflated, embellished, and aggrandized, or alignment with specific voter protest or identity groups. Unmet needs in turn encourage more power-play policymaking or obstruction (e.g., laws passed or blocked along party-line votes) and more ominously, authoritarian tendencies. To counter these trends, we suggest that a new form of social contract between the dominant governing parties may be possible through a reframing of policymaking interactions to encourage better governing norms. A recent RAND study (Kavanagh and Rich 2018) found that in earlier periods of turmoil, a revival of factual policy analysis and journalism and a focus on holding leaders accountable helped clarify the line between opinion and fact. A similar renewal today might re-orient policymaking to more fact-based rationality, assessment, and purpose (Perl et al. 2018 ). Our proposal requires leadership but no new laws. More \"party blind\" \"auditioning\" conditions in policy formulation may better balance and improve cooperative policymaking. We propose a new presidential administration with bipartisan leadership inclusion in policymaking.",

Prior to 2017, recent decades of legislative changes or corrections in policy have not appeared to systematically advantage either conservatives or liberals (Curry and Lee 2019; Lee 2015) . With a few landmark exceptions generally realized through unilateral power, the limited laws that have passed have not included many potential larger or more difficult changes. More difficult policy improvements requiring broader bipartisan support persistently fail to succeed legislatively or even reach the floor of the Senate or House for votes. 1 In 2017-2018, a stronger partisan tilt through unilateral power became prominent (with the GOP President, Senate, and House before 2019). New administration policies (several more extreme), judicial appointments, and legislation or legislative attempts, with Congressional support or acquiescence, rescinded or reversed the directions of many previous Obama administration policies and longstanding bipartisan approaches. 2 The shift of the Supreme Court and judiciary to the right has grown as Trump and the GOP-controlled Senate have enacted the long-term strategy of the Federalist Society and beyond with several doctrinaire judges appointed despite ratings of 'unqualified' by the American Bar Association. (In comparison, none of Obama's judicial nominees were rated unqualified.) Senate denials blocked many of Obama's nominees, culminating in the unprecedented 9-month refusal to give Obama's last high-court nominee a hearing. Since the power shift in Congress after the 2018 midterms, GOP Senate leader McConnell has returned to his previous obstructive tactics, blocking from consideration nearly 400 bills passed in the Democraticcontrolled House (Axelrod 2019; Martin 2019) .",

He has made the problems of political polarization-punctuated by the 2019 House impeachment of Trump followed by Senate \"forgiveness\"-and resulting policymaking stalemates much worse.

Various observers, however, have argued against such proposals-or any form of unity in 2020 (Shepard 2017; Smith 2018) . Many Democrats now see the GOP's leadership as incapable of meaningful compromise or \"unity\" (Tomasky 2019b), which calls for staunch political opposition and partisan elections, not \"dreamy\" calls for unity. For a candidate from either party, a unity ticket risks splitting party-line votes and handing easier victory to the opposingparty candidate (a large percentage of Independent voters \"lean\" toward either Republican or Democrat based on Gallup and Pew Research polling).

This plan will seek a new form of governing social contract through presidential leadership, which requires no new laws. Past administrations have retained in their leadership only a small number of opposing-party functionaries at times (typically holdovers). 3 By including policy-experienced non-extremist leaders from both the winning and opposition parties on the same operational administration \"team\" with mutual interests in superordinate goals, this proximity in executive-branch policy formulation may lower the risk-adjusted costs and raise the mutual-party-leader payoffs of policymaking cooperation. Resulting policy changes reflecting bipartisanship from the executive federalism of this new administrative state, and bipartisan-supported proposals from this new type of administration, could both enact more balanced and durable executive-branch policies and help change the public discourse to achieve more balanced and durable policymaking legislation. Through this disruptive reframing, key national leaders could thus potentially be nudged (Hallsworth and Egan 2018) away from policy gridlock, toward greater trust, and into more productive and fact-based, effective and balanced policies and governance.",

Institutional remedies show promise despite being generally slow-moving changes or legislation (e.g., Mann and Ornstein 2012; Weiser and Bannon 2018; Wheelan 2019 ). An important set of approaches seeks to address factors in the social psychology that sustain the sharp divisions and unwillingness or inability to effectively cooperate toward the advancement of larger common goals. These approaches focus on grass roots change in individual social responsibility, social activism, political activism, and social interactions to promote greater tolerance, fact-based assessments, and bipartisan dialogue (Brooks 2019; Hartle 2019; Freedman 2019; Haynes 2018). many governance outcomes-especially in larger or more significant and durable ways. A general explanation of cooperative failure, as suggested by Stewart (2015) , is that cooperation fails when the ratio of costs to benefits becomes too high.",

If Republicans in power can push through their desired policies without any Democratic ideas or votes, they generally don't need them, and they tend to view this as the best policy outcome for the country.

The growth over time of multiple policymaking powers concentrated in the \"imperial presidency\" and \"executive federalism\" has significantly enhanced the one-party-dominant policymaking potential gained through electoral victory of the Presidency (Schlesinger 1973; Modie and Curcy 2011; Friedersdorf 2016; Cost 2018; Head 2019a, b; Blow 2019; Thompson et al. 2018) . Particularly when a party holds the White House and both houses of Congress with sufficient party loyalty in votes, the losing party's acquiescent \"cooperation\" on opposed policy matters is guaranteed as the losing party can only \"resist with insufficient power,\" e.g. in the recent-years' focus on political appointments to the judiciary. 8 The incidence of cooperation depends significantly on the game's parameters. More asymmetric payoffs lower the likelihood and frequency of cooperation making cooperation unstable and less sustained (Sheposh and Gallo 1973; Beckencamp et al. 2007; Ahn et al 2007) . 9 As the payoff structure has become more asymmetric, more combative non-cooperative strategies have emerged with political successes, further lowering cooperation. Non-stop strategizing for electoral gains polarizes not just elections but the many processes of governance and policymaking, with countervailing unilateral obstructions, tit-for-tat non-cooperation, and power-play policymaking. Repeated non-cooperation tends to follow any defection nearing the end of a finite game. Trump's nonstop campaigning from the time of taking of office, for example, has heightened the reframing of governance as a nearing-end finite game. The general observation that \"little gets done in an election year\" now extends to almost every year.",

Non-cooperative GOP behavior persisted through Obama's two presidential terms (compromises came close to passage in Congress but could not move beyond obstructions from Republican factions), leading to tit-for-tat presidential and Democratic behavior. The general state of non-cooperative policy deadlocks and power plays has only grown through the Trump years. GOP-leader \"successes\" in obstructions and power-play policy changes have evolved the current GOP-leadership strategy into refusing to allow Democratic party leaders to effectively govern after they are elected, while waiting to aggressively pursue a power shift back to the GOP for pursing GOP-preferred policies. Such \"achievements\" reinforce the asymmetry of the perceived payoff structure, with stronger incentives to obtain the dominant power-play policymaking position. 12 Many Republicans, in addition to most Democrats, have found the candidacy and presidency of Donald Trump \"distasteful\" at least, repulsive, or unacceptable (at least privately) in its incivility, divorce from facts, policymaking incompetence, and authoritarian extremism. In many ways, however, Trump's tactics have been a grotesquely logical extension of 11 The minority or non-dominant party can still have influence, where allowed, for example through legislative amendments (Krehbiel et al. 2015) . 12 The origins of the party-based asymmetry in policymaking behavior may reflect, for example: (1) GOP antipathy to \"big government\" (except for military spending) with a ruthless calculus that government dysfunction benefits Republican as opposed to Democratic policy preferences (Lofgren 2011);  (2) policy problems creating more demands for government action, which Republicans generally prefer to oppose; (3) differences in personality-type and civics across the parties (including the styles of party leaders), e.g. more judging assertive or persistent types among Republicans or conservatives and more agreeableness among those with left-wing orientation (Drenth 2008; Darrell 2016; Furnham and Fenton-O'Creevy 2018) ; Allgood et al (2010) found economics majors more likely to be Republicans, while in Prisoner's-Dilemma experiments Frank, et al (1993) found that studying economics as an undergrad may inhibit cooperation; (4) GOP party leaders anxious to \"leave their mark\" on history; and (5) long-term urbanization, industrial shifts, and changing demographics and societal practices that have typically aligned more with the Democratic party, threatening traditional Republican societal preferences and comfort with the past. combative noncooperative strategies. The continued support of the GOP party structure in addition to Trumpian loyalists reveals both the strength of Republican leaders' \"win at all costs\" policymaking resolve and the depths of \"us-versus-them\" party ideology.",

The need to belong, affiliate, reinforce, and elevate one's group is a strong psychological motivation (Baumeister and Leary 1995) . Social identities and the biology of groups (Hornung et al. 2018; Forsyth 2019) incline policymakers toward conformity with party policy views, party loyalty, party-affiliated campaign themes and public expressions, and party-line voting (Bernheim 1994; Cialdini and Goldstein 2004; Berns et al 2005; Yu and Sun 2013; Close 2016; Harell 2018; Cherry 2019) .

Polarized identities with intolerance of \"others,\" mistrust, and lowered willingness to negotiate and compromise over opposing policy viewpoints have grown, as have more extreme and caustically expressed political views, elevated by accommodative media coverage of policymaking fights or \"battles.\" Trends of politicized evidence and willful ignorance (Perl et al. 2018; Paul and Haddad 2019) have helped to fuel negative partisan views of the \"other side\" with their \"bad people\" and \"dangerous ideas\" (Theodoridis 2016; Hetherington and Rudolph 2015) , strangely inventive conspiracy theories, and partisan denials and disagreements on simple facts (Dunning 2016) . Low turnout in party primaries and ideologically driven voters have advantaged more extremist candidates with a limited but more mobilized base of support, resulting in a hollowing out of lawmakers with more centrist views in Congress (Wheelan 2013; Gehl and Porter 2017; Mann and Ornstein 2012) .

Many voters may care more about their social identities than the particulars of any ideology, affecting coalitional views within both parties (Bacon Jr. 2019) . A more uncertain environment may also tend to incline individuals toward preferring a dominant leader, even a polarizing one (Kakkar and Sivanathan 2017) . Kavanagh and Rich (2018) concluded that, compared with earlier historical periods of \"truth decay\" (the 1880s-1990s, 1920s-1930s, and 1960s-1970s) , the last two decades have seen a similar blurring between opinion and fact, and similar growth and influence of opinion, but a deeper loss of confidence in major institutions, and more disagreement about facts and interpretations. With Orwellian lies and counterattacks now regularly assaulting facts, truth, and the mainstream media from the highest office today ( 15 In the excesses of the Trump era, the marks of authoritarianism with power-play policymaking have become clear. 16 Enough votes against mainstream candidates empowered through the primaries and electoral college a new type of president even though he was viewed by many as a \"deeply flawed and clearly unfit demagogue\" (Dionne et al. 2017 ). 17 Unlike past presidents, apart from occasional speeches scripted by others, Trump has made no attempt and shown no capacity for uniting the country or actually \"making policy deals,\" but instead has become a Twitter-message divider in chief. Nonetheless, he has retained strong percentage support within the Republican base-although this firm base is not a particularly large share of all Americans. 18 Past American demagogues such as 15 Stretched political and policy-outcome narratives have long played out in political \"spin,\" especially during election years. In recent years, however, negative partisanship has dominated partisan media and policymaking practice, leading to Trump's unprecedented falsehoods and obfuscation of facts. 16 Authoritarian tendencies are not just a U.S. phenomenon, as recent events in Britain have shown, for example, with Boris Johnson's move seeking to suspend Parliament at the critical September-October 2019 Brexit juncture. 17 Protest voting against mainstream politicians has continued to emerge in many other countries as well. 18 Self-reported Republicans and Democrats have become minority groups in Gallup polling, hovering generally around 25-27% for Republicans, and 27-32% for Democrats. Problems from the Iraq war, the financial crisis, other policy-related problems, and policy gridlock have been significant factors taking down the percentages of self-reported Republicans since 2005, and the percentages identifying as affiliated with either party. Since 2005 and especially since 2010, self-reported Independents have clearly become the largest, hovering in recent years generally between 37 and 45%, reflecting dissatisfaction with the two parties or party leaders. With Independents asked how they \"lean,\" toward Democrat or Republican, added in, a tendency toward party conformity is much higher, in recent years around 45-50% toward the Democratic party and about 40-45% toward Republican. These totals may be inflated by the nature of the Gallup question (only two choices), however, and even the sum of these two totals has declined over time from about 90-95% to 85-90%. 14 A striking example occurred in the opposed public views of Republican and Democratic leaders concerning Trump's multiple actions in the Ukranian arms-for-investigations-of-opponents shakedown culminating in his remaining in office despite impeachment.",

GOP tolerance of Trump has reflected \"ideological collusion\" (Ermakoff 2008 ) through sufficient overlap with the mainstream GOP's agenda. 19 Policy deadlock through stalemates and alternating parties in power has become widely recognized, but \"winner take all\" strategies for party dominance coupled with \"illusory superiority bias\" (Ghose 2013) may cause \"predictably irrational\" expectational and confirmation biases (Ariely 2008; Jerit and Barabas 2012; Wason 1960) with leaders from both parties believing that they can, should and will win more policy changes through successive elections than they actually do win over time. A condition of a Prisoner's Dilemma may be violated-that the players should not find it better to \"take turns\" exploiting each other. The payoff for mutual cooperation should be greater than the approximate average of the payoff for the temptation and sucker (Chong et al. 2007, chp. 1) . This condition is not satisfied if party leaders generally believe that, in a more-or-less alternating sequence, they can achieve more in power, and later lose less out of power. Other cognitive biases conditioned by party loyalty may create 'noise' that interrupts behavioral signals of reciprocating cooperation and further lowers perceptions of potential routes to balance and compromise (Jerit and Barabas 2012; Wason 1960; Molander 1985) .",

Training and traditions in the law and legal representations have taught many policymakers to think in terms of zealous advocacy for the \"client\" (in this case, the party's policy position) and a zero-sum win-or-lose game. Another reason for such concentrated polarization may reflect the basic neuropsychological need for party leaders to respond most, and answer to their more extreme party wings and dogmatic adherents (Zmigrod 2019) when most mobilized, by cases of identified versus statistical lives (Cohen et al. 2015 )-a key reason why political campaigns highlight identified-life cases rather than dry statistical policy tradeoffs. With concentrated leadership polarization, so long as partisan warfare continues, policymaking leaders may feel largely compelled to endlessly seek \"zero-sum\" dominance or the upper hand rather than striving for more productive bipartisan balance and compromise-even as the public continues to lose trust in this policymaking process. 19 Feldman and Stenner (1997) and Stenner (2005) , for example, describe the associated personality traits of a predisposition toward authoritarianism. Rauch (2016) similarly describes 'politiphobes' who believe that meaningful policy disagreements don't even exist and obvious policy solutions (the sorts they prefer) are not enacted because politicians are corrupt, self-interested, or addicted to unnecessary partisan feuding. Weiler (2009), MacWilliams (2016) , Taub (2016) and Jacobs (2018) , for example, have described the associated factors as the rise of American authoritarianism, rooted in psychological tendencies desiring order and fearing outsiders or normative threat. Pettigrew (2017) describes the corresponding and related social psychological perspectives on Trump supporters, and Ongstad (2019) describes Trump's brand of uniquely \"American authoritarian\" actions. Trump's brazenly asking for supportive election meddling by foreign governments and apparently \"getting away with it\" further encourages the GOP's \"win at any cost\" partisan beliefs and behavior and incents Democratic leaders and strategists to respond with noncooperation.",

The best responses for each party leader are clearly to cooperate in response to cooperation, and cheat or defect in response to cheating. After recurring rounds of cheating (and alleged cheating) to try to exploit the other party (with the 0,2 or 2,0 payoff temporarily), however, each side finds that the non-cooperative equilibrium generally prevails with the illustrative (1,1) average payoffs for each party in the non-cooperative equilibrium.

Republican and Democratic policymakers find this unobtainable, however, because they are risk averse and have become increasingly uncertain about the prospects for larger, meaningful, but very difficult progress on cooperation and compromise between their divergent policy views. Even where risk aversion is lower, due to ambiguity effects policymakers avoid more prolonged negotiating choices with ambiguous or unknown outcomes (Frisch and Baron 1988) . Untrustworthy and mercurial negotiating tactics, such as exhibited repeatedly by Trump in Congressional dealings, further forestall any cooperative policymaking progress. Cooperative outcomes are \"payoff dominant,\" but non-cooperative outcomes are \"risk dominant\" (Harsanyi and Selten 1988) . Non-cooperation dominates by being the safer option (Golman and Page 2010) . Without a reasonably successful social contract to encourage or enforce greater cooperation (Skyrms 2001 (Skyrms , 2004 , cooperative policy outcomes are persistently thwarted, especially on larger or more difficult issues. 20 The traditional social contract, following partisan elections, encouraged more cooperation through bipartisan problem-solving and negotiation traditions and procedures in governance (Foran 2018; Rauch 2016; Moss 2012 ; Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018)-as resulted, for example, in the Reagan-O'Neill Social Security Deal of 1983 (Dallek 2009 ). Although the Stag Hunt view allows for a stable equilibrium of policymaking cooperation, it does not solve the problem of cooperation since there is also the non-cooperative equilibrium (Skyrms 2004) . A cooperative equilibrium requires that enough policymakers from both parties somehow agree to negotiate in good faith, agree to compromise, and agree to \"hunt\" the larger more lasting bipartisan policy improvements through consistent mutually practiced cooperation. 21 20 Learning is a complex topic in game theory social dilemmas, and fear of a greater loss in the \"sucker\" payoff may have risk aversion effects primarily through fear of large losses (Macy and Flache 2002; Izquierdo et al 2008) . The avoided risks of cooperation may be less in the costs of thwarted policy gains and more in fear of larger \"sucker\" payoffs from compromise allowing policy changes that cannot later be undone, or from future electoral loss. This is a rational response to actual, perceived, or claimed partisan or extremist exercises of power. \"Win at all costs\" non-cooperative partisanship as a strategy makes opposing party leaders ever more risk averse against loss, ever more inclined to avoid compromise. Re-establishing trust between party leaders becomes increasingly difficult. 21 IPD research by Press and Dyson (2012a, b) , as described in Edge.org (2012), implies that opposing players can maximize their mutual scores through a cooperative \"treaty.\" Cooperate versus defect in political dysfunction can be viewed as \"peace or war.\" Agreeing to compromise also requires a sense of humility on policy views and willingness to work very hard to reach acceptable tradeoffs, despite many unpredictable challenges.",
