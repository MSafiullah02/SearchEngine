For that purpose L-phenylalanine (34.1.74) was sequentially trialkylated with benzyl chloride using a K2CO3/water system at reflux to produce a tribenzylated product (34.1.75). A solution with generated acetonitrile anion in THF was added to the benzylated product (34.1.75) at less than \u221240\u00b0C to yield the cyanomethylketone (34.1.76), which was exposed to Grignard reagent\u2013benzyl magnesium chloride to produce an enaminone (34.1.77). No racemization was observed in these two steps. The addition of the obtained enaminone (34.1.77) in THF/PrOH to a solution of NaBH4 and MsOH in THF at 5\u00b0C produced an intermediate aminoketone (34.1.78). No further reduction of the keto group occurs under these conditions. Reduction of the keto group could proceed by addition of a preformed solution of sodium tris(trifluoroacetoxy)borohydride in tetrahydrofuran [NaBH3(OTFA)], which produces a mixture of amino alcohols composed of 93% of the desired (2S)-5-amino-2-(dibenzylamino)-1,6-diphenylhexan-3-ol (34.1.79) along with 7% of the three undesired diastereomers. The crude mixture was debenzylated (Pd-C, HCONH4), and the product was purified by precipitation from iPrOH/HCl (aq) to produce (34.1.55) in greater than 99% purity and in high yield (Scheme 34.8\n.).",

The mixture was reformylated with acetic-formic anhydride to produce crude (34.1.116). Reductive cleavage of the furazan ring in the obtained product with zinc dust in acetic acid followed by heating facilitated cyclization to produce 2-(methy1thio)adenine (34.1.117), the protective benzoyl group of which was cleaved with aqueous methylamine by heating on a steam bath to produce (34.1.118). The 2-methylthio group of (34.1.118) failed to react in liquid ammonia at 90\u00b0C. For this reason, the 6-amino group of the mentioned compound (34.1.118) was transformed to a hydroxyl group with sodium nitrite in acetic acid, which yielded (34.1.119). Subsequent amination with ammonia saturated ethanol at 140\u00b0C in an autoclave produced the desired acyclovir (34.1.93) (Scheme 34.14\n.).",

The product from the previous step, and a large excess of potassium acetate in DMF, were heated to reflux for 5 hours to produce 2-(2-amino-1,6-dihydro-6-oxo-purin-9-yl)methoxy-1-acetoxy-3-benzyloxy-propane (34.1.132). Stirring of the last in 30% ammonia/methanol at ambient temperature produced the deprotected compound (34.1.133). N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-L-valine (34.1.120)/dicyclohexylcarbodiimide complex prepared in dichloromethane was added to the suspension of (34.1.133) in DMF followed by 4-dimethylaminopyridine. The workup of the mixture after 18 hours produced valinate (34.1.134). The obtained product was deprotected by hydrogenation over palladium hydroxide in refluxing ethanol to produce the desired valganciclovir (34.1.98) 173., 174. (Scheme 34.17\n.).",

For the preparation of amidoxime (34.1.184), hydroxylamine hydrochloride was added to a solution of (34.1.183) and potassium hydroxide in methanol. The amidoxime (34.1.184) was treated with dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (34.1.185) in chloroform to produce (34.1.186), which was taken into xylene and heated at 145\u00b0C for 48 hours to be cyclized to pyrimidine-4-carboxylate (34.1.187). The obtained compound was benzoylated with benzoic acid chloride in pyridine to produce (34.1.188), which was purified by flash column chromatography and then N-methylated with dimethyl sulfate in dioxane using lithium hydride as a base, which provided the compound (34.1.189). The prepared (34.1.189) was hydrogenated in the presence of 10% Pd/C to produce the N-deprotected product (34.1.190), which was acylated with freshly prepared 5-methyl-1,3,4- oxadiazole-2-carbonyl chloride (34.1.191) in the presence of triethylamine in dichloromethane. Finally, refluxing prepared (34.1.192) overnight with p-fluorobenzylamine in methanol produced the desired raltegravir (34.1.178) 265., 267., 290. (Scheme 34.23\n.).
