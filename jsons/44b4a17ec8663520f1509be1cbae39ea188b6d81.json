Roussel An understanding of the relationship between gastrointestinal (GI) motility and disease is imperative for the proper treatment of large animal patients, especially as new therapeutic agents become available. However, the abundance of information that has become available in the last 2 decades makes gaining this understanding a formidable task. This article summarizes the changes in he effects of disease on gastrointestinal (GI) motility T have been investigated since the 19th century. However, there has been an explosion of information in the last 20 years, and it is no longer acceptable to describe changes in GI motility as simply increases or decreases in motility. GI motility can be evaluated by quantifying several different parameters. A better understanding of the relationship between GI motility and disease is imperative to proper patient care, especially as new therapeutic agents become available. This article focuses on the specific changes in GI motility caused by some common diseases and conditions encountered in large animal practice. Until more studies specifically involving large animals are available, we must extrapolate from other species. However, in doing this, we must remember the extreme variation in the structure and function of the GI tract among species, particularly in the large intestine, and make extrapolations with caution. Data from human patients, small animals, and laboratory animals are included in this review; however, only those diseases and conditions affecting large animals are discussed. Also, only results of in vivo studies are included. More extensive reviews, including data from research in vitro, are available for most of these subjects. A brief discussion of normal motility patterns is included to familiarize the reader with terminology. For a more detailed description of normal motility, terminology, and recording methods, the reader is referred e1~ewhere.I.~ Therapeutic options will not be discussed in this article, but several reviews on this subject are also a~a i l a b l e .~.~",

Myoelectric and mechanical activities are closely coupled: as one increases, so does the other.\"' However, transit of gut contents does not always increase as myoelectric and mechanical activities increase.* Two types of myoelectric activity, slow waves and spikes, are produced by the GI tract. Slow waves are subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential that are not accompanied by muscle contraction (Fig 1) : and are continually propagated from the esophagus to the rectum. Spikes are membrane fluctuations that exceed the threshold, causing depolarization and muscle contraction (Fig 2) .' They are usually superimposed on slow waves, and groups of spikes assume several different patterns depending on the species, the area of the GI tract, and the digestive state studied. The migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) is the myoelectric pattern in the stomach and small intestine of fasted nonruminants, fed and fasted ruminants, and pigs and horses fed ad libitum.23339-\" There are 3 phases of the MMC: the quiescent phase, in which very little spike activity occurs; the irregular phase, characterized by intermittent spike activity; and the activity front, characterized by intense, continuous spike activity (Fig 3) .'-3.9.10 There is very little muscle contraction or transit of gut contents during the quiescent phase.',8 During the irregular phase, contractions mix the gut contents and propel them in an aboral direction.'**.'' The activity front is accompanied by intense muscular contraction that obliterates the lumen, preventing backflow of contents as it propagates, or \"migrates\" down the gut.','\" In nonruminants, and pigs and horses fed periodically, feeding abolishes the MMC pattern for several hours. The MMC pattern is replaced by the fed pattern, which is characterized by intermittent spike activity resembling the irregular Normal cecal and colonic myoelectric activities, like those of the small intestine, are Characterized by slow waves and spikes. However, unlike the small intestine, the patterns of spikes vary greatly with the species and the area of the large intestine studied. The two major spike patterns are the short spike burst (SSB) and the long spike burst (LSB).',2.'2SSBs cause segmental contractions and do not propagate; LSBs propagate both orally and aborally.'.'.'' There are many interchangeable terms for all of the patterns described. The terminology used here is preferred and will be used in the rest of the article.",

In a retrospective study of postoperative complications of horses with colic, POI was the cause of death in 36 of 84 patients (42.9%). 25 In human patients, POI causes serious discomfort and prolongs hospitalization after surgery. 26 Normal gastric and small intestinal motilities were altered in the postoperative period in several ways.

Early studies of dogs and sheep suggested that propagation of MMCs was not interrupted by resection and anastomosis or Thiry-Vella loop preparation.4',4z The complexes were said to start in the bowel orad to the anastomosis, migrate in sequence to the Thiry-Vella loop, and then to the aboral segment. Even though only a percentage of the complexes (60% in dogs, 30% in sheep) behaved in this manner, the authors suggested that continuity of the bowel was not needed for propagation of the MMC. However, in a similar study of dogs, Bueno et a14' showed that approximately twothirds of the MMCs appear to migrate directly across one anastomotic site, and only about one-third across a second anastomotic site. They also noted that the appearance and properties of these complexes were changed. This led them to the theory that MMCs do not propagate through anastomosis sites, but instead, new complexes are formed beyond the anastomosis. Thus, continuity of the bowel (ie, continuity of the enteric nerves and/or the musculature) is essential for normal propagation of the MMC.43 This theory has since been supported by other ~t u d i e s .~~.~' The new MMCs arising aborad to an anastomosis occur with higher frequency, and the activity fronts of these complexes are increased in dura-Coordination of propagation starts to return as the ti on . 43.45.46 normal healing process begins.

Different conclusions were reached with these experiments. In the first, Huber et al\"\" concluded that rumen stasis occurred because of a failure of neuromuscular transmission. Daniel'\" concluded that the changes in motility were caused by the generalized effects of calcium on smooth muscle contractility. Both agreed that subclinical hypocalcemia may play a role in the pathogenesis of abomasal displacement because abomasal motility is decreased before clinical signs of postparturient paresis occur. Because Madison and Troutt\"' found that decreased abomasal motility occurred in an \"all or none\" response, and only at serum calcium concentrations corresponding to clinical stage 3 postparturient paresis, they disagreed and concluded that subclinical hypocalcemia is not a predisposing factor in abo-masal displacement. Differences in experimental design, species differences, low numbers of animals, and inferences drawn from data that are not statistically significant make it difficult to draw a conclusion regarding the importance of blood calcium concentrations in motility.",
