Most people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) retain the initial infection and develop latent TB. This state is characterized by evidence of an immune response against the bacterium but no signs of active infection. Latent TB can be maintained for the lifetime of the infected person. However, the MTB bacilli that persist in symptom-free individuals can reactivate and cause active disease in approximately 10% of those infected over a lifetime (Jasmer et al., 2002, Pai et al., 2004, Tufariello et al., 2003). An estimated one-third of the world's population is infected with MTB (Dye et al., 1999). This large reservoir of individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) poses a hurdle for TB elimination (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2000, Sterling et al., 2006, Sterling et al., 2011).",

            "text": "For nearly a century, the tuberculin skin test (TST) was the only available test for the detection of LTBI. However, the TST has its limitations, including low sensitivity in immunocompromised patients, cross-reactivity with the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine and environmental mycobacteria, and the need for a second visit, which often results in missed follow-ups (Menzies, 2000). A decade ago, interferon-\u03b3 release assays (IGRAs) were developed, in which interferon-\u03b3 titres are measured after the in-vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with antigens such as early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10). IGRAs have now become the gold standard for identifying individuals whose immune systems have previously encountered MTB (Lawn and Zumla, 2011). However, the sensitivity of these assays remains limited (70\u201385%) (Sester et al., 2011), and the higher material costs of IGRAs and their need for laboratory infrastructure, trained personnel, and venipuncture under field conditions pose serious practical limitations, particularly for high-burden, resource-limited countries. To date, no community-based surveys have been performed using IGRAs. In addition, the mechanisms involved in maintaining a latent infection are complex, and many fundamental questions regarding these mechanisms remain unanswered. Consequently, there is a need for better biomarkers for diagnosing LTBI and a greater understanding of the LTBI pathogenesis.",

            "text": "The discovery of biomarkers in body fluids has been advanced by the development of high-throughput spectrometric methods (Faulkner et al., 2012, Fertin et al., 2011). Particularly, magnetic beads combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) are a promising high-throughput approach to identify new potential biomarkers in various body fluids. Magnetic beads have large surface area and can capture more low-abundance peptides and proteins. The combination of magnetic beads and MALDI-TOF MS can leverage the advantages of both methods and, therefore, reduce the complexity and enrich low-abundance proteins (Huang et al., 2009). The technical performance of affinity bead purification is similar to that of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and it can be used to process many samples in parallel (Cheng et al., 2005). Many protein biomarkers of diseases have been identified using this technique (Dekker et al., 2010, Fiedler et al., 2009, Komori et al., 2012, Schwamborn et al., 2009). Previously, 1 study demonstrated that proteomic patterns based on such profiles can distinguish active TB from non-TB individuals (Deng et al., 2011). However, there remains a lack of published data using this method as a tool for biomarker discovery in LTBI.",

Moreover, chip-to-chip variation is another obstacle for the SELDI analysis. To overcome these problems, a magnetic bead-based plasma profiling method was developed in this study. This method leaves sufficient materials for subsequent protein identification experiments and can reduce assay-to-assay and researcher-to-researcher variations using functionalized magnetic beads and automated machines (Wong et al., 2010).",

These proteins may take part in inflammation control, which implicates active innate immune responses in an infection with MTB and suggests that the inflammatory response may play an important role during an LTBI. Among the APPs found in LTBI, fibrinogen is a necessary cofactor for toxic and proinflammatory activities. Fibrinogen includes fragments of the fibrinogen \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 chains, but in this study, we demonstrate that the fibrinogen \u03b1 chain precursor is the best discriminator and GA, SNN, and QC these 3 models all selected this protein. It is possible that fibrinogen \u03b1 chain is more associated with an inflammatory response to MTB than \u03b2 and \u03b3 chains of fibrinogen. Liu et al.

A study of an in vivo mice model of mycobacterial granuloma formation observed that fibrinogen promoted granulation tissue formation and suppressed leukocyte necrosis (Sakamoto et al., 2010). In the present study, we found that the fibrinogen \u03b1 chain precursor was significantly increased in the plasma of LTBI individuals.

ApoA-I has been demonstrated to be a negative marker in severe acute respiratory syndrome (Wan et al., 2006). It is unclear why this protein was down-regulated in LTBI. Mikkat et al. (2004) have shown that the concentrations of some negative APPs decrease in response to infection and inflammation because of increased transcapillary escape and catabolic rates.",

The APPs are generated as a systemic response not only to acute inflammatory stimuli but also to chronic inflammation.

UBA1, which was up-regulated in LTBI individuals, mediates the human HLA-F adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10) modification that is significantly involved in the immune response (Aichem et al., 2010). HLA-F adjacent transcript 10 expression is induced by interferon-\u03b3 and tissue necrosis factor \u03b1, which are crucial for protective immunity against mycobacteria (Tufariello et al., 2003). Another up-regulated enzyme, leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase (LTB4DH), is a member of the zinc-independent medium chain dehydrogenase reductase family. This enzyme might induce the enhanced degradation of prostaglandin E2 and promote CD8+ T cell proliferation and interferon-\u03b3 production from T cells. Thus, it is possible that UBA1 and LTB4DH participate in the immune response against MTB.",

In our study, 2 antioxidant enzymes, Prx-I and TKT, were identified in the plasma of individuals with LTBI. TKT serves as a reversible link between the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis, and it is a critical enzyme in the cellular defense against oxidative damage (Lassen et al., 2008). We observed up-regulated expression of TKT, implying its important role as an antioxidant. Prx-I belongs to a ubiquitous peroxiredoxin family, which has been shown to have multiple functions, such as enhancing natural killer cell activity, increasing cell resistance to oxidative stress, regulating transcription activator protein, and protecting erythrocytes against oxidative stress (Chen et al., 2004). Our current data showed that the Prx-I level in LTBI individuals was lower than in healthy controls, suggesting that the capacity of self protection is impaired in LTBI individuals in response to oxidative stress. The presence of antioxidant enzymes in the plasma of LTBI individuals indicated that the antioxidative response has an important effect on MTB-induced oxidative injury.",

In particular, these powerful models could accurately differentiate healthy, latently infected individuals from healthy MTB-noninfected controls. However, the present study is a preliminary research; further studies, increasing the sample size and including other inflammatory diseases into control group, are needed to confirm these results and especially to subsequently validate the discovered proteins. Additionally, 14 potential LTBI biomarkers were identified. Some of the identified proteins might participate in the regulation of inflammatory, antioxidative and host immune responses against MTB. It should be noted that measuring plasma protein levels is technically much easier than other approaches, such as IGRA, and offers an economical and effective initial detection tool in a clinical setting. It is our hope that further validation of these plasmatic profiles in LTBI will provide information on LTBI-associated targets and the process of pathogenesis.",
