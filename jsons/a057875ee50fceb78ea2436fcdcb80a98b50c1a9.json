In this chapter, recent progress in nucleic acid functionalization via a range of different cycloaddition (click) chemistries is presented. At first, cycloaddition/click chemistries already used for modifying nucleic acids are summarized, ranging from the wellestablished copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction to copper free methods, such as the strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition, tetrazole-based photoclick chemistry and the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction between strained alkenes and tetrazine derivatives. The subsequent sections contain selected applications of nucleic acid functionalization via click chemistry; in particular, site-specific enzymatic labeling in vitro, either via DNA and RNA recognizing enzymes or by introducing unnatural base pairs modified for click reactions. Further sections report recent progress in metabolic labeling and fluorescent detection of DNA and RNA synthesis in vivo, click nucleic acid ligation, click chemistry in nanostructure assembly and click-SELEX as a novel method for the selection of aptamers.",

The site-specific functionalization of nucleic acids proceeds primarily via solid phase DNA/RNA synthesis. Artificial nucleosides that possess reactive groups for click chemistry (at the nucleobase or at sugar moiety) are introduced as phosphoramidites, either internally or at the 5 0 -end of the synthesized oligonucleotide. Moreover, the use of solid supports bearing modified nucleobases allows the introduction of 3 0 modifications. These methods are widely employed for the site-specific attachment of labels such as fluorogenic tags, spin-labels or biotin to oligonucleotides, and are highly relevant for structural and functional studies of these nucleic acids [2, 3] . Requirements for solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis using modified nucleobases are, first of all, the compatibility of the introduced functional group with the reaction conditions of solid-phase synthesis. Moreover, limitations in length do exist for solid-phase DNA and RNA synthesis (shorter than 100 nucleotides for RNA synthesis); these restrict investigation of site-specifically modified long oligonucleotides such as long non-coding RNA molecules with a length of several hundred nucleotides.",

Furthermore, end-labeling of enzymatically prepared RNA molecules can be achieved using the corresponding for post-synthetic click chemistry modified starter nucleotides for T7 in vitro transcription. For a recent example, see J\u00e4schke et al. [11] . Here, RNA labeling was achieved using an alkynemodified dinucleotide as starter nucleotide for in vitro transcription. The 5 0 -end of the transcript remains unaltered, allowing ligation to other RNA molecules and resulting in an internally modified RNA oligonucleotide [11] .",

Selected examples are described in the following section. Alkyne moieties can easily be incorporated into DNA and RNA strands during solid phase synthesis and the site-specific incorporation of multiple, even consecutive labels into DNA has been demonstrated [12] . Using appropriate copper(I)-complexing ligands [22] to prevent copper-catalyzed cleavage of DNA [23] , azide-modified sugars and fluorophores react efficiently with alkyne-modified DNA [12] . The site-specific incorporation of different reporter groups, which is, for example, desired to study nucleic acid folding via F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) using an appropriate FRET pair as fluorophores, can also be achieved by postsynthetic click modification. For this, alkyne functionalized nucleobases possessing orthogonal protecting groups (TMS, TIPS) are introduced as phosphoramidites during solid phase DNA synthesis [13] . Selective stepwise deprotection of alkyne moieties allows labeling of DNA oligonucleotides with up to three different reporter groups [13] .",

To prevent RNA degradation, Cu II sulfate and sodium ascorbate for in situ generation of the catalyst and a Cu I stabilizing ligand are usually employed [22] . Azide functionalities were introduced into RNA strands via a two-step method by postsynthetically reacting amino-modified uridines with N-hydroxysuccinimide esters of an azide-modified carboxylic acid [26] .

[59] developed a carboxymethylmonobenzocyclooctyne-modified 2 0 -deoxyuridine phosphoramidite which possesses increased reactivity towards azide-modified reporter groups (k 2 = 0.8 M -1 s -1 in aqueous solution). Incorporation into DNA during solid phase DNA synthesis allowed postsynthetic SPAAC reaction with an quinolinium-styryl-coumarin azide dye probe.

Furthermore, the reaction of styrene-modified DNA with nitrile oxides was demonstrated, yielding only one regioisomer, 3,5-disubstituted isoxazoline [5] . Styrene functionalized nucleobases were either incorporated during solid phase DNA synthesis or as triphosphates in PCR reactions of fragments up to 900 base pairs.

Postsynthetic labeling is feasible using maleimide-modified fluorophores as dipolarophiles and irradiation at a wavelength of 365 nm [62] . The rate constant of the photo-click reaction is in the range of other fast copper-free bioorthogonal reactions such as Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions. An advantage of this photoclick reaction is the fact that the reaction only proceeds upon irradiation. This allows an exact timing of the reaction, which might be of interest for spatiotemporal control in live cell applications [62] .",

This catalystfree reaction can be extremely rapid in the case of trans-cyclooctenes as reactants with second order rate constants of up to 380,000 M -1 s -1 in aqueous solutions [64] , and reactions on genetically encoded alkenes in proteins and on alkene functionalized small molecules can be performed in living cells [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . The reaction is highly specific and cell toxicity of the tetrazine derivatives is negligible [66, 71, 72] . Moreover, tetrazine-fluorophore conjugates possess strong turn-on fluorescence after reaction with dienophiles that strongly depends on the fluorophore employed (fluorophore emission between 510 and 570 nm) [73] [74] [75] . This is an extremely important feature for labeling procedures in living cells and in vivo, where removal of unreacted probes is virtually impossible. To date, a few examples of iEDDA reactions on nucleic acids in vitro and in cells were reported. In 2010, J\u00e4schke et al. [76] reported the first example of DNA modification by the inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction between norbornene dienophiles and tetrazine-derivatives. 3 0 -and 5 0 -terminal labeling, as well as internal modification of DNA with norbornenes and subsequent iEDDA reaction, was demonstrated [76] . Yields of 96 % are observed using a 1:1 stoichiometry of DNA and tetrazine derivative [76] . Lower reactant concentrations and considerably lower excess of labeling reagent (usually 1:3 stoichiometry) compared to CuAAC, as well as the absence of any toxic catalysts, shows the potential of this cycloaddition reaction for in cell and in vivo applications.",

Three DNA methyltransferases belonging to the class of adenine-N 6 methyltransferases were identified from a screening of wild-type methyltransferases enzymes to successfully catalyze the alkyltransfer reaction: M.TaqI (target sequence 5 0 -TCGA-3 0 ), M.XbaI (5 0 -TCTAGA-3 0 ) and M.FokI (5 0 -GGATG-3 0 and 5 0 -CATCC-3 0 ) [83] .

[87] developed an in vitro approach for site-specific post-transcriptional RNA labeling using a deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme). Guanosine derivatives bearing bioorthogonal groups such as azide moieties were site-specifically transferred to the 2 0 -OH group of adenines in RNA oligonucleotides [88] . The DNAzyme recognizes the target nucleoside in the RNA substrate by hybridization. In the presence of Tb 3? as cofactor, a 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiester bond is formed between the 2 0 -hydroxyl group of the adenosine in the target RNA and the aphosphate of a 2 0 -azido-modified guanosine triphosphate derivative. Subsequent CuAAC click reaction allows the attachment of reporter groups such as fluorophores [88] . Long RNA oligonucleotides of up to 160 nucleotides are selectively labeled by this method [88] . This novel approach will certainly prove very useful for the selective labeling of long in vitro transcribed RNAs for biophysical studies.",

The first examples of an unnatural, biocompatible DNA backbone assembled by CuAAC click chemistry were demonstrated by Nakamura et al. [90] and Brown et al. [91] ; the latter named this method ''click nucleic acid ligation'' [53, 89, 92] . PCR amplification of a DNA oligonucleotide linked via 3 0 -azido-dT and 5 0 -propargylamido-dT by CuAAC was demonstrated by Brown's group in 2009; however, only the incorporation of a single thymidine residue was revealed by sequencing due to misreading of the triazole backbone by the DNA polymerase [91] . A more flexible second generation triazole linkage retaining the 3 0 -oxygen and more accurately mimicking the phosphate backbone could correctly be read by DNA polymerases. Both amplification in vitro by PCR as well as replication of a plasmid containing the triazole linkage in E. coli were demonstrated [93] . This approach was further extended to assemble long DNA oligonucleotides by multiple sequential ligation employing a masked azide approach and CuAAC and SPAAC reactions on solid phase [92] . The biocompatibility of the triazole linkage was further investigated in mammalian cells Top Curr Chem (Z) (2016) 374:4 using a click-linked gene encoding the fluorescent protein mCherry [94] . Error-free transcription of the click-linked gene was demonstrated [94] .",

These anchor groups need to be positioned at specific sites within the sequence, where they do not impede folding and function of the RNA molecule. However, this poses a problem for RNAs with sequences longer than 100 nucleotides, due to the limitations in solid phase RNA synthesis [3] . Complex ligation strategies are required to assembly RNA molecules with a length of 200-300 bases [96] , a common size for various naturally occurring non-coding RNAs [97, 98] , such as ribozymes or riboswitches. Ligation of highly structured RNAs often fails or results in low yields. An enzymatic approach for site-specific incorporation of modified triphosphates overcomes this obstacle: Unnatural base pairs can be employed for the site-specific introduction of various functional groups into DNA and RNA via standard enzymatic reactions such as PCR and in vitro transcription. Several research groups have been concentrating on the development of a third, unnatural base pair over the last decade which can be PCR amplified and transcribed into RNA in vitro by standard polymerases with almost similar efficiency and fidelity compared to the natural base pairs [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] .",

This versatile approach is particularly attractive for enzymatic synthesis of long DNA and RNA strands with site-specific modifications. Post-amplificational and transcriptional labeling via click reactions is more efficient, robust and particularly less pH-dependent compared to NHS-ester chemistry. Click functionalization of DNA strands containing unnatural base pairs was demonstrated by Romesberg et al. [120] . Amongst others, the d5SICS CO -dNaM unnatural base pair (Fig. 3a) was employed to introduce an alkene moiety into PCR amplified DNA oligonucleotides at one and two specific positions. An azide-modified biotin tag as well as two molecules of the N-terminal Src homology 3 domain from the human CrkII adaptor protein (nSH3) were attached via Cu 1 -mediated azide-alkyne click reaction after PCR amplification of the 133-nucleotide-long DNA fragment.",

The alkyne linker was attached to the Pa nucleobase for postsynthetic RNA labeling using coppercatalyzed azide-alkyne click chemistry (Fig. 3b, 1 ) [135] , resulting in a versatile labeling method for large RNA molecules. Post-transcriptional attachment of large reporter groups such as fluorophores avoids reduced transcription efficiency and selectivity caused by these bulky functional groups [146] . By this method, a 75-nucleotide tRNA molecule was site-specifically alkyne-functionalized at position 33 and subsequently reacted with fluorescent azides or azide-modified biotin [135] . Introduction of strained unsaturated ring systems such as norbornene to an UBP allows bio-orthogonal inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloadditions (iEDDA) [63, 66-69, 71-73, 75, 78, 80, 86, 147-150] on RNA with tetrazine derivatives using non-denaturing conditions during the postsynthetic labeling step while maintaining fast reaction kinetics [66, 67, 80, 144, 150] . We modified one component of an unnatural base pair system developed by Romesberg et al. to introduce one or two norbornene moieties at predefined positions into RNA oligonucleotides in an in vitro transcription reaction using the RNA triphosphate Nor-UB and the unnatural base dNaM as template (Fig. 3b, 2) . This allows functionalization of these RNA molecules directly after transcription with tetrazine derivatives containing for instance fluorophores or biotin. The native structure of the RNA will not be affected by the mild click reaction conditions, which can even be realized in a cellular context [66, 67, 80, 150] . This is of particular interest for labeling RNAs with Fig. 3 Unnatural base pairs for enzymatic site-specific labeling of oligonucleotides using click chemistry. a DNA labeling using the unnatural d5SICS-dNaM base pair [120] . PCR amplification was carried out with an alkyne-modified d5SICS nucleoside that can be reacted with azide containing compounds. b RNA labeling via T7 in vitro transcription. The functionalized unnatural triphosphate is site-specifically incorporated into an RNA transcript in an in vitro transcription reaction and posttranscriptionally labeled via click chemistry. Triphosphates of the depicted unnatural bases for coppercatalyzed (Eth-C 4 -Pa [135] ) and copper-free click reactions (N 3 -Pa [152] and Nor-UB [144] ) have been developed Top Curr Chem (Z) (2016) 374:4 complex folding pathways, such as riboswitches, ribozymes or aptamers, which cannot be correctly refolded in vitro after a denaturing purification step [151] .",

[153] The labeling process of genomes of replicating cells is schematically described in Fig. 4B . Components for the EdU labeling strategy have been commercially available since 2008 to study cell proliferation and differentiation. In contrast to Br-dU labeling, no prior nucleic acid denaturation by acid, heat or DNase digestion to allow anti-Br-dU antibody binding is required for detection. The harsh conditions required for anti-Br-dU antibody detection can, for example, destroy tissue structures. The small sized fluorescent azides can, in contrast to antibodies, diffuse through tissues and react with alkyne moieties in the genome without DNA denaturation. For EdU labeling, cells are incubated with EdU followed by fixation and detergent permeabilization prior to the addition of the staining mixture containing the fluorescent azide CuSO 4 and sodium ascorbate [153] . The method has also been used for labeling in whole animals; for example, for studying cell proliferation in the nervous system of embryonic [154] and adult [155] mice.",

            "text": "The introduction of functional groups on canonical nucleobases can be restrained, because these modified nucleobases need to be compatible with the enzymatic steps required in the SELEX process. A novel approach termed click-SELEX uses a modular strategy based on Cu 1 -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition to generate modified nucleic acid libraries (Fig. 5 ) [175] . 5 Schematic representation of the click-SELEX process: An EdU containing DNA library is functionalized via CuAAC using an azide-modified molecule. The library is incubated with the target molecule, unbound sequences are removed and the enriched library is amplified by PCR using EdU triphosphate instead of the canonical thymidine to reintroduce the alkyne moiety. Single-stranded DNA is prepared by k-exonuclease digestion. The modification can again be introduced by CuAAC for the next selection cycle. Adapted from [175] Alkyne-modified libraries containing 5-ethynyl-2 0 -deoxyuridine [12] (EdU, Fig. 4A ) instead of thymidine are prepared. Functionalization of the library is achieved by copper-catalyzed click reaction with azide containing compounds. As a proof of principle, 3-(2-azidoethyl)indole was used and successful selection was performed against cycle 3 GFP [175] . The amplification step after selection is carried out in the presence of EdU to restore an enriched alkyne-modified library for subsequent rounds of selection. At this point, correct amplification of the functionalized template strand by DNA polymerases is still a requirement for successful selection, and can restrict the size of the azide-modified compounds used.",
