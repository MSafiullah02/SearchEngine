However, simultaneously, the emergence of additional pathogens as potential blood contaminants gained attention. Some of these agents represented newly discovered entities (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS-CoA]). Others were known sources of transfusion complications that expanded into the United States (e.g., Chagas disease). Additionally, some agents demonstrated species jumping from animal hosts to humans (e.g., variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [VCJD], Asian influenza, and West Nile virus). Increasing globalization through commerce, travel, and social interaction requires that many infectious agents, once thought exotic or of remote significance, must be considered as potential blood-component contaminants.1,\n2 Alternatively, new information may reduce some concerns. For example, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), previously linked to humans undergoing xenotransplantation, currently appears less threatening.3\n",

Those answering affirmatively are deferred. However, donors are not asked about a recent history of tick bites or geographic residence because of the low predictive value associated with these questions. For example, 0.4% of donors in Connecticut reporting tick bites were seropositive for babesiosis antibodies compared with 0.3% in those not reporting tick bites.9 Serologic or PCR testing is impractical at this time. The absence of specific interventions to interdict donors capable of transmitting Babesia infections relegates clinical awareness and prompt antibiotic therapy as the primary modality for treating this infrequent complication of transfusion therapy.",

P. vivax and P. ovale, species that give rise to relapsing infections, rarely persist longer than 3 years.42 However, some infections do persist, and individuals with these prolonged infections will transmit malaria if their blood is transfused. Likewise, disease caused by P. falciparum, a nonrelapsing species, manifests within 1 year after departure from a malarious area 99% of the time, but a report of falciparum malaria occurring 13 years after departure from a malarious area has been published.41 The well-known ability of P. malariae to persist asymptomatically for decades in some individuals further highlights the difficulty of eradicating the risk of post-transfusion malaria through questioning of donors.42\n",

In at least six of the cases, platelets were the implicated blood component; however, in the seventh case, the implicated unit was not identified.63 Centrifugation may sediment T. cruzi into the platelet layer during component preparation, accounting for the association with platelet transfusions. Whereas room-temperature storage of platelets may favor parasite survival, T. cruzi has been shown to survive in refrigerated RBCs and whole blood for at least 18 to 21 days.51 In six of the North American transfusion-associated cases, a donor emigrating from a T. cruzi\u2013endemic region (Bolivia, Mexico, Paraguay, Chile) was identified. Four of the donors emigrated between 16 and 33 years before the implicated donation. Given this small number of cases, transfusion transmission of Chagas disease may be inefficient. In a study of 18 patients receiving blood from blood donors subsequently found to be T. cruzi seropositive, none of the recipients became seropositive after transfusion. However, only two received platelet transfusions.52 A report of Chagas disease also has been reported after transplantation involving an organ donor who emigrated from Central America appeared in 2002.60 The recipient of a kidney and pancreas died of acute Chagas myocarditis 5 months after transplant. The recipients of the other kidney and the liver were both also infected with T. cruzi.",

However, these changes were not made because of the belief that such testing might identify those at risk of transmitting the HIV. Subsequently, observational data did not support this assumption. Nonetheless, a National Institutes of Health Consensus Statement, issued in January 1995, recommended continuation of syphilis testing because its role in preventing transfusion-transmitted syphilis was not \u201cunderstood.\u201d70 A lack of complete laboratory data also supports test retention.

The infectious agent, Treponema pallidum, is an anaerobic organism that cannot be cultured in vitro.73 During treponema infection, nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies are produced. The nontreponemal antibodies (reagin antibodies) react against phospholipid isolated from beef heart or cardiolipin. These antibodies are detected by the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), and other tests in response to the interaction of infected host tissue with T. pallidum. They parallel the pathologic course but have no relation to immunity. Treponema-specific antibodies have a higher serologic sensitivity in the early stages of syphilis but are less effective indicators of disease activity. During the first 3 weeks after primary infection, the VDRL is positive in 30% of cases, and the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) test is positive in 50%. Other treponemal antibody tests, often used to confirm nontreponemal tests, include T. pallidum particle aggregation (TP-PA) and recombinant antigen tests. An automated test for treponemal antibodies, PK (TM) treponema pallidum (PK-TP), performed on the Olympus PK 7200, is widely used.74, 75, 76 Reaction patterns characterized by positive RPR or PK-TP tests and negative FTA-ABS reactions (so-called false-positive reactions) may be caused by hepatitis, mononucleosis, viral pneumonia, chickenpox, measles, immunizations, pregnancy, or laboratory error.

Not surprisingly, in plasma derivatives prepared from large-scale plasma pools, PCR testing detects parvovirus B19 in most lots. In observational studies, recipients of solvent/detergent\u2013treated plasma seroconverted after infusion of products with high-titer parvovirus DNA, 107.5 to 108.5 genome copies per milliliter, suggesting that the presence of anti-B19 antibodies was not protective against large viral loads. Seroconversion did not occur among recipients of lots with viral titers between 100.5 and 103.5 genome copies per milliliter.78 The virus is resistant to viral-inactivation steps such as solvent/detergent treatment and heat after lyophilization or in the vapor stage. Heat may reduce infectivity if applied in the liquid state. Children receiving plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates were at least 1.9- to 7.6-fold more likely to be B19 seropositive than were those receiving no product or recombinant-derived antihemophilic factor.87 Parvovirus seemingly becomes concentrated in the plasma fraction used in factor VIII preparations. Despite the high frequency of parvovirus exposure, long-term sequelae appear subtle.82,\n87 For example, parvovirus B19\u2013seropositive hemophilic children had an 8-degree loss in joint range of motion, a 0.48% difference, compared with seronegative children. Unlike factors VIII and IX, albumin has not transmitted parvovirus B19.82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 One report implicated parvovirus transmission by IVIG based on detection of viral DNA by PCR.89 However, no documentation showed the same viral genotype in the recipient and the immunoglobulin preparation.",

The normal host membrane prion protein PrP (designated PrPc), whose function is unknown, is protease sensitive, soluble, and has a high \u03b1-helix content. All prion diseases appear to involve conformational modification of PrPc to a protease-resistant altered isoform that forms amyloid fibrils (designated PrPsc). The conversion of PrPc to PrPsc results in refolding of a portion of the \u03b1-helical and coil structure of PrPc into \u03b2-sheets. Neuronal loss and vacuolization leads to a spongioform appearance in the brain cortex and deep nuclei.",

            "text": "CJD occurs at an incidence of 0.5 to 1.5 cases per 1 million population worldwide. This rate has increased slightly over the past decade presumably on the basis of improved diagnostic accuracy and greater numbers of older individuals.92,\n94 Fewer than 300 cases per year are reported in the United States. Sporadic CJD, causing approximately 85% of CJD cases, occurs in persons 40 to 80 years of age (average age at onset is 60 years) and is manifested by disordered sleep and decreased appetite, behavioral or cognitive changes or focal signs such as visual loss, cerebellar ataxia, asplasia, and motor deficits.91 The mean survival time is 5 months. The mode of infection for sporadic CJD is uncertain. Approximately 10% to 15% of CJD cases occur in patients with a family history of CJD, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and mutations in the PRMP gene that codes for the prion protein. More than 50 mutations in this gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 20, have been identified, but 4 point mutations at codons 102, 178, 200, and 210 occur in 95% of familial cases.91 Approximately 1% of CJD cases involve iatrogenic transmission. For example, CJD was transmitted by a corneal transplant from a patient with undiagnosed CJD, whereas stereotactic electroencephalographic silver electrodes previously implanted in a patient with CJD subsequently resulted in two iatrogenic CJD cases.91,\n92 More than 130 young adults have died 5 to 30 years after receiving intramuscular human growth hormone injections prepared from cadaveric pituitary glands from donors with unsuspected CJD.91,\n95 Cadaveric dura mater grafting with a commercial product prepared by batch processing resulted in at least 100 CJD cases worldwide, some occurring 18 years after graft placement.91,\n96 In sporadic and iatrogenic cases of CJD, a polymorphism involving codon 129 in the PrP gene appears to affect susceptibility. Normally 37% of the population are methionine/methionine homozygous, and 11% are valine/valine homozygous at codon 129. The remaining 52% are heterozygous. Homozygous individuals represent almost 90% of sporadic and iatrogenic CJD cases.96,\n100 Those homozygous for methionine are at risk for fatal familial insomnia, whereas those homozygous for valine are at risk of clinical CJD.91\n",

More than 180,000 cattle succumbed to BSE, but almost 1 million may have been infected. Because the mean incubation period for BSE is 5 years and most cows were slaughtered between 2 and 3 years of age, most cattle did not manifest disease.91, 92, 93 Approximately 50,000 BSE-infected cattle entered the food chain before the first BSE case was recognized in 1986. Subsequently, the onset of the BSE epidemic was traced to a meat-and-bone cattle feed made from sheep, cattle, and pig offal. The rendering process presumably resulted in the feeding of scrapie-infected material to cows. Use of sheep offal or other tissues from ruminant animals as feed for other ruminant animals was banned in 1989. The annual incidence of clinical cases in cattle peaked in 1992. After March 1996, only animals younger than 30 months were eligible for food preparation.93\n",

Eventually, 48 recipients of blood from 15 donors with vCJD were identified. Three of the 48 recipients, to date, have evidence of vCJD. One, at age 62 years, received non\u2013leukocyte-reduced RBCs from a 24-year-old donor who developed vCJD 3.5 years after the blood donation. The transfusion recipient developed vCJD 6.5 years after transfusion.112 The second patient received a transfusion of non\u2013leukocyte-reduced RBCs in 1999.113 The donor developed vCJD 18 months later. The asymptomatic recipient died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm 5 years after transfusion. At autopsy, protease-resistant prions were present in the spleen and cervical lymph nodes. Prions were not detected in the brain. The recipient, found to be heterozygous (methionine/valine at codon 129), did not have clinical vCJD, raising concern that the incubation period may be longer in codon 129 heterozygotes. In animal studies, a primary challenge with vCJD prions resulted in a significantly reduced transmission rate in mice with valine at codon 129 compared with that in animals homozygous for methionine.114 Additional data are needed to confirm whether the incubation period varies among methionine homozygous and heterozygous individuals. The third case developed vCJD approximately 8 years after receiving non-leukocyte-reduced red cells from a person who developed vCJD 20 months postdonation.114a\n",

Donors who spent 5 years or more in Europe before 1980 and the present are also deferred. In addition, donors are indefinitely deferred if they injected bovine insulin after 1980, received transfusions in the United Kingdom and France between 1980 and the present, or served in the military on bases in Europe for 6 months or more between 1980 and 1996. This geography-based donor-deferral protocol evolved in various phases beginning in 1999. Approximately 3.5% of potential donors in the United States have been deferred as a result of this policy.117 The impact was higher in Canada.118 In-date blood components and plasma intended for derivative production from these donors must be recalled, quarantined, and destroyed. Ongoing surveillance of vCJD cases, which increased after identification of a Texas cow with BSE, is currently being conducted, including a recommendation to notify the CDC about all patients younger than 55 years who are diagnosed with CJD.115\n",

For this reason, the U.S. FDA issued a guidance document in April 2003 requiring blood-collection agencies to defer anyone from donating blood for at least 14 days after possible exposure to SARS.148 Those with a suspected SARS illness were deferred for at least 28 days after recovery. Notices were posted in blood centers apprising donors about SARS-affected areas, and donors were asked about recent travel history. Those traveling to affected areas, including transit in an airport at these locations, were deferred from blood donation. The epidemic subsided within months.

In high WNV endemic areas, 1 in approximately 150 donors was WNV viremic.

Testing of individual samples in high-incidence areas increases test sensitivity by approximately 7% and was introduced in 2004 when incident cases exceeded preestablished thresholds (approximately 1 WNV-positive donor per 1000 donations). Only one confirmed transmission occurred in 2004. Among the 30 confirmed transfusion cases, all implicated donations were WNV IgM antibody negative.164,\n165\n",

(Of note, in Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale, a dormant stage [hypnozoites] can persist in the liver and cause relapses by invading the bloodstream weeks, or even years later.) After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony). Merozoites infect red blood cells. The ring-stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture, releasing merozoites. Some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes). Blood-stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. The gametocytes, male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes), are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal. The parasites' multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle. While in the mosquito's stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes, generating zygotes. The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) and invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts. The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites, which make their way to the mosquito's salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle.",
