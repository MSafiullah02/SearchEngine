Although women are underrepresented in leadership positions in healthcare, their significance in other leadership positions cannot be underestimated, as evident from the growing numbers of women CEOs, politicians, and heads of governments (Mayer & Oosthuizen, 2020) . Women leaders are strong advocates for immunization programs, education and equal employment opportunities (Beaman, Duflo, Pande, & Topalova, 2012) . Women senators lobbied for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act in the US (Lee et al., 2014) . Gender equity also has positive effects on firm performance and governance (Post & Byron, 2015) . This paper extends the growing research on the impact of gender equity by exploring its impact on public health outcomes using the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic as its research setting. The authors begin with an extensive review of the relevant literature to develop a conceptual model and specific hypotheses about the impact of gender equity and human development on women's representation in legislature and public health expenditure, and the combined impact of public health expenditure along with human environment (population density, aging population and urban population) on important public health outcomes in the Covid-19 context, including the total number of tests, diagnosed, active and critical cases, and deaths. The authors use the data from 210 countries to find support for many hypotheses.",

For example, women tend to be more cautious (Lundeberg, Fox, & Pun\u0107ocha\u0155, 1994) , risk-averse (Agnew, Anderson, Gerlach, & Szykman, 2008; Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer, 1999) , and fatalistic (Pandey & Jain, 2017 ) than men. Women put more emphasis on risk attributes (e.g., possibility of loss) in investment decisions than men (Olsen & Cox, 2001) and perceive more risk in traffic and environmental hazards (Dejoy, 1992; Fllyn, Sloic, & Mertz, 1994) . Besides being risk averse, women are also loss averse (Brooks & Zank, 2005) . In addition, there is a difference in risk-taking behavior between female and make leaders for the decisions making for themselves and their groups. Ertac and Gurdal (2012) show male leaders take more risk for the decisions made for their own and the groups than male non-leaders. On the contrary, female leaders take less risk on behalf of a group which is lower than that taken individually. These differences in overconfidence and risk aversion levels between females and males make females to be more cautious and take less risk in making decisions. Hence, the authors hypothesize as follows:",

Rapid urbanization in most countries in the last few decades has led to inadequate housing, congested public transport, poor hygiene, and high pollution level (air, water, and noise), which results in physical and mental health problems (WHO, 2020b) . In fact, infectious diseases and epidemics (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonia) are also more likely to happen in densely populated and urban areas (WHO, 2020a, b). As higher population density is expected to lead to more active transport, more perceived stress and smoking, it has negative effects on mortality (Beenackers, Groeniger, Kamphuis, & Van Lenthe, 2018) and health conditions (Greiner, Li, Kawachi, Hunt, & Ahluwalia, 2004) .",

All the VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) values are less than the recommended cut-off value of three, hence multicollinearity is not a concern (Hair et al., 2019). Next, R-square values are high for many outcome variables (e.g., number of tests = 0.13, diagnosed cases = 0.28, and deaths = 0.45), hence the model explains a significant proportion of variance in these variables. High values of the blindfolding-based cross-validated redundancy measure Q 2 also confirm the predictive accuracy of the PLS path model (Hair et al., 2019) . Finally, a low SRMR (0.054) and high NFI (0.86) also show a good model-fit in view of the many missing values in the dataset.

Both aging population and urban population have significant positive effects on the number of tests but only urban population has a positive effect on the number of deaths, which is not surprising as these two population segments have been the worst hit by the Covid-19 outbreak so far (Keil, Connolly, & Ali, 2020) .

However, despite these calls, women continue to be under-represented in top national and global healthcare organizations (WHO, 2017) and even government and legislatures(UNDP, 2020). This paper addresses these calls for greater representation of women in leadership roles by exploring the impact of gender equity on public health outcomes during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Using publicly available data for 210 countries, the authors analyze the impact of gender equity and human development on women's representation in legislature and public health expenditure, and the impact of public health expenditure and human environment (population density, aging population and urban population) on Covid-19 outcomes (number of tests, diagnosed, active and critical cases, and deaths).The results show a clear evidence of the importance of women's role in managing public health outcomes, with the strong positive effects of gender equity and the proportion of women in legislature on public health expenditure, which in turn shows significant impact on the number of diagnosed and critical cases but not on the number of deaths. However, the unexpected negative effect of human development on women in legislature and no significant effect on public health expenditure suggests a relook at the definition of human development.",

Hence, it would be expected that greater expenditure on public health infrastructure such as hospitals, ICU facilities and equipment such as ventilators, personal protection equipment (PPE) such as face masks and gowns, and healthcare professionals, would help deliver positive results in the battle against Covid-19. Hence, the authors hypothesize direct effects of public health expenditure on the various Covid-19 outcomes as follows:",
