In this report, we established two RNAi systems to be easily observed with strong and obvious effect. The function of the P19 of tomato bushy stunt virus, which suppresses RNAi in mammal cells, was then studied using these two systems. Short hairpin RNAs targeting green fluorescence protein (pshRNA-GFP) and firefly luciferase (pshRNA-luc) were designed and inserted into a eukaryotic transcriptional vector pTZU6+1, respectively. The shRNA expressing vectors were co-transfected with plasmids containing the target gene with or without P19. The GFP expression level was assayed by fluorescence microscopy, Western blotting and RT-PCR. The luciferase expression level was analyzed by the dual-luciferase assay system. pshRNA designed in this study down-regulated the target gene specifically and efficiently, with a decrease of expression of both genes of about 70%, respectively. When P19 was introduced into the RNAi systems, the expression of both GFP and the luciferase were mostly recovered compared with the control groups. The RNAi systems of GFP and luciferase were constructed successfully, demonstrating that P19 of tomato bushy stunt virus has the ability to counteract the RNAi effect induced by shRNA in mammal cells.",

Today, much improvement has been achieved in this field (16) . But the discovery of RNAi suppressors encoded by viruses will bring some new questions to the application of siRNA drugs. Benasser pointed out that HIV could resist the persistent vector-derived shRNAs since its Tas was a RNAi suppressor (1) . It may also be the case that some mammal viruses such as HCV, HBV and SARS-coV may also encode such RNAi suppressors and these factors could influence the therapy strategy of RNAi.",

Here, a vector expressing strategy and a vector with RNA promoter (U6) was chosen. The vector pTZU6+1 can drive the transcription of short hairpin RNA precisely, which would be transferred into a functional type of siRNA in mammal cells by the Dicer. When the HepG2-GFP was transfected with the plasmid pshRNA-GFP, the fluorescence was reduced significantly compared with the control group, which was transfected with the plasmid pshRNA-Luc (Fig. 2.A). This was consistent with the results from western blotting (Fig. 2.B). Analysis with the Genetools software indicated the amount of GFP decreased by 70%. To determine the influence on mRNA levels, we further detected mRNA by a semi-quantative RT-PCR test and found that pshRNA-GFP lead a decrease in mRNA level of EGFP (Fig. 2.C) by 78%. Therefore it could be concluded that the shRNA down-regulated the expression of EGFP and the down-regulation was a consequence of the degradation of mRNA. On the basis of the successful RNAi system described above, we studied the ability of P19 to suppress the RNAi effect in mammalian cells. When P19 and shRNAGFP were co-expressed in HepG2.GFP, we observed the phenol menon that the fluorescence recovered to a significant intensity compared with those cells without P19. The effect on efficiency on GFP expression was further evaluated by western blot for protein levels and by RT-PCR for mRNA levels.

When P19 was added into the RNAi system, luciferase activity recovered to a high level. reduced by 70%(Fig. 4) compared with the control group. It showed that the shRNA-Luc designed could down-regulate the expression of luciferase gene efficiently. When it was studied by the luciferase RNAi system, P19 was also found to be able to recover the luciferase activity significantly. Compared with the control group, when P19 was introduced into the cells, the relative luciferase activity increased to about 80%. The his tag did not impair the function of P19. Results from the luciferase RNAi system coincided with those from the GFP RNAi system.DISCUSSIONSRNAi is an ancient immune surveillance mechanism on gene level. It was shown to act as an efficient antiviral system in plant and insect cells and might also played an antiviral role in mammal cells(2,11).To counteract the antiviral effect of RNAi and enhance their existing ability, many plant and insect viruses express different RNAi suppressor proteins(14). These proteins always play important roles in the virus infection process and are important pathogens(12). The first identified RNAi suppressor, HC-pro of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV), was found when researchers studied the co-infection phenomenon in plants (8). Later, some other RNAi suppressors encoded by plant viruses were discovered and the mechanism of RNAi inhibition became better understood (15). Furthermore, several animal viruses such as flock house virus, influenza virus and reovirus were also found to encode proteins having the same effect as an RNAi suppressor (19,10). Recently, HIV-1 and PFV-1 (primate foamy virus type 1, a retrovirus similar to HIV) were found to be able to produce such RNAi suppressors too (1,3). Interestingly, HIV-1 can produce a siRNA in the infected cells to downregulate its Env expression while a cellular miRNA was verified to target the sequence of PFV-1 and could restrict the accumulation of PFV-1. These reports indicated that RNAi mechanism may also play an important role in vertebrate cells and the RNAi suppressor exists as an counteraction strategy to this antiviral mechanism. Similar to the phenomenon of RNAi, RNAi suppressor was firstly studied in the field of plant research. Nowadays, we have known that RNAi suppressors could take effect at different steps in the RNAi pathway (14). HC-pro, 3 factor of reovirus, and NS1 of the influenza virus countact RNAi by binding long dsRNA and reduce production of siRNA.Tat of HIV-1 can also limit the production of siRNA by influencing the activities of Dicer. Some suppressors such as P19 can bind the siRNAs and prohibit them into RISC (4). Other suppressors may also act at various steps. For example, some of them may influence the activities of members of RISC, and some of them may limit the transduction of systematic silencing signals in cells(18",

            "text": "also produced by Dicer and incorporated into RISC at last. miRNA and siRNA crossed partly in their pathway at least. If a protein could influence RNAi, it may also influence miRNAs. Since miRNAs have very important roles in keeping normal development and normal biological activity of cells, cells would be influenced when miRNA levels were changed. Patrice D et al studied the influence on miRNAs of several suppressors and discovered that most of them showed an obvious effect and could produce abnormalities (13). We could also predict the pathogenesis of the suppressor of animal viruses by influencing miRNA function. For example, a persistant production of the SRS in chronic virus infection may help to produce tumor and other chronic diseases. Tomato bushy stunt virus is a 4.7k nt plus RNA virus which infect agriculture plants and herbs. The P19 is essential for the viral pathogenity since it can enhance the ability of the virus to survive in infected plants by counteracting the RNAi system. It has been established that the RNAi mechanism is the most important defence strategy in plants. Daniel et al firstly reported that P19 could inhibit the RNAi effect in plants and pointed out it could combine the siRNAs and prohibit it incorporate into RISC. Recently, Ye et al elaborated the crystal structure of P19 and explained the physiochemical basis of its ability to combine siRNAs (5). In this report, RNAi systems targeting GFP and luciferase gene were constructed and used to identify the RNAi suppressor characteristics of P19. The results showed that P19 could also suppress RNAi effects induced by short hairpin RNAs in mammal cells as well as suppressing RNAi induced by synthetic siRNA or long dsRNA in plants. Our research confirmed that the suppressing ability of P19 was non-sequence specific for it suppressed both the RNAi targeting GFP and the RNAi targeting luciferase. Furthermore, our study showed that the RNAi system in mammal cells induced by vector derived shRNA is suitable for screening RNAi suppressors, and could be a more efficient approach compared with the methods such as transgenic plant models or virus infection models.",
