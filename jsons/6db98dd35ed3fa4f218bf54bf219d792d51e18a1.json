Data were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) of Thomson Reuters on March 27, 2017. A total of 564 publications on disaster medicine were identified. There was a mild increase in the number of articles on disaster medicine from 2008 (n = 55) to 2016 (n = 83). Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness published the most articles, the majority of articles were published in the United States, and the leading institute was Tohoku University. F. Della Corte, M. D. Christian, and P. L. Ingrassia were the top authors on the topic, and the field of public health generated the most publications. Terms analysis indicated that emergency medicine, public health, disaster preparedness, natural disasters, medicine, and management were the research hotspots, whereas Hurricane Katrina, mechanical ventilation, occupational medicine, intensive care, and European journals represented the frontiers of disaster medicine research. Overall, our analysis revealed that disaster medicine studies are closely related to other medical fields and provides researchers and policy-makers in this area with new insight into the hotspots and dynamic directions.

            "text": "N atural disasters, biological terrorism, nuclear leakage, public health emergencies, epidemic diseases, and other disasters directly threaten the survival and development of mankind. Currently, a major disaster occurs almost daily in some part of the world. 1 Most population centers are concentrated in high-risk locales like metropolitan cities, which feature very frequent and multiple person-to-person contacts. High-risk occupations, international trade, and housing construction all increase the possibility of human exposure to disasters, leading to increased casualties after each disaster. The ever-increasing spiral of human populations, the rapid growth of technology, swift world-wide travel by millions of persons, and the exponential expansion of at-risk industries and residences combine to increase human exposure to disasters. 2 In particular, the major casualties caused by the Wenchuan earthquake, the Nepal earthquake, and the Indian Ocean tsunami pose great challenges to disaster medicine. 3 The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake was one of the most devastating disasters in the past 10 years and caused more than 370,000 casualties; the main causes of death were trauma and crush syndrome. In addition, there was a significant increase in the number of respiratory infections, enteritis, and skin diseases in the week after the earthquake. Even a full year after the earthquake, some survivors began to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder. 4 Disaster medicine has attracted global attention gradually by implementing emergency medical treatment, disease prevention, and health care science under the conditions of disastrous damage. After the September 11 attacks, the United States made two major adjustments to the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) to form a high-efficiency operating mechanism called the national disaster medical rescue system. 5 Japan has also established a national rescue medical center in Tachikawa City, Tokyo. As a data transmission and command center for disaster medical care, it features a disaster medical information system used to determine damage for medical institutions. In addition, Japan has enhanced its disaster emergency medical rescues by launching civil and community organizations. 6 After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, China likewise began to attach importance to the establishment of an emergency medical system. Then, after experiencing the Wenchuan, Lushan, and Yushu earthquakes, and observing the actual rescue experience, it built an emergency medical rescue system, including a rescue command center and a medical rescue scene and rescue information platform. 7 Disaster medicine scholars have published a substantial amount of original research based on care during disaster rescues, emergency medical treatment, and disease prevention. However, the bibliometric profile of disaster medicine in the literature is still unknown. Therefore, in this study, a scientometric analysis was conducted on disaster medicine to estimate the productivity of specific journals, countries, institutions, authors, and research areas, and to identify research hotspots and trends in this field.",

The parameters in CiteSpace were as follows: time span = 10 years (2008-2017); time slicing = 1; term type = burst terms; selection criteria (c, cc, ccv) = (2, 2, 20) (4, 3, 20) (4, 3, 20) . The top 50 most cited or occurring items from each slice were selected. The Pathfinder network method was used to streamline the network and to map the visualization analysis. The network revealed 244 nodes and 517 lines. In Figure 2 , the thicker circle indicates a higher level of between-study centrality. In general, a study with a centrality value equal to or greater than 0.10 can be considered a key study; therefore, the key studies were [Subbarao I, 2008] 26 (0.22), followed by [Einav S, 2006] 27 (0.19) and [Gillett B, 2008] 28 (0.16). In addition, the red circles represent burst studies which represent the frontier of a period 29 ; Among them, the key burst studies were [Subbarao I, 2008] 26 and [Walsh L, 2012] , 30 which had the highest citation rates between 2014 and 2017. Figure 3 presents the timeline view for hot keywords. The results show that the hotspots of disaster medicine during this period were spinal cord injury, conceptual framework, health professional, occupational medicine, medical surge capacity, oleic acid, lifesaving intervention, terrorist bombing, developing country, workforce, professionalization and West Africa (Figure 3 ). In addition, the research papers published in journals represent the frontiers of certain subjects, and the references cited in these papers provide the knowledge base of the papers. 31 In Figure 3 , The nodes of clusters #3, #4, #5, #6, and #7 were mainly distributed before 2008 (the knowledge base), while the nodes of clusters #0, #1, #2, #8, #9, #10, and #11 were mainly distributed between 2008 and 2016 (the frontiers).",

In CiteSpace III, a current research front is identified based on such burst terms extracted from titles, abstracts, descriptors, and identifiers of bibliographic records. Burst-detection algorithms can identify emergent terms; Centrality: evaluating the parameter of the number of lines on a certain node, the larger the value, the more the number of lines, that is, the importance of the node in the whole network. Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness categories of disaster medicine, except for [Leaning J, 2007] , 17 which summarizes the challenges and pressures posed by natural disasters to public health. These categories are disaster rescue 16, [20] [21] [22] [23] and post-disaster health effects. [18] [19] [24] [25] Overall, the most cited article was \"Definitive care for the critically ill during a disaster: A framework for allocation of scarce resources in mass critical care -From a Task Force for Mass Critical Care summit meeting, January 26-27, 2007, Chicago, IL,\" which offers guidance for allocating scarce critical care resources, drawn from a task force on mass critical care. This task force provided several suggestions for managing the triage process when medical systems are overwhelmed. 16 In addition, [Devereaux AV, 2008] 16 was sponsored by New York University, which sponsored the greatest number of disaster medicine publications from 2008 to 2017. Among the authors, F. Della Corte, M. D. Christian, and P. L. Ingrassia were the most productive. In their papers, the most cited articles were all associated with the \"Task Force for Mass Critical Care.\" 16, [44] [45] Among the studies of post-disaster health effects, the most cited article was \"Trends in respiratory symptoms of firefighters exposed to the World Trade Center disaster: 2001-2005,\" which described trends in post-911 respiratory and gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms in WTC-exposed fire fighters. 46 This study also contributed to the literature on public environmental/occupational health, the discipline that produced the most disaster medicine studies from 2008 to 2017.",

Indeed, this study can help researchers better understand disaster medicine research worldwide and be useful, for example, in choosing appropriate journals for publication and collaborations. Fellows choosing an institution for advanced work may also be interested in such an analysis. Journals can determine where they stand in relation to other journals in publishing articles related to disaster medicine. Governments and policy-makers can also ascertain the most effective countries and institutions in the world in this field, and this analysis may assist them to apprehend and predict the hotspots and dynamic directions of disaster",
