            "text": "There is a lively ongoing debate on the role of EBV, the prevailing MS infectious risk factor and MS pathogenesis. [19] [20] [21] One hypothesis suggests that MS is caused by a genetically predisposed deficiency in eliminating previous EBV infection; EBV then persistently accumulates or even establishes itself in the brains of such patients. 7, 22 Consistent with this theory, EBV might exercise a strong influence on the number of na\u00efve and/or memory B cells and their differentiation status. 23 A competing hypothesis is that abnormal responses to EBV infection are secondary to and not a cause of MS. 24 At the epidemiological level, several systematic reviews clearly support an association between MS and EBV seropositivity. 3, 25, 26 Practically, all MS patients are EBV seropositive, raising the question of whether EBV-seronegative MS patients even exist. 27 EBV seropositivity confers double the risk of MS than infectious mononucleosis (IM) (OR=4.56 vs OR=2.17, respectively), 3 and IM appears to have a stronger genetic component than EBV infection. 28 However, the reasons for this difference in risk between EBV seropositivity and IM might be due to: (i) reporting bias for IM; (ii) the molecular stochasticity of EBV-induced downstream events; (iii) the role of EBV latency; or, importantly, (iv) subclinical infection. High Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG titres are associated with other MS risk factors such as non-HLA gene loci and the HLADRB1*15 allele (the most important genetic factor in MS). 7, 29 T cells restricted to the HLADRB1*15 allele and linked to MS-related antigens seem to cross-react with the immunological response induced by the EBNA-1 sequence. 30 However, the latest meta-analysis revealed an additive but not synergistic effect between the two risk factors, corroborating that HLADRB1*15 carriage is not a confounding factor for EBV and MS. 31, 32 A highly synergistic increase (14-fold) in MS risk was reported for EBV detection or IM combined with obesity, notably during adolescence. 7 However, there are conflicting results on the interaction between EBV and other well-established MS risk factors (reviewed also in 33 ). For instance, a prospective study found a positive association between smoking and MS development only in older patients and a negative one in patients less than around 30 years old, 34 whereas a later case-control study reported a negative, multiplicative interaction between IM history and a prior history of smoking on MS risk. 35 With regard to vitamin D, some studies have failed to detect a statistically significant interaction, 32,36 while others have reported an interaction with either EBV antibodies or DNA load. 37 Mechanistically, observations that there is overlap between EBNA-2a and vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding sites within MS-associated genomic regions and that EBNA-3 binds to the VDR may provide further insights. 24, 38 In neuroimaging studies, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) markers of MS activity and grey matter atrophy were found to be associated with anti-EBV antibody levels. 39, 40 At the cellular level, CD8 + T cells specific for EBV lytic and latent antigens were more frequent in patients with active and inactive MS, respectively. 41 Deep sequencing of T-cell receptor\u03b2 genes (\"immunosequencing\") showed intrathecally enriched EBV-reactive CD8 + T cells that were specific to patients with MS. 42 Furthermore, in animal models using lymphocryptovirus (LCV), which is a close relative of EBV, LCV-infected B cells lost their ability to process the extrinsic pathogenic CD8 + T-cell epitope in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). In doing so, they cross-presented this epitope to auto-aggressive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, a reaction that can initiate an autoimmune reaction and demyelination. 43 With regard to humoral immunity, the high antibody titres against EBNA proteins in patients with MS might be due to intrathecal synthesis but it has yet to be clarified whether they result from highfrequency latent EBV-infected cells or, alternatively, have a concrete pathogenic role. 44 Conversely, patients with IM showed activation of MOG-specific memory B cells. 45 Furthermore, EBV genetic material has been identified in the CSF and perivenular infiltrates of brain and spinal cord white matter, and, more recently, in the cortical grey matter and cervical lymph nodes of patients with MS. 44,46 EBV brain infection is likely to be limited to only a small number of B cells (approximately 5-3000 per 10 7 memory B cells). 23, 47 This could explain why histological studies for their detection are difficult, and it underscores the need for technologies such as massively parallel single-cell sequencing to detect these rare events in the future. 48 Dual infection with EBV types 1 and 2 is more common in patients with MS compared to single infection. 49 Mechanistically, EBV might act as an environmental trigger or by attacking the CNS. 50 With respect to the former, an EAE model with the murine EBV homologue gamma-herpesvirus 68 showed more pronounced MS-like clinicopathological features that were dependent on the latent life cycle of the virus. 51 There are a number of theories with regard to the latter mechanism of direct CNS destruction by the virus: MS results from EBV infection of autoreactive B cells, which in turn produces pathogenic autoantibodies 44 ; (iv) the \"mistaken self\" hypothesis based on proteomic analyses shows a higher frequency of a peptide corresponding to an EBNA-1 region sharing homology with the N-terminus of \u03b1B-crystallin in patients with MS. 52 Overall, understanding these mechanisms paves the way for novel anti-MS strategies, notably EBV-specific adoptive immunotherapy. 22 It is also mechanistically intriguing how EBV plays a role in both cancer-a disorder of cellular proliferation-and MS-a disease characterized by neuronal cell death; however, recent reports of a genetic overlap between the EBV-related Hodgkin lymphoma and MS could shed some light on this. 53, 54 In parallel, dogma that EBV cannot possibly be found in glial cells or neurons, the host immune response must remain the focus of studies, 53 or that EBV latency status underpins virus-mediated pathogenesis 24 should be re-examined in the light of recent observations that EBV can cause lytic infection in human primary neurons. 55 To summarize, in the context of discordance between the high rates of EBV infection vs low rates of MS worldwide, EBV is likely to be necessary but not sufficient to cause MS. 19 Future studies on shared polygenic risk from genomewide association studies on MS cases with those with markers of increased EBV levels (eg EBNA-1 56 ) are likely to shed further light on such host-pathogen interactions.",

            "text": "A recent, inconclusive, non-systematic summary of evidence on the role of HHV-6 in MS 57 highlighted the need for a formal meta-analysis on this topic. Furthermore, although HHV-6 has been detected mostly in acute demyelinating brain lesions in MS, detection rates are highly variable (HHV-6 DNA in the CSF ranging from 3% to 46% of patients). 58 Additionally, other markers such as B-or T-cell reactivity, higher antibody responses or higher viral loads have not been consistently observed in MS patients' serum in different ethnic groups or prospective studies. 57, 59 Some specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; eg in CD46 and MHC2TA) are strongly associated with active replication of HHV-6 and, together, with worse clinical prognosis in MS. 60 At the edge of such gene-environment interactions lie the HERVs (see below). One of their subtypes (HERV-K18) was shown to be activated by HHV-6A, mainly in cell lines productively infected with the virus and followed by those with latently infected virus. These observations reinforce the notion that there is a common HERV-mediated pathway downstream of viral infection in MS, 61 which might be therapeutically exploitable. 62 The marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) HHV-6 model has been used to study viral neurotropism. 63 Interestingly, in contrast to how the virus seems to gain entry to the human CNS via olfactory pathways, 64 findings in marmosets revealed that only those with intravenous (and not intranasal) inoculation of HHV-6A (and not HHV-6B) developed neurological disease. 63 Furthermore, in contrast to the global seroprevalence of >95% for HHV-6B, HHV-6A is more frequent in patients with MS than HHV-6B, which is certainly worthy of further investigation. 57 HHV-6A infection leads to apoptosis in the brain, induces autoimmunity in several ways 65 and activates antiviral genes in human astrocytes including some genes upregulated in MS. 66 ",

VZV seropositivity was not significantly higher in patients with MS vs controls in two studies. 71, 72 Moreover, while VZV DNA was identified in the CSF of patients with MS (particularly of RR type) in some studies, 73, 74 others failed to confirm these findings in the CSF, blood or in acute MS lesions. 58, [75] [76] [77] More consistently, however, are the observations that the high levels of VZV DNA in CSF and PBMCs during relapse ultimately disappear during clinical remission. 78, 79 Interestingly, the progressive MS type has been associated with VZV DNA at levels between those found during the relapse and remission periods of the RR-MS type. 79, 80 The median fraction of intrathecal VZV-specific IgG of total IgG can differentiate patients with MS from those with VZV reactivation (35-fold higher in the latter). 81 This observation implies that low-level infection is present in at least some MS cases. It also helps address whether or not VZV detection in MS is due to reactivated, previously latent VZV infection; that is, \"centripetal infection\" from the neural ganglia towards the CNS. 82 Another theory suggests that VZV in MS is purely epiphenomenal due to leakage from destroyed sensory neurons; however, experimental evidence is lacking. 83 Also, VZV has not been identified in \"traditional\" autoimmune diseases, implying a more specific connection with MS. 82 Finally, VZV antigens induced and maintained activity of HERVs in peripheral lymphocytes from patients with MS compared to controls; retroviruses, as explained below, are implicated as causal in MS. 84 ",

            "text": "Although initially both were implicated in MS pathology since the 1980s, subsequent studies have continued to support a role for endogenous rather than exogenous retroviruses in MS. 85 HERVs were integrated into the human genome relatively recently in evolutionary terms, that is some 30-40 million years ago, as a result of ancestral retroviral infections. In humans, they form up to 8% of the genome and constitute a notable category of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. These transposable elements, also known as \"jumping genes,\" change position within a genome and have repetitive sequences, explaining why it is more difficult to investigate their inheritance with classical genetics approaches. 86 Despite these difficulties, the estimated 320 000 transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) regulated by HERVs underscore their genomewide role. Deciphering their pathophysiological roles will offer further insights into the molecular basis of disease beyond that offered by focusing exclusively on the exome. 87, 88 Putative mechanisms of HERV-related pathophysiology in MS are illustrated in Figure There is also an established body of evidence that the envelope protein of the \"MS-associated retrovirus\" (MSRV-Env) in the HERV-W family is causal for MS. 94 Initially observed in leptomeningeal cells, the MRSV-Env protein has been detected in MS plaques containing macrophages, microglia and perivascular cells in actively demyelinating lesions and in the astrocytes of inactive areas but not in control brains. 95 High MRSV-Env DNA copy number, transcript and antigen levels have recently been detected in the blood of over 70% of patients with MS 96 ; the increased DNA copy number is indicative of HERV-related reverse transcriptase activity. Earlier studies suggested potential MRSV-Env selectivity for the MS brain after observations of viral genetic material present at higher levels in the brain than in the blood of the same patients. 97 HERV-W Env expression is also increased on the surface of B cells and monocytes during the active phase of MS and parallels MS exacerbations. 98 This protein, a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist, stimulates immune cells and enhances expression of markers of leucocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. The above raises interesting questions about the effect of MRSV-Env on blood-brain barrier integrity. 99 In parallel, HERV-W Env impairs remyelination by inhibiting the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors to myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, potentially due to nitrosative stress. 100 The HERV-W glycoprotein syncytin-1 also seems to be implicated in MS via a similar mechanism; it causes an endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor to induce inducible nitric oxygen synthase and, concomitantly, the release of oligodendrocyte cytotoxins by astrocytes (for further details, see 101 ). Also, HERVs can induce EAE in mice, implying a role upstream of other mediators. 102 Therefore, HERVs seem to be implicated in both the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease, rendering them promising therapeutic targets.",

However, investigating its role in MS is more difficult due to low titres and short presence of LCMV in the CSF. 131 In our opinion, this might indicate a \"hit-and-run\" mechanism. On the other hand, recent in silico predictions show high sequence and structural similarity between LCMV's nucleoprotein and specific myelin basic protein (MBP) residues. 132 Murine models of chronic LCMV infection have given rise to two Nobel Prizes. 131 The virus is thought to activate microglia and astrocytes in the CNS via a TLR2-mediated cascade. 133 Moreover, LCMV blocks induction of type 1 interferon and consequential upregulation of HLA class II. This observation supports a potential virus-induced disturbance in the interferon-tumour necrosis factor balance, which is already known to trigger autoimmunity. 132 Interestingly, LCMV infection limited to the periphery with concurrent CNS measles virus infection can induce CNS pathology via LCMV-specific CD8 + T-cell recruitment to the brain without the need for LCMV replication. The underlying reason why the brain, broadly considered \"immuno-privileged\", attracts these mis-recruited cells needs further exploration. 134 ",
