During the time-course of the pandemic, it became obvious that the H1N1-virus seldom causes severe illness [1]. H1N1 is known to induce fulminant courses in youths and young adults [1]. However, as described for other infectious diseases\u2014e.g., the seasonal flu\u2014pregnant women are at a higher risk of infection than the rest of the population. The frequency of complications and dangerous courses is also higher among pregnant women [1]. The early start of an anti-viral therapy is essential for successful treatment. Therefore, the diagnosis of an H1N1-infection should be made as swiftly as possible [1].",

The patient reported a history of mild chronic bronchitis and smoking. Clinical findings: the patient suffered from upper respiratory tract symptoms (throat complaints and cough). The physical examination of heart, lung and abdomen revealed no pathological findings except a pain at both renal beds. Ultrasound examination and urine test was inconspicuous. Circulation and oxygenation was normal. There were no signs of meningism or neurological deficits. All pregnancy related findings were inconspicuous. The patient progressively developed dyspnea with cyanosis. Throat complaints were relieved during antibiotic therapy with Cefuroxim and Erythromycin. However, the patient proceeded to develop respiratory insufficiency and had to be intubated on the fifth day due to rapidly decreasing oxygen saturation. Coincidentally, a progressive pancytopenia and increasing inflammatory activity was recorded. Echocardiography, blood cultures, and bronchial lavage brought no pathological findings, but CT revealed ARDS and hepatomegaly (see Fig. 1). Recent human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalic virus, herpes simplex virus, classical influenza and parainfluenza infections were excluded. An H1N1-infection was confirmed by PCR on the sixth day. The antiviral therapy was changed from zanamivir to oseltamivir on the ninth. On the fifth day after admission to the hospital extracorporeal membrane, oxygenation became necessary because of insufficient oxygen saturation by mechanical ventilation. At this time, the course of pregnancy seemed to be unimpaired. The fetus was suddenly spontaneously expulsed on the seventh day (weight 460 g, no anomalies detectable). In the absence of bleeding, curettage post abort was not necessary. As a result of the antiviral therapy, H1N1-DNA was not detectable at day 16. Despite all the efforts, the respiratory situation was not improved significantly.\n",

This provides further evidence to the notion that pregnant women are at a high risk for dangerous and complicated courses of H1N1-infections: H1N1 has a predilection for younger pregnant women. The maternal age of severe (H1N1) infections ranged from 15 to 44 years (median age 26 years) and with more than two parity and gravidity in their history [2]. Most women were in the first or second trimester of pregnancy [2]. Comorbidities\u2013here, a mild chronic bronchitis\u2013increase the risk for a severe course of the H1N1-infection [2, 3]. In this recent case, the patient was hospitalized with clinical symptoms of a pyelonephritis gravidarum although bacteriuria was not detected. However, the initial course of therapy seemed to indicate the correctness of the diagnosis since several symptoms and laboratory values improved antibiotic therapy. The diagnosis of H1N1 infections was delayed because important symptoms were masked by other common pregnancy complications.",

It is well known that early introduction of anti-viral therapy (oseltamivir or zanamivir) improves the chances for successful treatment of patients that are high at risk. It should be kept in mind that the time from symptom onset to initial presentation for clinical care usually ranges from 1 to 7 days (median 3.5 days [2]). In median, antiviral treatment is started at 6.5 days [3]. Delayed treatment is associated with admission to an intensive care unit or death [3]. 19% of the intensive care unit admissions in relation to pregnancy are due to ARDS [4]. Severe pneumonia and ARDS are the most important complications of influenza [2, 3, 5]. ARDS secondary to influenza A (H1N1) infection is characterized by severe hypoxemia and need for mechanical ventilation, but there is no preferred mode of ventilation for ARDS in pregnancy [6]. Altogether, 226,136 laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1) virus infections were announced in Germany until April 2010 [5].",
