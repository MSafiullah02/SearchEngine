Across vertebrates the mitogenome shows a largely conserved gene content and synteny, containing 13 protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and a control region. Protein coding genes encode essential subunits of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, while the tRNA and rRNA genes encode components of the mitochondrial translation machinery. The mitogenome is maternally inherited, is non-recombining and has a higher mutation rate than the nuclear genome1,2. These properties have made it an attractive study locus for phylogenetics, population genetics and forensics. The mitochondria have also been the focus of ageing research since the 1950s due to their central role in the \u201cFree Radical Theory of Ageing\u201d3.",

ROS are generated when electrons leak from the ETC and reduce oxygen in the absence of hydrogen cations. The mitogenome was once thought to be particularly susceptible to oxidative damage due to its lack of protective histones and close proximity to the ETC, though it is now known that the mtDNA is not naked. Rather, the mtDNA and the TFAM protein compact to form DNA-protein aggregates, called nucleoids, which in mammals typically contain a single mitogenome2,4,5. These oxidative mutations become hardcoded in the mitogenome, leading to production of mutated ETC components, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Increased mitochondrial dysfunction gives rise to greater ROS production, which cause greater dysfunction in a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d. This gradual accumulation of heteroplasmy and dysfunctional mitochondria is thought to give rise to the familiar progressive, ageing phenotype5\u20137.",

Mitogenomes may vary in length or at single nucleotides, referred to as length and point heteroplasmy respectively, where a locus is defined as heteroplasmic if it is heterozygous within an individual and the minor allele frequency (MAF) exceeding some defined threshold. Heteroplasmy plays an important role in mitochondrial disease, cancer and ageing7,9\u201311. Once thought to be extremely rare in human populations, recent next generation sequencing efforts have found extensive heteroplasmy in healthy individuals12. These heteroplasmies are predominantly at low frequency, enriched for pathogenic mutations, and show tissue and allele specific patterns13\u201315. As the mitochondrial genome is maternally inherited, studies of mother-child pairs have shown that maternal age at conception is positively correlated with levels of heteroplasmy16. More generally, levels of heteroplasmy have been shown to increase with age in humans, and contribute to debilitating age related diseases, as well as developmental disorders such as autism10,13,15,17.",

            "text": "The correlated increase in low level heteroplasmies with age in humans seems to support the FRTA. However, human studies have shown a lack of oxidative transversions but instead show transitions are the primary source of mtDNA mutations13,15,18. Further, numerous studies have challenged the FRTA. Knock down of key antioxidant defences has been shown to have often contradictory effects on lifespan19. The long lived naked mole rat has been found to have higher levels of oxidative damage than other rodents, and has lost important antioxidant enzymes20,21. However, these studies have not directly measured mitochondrial DNA damage, and apart from humans, little is known about low level heteroplasmy in mammals. Studies involving mutant mouse models have been used to test the relationship between mitochondrial mutations and ageing. POLG\u2212/\u2212 mice express a mitochondrial polymerase with no proof reading activity22,23 and so accumulate mitochondrial mutations faster than wild type mice. These mice show a strong progeroid phenotype, supporting a role for mitochondrial mutations in ageing23,24. Mammalian studies have been restricted to the control region, often in repeat containing loci, and have not investigated any potential relationship with age25\u201332. Moreover, few comparative studies have taken advantage of recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies. Recently, Rensch et al.1 used publicly available ChIP-Seq data from 16 species to evaluate patterns of heteroplasmy across the vertebrate phylogeny and concluded that divergent species show similar patterns in frequency and location of heteroplasmy. This study discovered relatively few heteroplasmies, likely due to the high frequency cut off used, and few individuals available for some species. They did not investigate change in heteroplasmy levels with age. To date, next generation sequencing methods have not been used to investigate the relationship between heteroplasmy and age outside of humans.",

During flight the metabolic rate in bats is up to 3 times higher than that of a terrestrial mammal of the same size during exercise39. Bats can increase oxygen consumption 20\u201330 fold during flight, and M. velifer has been shown to increase oxygen consumption rate 130 fold39,40. According to the FRTA, increased oxygen consumption as a result of flight should lead to increased ROS production, thereby accelerating the ageing process. However, bats seem to defy the FRTA33,41. M. lucifugus has been shown to produce less ROS per unit of oxygen consumed compared to mammals of a similar size, suggesting Myotis bats have increased \u201cmitochondrial efficiency\u201d and have potentially evolved some mechanism to avoid or manage flight-induced oxidative stress42.",

They found high levels of diversity within individuals at a tandem repeat between the tRNA Proline and the conserved sequence blocks of the control region. Sequence diversity at this locus within individuals was similar to diversity between colonies from Germany and Portugal. The length of the repeated array also varied at this locus between and within individuals, with approximately 40% of individuals showing at least two different size arrays. Kerth et al.43 studied the homologous repeat array in M. bechsteinii from Germany and exploited the high levels of sequence and length diversity in this array to study \u201cmicrogeographic\u201d population structuring in these bats. This locus has been suggested to possibly regulate mitochondrial transcription due to homology with termination-associated sequences leading to a complex secondary structure32,44. However, this repeat locus is found only in the Vespertilioninae and Myotinae subfamilies44,45, and so cannot apply generally to exceptional longevity across the chiropteran phylogeny. Heteroplasmy has also been studied outside the Vespertilionidae. The distantly related Rhinolophus sinicus has was found to exhibit point and length heteroplasmy. As in the studies in vespertilionid bats, heteroplasmy was observed at a tandem repeat in the control region using PCR and cloning based techniques25. So far, no study has used next generation sequencing to investigate low frequency heteroplasmy across the whole mitogenome in a long-lived bat species, or tested if heteroplasmy shows any association with age in bats.",

We report, for the first time, population level characterization of heteroplasmy based on whole mitogenomes from 195 tagged individuals of the long-lived bat, M. myotis. Polymerase error likely explains the majority of mutations, with oxidative transversions at a lower rate and concentrated in only a few individuals. Most heteroplasmies are at low frequency, less than 5%. We also sampled and sequenced individuals over multiple years, to assess changes in levels of heteroplasmy at the individual level through time. These unique samples revealed the dynamic nature of heteroplasmy, possibly as a consequence of transient oxidative stress. Contrary to the FRTA, we found that M. myotis do not suffer widespread oxidative damage due to flight, instead exhibit acute and transient oxidative stress. We suggest enhanced mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, which may repair or remove damaged mitochondria possibly contributes to the exceptional longevity in M. myotis.",

The model incorporated age as the sole fixed effect and included sequencing batch as a random effect, with the count of heteroplasmic sites as the negative binomial distributed response variable. Sequencing batch was included as samples from different batches exhibited significantly different numbers of heteroplasmies (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.007). However, the magnitude of the difference in means was small, with a maximum difference of 1.7 heteroplasmies between two batches. Furthermore, batch as a random effect had an estimated variance of 0, indicating the model was degenerate. As such, the simpler generalized linear model with age as the sole fixed effect was retained for further analysis (Table 3). Two samples within the 6+ cohort were found to be unduly influential points using Cook\u2019s Statistic (Supp. Fig. 3A,B). As such they were removed and the model fit again. With these two samples removed no significant association with age was found (ANOVA, p = 0.1), as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 3. Bootstrapping of the three fitted models also showed a decrease in the standard error and bias for the model estimates with the outliers removed, Table 3. Further, the two outlier samples contained primarily oxidative mutations, one of which contains the highest number of oxidative mutations in our data. To investigate any bias that may be introduced by choosing the most recent sample from recaptured individuals, we produced 1000 permutations in which the sample from recaptured individuals of usable age was chosen at random, to produce a similar dataset of 165 unique individuals. 19.8% of samplings found a significant association between age and number of heteroplasmies (Supp. Fig. 4A), with an average slope 0.0969 and ranging from 0.0815 to 0.1237 (Supp. Fig. 4B).",

Four individuals showing spikes in the number of heteroplasmy, with an increase of 4 or more sites between two subsequent years, were previously found to have some of the highest levels of oxidative mutations. Interestingly, bat 000702EA84 showed a spike in heteroplasmy with little recovery the following year.

However, though mitochondrial dysfunction and heteroplasmy have been long implicated in ageing, there remains a paucity of data from non-human or non-model organisms to associate increased heteroplasmy as a mechanism underpinning the progressive, ageing phenotype. To this end, for the first time we have deep sequenced, to an average depth of >3500X, whole mitogenomes from 195 M. myotis individuals, and investigated the association between heteroplasmy and age in these long-lived bats. After outlier removal, we found no evidence for an increase in heteroplasmy with age. We also found little to no evidence to support the Free Radical Theory of Ageing, finding no chronic increase in oxidative mutations with age. Through unique, longitudinal sampling we found bats may experience local oxidative stress events followed by removal of the majority of mutations. Nonsynonymous, protein coding mutations were also at a significantly lower frequency than synonymous, and those with predicted deleterious effects were lower again. Together our results suggest M. myotis may remove deleterious mitochondrial DNA mutations, preventing their expansion, to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis, and possibly promoting longevity. This hypothesis will need further investigation.",

However, many studies have shown a dearth of oxidative mutations in mitochondrial DNA48. Studies in model and long-lived non-model organisms have also led many to question this central tenets of the FRTA19,48\u201350. We found little support for the FRTA in M. myotis. Transitions, not oxidative transversions, are the primary source of mutation. Transitions are likely due to errors during DNA replication or spontaneous deamination of nucleosides, rather than damage accrued by oxidative stress4,7. Still, the proportion of heteroplasmies owing to oxidative transversions in M. myotis mitochondrial DNA is much higher than reported in humans13,15. However, the majority of these oxidative mutations were concentrated in only a few individuals. These likely represent local oxidative stress events, rather than a population wide phenomenon. The longitudinal data supports this interpretation as two individuals exhibiting high numbers of oxidative transversions, and some of the highest levels of heteroplasmy, were also sampled the following year (individuals 000702E6B0 and 000702FF51, Fig. 3). They had cleared or repaired the majority of the oxidative damage, though each retained at least one of the heteroplasmies from the previous year. We suggest M. myotis experience local, transient oxidative stress followed by return to homeostasis and removal or repair of oxidative lesions.",

Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has also been shown to promote ROS production52. It has been suggested that bats have a constitutively active innate immune system, possibly explaining their unique ability to act as reservoirs for diverse viruses, such as SARS, which can be pathogenic in humans and other mammals54\u201357. The constitutive expression of interferon or the presence of circulating viruses in bats may lead to acute levels of ROS production in bats enabling them to quickly mediate infection58,59. The long lived bat species, Carollia perspicillata, has also been shown to experience increased oxidative stress during simulated bacterial infection60. Potentially, individuals showing increased oxidative damage were experiencing immune related oxidative stress at the time of sampling, although this remains to be tested. This may also suggest that spikes in oxidative transversions are also a blood specific phenomenon; future studies incorporating different tissues may shed light on the role and effect of ROS in the bat immune system.",

Under the disposable soma theory of ageing, reallocation of resources from self-maintenance to reproductive effort leads to increased damage of somatic tissue during reproductive phases, with unrepaired damage accumulating with time51,61. The spikes in oxidative damage followed by recovery as observed in our longitudinal sampling, showed while most oxidative damage observed during the spike were eventually lost or removed, some mutations persisted, and could be detected the following year.

            "text": "The question remains, how do bats maintain their efficient mitochondria, and how might this lead to an increased lifespan? Our data shows no support for flight induced oxidative damage accumulating in M. myotis. However, oxidative stress is observed in numerous individuals, and those with samples from subsequent time-points suggest possible removal of the majority of mutations, suggesting mitochondrial stress followed by repair or removal of damaged mitochondria. Further, nonsynonymous mutations were at significantly lower frequency than synonymous, suggesting purifying selection acting on these heteroplasmies. Nonsynonymous sites predicted to be deleterious were even lower in frequency again than those with little or no functional impact. This suggests M. myotis may prevent expansion of deleterious, nonsynonymous mutations which has been shown to contribute to the ageing phenotype in human and mouse models23,62. This may further contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial function with age.",

            "text": "There are multiple mechanisms by which M. myotis may remove and prevent expansion of mitochondrial mutations. One such mechanism is through direct repair of DNA damage. DNA repair genes and pathways have been shown to be evolving or expressed differently in bats compared to other mammals63\u201365, however, many of these pathways are not active in the mitochondria. Base excision repair (BER) is the primary method of DNA repair in mitochondria. While double strand break repair operates in mitochondria, the mechanisms have not been fully characterised4. Another mechanism by which M. myotis may remove oxidative damage is through mitophagy. Mitophagy is a form of autophagy through which cells remove dysfunctional mitochondria. Inhibition of autophagy, and so mitophagy, by knockdown of autophagosome genes has also been shown to lead to increased ROS production48. Mitochondria derived ROS have also been shown to promote autophagy during starvation, through oxidation and inactivation of the ATG4 protein66. Long lived bats have also been shown to have increased macroautophagy activity in comparison to a short-lived, phylogenetically close sister taxa. Interestingly, other homeostatic mechanisms such as chaperone protein levels and proteasome activity, showed no difference in long and short-lived bats67. This suggests long-lived bats rely on autophagy for maintaining homeostasis. Indeed, previous studies have shown that autophagy genes are upregulated in the blood of M. myotis compared to other mammals65. Coupled with our results, this suggests M. myotis may possess stringent mitochondrial quality control to prevent accumulation and expansion of deleterious mutations, contrary to what has been shown in humans13,15,16. Continued longitudinal sampling and experimental validation are necessary to determine if these mechanisms truly prevent or limit accumulation of heteroplasmies with age in M. myotis. Also, further comparative studies are needed to ascertain if this \u2018maintenance phenotype\u2019 is common across Chiroptera and amongst other long lived species.",

Instead, oxidative mutations were not the primary source of mutations and most seemed to be transient, arising from local oxidative stress events before disappearing. We did not find that accumulation of heteroplasmic sites in the mitogenome increases with age in these bats, however, we have only analysed a small portion of the lifespan of this species. Unique longitudinal sampling revealed the dynamic nature of heteroplasmy, with some bats gaining or losing up to 6 heteroplasmies between consecutive years. These drastic shifts in heteroplasmy suggest increases in heteroplasmy may not only be tolerable but removable in M. myotis. We propose that stringent mitochondrial quality control mechanisms drives mitochondrial health, potentially contributing to the exceptional longevity of M. myotis.",

Samples were trimmed of Illumina and Nextera adapter sequences using Cutadapt (v1.8.3)70 and The NGS QC Toolkit71 was used to filter out reads for which 80% of bases had quality scores less than Q30. Due to extreme sequence depths at small target regions in resequencing studies, it is possible that inserts will begin and end at the same position due to chance, called sampling coincidence. Reads from such inserts will be falsely identified as PCR duplicates. However, not removing true PCR duplicates may affect the accuracy of variant calling. In order to remove any potential bias introduced by duplicate removal or retention, we ran the heteroplasmy detection pipeline with duplicates present and removed. As some samples showed extremely high levels of variation between treatments we used the interquartile range to identify and remove outliers. An outlier was defined as any value for which the count value was 2 interquartile ranges below the first quartile or above the third quartile. The mean and standard deviation of these filtered counts was then calculated. A cut-off value of two standard deviations from the mean was rounded down to the nearest integer value. Samples with a difference in counts between the two treatments, which was greater than this cut-off were deemed unreliable and removed from downstream analysis. Finally, average coverage was calculated for each sample using the depth command in samtools (v0.1.19)72. As all variant callers exhibited power below 80% at coverage below 1000X (Fig. 2), samples with an average coverage below this threshold were removed.",

Default cut-offs were used such that a mutation was binned as \u201cDeleterious\u201d if the computed PROVEAN Score was greater than 2.5 or less than \u22122.580,81. Frequency distributions for each bin were compared using a two tailed non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test or Mann-Whitney U-test.

The number of heteroplasmies for samples was compared between sequencing batches using Kruskal-Wallis test. The primary dataset was used to test for a significant association between number of heteroplasmic sites and age by fitting a generalised liner mixed model (GLMM) in R (v3.3.3) using the \u201clme4\u201d package82 with age as the only fixed effect and incorporating sequencing batch as a random effect, and number of heteroplasmic sites as the response variable modelled under a negative binomial distribution. A negative binomial distribution was used due the presence of overdispersion in the data making a Poisson distribution unsuitable. Subsequently a generalised linear model (GLM) was fit using the \u201cMASS\u201d package83 with age as the sole explanatory variable. The \u201cboot\u201d package84,85 in R (v3.3.3) was used to diagnose samples which may be unduly influential points using the Cook Statistic86. Influential points were removed and the model was fitted again. 1000 bootstrap replicates were generated for each fitted model by randomly sampling with replacement from the datasets using the \u201cboot\u201d package in R. The standard error and bias for the Intercept and Age estimates were recorded. To investigate any bias that may be introduced by manually selecting a sample from recaptured individuals, we performed 1000 samplings in which the sample from recaptured individuals of usable age was chosen at random, to produce 1000 datasets (of n = 165) and the model fit again.",
