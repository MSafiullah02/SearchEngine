Results confirm RSV as the most frequent agent, but also highlight the potential significance of other viruses such as adenovirus, hMPV and PIV 3 in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Given the presence of viral co-infections in RSV bronchiolitis, it is important to recognize the potential limitations of rapid RSV testing alone. Being so, we consider the strategy of sequential testing for respiratory virus a little dangerous, because it will certainly miss the detection in some cases. In the market there are RT-PCR kits that perform the tests rapidly using only one sample.",
