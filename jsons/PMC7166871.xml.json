The legal DOI is based on experimental evidence, represents a minimum value and need not reflect the true DOI of a vaccine. Most companion animal vaccines, until recently, had a 1 year DOI and carried a recommendation for annual revaccination. The sensible response of industry to recent discussions about vaccine safety has been to increasingly license products with an \u2018extended\u2019 (generally 3 year) DOI.

Consequently, guidelines advice will often differ from that given in the data sheet; however, any veterinarian may use a vaccine according to guidelines (and therefore current scientific thinking) by obtaining informed (and documented) owner consent for this deviation from legal recommendations (\u2018off\u2010label use\u2019).

The VGG recognizes that particular countries will identify additional vaccines that they consider core. A particular example of a vaccine that may be considered core in only some countries is that against rabies virus. In a geographical area in which this infection is endemic all dogs should be routinely vaccinated for the protection of both the pet and human populations. In some countries, mandatory rabies vaccination is a legal requirement, and is generally also required for international pet travel. Non\u2010core vaccines are those that are licensed for the dog and whose use is determined on the basis of the animal\u2019s geographical and lifestyle exposure and an assessment of risk\u2010benefit ratios.

No single primary vaccination policy will therefore cover all possible situations. The recommendation of the VGG is for initial vaccination at 8\u20139 weeks of age followed by a second vaccination 3\u20134 weeks later, and a third vaccination given between 14\u201316 weeks of age. By contrast, at present many vaccine data sheets recommend an initial course of two injections. Some products are also licensed with a \u201810 week finish\u2019 designed such that the second of two vaccinations is given at 10 weeks of age. The rationale behind this protocol is to permit \u2018early socialization\u2019 of pups. The VGG recognizes that this is of great benefit to the behavioural development of dogs. Where such protocols are adopted, great caution should still be maintained by the owner \u2013 allowing restricted exposure of the pup to controlled areas and only to other pups that are healthy and fully vaccinated.

It is believed (but unproven) that the high susceptibility to CPV\u20102 recognized in certain Rottweilers and Dobermans during the 1980s (regardless of their vaccination history) was due to a high prevalence of non\u2010responders. In the USA today, these two breeds seem to have no greater numbers of non\u2010responders to CPV\u20102 than other breeds, possibly because carriers of the genetic trait may have died from CPV\u20102 infection. Some dogs of these breeds may be low or non\u2010responders to other antigens. For example, in the UK and Germany, the non\u2010responder phenotype is prevalent amongst Rottweilers for CPV\u20102 and rabies virus as recent studies have shown this breed to have a higher proportion of animals failing to achieve the titre of rabies antibody required for pet travel.",

It is known that dogs often maintain protective antibody to CDV, CPV\u20102, CAV\u20101, and CAV\u20102 for three or more years and numerous experimental studies support this observation. Therefore, when antibody is absent (irrespective of the serological test used) the dog should be revaccinated unless there is a medical basis for not so doing. Antibody determinations to other vaccine components are of limited or no value because of the short time period these antibodies persist (e.g. Leptospira products) or the lack of correlation between serum antibody and protection (e.g. Leptospira or canine parainfluenza). Important considerations in performing antibody tests are the cost and the time to obtain results.",

Therapeutically, the serum or immunoglobulin preparations are injected subcutaneously and quickly reach the circulation.

In local infections, such as those initiated by the bite wound of a rabid carnivore, post\u2010exposure antibody prophylaxis has also proven invaluable. Human rabies immune globulin provides rapid protection when given on the first day of the post\u2010exposure prophylaxis regimen.

Nutritional, dental disease, and parasite control assessment and counselling should take place on an individualized basis throughout the life of the pet. There is no evidence that older dogs and cats, which have been fully vaccinated as pups or kittens, require a specialized programme of core vaccination. Experimental evidence shows that aged dogs and cats have persisting immunological memory to core vaccines that is readily boosted by administration of a single vaccine dose. By contrast, aged animals may not be as efficient at mounting primary immune responses to novel antigens that they have not previously encountered. Studies of UK dogs and cats vaccinated for the first time against rabies for pet travel have clearly shown that more aged animals fail to achieve the legally required antibody titre.",
