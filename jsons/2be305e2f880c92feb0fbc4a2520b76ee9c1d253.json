Any organization has a limited information-processing capacity. This chapter considers what a strategist needs to know in order to make good strategy. It stresses the nature of strategy making as a learning process and an organization as a learning institution. The major area of ignorance is what will happen in the future. Since most of the life of any organization lies in the future, this is important. There is no way of avoiding the problem of uncertainty about the future.

It is not simply that they know fully their own preference map (their ranking Construction, or generation, of alternatives of consumer goods) and the price of all products, but that they apply a set of easily deducible criteria to decision making, one which includes consistency. A typical approach which illustrates the weakness of an overreliance on rationality is the notion of an efficient price. Indeed this notion is one which assumes that the actual price existing in any market reflects all the relevant information on both demand and supply conditions available at that time. It is efficient in that sense.

Even a continuous range can be reduced to a finite number of possibilities, with some having markedly higher probabilities than others. The chosen scenarios are initially seen as equally likely to occur. The key issue is the underlying structure of cause and effect which defines the separate outcomes. Usually it is enough to generate a minimum of two, three or four scenarios from which to select the most likely outcomes, but which also allow decision makers to accommodate other possible scenarios, should they be realized.

Falling prices create a much more difficult scenario for most decision makers than rising prices, particularly if there is a high level of debt in an economy.

In theory it is not difficult for governments to prevent an economy moving into the deflation zone. If the government allows the economy to move into the deflationary zone, it is difficult to reverse the movement since it becomes self-reinforcing as consumers postpone purchases to take advantage of lower prices later and react to a declining wealth effect. As Keynes rightly pointed out many years ago, there is a liquidity trap since it is impossible to shift interest rates below a minimum threshold level, which might be zero or something close to it. Deflation keeps the real rate of interest above zero even if institutions literally give away the money at zero interest.

Change over time would be represented by shifts in the curves. For example, the situation for oil might be as follows. As world demand increases with world output, the demand curve shifts upwards. The rate of shift is likely to reflect the rate of substitution of other sources of energy for oil. As new sources of supply are found, this tends to push outwards the supply curve, but it can be countered by using up existing reserves. ",

In the first case, the supply curve is horizontal at the given price, that is, infinitely elastic with respect to price. In the second case, the supply curve is vertical at the given quantity, that is, has zero elasticity with respect to price. The former better represents the behaviour of OPEC. If the non-OPEC producers are willing to sell at a lower price than OPEC, the supply curve will be well-behaved up to the point at which the OPEC price cuts in.

A generation of airliners must have a long life in order to allow production to cover fixed costs. The present generation is 20-30 years old. To break even on a new airplane requires sales of 400-500 planes, at a rate of about 50 a year over a 10-year period.

Subcontracting, which accounted for less than 10% of operations in the 1930s, rose to 30-40% in the 1950s and to 60-70% by the 1970s. Only those processes which are critical to the core competencies basic to the manufacture of an aircraft have been retained. Others which are not critical are outsourced to those with the relevant core competency. This is partly in order to reduce cost and create flexibility, and partly to raise the quality of components. It is also a method of risk sharing. The component producers share the cost of failure. Sometimes there is a desire to share design and production work with firms located in the countries of purchase of the airliners, so as to be better able to sell the airliners to the local airlines.",

If the sales are 100 then the fixed costs per aircraft are $120 million for each plane. If the variable costs are $100 million per plane when 100 are built, probably conservative for such a pioneering aircraft, then the total cost of a plane will be $220 million. If the sales are 200, then the fixed costs fall to $60 million and the total cost to $160 million. If the sales rise to 300 then the fixed costs fall to $40 million and the total costs are $140 million.

In such circumstances there is always the possibility of cooperation but also the possibility of opportunism and deception. This is very much a prisoner's dilemma situation (see Chapter 13). The decision by Airbus to develop a new super jumbo aircraft which will hold more than 500 passengers is bound to have an impact on Boeing. Boeing, which would have preferred to stay with its existing 747-400, which carried up to 414 passengers, was forced to respond. Initially it responded with a plan for an extended 747, the 747X. Boeing pioneered the habit of stretching basic planes. In this case the 747 would be stretched to 550 seats, with improved wing aerodynamics and fly-by-wire technology. Such a project, if implemented, would cost it only one-quarter to one-third the cost of the A380 project. However, it soon realized that this was not enough. Boeing had become excessively cautious, whereas before it had kept ahead of the field by being the pioneer. It tried to leapfrog ahead of Airbus by making public a much more advanced project. It responded with the sonic cruiser, in essence a revival of an old supersonic project. However, this project never really took off, and the focus is now on the Dreamliner, a more efficient mid-sized aircraft.",

This means a loss of $70 million per plane at a run of 100, a profit of just $10 million per plane at 200 and a significant profit of $60 million per plane at 400. This ignores the timing of costs, mostly incurred early, very early for fixed costs, and revenue, mostly flowing late in the project, as much as five, ten or even twenty years after completion of development. On any reasonable calculation of present value (at a discount rate of 5%) this would mean that at 200 aircraft produced there is still a significant loss. Allowance for a reasonable risk premium in the discount rate ups the ante. The breakeven point may be as high as 250 planes, more realistically 300.

One problem for Boeing was that the first plane would not be likely to be in service until 2008, two years after the A380.

How might you classify these risks? 6 Imagine that you are either the lead underwriter of a Lloyd's syndicate or a name backing that syndicate.

            "text": "Also important is the government or rather the governments which fix the regulations which determine the structure of supply in the airline industry over the next few decades. It does matter to the manufacturers whether in 10 years there are many small airlines or simply a few consolidated and very much larger airlines. The latter would be likely to have the resources to buy mega-liners whereas the former might not.Boeing seems keen to adopt a strategy in which it avoids direct confrontation with Airbus by putting the emphasis on a strategy which diversifies its interests. This may suggest to Airbus that Boeing is not serious about its proposals for the next generation of airliners. It is dangerously overreliant on the 737 and to a lesser extent on the 777, with the 757, 767, 717 and 747 having very few orders. Purchase of McDonnell-Douglas raised Boeing's profile in military and space, assumed to be a more stable source of revenues, one less subject to the cycles of the airliner business. In 2003 for the first time defence overtook commercial aviation as a source of revenue. Boeing is seeking to become the 'systems integrator' for high-profile defence contracts. One example is the US$16 billion contract to lease 100 new 767 airfuelling tankers to the US Air Force. Boeing's leaders have also noted the success of IBM in turning from manufacturing to supplying services. Maintenance is an obvious service which is profitable, but one which reflects the number of planes already sold. Success in providing an air traffic control system based on its satellite system would establish a significant alternative source of revenue. The financing of aircraft purchase by Boeing Capital is another area ripe for expansion, but again might be strongly linked with aircraft sales. Insofar as Boeing ceases to be dependent on aircraft sales for most of its revenue and profit, the nature of the strategic context for its rival also changes.The element of strategic risk for both companies is high. Once a decision is made to initiate a new project, and Airbus seems to be fully committed to the A380 project, then every move has to be closely planned, whether it relates to production, finance or marketing. Airbus must ensure that:\u2022 enough finance is available to see it through the deficit period and at a reasonable price \u2022 all the technical problems are fully under control \u2022 all costs fall within the planned range \u2022 all suppliers are properly prepared \u2022 every sale is won and sustained, even in recessions.The main features of the timetable of the project have little flexibility once a commitment is made.",
