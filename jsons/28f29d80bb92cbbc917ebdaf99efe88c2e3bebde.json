Airway epithelial cells of trachea or bronchi from human donors were grown on collagen coated porous filters with the apical side in contact with air and the basolateral side immersed in culture medium. Over 2 weeks, the cells polarize, develop transepithelial resistance and some become ciliated, signs of differentiation. TEM images show that these cells form a thin layer of secretions at the apical side, creating an air-liquid interface. So this pseudostratified epithelium closely mimics the in vivo situation. 9 To understand the potential role for ACE2 as the SARS-CoV receptor in the respiratory tract, we first looked for evidence of ACE2 protein expression in human lung tissue by Western blot. ACE2 was identified in lysates from human conducting airway and distal lung tissues, but this result did not indicate which cell types expressed ACE2 (data not shown). We next evaluated ACE2 protein expression in well-differentiated primary cultures of airway epithelia by immunohistochemistry. The signal for ACE2 was more abundant on the apical rather than the basolateral surface ( Figure 1A) . Furthermore, the signal intensity was strongest on ciliated cells, as demonstrated by co-localization with beta-tubulin IV, a marker of cilia, 11 suggesting that ciliated cells express ACE2 abundantly. To confirm a polar distribution of ACE2 in differentiated epithelia, selective apical or basolateral surface biotinylation with subsequent immunoprecipitation was performed ( Figure 1B) . Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins confirmed that ACE2 is expressed in greater abundance on the apical surface of conducting airway epithelia, although a weak ACE2 signal was also detected basolaterally. In contrast, ErbB2 was more abundant on the basolateral surface as previously reported, confirming selective biotinylation. 10 ",

Importantly, submersion of the apical surface of polarized cells caused loss of cilia and markedly diminished expression of ACE2 mRNA and protein (Figure 2A -C). In contrast with results in polarized epithelia, poorly differentiated primary human tracheobronchial epithelia or A549 cells grown on tissue culture plastic expressed little ACE2 mRNA or protein. Notably, foxj1, a transcription factor expressed in well-differentiated ciliated epithelia was also coordinately expressed with ACE2, indicating that ACE2 positively correlates with the state of epithelial differentiation. This raised the question of whether foxj1 might regulate ACE2 expression in airway epithelia. Primary tracheobronchial cells grown in submersion culture were transduced with an adenoviral vector expressing ACE2, a negative control \u03b2-galactosidase, or foxj1. Only transduction with the ACE2 vector conferred ACE2 expression, suggesting that foxj1 alone is not sufficient enough to regulate ACE2 expression in airway epithelia.

Only welldifferentiated epithelial cells showed significant \u03b2-galactosidase expression following transduction ( Figure 2D ). The ACE2 dependence of transduction with SARS S protein FIV pseudotyped virions, which also express \u03b2-galactosidase, was first evaluated on 293 cells with or without co-transfection with human ACE2 cDNA. The result indicated that 293 cell transduction with this vector was almost completely ACE2-dependent. To further evaluate the ACE2 dependence of human airway epithelia for SARS-CoV, we transduced poorly differentiated A549 cells and submerged primary airway epithelia that do not express constitutive ACE2 with increasing MOIs of an adenoviral vector expressing human ACE2. After 48 hr, SARS-CoV S protein pseudotyped FIV was applied to the apical surface. The results showed that there was an inoculum-dependent increase in transduction of the ACE2 complemented cells. We next applied the pseudotyped virus to the apical or basolateral surfaces of well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelia to investigate if the virus preferentially entered from one cell surface. Two days later the cells were harvested and entry evaluated by \u03b2galactosidase activity. Results indicated that the S protein pseudotyped virions transduced human airway epithelia more efficiently when applied from the apical rather than the basolateral surface. This pattern of entry correlates with ACE2 expression on polarized cells. As a control, FIV pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope entered polarized cells better from the basolateral surface.",

A549 and hTBE cells cultured under submerged conditions expressed little detectable SARS-CoV N or S gene mRNA. In contrast, in well-differentiated cells infected with SARS-CoV from the apical surface, the N and S gene mRNAs were detected at high levels. We confirmed that the gene products detected in the real time RT-PCR assays were generated from new SARS-CoV mRNA templates rather than the viral genome by verifying the appropriate size of the amplified products.

The observation that ACE2 complementation of poorly differentiated epithelia enhanced transduction with S protein pseudotyped virions in a dose-dependent manner further supports its role as a receptor. Although both DC-SIGN (CD209) and DC-SIGN (L-SIGN, CD209L) can enhance SARS-CoV infection of ACE2 expressing cells, these proteins are not sufficient to support infection in the absence of ACE2. 12, 13 Several recent reports using SARS-CoV or retroviral vectors pseudotyped with SARS S protein 14 indicated that human airway epithelial cell lines were poorly transduced, an unexpected finding that raised questions regarding the ability of respiratory epithelia to support SARS-CoV infection. The present studies help explain these findings.
