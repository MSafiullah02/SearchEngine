            "text": "Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) is a member of the family coronaviridae. It includes large single and positive stranded RNA viruses that induce a spectrum of acute and chronic diseases of the neurological, gastrointestinal and respiratory system in animals and humans, such as the human pathogens SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2011). MHV has been widely utilized as a model for viral pathogenesis, particularly the two most commonly studied strains of MHV, MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM. Infection of C57Bl/6 mice with MHV-A59 causes mild encephalitis, sub-acute demyelination, and acute hepatitis (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2007, Weiss and Leibowitz, 2011). The largely immunologically mediated demyelinating disease in mice serves as an extensively investigated model for demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2007, Das Sarma et al., 2000).",

The mature S protein is post-translationally cleaved in most MHV strains by host proteases into two 90 kDa subunits: an amino terminal subunit (S1) and a carboxy terminal subunit (S2) (Frana et al., 1985). S1\u2013S2 cleavage does not destroy virus infectivity; rather it increases the potency of coronaviruses to mediate cell\u2013cell fusion and promotes rapid virus dissemination (Frana et al., 1985, de Haan et al., 2004). S1 makes up the unique globular-head structure of the spike and contains the receptor binding activity; the S2 subunit contains two heptad repeats regions that are part of the stalk structure of the spike and are required for membrane fusion, a trans-membrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (in the cell) that is in the interior of the virus particle after budding is completed [reviewed in Heald-Sargent and Gallagher (2012)].",

            "text": "Analysis of the Fc binding activity of MHV S proteins containing either naturally occurring deletions in the S protein, neutralizing monoclonal antibody escape mutants containing S protein deletions, or recombinant S proteins, suggested that this activity most likely resided in the S1 domain (Parker et al., 1989, Taguchi and Fleming, 1989), and excluded determinants of Fc binding activity being present in the MHV S1 hyper-variable region (Oleszak et al., 1992). To investigate this further we hypothesize that regions containing specific amino acid sequences within the spike glycoprotein of MHV-A59 and other related strains that exhibited FcR binding activity would exhibit sequence similarity with the murine Fc \u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII (mFc\u03b3RII and mFc\u03b3RIII, respectively) receptors (Tamm et al., 1996), but not with the corresponding amino acids of the HCoV-OC43 S protein that did not exhibit Fc binding activity (Oleszak et al., 1995), suggesting to us several regions of interest within the spike glycoprotein as targets for mutagenesis to test this hypothesis. In this study targeted amino acid residues of S protein were replaced with alanine or with the homologous amino acids residues from the S protein of HCoV-OC43. The mutant spike glycoproteins were expressed in murine DBT cells by the vector pCAGGS-S (Niwa et al., 1991), metabolically labeled with 35S and immunoprecipitated by the neutralizing anti-S monoclonal antibodies A2.1 and A2.3 to test that they had folded correctly (Gilmore et al., 1987). Subsequently, spike genes encoding proteins with the substituted amino acids were introduced into recombinant isolates of MHV-A59 by targeted recombination (Kuo et al., 2000, Phillips et al., 2001). Several mutant viruses with interesting phenotypes were recovered. A recombinant virus containing a P939L mutation in the spike protein had a decreased ability to induce cell\u2013cell fusion. A cysteine in position 547 and the amino acids in positions 581\u2013586 within the S1 fragment of spike glycoprotein were essential for virus viability. A C547A mutation greatly decreased the reactivity with the A2.1 and A2.3 monoclonal antibodies suggesting that this cysteine was required for proper folding. Three mutants in which MHV residues were replaced by the corresponding amino acids in the HCoV-OC43 S protein, resulted in viruses that grew less well than the wild type virus. However, none of these regions was found to affect the binding of S to the anti Fc\u03b3R antibody 2.4G2, implying that the molecular mimicry property is determined not only by sequence similarity to the binding domains of Fc receptor but most probably also the unique secondary and tertiary structure of the protein as well.",

Briefly, fMHV corresponding to MHV-A59, in which the sequences encoding the spike protein ectodomain had been replaced by the corresponding feline infectious virus (FIPV) spike ectodomain coding sequence, was used as an acceptor virus. FCWF cells were infected with fMHV and incubated for 6 h. Cells were nucleofected with the transcribed donor RNAs using program T-020 and the nucleofector V kit (Lonza) and the nucleofected cells were overlaid onto a monolayer of DBT cells. The cultures were incubated up to 72 h or until cytopathic effect destroyed the monolayer. Recombinant viruses able to enter and replicate in murine cells, and those which contained the desired MHV-A59 spike ectodomain were selected by plaque assay on L2 cells. Well-separated plaques containing putative recombinant viruses were picked and underwent a second cycle of plaque purification. The twice plaque cloned viruses were expanded in murine L2 cells, and their recombinant nature was confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay on monolayers of L2 cells as previously described (Leibowitz et al., 1982).",

            "text": "An alignment of the MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM S protein amino acids sequences to the mFc\u03b3RII IgG binding domain revealed several short regions with modest sequence similarity (Fig. 1A), the most robust of which corresponded to residues 546\u2013548 in MHV-A59 (Oleszak et al., 1990). We selected this region of the MHV-A59 S protein for our initial studies and created a plasmid, designated pCAGGS-S (546\u2013548), for expressing a mutant S protein in which residues R546/C547/Q548 were changed to alanine. To determine the effect that this mutation had on the overall conformation of the protein we compared its expression and its immunoreactivity with two different conformationally sensitive anti-S monoclonal antibodies, known to neutralize MHV-A59 infectivity and block infection with virus like particles containing the MHV-A59 structural proteins (Gilmore et al., 1987, Bos et al., 1997) compared to that of wild type S protein expressed in the same vector. Replicate cultures of 293 T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-S or pCAGGS-S (546\u2013548) and after 24 h post transfection the cells were metabolically labeled with 35S (cysteine and methionine) for 9 h, harvested, cytoplasmic extracts prepared and then immunoprecipitated with the anti-spike monoclonal neutralizing antibodies A2.1 and A2.3 (Gilmore et al., 1987) or with a polyclonal rabbit anti-spike antibody, B46 (kindly provided by Dr. John Fleming and Dr. K. Holmes, respectively). As shown in Fig. 2A, the S (546\u2013548) mutant protein was barely recognized by both antibodies; signal corresponding to the complete 180 kDa protein was barely discernible compared to the robust signals obtained from the wild type glycoprotein either similarly expressed by transfection, or from cell lysates prepared from MHV-A59 infected DBT cells. Moreover, the cleaved 90 kDa S1 and S2 subunits could not be detected. In contrast the B46 polyclonal antibody strongly immunoprecipitated S (546\u2013548), making it unlikely that the weak reactivity with the A2.1 and A2.3 antibodies was due to decreased stability of the mutant protein relative to wild type S protein (Fig. 2A). Together, these results suggest that alanine substitution mutations at positions 546\u2013548 produced a major change in the conformation of the S protein. We then considered the possibility that this major change in conformation may have largely been due to our mutation of C457, a residue that could play a role in maintaining the overall conformation of the protein through a disulfide bridge. Therefore we made a second construct, containing the R546A and Q548A mutations into pCAGGS-S [pCAGGS-S (546/548)], and transfected it into cells in parallel with the parental pCAGGS-S. After radiolabeling for 9 h, starting at 24 h post transfection, lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with A2.1, A2.3, or with a polyclonal B46 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, both the 90 kDa cleaved S1/S2 subunits and the uncleaved full length 180 kDa forms of the S protein were immunoprecipatated by the two monoclonal antibodies as well as the uncleaved protein by the polyclonal B46 antibody (data not shown), suggesting that the R546A/Q548A mutations did not alter the overall conformation of the S protein and allowed it to fold properly.",

Sequences encoding the alanine replacement mutations were introduced into plasmid pMH54 by restriction fragment exchange and we subsequently performed targeted recombination to introduce these mutations into MHV-A59. A recombinant virus, designated rA59/S (554\u2013556), containing the desired S protein mutations was successfully recovered. However, unlike the previous recombinant, this virus formed plaques with a mean diameter of 1.17 \u00b1 0.18 mm whereas the plaques formed by the isogenic control virus containing the wild type S sequence had a mean diameter of 2.36 \u00b1 0.20 mm (P\n < .001). The rA59/S (554\u2013556) virus grew to titers that were equal to those achieved by control virus. Sequencing of the S gene failed to reveal any second site compensatory mutations, and this sequence and plaque phenotype was stable over three passages. Immunoprecipitation of lysates prepared from DBT cells infected with rA59/S (554\u2013556) and labeled for 1 h with [35S] methionine and cysteine from 7 to 8 h.p.i, with the A2.1 and A2.3 monoclonal antibody confirmed that this mutation did not interfere with the overall conformation of the protein. Both the non-cleaved and cleaved subunits were recognized by the monoclonal antibodies A2.1 (Fig. 3B) and A2.3 (data not shown). Similarly, immunoprecipitation with the anti-Fc\u03b3 receptor antibody 2.4G2 brought down the 180 kDa non-cleaved S protein, making it unlikely that these residues by themselves were involved in molecular mimicry of Fc\u03b3RII by S protein (Fig. 3C).",

We hypothesized that a sequence comparison searching for regions that BCoV and MHV S proteins had in common but that differed from the HCoV-OC43 S protein might identify potential sequences involved in the Fc binding activity. This bioinformatics analysis (Fig. 1B) revealed three distinct regions that included specific pairs of amino acids. These amino acid pairs were conserved within the S protein of MHV-A59 and BCoV but not in HCoV-OC43. Two of the regions were located in the S1 domain.

A second paired amino acid substitution was made by the replacement of serine in position 667 and aspartic acid in position 687 with their homologues in HCoV-OC43 (S667T and D687Y). Plasmids driving the expression of these mutant spike proteins containing these paired amino acid substitutions [pCAGGS-S (562/589) and pCAGGS-S (667/687] were transfected into 293 T cells. The transfected cells were metabolically labeled for 9 h, starting at 24 h after transfection; subsequently lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal neutralizing antibodies A2.1 and A2.3 (Fig. 5A). The non-cleaved and cleaved subunits of the S protein were precipitated by both neutralizing antibodies. However, the signal corresponding to the cleaved S1 and S2 subunits expressed by pCAGGS-S (667/687) and immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal antibodies A2.3 and A2.1 was weaker than the intensity of the signal for S1 and S2 obtained with lysates from cells transfected with wild type pCAGGS-S (Fig. 5A). This data is consistent with the S667 T and/or D687Y mutations within MHV-A59 spike protein changing the conformation and either decreasing the cleavage efficiency of the spike protein into S1 and S2 subunits or alternatively decreasing the affinity of both A2.1 and A2.3 antibodies to their binding sites in the uncleaved S protein but not the cleaved subunits. The data does not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities. Viable MHV-A59 recombinant viruses expressing each one of the paired substituted amino acids were successfully recovered and mutant S proteins immunoprecipitated from infected cell lysates by both antibodies A2.1 (data not shown) and A2.3 (Fig. 5A). The titer achieved by the virus containing the mutant rA59/S (562/589) was about 10-fold less than that achieved by wild type (isogenic control) virus and the titer achieved by rA59/S (667/687) was about 100-fold less than wild type virus (Fig. 5B). A comparison of their plaque sizes (Fig. 5B and C) was in line with the relative titers achieved by each, with the diameter of plaques formed by rA59/S (562/589) being 70% of those formed by wild type virus and plaques formed by rA59/S (667/687) being 50% the diameter of wild type plaques. Immunoprecipitation reactions of lysates prepared from rA59/S (562/589) (Supplemental Fig. S1), rA59/S (667/687) (data not shown), and isogenic control infected DBT cells with the anti-Fc\u03b3RII/RIII antibody 2.4G2 showed that these mutations did not affect the recognition of S by this antibody.",

            "text": "A third pair of amino acids that were identical in BCoV and MHV S proteins but differed in the HCoV-OC43 S protein was identified at positions 910 and 939 of the MHV-A59 spike protein, between the S1-S2 cleavage site and the first heptad repeat sequence (Fig. 1). The paired amino acids residues were located in a region highly conserved amongst the 2a lineage of betacoronaviruses and have been hypothesized to be important for the fusion of the coronavirus envelop with the plasma membrane of the host cell (Chambers et al., 1990, de Groot et al., 1987). The paired amino acids residues asparagine and proline in positions 910 and 939 of the MHV-A59 spike protein were replaced with their homologues from HCOV-OC43 (N910K and P939L, respectively). The spike protein with the paired amino acids substitutions was expressed in 293 T cells by the expression vector pCAGGS-S (910/939) and subsequently the uncleaved S protein and the cleaved subunits were precipitated by the neutralizing antibodies A2.1 (Fig. 6A, left panel) and A2.3 (not shown). The substituted amino acids did not affect binding of the N910K/P929L mutant S protein to either monoclonal antibody, nor did it affect S protein cleavage. We next replaced the wild type S sequence with the S (910/939) S sequence by targeted recombination and were successful in recovering a recombinant virus (rA59/S (910/939)) expressing the 180 kDa spike protein with the substituted amino acids and mutant S proteins immunoprecipitated from infected cell lysates with monoclonal antibody A2.3 (Fig. 6A, right panel). Both cleaved and uncleaved S protein were recognized by A2.3, congruent with the results obtained in the transient transfection experiments (Fig. 6A, left panel). A one-step growth curve experiment (Fig. 6B) revealed that the rA59/S (910/939) mutant grew with roughly similar kinetics as the wild type isogenic control virus but reached a peak titer that was depressed by approximately 1 log relative to the isogenic control strain. The effect of the mutation on plaque size was much greater, with the rA59/S (910/939) mutant virus forming significantly smaller plaques, approximately 10% the diameter of those produced by the isogenic control strain (Fig. 6C and D). Since the amino acid residue in position 939 resided in the hypothesized fusion peptide (Chambers et al., 1990), we made the working assumption that it was likely that the P939L mutation is largely responsible for the phenotype we observed in A59/S (910/939). Thus, a cDNA containing a single amino acid substitution at position 939 (P939L) was constructed and introduced into the MHV-A59 S protein by targeted recombination and a viable mutant [rA59/S (939)] was recovered. The recombinant rA59/S (939) virus grew with slightly slower kinetics than the double mutant virus, vA59/S (910/939) but ultimately reached a peak titer similar to that of the double mutant (Fig. 6B). Based on previously published data implicating this region of the S protein as containing the fusion peptide (25), we examined the ability of rA59/S (939) to induce cell fusion. Cells were infected with rA59/S (939) or the isogenic control virus and monolayers were fixed at different times post infection, nuclei were stained with DAPI and visualized by fluorescent microscopy, and photographed. The average number of nuclei contained in multinucleated giant cells per high-powered field was used as a measure of cell fusion. For cultures infected with the rA59/S (939) mutant the average number of nuclei contained in syncytia per field was decreased approximately four-fold compared to cultures infected by the wild type strain and stained at nine hours post infection (Fig. 7\n).",

Attempts to determine the reactivity of mutants of the MHV S protein with anti- mFc\u03b3RII/mFc\u03b3RIII antibody 2.4G2 in transfection experiments were problematical, largely due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient expression levels to obtain robust and reproducible immunoprecipitation reactions of S protein (wild type or mutant) expressed by pCAGG-S with this antibody (data not shown). However, the expression level obtained was sufficiently high for us to perform immunoprecipitation reactions with two conformation-dependent anti-MHV-A59 S monoclonal antibodies (Gilmore et al., 1987) to identify mutations that had major effects on S protein folding. S protein carrying the R546A/C547A/Q548A mutation [S (546\u2013548)] was poorly recognized by these conformation-dependent antibodies and the S1 and S2 cleavage products of S were not detected at all, suggesting that this mutation had a major effect on S protein folding. In contrast, S protein carrying alanine substitution mutations in R546 and Q548 but not in C547 was recognized by both of the conformation-dependent antibodies, implicating C547 as being necessary for proper folding of the S protein. This was further supported by our inability to recover a recombinant virus carrying the S (546\u2013548) mutation, whereas the S (546/548) virus was easily recovered by targeted recombination. Some strains of MHV, either viruses recovered in nature, such as MHV-A59, or selected as escape mutants from monoclonal antibody neutralization (Parker et al., 1989), contain deletions of the S protein relative to the long S proteins found in the MHV-JHM or MHV-S strains. The JHM-X strain contains the longest deletion in the S1 domain amongst these deletion variants and C547 is the first amino acid on the C-terminal side of the deletion (Taguchi and Fleming, 1989). Furthermore, an alignment of MHV and mFc\u03b3RII shows absolute conservation of this amino acid amongst all strains of MHV and its location in the secondary predicted structure (Fig. 8\n). We think it likely that C547 participates in a disulfide bridge that is important for proper folding of the S1 domain. In addition, because the deletion in JHM-X is substantial, 153 amino acids, and deletes 15 cysteine residues N-terminal of C547, we think it likely that the partner cysteine to C547 lies somewhere between C547 and the S1/S2 cleavage site at positions 717 and 718. Recovery of recombinant viruses containing the S (546/548) mutation allowed us to determine that alanine replacement of the arginine and glutamine at these two residues did not affect the ability of the S protein to be recognized by the 2.4G2 anti-mFc\u03b3RII/mFc\u03b3RIII antibody, and thus that this region of sequence similarity was unlikely to be involved in molecular mimicry of Fc\u03b3RII.",

In the case of the alanine replacement mutations at S residues 554\u2013556 we were able to recover a virus carrying these mutations by targeted recombination and test its reactivity with 2.4G2. For the alanine replacement mutations in S at residues 581\u2013586 this was not possible because we failed to recover a mutant virus by targeted recombination. These mutations altered the pattern of reactivity of mutant S protein with two conformation-dependent anti-A59 S antibodies, indicating that S protein carrying this mutation likely was not folded correctly. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the residues at 581\u2013586 are part of the epitope recognized by 2.4G2.",

Of these three mutants two, vA59/S (562/589) and vA59/S (667/687), contained mutations located in the S1 domain. Both gave rise to viable viruses, although with somewhat impaired replication, but both mutant S proteins were immunoreactive with the 2.4G2 anti-mFc\u03b3RII/mFc\u03b3RIII antibody, and thus the two regions targeted by our mutations were unlikely to be involved in molecular mimicry of Fc\u03b3RII. Our third mutant, containing N910K and P939L mutations, was located in the S2 domain. Although this double point mutation did not have alter the molecular mimicry properties of the S protein (immunoreactivity with 2.4G2 anti-mFc\u03b3RII/mFc\u03b3RIII antibody), the mutation had a marked effect on plaque size, growth kinetics, and rate of cell fusion. These effects were determined to largely reside with the P939L mutation, a residue that is 29 amino acids N-terminal to the first heptad repeat domain (968\u20131027) within the S2 fragment. The sequences between positions 929 and 944, which contain P939, have been suggested to contain the putative MHV fusion peptide (Chambers et al., 1990). This assignment is controversial in that replacement of several amino acids in the putative fusion peptide did not appear to affect the fusion properties of the S protein, though P939 was not tested in these studies (Luo and Weiss, 1998). The data in our studies is consistent with the hypothesis that P939 plays a role in the fusion properties of MHV-A59 and strengths the possibility of this region contains the fusion peptide. Alternatively, our data do not rule out the possibility that the P939L mutation either decreases the stability of the S protein or the rate of transport of S protein to the plasma membrane, and thus decreases cell fusion through of those two mechanisms. However, we think it less likely that the P939L mutation has a major effect on S protein stability because this residue is present in an equivalent position in the HCoV-OC43 S protein. HCoV-OC43 also does not induce cell\u2013cell fusion during infection.",

There are several possibilities for this result, one being that the residues involved with molecular mimicry are not linear but are brought together in space as a result of secondary and tertiary structure in S, as is the case for the Fc binding site formed by gE and gI complex in HSV (Sprague et al., 2006, Xu-Bin Murayama et al., 1989). Other potential explanations include a crucial role for residues making up the Fc binding site in the correct folding of the S protein, making it difficult to identify mutants that fold correctly and have defects in Fc binding activity.",
