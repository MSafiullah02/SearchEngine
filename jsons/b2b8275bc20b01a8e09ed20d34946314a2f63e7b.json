These emerging and periodically re-emerging epidemic diseases pose an ongoing threat to global health security. At the end of 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) Department of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases (PED) was monitoring worldwide viral outbreaks of avian influenza, coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, SARS), Ebola, Hendra, influenza (seasonal, pandemic), Nipah, Rift Valley fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers (including Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever), yellow fever, and ZikaV [2] .

ZikaV had been considered, originally a relatively mild or benign virus. However, the other related viruses have been known for several years to be associated with several severe and often fatal diseases, including central nervous system disorders, viral meningitis, encephalitis, and many other serious health outcomes. Arboviruses are often in the forefront of discussions regarding public health and their global prominence is a major public health concern. In addition to ZikaV, these viruses include dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile virus (WNV), chikungunya fever (CHIK), hemorrhagic fevers such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, since 2015, in the Americas, ZikaV evolved into a highly virulent and pathological virus for children, nearly seven decades after its discovery. ZikaV has further evolved into strains that are more virulent and lethal for adults as well [19, 20] . In fact, this process of evolving toward increased pathogenicity (pathogenization) appears to be ongoing. Globally, there is an increased association of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with ZikaV infection as well [21] [22] [23] . Figure 30 .2: A phylogenetic tree for arboviruses with ZikaV highlighted An individual infected with ZikaV will often manifest only mild symptoms or none. The most common symptoms are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. Occasionally, there can be related muscle pain or headaches. ZikaV manifests itself very much like the common flu, and consequently most people do not seek medical attention when infected. Moreover, like the flu, it can last from several days up to a few weeks. An increased association with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an uncommon disease of the nervous system, has also caused concerns. Death results rarely from ZikaV infection. Be that as it may, at the end of 2016, the most distressing effect of ZikaV infection has been for mothers during pregnancy because ZikaV was associated with a brain birth defect -microcephaly.

The physician reporting this case noted how unusual and unique the symptoms were as Kaposi's sarcoma was unknown in the patient's age group or among those of north European decent. In addition, a second unusual case was also reported. This time, the young man had been diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) -a disease that usually occurred among the very old and those living in nursing homes. These cases were puzzling and many questions arose including where the patients lived, traveled, what acute or chronic diseases they had, and with whom they interacted. It was further reported there was little in the patients' background information that indicated any major acute or chronic diseases that would suggest they would be susceptible to these illnesses [37] . Figure 30 .7: Map of HIV spread [2] The public misconceptions and misinterpretations of the HIV/AIDS epidemic did not help the scientific attack on this disease; it resulted in a limited embracing of the scientific approach by communities to solve medical issues. Early on, after this virus was discovered, immunologists speculated that HIV infection could perhaps be managed through a vaccine approach [38] . Because of further molecular research, it was ascertained that HIV underwent a high mutation rate making the development of vaccines highly difficult [24] . This fundamental molecular understanding of the mutation rate, gene structure, and evolution of HIV and the AIDS epidemic at the county, state, and national levels is still at the forefront of current concern as well.

The recent emergence of ZikaV mirrors similar delays in public health action and understanding that initially accelerated the spread of HIV/AIDS globally. Without a comprehensive and collaborative approach, ZikaV will have a similar damaging effect, globally, as the HIV/AIDS epidemic has had during the past decades. The ZikaV pandemic reinforced that there is global human domination, urban crowding, expanded international travel, disruption of environmental equilibria, and other human behaviors combined with human-caused perturbations in ecologic balance that have promoted several latent infectious agents to emerge so unexpectedly [19, 44] . It is urgent to approach this epidemic through a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach to minimize the spread of the ZikaV [44] .
