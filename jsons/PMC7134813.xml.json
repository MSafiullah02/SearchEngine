This paper describes from an insider perspective Toronto 2-1-1's response to an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to the Great Northeastern Blackout. Five lessons learned from these experiences are discussed, and subsequent changes in Toronto 2-1-1's role in the community and functions in emergency response situations are described.",

Another 300 people, about one third of them healthcare workers, were reported to have been infected.1 SARS appeared in a few locations in North America in early March, and began to spread in Toronto. On March 14, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care alerted healthcare providers about four cases resulting in two deaths within a single family in Toronto.2 As other cases surfaced, fear spread across the city, especially in Toronto's many Asian communities where travel to China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong was frequent.3 Incomplete, rapidly changing, and sometimes conflicting public information about SARS compounded this fear.",

            "text": "The 2011 Goderich, Ontario, tornado that left one person dead and caused more than $75 million in damages demonstrated how a well-integrated 2-1-1 phone, social media, and Internet service can become the focal point for emergency information. The 2-1-1 system's in-the-moment crisis information included updates on Red Cross needs, donation needs and drop-off sites, gathering centers, alternative shelters, and aggregated information about the latest availability and location of services that often can change from hour to hour during crises. The Ontario 2-1-1 system shares an aggregated, unified, and constantly updated database that all 2-1-1 operators as well as the public can access on the Internet. Updated information on emergent or ephemeral situations such as regional forest fires or local flood-service response is shared among the operators, particularly with Toronto 2-1-1, which provides after-hours service. Toronto 2-1-1 also has partnered with Toronto Public Health to disseminate timely citywide heat alerts during the summer's hottest days and shares data with Toronto Social Development to analyze and better understand social and community needs and resources.",

            "text": "Multiple steps have been taken to strengthen Toronto 2-1-1's infrastructure and capacity to respond to future crises in Ontario. In 2010\u20132011, funding was secured to purchase and install a rooftop gas-powered generator linked to the gas utility at Toronto 2-1-1. To bridge the time gap between power failure and generator start-up, battery back-up for critical equipment also was purchased and installed. In 2012, a joint Business Continuity Plan is being developed that will enable 2-1-1s in the province to back each other up as well as support processes in the event of an emergency. A similar cooperative relationship is already in place, with Toronto 2-1-1 providing after-hours bilingual (English and French) information and referral for six other 2-1-1s across the province.",

It also illustrates how 2-1-1s can adapt on the fly to unique circumstances of unexpected events, and quickly establish community partnerships to address emerging issues. Finally, learning from these experiences to improve future service is critical. It is a hope that sharing this information with other 2-1-1 systems and the communities they serve will generate more useful ideas and practical solutions for the times ahead when facing similar events.",
