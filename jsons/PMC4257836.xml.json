Substitution rates were consistent across each gene for PPRV. However, greater substitution rates were observed in the GC rich regions of the F and M genes. Similarly, the substitution rate was greater, as predicted because of the variability seen at the nucleotide level, in the highly variable region of the N gene sequence (255 nt) for PPRV.

Our phylogeographic analysis indicated that Nigeria was the geographic origin of the most recent common ancestor of PPRV because of the highest root location state probability. Furthermore, geographic origins of the most recent common ancestor of PPRV lineages I, II, and III were predicted to be across Africa; lineage IV likely emerged in India. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the origin of PPRV was in western Africa, which then spread to eastern Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. However, although these predictions are suggestive of a potential origin for PPRV, caution must be exercised in their interpretation because estimates of geographic origin rely on available datasets, and these datasets need enhancing to provide greater confidence for phylogenetic assessment.
