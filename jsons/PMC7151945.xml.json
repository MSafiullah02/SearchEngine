In contrast, among the 89 infants who did not meet these criteria, 22 (25%) had a serious bacterial infection (P < 0.0001) and 9 (10%) had bacteremia (P < 0.0005).",

Some clinicians adhere to a protocol of treating all young infants with fever and no apparent focus of infection with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents administered intravenously in the hospital until the results of cultures of the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are known.62 Although perceived as the safe approach, it incurs considerable financial cost and risk of iatrogenic complications and of diagnostic misadventures associated with hospitalization.63, 64, 65 These risks include errors in the type and dosage of drugs, complications of venous cannulation (e.g., phlebitis, sloughing of the skin), and nosocomial infections. Hospitalization of a young infant is a major disruption for the family and may potentiate development of the vulnerable child syndrome.66\n",

If a decision is made to administer antimicrobial agents intravenously, ampicillin (100 to 200 mg/kg per day every 6 hours) plus gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg per day every 8 hours) or a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg per day in one dose; cefotaxime, 150 mg/kg per day every 8 hours) could be chosen. Ampicillin and gentamicin is a well-established combination with narrower spectrum of antimicrobial activity than ceftriaxone and excellent effectiveness against group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, and many enteric gram-negative rods. Because of the rising incidence of ampicillin-resistant E. coli and the rarity of listeriosis in recent large studies, a regimen with a third-generation cephalosporin without ampicillin offers coverage for the few infants who have bacteremia or meningitis with a UTI due to ampicillin-resistant E. coli.11, 12, 25 No study has directly assessed the relative risks and benefits of either regimen. Before initiating antimicrobial treatment with any regimen, cultures of the blood, urine (obtained by urethral catheterization or suprapubic aspiration of the bladder), and CSF should be obtained.",
