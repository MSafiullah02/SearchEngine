Lasswell (1956a) envisioned the policy sciences as providing insights into such situations, challenging and informing ongoing processes and decisions, and foretelling of future scenarios, all with the intent of steering government and society toward greater human dignity for all. Since the formulation of this vision over seven decades ago, the policy sciences have evolved into a vibrant field of scholarship, marked by conceptual richness, theoretical diversity, and methodological pluralism (Cairney and Weible 2017; Torgerson 2017). This commentary capitalizes on the diversity and follows in the footsteps of Lasswell\u2019s vision by responding to the following question: What insights do the policy sciences offer to help us understand the COVID-19 pandemic?",

Most countries have closed or restricted their borders and restricted travel within borders. One-third of the world\u2019s population has been subjected to some social restrictions (from school closures to stay-at-home orders). These policy decisions exist across levels of government. For example, some occur at the national level, such as the world\u2019s largest lock down targeting India\u2019s 1.3 billion people, or at the subnational or local level, such as California\u2019s state-law to prohibit evicting tenants of commercial property.1 In examining this surge of policy change through the lens of the literature on policymaking, a few lessons emerge.",

Policy decisions are further conditioned by contextual factors, including institutional (e.g., constitutional and legalistic structures) factors, cultural orientations, economies, and political styles (among others). For example, Sweden\u2019s response to COVID-19 has thus far avoided many of the lockdowns of other countries, a response that has been partially attributed to a culture of trust and responsibility. Finally, prompting all of these changes is the shock of COVID-19 itself, which directly affects healthcare systems worldwide, but indirectly affects other policy areas, for example, by postponing welfare reforms, environmental policies, and other actions deemed \u201cnon-essential\u201d.2",

For the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the choices has been between mitigating versus suppressing COVID-19. Such choices impose different social and economic costs and benefits and raise important questions about how we value those costs and benefits. Given heightened public attention and policy impacts across society, most policy decisions (and non-decisions) are heavily scrutinized and politicized through framing contests and blame-games (Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m and Kuipers 2003). Examples include debates around the Swedish strategy to ensure a slow spread of the virus (Henley 2020) and conflict in Brazil between state governors and the president over the best approach to tame the epidemic (Reuters 2020). Other governments, such as New Zealand (Roy 2020), Ireland (Power et al. 2020), and Iran (Karimi and Batrawy 2020), have been publicly criticized for doing too little too late. These experiences challenge the notion that policy conflicts can be temporarily suspended in times of crisis, with political opponents rallying around the proverbial flag until the worst is over. Indeed, there is a strong possibility that, while some policy conflicts will wane, others will wax as opportunities for political gain manifest and divisions emerge between those who support or oppose a government\u2019s response.",

International collaboration flourished in response to COVID-19, channeled through the epistemic community of epidemiologists, virologists, and pharmacologists. Such collaboration is enabled by a global network of state agencies, private interests, and international institutions in efforts to coordinate public information activities and global research priorities (Mesfin 2020). In this transboundary crisis, countries exchange data and experiences to learn about the virus and its effects. High-level officials meet regularly to discuss travel bans, trade, and undertake joint actions to dampen economic impacts (Khan 2020). Meanwhile, many potential pitfalls plague the pursuit of such collaboration. Ample examples illustrate of how communication failures, political values and identities, and weak mandates can undermine efforts to achieve a collective crisis response (Boin and 't Hart 2010).",

While Johnson speaks about \u201ceach of us\u201d, he places this pronoun in the context of a \u201chuge national effort\u201d, enabling him to urge \u201cthe people of this country to rise to that challenge and\u2026to come through\u2026stronger than ever\u2026as many times in the past\u201d. Through the reference to the past, he appeals to emotions of patriotism and national pride. The latter helps interpret one of Donald Trump\u2019s framings of the pandemic as\u201dforeign\u201d and its spread as \u201ccases entering our shores\u201d (Kessler and Rizzo 2020).5 Trump strengthens this frame through the extensive use of military vocabulary, as when he described the virus is something to be \u201cdefeated\u201d. Iranian Prime minister Ali Khamenei uses a similar framing by claiming the virus \u201ccomes from the US\u201d and could even be \u201cmanipulated\u201d by them. This framing helps to legitimize the Iranian Government\u2019s limited ability to deal with the pandemic, as it links emotions of anxiety around COVID-19 to the anxiety around major geopolitical conflict.6",

Many of our policy choices reflect a \u201cmuscle memory\u201d from the past to guide us through the crisis until we can pause and reflect, allowing for deeper forms of learning. With COVID-19, we have some experiences to draw on, as illustrated in the USA ensuring oversight in the relief bill, building in part from perceptions of what the 2008 stimulus package lacked (Woodruff 2020). However, the novelty of COVID-19 may also prevent learning opportunities from the past to guide us (Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m et al. 2004). At the same time, in the face of a crisis we may be even more inclined to look to those who are most like us, politically and ideologically, for lessons.

Adapting Bovens and 't Hart (1998) useful approach to COVID-19 is the assessment of the extent of success/failure, its causes (from mismanagement to inevitability) and implications for future crisis decisions (from refining existing directions to the need for dramatic change). This can be applied to the \u201cwhole of government\u201d response or simply to one aspect of the responses. Multiple narratives and variations are possible, but we outline three hypothetical illustrations:First is the success trajectory e.g., a reduction in the number of daily cases is the product of the early banning of international flights from China. Our successes were and will continue to be the result of pre-emptive action.Second is the failure trajectory e.g., the current exponential rise in confirmed cases is the product of complacent political leadership, more interested in calming fears for the next election than in addressing very real threats. New thinking is needed to avert more unnecessary tests.Third is the mixed trajectory e.g., the government has succeeded in slowing down the rate of new infections but hospitals still cannot cope. We cannot afford to be complacent and must channel additional funds into front-line healthcare.",
