Three lung cancer cell lines including human adenocarcinoma SK-LU-1 and A549 cells andnon-small cell lungcancer SK-MES-1 cells were incubated with Ang-(1-7) to determine the effect of the heptapeptide on cell growth [12]. Ang-(1-7) potently inhibited the growth of all cell lines of lung cancer at subnanomolar concentrations [12]. The antiproliferative effect of Ang-(1-7) was associated with reduction in serum-stimulated phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 [12]. In addition, the inhibitory effect of Ang-(1-7) was mediated by Mas receptor, since it was blocked by the Mas receptor antagonist D-Ala7-Ang-(1-7) (A-779) and not affected by AT1 or AT2 [12]. In vivo evidence was obtained by the intravenous administration of Ang-(1-7) in mice with A549 human lung tumors [15]. Ang-(1-7) infusion was very well tolerated by the mice andresulted in a reduction of tumor volume by 30% compared to the size prior to treatment [15]. These findings were associated with a decrease in the proliferation marker Ki67 [15].",

            "text": "Two other mechanisms that may contribute to antitumor effect of Ang-(1-7) in lung cancer arecyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibition and antiangiogenic activity. COX-2is overexpressed in 70\u201390% of adenocarcinomas [16]. Clinical trials with nonselective inhibitors of COX-2 decreased the risk for lung cancer, suggesting that a reduction in COX-2 is associated with inhibition of lung tumor growth [17, 18]. Ang-(1-7) significantly reduced COX-2 mRNA and protein in both A549 tumor xenografts and A549 cells in culture [15]. It should be pointed that Ang-(1-7) has significant advantages over the administration of nonselective and selective COX-2 inhibitors for lung cancer since the heptapeptide-mediated reduction in COX-2 is associated with antithrombotic and antiinflammatory activities without the side effects related to COX-2 inhibitors [19]. In regard to antiangiogenic activity, athymic mice with A549 lung tumors were injected daily with 1000 \u03bcg/kg of Ang-(1-7) for 5 days, followed by a 2-day drug-free, and sacrificed after 42 days [20]. Ang-(1-7) markedly decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein and mRNA, vessel density and A549 lung tumor growth [20]. The antiangiogenic effect of Ang-(1-7) was also mediated by Mas receptor [20].",

Another recent line of investigation is the use viral vectors to deliver Ang-(1-7). Chen and coworkers [23] constructed a mutant adeno-associated viral vector AAV8 (Y733F) that produced stable and highly efficient Ang-(1-7)expression in a xenograft tumor model. AAV8-mediated Ang-(1-7) overexpression inhibited tumor growth in vivo by downregulating Cdc6 and antiangiogenesis.

It has been previously reported that PODX enhances invasion in many human cancers including GBM. The authors found a significant negative correlation between the expression of PODX and Mas in GBM tumor tissues from 10 patients (r = \u22120.768, p < 0.01) [35]. The stable overexpression of PODX in LN-229 and U-118 MG human GBM cells decreased the mRNA and protein expression of Mas receptor, resulting in low density of Ang-(1-7)-binding Mas on the cell membrane. Overexpression and knockdown of PODX respectively reversed and enhanced the inhibitory effects of Ang-(1-7) on the expression/activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cell invasion and proliferation in GBM cells. PODX inhibited Ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling by downregulating the expression of Mas through a PI3K-dependent mechanism in GBM cells. This effect increased GBM cell invasion and proliferation [35].",

The two cell lines expressed Ang-(1-7)-generating peptidases, including ACE2, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and prolyl-endopeptidase together with Mas receptor. IL-1\u03b2 stimulated mRNA and protein expression for Mas receptor, which was associated with a reduction of proliferation and migration. On the other hand, RNA-mediated knockdown of Mas expression led to increased cell proliferation, supporting a beneficial role of ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas receptor axis in the treatment of osteosarcoma [37].",

            "text": "The treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has been associated with several side effects [38]. Therefore, the investigation on novel treatment modalities for NPC is of utmost importance. It was found that Mas receptor in significantly upregulated in NPC specimens and NPC cell lines [39]. Viral vector-mediated expression of Ang-(1-7) markedly inhibited NPC cell proliferation and migration in vitro. These effects were mediated by Mas receptor since they were completely blocked by A-779 [39]. In addition, Ang-(1-7) significantly reduced the growth and the vessel density of human nasopharyngeal xenografts [39]. Mechanistic investigations revealed that, also in this tumor, Ang-(1-7) inhibited the expression of the proangiogenic factors VEGF and PlGF. The effects and signaling pathways involved in the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis in NPC were further investigated both in vitro and in vivo [40]. Ang-(1-7) inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC-TW01 cells. Ang-(1-7) induced autophagy by increasing the levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II and by enhancing p62 degradation via activation of the Beclin-1/Bcl-2signaling pathway with participation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p38 pathways [40]. Pretreatment with Ang-(1-7) also inhibited tumor growth in NPC xenografts by stimulating autophagy, while no autophagy was observed following Ang-(1-7) posttreatment [40]. To sum up, Ang-(1-7) plays a role in autophagy downstream signaling pathways in NPC, supporting its therapeutic potential for reducing the incidence of primary NPC tumors and for preventing recurrent disease [40].",

Cancer-induced bone pain is often severe due to accentuated inflammation, rapid bone degradation, and disease progression [44].

The antinociceptive effect of Ang-(1-7) was investigated in a murine model of breast cancer-induced bone pain. Breast cancer cells were implanted into the femur of BALB/c mice [42]. Spontaneous and evoked pain behaviors were examined before and after acute and chronic administration of Ang-(1-7). Cancer inoculation increased spontaneous pain behaviors by day 7. Both single injection and sustained administration of Ang-(1-7) significantly reduced pain. Preadministration of A-779 impeded this reduction, while pretreatment with an AT2 receptor antagonist had no effect. However, the use of an AT1 antagonist potentiated the antinociceptive effect of Ang-(1-7). Ang-(1-7) via Mas receptor activation significantly attenuated pain without the side effects seen with opioids [42].",
