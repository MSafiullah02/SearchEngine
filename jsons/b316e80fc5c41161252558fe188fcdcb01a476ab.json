In other words, for every symptomatic patient confirmed, 6482 asymptomatic cases are assumed to exist.An earlier study [9] revealed the proportion of asymptomatic cases among infected people as 3/23. That proportion represents a huge difference from our results presented herein. A possible reason might be laboratory test procedures. Earlier studies used PCR tests that detected infection at the time of specimen collection. Therefore, a negative PCR test result does not contradict a past infection. To confirm our results through laboratory testing, complete laboratory-based surveillance using an IgG antibody test, not PCR, in the community is expected to be necessary.Such a trail had started in New York City and found that about 15% of residents were positive by the antibody testing [10]. At that time, In New York State, the prevalence was reported as 0.88%. Therefore, q was 94% in New York state. It may be similar with our results of q.",
