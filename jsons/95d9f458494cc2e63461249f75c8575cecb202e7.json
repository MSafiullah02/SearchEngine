Summary: A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community. This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas ho-mology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures.",

As soon as on January 7, 2020, the Chinese health authorities had declared that a novel coronavirus was responsible for this outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, a European network of academic and public laboratories designed an rRT-PCR protocol based on the comparison and alignment of previously available SARS-CoV and bat-related coronavirus genome sequences as well as five sequences derived from the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 made available by the Chinese authorities [23] . Three assays were developed. The first-line assay targets the E gene encoding for the envelope protein, which is common to the Sarbecovirus subgenus, while the second specific assay targets the RdRp gene encoding for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This assay contains two probes: one probe, which reacts with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene, and a second probe (RdRP_SARSr-P2) which is specific to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the third additional confirmatory assay targets the nucleocapsid (N) gene. This last assay was not further validated because it is slightly less sensitive [23] . This protocol was adopted in more than 30 European laboratories [24] . Recently, a novel rRT-PCR assay targeting a different region of the RdRp/Hel gene of SARS-CoV-2 has been developed that showed a higher sensitivity and specificity than the RdRp-P2 assay [25] .",

Different coronaviruses use different domains within the S1 subunit to enter the cell. These domains are named S A and S B . SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via domain S B to enter target cells [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . It has recently been shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds the ACE2 receptor via the S B domain similarly to SARS-CoV, and that murine polyclonal antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell mediated by S.

This analysis should find which are probably the most common sites undergoing an amino acid change, providing insight into some important proteins of COVID-19 that are involved in the mechanism of viral entry and viral replication. These data should contribute to improving our understanding of how this virus acts in its pathogenicity. Furthermore, to identify a potential molecular target is fundamental to follow the molecular evolution of the virus, which can suggest some interesting sites for a potential therapy or vaccine. The structural similarity of the region in which the positive selective pressure occurs, and the stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein, should be probable reasons why this virus is more contagious than SARS. Instead, the destabilizing mutation located near the phosphatase domain of the nsp3 protein may explain why viral replication is slower than in SARS with a longer incubation period. Anyway, further studies are needed on this aspect [39] .",

In this case, knowledge of the virus's protein structure would greatly enhance the possibility of understanding the biological meaning of the observed muta-tions. Now, only the X-ray structure of COVID-19 nsp5 protease (PBD code 6LU7) is available, although it is expected that many other structures will become available soon. In the meantime, homology modeling could provide preliminary structural clues. Homology modeling needs structural templates sharing sufficient sequence similarity to the targets. In Figure 1 and Table 1 , a list of potential templates for homology modeling of the proteins coded by the COVID-19 genome is displayed. The structures with the largest coverage and the greatest sequence identity have been incorporated into Figure 1 and Table 1 . According to this list, it is evident that most of the viral proteins are at modeling distance from PDB structures. This information should be exploited as soon as possible. ",
