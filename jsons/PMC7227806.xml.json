The airflow in the operating room was reversed to provide a negative pressure environment, and in addition to the N95 masks and eye protection already worn by operating room personnel, isolation gowns and face shields were donned. Before conclusion of the surgery, the sample was confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction assay. After the surgery was completed, surgical and ancillary operating room staff left the operating room to limit possible exposure during extubation. The patient was weaned from the ventilator as she emerged from anesthesia. Blood-tinged, frothy secretions from the ETT required repeat suctioning, but she maintained adequate oxygenation on 100% Fio2 with spontaneous ventilation. Before extubation, the previously utilized air-cushioned facemask was placed over the ETT to limit spread of secretions (Figure 2). To prevent the patient from coughing on emergence, the lidocaine infusion was continued. After extubation, the mask was strapped onto the patient to create a tight seal, and the ventilator circuit delivered supplemental oxygen while the patient spontaneously breathed. The patient recovered in the operating room with only the anesthesiologists in attendance. Oxygen was weaned as tolerated to maintain Spo2 >90%. Attempts at breathing room air resulted in desaturations to 80%\u201385%. However, the patient maintained Spo2 >90% on 2 L oxygen and appeared comfortable without coughing. On repeat questioning, she acknowledged that she resided with approximately 60 individuals in 1 room of the shelter and newly reported that \u201cmany appeared to be ill.\u201d She was transferred to an inpatient COVID-19 floor with a surgical mask overlying a nasal cannula providing 2 L/min of oxygen. Throughout the following 6 days as an inpatient, her oxygen requirements decreased. She reported dyspnea on exertion and had nocturnal oxygen desaturations, but her Spo2 remained >88% on room air. Her nocturnal oxygen desaturations were attributed to likely undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.",

Once suspicion of COVID-19 arose, the operating room staff were informed and asked to don additional personal protective equipment (PPE), such as isolation gowns and face shields. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed expeditiously, and the operating room was transitioned to negative pressure. In spite of copious blood-tinged, frothy secretions, suctioning was minimized to limit viral aerosolization. Because of increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from viral aerosolization during airway manipulation,7 on completion of the surgery and before extubation, operating room staff, other than the anesthesiologists, were asked to leave. The patient recovered in the operating room and transferred wearing a surgical mask over a nasal cannula8 directly to her inpatient room in a designated COVID-19 unit.",
