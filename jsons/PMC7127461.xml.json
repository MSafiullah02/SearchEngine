            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome comprising acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, with a mortality rate of 40% and a cure rate of only 34% (Rubenfeld et al., 2005). This life-threatening disease can result from severe infections, shock, trauma, or burns (Tsai et al., 2015). Neutrophils are major inflammation mediators involved in the pathogenesis of various lung inflammatory diseases including ALI (Stevens et al., 2011). Neutrophilic inflammation has attracted considerable attention because of the influenza caused by the influenza A H1N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses (Yokoyama et al., 2010). Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is a 30 kDa serine protease stored in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils. When inflammation occurs, HNE released from neutrophils and bound mainly to the neutrophil plasma membrane facilitates neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by degrading various host proteins, such as extracellular matrix proteins (Siedle et al., 2007). Under normal physiological conditions, HNE is controlled by its endogenous inhibitors (Fitch et al., 2006, Pham, 2006, Rubin, 1996, Williams et al., 2006). However, large amounts of oxygen radicals and proteases released by leukocytes recruited to inflammation sites can inactivate these endogenous inhibitors (Clark et al., 1981). Environmental factors, including cigarette smoke and air pollution, and genetic factors can disrupt the protease-antiprotease balance (Brebner and Stockley, 2013, Cavarra et al., 2001, Gooptu and Lomas, 2009). Excess extracellular HNE can stimulate inflammatory lung disorders because of its involvement in inflammation, mucus overproduction, and lung tissue damage (Bergin et al., 2008, Caldwell et al., 2005, Wright et al., 2002).",

            "text": "Sivelestat sodium hydrate (ONO-5046) is the only clinically registered chemically synthesized HNE inhibitor approved for use in humans. It attenuates pulmonary disorders, improves pulmonary function, and is clinically used to treat pneumonia and ALI caused by viral infections (Yokoyama et al., 2010). However, ONO-5046 use is limited by its poor pharmacokinetics and the potential risk of organ toxicity because it irreversibly inhibits HNE by covalently binding to Ser-195 (Huang et al., 2008, Ohbayashi, 2002, Stevens et al., 2011). Research on synthetic HNE inhibitors has focused on nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, among which AZD9668 has superior HNE selectivity to ONO-5046, with an IC50 value of 44 nM (Stevens et al., 2011). Compounds of the BAY series also inhibit HNE activity, with the IC50 value for the HNE inhibitory (HNEI) effect of BAY-678 at the picomolar level after structural modification. BAY-85\u20138501 was also effective in an ALI model in rodents (von Nussbaum et al., 2015). Moreover, natural terpenoids have been reported to possess an HNEI effect (Kim et al., 2015, Lee et al., 2015). In another study, we found that pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs) protect against inflammation-induced lung injury by reversibly and competitively inhibiting HNE activity. Among these PTs, ursolic acid (UA) exhibited the highest inhibitory potency (IC50 = 5.51 \u03bcM) (Feng et al., 2013). However, its limited solubility and poor bioavailability hinder its practical use as a clinical drug (Liu, 2005).",

Evidence exists that crude plant extracts often have greater in vitro or in vivo activity than isolated constituents of the equivalent dosage (Rasoanaivo et al., 2011). We wanted to determine whether UA in a plant extract would have a better HNEI effect than purified UA and therefore chose Eriobotrya japonica (loquat leaves, LLs) as the objective material. In China and Japan, LLs have long been used as herbal medicine to treat chronic bronchitis and coughs (Cha et al., 2011). Studies have indicated many health-related benefits of LLs, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Liu et al., 2016, Maher et al., 2015). LLs are also known to be abundant in PTs, including UA (Li et al., 2015). Therefore, this study elucidated the HNEI effect of the triterpenoid composition of loquat leaves (TCLL) compared with purified UA in vitro and in vivo.",

When a solid dispersion of total PTs in LLs containing euscaphic acid, maslinic acid, corosolic acid, oleanolic acid, and UA was co-administered with the P-gp inhibitor verapamil in a rat model, the relative bioavailability of these PTs increased (Cai, 2013).
