Researchers at the University of Kentucky and their colleagues identified a source of age-related inflammation that, if targeted by appropriate medications, holds great promise for promoting healthy aging. They manipulated immune cells from 30-year-old people to mimic inflammation in cells from 60-year-old people. This method identified specific breakdowns in the cellular machinery that cause age-related inflammation. The type 2 diabetes drug metformin repaired the broken machinery in cells treated outside the body to drastically lower inflammation, paving the way for clinical trials to test whether metformin lowers age-related inflammation to promote healthy aging.\n",

Aging-associated inflammation has been defined based on cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 (Bruunsgaard et al., 2000, Roubenoff et al., 1998, Ferrucci et al., 2005, Piber et al., 2019), without consideration of the relative importance of the many sources of what is collectively labeled \u201cinflammation.\u201d T cells are a major source of inflammatory cytokines in settings characterized by chronic low-level inflammation, and multiple lines of evidence showed that one particular T cell subset, Th17s, characterizes and mathematically predicts T2D (Ip et al., 2016). Th17s also promote arguably the most prevelant inflammatory disease in the world, periodontal disease, which fuels cardiovascular and other more deadly diseases (Abusleme and Moutsopoulos, 2017). Similarly defining age-associated T cell inflammation will significantly enhance our current appreciation of inflammaging toward the goal of improving health span.",

Autophagy has multiple immunomodulatory effects, including broad coordination of general immune cell responses, as evidenced by the importance of autophagy in development and function of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Wei et al., 2016, Le Texier et al., 2016). Autophagy controls immune cell function in part by regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, as shown by demonstrations that CD4+ T cell autophagy negatively regulates glucose metabolism in Tregs (Kabat et al., 2016). Given that ATP generation through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) versus non-mitochondrial glycolysis (deemed \u201cglycolysis\u201d herein) can determine T cell function (Kominsky et al., 2010, Priyadharshini et al., 2018), these findings suggest that autophagy enhancement may alter the mitochondrial response of T cells to stimulation, and thereby ameliorate inflammaging to prolong health span. Arguably, the top candidate drug for activating autophagy over the immediate term is metformin, a well-tolerated T2D drug that improves glycemic control and, in some studies, chronic inflammation (Cameron et al., 2016, Mal\u00ednsk\u00e1 et al., 2016). Putative effects of metformin on age-associated T cell inflammation justify targeted pre-clinical work to identify metformin-sensitive mechanisms that ameliorate a more sophisticated profile of inflammaging.",

Metformin increased autophagy in CD4+ T cells from older subjects and shifted measures of mitochondrial bioenergetics and T cell inflammation to values indistinguishable from young subjects\u2019 cells. siRNA-mediated impairment of autophagy, but not mitophagy, in cells from younger subjects compromised mitochondrial function and activated a Th17 profile indistinguishable from T cell profiles produced by cells from older subjects. We conclude metformin-sensitive defects in immune cell autophagy (1) accompany natural aging in people, (2) shift mitochondrial bioenergetics, and (3) fuel a previously unappreciated Th17 inflammaging profile. Our findings highlight cause-and-effect relationships among defects in non-mitochondrial autophagy, mitochondrial function, and inflammaging to justify clinical trials to extend health span with metformin.",

O cells produced higher amounts of most classically defined Th17-associated/supportive cytokines (IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-23) but similar amounts of cytokines typically produced by other CD4+ T cell subsets (Figures 1A and S1A\u2013S1D). Age-associated shifts in CD4+ T cell subset distribution in our cohort was as previously published (Figures 1B and S1E), including CD57+ terminal effectors that were almost unique to samples from O subjects and fewer central memory T cells in Y samples. These results were consistent with recent work showing that Th17 frequency does not increase with age (Alpert et al., 2019). Age-associated changes in CD8+ T cell subsets were also as expected (Figure S1F). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) models, which combine all cytokines from one sample into a compendium multi-dimensional value for \u201cinflammation,\u201d showed that cytokine production differentiates O and Y samples (Figure 1C). Variable importance projection (VIP) calculations, which rank cytokines based on their overall importance for separating cytokine data clouds, showed almost all Th17 cytokines were disproportionately important for identifying higher overall inflammation produced by O-derived CD4+ T cells (VIP > 1.0, bracket in Figure 1D, red bars highlight classical Th17 cytokines). We conclude that a comprehensive Th17 profile defines and mathematically predicts age-related T cell inflammation.",

Metformin specifically decreased production of Th17 cytokines but failed to decrease most Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) by O cells (O + met), as indicated by single cytokine (Figures 1A and S1A\u2013S1D) or PLSDA (Figures 1E and 1F) analysis. In contrast, single cytokine analyses showed metformin did not change cytokine production by Y-derived T cells (Y + met; Figures 1A and S1A\u2013S1D), while PLSDA showed metformin ameliorated a Th2/type 2 immune profile produced by Y cells (IL-13, IL-33, IL-31, IL-10, and IL-5; Figures 1G and 1H).

Spare respiratory capacity was similar between O and Y cells. CD4+ T cells from O compared Y subjects produced less lactate and had lower ECAR (Figures 2A\u20132D and S2A\u2013S2D). Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was lower in O cells, as measured by tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) (Figure 2E), perhaps in part due to intrinsically lower membrane potential differences in O compared with Y cells (Figure 2F). Addition of metformin (100 \u03bcM) concomitant with stimulation decreased basal and maximal OCR, OCR:ECAR ratio, and proton leak of CD4+ T cells from O subjects (Figures 2A, 2B, 2D, S2A, and S2B). Metformin increased lactate production and ECAR (Figures 2C and S2C) and supported a trend toward increase in MMP in CD4+ T cells from O subjects (Figure 2E; p = 0.055). Metformin action on mitochondrial bioenergetics was independent of AMPK, as indicated by similar outcomes from cells treated with AMPK-specific or scrambled siRNA prior to stimulation and extracellular flux (XF) analysis (Figures S2E and S2F). Metformin had no effect on the mitochondrial function of T cells from Y subjects (Figures 2A\u20132E and S2A\u2013S2D). We conclude that higher OXPHOS corresponds with lower glycolysis and Th17 inflammation in T cells from O compared with Y subjects, and that metformin shifts O cells to recapitulate characteristics of Y cells.",

To begin testing this possibility, we quantified protein levels of glycolytic pathway enzymes. CD4+ T cells from O subjects had lower expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH), which catalyzes pyruvate \u2194 lactate (Figure 2G), providing a mechanistic explanation for low lactate in O cells (Figure 2C). Expression of enzymes that regulate pyruvate production from glucose, including hexokinase and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), was higher or equivalent, respectively, in CD4+ T cells from O compared with Y subjects (Figures S2G and S2H), suggesting age did not change pyruvate production to limit lactate. In contrast to lower glycolysis, pyruvate hydrolysis through the citric acid cycle was not likely compromised by age-dependent changes in citric acid cycle enzymes, as suggested by protein levels of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) (Figures S2I and S2J). NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (mitochondrial respiratory complex 1) was quantitatively equal in CD4+ T cells from O and Y subjects, although western blots suggested an age-related post-translational modification (Figure S2K). Metformin increased protein levels of LDH (Figure 2G) and OGDH (Figure S2J) in CD4+ T cells from O subjects but had no effect on the other enzymes measured. We conclude age-related decreases in LDH, which are sensitive to metformin, mechanistically explain lower glycolysis and may thereby promote compensatory OXPHOS in CD4+ T cells from O subjects.",

CD4+ T cells from O subjects had more ROS than Y counterparts, as measured by DCFDA (Figure 3\nA), and consistent with higher ATP-linked respiration (Figure 3B). Lower glutathione (GSH) and more nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) in O compared with Y cells indicated that less antioxidant, perhaps in response to \u201creverse\u201d NNT function (Nickel et al., 2015), contributed to higher oxidative stress (Figures 3C and 3D).

Tempol reduced ROS and trended toward increased MMP (TMRE, p = 0.058) in CD4+ T cells from O subjects (Figures 3F and 3G), but perhaps more importantly, Tempol uniformly decreased Th17 profile cytokines in O cells with no effect on Y cells, though effects on other cytokines somewhat differed from effects of metformin (Figures 3H and S3C\u2013S3F). Tempol and metformin together increased TMRE signal more than either alone in O cells (Figure 3F), further indicating overlapping but non-identical effects of ROS scavenging and metformin, but consistent with previous demonstrations that ROS dissipation is a mechanism of metformin action (Madiraju et al., 2019). We conclude mitochondrial OXPHOS in O cells coincides with lower antioxidant to cause oxidative stress and a ROS-downstream Th17 profile. Metformin-sensitive pathways that are partially redundant with mitochondrial ROS-scavenging re-establish redox balance to ameliorate T cell inflammaging.",

O cells had less robust autophagy than Y counterparts, as shown by lower LC3II, p62 accumulation, and fewer LC3II-labeled puncta. Metformin improved all measures of autophagy in O cells (Figures 4E\u20134H). More LC3II in cells treated with metformin + bafilomycin A1 (BAF A1, autophagy inhibitor) indicated that metformin enhanced autophagosome flux rather than stalled cargo degradation (Figure 4I). In addition, O cells had less co-localization of the mitochondrial protein translocase of outer membrane 20 protein (TOM20) and the lysosomal protein lysosome associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) than Y cells had, definitively confirming defective mitochondrial turnover was restored by metformin (Figures 4J and 4K). Metformin similarly increased expression of the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1), a mitochondrial indicator of improved health span in Drosophila (Rana et al., 2017) in cells from O subjects (Figure 4L). Metformin did not affect general indicators of autophagy, nor specific mitophagy indicators in Y cells (Figures 4E\u20134H and 4J\u20134L), and also failed to impact age-related decreases in humanin and prohibitin (Figures S4A and S4B), two mitokines that regulate inflammation in some circumstances (Conte et al., 2019, Zapa\u0142a et al., 2010, Kathiria et al., 2012). We conclude that mitochondrial turnover is defective in CD4+ T cells from older people, and that this defect, but not age-related declines in mitokines, is neutralized by metformin.",

Trimetazidine increased production of the Th17 cytokines IL-17A/F, IL-21, and IL-23 as previously reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Nicholas et al., 2019), although, in contrast to PBMCs, trimetazidine also activated Th1 cytokine production by CD4+ T cells (Figures 5A and S4C\u2013S4E). Trehalose did not affect cytokine production, as expected from the inability of metformin or other manipulations to alter Y cells. However, trehalose partially blocked trimetazidine-activated cytokine production (Figures 5A and S4C\u2013S4E), supporting the conclusion that autophagy improvement cannot entirely prevent inflammatory cytokine production by cells with compromised mitochondrial function.",

Atg3 knockdown in CD4+ T cells from Y subjects increased basal OCR, maximal OCR, OCR:ECAR ratio, and ROS to values indistinguishable from those of CD4+ T cells from O subjects (Figures 5B\u20135D). Furthermore, Atg3 knockdown in CD4+ T cells from Y subjects resulted in higher Th17 cytokine production (IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-21) that was indistinguishable from Th17 cytokines produced by O cells (Figure S5D). CCL-20 and GMCSF, two cytokines produced by both Th17 and Th1 cells, increased with Atg3 knockdown (Figure S5D). Other cytokines generally produced by other CD4+ T cell subsets variably changed with knockdown (Figure S5E). PLSDA analysis showed that Atg3 siRNA treatment of CD4+ T cells from Y subjects induced VIP cytokines that were very similar to the Th17 profile produced by cells from O subjects, and that the Th17 profile induced by siAtg3 was minimally changed by metformin (Figures 5E\u20135H; compare Figure 5F with Figure 1D).",

            "text": "Taken together, our data suggest that age-related autophagy decline may activate Th17 inflammaging through a metformin-sensitive mechanism. Corroborating evidence for this model includes metformin-sensitive under-expression of PINK-1, a key regulator of mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy; Geisler et al., 2010), in CD4+ T cells from O compared with Y subjects (Figure S6A). We used PINK-1 knockdown in CD4+ T cell from Y subjects (Figure S6B) to determine whether compromised mitophagy, rather than general macroautophagy, was a critical driver of the Th17 inflammaging profile. PINK-1 knockdown compromised Y function, as indicated by a metformin-sensitive increase in mitochondrial ROS, quantified by MitoSox fluorescence (Figure S6C), and accumulation of m-aconitase and Mitotracker green (Figures S6D and S6E), a surrogate for mitochondrial accumulation. TOM20/LAMP1 co-location definitely confirmed PINK-1 knockdown in Y cell decrease mitophagy (Figures S6F and S6G), although PINK-1 knockdown failed to more broadly change macroautophagy was indicated by lack of effect on LC3II expression (Figure S6H). PINK-1 knockdown insignificantly affected all cytokines, including those in the Th17 profile (Figure S6I). Our data indicate that Atg3-mediated autophagy activates Th17 cytokines independent of PINK-1-dependent mitophagy to support the conclusion that defective autophagy combines with suboptimal mitochondrial function, largely independent of mitophagy, to support the newly defined Th17 inflammaging profile. Our data support a model in which metformin increases non-mitochondrial autophagy in parallel with mitochondrial improvements to ameliorate one source of inflammaging.",

            "text": "To define molecular mechanisms that link autophagy and mitochondrial defects to Th17 inflammaging, we queried the effect of metformin on STAT3, a regulator of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Gough et al., 2009) and master regulator of Th17s (Wei et al., 2007, Wei et al., 2008), in CD4+ cells from O and Y subjects. Phospho-STAT3 serine 727 (p-S727 Stat3), modified for mitochondrial localization (Poli and Camporeale, 2015) co-localized more frequently with the mitochondrial complex 1 subunit NDUFA13/GRIMM19 in cells from O subjects (Figures 6A and 6B), suggesting STAT3 may mediate aging-associated changes in mitochondrial function. Metformin significantly lowered p-S727 STAT3 interaction with NDUFA13 in T cells from Y and O subjects (Figures 6A and 6B). Similarly, phospho-STAT3 with the nuclear localization/DNA-binding Y705 modification (Guadagnin et al., 2015) was twice as abundant in CD4+ T cells from O subjects compared with Y subjects (Figure 6C), further suggesting age-related changes in STAT3 function. Metformin, but not the general ROS scavenger Tempol, decreased p-T705 STAT3 in CD4+ T cells from O, but (for metformin) not Y subjects (Figures 6C and 6D), indicating that metformin is not solely acting on STAT modification through ROS mitigation. Conversely, Atg3-specific siRNA increased p-T705 STAT3 in CD4+ T cells from Y subjects in a metformin-independent mechanism (Figure 6C). Binding of p-Y705 STAT3 to the IL-17A and IL-17F promoters was higher in CD4+ T cells from O compared to Y subjects and was metformin-sensitive (Figure 6E). Together these data support the model that less non-mitochondrial autophagy in T cells from O subjects converges with changes in mitochondrial function and thereby redox balance to promote a Th17 inflammaging profile (Figure 6F). Metformin-mediated repair of these defects, either alone or in combination, ameliorates age-related inflammation.",
