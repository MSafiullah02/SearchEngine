SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and can lead to acute respiratory syndrome, hospitalization and death. 1 As of 12 March 2020, the global SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been declared a pandemic, with 125 048 cases, and 4613 deaths have been notified by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 117 countries/territories or areas worldwide (who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/situation-reports). The first case in Latin America was confirmed on 26 February 2020, in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolis, the most populous city in the Southern hemisphere (\u223c11 million people, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica, www.ibge.gov.br). Self-declared travel history and subsequent genetic analyses confirmed that the first detected infection was acquired via importation of the virus from Northern Italy. 2 Since then, Brazil has reported the largest number of cases in Latin America (n = 34, as of 10 March 2020). SARS-CoV-2 has been now detected in 7 (26%) of the 27 federal states of Brazil. So far, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be primarily sporadic (85.3%, 29/34 are imported cases).",

We estimate that 54.8% of all imported cases would be expected to come from travellers infected in Italy and 9.3% and 8.3% of the cases would be from travellers infected in China and France, respectively. The route Italy-S\u00e3o Paulo was estimated to comprise 24.9% of total infected travellers flying to Brazil during this period. Moreover, we estimate that Italy has been the source location for five of the top 10 importation routes for infected travellers into Brazil based on the current epidemiological scenario (Supplementary data). Consistent with this, at least 48% (n = 14/29) of the reported imported cases in Brazil have a history of travelling to Italy prior to onset of symptoms, as of 9 March 2020. Six (23.1%) of the confirmed cases that acquired the virus in Italy have been identified in S\u00e3o Paulo (Supplementary data).",

Our study has several limitations. Unfortunately, data from Iran and Portugal were not available for this analysis. Moreover, our analysis relies on incidence data, and thus, the risk of importation will follow changes in epidemic sizes at source locations. In fact, with the reduction in the number of flights leaving from Italy and 51% of flights to Brazil departing from airports in the USA, we should anticipate an increasing proportion of infected travellers arriving from the USA. Moreover, the estimated risk of importation from China is likely an overestimate as recent measures have extensively decreased the flights to Brazil.",
