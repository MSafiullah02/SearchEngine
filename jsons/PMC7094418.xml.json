            "text": "It has been an urgent desire to find a simple reliable, and economic method for protein purification during the postgenomic era. For this purpose, a lot of protein purification methods have been explored. Among them, Meyer and Chilkoti reported a nonchromatographic method for purification of recombinant proteins using an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)\n2 tag [1]. The ELP tag is an artificial biopolymer consisting of repeating pentapeptides, Val-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly (VPGXG), where Xaa can be any amino acid except Pro [2]. The ELP can undergo a reversible phase transition from soluble forms into aggregates by increasing the salt concentration or heating. The ELP aggregates can be recovered by centrifugation and resolubilized in buffer at a temperature below the transition temperature. Importantly, target proteins fused to the ELP tag still retain the phase transition behavior [1]. This characteristic transition allows the recombinant ELP fusion protein to be isolated from the cell lysate by repeated steps of aggregation, centrifugation, and resolubilization without chromatography. This nonchromatographic method for protein purification was termed as inverse transition cycling (ITC) [1], [3]. Recombinant ELP fusion proteins at different expression levels can be efficiently recovered by the ITC method [4], [5]. In addition to simple separation of recombinant proteins, ultra-high-level recombinant proteins can be produced by fusion with the ELP tag [6]. Due to the attractive advantages of the ELP tag, various proteins of interest have been expressed and purified using the ITC method [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. For crystal structural and biochemical characterization, however, it is necessary to remove the ELP tag from the target proteins. Cleavage of fusion proteins using proteases is feasible, but an additional purification step is needed to remove the proteases, and this is time-consuming. To solve this problem, self-cleaving ELP tags have been devised for purification of the tag-free recombinant proteins without using proteases [12], [13].",

The principle using ELP-tagged proteases for the separation of tag-free target proteins is shown in Fig. 1\n. The human rhinovirus 3C protease and small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) protease from yeast were used to demonstrate the proof-of-principle for this method. The human rhinovirus 3C protease is a specific protease that recognizes a peptide LEVLFQ/GP and cleaves between the Gln and Gly residues [14]. SUMO protease can recognize the tertiary structure of SUMO moiety instead of a peptide sequence and cleave in the diglycine motif at the junction between SUMO and the target proteins [15], [16]. Both proteases have been expressed and purified from Escherichia coli\n[16], [17].",

The ELP\u2013GFP was purified by ITC as described above. It was shown that highly purified ELP\u2013GFP was recovered after two rounds of ITC (Fig. 2B, lane 4). To release the ELP tag from the GFP, the ELP\u2013GFP was digested using ELP\u20133C protease at a protease-to-substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) in 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], and 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) at 5 \u00b0C for 16 h. SDS\u2013PAGE analysis showed that the ELP\u2013GFP was efficiently digested by ELP\u20133C protease. After enzymatic cleavage, NaCl was added into the digestion mixtures to trigger the phase transition of ELP, resulting in aggregation of the cleaved ELP tag and ELP\u20133C protease. After centrifugation at 14,000g at room temperature for 10 min, the supernatants and pellet were analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE. Only the GFP band was found in the supernatants (Fig. 2B, lane 7). The cleaved ELP tag, ELP\u20133C protease, and undigested ELP\u2013GFP were separated from the GFP and kept in the pellet (Fig. 2B, lane 6). The purified GFP that we obtained was approximately 25.6 mg/L. The fluorescence of purified GFP was detected by a fluorescence microscopy. The same method was successfully used to purify another tested protein, maltose binding protein (MBP) (Fig. 2C). Because it is efficient to purify the tag-free recombinant protein using ELP\u20133C protease, we purified several other proteins with various sizes, including glutathione S-transferase, thioredoxin, and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV) nucleocapsid (data not shown).",

            "text": "The use of ELP\u20133C protease for enzymatic cleavage of fusion protein has several advantages. First, ELP\u20133C protease is easy to produce in ordinary laboratories because the procedure for preparation of ELP\u20133C protease is simple, and this can save the cost of buying commercial proteases. Second, ELP-tagged protease as well as the cleaved ELP tag can be removed from the target proteins easily by centrifugation after the triggering phase transition of the ELP, so it saves time, labor, and cost. Third, higher yield of the recombinant proteins can be achieved compared with that of the utility of the self-cleaving ELP tag given that there is no risk of premature cleavage of the fusion protein containing a protease recognition site in vivo. Besides 3C protease, the principle can also be applied to other proteases for various purposes. Unlike 3C protease, SUMO protease from yeast recognizes the tertiary structure of the SUMO tag and releases the target protein with no additional amino acids at the N terminus, which is considered as a robust protease [15], [16]. Therefore, ELP\u2013SUMO protease has also been expressed and isolated by ITC from E. coli (Fig. 2D). The yield of purified ELP\u2013SUMO protease was approximately 11.8 mg/L. ELP\u2013SUMO protease could efficiently digest the ELP\u2013SUMO\u2013GFP to release the GFP from the ELP\u2013SUMO tag (Fig. 2E, lane 5). But a band of ELP\u2013SUMO was observed in addition to the GFP band in the PAGE gel after ITC (Fig. 2E, lane 7), suggesting that the ELP\u2013SUMO was not completely precipitated. To solve this problem, the free ELP protein was added to the digestions to facilitate the aggregation of ELP-SUMO. After triggering the transition of ELP, ELP\u2013SUMO and free ELP were coaggregated and completely separated from GFP by centrifugation (data not shown). The final yield of GFP was approximately 17.1 mg/L. ELP-tagged SUMO protease can be applied to isolate target proteins with a native N terminus.",
