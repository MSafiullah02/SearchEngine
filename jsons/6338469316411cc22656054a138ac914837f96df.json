            "text": "Brucella ovis infection results in genital damage and epididymitis in rams, placental inflammation and rare abortion in ewes, and neonatal mortality in lambs. However, the mechanism underlying B. ovis infection remains unclear. In the present study, we used prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wild-type B. ovis and intracellular B. ovis in RAW264.7 macrophages. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed, and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the top 10 upregulated and downregulated DEGs. The results showed that 212 genes were differentially expressed, including 68 upregulated and 144 downregulated genes, which were mainly enriched in 30 GO terms linked to biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. KEGG analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, beta-alanine metabolism, and quorum sensing pathway. BME_RS01160, BME_RS04270, BME_RS08185, BME_RS12880, BME_RS25875, predicted_RNA865, and predicted_RNA953 were confirmed with the transcriptome sequencing data. Hence, our findings not only reveal the intracellular parasitism of B. ovis in the macrophage immune system, but also help to understand the mechanism of chronic B. ovis infection.",

Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate. It is used for replenishment and biosynthesis of carboxylase, which results in a 5-10% CO 2 necessity for the growth and reproduction of B. ovis [11] . Moreover, it has been reported that B. ovis is naturally rough and does not contain Opolysaccharide, and has characteristics similar to smooth Brucella [12] . In a previous study, B. ovis infection in sheep was linked to epididymitis, orchitis, and infertility. The ABC transporter and virB operon-encoded type IV secretion system were shown to affect B. ovis survival and reproduction in sheep macrophages [13] . B. ovis is naturally rough, and induces toxic effects in sheep. B. ovis only infects its preferred host, and there are no reports of B. ovis infecting humans in natural environment. Further, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core structure is crucial for the in vivo survival of not only B. ovis but also other naturally rough Brucella pathogenic species. Hence, the LPS core of B. ovis is considered as a potential target for vaccine development [14] .",

The concentration and purity of total RNA were determined using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. RNA integrity was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the RIN value was determined using the Agilent 2100 software. Total RNA required for a single database establishment was 2 \u03bcg (concentration \u2265 100 ng/\u03bcL, OD 260/280: 1.8-2.2). Unlike eukaryotes, which have a poly A tail at the 3' mRNA end, prokaryotes cannot use oligo dT primers to pair with poly A (for A-T base pairing) to separate mRNA from total RNA. Therefore, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was extracted for further transcription analysis. The Illumina platform was used for sequencing short sequence fragments. The enriched mRNA was a complete RNA sequence, and needed to be interrupted randomly. By adding fragmentation buffer, mRNA can be randomly broken into small segments of about 200 bp. Under the action of reverse transcriptase, first strand cDNA was synthesized using random primers and mRNA as a template, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis. dTTP was replaced with dUTP in the dNTP reagent to synthesize second strand cDNA containing A/U/C/G. The double-stranded cDNA had sticky ends, which were filled with an end repair mix to create blunt ends. An A was then added at the 3 'end to connect the Y-junction adaptor.",

Their main function is to phagocytize (phagocytosis and digestion) cell fragments and pathogens in the form of fixed or free cells, and activate lymphocytes or other immune cells in response to pathogens. Macrophages are immune cells with diverse functions. They play important roles in phagocytosis, cellular immunity, and molecular immunology [24] [25] [26] . In the era of single-cell biology, the defense system is quite simple. Macrophages engulf and degrade foreign bodies, which are then excreted from the body as waste products. When the body is subjected to threat by viruses and heterologous proteins, the immune system is impaired. Hence, when organisms evolve to vertebrates, they form a new defense system [27] [28] [29] .",

            "text": "The survival and replication of pathogenic Brucella in phagocytes is an important aspect for the study of brucellosis. Previously, in a model of phagocytes with B. ovis infection, the proliferation and survival of phagocytes was shown to depend on virB2 and vjbR [30] . Besides, another study showed that a mutant B. ovis strain lacking a specific ABC transporter was attenuated in mice and could not survive in macrophages, mainly due to the decrease in the abundance of virB8 and virB11 protein in type IV secretion system [31] . Furthermore, the B. ovis \u0394abcAB strain was unable to survive in peritoneal macrophages, extracellular macrophages, or RAW264.7 macrophages, suggesting that ABC transporters are required for the complete virulence and survival of B. ovis [32] . Brucella establishes an intracellular replication niche in macrophages, and the immune system of macrophages uses its inherent defense mechanism to eliminate the invading bacteria. Through transcriptome analysis, it has been shown that macrophages infected with B. melitensis, B. neotomae, and B. ovis elicit a natural immune response, increase the transcription level of chemokines and defense response genes, and decrease GTPase signal transduction and cytoskeleton function, which subsequently mediate the transport of Brucella vesicles [33] . B. ovis infection has been shown to cause brucellosis in sheep, which is characterized by infertility in sheep, abortion in ewes, and increased perinatal mortality in lambs. Moreover, B. ovis infection was also shown to result in upregulation of phagocytosis-related genes and downregulation of protective host defense mechanism, which may help to explain the molecular mechanism underlying B. ovis chronic infection [34] . However, the mechanism of B. ovis infection and its persistence remain clear. The vast majority of studies focus on host changes after Brucella infection, and rarely on the survival of Brucella in the host immune system. Here, with an aim to reveal the survival and replication mechanism of B. ovis in the macrophage immune system, RAW264.7 macrophage cells were infected with B. ovis. The total RNA of intracellular and wild-type B. ovis were then extracted and used for prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing. GO functional enrichment analysis of DEGs showed they were mainly involved in 30 GO functions. Among them, protein-containing complex (GO:0032991), inorganic molecular entity transport (GO:0015318), anion transmembrane transport (GO:0008509), carboxylic acid transmembrane (GO:0046943), and amide biosynthetic process (GO:0043604) were identified as the top 5 GO functions. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in quorum sensing (ko02024), beta-alanine metabolism (ko00410), MAPK signaling pathway (ko04016), and HIF-1 signaling pathway (ko04066).",

            "text": "A previous study reported that in Brucella-induced acute inflammation, the content of serum iron is reduced and the transcription of fibroblast growth factor 23 is increased by activating the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway [35] . Dextran sulfate sodium-induced stimulation of MAPK signaling and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38\u03b1 has been shown to enhance adhesion and phagocytosis of Brucella in macrophages, which may be closely related to its ability to impair the innate immune system of macrophages, thus leading to Brucella survival and chronic infection [36] . The survival of Brucella in human monocytes has been reported to be regulated by the MAPK signaling pathway, which activates inflammatory responses through TLR2 [37] . Beta-alanine is a kind of functional amino acid, which plays a key role in regulating metabolism. As an intermediate product of coenzyme A and pantothenic acid, betaalanine affects population changes of Brucella [38] [39] [40] [41] . Quorum sensing was speculated to play an important role in controlling the virulence of Brucella [42] . VjbR is a transcriptional regulator of the virulence gene of Brucella, and the vjbR mutant has been shown to downregulate the expression of virB operon and flagellum genes in macrophages [43] . When the microbial population reaches a certain density level, the concentration of signaling molecules reaches a threshold value. By signal transduction through related proteins, including receptor protein kinases, signals are transmitted across the cells, thus affecting the expression of specific genes and regulating the physiological characteristics of microbial populations [44] [45] [46] . Bacteria use quorum sensing for cell-to-cell communication and coordination of activities in the complex environment, which enables the entire bacterial population to survive [47] [48] [49] . As a major regulatory system of Brucella, quorum sensing may play an important role in the spatial and sequential adaptation of Brucella to host environment [50] . Compared with conventional culture of B. ovis, in this study, for the first time, we identified the DEGs in the immune system of B. ovis-challenged macrophages, and analyzed the biological functions and signaling pathways associated with them, which laid the foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanism of intracellular parasitism and persistent infection of B. ovis.
