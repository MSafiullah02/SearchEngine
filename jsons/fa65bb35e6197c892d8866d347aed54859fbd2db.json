The morphogenesis and proliferative rule of TGEV in porcine IECs were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence assays and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. Observations under the TEM indicated that the enveloped viral particles were roughly spherical, with diameters of between 80 and 120 nm. The virions entered porcine IECs by membrane fusion and the mature viruses in the vacuoles were transported to the cell membrane before release. The results also showed that from 0 to 12 h after TGEV infection of porcine IECs, the intracellular viral RNA content did not change significantly. Logarithmic growth occurred from 12 to 36 h, after which it gradually decreased. Moreover, the extracellular RNA content began to rise at 24 h after inoculation and then reduced gradually at approximately 48 h. This study provided a theoretical foundation for further study on the infection characteristics of TGEV in target cells.",

TGE results in serious economic losses in swine-producing areas worldwide. TGEV has a large, 28.5 kb single-stranded positive sense RNA genome, which comprises four structural proteins encoded by the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleoprotein (N) genes (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Eleouet et al., 1995) . Many cell types are susceptible to TGEV, including pig thyroid cells, swine testis cells (ST), pig kidney cells (PK-15, IBRS-2) and salivary gland cells (Nguyen et al., 1987; Haelterman and Hutchings, 1956) . IBRS-2, PK-15 and ST cell lines are used commonly to culture TGEV in the laboratory (Chen et al., 1993) . In vivo, TGEV replicates in intestinal epithelial cells of susceptible animals, causing cellu-lar degeneration, villus shortening, malabsorption and diarrhea (Haelterman,1972; Schwegmaan-wessels and Herrler, 2006) .",

            "text": "Most studies concerning TGEV pathogenesis in swine have been performed in animal infection models. Only rarely have in vitro studies been used with cell lines originating from porcine intestines. Cell lines IPEC-1, IPEC-J2 and IPI-2I have been used in in vitro model systems (Fangning et al., 2010; Valentina et al., 2009; Peter et al., 2006) . However, data concerning these cell lines, and the morphogenesis and proliferation of the virus in the target cells, are scarce. Thus, we developed an in vitro model based on porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) infected with TGEV, and used transmission electron microscopy (TEM), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) to investigate the infection mechanism of TGEV. TGEV N genes are highly homologous and are essential for replication. The N gene encodes the nucleocapsid protein, which is a highly basic protein with a molecular mass ranging from 40 to 63 kDa, depending on the species and strain (Escors et al., 2001) . The N protein's function involves cessation of cell division and extension of the cell cycle to provide more suitable conditions for virus assembly (Liu et al., 2001Motokawa et al., 1996 Kapke and Brian, 1986) . This is especially significant when the viral life cycle is longer than that of the host cell cycle (Wurm et al., 2001) . Therefore, to anahttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.09.018 0166-0934/\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

At 6 h post-infection, many TGEV particles bound to goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC showed green fluorescence when exposed to laser light and were located in the cytoplasm. At 24 h, the fluorescence transferred to the perinuclear area, before decreasing gradually at 48 h. Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a cellular receptor for TGEV, is abundantly expressed in the membrane of porcine IECs (data not shown), which suggested that pAPN plays a role in mediating TGEV infection. In addition, we demonstrated that ST cells could be infected with the culture supernatant of IECs infected TGEV at 24 h.

            "text": "FQ-PCR was used to quantify TGEV inside porcine IECs in comparison with the SC-TGEV virus inside PK-15 cells (Dai et al., 2012) . The one-step growth curve of TGEV in porcine IECs showed that the amount of viral RNA did not change significantly from 0 to 12 h post-infection, whereas Dai et al. showed that in PK-15 cells, the RNA increased rapidly from 2 to 8 h. The viral RNA displayed a logarithmic increase in porcine IECs from 12 to 36 h, while Dai et al. showed that the viral RNA was maintained at high level and entered into stationary phase gradually. Extracellular TGEV RNA levels were unchanged at 0 to 24 h post-infection of porcine IECs, and increased logarithmically until reaching maximum at 36 h, before decreasing gradually. In PK-15 cells, Dai et al. demonstrated that extracellular TGEV RNA levels increased logarithmically at 6-28 h post-infection, and maintained relatively stable and high level at 28-32 h. The differences between the curves indicated that differences in virulence and cell types might lead to changes in virus replication. The onestep growth curve of TGEV revealed the rule of virus proliferation, and thus will provide further guidance for clarifying the infection mechanism of TGEV.",
