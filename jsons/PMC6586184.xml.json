Current knowledge explains the detection of human influenza viruses in feces because of (i) swallowing of influenza viruses from the upper respiratory tract; (ii) remnants of infected submucosal intestinal antigen\u2010presenting immune cells; and (iii) virus replication in intestinal cells.8 The significance of the detection of influenza viral RNA in stools, their dissemination on GI tract, their correlation with GI symptoms, and their viability in stool remain unclear and are still debated.7, 18\n",

These symptoms could be caused by other enteric pathogens or allergy,33 intolerance,34 or toxin35 responsible for GI symptoms and present on shellfish and mollusks. Among the patients with antibiotic or antiviral drug prescriptions, we did not collect data on GI symptom development after GP consultation, but stool samples were collected 2 days after GP consultation; therefore, patients had started antibiotic and/or antiviral treatment at time of stool collection. We could make the assumption that disruption of the gut microflora leads to an increase in swallowing and gastric flu, which helps influenza viruses reach the lower gastrointestinal tract.
