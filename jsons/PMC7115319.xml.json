Moreover, the application process for the children in the classroom was usually brief and did not disturb the regular classroom schedule. The cost of the use of alcohol hand gel every 60 minutes was $6.39 per child per 12-week period; however, the effect size of the intervention was substantial, considering the reduced rate of absenteeism for ILI and the associated lost time from work for parents and costs related to doctor visits and antibiotic prescriptions.",

Especially in those children who did not visit a doctor, allergy symptoms could have been easily misclassified during the telephone interview (the baseline data show that 37.37% of the students reported an allergic disorders as the underlying disease), as well as those who had ILI that attended school regardless of being ill or not.",
