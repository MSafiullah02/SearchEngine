The probability of fixation depends on the fitness of the mutation, and the arising variant can be deleterious, neutral, or beneficial. Despite its relevance, only few studies have estimated the distribution of fitness effects caused by random single mutations on protein function. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease was chosen as a model protein to quantify protein's tolerability to random single mutations. After determining the enzymatic activity of 107 single random mutants, we found that 86% of single mutations were deleterious for the enzyme catalytic efficiency and 54% lethal. Only 2% of the mutations significantly increased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. These data demonstrate the vulnerability of HIV-1 protease to single random mutations. When a second random mutagenesis library was constructed from an HIV-1 protease carrying a highly deleterious single mutation (D30N), a higher proportion of mutations with neutral or beneficial effect were found, 26% and 9%, respectively. Importantly, antagonist epistasis was observed between deleterious mutations. In particular, the mutation N88D, lethal for the wild-type protease, restored the wild-type catalytic efficiency when combined with the highly deleterious mutation D30N. The low tolerability to single random substitutions shown here for the wild-type HIV-1 protease contrasts with its in vivo ability to generate an adaptive variation. Thus, the antagonist epistasis between deleterious or lethal mutations may be responsible for increasing the protein mutational robustness and evolvability.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Robustness defined as a protein's tolerance to substitutions is of fundamental importance to understand natural or artificial protein evolution.

The viral protease is the enzyme required for processing the gag and gag-pol polyproteins to yield mature, infectious virions. We used PCR mutagenesis to generate a randomly mutated library of the HIV-1 protease (HXB2 strain) (table 1) To determine the enzymatic activity of the different identified single-mutant proteases, a phage lambda-based genetic screen was used. This genetic screen is based on the phage lambda regulatory circuit in which the viral repressor cI is specifically cleaved to initiate the lysogenic to lytic switch (Sices and Kristie 1998) . Introduction of an HIV-1 protease in a wild-type phage will cleave a mutant cI repressor containing a specific HIV-1 protease cleavage site, allowing the phage to go into the lytic replication cycle. As we have previously demonstrated, the cI repressor cleavage is directly proportional to the protease catalytic efficiency (Martinez et al. 2000; Cabana et al. 2002; Martinez and Clotet 2003; Parera et al. 2004 ). Likewise, we have also shown that the enzyme activities determined with this genetic screen were affecting to a similar extent the ex vivo replication capacity of the virus (Cabana et al. 2002; Fernandez G, Clotet B, Martinez MA, submitted) . The introduction of different protease variants in the HIV-1 infectious clone pNL4.3luc 1 R \u00c0 E \u00c0 A confirmed that HIV-1 growth was proportional to the enzyme activity observed with the genetic screen used here (Fernandez G, Clotet B, Martinez MA, submitted) (data not shown). This HIV-1 protease genetic screen model has to be seen as a complement to the classical biochemical approach for monitoring protease proteolytic activity. The enzymatic activities of the different single-variant proteases analyzed in this study were related to the activity of the wild-type HXB2 protease (100%) ( fig. 1 ). Fifty-eight (54.2%) mutations were lethal (t-test, P , 0.05), 34 (31.7%) were deleterious (t-test, P , 0.05), 13 (12.1%) had no significant effect (t-test, P , 0.05), and 2 (1.9%) were significantly beneficial (t-test, P , 0.05) ( fig. 1 ). The average effect on the catalytic efficiency of the 34 deleterious mutations was \u00c071.6%. For the 13 neutral and 2 beneficial mutations, the average effect was 1.0% and 52.5%, respectively. As expected, several lethal or highly deleterious mutants were located in conserved residues critical to the structure and function of the protease (Loeb et al. 1989; Rao et al. 1991; Ishima et al. 2001 ) as the active site (amino acids 22-34), the flap (amino acids 47-52), and amino acids 84-94 which encompass a single a-helix that interacts with the substrate. Nevertheless, the former preserved coding regions were not the only residues in which lethal or deleterious mutations were found ( fig. 1 ). Residues located outside the above 3 critical regions in which we found lethal or highly deleterious mutants (V11, E21, L38, G40, V56, Y59, G68, V75, L76, T80, P81, G94, C95, and T96) were absent or rarely mutated in drug-naive infected individuals (Wu et al. 2003; Ceccherini-Silberstein et al. 2004 ), confirming the possible in vivo lethal or deleterious effect caused by the former mutations. In contrast, neutral or beneficial mutations (L10, S37, L63, I64, and A71) were located in very well known polymorphic positions in the virus isolated from infected individuals (Wu et al. 2003; Ceccherini-Silberstein et al. 2004 ). Interestingly, 2 mutations at positions L10 and A71 could be strongly beneficial. It may be argued that our assay does not fully reflect the requirements for functionality of HIV-1 protease in vivo. Nevertheless, site-directed mutagenesis of residues L10 and A71 has demonstrated that viruses carrying these substitutions could be as infectious as the wild-type virus (Mammano et al. 2000) . A 3-dimensional image representing the crystallographic HIV-1 protease structure showed that most of the neutral or beneficial mutations were located at the peripheral areas of the enzyme and almost entirely positioned in surface loops far from the active-site and substrate-binding regions (not shown).

They include several enzymes that can tolerate many amino acid changes (Martinez et al. 1996; Guo et al. 2004) . Protein robustness seems to be a selectable trait because neutral mutations can be a key to future evolutionary innovations (Wagner 2005) . A recent evolution experiment demonstrated the evolutionary advantages of neutral mutations by showing that human or bacterial enzymes can acquire new functions without loosing their original functions (Aharoni et al. 2005) . This apparent selective advantage of robustness contrasts with the low tolerability to single substitutions demonstrated in this study for the HIV-1 protease, even with the high mutational burden faced by this protein. Here, we show that up to 54% of random single amino acid substitutions were lethal. Moreover, the average catalytic efficiency effect for the 32% of deleterious but nonlethal mutations was -72%. This high vulnerability to single mutations contrasts with the high HIV-1 protease genetic variability found within infected individuals (Wu et al. 2003; Ceccherini-Silberstein et al. 2004) . Especially intriguing is the extremely rapid evolvability displayed by this protein after protease inhibitor treatment (Condra et al. 1995) . HIV-1 protease can rapidly acquire mutations that lead to drug resistance but that barely affect its catalytic efficiency (Martinez-Picado et al. 1999; Nijhuis et al. 1999) . Moreover, up to 22 (22%) different residues have been associated with drug resistance (Johnson et al. 2005) . Although the high mutation rates and large population size of HIV-1 are obviously favoring the rapid evolvability of the HIV-1 protease (Domingo et al. 1997) , protein evolution also depends on a reduced lethality of mutations (Aharoni et al. 2005; Wagner 2005; Bloom, Labthavikul, et al. 2006) . After showing the low tolerability to single random substitutions of a high-fitness protein, we decided to explore the tolerance to single random amino acid substitutions of a low-fitness HIV-1 protease. The chosen lowfitness protein was the HXB2 protease carrying the single mutation D30N. This substitution is primarily associated to resistance to the HIV-1 protease inhibitor nelfinavir (Johnson et al. 2005) . It is very well known that this mutation impairs the enzyme's catalytic efficiency and the virus replication capacity (Martinez-Picado et al. 1999; Cabana et al. 2002) . Interestingly, we found a higher proportion of mutations with a neutral or beneficial effect with the low-fitness protease. When epistatic relationships were searched between the highly deleterious mutation D30N and the different single random mutations, strong antagonistic epistasis was found with some mutations. In particular, the substitutions N88D and D30N turned out to be strongly epistatic. Both mutations reduced the catalytic efficiency of the wildtype protease (N88D was lethal and D30N strongly deleterious), but together, their effect was better. Because the mutation D30N confers some resistance to the drug and emerges first during in vivo protease inhibitor resistance development (Martinez-Picado et al. 1999; Cabana et al. 2002) , the appearance of the mutation N88D would restore the catalytic defect originated by the D30N substitution.
