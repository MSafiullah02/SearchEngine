According to data from WHO, more than 1 500 000 people live with a transplanted organ worldwide. In the USA, approximately 40 000 patients receive an organ transplant every year, but 120 000 patients remain on a waiting list for transplantation, with 7600 individuals dying annually while waiting for an organ transplant. In Europe and many other countries, patients are affected by a similar scarcity of organs and high death rates while on the waiting list for transplantation.",

The effect was seen in France and confirmed in the USA. The overall reduction in deceased donor transplantations since the COVID-19 outbreak was 90\u00b76% in France and 51\u00b71% in the USA, respectively. In both France and the USA, this reduction was mostly driven by kidney transplantation, but a substantial effect was also seen for heart, lung, and liver transplants, all of which provide meaningful improvement in survival probability. In the appendix, the geographical association is shown between areas with COVID-19 clusters and the decrease in organ procurement, showing a significant reduction in transplantation rates even in regions where COVID-19 cases are low, suggesting a global and nationwide effect beyond the local COVID-19 infection prevalence.",

By using the example of organ transplantation, which is a highly regulated field and has a specific centralised day-to-day reporting scheme at a federal level, we show how high-value medical procedures can be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with outcomes for vulnerable patient groups. Furthermore, detailed cartographic mapping of trends in organ donation and transplant activity will enable targeted interventions when the burdens of COVID-19 get lighter. Some organ procurement organisations and their networks will undoubtedly recover more quickly than others through best practices and effective communication with hospitals. Careful mapping will enable public health leaders and transplant organisations to identify areas where transplants have not recovered well and support is needed.",
