HFNC is an oxygen supply system that provides a mixture of air and oxygen with a known concentration. HFNC provides high concentrations of humidified oxygen, low levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, and can facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide, potentially reducing the need for intubation compared with standard oxygen supplementation [12] [13] [14] . However, it should also be considered that there are no standard evidence-based guidelines for the use of HFNC, and that the experience in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is still limited (and without adjusted comparison to standard oxygen supplement) to provide universal recommendations, at least pending further data [9] . Other relevant things to be considered are: (i) HFNC should be used in settings with rapid availability of endotracheal intubation in the case of rapid deterioration [15] ; (ii) the possible increased risk of contracting the infection for healthcare personnel due to the aerosol generation should be appropriately managed (HFNC should be used in negative pressure rooms) [16] . These last two considerations also apply to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with helmet (the most frequent system of non-invasive mechanical ventilation employed in real life), that can be considered if the patient does not respond to standard or HFNC oxygen supplementation (i.e., if the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2] has a decreasing trend) and",

As for HFNC, also in the case of CPAP with helmet close monitoring and short interval assessment for worsening of respiratory failure is mandatory. In addition, it should be necessarily noted that, although CPAP with helmet has become an established procedure for primary hypoxemic lung failure in the last few years, some experts do not support its use for COVID-19 [17] , arguing that success rates in critically ill COVID-19 patients may be limited and there could be a risk of delayed intubation unfavorably influencing the outcome. On the other hand, considering the atypical physiopathology of acute lung injury in patients with COVID-19 [18] , gentle ventilation with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) not higher than 10-12 centimeters of water may represent a reasonable approach for avoiding excessive damage during CPAP with helmet, and possibly also the need for intubation. Large studies, possibly RCT, are urgently needed to definitely clarify the precise role of CPAP with helmet in patients with COVID-19. Finally, borrowing from what is already known and used in intensive care, pronation, although certainly more difficult to implement during non-invasive than invasive mechanical ventilation, may allow to improve gas exchange, decrease respiratory distress and promote lung recruitment [19] .",

Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor used for the treatment of HIV patients, administered in combination with ritonavir to improve its serum half-life. Based on its activity against SARS-CoV-1 and/or MERS-CoV observed in in vitro and animal studies [20] [21] [22] , lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) was compared to supportive care alone for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in an open-label RCT in China [23] . The primary time-to-event endpoint was clinical improvement from randomization (defined as a composite of discharge from the hospital or improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale, ranging from no need of hospitalization to death). Overall, 199 patients were enrolled (99 and 100 in the LPV/RTV and supportive care arms, respectively). No differences were observed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with regard to clinical improvement (hazard ratio [HR] 1.24 with standard of care as reference, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.72). In addition, no associations were observed with regard to 28-day mortality, although a lower number of deaths were registered in the LPV/RTV arm (19.2% vs. 25.0% in investigational and comparator arms, respectively; percentage difference \u22125.8%, 95% CI \u221217.3 to 5.7). Although some important considerations preclude a definite judgement on the possible efficacy of LPV/RTV (for example, some major limitations are the open-label nature of the trial and the fact that LPV/RTV was initiated late with respect to the onset of symptoms, see question 7), especially in the case of early initiation, the results of this RCT provide evidence currently discouraging the use of LPV/RTV (or of other protease inhibitors such as darunavir) in COVID-19 patients (also considering the potential side effects, see table 3), unless   favorable results from other ongoing RCT in specific subgroups of patients are available   (see table 2 ). Furthermore, harmful drug interactions of antivirals with other drugs (such as hydroxychloroquine) cannot be excluded a priori, since there are currently no large clinical data about the use of these combinations.",

For example, in a recent RCT comparing 120 COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir vs. 120 COVID-19 patients receiving umifenovir, higher rates of clinical recovery were observed in patients receiving favipiravir, but it is of note that the allcause mortality was 0% in the entire study population, making it uncertain as to whether, if confirmed, these favorable results may be extrapolated to relevant survival endpoints in critically ill COVID-19 patients [31] . Finally, antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro has been recently reported for ivermectin, but clinical data is still lacking [32] . CoV proteins, although other mechanisms may also contribute [33] [34] [35] [36] . With regard to the immunomodulatory effects, the attenuated production of TNF\u03b1, IL6, and interferons that follows the administration of chloroquine might help counteracting an exaggerated proinflammatory response, which is thought to contribute to the organ damage observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [37, 38] . On the other hand, some authors pointed out that also an unfavorable immunomodulatory effect cannot be excluded, based on a reduced T helper 2 differentiation [39] . In our opinion, hydroxychloroquine should be preferred over chloroquine because of its less toxic profile (reduced ocular toxicity and less drug interactions) and its more potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 [40] .",

For these reasons, hydroxychloroquine should be preferentially administered within the framework of investigational studies. When this is unfeasible, off-label use may be considered according to local protocols and consent procedures.

A meta-analysis on corticosteroid use in ARDS including eight controlled studies reported a significant reduction in markers of systemic inflammation, pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction scores, duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay [63] . A recent multicentre RCT included 277 patients with ARDS to assess the effects of dexamethasone treatment. Patients in the study arm received dexamethasone 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, which was reduced to 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. This study reported a significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation in the dexamethasone group than in the control group (between-group difference 4.8 days, p<0.0001) and a significant reduction in mortality at 60 days (between-group difference -15.3% p=0.0047). The proportion of adverse events did not differ significantly between the dexamethasone and the control group [64] . Data on the use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection is available, albeit with conflicting results. In a retrospective, observational study of 152 SARS-CoV-1 infected, critically ill patients, corticosteroids administration was found to reduce mortality and shorten the length of hospital stay (odds ratio 0.08, 95% confidence intervals 0.01-0.97, p=0.046). The study did not report increased secondary infections or other complications with corticosteroids administration [65] . Conversely, in a retrospective observational study on 309 critically ill patients with MERS-CoV the administration of a median hydrocortisone equivalent dose of 300 mg/day was not associated with a difference in 90-day mortality. In addition, corticosteroid administration was associated with delayed clearance of MERS-CoV RNA from the patients' respiratory tract [66] . With regard to other viral infections, it is worth noting that a recent meta-analysis on patients with influenza pneumonia (including ten observational studies with a total of 6548 included patients) depicted increased mortality (risk ratio: Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody inhibiting membrane-bound and soluble interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptors [69] , and is currently approved for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and patients with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or lifethreatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) [69, 70] . In this regard, tocilizumab may help to mitigate the CRS by decreasing cytokine concentrations and acute phase reactants production [71] . In a recent pre-print paper, Xiaoling Xu and colleagues reported their experience of treating 21 COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab. In their still to be peerreviewed case series, the following were observed after tocilizumab administration: (i) reduction in body temperature ( [72] .",

Although promising in pre-clinical studies, remdesivir should be currently used for treating COVID-19 patients only within RCT (preferentially) or compassionate/expanded-access programs, owing to its investigational nature. Pending high-level supporting evidence, favipiravir and umifenovir should not be used outside RCT, at least in those countries where they are not approved for other indications. Oseltamivir or zanamivir should be used only in the presence of suspected/proven concomitant influenza.",

This suggestion is based on its demonstrated activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 (although weak) and on the availability of lowlevel clinical evidence of anticipation of viral clearance from a small controlled, non-randomized study, although it should also be kept in mind that the study was highly susceptible to bias and there is still no data regarding hard clinical endpoints such as crude mortality. For these reasons, hydroxychloroquine should be preferentially administered within the framework of investigational studies. When this is unfeasible, off-label use may be considered according to local protocols and consent procedures. In view of the absence of evidence, we are currently unable to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients outside investigational studies. The same applies to prophylactic use.",

This suggestion is based on the fact that bacterial coinfection: (i) is common in patients with viral pneumonia; (ii) can be associated with a substantial risk of delaying appropriate treatment, thereby potentially increasing mortality. Because of the limited available data on both the microbiological epidemiology (and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance) of bacterial superinfections in COVID-19 patients, it is difficult to provide specific pathogen-oriented recommendations. Therefore, pending further studies, we suggest to empirically treat COVID-19 patients according to their clinical syndrome (e.g., community acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia), choosing the most suited antimicrobial agent/s based on local guidelines and local antibiotic susceptibility patterns, with early de-escalation or discontinuation according to microbiology results, whenever available.",

However, considering that overwhelming inflammation and cytokine-related lung injury might be responsible for rapidly progressive pneumonia and clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients, we suggest (expert opinion only) to consider administration of corticosteroids in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS or with worsening of non-ARDS respiratory failure in the absence of bacterial/fungal superinfections (independent of ICU admission).",

Corticosteroids should be initiated early in well-defined categories of patients (patients with ARDS or with worsening of non-ARDS respiratory failure in the absence of bacterial/fungal superinfections), while their role in other COVID-19 patients still remains uncertain. Although based on low-level evidence and pending RCT results, in our opinion early hydroxychloroquine administration should be considered in COVID-19 patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms, whereas further data is needed to better delineate the true balance between possible favorable effects and toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.",

If the administration of remdesivir is approved within compassionate/expanded access programs, treatment duration should follow compassionate or expanded access protocols (e.g., up to ten days according to the most recent compassionate protocol at the time of this review). If corticosteroids are administered, we suggest a total treatment duration of 7-10 days, with progressive dosage reduction.

Although promising in pre-clinical studies, remdesivir should be currently expanded-access programs, owing to its investigational nature. Pending high-level supporting evidence, favipiravir and umifenovir should not be used outside RCT, at least in those countries where they are not approved for other indications. Oseltamivir or zanamivir should be used only in the presence of suspected/proven concomitant influenza. Question 3. Should chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine be administered? The rationale of using chloroquine for treating COVID-19 patients is based on two potential, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: (i) antiviral activity; (ii) immunomodulatory effects. With regard to antiviral activity, chloroquine has been shown to inhibit various viruses in cell cultures, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, possibly via pHdependent inhibition of virus-endosome fusion and/or post-translational modifications of",

Of note, six patients treated with hydroxychloroquine also received azithromycin. The primary endpoint was virological clearance (based on results of real-time polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] on nasopharyngeal specimens) at day 6 after inclusion. At day 6, 70% (14/20) of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologically cured vs. 12.5% (2/16) in the control group (p = 0.001), although it cannot be excluded that selection bias and baseline viral load played a role in influencing results, thereby biasing results towards observing a favorable effect of hydroxychloroquine administration[43]. Furthermore, opposite results (apparent absence of reduction of viral clearance) were recently described by another French group (albeit in a very small sample size of 11 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin)[44]. Uncertainty also surrounds the more marked positive effect observed in patients receiving azithromycin in addition to hydroxychloroquine in the study by Gautret and colleagues, especially because of the very limited number of patients in the combined treatment subgroup and the possible increased risk of QT prolongation by combining the two drugs",

The recommended dose is 4-8 mg/kg or 400mg standard dose IV once, with the option to repeat a dose after 8-12 hours (not to exceed a total dose of 800mg). However, it should be noted that the optimal time for administering tocilizumab has not been fully elucidated yet, nor is there a clear IL-6 threshold associated with progression to severe disease. At the time of writing, there are at least 10 ongoing RCT evaluating efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients (seetable 2).Other immune modulatory drugs including anakinra (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) or Janus kinase family enzyme inhibitors have been proposed for the management of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Notably, there is currently no supporting clinical evidence, and RCT are ongoing (see table 2)[68,74].Finally, modifications of the immune response through administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin or convalescent plasma have also been proposed or used in small case series, and merit further investigation in dedicated RCT[75][76][77][78][79].Question 6 statementOwing to the lack of high-level evidence, administration of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 should preferentially occur within the framework of RCT. Off-label use according to local protocols and consent procedures may be considered only in those COVID-19 patients excluded from RCT (or hospitalized where RCT are not available or still to be implemented) and who are worsening while receiving standard supportive care (in the absence of concomitant/superimposed infections). In our opinion, this could be a reasonable off-label use of tocilizumab in these early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, although patients and physicians should be fully aware that currently there is only a nonpeer-reviewed, non-comparative, observational experience (very low evidence from an unreviewed cases series) and that it only supports a potential favorable effect on inflammatory signs and symptoms, while there is no information on any possible effect on survival.",

            "text": "What is the optimal timing of treatment initiation?Most clinical data on the timing of antiviral therapy initiation are derived from studies on viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, and it remains unclear as to whether these data can be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies in SARS-CoV-1 and influenza showed a possible favorable impact on mortality of early initiation of antiviral treatment after symptoms onset[80][81][82][83]. With regard to SARS-CoV-2, although the results of the previously cited RCT comparing LPV/RTV vs. standard of care eventually does not support the use of LPV/RTV in patients with COVID-19, it is also of note that the median time between symptom onset and randomization was 13 days (interquartile range 11 to 16 days), thus, in most cases, the drug was initiated late during the course of the disease[23]. Consequently, we cannot exclude that an earlier initiation of LPV/RTV may be associated with improved prognosis. In this regard, we think the results of this RCT may serve as hypothesis-generating findings to guide the design of further RCT evaluating the efficacy of LPV/RTV (and/or other antivirals) in an earlier phase of the disease. However, until such RCT will be available, we still feel the currently available clinical evidence is still insufficient to support the use of LPV/RTV and/or other antivirals for treating COVID-19 outside the framework of RCT or compassionate use programs.The optimal time of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids initiation still remains unknown. Although based on low-level evidence, the positive effect of viral clearance observed by Gautret and colleagues was observed in a mixed group of non-ICU patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms, non-ICU patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms and asymptomatic subjects, which overall may support a positive effect of early hydroxychloroquine initiation in non-ICU settings (although information on the exact time of treatment initiation with respect to symptoms onset was not provided)[42]. With regard to steroid treatment, there is currently no evidence of a positive impact of early initiation in non-critically ill, non-ARDS patients. Although lack of evidence is not a synonym of lack of effect, in our opinion steroid treatment, considering also its potential detrimental effects, should currently be limited to ARDS patients or non-ARDS patients with worsening conditions (see question 5).Question 7 statement Supportive therapy (symptomatic therapy, rehydration and oxygen supplementation, if necessary), should be initiated as soon as the patient presents with respiratory or systemic symptoms including severe asthenia, high fever, persistent cough, and/or clinical or radiological signs of lung involvement. Pending further evidence, in our opinion antiviral treatments should not be initiated in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside RCT or compassionate use programs (with the exception of early oseltamivir initiation in patients with suspected concomitant influenza). Corticosteroids should be initiated early in welldefined categories of patients (patients with ARDS or with worsening of non-ARDS respiratory failure in the absence of bacterial/fungal superinfections), while their role in other COVID-19 patients still remains uncertain. Although based on low-level evidence and pending RCT results, in our opinion early hydroxychloroquine administration should be considered in COVID-19 patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms, whereas further data is needed to better delineate the true balance between possible favorable effects and toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Question 8. What is the optimal treatment duration? In the absence of proven effective treatment, also treatment duration remains unclear, and it is currently based on expert opinion based on treatment durations in other approved indications for the employed drugs and aimed at a balance between potential activity and risk of undesired side effects. Nonetheless, suggested durations vary markedly. For example, a wide range of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine treatment durations (from 5 to 20 days) have been recommended/used in different centers/studies, making it impossible to provide an univocal recommendation in the absence of direct comparisons of different lengths of treatment with regard to relevant clinical endpoints (e.g., mortality, ICU",

However, considering that overwhelming inflammation and cytokine-related lung injury might be responsible for rapidly progressive pneumonia and clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients [45, 59, 68], we suggest (expert opinion only) to consider administration of corticosteroids in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS or with worsening of non-ARDS respiratory failure in the absence of bacterial/fungal superinfections (independent of ICU admission). On the other hand, in the absence of convincing evidence the following cannot currently be supported: (i) steroid administration stratified according to inflammatory markers; (ii) steroid administration in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients.",
