            "text": "Although all proteolytic enzymes perform the same basic function, namely the cleavage of a carbon-nitrogen bond between two amino acids in a peptide or protein, they are otherwise remarkably diverse. There are two very different catalytic mechanisms. Most proteolytic enzymes are peptidases that activate a water molecule which results in hydrolysis of the peptide bond (classified as hydrolases in Enzyme Nomenclature, subclass EC 3.4) [1]. However, there are a small number of self-processing peptidases that are not hydrolases but which bring about peptide bond cleavage by the rearrangement (cyclization) of an asparagine residue to a succinimide [2]; these are lyases (EC subclass 4.3). Amongst the peptidases, there are at least six different nucleophiles that bring about hydrolysis. In three of these activated water is bound to either aspartic acid residues (aspartic peptidases), glutamic acid residues (glutamic peptidases) or one or two metal ions (metallopeptidases). In the other three, the nucleophile is the hydroxyl of a serine (serine peptidases) or threonine (threonine peptidases) residue, or the thiol of a cysteine residue (cysteine peptidases). Although most frequently thought to be a triad [3], the catalytic mechanism can be dependent upon only two residues, for example endopeptidase La (family S16) [4], or in the case of metallopeptidases, may include many more. Metallopeptidases can rely upon one or two metal ions, in which case the metal is bound to the protein via three (one metal) or five (cocatalytic metals) residues [5]. The metal, although most frequently zinc, can also be cobalt, manganese, iron or copper. Then there are differences in activity. Many peptidases are endopeptidases, but there are also aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidases, peptidyl-dipeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases and tripeptidyl-peptidases. Endopeptidases can also be restricted in the length of a peptide that can be cleaved (oligopeptidases) or many cleave peptide bonds that form between amino acid sidechains (isopeptidases). In a very few cases, peptide cleavage is associated with the transfer of another moiety to one of the free termini generated by the cleavage (transpeptidases) [6]. The number of different families of proteolytic enzymes, assembled from statistically significant similarities in protein sequence, is large. Even if the similarity in tertiary structures of proteolytic enzymes are taken into account, which reveals homologies not visible when only sequences are examined, there is still considerable variety. Usually, all the members of a single family utilize the same catalytic dyad or triad, or the same metal ligands for a metallopeptidase, but it does not follow that all members of a family are endopeptidases or exopeptidases, or that all members of a metallopeptidase family use the same divalent metal ions [7].",

            "text": "A family of peptidases was assembled initially using the protein sequence of a well-characterized peptidase, for example bovine chymotrypsin, known as the \u201ctype example\u201d. To find homologues of a type example, sequence searches were conducted against either the UniProt knowledgebase [9] or the non-redundant protein sequence library at NCBI [10] using BlastP [11]. Within a family, other well characterized proteolytic enzymes with different substrate preferences were identified manually and each of these was designated a \u201cholotype\u201d for a particular set of substrate preferences. Any of these holotypes could be used for subsequent BlastP searches to identify more homologues in the family. Additionally, the sequence of the type example could be used to search for homologues in the UniProt knowledgebase using the HMMER3 website [12]. BlastP searches with holotype sequences other than the type example were necessary for any family in which there are more than 20,000 known homologues, because 20,000 is the maximum number of hits returned by an automated, remote BlastP search. In all of these searches, there had to be overlap within a region defined as the \u201cpeptidase unit\u201d, the (usually) single domain that carries the active site residues and/or the metal ligands, and the sequence relationship must have been at an E-value of 0.01 or less. If the active site residues (and/or metal ligands for metallopeptidase) were not all conserved, then the sequence was considered a \u201cnon-peptidase homologue\u201d. The results presented in this paper were derived from numerous searches conducted regularly since 1992, the last of which were BlastP searches at NCBI using type example sequences in April 2018.",

Many of these phyla are described as \u201ccandidate\u201d, derived mostly from metagenomics projects and environmental samples in which genomes have been assembled for organisms that have not been observed or otherwise studied. The completeness of such genomes must be questioned, because although it is possible to assemble a single chromosome, this would not represent the entirety of genetic material for most organisms. Eukaryotes and some bacteria contain more than one chromosome, and many organisms have organelles or plasmids that have their own genomes; and it is challenging to combine any of these to obtain the full genome of any organism that has not been isolated and studied. Supplementary Table 2 also shows the number of species per phylum where the genome has been completely sequenced, and the average number of peptidase homologues per genome. It might be assumed that the more complex the organism, the more peptidase genes its genome will encode, but as can be seen from the table, a sponge (Porifera) or an acorn worm (Hemichordata) has more peptidase homologues than a chordate. The numbers of proteins (and therefore peptidases) in a genome will depend upon the automated methods used to identify genes and the mRNAs they encode, and also upon the genome assembly. Chordate chromosomes can be rich in regions of tandem copies of genes; such regions can be difficult to assemble correctly, and individual genes difficult to identify, leading to an underestimation of the number. Some predicted proteomes are apparently rich in differently transcribed isoforms, even though there may be no evidence for their existence, and because the analyses performed here is comparison of protein sequences, isoforms will be seen as unique proteins. This inflates the number of protein genes in a genome. For model organisms, such as human, these peptidase homologues are merged following manual curation so that the number of homologues represents the number of genes, but this is time consuming and so far has not been automated. For organisms where individual strains that had their genomes sequenced, the number of protein-coding genes may again be inflated because of the presence of different plasmids. The organism that apparently has the most peptidase homologues is Bacillus cereus with 4,569, but many strains have been sequenced. This is also true of Escherichia coli (3,005 peptidase homologues), Pseudomonas fluorescens (1,979), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1,726). Polyploidy also affects the number of protein coding genes, particularly in cultivated plants such as rice (2,292), grape (1,746), and soya (1,653). All of these organisms apparently have more peptidase homologues than human (1,599).",

Hence there are many families of peptidases from viruses, and many families are known to share structural relationships indicating that many are related to one another even if this relationship is not detectable from comparison of the peptidase sequences alone. In most cases, a family of viral peptidases frequently contains only one family of viruses. Peptidase family S39 is an exception and contains sequences from four families of viruses. Viruses are not classified into taxa higher than order, but are known to have genomes that are single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). A virus with ssRNA encodes at least one polyprotein, which may contain peptidases within it required to cleave the polyprotein into individual proteins. A virus with dsDNA encodes several genes for individual proteins, one or more of which may be a peptidase required to activate one or more of the proteins that is synthesized as a precursor.",

An isoform of cathepsin L has been found in the nucleus [20], whereas other isoforms are found in the lysosome, an acidic organelle.

The nature of dihydroorotase, which in some eukaryotes is derived from a fusion of genes encoding four different enzymatic components of the pyrimidine pathway (glutamine amidotransferase, carbamoyl phosphate synthase, aspartate carbamoyltransferase and dihydroorotase) [24], has been used as a criterion for classifying eukaryotes into Bikonta (plants and chromists) and Unikonta (animals, fungi and some single-celled organisms) [25]. The glutamine amidotransferase domain is classified separately in MEROPS as a homologue in peptidase family C26.",

On the assumption that homologues in peptidase families present in LUCA performed similar functions to modern proteins, then it is clear that LUCA was able to synthesize intracellular (processed by methionyl aminopeptidase) and secreted proteins (processed by signal peptidase). LUCA was able to obtain the amino acid raw materials for protein synthesis by both intracellular (peptidases from families C56, M3, M16, M48, S1, S8, S9, S16, S54 and T1) and extracellular proteolysis (peptidases from M1 and M20). LUCA had membrane-associated proteins, including multipass proteins (such as signal peptidase and peptidases from M48 and S54), type II membrane proteins (family M1) and proteins attached to the membrane via C-terminal lipid groups (as shown by the presence of peptidases from M48 and M79). LUCA also had a cell wall, because homologues from S12 process the precursors of the cell-wall cross-linking peptide. The presence of an S41 homologue suggests that LUCA was able to degrade abnormal proteins [27]. Bacterial peptidases in S1 and M48 are stimulated by heat-shock and degrade abnormal proteins [28,29], suggesting that LUCA may have had a heat-shock response.",

There are three current theories: (1) that viruses, like parasites, are degenerate derived from single-celled organisms that have lost many genes that are unrequired for a viral life style; (2) that viruses are derived from retrotransposons and plasmids; (3) that virus-like organisms containing nucleic acids and proteins represent the oldest forms of life [30]. The existence of giant viruses such as Mimivirus, pathogens of Amoeba, give some credence to the first hypothesis [31] and Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus includes peptidases from families C1 (papain), C19 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14), C48 (Ulp1 peptidase), C89 (acid ceramidase precursor), M13 (neprilysin), M16 (pitrilysin), N10 (intein-containing replicative DNA helicase precursor) and S16 (Lon-A peptidase).

The similarity of polyproteins from ssRNA viruses and retrotransposons from eukaryotes (including the polyprotein processing peptidase from family A2) and lantiobiotic ABC transporter proteins (family C39) from viruses (e.g. bacteriophage SPBc2) to plasmids (e.g. plasmid p03 from Bacillus cereus) give credence to the second hypothesis. However, it is equally possible that retrotransposons are derived from ssRNA viruses and that plasmids are derived from dsDNA viruses.",

In addition, the number of proteasome components (peptidase family T1) approaches that of eukaryotes, rather than just the two homologues found in species from most other archaean phyla [8].

It is now thought that the mitochondrion was derived from a Rickettsia-like bacterium [46], and the plastid from a cyanobacterium [47]. Previously, it had been thought that some protozoa, known as Archezoa, were derived from a eukaryote ancestor from before the origin or these organelles [48], however determination of the genome sequences has shown that this is not the case and archezoans have genes for mitochondrial proteins but have lost their mitochondria [49]. Therefore, the only evidence that a family of proteins has originated from a gene transfer from a proto-organelle to a eukaryote nucleus is the presence of homologues in bacteria and eukaryotes and absence from archaea. However, this hypothesis is undermined if no homologues are known from rickettsias or cyanobacteria.",

For the transfer to have been from a bacterium to an animal means it happened to an ancestral metazoan and the mechanism is obscure; for the transfer to have been the other way around, implies frequent and recent gene sharing amongst bacteria. Family M49 (dipeptidyl-peptidase III) is found in animals; fungi; single-celled organisms such as Dictyostelium, Leishmania (but not the closely related Trypanosoma), Paramecium, Tetrahymena, Giardia and Entamoeba; and bacteria mostly from the phylum Bacteriodetes (including the characterized dipeptidyl-peptidase IIIB from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a component of the human intestinal flora) [53]. The homologues in bacteria are probably derived from horizontal gene transfers. The distribution in single-celled organisms that includes bikonts (Paramecium and Tetrahymena) as well as unikonts implies an origin in very early eukaryotes (and subsequent loss in plants).

The eukaryote distribution, with homologues from all three major divisions (Bikonta, Unikonta and Excavata), implies either several horizontal gene transfers or multiple gene losses.

Although family G1 (scytalidoglutamic peptidase) homologues are found in bacteria from six different phyla, the distribution amongst species with completed genomes in sparse, more indicative of horizontal gene transfers, and the origin of the family also appears to be in fungi. Family S64 (Ssy5 peptidase) is found only from members of Ascomycota and probably had its origin in the ancestor of that phylum. Ssy5 activates a signalling pathway in response to and for the uptake of extracellular amino acids [58]. Homologues of family C100 (agglutinin peptidase, which actives a nematocide [59]) are found, excluding contaminants, in species of Basidiomycota, and the family probably had its origin in the ancestor of that phylum. Although most family M36 (fungalysin, a virulence factor) homologues are from fungi (527), there is a considerable number from bacteria (237) classified into ten phyla: too many to be contaminants. It seems much more likely that an ancient horizontal gene transfer occurred, probably from a fungus to a bacterium. Most homologues from M35 (penicillolysin) are from species of Ascomycota, but with a considerable number of homologues from Proteobacteria, including the characterized EcpA peptidase from Xanthomonas oryzae and Aeromonas species, and numerous uncharacterized homologues from the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica. The non-fungal homologues are assumed to be derived from horizontal gene transfers from a fungus. Again, most N9 (intein-containing V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A) homologues are from Ascomycota, but there are also homologues from bacteria and dsDNA viruses, presumably the result of horizontal gene transfers.",
