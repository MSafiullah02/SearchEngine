However, most patients who are infected at peripheral sites with neurotropic viruses never develop evidence of CNS infection [3]. Since neuroinvasion occurs in only a small minority of infected patients, it is thought that host\u2013pathogen interactions and immune system responses in peripheral organs and at the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) prevent viruses from gaining access to and establishing infection within the CNS.",

In 1909, Goldmann theorized the existence of a structural barrier in the brain because intravenously injected trypan blue dye failed to enter the CNS [5]. It was not until the mid-20th century when electron microscopy studies revealed the ultrastructural characteristics that define the BBB [6, 7]. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) line post-capillary venules and function as the primary structural component of the BBB. BMECs closely associate with the foot processes of astrocytes, which secrete soluble factors that promote tight junctions and barrier integrity, pericytes, which regulate angiogenesis, vessel integrity, and blood flow, and microglia, which release cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in response to pathogen-associated stimuli [8, 9, 10]. Cytokines and other inflammatory mediators secreted by these supporting cells regulate tight junctions composition and the opening and closing of the BBB (see below).",

Colocalization of tight and adherens junction proteins is evaluated by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and barrier integrity is quantitated by measuring trans-endothelial electrical resistance or transit of virus/solutes across a BMEC monolayer [11, 12\u2022\u2022]. In vivo assessment of BBB integrity primarily relies on the measurement of dye (e.g., fluorescein) or protein (e.g., immunoglobulin) permeation into the CNS [13\u2022\u2022].",

Viruses invade the CNS by either directly crossing the BBB or by circumventing the BBB via non-hematogenous routes of entry [15]. Pathways of direct viral transit across the BBB include: (1) spread of viruses across BMEC tight junctions due to high levels of viremia and inflammation [12\u2022\u2022]; (2) direct infection of BMECs and transport of nascently generated viruses across basolateral membranes [16]; and (3) a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 pathway in which infected leukocytes in the blood migrate across the BBB to seed the CNS with infectious virus [17, 18]. This can occur in the context of inflammation-directed diapedesis or as part of tissue surveillance, which occurs at low levels at baseline. Some viruses can circumvent the BBB entirely by utilizing non-hematogenous routes of entry into the CNS. These mechanisms include: (1) retrograde axonal transport of virions from peripheral nerves into the CNS [19] and (2) infection of the olfactory epithelium followed by transit of virus into the CNS across the cribriform plate and infection of cells in the olfactory bulb [20]. When considered together, these five pathways of entry into the CNS are not mutually exclusive and may vary depending on the immune context or specific virus. It is plausible that more than one pathway may be used by certain viruses. For example, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus can invade the CNS via the cribriform plate, which subsequently triggers a delayed opening of the BBB that allows a second wave of viral neuroinvasion directly across the BBB [20].",

Vulnerability of young mice to neurotropic viruses may occur in part as a result of BBB breakdown during viral infection, which has been demonstrated by intravenous injection of dye and measurement of permeation into the CNS [12\u2022\u2022]. This phenomenon is not limited to animal models, since human neonates and children also are more susceptible to many forms of viral encephalitis [1]. Age-dependent effects on viral neuroinvasion can also be seen in the context of viruses that are not classically considered neurotropic. For example, old world alphaviruses including chikungunya virus (CHIKV) typically cause inflammatory arthritis and only rarely cause neurological disease in adults. In the 2006 epidemic of CHIKV on La Reunion Island, there were multiple cases of neuroinvasive CHIKV infection in neonates, which resulted in microcephaly, flaccid paralysis, cerebral palsy, seizure disorders, and even death [22, 23, 24, 25]. Some have speculated that young animals have an immature BBB despite the fact that tight junctions and other relevant structural components observed in adult animals are present early in development [26, 27]. Young animals may be more vulnerable to viral encephalitis as a result of a combination of host factors, with BBB breakdown being just one of the variables.",

Recent studies have shown that activation of viral RNA-sensing pathways in BMECs leads to Rac-1-dependent tight junction formation and enhanced BBB integrity to prevent viruses from transiting across BMEC monolayers [12\u2022\u2022]. The discovery that type I IFNs promote BBB integrity may explain, in part, the efficacy of IFN-\u03b2 in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease characterized by BBB breakdown and unchecked migration of autoreactive T cells into the brain and spinal cord. IFN-\u03bb, a type III IFN, also stabilizes tight junctions and limits viral crossing into the CNS of mice infected with flaviviruses. Animals lacking the IFN-\u03bb receptor (IFNLR1/IL10\u03b2) exhibited earlier entry of West Nile virus (WNV) into the brain despite similar levels of viral replication in peripheral organs compared to wild-type animals, and treatment of WNV-infected mice with pegylated IFN-\u03bb protected animals against virus neuroinvasion and lethality [13\u2022\u2022]. Type I and type III IFNs exert their barrier-tightening effects in BMECs through independent receptors but via a common non-canonical STAT1-independent signaling pathway that requires Rac1 activation and actin cytoskeletal reorganization [12\u2022\u2022, 13\u2022\u2022].",

All three TAM receptors contribute to BBB integrity in the context of different pathological conditions, with Tyro3 and Mertk having the most prominent effects. Mice lacking Mertk exhibit enhanced BBB permeability during infection with two unrelated encephalitic viruses, WNV and La Crosse encephalitis virus [30\u2022]. Tyro3 signaling promoted BBB integrity in the context of cerebral vascular occlusion [31], whereas signaling via Mertk on endothelial cells and possibly microglia was more important during viral infection [30\u2022]. Cooperative signaling via Mertk and the type I IFN receptor rapidly enhanced BMEC barrier integrity, suggesting that circulating TAM receptor ligands (Gas6 and Protein S) can amplify the barrier-stabilizing effects of type I IFN at the BBB.",

Treatment of BMECs with TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 activated the RhoA kinase pathway, which disrupted tight junctions and enhanced permeability of BMEC monolayers in vitro. Consistent with a role for pro-inflammatory cytokines in causing BBB breakdown, mice lacking toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) exhibited diminished cytokine (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) production systemically and enhanced BBB integrity during WNV infection, which partially protected mice from lethal WNV infection. TNF-\u03b1 produced during infection of BMECs also up-regulated expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, which facilitate leukocyte adhesion to BMECs and coincided with diminished TEER values measured across BMEC monolayers using an in vitro model of the BBB [33]. Thus, pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in BMECs during viral infection can enhance leukocyte recruitment as well as promote BBB breakdown.",

For example, in a co-culture system of pericytes with BMECs, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection of pericytes triggered secretion of IL-6, which resulted in degradation of ZO-1 in BMECs and endothelial barrier disruption [38\u2022]. WNV infection of astrocytes in vitro resulted in production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) that degrade tight junctions and promote BBB breakdown [39]. The relevance of MMPs during WNV infection is supported by the observation that degradation of tight junction proteins correlated with expression of MMPs in vivo [40]. The contribution of MMP9 in WNV neuroinvasion was established by the discovery that MMP9\u2212/\u2212 mice were resistant to WNV infection [41]. In addition to the release of MMPs that degrade tight junctions, astrocytes also produce cytokines that contribute to BBB breakdown. For example, JEV infection of astrocytes triggered release of IL-6 and VEGF, which alter endothelial cell junctions by causing proteasomal degradation of ZO-1 [42\u2022]. Consistent with these in vitro data using mouse models, JEV infection in non-human primates causes activation of astrocytes, pericytes, and BMECs [43], all of which may contribute to the BBB breakdown that is seen clinically.",

Remarkably, colonization of germ-free mice with only C. tyrobutyricum was sufficient to restore BBB integrity [44\u2022\u2022], although this finding does not exclude a role for other gastrointestinal commensals in regulating BBB integrity.
