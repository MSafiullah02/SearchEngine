Urgent reallocation of resources is often possible with improved regional awareness, for instance, when ventilators are scarce in one facility but available in another. Another regional consideration is blood supply. Currently, our region's blood supply is at 60% of normal given blood drive event cancelations and regional stay-at-home orders. Scoring the severity of illness across conditions, although an imperfect system, allows for proper allocation of resources and most importantly upholds the principle of distributive justice in an overwhelmed healthcare system. In the meantime, our burn center is reducing the needs for daily dressing changes for inpatients, through silver-impregnated dressings and ointment reapplications on greasy gauze. Updated protocols are already in place for procedures that generate aerosolized particles (airway procedures, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, bronchoscopy).
