Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is undermining this sense of security because it is proving both highly transmissible (like H1N1) and not too deadly (unlike Ebola). The result is a relatively easily transmitted virus with a case fatality rate currently estimated as well above that of the seasonal influenza. With its high transmissibility and rapid global circulation, COVID-19 is being compared with the deadly Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.1\n",

However, fomites have also proven important during other outbreaks. As with SARS, during MERS 2015 there were numerous examples of HCWs contracting the virus even when fully gowned and often despite having had no direct contact with carriers.6 For example, during the Korean MERS outbreak, one super-spreader infected 82 people in a medical center. Initial analyses pointed to transmission by the index case via droplets and contact with exposed people in the same care zone. However, later analysis found that those without contact history with the index case were likely infected by fomites on bed curtains and/or public restroom fixtures touched by the index case who had been suffering from walking pneumonia and diarrhea.9 Similar findings were identified regarding interactions of fomite-related nosocomial and community transmissions during H1N1 2009 and Ebola 2014.4, 5, 6\n",
