Initially, HCoV-NL635 and HCoV-HKU1,6 were reported causing acute respiratory diseases of lower severity compared to the SARS-CoV and more recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) causing lethal respiratory diseases.7, 8 To date, there are no approved antiviral drugs or vaccines available for the prevention and/or treatment of SARS-like viruses making the development of effective antiviral agents an imperative need.9\n",

            "text": "The catalytic activity of 3CLpro has been well characterized, with extensive details regarding the structure of this enzyme and the corresponding catalytic site. In this respect, it is known that the active site is located within domains I and II, in which a catalytic dyad consisting of residues Cys145 and His41 is located.11 It has also been previously reported that the catalytic site of 3CLpro exhibits a stereoselective recognition of non-covalent inhibitors.18 In this context, our molecular modeling protocols initiated with the exploration of the binding mode, intermolecular interaction pattern and stereoselectivity of the non-covalent inhibitor of 3CLpro deposited in the Protein Databank under the code 3V3M. Both enantiomers of the bound ligand were docked within the catalytic site, and as can be seen in Fig S1a,b, the R enantiomer resulted in an identical interaction pattern to that observed in the experimentally obtained crystal. The ligand binding is stabilized by several hydrophobic and hydrogen bond (HB) interaction, of which those with Glu166, His163 and Gly143 are of particular relevance. Noteworthy, the S enantiomer was also able to establish several hydrophobic interactions, but was not able to establish HB with Glu166 and His163. Taking into account that it has been previously reported that only the R enantiomer is active,18 this finding suggests that the establishment of interactions with Glu166 and His163 constitutes a critical feature to inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme. To further study the persistence of these HB interactions, the intermolecular complexes were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) analysis, with Table S1 presenting the persistence value (%) for each HB as calculated from the MD trajectories. As can be seen in Table S1, entry 1, the R enantiomer was able to maintain in relatively high frequencies the HB interactions with Glu166, His163 and Gly143, while the S enantiomer rearranged its binding to contact only Glu166 (60% persistence). Our findings not only validate the molecular modeling workflow we developed (i.e. the crystallographic binding pose was reproduced), but also strongly suggests that at least two stable electrostatic interactions within the active site are required for effective 3CLpro inhibition.21\n",

            "text": "To further study this hypothesis, a set of 12 previously reported 3CLpro inhibitors containing a fused 1,2,3 triazole ring and exhibiting a wide range of inhibitory activities (i.e. between 51 and 26000 nM, Tables S3 and S5), was subjected to our molecular modeling workflow. The lowest energy binding mode obtained for TS8 was in agreement with the reported crystallographic structure (Fig. S3d and pdb code 4MDS, respectively), further supporting an adequate parametrization and simulation conditions of the molecular modeling protocol. From inspection of the corresponding lowest energy docked poses for the whole set of compounds (Figs. S2\u2013S4), we observed that all these inhibitors were indeed able to establish the two HB previously described for 3V3M, i.e. one with the backbone of Glu166 and another one with the side chain of His163. In these binding modes, the triazole ring is positioned in the proximity of the catalytic dyad. From the MD simulations and the quantification of the persistence of the above mentioned hydrogen bond interactions (Table S1, entries 3\u201314), we observed that all the compounds maintained the hydrogen bonds required for the inhibition of 3CLpro in high frequencies, and in particular that with Glu166. It is noteworthy that inhibitors that are enantiomerically pure and exhibiting submicromolar activities maintained high frequencies of HB with Glu166 and His163. In particular, TS-1, which is by far the most potent compound within the training set, exhibited also a single cluster of docked poses, suggesting not only an efficient pharmacodynamic interaction with 3CLpro, but also an adequate conformational preorganization that is compliant with the corresponding bioactive conformation.",

Figs. S5 and S9 shows the lowest energy binding modes to 3CLpro found for compounds 14a\u2013r. When the docked poses corresponding to the bioactive derivatives are observed (i.e. 14d and 14n, Figs. S5d, S8b, respectively), it can be seen that they establish the two HB interactions with Glu166 and His163, positioning also the triazole ring in the proximities of the catalytic dyad. As it was discussed in previous sections, this interaction pattern is required for the inhibition of 3CLpro catalytic activity, suggesting that this enzyme may be the antiviral target of these fused 1,2,3-triazoles. Further analysis by MD also showed that these interactions are maintained throughout the simulation, further supporting their bioactivities (Table S2, entries 4, 14 and 17). In contrast, the fused triazole derivatives that did not exhibited antiviral activities in infected cells, did not establish these two HB interactions in the lowest energy binding pose, or were not able to form them during the simulation trajectory when subjected to MD assays. Compounds 14c and 14m constitute two exceptions to this behavior, both of them bearing a methoxy substituent on the para position of the phenyl ring substituting the triazole central scaffold. These two compounds were able to establish and maintain the HB interaction pattern required for 3CLpro inhibition, (Table S2, entries 3 and 13) but did not exhibit antiviral activity. This fact may be due to a disfavorable entropic contribution upon binding to the 3CLpro catalytic site, since in order to maintain the interaction with His163, the rotation of the methoxy group is constrained within a dihedral angle of 10 \u00c5. Clearly, this entropic cost is not present for the bioactive analogue bearing a fluorine atom in the para position (14d).",

Regarding the interaction of 18i, this compound establishes stable HB contacts with both Glu166 and His163, while further anchoring to residue Gln189. As a result, both compounds positioned the fused triazole scaffold in the vicinity of the catalytic dyad which is consistent with blocking the protease activity of the enzyme. Finally, when the interaction patterns of the inactive compounds within the series 18a\u2013l were analyzed, we found that all of them failed to establish the two required HB interactions within the catalytic site of the enzyme.",

Compounds 14d, 14n, 14q, 18f and 18i showed moderate activity against coronavirus 229E. A molecular modeling work flow was developed based on previously reported 3CLpro non-covalent inhibitors and helped the identification of key molecular interactions. Application of this model to our library, supports that the antiviral activity is mediated through the inhibition of 3CLpro. Additional studies on the structure-activity relationship will enable us to prepare new fused 1,2,3-triazole derivatives with enhanced antiviral properties.",
