            "text": "In the decades prior to 2014, human outbreaks of emerging zoonotic viruses causing fatal hemorrhagic fever, such as Ebola virus (EBOV), or encephalitis, such as Nipah virus (NiV), have been relatively sporadic and small in terms of case numbers, ranging from isolated single cases to several hundred cases (CDC, 2017, Luby and Gurley, 2012). The historically largest EBOV outbreak of 2013\u20132016 highlighted the relative paucity of efficacious therapeutics and vaccines available to deploy against such pathogens, despite extensive pre-clinical studies demonstrating efficacy of therapeutic antibodies and vaccines for these biosafety level-4 pathogens (Broder et al., 2016, Geisbert et al., 2014, Mendoza et al., 2017, Mire et al., 2016, Qiu et al., 2014). To identify therapeutics that could be repurposed against EBOV, in vitro screens of libraries of FDA-approved compounds have been conducted, screening, among others, antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogs (Madrid et al., 2015, Veljkovic et al., 2015, Welch et al., 2016). Over the last 30 years, the development of antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogs was primarily directed towards combating viruses responsible for chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus, herpes viruses, and hepatitis viruses (Ray and Hitchcock, 2009). In 2006, Klumpp and colleagues first demonstrated the in vitro activity of 4\u2032-azidocytidine (4\u2032N3-C, R1479) against hepatitis C virus (HCV), a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus (Klumpp et al., 2006). The development of R1479 and its prodrug balapiravir was halted following findings of toxicity and low efficacy of these compounds in clinical trials for treating HCV and Dengue virus (Nelson et al., 2012, Nguyen et al., 2013). Despite this, the in vitro activity of R1479 against diverse flaviviruses of public health importance, such as Dengue virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus, suggested that it may be a template for developing modified analogs with antiviral activity (Chen et al., 2014, Eyer et al., 2016). Interestingly, R1479 and other 4\u2032-modified analogs have recently been shown to also inhibit respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus (Clarke et al., 2015, Deval et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015). Following those studies, we described potent antiviral activity of R1479 against representative members of the Paramyxoviridae family, including the henipaviruses, NiV and Hendra virus (HeV) (Hotard et al., 2017). Given the in vitro antiviral properties of R1479 and its 2\u2032-mono and 2\u2032-difluoro analogs (2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-C and 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C, respectively) against RSV (Deval et al., 2015), and the highly conserved nucleotide binding domains shared across Pneumoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Filoviridae families (Lo et al., 2017), we evaluated and compared the antiviral potencies of these cytidine analogs against representative paramyxoviruses and filoviruses including the 2014 Makona variant of EBOV (Albarino et al., 2015). Our study documents the susceptibility of paramyxoviruses and filoviruses to R1479 and its 2\u2032-fluoro-modified analogs, and reinforces the prospect of developing 4\u2032-modified nucleoside analogs as potential broad-spectrum therapeutics against RNA viruses of public health importance.",

The RSV polymerase forms a dimer of the L and P protein (RSV L-P) that accepts RNA templates with a primer to generate short RNA synthesis products (Fig. 1d) (Noton et al., 2012). RSV L-P extends the primer by 1 base with the addition of (\u03b1-33P)-GTP (Fig. 1e, lane 1) and fully it extends by 7 bases with the addition of ATP and CTP (Fig. 1e, lane 3). We individually substituted the 3 cytidine analogs in place of natural CTP to understand their potential effects as non-obligatory chain terminators in an RNA synthesis assay (Fig. 1e, lanes 4\u20136). R1479-TP, 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-CTP, and 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-CTP terminated RNA synthesis by RSV L-P at position +8, and were recognized almost equally by the enzyme.

To investigate whether this difference was due to cellular phosphorylation levels of R1479, we measured intracellular phosphorylation of R1479 in 4 human cell lines: HeLa, a cervical adenocarcinoma line; Huh7, a hepatoma line; SK-N-MC, a neuroepithelioma line; and NCI-H358. Each cell line was treated with R1479 for 24 h, and intracellular triphosphate levels were then measured using tandem liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and quantitated using synthetic standards. Levels of the corresponding triphosphate (R1479-TP) were measured in each of the 4 cell lines, with highest R1479-TP levels seen in NCI-H358 cells (391 \u00b1 72 pmol/million cells; Fig. 2\na). Phosphorylation of R1479 was lowest in Huh7 cells and SK-N-MC cells (18 \u00b1 0.6 and 42 \u00b1 10 pmol/million cells, respectively), and intermediate in HeLa cells (136 \u00b1 21 pmol/million cells). In addition to R1479, which contains a 4\u2032-azido substitution, we examined the effects of 2\u2032-monofluoro or 2\u2032-difluoro substitutions on NTP levels using the 2 cell lines with the highest NTP levels. HeLa and NCI-H358 cells were treated with 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-C and 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C for 24 h at 50 \u03bcM, and NTP formation was measured and quantified as previously described (Fig. 2b). In both cell lines, 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C levels were highest, followed by R1479 and then 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-C, but higher overall NTP levels of all 3 nucleosides were seen in NCI-H358 cells.

R1479 and 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C inhibited both EBOV variants similarly to henipaviruses, with approximate EC50 values of 2 \u03bcM and 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 1).

Using our FFU assay, we observed that R1479 inhibited RAVV with 3-fold lower potency than EBOV or SUDV, with an EC50 value of 7.4 \u03bcM (Fig. 8\na, Table 1). 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C and 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-C, however, inhibited RAVV similarly to EBOV and SUDV, with EC50 values of 0.73 \u03bcM and 10.8 \u03bcM, respectively. We then measured infectious RAVV production in the presence of the 3 compounds. Similar to what we observed for SUDV, both R1479 and 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C reduced infectious RAVV titers by over 4 orders of magnitude at concentrations of 50 \u03bcM and 6.25 \u03bcM, respectively, with respective EC50 values of 3 \u03bcM (R1479) and 0.16 \u03bcM (2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C; Fig. 8b, Table 1). 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-C reduced RAVV titers by roughly 1.5 orders of magnitude at the highest concentration used (25 \u03bcM), with an EC50 value of 6 \u03bcM (Fig. 8b, Table 1).",

            "text": "In this study, we characterized the antiviral properties of R1479 and its analogs 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-C and 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C using both cell-free and cell-based assays. Despite the presence of 3\u2032-OH group in each analog, all 3 compounds behaved like conventional non-obligatory RNA synthesis chain terminators in cell-free RSV polymerase assays (Deval et al., 2015). In order for nucleoside analogs to retain their antiviral function inside a cell, multiple cellular kinases are required to convert them to the active triphosphate form (Ray and Hitchcock, 2009). To better understand the cell type-dependent variability we previously observed with R1479 antiviral activity (Hotard et al., 2017), we measured cellular levels of R1479-TP in 4 different cell lines, and observed 2 to 3-fold higher levels of R1479-TP, 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-CTP, and 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-CTP in NCI-H358 cells than in HeLa cells. The comparatively elevated NTP levels observed in NCI-H358 cells may be attributed to higher expression levels of uridine-cytidine kinases, which catalyze the presumed initial rate-limiting step of phosphorylating uridine and cytidine nucleosides (Van Rompay et al., 2001). Characterizing the NCI-H358 cell line as the optimal line to use in this study highlights the importance of confirming cellular triphosphate levels when conducting antiviral screens of nucleoside analog libraries. We have observed significantly decreased antiviral activity for R1479, 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-C, and 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C in Huh7 cells against reporter EBOVs (data not shown), which is likely explained by overall lower phosphorylation levels of these cytidine analogs in this cell line (Fig. 2a). The higher potency of 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-C, and 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C over R1479 against paramyxoviruses, however, cannot solely be attributed to NTP levels, since R1479-TP levels were higher than 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-CTP levels in these cells (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the change in rank order of anti-filoviral potency in the cell-based assays suggests that the differences in antiviral activity are due to differential recognition, or discrimination, of these NTP analogs by viral polymerases. Our gel-based biochemical assay using RSV polymerase provides qualitative results and informs mainly on the mechanism of action of each compound, demonstrating substrate recognition and chain termination (Fig. 1). It does not provide enough information to rank order potencies and/or discrimination between the three nucleotides (Deval et al., 2015). Evaluation of these compounds in primary human SAECs confirmed the potent anti-NiV activity of 2\u2032F-4\u2032N3-C (Fig. 9) and the anti-MARV activity of 2\u2032diF-4\u2032N3-C (Fig. 10). Our study did not include two other related nucleosides 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro-4\u2032-azidocytidine (RO-0622) and 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-\u03b2-hydroxy-4\u2032-azidocytidine (RO-9187) (Klumpp et al., 2008) because they had little to no antiviral activity against both NiV and EBOV, respectively (data not shown). Our results warrant further studies comparing the antiviral potency of these NTP analogs against recombinant paramyxovirus and filovirus polymerases, although technical challenges have precluded such work only until very recently (Jordan et al., 2018). The ability of these cytidine analogs to reduce henipavirus and filovirus infectious yields by over 4 log TCID50/mL mirrors viral inhibition by GS-441524 (a 1\u2032-cyano-modified adenosine analog) and its phosphoramidate nucleotide prodrug GS-5734 (Lo et al., 2017). GS-5734 inhibited filoviruses and coronaviruses in non-human primate and mouse models, respectively, and is currently in phase 2 clinical trials for treatment of EBOV disease (EVD) (Sheahan et al., 2017, Warren et al., 2016). Favipiravir, also known at T-705, is a broad-spectrum small molecule nucleoside precursor originally developed to treat influenza A virus; it also decreased EBOV infectious yield by 4 logTCID50/mL, albeit at high concentrations (1000 \u03bcM) by a yet-undefined mechanism (Baranovich et al., 2013, Oestereich et al., 2014). BCX4430 is an adenosine nucleoside analog with variable in vitro broad-spectrum activity across 8 virus families including Filoviridae, and is currently in phase 1 clinical trials for treating EVD (Taylor et al., 2016, Warren et al., 2014). Although BCX4430 inhibits HCV polymerase similarly to conventional chain terminators and also reduces infectious filovirus yield, its mechanism of action against negative-strand viruses is unclear. While neither R1479 nor its 2\u2032-fluoro-modified analogs are viable candidates for antiviral therapeutics due to variable incorporation by host mitochondrial RNA and DNA polymerases (Arnold et al., 2012, Clarke et al., 2015), they provide an initial comparison of filo- and paramyxovirus susceptibility to 4\u2032-modified nucleosides. Our study provides evidence supporting the development of 4\u2032-modified nucleosides with near-equivalent potency not only against 3 Mononegavirales order families, but also against the positive-sense Flaviviridae family. Developing a small-molecule, broad-spectrum therapeutic to treat phylogenetically divergent viral infections that share significant epidemiological and clinical overlap (e.g., EBOV and yellow fever virus; NiV and Japanese encephalitis virus) would benefit clinicians with no access to rapid diagnostics amidst an outbreak of these serious viral infections.",
