In the control sheep without H. contortus infection, the abomasal microbiota were dominated by the following bacterial classes: Alteromonadales (35.5%), Pseudomonadales (29.5%), Bacteroidales (10.4%), Clostridiales (9.8%), Flavobacteriales (3.4%), Enterobacteriales (1.9%), Bacillales (1.3%), and Aeromonadales (1.0%) (Fig. 1a). H. contortus infection induced dramatic changes in microbial abundance, including those of Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, Sphingobacteriales, Enterobacteriales, Bacillales, and Coriobacteriales, compared to the uninfected group (Fig. 1a). Of particular interest were the Bacillales bacteria that had probiotic effects in relation to H. contortus infection. The relative abundance of Bacillales was significantly reduced upon H. contortus infection (Fig. 1b and c) (P < 0.005). It was further shown by linear effect size (LEfSe) analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences that Bacillales was the main contributor as a probiotic in the abomasal microbiota to protect sheep from H. contortus infection (Fig. 1d). Together, these data demonstrated that sheep with H. contortus infection have significant reductions in Bacillales levels in the abomasum, suggesting a potential protective role of these probiotic bacteria in against nematodes and possibly other pathogenic infection.",

Flow cytometry assay further confirmed that 86.01% of the rBSCotB-HcG spores expressed CotB-HcGAPDH 72 h after induction (Fig. 3b). No differences between wild-type (WT) and rBSCotB-HcG strains were observed in the production and germination of spores (Fig. 3c). rBSCotB-HcG spores were further examined to determine whether expression of CotB-HcGAPDH affected spore structure by both scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Again, no change was observed in the coat folds of elliptical spore morphology related to the wild type (Fig. 3d). The exine and intine structures of rBSCotB-HcG were similar to those of the wild-type strain (Fig. 3e). These results indicate that expression of the CotB-HcGAPDH fusion protein did not change the production and structure of B. subtilis spores.",

Lymphocytes prepared from the murine spleens were cultured and stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or the purified HcGAPDH protein to determine the specific cell-mediated immune responses. Higher levels of lymphocyte proliferation were observed in rBSCotB-HcG-treated mice than in control mice receiving ConA or LPS stimulation (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4b). Similar results were obtained when the purified HcGAPDH protein was used as a stimulator (P < 0.05). Further, the anti-HcGAPDH immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in these murine sera were measured. The highest antibody level was detected in mice given rBSCotB-HcG (P < 0.005) at week 3 (Fig. 4c). No anti-HcGAPDH antibody was detected in mice receiving PBS or the WT or rBSCotB strain (P > 0.05). The anti-HcGAPDH IgG2a level was 2.07 times higher than that of anti-HcGAPDH IgG1 (P < 0.005), indicating a Th1-dominated T cell immune response (Fig. 4d). We next determined the levels of the secretory IgA (sIgA) to HcGAPDH in the intestinal epithelial cells and plasma cells. These were significantly higher in rBSCotB-HcG mice than in controls (P < 0.01) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Genes representing Th1 activation, such as gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12, and T-bet, and those of Th2 activation, such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and GATA-3, in the splenic lymphocytes were significantly induced by rBSCotB-HcG administration in comparison to controls (Fig. 4e), suggesting that rBSCotB-HcG stimulated mixed Th1/Th2 immune responses.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from sheep were isolated on day 7 after infection, which is the time required for the infective L3 (iL3) of H. contortus to develop to the blood-sucking L4 stage in the abomasum. These cells were cultured and stimulated with ConA, LPS, or purified HcGAPDH protein. Consistent with the murine results, the proliferation of PBLs from the sheep receiving Hc+rBSCotB-HcG in the presence of ConA or LPS was significantly greater than that from the Hc group (P < 0.005) (Fig. 5b). The purified HcGAPDH protein also stimulated significant proliferation of PBLs from these sheep in comparison to control sheep (P < 0.005). The administration of rBSCotB-HcG induced anti-HcGAPDH IgG production (P < 0.005, compared to the Ctrl) at week 2, and the IgG level plateaued at week 4 until week 8 (Fig. 5c). Meanwhile, anti-HcGAPDH IgG was not detectable in the control sheep. Further, anti-HcGAPDH sIgA levels were significantly higher in the intestinal mucus of Hc+rBSCotB-HcG sheep than in that of the Hc sheep (P < 0.01) (Fig. S1). It was also found that genes representing Th1 activation (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\u03b1]) and those of Th2 activation (IL-4 and transforming growth factor \u03b2 [TGF-\u03b2]) in PBLs of Hc+rBSCotB-HcG sheep were highly activated (Fig. 5d), even though the expression of IL-6 and IL-10 did not change (P > 0.05).

The WT B. subtilis spores also showed some degree of protection against body weight loss caused by H. contortus infection. In this case, 27.7% more body weight was recorded in the sheep receiving the WT B. subtilis spores than to the infected sheep without it (Fig. 7a). Next, parasite load by egg per gram feces (EPG) and adult worm counting was determined. For sheep given 1010 CFU of rBSCotB-HcG/animal, followed by H. contortus infection, the EPG levels dropped by 71.5% (Fig. 7b), and the worm load dropped by an astonishing 84.1% compared to sheep infected with H. contortus alone (Fig. 7c and Table 1). We also evaluated the infection by examining the abomasum. The abomasal surfaces of infected sheep were covered with worms and tracks of parasite crawling. The numbers of worms and parasite crawling tracks in the Hc+rBSCotB-HcG sheep decreased compared to Hc group (Fig. 7d). Furthermore, the abomasal mucosas of infected sheep showed intensive infiltration by mononucleates in comparison to the uninfected sheep. No apparent infiltration was observed in Hc+rBSCotB-HcG sheep (Fig. 7e). These data indicate that rBSCotB-HcG offer effective protection of sheep from H. contortus infection by improving abomasal microbiota (Fig. 7f).",

Antibodies in the mucus are the first line of host\u2019s defense against various pathogens, including parasites, invading the mucosa (17\u201319) by inhibiting the motility and adherence of the pathogens (20). Both sIgA and IFN-\u03b3 have powerful bactericidal effects in early infection (21). However, whether oral administration is the best immunization strategy for H. contortus remains to be verified.

IL-12 is a key cytokine that induces Th1-type immune response (15). The transcription factor T-bet is a major regulator of Th1 cell polarization (23). Significant upregulation of IL-12 and T-bet gene expression induced by rBSCotB-HcG indicated that B. subtilis spores mainly elicited Th1-type immune responses in a murine model. Interestingly, our results also indicate that the administration of rBSCotB-HcG in sheep induced Th2-type immune responses besides Th1, as shown by the upregulation of cytokine IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2, implying that there may be mixed Th1/Th2 immune responses in sheep (24, 25). A plausible explanation for this is that such mixed immune responses are jointly activated by spores and HcGAPDH antigenic protein. Alternatively, rBSCotB-HcG by proteolytic cleavage releases soluble antigens, including HcGAPDH, following their uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which leads to presentation to a major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-restricted manner for the generation of Th2-type immune responses (26). IL-4 is a signal cytokine for the Th2 response and is mainly responsible for the IgE isotype switch (27). The immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 is responsible for the inhibition of Th2 immune responses (28, 29). In mice, a slight upregulation of cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) and Th2-type transcription factors (GATA-3) was found, suggesting that rBSCotB-HcG could induce Th1/Th2 mixed immune responses. TGF-\u03b2 manipulates various immune activities differentially in various cell types and potentially regulates a wide range of biological processes. In sheep, the mRNA levels of both TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2 of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood were increased. Some cytokines, particularly IFN-\u03b3 and TGF-\u03b2, have previously been proved to induce the upregulation of both MHC-I and MHC-II gene expression in different immune cells (30), which then stimulates the production of antibodies and immune responses against parasitic pathogens (30). Therefore, the upregulation of TGF-\u03b2 gene expression in sheep receiving rBSCotB-HcG suggested that spores presenting HcGAPDH protein activate the host immune responses against parasitic infections by stimulating both MHC-I and MHC-II antigen-presenting pathways. Our results are consistent with an early study using different recombinant spores (31).",

H. contortus infection leads to significant decrease in the abundance of Bacillales in the abomasal microbiota. A correlation of H. contortus infection with specific changes at the species or genus level of bacteria was not established in the present study. One plausible explanation is that sequencing-based approach is intended to detect taxonomic shifts at a level higher than the genus/species level. This is consistent with an earlier report (5). Bacillus spp. are widely used as probiotics in the livestock industry lately. Currently, a few European Union-approved products are available in the market. The most notable one is BioPlus2B from Christian Hansen (32). The probiotic B. subtilis emerges favorably as a vaccine carrier is because of its protective effects against a wide spectrum of pathogens (16, 33\u201335). In addition, its spores possess adjuvant property due to a combination of antigens and the spore surface (36, 37). Many Bacillus species are safe for sheep and can be used in sheep feeds (38). The present study unequivocally demonstrated that a recombinant B. subtilis, rBSCotB-HcG, offers great protection against H. contortus infection in sheep, a natural host of this devastating nematode for the sheep industry.",

Our working hypothesis (Fig. 8) is that rBSCotB-HcG activates T helper lymphocytes by APCs and stimulates increasing the release of IL-2 that synergistically activates B lymphocytes to transform them into plasma cells. The latter generates anti-HcGAPDH IgG antibodies. The spores also stimulate intestinal epithelial cells and plasma cells to produce anti-HcGAPDH sIgA, which facilitates the proliferation of eosinophils and the upregulation of TGF-\u03b2, resulting in parasite killing and clearance. HcGAPDH plays a key role in the inhibition of host complement activation. Antibody neutralization of HcGAPDH removes this inhibitor, leading to complement activation. Further, live H. contortus worms release HcGAPDH that is involved in evasion of the host immune system. Anti-HcGAPDH IgG and sIgA hence block the immune evasion of H. contortus.",
