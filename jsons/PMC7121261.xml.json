Although the great majority of cases are benign and self-limited, requiring no intervention, some patients need respiratory support. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is a critical intervention in many cases of acute respiratory failure (ARF), but there are absolute risks associated with endotracheal intubation (ETI). On the other hand, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is an extremely valuable alternative to IMV. A major reason for the increasing use of NIV has been the desire to avoid the complications of IMV. It is generally much safer than IMV and has been shown to decrease resource utilization. Its use also avoids the complications and side effects associated with ETI, including upper airway trauma, laryngeal swelling, postextubation vocal cord dysfunction, nosocomial infections, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. There are a number of advantages of NIV including leaving the upper airway intact, preserving the natural defense mechanisms of the upper airways, decreasing the need for sedation, maintaining the ability to talk while undergoing NIV, and reducing the length of hospitalization and its associated costs [1\u20133].",

It can be initiated wherever the patient presents with ARF\u2014in the PED, PICU, or other areas of the hospital. Over the last decade, several studies have suggested successful application of NIV in patients with ARF. Although numerous controlled studies and meta-analyses have shown its efficiency in different forms of ARF (e.g., exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema in adults), the evidence supporting its using in infants and children with ARF is still limited, and there are no generally accepted guidelines for its use. However, the most recent physiological and randomized studies indicate that the early application of NIV improves the breathing pattern and gas exchange and reduces respiratory muscle effort in children [1\u20137].",

In these circumstances, most of the studies showed that the use of NIV decreased the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia and reduced the duration of oxygen requirement without prolonging the hospital stay [4\u20138]. On the other hand, there is controversy about the possibility that NIV increases the spread of viral infections during pandemics. Moreover, since the outbreak of SARS in 2003, pandemic planners around the world have classified NIV as a high risk procedure that should be used cautiously because of possible spread of the infection [9]. Similarly, Ontario\u2019s Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee in Canada recommended that NIV be avoided for patients with febrile respiratory illness during the 2009 influenza pandemic (H1N1) [10]. Additionally, the World Health Organization\u2019s interim guidelines on the prevention and control of acute respiratory diseases associated with health care have included NIV among the aerosol-generating procedures in which there is possibly an increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission [11]. However, there has been no evidence-based information to support the claim that the use of NIV increases the risk of transmitting infectious diseases.",

One was occasioned by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is an emerging infectious disease that first manifested in humans in China in 2002. In an observational study of the SARS outbreak that included adult patients from China, the effectiveness of NIV in the treatment of ARF was investigated. It was shown that NIV was effective in preventing the use of endotracheal intubation in 70 % of patients because of its early initiation in the SARS patients. In this study, none of the health workers, including doctors, nurses, and health-care assistants, acquired SARS from the patients. As an explanation, NIV was applied in a negative-pressure environment with strict personal protection and close monitoring of the health status of all involved staff [4]. In another study from Toronto during SARS, the use of NIV was discouraged especially after clinicians contracted the disease when a patient was intubated following NIV failure [9]. Therefore, some clinicians considered NIV contraindicated for ARF due to airborne respiratory diseases unless it is used in a negative-pressure isolation room and strict precautions are taken [4, 9].",

The role of NIV in children with ARF due to influenza A(H1N1) was also the subject of controversy, although NIV has become an important mechanism for ventilator support for pediatric ARF. Severe respiratory failure is a well-recognized complication of pandemic H1N1 influenza infection. Rello et al. [16] applied NIV to a small number of critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1 infection complicated by ARF. Most of these patients subsequently required IMV support. Therefore, NIV is generally not recommended for patients with the novel influenza infection complicated by pneumonia and ARDS. NIV temporarily improves oxygenation and reduces the work of breathing but does not necessarily alter the course of the disease. The need for NIV is an indication of severe disease and likelihood of IMV. In addition, hemodynamic instability and multi-organ failure are contraindications for applying NIV [2, 16, 17].",

NIV was considered based on guidelines regarding ARF that included severe dyspnea at rest [respiration rate (RR) > 35/min], PaO2/FiO2 < 200 while breathing oxygen through a mask, and use of accessory muscles of respiration or paradoxical abdominal motion. Criteria for a response to NIV, or lack of it, were RR improvement, the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and blood gases improvement. Intubation was considered if there was intolerance to the mask or there was a contraindication to continued use, including nasal bridge necrosis, persistent hypoxemia not responding to appropriate and tolerated levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), or persistent or worsening respiratory acidosis. In all, 32.1 % of patients were managed with NIV. However 17 % of all patients failed NIV and were intubated and ventilated invasively. Patients who could be started on and managed with NIV had significantly better survival compared with those who required IMV at the onset. The need for invasive ventilation at admission was found to be associated with a higher mortality rate [18].",

Within this consensus, the failure rate of NIV in patients with ARF secondary to ARDS due to influenza virus A(H1N1) infection was 75 %, the mortality rate among the patients in which NIV failed was 38 %, and delays in starting intubation were associated to an increase mortality risk. The general recommendation was that early intubation of patients with evidence of NIV failure should be instituted for better results [21].",

[6], in a descriptive study, recommended that NIV be used as the first line intervention in children with severe ARF due to community-acquired pneumonia or respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients, although the failure rate in their study was 78 % among patients with ARDS. Munoz-Bonet et al. [5] reported an NIV success rate of 81 % regarding control of ARF due to pneumonia, thereby avoiding tracheal intubation and its complications. Two parameters were associated with NIV failure, including MAP > 11.5 cmH2O and the FiO2 (0.6). On the other hand, the NIV success rate was 50 % in patients with ARDS. Therefore, the authors thought that the diagnosis of ARDS should not be a contraindication for the use of NIV, especially in immunosuppressed patients because it prevents tracheal intubation They also recommended that NIV be applied as early as possible.",

They showed that the nurses and physicians who directly participated in endotracheal intubation had a dramatically increased risk of developing SARS. Similarly, nurses caring for patients undergoing NIV may have been more likely to develop SARS than nurses caring for patients with SARS treated with conventional ventilation. The difference, however, was not statistically significant. Their study indicated that tracheal suctioning was one of the certain high-risk components of SARS nursing care, but it was not generally performed in patients with SARS ventilated with NIV. Therefore, endotracheal suction might be considered not to increase the risk of respiratory droplet dispersion.",

Droplets in the respirable range (~5 \u03bcm) may play a significant part in transmission, but the role of aerosols has been questioned. There are few studies that have quantified the viral load in droplets or aerosols. A subgroup of patients, often with underlying chronic disorders or risk factors such as immunosuppression, can develop pneumonia/respiratory insufficiency with H1N1 swine flu or other influenzal infection and require treatment by oxygen therapy, nebulized medication, and ventilatory support. These therapies are thought to generate droplets or aerosols. Based on pandemic experience, gas leakage via exhalation ports may also disperse infectious particles into the environment. During pandemics, HCWs and other patients are at risk for contamination because of the virus. In addition, pandemic planners have highlighted the potential need for providing mechanical ventilation in environments that are safe for HCWs. They have recommended airborne precautions for HCWs who are managing patients with pandemic influenza with increased transmissibility and during procedures that may generate small aerosol particles of respiratory secretions. However, it is not known how exhaled air and particles may disperse during NIV in clinical settings. There is no reliable marker that can be safely introduced to the patients [23\u201325].",

Therefore, HCWs providing NIV and chest physiotherapy working within 1 m of an infected patient should have a higher level of respiratory protection. Infection control measures designed to limit aerosol spread, such as negative-pressure rooms, may have less relevance.
