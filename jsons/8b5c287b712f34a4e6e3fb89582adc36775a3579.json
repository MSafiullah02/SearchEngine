            "text": "Introduction: Efforts to reduce central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates require strong microsystems for success. However, variation in practices across units leads to challenges in ensuring accountability. We redesigned the organization's mesosystem to provide oversight and alignment of microsystem efforts and ensure accountability in the context of the macrosystem. We implemented an A3 framework to achieve reductions in CLABSI through adherence to known evidence-based bundles. Methods: We conducted this CLABSI reduction improvement initiative at a 395-bed freestanding, academic, university-affiliated children's hospital. A mesosystem-focused A3 emphasized bundle adherence through 3 key drivers (1) practice standardization, (2) data transparency, and (3) accountability. We evaluated the impact of this intervention on CLABSI rates during the pre-intervention (01/15-09/17) and post-intervention (07/18-06/19) periods using a Poisson model controlling for baseline trends. Results: Our quarterly CLABSI rates during the pre-intervention period ranged from 1.0 to 2.3 CLABSIs per 1,000 central line-days. With the mesosystem in place, CLABSI rates ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 per 1,000 central line days during the post-intervention period. Adjusting for secular trends, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the post versus pre-intervention CLABSI rate of 71%. Conclusion: Our hospital-wide CLABSI rate declined for the first time in many years after the redesign of the mesosystem and a focus on practice standardization, data transparency, and accountability. Our approach highlights the importance of alignment across unit-level microsystems to ensure high-fidelity implementation of practice standards throughout the healthcare-delivery system.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] However, having a hospital policy for a central line bundle or having moderate adherence to the bundle is insufficient for the reduction of CLABSI. An adherence of 95% or greater is associated with a decline in CLABSI. 8 Despite knowing what to do, implementation remains challenging.",

First, the reliance on microsystems to define optimal processes for various populations results in variability from clinical unit to unit in whether and how standards are modified. Second, as microsystems adopt and iterate on variations of the bundle, we moved away from adherence to all of the bundle elements and focused instead on performance on individual elements to define success. This focus led to a perception that despite following most of the bundle elements, CLABSI rates were immutable. Third, microsystems also adapt performance measures specific to each unit, which meant there was an emphasis on different measures in each unit. As an example, due to gestational age restrictions on the use of chlorhexidine in neonates, the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) developed an alternate bathing protocol for their patients. These differences led to migration away from common standards, limiting transparency/ comparability, and making accountability challenging for an entire system. This variation also led to confusion for providers, caregivers, and patients when they moved between clinical units.",

Through this system-wide unit level dashboard, we changed from capturing missing elements on a sample of patients to visibility on adherence with all elements for all patients at a unit and hospital-level.

CLABSI SIR >1.0 indicates that there were more CLABSIs observed than predicted; conversely, a SIR <1.0 indicates that there were fewer CLABSIs observed than predicted. 18 We used statistical process control (SPC) charts to display the CLABSI rate and SIR over time. The center-line represents the average with 3 standard deviations upper and lower control limits included in the chart. The control charts were produced using the plug-in QI Macros for Excel.

Thus, our pre-intervention period ranged from January 2015 to September 2017, and our post-intervention period included data from July 2018 to June 2019. Our independent variables included the intervention (post versus pre-intervention), time (secular trends based on quarterly data), and an interaction term to determine whether the intervention resulted in a change in slope for the comparison of the post versus pre-implementation period. Since the interaction term was not significant, we present the most parsimonious CLABSI model here. We present incidence rate ratios with 95% CI.

Units governed their practices, and alignment with organizational standards or teams was not prioritized. In this initiative, our NICU team realigned efforts within the context of a mesosystem focused on CLABSI prevention, with specific, justifiable requests for adaptation of the standards for their population. For example, the NICU team specifically reviewed the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of chlorhexidine bathing in the NICU population. After their review, they requested the use of a bathing protocol that specifically incorporated the use of specific products and frequency by gestational age, which the CLABSI governance team approved based on their evidence review. Also, the NICU works in an open bay environment, where there were concerns about the role of the physical environment and risk for infections. Thus, the NICU also emphasized the importance of adherence to unit-specific environmental hygiene practices as a key component of their infection prevention efforts. Despite these unit-specific adaptations, the overall emphasis remained on all-or-none bundle adherence and accountability for practice. Data on bundle element adherence were provided to bedside nurses and unit leadership. Unit leadership conducted bedside bundle rounds to provide just-in-time education to bedside staff on best practices for individual bundle elements to ensure consistency and high reliability. Hospital leadership conducted rounds with the NICU teams to emphasize the importance of CLABSI prevention to the organization and to further enhance the sense of accountability at all levels. Figure 2 shows the quarterly CLABSI rates from January 2015 to June 2019, annotated with the implementation of interventions for the key drivers. Baseline quarterly CLABSI rates during the pre-intervention period ranged from 1.0 to 2.3 CLABSIs per 1,000 central linedays. During the post-intervention period, the quarterly CLABSI rate ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 per 1,000 central line days. When adjusting for secular trends, we found a statistically significant decrease in the post versus pre-intervention CLABSI rate of 71% (Table 1) .",

Second, our findings may have been due to a Hawthorne effect (changed behaviors while being observed), since there was consistent and very visible macrosystem focus on the goal of CLABSI reduction. Yet, a similar macrosystem focus in several years prior did not yield similar reductions in CLABSI. Finally, our post-intervention period only included four quarters of data; thus, we will need to continue monitoring to ensure the sustainability of the mesosystem intervention. However, by not adding to the workload of our front-line providers and streamlining it through a clear process, we believe the results of this intervention are sustainable. Ongoing work to integrate other best practices such as reducing placement of lines, prompt removal of lines, and reducing central line access will potentially further reduce the incidence of CLABSIs.",
