It can confer many learning benefits in complex topics such as bioethics, which demands a great level of understanding, due to its ability to help students reach their full potential. VR may hold great advantages for advancing bioethics distance education as participants can be immersed in a variety of situations that can aid understanding and promote practice and learning in ways that were not previously possible with traditional technologies (Boxes 1 and 2). VR also offers the potential to achieve an authentic experience and evoke J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 realistic responses in students. It is fundamentally a reality simulator where participants can be immersed in a scenario that depicts potentially real events, enabling them to act and respond realistically [9] . Through the case-study method we were able to teach ethical reasoning rather than just ethical principles. It is conceivable that the experience in bioethics in VR course also emboldened students by increasing their comfort levels in learning through doing, allowing them to feel at the teacher's center of attention ( Figure I in Box 2).",

Inside VR platforms, students are represented by customizable avatars. The Spatial platform, however, automatically generates a custom avatar based on a photograph of the students' face. All listed platforms were developed within the past 5 years. b VR platforms make it possible to live stream and record classes to streaming platforms such as YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook. c Content sharing allows the ability to display multimedia content on a projection screen. d World building allows educators to easily build and customize their own personalized classrooms. e Educational communities, such as Educators in VR, make use of these platforms to host events for educators and learners to prepare them for the use of immersive technologies in education. Joining Educators in VR led the Bioethics class to adopt AltSpaceVR as its hosting platform. In conjunction with Educators in VR, the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN) is hosting its 2020 annual conference in VR to provide training support to educators enabling them to implement VR in their courses. f Sharing content via browser allows educators and students to share screen, whiteboards, presentations, documents, and videos. Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible -anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. It is developed in a collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. to boost their confidence, especially for those who may have difficulty with face-to-face communication. Teachers in VR have exclusive access to a variety of 'host tools' that assist them in class management. These include a mute all button to limit distracting sounds, a message all button to text all students in class at once, a megaphone button to amplify the microphone, a stage blocking toggle to allow students access to the stage, giving them the opportunity to play a teacher role, and an audience participation panel that gives teachers the ability to see students who have raised their hands, giving them a turn to speak. As for the students, several engaging actions enable them to interact with teachers and with each other: the microphone toggle to mute or unmute their microphone, an emojis panel to express their understanding and to visually interact with the teachers and each other, a floating web browser that enables students to navigate to any content of interest to their learning class that can also be shared to display its content for everyone in the classroom, and a raise hand button that reflects students intent to ask a question.",

Moving beyond the traditional classroom environment, the pedagogical benefits of VR offer effective learning to students through new ways of interaction in student-centered and teacher-student double-centered fashions.Considering the impact VR can have on learning, and looking to add an extra dimension to bioethics course, we adopted AltspaceVR to educate the next generation of biotechnologists to think critically and creatively in exploring ethical situations in topical issues in biotechnology, and making informed decisions about those situations (Figure I",

Integrating VR technology into bioethics education can improve the quality and outcomes of education programs by allowing students an experiential learning component and educators to bring bioethics into the classroom in a cost-efficient way. VR technology is revolutionizing the digital learning experience and we are only at the tip of the iceberg. Fostering Creative Critical Thinking and Ethical Reasoning Skills Through Bioethics Education in VR Classroom advances, there is an increasing need for leaders who are able to think critically about pressing ethical issues around it. The bioethics in VR course was designed to rigorously combine both foundational and practice-based learning experiences, including in-depth discussions of hypothetical and actual examples. The course demonstrated that students in VR have acquired extensive knowledge of current thinking in bioethics; have collected, synthesized, and critically reflected on ethical issues of biotechnology; and have developed ethical reasoning about the societal value of biotechnology. Lectures in VR additionally discussed ethical issues related to the safety implications of genetic engineering, genome editing, and gene therapy (Figure I",

Ensuring students are engaged, enthused, and challenged throughout the online class is a key priority for bioethics distance education. We developed a virtual learning environment and delivered a University credit course in Altspace VR.The goals and objectives of the course were to develop more refined skills at ethical analysis and enhance the critical thinking and ethical reasoning ability among biotechnology students. The Bioethics VR course grounds students in interdisciplinary approaches and models to address the most pressing bioethical challenges in biotechnology. Lectures in VR classrooms provided students with the background information necessary to understand ethical dilemmas and explore issues at the intersection of ethics and biotechnology with an eye toward practical approaches and ethical responsibilities (Figure I). VR helped unlock students' potential, giving them new invaluable ways to experience learning by embracing critical thinking pedagogy with enthusiasm in classrooms.",
