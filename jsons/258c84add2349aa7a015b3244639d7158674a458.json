Asymptomatic infections can go unrecognized, but they have long-lasting consequences for children's growth and development. 1,2 Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment are of critical importance, not only for the individual, whose life and cognitive development are at risk, but also for the communities among whom uncontrolled pathogens can spread. Most are acquired through contaminated food or water; however, only small numbers of some pathogens (such as Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, rotaviruses, or noroviruses) can cause infection. These infections can spread by direct person-to-person contact, such as in crowded conditions or in institutions such as day care centers. New sensitive and specific diagnostic methods, such as direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of fecal specimens, have been used to identify pathogens such as enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) 3 ; this technology is only used in research settings but might someday be used in diagnosis. Currently, careful collection of a patient's history and simple tests, such as analysis of fecal leukocytes or inflammatory markers such as lactoferrin, neopterin, or calprotectin, are used in diagnosis and selection of therapy. This review focuses on pathophysiologies of 3 basic types of bacterial diarrheal diseases: enterotoxigenic upper small bowel infections (such as cholera); invasive or cytotoxininduced distal, colonic infections (such as Shigella dysentery or Clostridium difficile colitis); and diarrhea triggered by the host responses to pathogens (such as enteropathogenic E coli [EPEC] or EAEC).

Upper small bowel infections are relatively noninvasive and noninflammatory, causing watery diarrhea. Typically described as secretory, this type of diarrhea results from increased chloride se-cretion, decreased sodium absorption, or increased mucosal permeability. Cholera, the prototype of secretory diarrhea, is caused by the enterotoxin of Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin). Cholera toxin binds to the epithelial receptor GM 1 to activate adenylyl cyclase, which produces cyclic adenosine 3=,5= monophosphate (cAMP). Continuous cAMP production activates chloride channels, resulting in unabated water and electrolyte secretion that leads to voluminous watery diarrhea. 4 Similar to V cholerae, enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC; the main cause of traveler's diarrhea) produce enterotoxins that activate adenylate or guanylate, causing chloride secretion to the intestinal lumen. In addition, impaired sodium absorption and intestinal permeability have been implicated in this process. 5, 6 Other pathogens that cause secretory diarrhea have pathogenic mechanisms that include increased ion secretion, impaired absorption secondary to microvillus blunting, or disrupted intercellular junctions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 859, "end": 860, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1172, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1174, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 172, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 177, "end": 184, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Pathophysiology of Bacterial Diarrhea"}, {"text": "Distal small bowel and colonic infections tend to be invasive, causing more inflammatory colitis than upper small bowel infections.

The average oral intake for an adult is 1.5 L fluid/day. Combined with salivary, gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretions 7 L fluid enter the upper small bowel each day, most of which is absorbed by the time it reaches the distal small bowel. However, this small bowel fluid is mixed with a remarkable bidirectional flux of water and electrolytes in the upper small bowel that probably exceeds 50 L isotonic fluid each day, to aid in the absorption of digested dietary intake. 4 . This striking bidirectional electrolyte transport is driven by an active, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent active sodium (Na) absorption pump located on the basolateral membranes of both intestinal crypt and villus tip cells (middle). Because the chloride (Cl \u03ea ) channel is located on the luminal surface of the crypt cells, this Na pump mediates secretion of Cl \u03ea (along with Na and water) from the crypts and neutral NaCl absorption in the differentiated villus tip cells. Thus, a relatively slight shift in this large bidirectional flux can readily overload the colonic absorptive capacity, which rarely exceeds 2-3 L/day. Like cholera toxin (CT), E coli heat-labile toxin (LT) opens Cl \u03ea channels, leading to secretory watery diarrhea or traveler's diarrhea. The E coli heat-stable toxin (ST) activates guanylate cyclase to increase intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, inhibiting NaCl absorption and leading to secretory diarrhea. Selective damage of absorptive villus tips, which occurs in viral, protozoal, and other villus-damaging or inflammatory processes, leaves unbalanced secretory crypts that are not offset by healthy villus tip absorption, also leading to watery diarrhea.

In addition, in immunocompromised hosts, enteric adenoviruses and cytomegaloviruses can cause severe enterocolitis. Cellular invasion by the pathogens (in Shigella and others) or the presence of their toxins (in C difficile and B fragilis) elicits an inflammatory response from the host, causing chemokine secretion and recruitment of immune cells in the intestinal tissue.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 907, "end": 908, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathophysiology of Bacterial Diarrhea"}, {"text": "Secretory diarrhea is also caused by bacterial pathogens such as EAEC or EPEC, which activate cell signaling pathways that contribute to bowel disease and symptoms. These microbes colonize the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and then trigger inflammatory or \"attaching and effacing\" responses in host cells. They also produce toxins that can disrupt intestinal absorptive function and cause diarrhea. 7, 8 Viral and protozoan pathogens act through different mechanisms to induce secretory diarrhea. Rotaviruses, noroviruses, and protozoa such as Cryptosporidium primarily infect and damage the absorptive villus tips, leaving secretory crypts unbalanced, to cause net secretion and diarrhea. Rotaviruses cause winter-or dry-season diarrhea in young children worldwide, whereas noroviruses are the main causes of winter diarrhea in people of all ages in temperate regions as well as dry-season diarrhea in tropical areas. The protozoa Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium parvum or hominis, and Strongyloides stercoralis (the predominant helminth that causes diarrhea in tropical areas) disrupt absorptive villus architecture by direct infection or by triggering host epithelial or inflammatory responses. 9, 10 An overview of the fluid intake and output from the normal GI tract and the mechanisms by which these are altered by specific pathogens and their toxins are presented in Figure 1 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 397, "end": 399, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 400, "end": 401, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1204, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1205, "end": 1207, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1378, "end": 1386, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Pathophysiology of Bacterial Diarrhea"}, {"text": "For many years, enteric infections were diagnosed by analysis of bacterial cultures and microscopy to detect ova and parasites. Selective agars allow culture of specific Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, Yersinia, and Campylobacter species. Isolation of cultured organisms is still an invaluable tool for determining sensitivity to antimicrobial agents in clinical settings and for identifying specific strains, virulence factors, or toxins during investigations of outbreaks. In some instances, such as in diagnosis of patients with E coli-induced diarrhea, colony-based techniques that use serotyping or HEp-2 adherence assays are used. These traditional methods for differentiating E coli strains are less sensitive than PCR analyses of isolates or stool samples; they are also a challenge when the sample produces few colonies, such as a sample from a patient with early-phase gastroenteritis. 11 Bacterial genes can be detected in stool samples with the use of molecular diagnostic techniques, although this method is still limited to research settings. For other pathogens it is more important to identify the toxins than the organisms themselves; this is the case for the enterotoxigenic Vibrios and E coli, as well as the shiga toxin of enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC), which is produced by more E coli strains than the classic, sorbitol-negative O157:H7. Furthermore, C difficile produces toxins A and B. Many E coli and C difficile isolates do not produce these toxins and are therefore not pathogens. So detection of the toxins is actually more relevant to diagnosis than simply culturing the organism. Light microscopy to view ova and parasites had been the traditional technique used to diagnose intestinal parasitism. Although microscopy has the advantage of low cost, its sensitivity depends on the burden of infection, the freshness of the specimen, and the experience level of the microscopist. Stains are used to improve detection of specific organisms. Coccidian parasites can be visualized with a variety of stains, including modified Ziehl-Neelsen, Kinyoun acid-fast, Auramine-rhodamine, Gomori's trichrome, or Giemsa. Cyclospora and Isospora typically autofluoresce; therefore, they can be detected by epifluorescence microscopy. Each organism can be identified through its size and shape: Cryptosporidium are round or oval and approximately 4 -7m in diameter; Cyclospora are about twice the size of Cryptosporidium; Isospora are ellipsoid and approximately 10 -20 m by 20 -33 m in size. Fluorescence-labeled antibodies against specific parasites have improved the sensitivity and specificity of epifluorescence microscopy analyses to 98%-100%. 12 Many laboratories have replaced diagnostic methods, based on microscopy of fecal samples, with more sensitive and specific (and less observer-dependent) enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) methods; ELISA is used to detect protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium in fecal samples.

Patients with symptoms of cryptosporidiosis require prompt rehydration therapy; epidemiologic and clinical analyses should then be performed ( Figure 2 ). In resource-sufficient areas, diarrheal illnesses occur largely in 4 general epidemiologic settings; diagnosis of patients in each of these requires a distinct approach. Diarrheal diseases are most commonly community-acquired (infant, childhood, and adult settings), hospital-acquired, acquired during travel (eg, traveler's diarrhea), or persistent (in normal and compromised hosts). Knowledge of these epidemiologic settings has helped researchers to develop algorithms for the approach, diagnosis, and treatment plans of patients who present with presumed infectious diarrhea ( Figure 3 ). Information about symptoms, the length of time the patients have been sick, the number of individuals affected, the patients' recent histories, and diet guide the practitioner in making a diagnosis. If diarrhea is severe, bloody, or inflammatory or if an outbreak is suspected, fecal specimens should be obtained for further diagnostic and possible therapeutic considerations.

Rotaviruses and noroviruses have similar modes of transmission: both are passed person to person, with outbreaks occurring in close settings such as day care centers, long-term care facilities, schools, and within families. Norovirus can also be spread by contaminated food or water. The previous name of norovirus, \"winter vomiting disease,\" is a graphic reminder of its seasonality and main symptoms, although in adults the principal presentation is diarrheal illness.

Diagnosis, treatment, and causes of diarrheal diseases. For patients with diarrheal illnesses, it is important to first adequately assess the patient and determine the level of dehydration (panel 1). Important factors include duration of illness; alertness, skin turgor, mucous membrane dryness, sunken eyes or fontanelles, and postural hypotension all indicate moderate or severe hypovolemia and dehydration; signs of inflammation include fever, bloody stool, and tenesmus. In cases of dehydration (panel 2), patients can be rehydrated by oral administration of fluids that contain glucose, sugar or starch, and electrolytes; and patients can be given bismuth subsalicylate or loperamide if their diarrhea is not bloody (panel 2). If patients are unconscious or vomiting, fluids should be replaced intravenously. Pediatric patients can be given an oral rehydration solution made of sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, and glucose or glucose polymer (such as sucrose) in water. Or, table salt and sugar can be added to orange juice, and bananas can be added to provide potassium. There are a number of epidemiologic and clinical clues that can be used to identify the infectious agent (panel 3). Epidemiologic factors that should be considered include the food that patients have eaten (raw, undercooked meats, raw seafood), antibiotics taken (especially for C difficile infection), sexual practices (men who have sex with men might have proctitis or colitis with sexually transmitted pathogens), and recent travel (indicate bacterial pathogens such as enterotoxigenic E coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter; persistent diarrhea can be caused by protozoans such as Giardia or Cryptosporidium). Outbreaks of viral-related (norovirus or rotavirus) disease or those caused by organisms with relatively low-infectious inocula that are spread by fecal oral contact, such as Shigella, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium, are most commonly observed in day care settings. Other epidemiologic clues include immunoglobulin A deficiency, which predisposes to giardiasis, and immunosuppression (particularly in patients with AIDS), which can lead to protozoal infections, Mycobacterium avium complex, and intestinal cytomegalovirus infections. Clinical features can also be used to identify the infectious agent. Bloody diarrhea is associated with Shiga toxin-producing E coli, Shigella and E histolytica infections; abdominal pain with Yersinia and some C difficile infections; dysentery with Shigella or Campylobacter infection; wasting with Giardia or Cryptosporidium infection; and fecal inflammation with Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and some E coli and C difficile infections. and enterotoxigenic B fragilis. Cases can be sporadic and isolated or part of a large-scale outbreak, such as the recent outbreaks of salmonellosis.

Normal intestinal physiology and alteration by pathogens and their toxins. The average oral intake for an adult is 1.5 L fluid/day. Combined with salivary, gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretions 7 L fluid enter the upper small bowel each day, most of which is absorbed by the time it reaches the distal small bowel. However, this small bowel fluid is mixed with a remarkable bidirectional flux of water and electrolytes in the upper small bowel that probably exceeds 50 L isotonic fluid each day, to aid in the absorption of digested dietary intake. 4 . This striking bidirectional electrolyte transport is driven by an active, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent active sodium (Na) absorption pump located on the basolateral membranes of both intestinal crypt and villus tip cells (middle). Because the chloride (Cl \u03ea ) channel is located on the luminal surface of the crypt cells, this Na pump mediates secretion of Cl \u03ea (along with Na and water) from the crypts and neutral NaCl absorption in the differentiated villus tip cells. Thus, a relatively slight shift in this large bidirectional flux can readily overload the colonic absorptive capacity, which rarely exceeds 2-3 L/day. Like cholera toxin (CT), E coli heat-labile toxin (LT) opens Cl \u03ea channels, leading to secretory watery diarrhea or traveler's diarrhea. The E coli heat-stable toxin (ST) activates guanylate cyclase to increase intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, inhibiting NaCl absorption and leading to secretory diarrhea. Selective damage of absorptive villus tips, which occurs in viral, protozoal, and other villus-damaging or inflammatory processes, leaves unbalanced secretory crypts that are not offset by healthy villus tip absorption, also leading to watery diarrhea. Small bowel pathogens are presented in the right panels: those that produce secretory enterotoxins are in the red box, those that selectively disrupt absorptive villus tips are in the green box, and ileocolonic pathogens are in the tan box.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Typical enteric pathogens", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Location </td><td>Pathogens </td><td>Pathophysiology\n</td></tr><tr><td>Upper small\n</td><td>Vibrio cholerae\n</td><td>Enterotoxigenic; damaging to absorptive villus tips; usually relatively noninflammatory\n</td></tr><tr><td>bowel\n</td><td>Enterotoxigenic E coli (heat-labile toxin, heat-stabile toxin, or both)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Rotaviruses\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Noroviruses\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Giardia intestinalis\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Strongyloides stercoralis\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Ileocolonic </td><td>Shigella\n</td><td>Often invasive or cytotoxigenic; usually inflammatory\n</td></tr><tr><td>Salmonella\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Campylobacter\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Yersinia\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Invasive E coli (EIEC)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Enteroaggregative E coli (EAEC)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Cytotoxigenic C difficile\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Entamoeba histolytica\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>?
