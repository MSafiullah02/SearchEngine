Although fomite transmission of viral pathogens is notoriously challenging to eliminate (e.g., via sanitization), simulation studies involving computational fluid dynamics suggest that low-cost solutions for the mitigation of indoor ventilation system transmission may exist.36,37 Unfortunately, such simulations remain limited in terms of use for recommendations due to lack of calibration and excessive utilization of free parameters, as well as notable absences of physical modeling for critical small-scale processes, such as mixing and pathogen re-suspension among others. However, recent validation studies\u2014which have directly measured the role of violent respiratory events (e.g., sneezing and coughing) on indoor environmental contamination\u2014show a new path ahead where pathogen loads, transport and mixing from a range of patient types can be addressed.19,20,31 Moving forward, such studies will likely be integral to the development and effective deployment of more robust solutions for low cost redesign of indoor ventilation systems and patient-specific pathogen containment strategies, which should be implemented and evaluated in hospitals that are likely to treat MERS cases in the future.",

However, doing so may be cost-prohibitive in low-resource healthcare settings. With this in mind, our study suggests that\u2014in addition to closely monitoring contacts of likely human-to-human transmission agents (i.e., MERS cases that fail to recover and cases at high risk of death) during future nosocomial outbreaks of MERS\u2014potential fomites with which patients may have had contact should be sanitized preferentially. Furthermore, if solutions for the mitigation of indoor ventilation system transmission cannot be implemented hospital-wide, wards intended for biosecurity level 2 respiratory pathogens (i.e., MERS-coronavirus) should be given precedence.",

As a result, direct causes of MERS-coronavirus infection (i.e., identification number of causative infectious case) were not deducible for 23% of cases, and additional variables that may have been of interest\u2014such as length of hospital stay and viral phylogenetic data\u2014were either incomplete or unavailable for analysis. Furthermore, because MERS-coronavirus and MERS remain scarce in the existing literature, the review-driven components of our study (Analysis 2) were broadened to include SARS-coronavirus and SARS, which\u2014although virologically and clinically similar\u2014are not without their differences.40,41 Thus, the mechanistic explanations proposed in Analysis 2 are tentative at best.",

In particular, indirect transmission (i.e., via fomites and/or indoor ventilation systems) must be demonstrably correlated with both environmental contamination and nosocomial amplification. Similarly, clinical manifestations (i.e., LRT infection and/or high viral load) must be demonstrably correlated with both case outcome and direct or indirect transmission in future nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-coronavirus.",

Cases that failed to recover from MERS may have spent longer periods of time within the hospital setting, giving them greater opportunity to cause both direct and indirect transmission\u2014perhaps via the mechanisms proposed above. When length of hospital stay was included in our multivariate logistic regression model and run against cases for which these data were available (n=166), case outcome remained the strongest predictor for human-to-human transmission of MERS-coronavirus, followed by length of hospital stay (Appendix II). Notably, the inclusion of length of hospital stay in the model moderately dampens the statistical significance of case outcome as a predictor, indicating that a confounding relationship between the two variables may indeed exist. That said, given the considerable gaps in the length of hospital stay data (>10%), results from this secondary analysis should be treated as preliminary and will be further extended as additional data become available.",

Forthcoming work will explore these factors\u2014namely, length of stay, visitor volume and virus dissemination (including aerosolizing procedures)\u2014and their impact on nosocomial amplification of MERS-coronavirus in the future.",
