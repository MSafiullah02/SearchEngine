From February 2018 to June 2018, 456 transgender women were recruited in the study using Respondent-Driven Sampling technique. Participants completed the computer-based questionnaire and were tested for HIV serostatus. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors related to HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV infection was 77 (16.5%), of which 19 (24.7%) were not aware of their HIV-positive status prior to the study. Factors associated with HIV infection included popper use (aOR 2.01, p = 0.044) and having regular male partner(s) (aOR 0.42, p = 0.006). More efforts are needed to reduce the high prevalence of HIV infection, such as expanding the reach of HIV screening and prevention programs to the transgender women population, particularly for substance users.",

The risk of HIV transmission related to engaging in receptive anal intercourse without condoms or medications was 13 times higher than vaginal intercourse [7] . The high prevalence of substance use among TGW has been reported in various studies [4, 8] as a contributing factor for HIV. The survey conducted in San Francisco revealed that 58% of TGW used alcohol and 43.3% used substances (marijuana, methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and \"club drugs\") [9] . Additionally, the high prevalence of commercial sex work within the TGW community was detected in previous findings ranging from 24 to 75% [2, 10, 11] .",

Although we have no clear explanation for the differences in HIV prevalence in TGW, we suggest that it might be related to the sampling variation in the two researches. The previous study recruited participants using the convenience sampling method [13] that might limit the ability to generalize the results to the study population [14, 21] . This study was conducted with a larger sample size with the RDS method. This sampling method was demonstrated to be successful in recruiting hard-to-reach populations [14, 15] . Moreover, the analysis took into account the potential biases in recruitment by applying RDS weights and made the results more generalizable [14, 22] . Over the last three years, there have been increasingly interventions that supported TGW in terms of raising their awareness of gender equality, gender identity rights, and health care rights including HIV prevention and treatment. Various organizations led by TGW and other sexual minorities have been reaching TGW with HIV and STI prevention information and referral to diagnosis and treatment services [23] . Thanks to recent progress in HIV/AIDS prevention and control in Vietnam, there was a two-thirds reduction in HIV prevalence in the population over the 10-year period from 2007 to 2017 [24, 25] , which might be linked to the lower prevalence in TGW.",

These tests were provided at the CBO which was most convenient for participants. The importance of CBO in screening, detecting new cases of HIV infection in the community as well as in referring TWG to the health care and prevention services has been promotedby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [5] . Since 2016, PEPFAR through USAID has piloted community-based HIV testing (lay-test) in Vietnam [23] . Under the program, CBOs in HCMC have been trained and started conducting lay-test at their offices. The introduction of communitybased HIV testing has increased the number of vulnerable and high risk-taking groups such as TGW to know their HIV status [23] , which is the first of the three major HIV-controls 90% tested, -90% on ARV and -90% having Table 3 Comparisons of sexual behaviors and substance use between TGW with positive and negative HIV serostatus viral load suppression. The Government of Vietnam has committed to these targets [26] . Furthermore, prevention methods, such as condom use and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) medication are also potential to reduce the high HIV prevalence among TGW. In literature, there are many studies have indicated the crucial role of condom use and PrEP in protecting against HIV infection in TGW population [27] [28] [29] . Therefore, CBOs should be provided with resources to expand their reach and services to TGW population, not only in HIV screening but also in community mobilization, coordinated referral networks, and prevention services, such as condom or PrEP medication distribution.",

The HIV rate among transgender women using poppers was twice as high compared with those who did not use poppers. Popper use has been well documented in previous studies as a predictor of HIV infection [30, 31] . There might be two explanationsfor this result. Firstly, TGW who engage in receptive anal intercourse might use poppers to increase dilation of the anal sphincter, reducing possible discomfort during anal intercourse. Furthermore, some previous studies showed that the receptive role in the anal intercourse was associated with decreased condom use, since those who took the insertive position had more autonomy a ORs were obtained from weighted estimates [32] . Secondly, like other club drugs, poppers also had the pharmacological and neurological effects on sexual behaviors, such as promoting sexual desire, reducing sexual inhibition, modifying mental states, and decreasing physical experiences of pain [33, 34] . This might further increase risks of HIV transmission during sexual intercourse since these effects of poppers can prevent users from using condoms and lead to group sex behaviors [34, 35] . This study revealed that HIV prevalence among transgender women with a regular male partner was significantly lower compared with those who did not have a regular male partner. This finding is understandable as having a regular partner was equivalent to intercourse with fewer partners, thus, decreased the risk of exposure to HIV than others.",

Accessing health care services by TGW is still limited, especially for HIV prevention and care interventions. Therefore, reaching out to such a hard-to-reach population plays a key role in the success of an intervention program. In this study, the RDS approach was shown to be effective in reaching the TGW community and in detecting new HIV cases, with 19 new cases out of 456 participants. The RDS is also considered as a relatively simple and low-cost way. Therefore, HIV intervention programs can be tailored based on such peer network approach to expand their reach to TGW as well as other members of the LGBT community.",
