A working definition of SARS is important,2 although clinical conditions rarely remain within artificial boundaries. Some patients might not have all features, others may present unusually. Fever is a cardinal symptom but not always so, and is sometimes absent in elderly patients. Some patients have presented with diarrhoea or, in at least two cases, with severe acute abdominal pain requiring exploratory laparotomy. All these patients developed typical SARS. Patients presenting with other respiratory infections must now all be regarded as potential SARS cases until proven otherwise. Contact with a known case is an important discriminator but, if emphasised too strongly in the diagnostic process, may lead to false positives or negatives.",

Three major reasons for spread of infection to health-care workers have been: failure to apply isolation precautions to cases not yet identified as SARS, breaches of procedure, and inadequate precautions. Every patient must now be assumed to have SARS, which has major long-term implications for the health-care system. Another reason for spread among health-care workers is infected workers continuing to work despite symptoms, such as mild fever. Such individuals must now cease working. However, staying at home can also have disastrous consequences for exposed family members. Potential cases therefore require early isolation from both workplace and household. Extreme measures are required to protect health-care workers, who account for about 20% of cases.",

He had pneumonia which progressed initially despite antibiotics, but after 7 days he improved without additional treatment.1 On March 10, 18 health-care workers at PWH were ill and 50 potential cases among staff were identified later that day. Further staff, patients, and visitors became ill over the next few days and there was subsequent spread to their contacts. By March 25, 156 patients had been admitted to PWH with SARS, all traceable to this index case.1 One important factor in the extensive dissemination of infection appears to have been the use of nebulised bronchodilator, which increased the droplet load surrounding the patient. Overcrowding in the hospital ward and an outdated ventilation system may also have contributed.",

The source has been attributed to a patient with renal failure receiving haemodialysis at PWH who stayed with his brother at Amoy Gardens.11 He had diarrhoea, and infection may have spread to other residents by a leaking sewage drain allowing an aerosol of virus-containing material to escape into the narrow lightwell between the buildings and spread in rising air-currents. Sewage also backflowed into bathroom floor drains in some apartments. Spread to people in nearby buildings also occurred, probably by person-to-person contact and contamination of public installations.",

Why the disease spread in the Kowloon hotel has not been clarified, and there are many other important issues. \u201cSuper-spreaders\u201d may be prone to carry a high viral load because of defects in their immune system, as could be the case in the patient with end-stage renal failure implicated in the Amoy Gardens outbreak and another with renal failure at the centre of an outbreak in Singapore. Subclinical infections may also occur and will not be recognisable until reliable diagnostic tests are available. Procedures causing high risk to medical personnel include nasopharyngeal aspiration, bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, airway suction, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and non-invasive ventilation procedures. Cleaning the patient and the bedding after faecal incontinence also appears to be a high-risk procedure.",

The clinical impression is that pulsed steroids sometimes produce a dramatic response.
