A vendor needs effective communication abilities to appeal to individuals\u2019 emotions and persuade them. Hence, he uses empathy to understand clients\u2019 feelings. Also, empathizing with others in different life and work situations is a fundamental communication skill (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-43999-6_5).",

In the following we describe some of them.Phishing: This is the most popular application of social engineering. It is the fraudulent practice of sending emails, usually appearing to come from a well-known source (e.g. an important organization) to steal sensitive information, like passwords, credit card numbers, etc.Spear phishing: It is a form of phishing tailored to the target recipient (individual or groups). Attackers study the behaviour of their targets and collect information to make the attack believable, in order to increase the likelihood of its success. When victims receive a spear phishing email, they think that the communication comes from a trusted source. For example, Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a fraud where the attacker impersonates an organization executive to lead an authorized employee in that organization to perform a wire transfer to an account controlled by the same attacker.Pretexting: Social engineering needs to achieve trust to be successful. For this purpose, it uses an appropriate scenario fabricated in order to convince a targeted victim. Pretexting consists, for example, of impersonating someone else, e.g. a police officer, or an insurance investigator.Tailgating: In this physical form of social engineering, someone gains access to a building or to a restricted area without proper authentication, but exploiting a convenient situation, for example, following another person entering the property.Whaling: In this form of phishing the main characteristic is the type of target, represented by senior executives, representative people of government agencies, politicians, and celebrities. Given the relevance of the target (big fish), the value of information is particularly attractive to cybercriminals. Like spear phishing, the scam email is tailor made, and appears to come from a business partner.Vishing: This is a phone scam which combines phishing and voice. Vishing can be considered the telephone equivalent of phishing. Here, given that the fraudulent action is over the phone, empathy and the ability of handling conversation are needed for the success of the attack.\n",

In the indirect way, instead, manipulation works without starting an explicit relationship with victims.
