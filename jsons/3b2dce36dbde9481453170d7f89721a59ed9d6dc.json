Nonetheless the potential for antibody testing to increase viral transmission must be considered alongside the potential benefits the tests might have in allowing the easing of lockdown restrictions. Clear communication about the ongoing need for handwashing, in particular, will be essential and raising public awareness of the main mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 is transmittedthrough air and surfacesmight help improve adherence. This, in addition to acknowledgment of the imperfect nature of the tests, will give the public a more accurate representation of the meaning and implications of an antibody test result and a better understanding of how to reduce the risk of transmission.

The effectiveness of antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 will depend not only on the extent and duration of any immunity conferred and the performance of a test, but also upon a good understanding of the meaning of tests results among those offered them. First, the use of the term Immunity should be avoided in phrases to describe antibody tests, whether described as Passports, Certificates or Tests. Second, research is needed to evaluate different ways of informing those offered tests and receiving tests results to minimise the proportion erroneously perceiving an antibody-positive test result to mean no risk of becoming infected with the virus. It should also focus on maximising understanding that -regardless of antibody-status -anyone can indirectly transmit the virus by touching a contaminated surface and infecting the next surface they touch. Hand washing or sanitising therefore need to remain frequent. Research is also needed with those undergoing actual tests, powered to detect effects judged meaningful in the context of a population-based testing programme and involving measures of actual behaviour.",
