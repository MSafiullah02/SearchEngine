We employ both featurebased models and neural architectures using monolingual word representation. We compare the performance of these systems with state-of-theart systems to identify their capabilities. We show that these monolingual models trained separately on different languages using multilingual word representation or text-based features can open the door to irony detection in languages that lack of annotated data for irony.",

Although recent studies pointed out the issue of false-alarm hashtags in selflabeled data [20] , ID via hashtag filtering provides researchers positive examples with high precision. On the other hand, systems are not able to detect irony in languages where such filtering is not always possible. Multilingual prediction (either relying on machine translation or multilingual embedding methods) is a common solution to tackle under-resourced languages [6, 33] . While multilinguality has been widely investigated in information retrieval [27, 34] and several NLP tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis [3, 4] and named entity recognition [30] ), no one explored it for irony.",

Our approach does not rely either on machine translation or parallel corpora (which are not always available), but rather builds on previous corpus-based studies that show that irony is a universal phenomenon and many languages share similar irony devices. For example, Karoui et al. [24] concluded that their multi-layer annotated schema, initially used to annotate French tweets, is portable to English and Italian, observing relatively the same tendencies in terms of irony categories and markers. Similarly, Chakhachiro [8] studies irony in English and Arabic, and shows that both languages share several similarities in the rhetorical (e.g., overstatement), grammatical (e.g., redundancy) and lexical (e.g., synonymy) usage of irony devices. The next step now is to show to what extent these observations are still valid from a computational point of view. Our contributions are: I. A new freely available corpus of Arabic tweets manually annotated for irony detection 1 . II. Monolingual ID: We propose both feature-based models (relying on language-dependent and language-independent features) and neural models to measure to what extent ID is language dependent. III. Cross-lingual ID: We experiment using cross-lingual word representation by training on one language and testing on another one to measure how the proposed models are culture-dependent. Our results are encouraging and open the door to ID in languages that lack of annotated data for irony.",

As continuous word embedding spaces exhibit similar structures across (even distant) languages [28] , we use a multilingual word representation which aims to learn a linear mapping from a source to a target embedding space.

We perform several experiments by training on one language (lang 1 ) and testing on another one (lang 2 ) (henceforth lang 1 \u2192 lang 2 ). We get 6 configurations, plus two others to evaluate how irony devices are expressed cross-culturally, i.e. in European vs. non European languages. In each experiment, we took 20% from the training to validate the model before the testing process. Table 3 presents the results. From a semantic perspective, despite the language and cultural differences between Arabic and French languages, CNN results show a high performance comparing to the other languages pairs when we train on each of these two languages and test on the other one. Similarly, for the French and English pair, but when we train on French they are quite lower. We have a similar case when we train on Arabic and test on English. We can justify that by, the language presentation of the Arabic and French tweets are quite informal and have many dialect words that may not exist in the pretrained embeddings we used comparing to the English ones (lower embeddings coverage ratio), which become harder for the CNN to learn a clear semantic pattern. Another point is the presence of Arabic dialects, where some dialect words may not exist in the multilingual pretrained embedding model that we used. On the other hand, from the text-based perspective, the results show that the text-based features can help in the case when the semantic aspect shows weak detection; this is the case for the Ar \u2212\u2192 En configuration. It is worthy to mention that the highest result we get in this experiment is from the En \u2192 Fr pair, as both languages use Latin characters. Finally, when investigating the relatedness between European vs. non European languages (cf. (En/Fr) \u2192 Ar), we obtain similar results than those obtained in the monolingual experiment (macro F-score 62.4 vs. 68.0) and best results are achieved by Ar \u2192 (En/Fr). This shows that there are pragmatic devices in common between both sides and, in a similar way, similar text-based patterns in the narrative way of the ironic tweets.",

We show that simple monolingual architectures (either neural or feature-based) trained separately on each language can be successfully used in a multilingual setting providing a crosslingual word representation or basic surface features. Our monolingual results are comparable to state of the art for the three languages. The CNN architecture trained on cross-lingual word representation shows that irony has a certain similarity between the languages we targeted despite the cultural differences which confirm that irony is a universal phenomena, as already shown in previous linguistic studies [9, 24, 35] . The manual analysis of the common misclassified tweets across the languages in the multilingual setup, shows that classification errors are due to three main factors. (1) First, the absence of context where writers did not provide sufficient information to capture the ironic sense even in the monolingual setting, as in (Let's start again, get off get off Mubarak!! ) where the writer mocks the Egyptian revolution, as the actual president \"Sisi\" is viewed as Mubarak's fellows. (2) Second, the presence of out of vocabulary (OOV) terms because of the weak coverage of the multilingual embeddings which make the system fails to generalize when the OOV set of unseen words is large during the training process. We found tweets in all the three languages written in a very informal way, where some characters of the words were deleted, duplicated or written phonetically (e.g phat instead of fat). (3) Another important issue is the difficulty to deal with the Arabic language. Arabic tweets are often characterized by non-diacritised texts, a large variations of unstandardized dialectal Arabic (recall that our dataset has 4 main varieties, namely Egypt, Gulf, Levantine, and Maghrebi), presence of transliterated words (e.g. the word table becomes (tabla)), and finally linguistic code switching between Modern Standard Arabic and several dialects, and between Arabic and other languages like English and French. We found some tweets contain only words from one of the varieties and most of these words do not exist in the Arabic embeddings model. For example in (Since many days Mubarak didn't die .. is he sick or what? #Egypt), only the words (day), (Mubarak), and (he) exist in the embeddings. Clearly, considering only these three available words, we are not able to understand the context or the ironic meaning of the tweet. To conclude, our multilingual experiments confirmed that the door is open towards multilingual approaches for ID. Furthermore, our results showed that ID can be applied to languages that lack of annotated data. Our next step is to experiment with other languages such as Hindi and Italian.",
