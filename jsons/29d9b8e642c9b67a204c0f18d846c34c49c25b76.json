Absence of SR-like RNA-binding protein Slr1 slows hyphal formation and decreases virulence in a systemic candidiasis model, suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation in these processes. SR (serine-arginine)-rich proteins influence multiple steps in mRNA metabolism and their localization and function are frequently controlled by modification. We now demonstrate that Slr1 binds to polyadenylated RNA and that its intracellular localization is modulated by phosphorylation and methylation. Wildtype Slr1-GFP is predominantly nuclear, but also co-fractionates with translating ribosomes. The non-phosphorylatable slr1-6SA-GFP protein, in which six serines in SR/RS clusters are substituted with alanines, primarily localizes to the cytoplasm in budding cells. Intriguingly, hyphal cells display a slr1-6SA-GFP focus at the tip near the Spit-zenk\u20ac orper, a vesicular structure involved in molecular trafficking to the tip. The presence of slr1-6SA-GFP hyphal tip foci is reduced in the absence of the mRNA-transport protein She3, suggesting that unphosphorylated Slr1 associates with mRNA-protein complexes transported to the tip.

Interestingly, we find that C-terminal S-to-A mutations that block Slr1 phosphorylation also cause Slr1 to accumulate not only in the cytoplasm of yeast-form cells, but also at the hyphal tip in a region close to the Spitzenk\u20ac orper, a vesicular structure involved in trafficking lipids and proteins to the tip. The hyphal tip localization of mutant Slr1 is also partially dependent on the presence of mRNA transport protein She3. Combined with additional evidence that wildtype Slr1 interacts with polyadenylated RNA and mRNA-binding proteins, these results suggest a model in which unphosphorylated Slr1 associates with mRNA-protein complexes transported to the hyphal tip where the mRNA is locally translated and that phosphorylation facilitates release of Slr1 from such transport complexes.

Partial functionality of the C. albicans Slr1 C-terminus in S. cerevisiae Npl3.

White boxes indicate ScNpl3 domains; black boxes indicate equivalent CaSlr1 domains that are replaced within ScNpl3 (C@C-terminus). To test for chimeric ScNpl3 function, cells were grown to mid-log-phase and serial ten-fold dilutions plated on medium lacking leucine and containing 5-FOA (selecting for loss of the ScNPL3 URA3 plasmid). Cells were also plated on medium lacking leucine and uracil to confirm equal cell numbers.

This region is critical for ScNpl3 function: deletion of the R-rich region and C-terminus severely abrogates S. cerevisiae growth (McBride et al., 2009) . Therefore, to determine whether this sequence similarity is functionally relevant, the ability of the R-rich region of Slr1 to substitute for that of ScNpl3 was tested.

This clustering of SR/RS dipeptides in Slr1 raises the question of whether the regulation of Slr1 by phosphorylation may be more similar to that of SpSrp1 family proteins than that of ScNpl3. Phosphatase treatment of Slr1-GFP and slr1-6SA-GFP indicated that Slr1 is likely phosphorylated at multiple sites within the SR region (Fig. 4A ). Phosphorylation of one or more residues may control additional phosphorylation events, as seen in the sequential phosphorylation of serine residues in human SR protein ASF/SF2 (Ngo et al., 2008) . Whereas wildtype Slr1-GFP is predominantly nuclear, the S-to-A substitutions increase cytoplasmic levels of Slr1-GFP, suggesting that phosphorylation promotes import of Slr1 (Fig. 5) , potentially by facilitating interaction with a conserved Mtr10 import receptor complex, as seen for S. cerevisiae Npl3 (Yun and Fu, 2000) . Phosphorylation of the SR domain of multiple metazoan SR proteins similarly allows binding to the importin transportin-SR (Lai et al., 2000) . The cytoplasmic localization of slr1-6SA-GFP in C. albicans decreases in the absence of arginine methyltransferase Hmt1 (Fig. 5) , supporting a role for methylation in nuclear export of Slr1, as seen for ScNpl3 and CaNpl3 (Shen et al., 1998; McBride et al., 2007) . Therefore, the impact of post-translational modification on Slr1 nucleocytoplasmic transport is more similar to the effects of modifications on Npl3 family proteins than on SpSrp1, correlating with greater similarity of the Npl3 and Slr1 Rrich domains rather than with the clustered arrangement of SR/RS motifs. Interestingly, subcellular localization of slr1-6SA-GFP was also detected in cytoplasmic foci in both budding and hyphal cells, including near the bud neck and hyphal tip. These foci could reflect increased interaction of cytoplasmic unphosphorylated slr1-6SA-GFP with ribonucleoprotein complexes in subcellular domains such as RNA-processing bodies (P-bodies), stress granules (Buchan and Parker, 2009) , or target regions for mRNA transport. P-bodies accumulate during C. albicans hyphal induction (Jung and Kim, 2011) , but they are not specifically detected at the hyphal tip; the less intense slr1-6SA-GFP foci present throughout the hypha (e.g., Fig. 10A ) may indicate association of slr1-6SA-GFP with these RNA-rich cytoplasmic regions. Lack of phosphorylation of an SR motif in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) nucleocapsid protein has been implicated in accumulation of this viral SR protein in stress granules (Peng et al., 2008) .
