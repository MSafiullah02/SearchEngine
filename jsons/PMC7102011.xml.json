            "text": "Patients with prolonged neutropenia after chemotherapy are prone to serious infections. Despite appropriate antibiotic and antimycotic treatment, mortality is considerable [2]. Approximately 6% of paediatric oncological patients develop a septic shock, and about 5% of these patients die despite intensive care treatment. In children who have undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT), mortality increases to 40% [2]. Given the generally improved prognosis for the treatment of childhood cancer, infections are of major concern to oncologists. Response rates in treating bacterial, fungal or viral infections during neutropenia remain unsatisfying [9, 23]. The success of sepsis therapy is based on multiple factors and is related to the recovery from neutropenia, even though morbidity and mortality are not only linked to the duration of neutropenia but also depend on comorbidity [8, 15]. Reconstitution of the host defence system may improve the outcome during neutropenia-associated infections. Transfusions of recombinant granulocyte-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) mobilised granulocytes (GTX) are a supportive measure that are controversially discussed for patients with severe infections. Data that confirm the value of GTX are limited, and results of the studies are heterogeneous and inconclusive [3\u20135, 7, 20\u201322].",

One child was treated for sepsis with respiratory failure during neutropenia of unknown aetiology. The decision to initiate GTX was made on an individual basis when antibiotic and antimycotic therapy failed to resolve a proven or suspected infection. All children were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count <500/\u03bcl), at least 3 days before the first GTX, and were expected not to resolve from neutropenia within the next 5 days. All children were febrile (body temperature above 38.5\u00b0C) and showed increasing C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with additional clinical signs of an uncontrolled infection, e.g. respiratory deterioration (accelerated respiratory rate or additional oxygen requirement) and/ or hypotension (blood pressure<fifth percentile for age) (Table 2). Hence, all patients included in the analysis were suffering from sepsis or even severe sepsis or septic shock according to the definitions specified by Goldstein et al. and the Members of the International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis [6], as shown in the list below: \n\nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) Presence of 2 of the following criteria \n1.1.Core temperature >38.5\u00b0C or <36\u00b0C1.2.Tachycardia (for definitions, see Goldstein et al.)1.3.Mean respiratory rate >2 SD above normal or mechanical ventilation1.4.Leucocyte count elevated or depressed (not secondary to chemotherapy)\n\nSepsis SIRS in the presence or as a result of a suspected or proven infection\nSevere sepsis Sepsis plus one of the following: \n3.1.cardiovascular dysfunction or3.2.acute respiratory distress syndrome or3.3.two or more other organ dysfunctions\n\nSeptic shock Sepsis and cardiovascular dysfunction\n",

To be included in the study, the donors had to fulfil the criteria of the German Medical Association and the German Society for Transfusion Medicine for haemapheresis donors. The granulocyte mobilisation and collection schedule has been previously described [11]. Briefly, the donors were given glycosylated G-CSF (Lenograstim, Chugai Pharma, Japan) as a single subcutaneous injection plus oral dexamethasone (DXM; Fortecortin, Merck, Germany). Lenograstim is commercially available as Granocyte13 (=105 \u03bcg Lenograstim) or Granocyte34 (=263 \u03bcg Lenograstim). The substance was administered at different total doses of either 526 \u03bcg [=2 ampoules Granocyte34 (n=52)], or 263 \u03bcg [=1 ampoule Granocyte34 (n=73)] or at 105 \u03bcg [=1 ampoule Granocyte13 (n=43)]. For a specific donor, these regimen resulted in a median dose per kilogram donor body weight of 6 (4.3\u20137.9) \u03bcg/kg Lenograstim for patients (=recipients) with a body weight >60 kg, a median dose of 3 (2.4\u20134.1) \u03bcg/kg Lenograstim for patients with a body weight ranging from 20 to 60 kg, and a median dose of 1.5 (1.0\u20132.3) \u03bcg/kg Lenograstim (n=43) for patients with a body weight below 20 kg. Additionally, all donors received 8 mg oral DXM. Both Lenograstim and DXM were given simultaneously 16 (13\u201319) hours before polymorphonuclear (PMN) apheresis. Leukapheresis was performed on the blood cell separator (Cobe Spectra) using the single stage WBC cytapheresis set and the PMN program of the Spectra software version 4.7. We followed a standard procedure that has been previously described [11]. The final product was tested for complete blood count and irradiated with 30 Gy. The Granulocytes were transfused on the same day, usually 3\u20136 h after the apheresis. The transfusion regimen differed slightly from one patient to the other; in general, we attempted an every other day schedule (=three GTX per week), which proved to be the easiest strategy to circumvent organisational difficulties.",
