Implementation science is the rigorous study of implementation, described as the method to promote the uptake of clinical research findings and other evidence-based practice into routine practice and hence improve the quality and effectiveness of healthcare [2]. Unfortunately, these definitions exclude a temporal aspect \u2013 that is, how we get what works to the people who need it with the greatest speed and efficiency. Some of the early developers of implementation science recognised this in real-world systems-thinking and methods and began responding to estimates that the time it takes to implement research into clinical practice is 17 years on average, with low uptake of evidence-based findings implemented in practice and poor effect sizes when adopted [3]. This time-gap paradigm has created many challenges for practitioners and policy makers who need rapid, actionable results, such that multiple stakeholders (e.g., practitioners, patients, families, decision-makers, administrator and policy makers) are beginning to question implementation success [4, 5]. This is understandable given the poor outcomes from these necessary but what seems insufficient approaches. There remains a troubling implementation gap, defined as the difference between our knowledge of what works and the time it takes to get that knowledge into practice in real-world settings.",

We can ask whether rapid implementation can be informed by implementation science, but it has yet to be defined in the literature, and studies are few and far between; nor has there been a systematic review on rapid implementation studies undertaken to date within the healthcare and medical spheres. This absence impedes our ability to understand and enable rapid, evidence-based findings to find their way quickly into clinical practice [6]. Similarly, the importance of defining concepts has been shown in the work of behaviour change interventions indicating that without standardised behavioural definitions it is difficult to replicate effective interventions and challenging to identify techniques contributing to effectiveness across interventions [7]. By providing a clear definition of rapid implementation, we avoid concerns previously directed at the science and practice of implementation related to poor consistency of terminology for core concepts that resulted in researchers characterising implementation science as a Tower of Babel [8]. A clear definition will ensure that throughout the research or implementation science field we are all talking about rapid implementation in the same way. This will aid the research community to communicate effectively within and between disciplines, and to apply evidence-based research findings [9]. We sought to use concept analysis to provide a theoretical definition and identify essential elements of rapid implementation.",

Although scores for the quantitative studies were high, this was not the case for qualitative studies. For example, part of the selection criteria involved the inclusion of literature reviews to enrich the information available for assessment; however, not all criteria were applicable for assessing literature reviews thus lowering quality assessment for these studies (see Table 4). While quality assessment was not a criterion for inclusion, in line with Sandelowski, et al\u2019s [48]. study, to exclude studies based on quality appraisal could result in valuable data being lost.

            "text": "The fundamental basis of rapid implementation is clinical practice \u2013 with its need for fast information on which to base good clinical decisions. It is exemplified here by precision medicine, which is amongst those areas leading the field in the application of rapid implementation approaches and ideas [43\u201346, 55]. Attributes of rapid implementation (adapting methods, procedures, and frameworks) are challenging traditional implementation and the consequence is that rapid implementation can help bridge time-gaps between research and practice (working on, for example, research practice and clinical policy simultaneously, or re-thinking and shortening the length of trials). In particular, antecedents that relate to clinical practice areas and attributes of rapid implementation that challenge traditions are of particular significance, appreciating the bidirectional relationship between practice and research. The clinical practice studies retrieved discussed science areas such as genomics that have evolved quickly within the precision medicine paradigm [43\u201347, 55] and suggested that these areas require research findings to be produced quickly, to provide recommendations, so that a patient can be treated in a timely way. These efforts have now included calls for more appropriate trial designs such as basket trials or umbrella trials [43] and qualitative trials [10]. Ways to address this problem can be found within the core attributes of rapid implementation: to feedback information and findings more quickly to clinical practice. The research literature also calls for a redefinition of rigour in undertaking a rapid implementation study as part of the implementation science agenda, along with the view that rapid learning research systems need to be deployed to ensure that research can meet the time-pressured demands of clinical practice [56]. In this respect, there is broad agreement amongst researchers and practitioners that there needs to be a common cause to support the rapid implementation of research findings into clinical practice. Harnessing rapid learning research systems and precision medicine models of care together may foster greater stakeholder collaborations, encouraging greater integration between researchers, funders, health systems workers, practitioners, and community partners, focussing on time-pressured, clinically relevant questions [39].",

Rapid research must provide actionable results and scientific rigour, discussed by Rapport and Braithwaite [10] and Peek et al. [52]. To uphold rigour, we need to redefine it to reflect the needs of a range of stakeholders (for example; practitioners, decision-makers, and policy makers), to reflect a more pragmatic approach to research. Peek et al. [52] suggest current conceptions of rigour do not allow for this and limit the range of real-world situations where intervention implementation is feasible. Striking a balance between rigour, rapidity and flexibility of methods and procedures [55] is difficult however to achieve [37, 50].",

            "text": "There is help at hand, however. Multiple implementation science frameworks have increased potential for rapid uptake, such as: the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) [50, 54], My Own Health Report (MOHR) [37], Practical, Robust, Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) [40] and Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) [4, 40]. CFIR was used in the majority of the studies we reviewed [50, 54] and was an indirect focus by one other study [4]. CFIR is focused on components of system change and is intended to be flexible, so that researchers can tailor the framework to the specific intervention design, factors, and context being studied and is useful in guiding rapid-cycle evaluation of the implementation of practice transformation initiatives [50]. Gale et al. [50] carried out a rapid process evaluation guided by CFIR, completed within 12 months. Beck et al. [40] applied PRISM, combining it with RE-AIM components. The combination created a tailored implementation plan for Twenty-First Century well-child care, facilitating the implementation process and improving success in spreading and sustaining care models in paediatric practices. Battaglia and Glasgow [4] discussed RE-AIM as a framework for validating measures of reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance, and raising the importance of sustainability as a key implementation outcome. Other examples applying rapid logic include MOHR [37], a practice-level, cluster randomized pragmatic implementation study designed to develop fast, actionable evidence around the use of patient-reported measures in patient care.",

            "text": "From the foregoing it is clearly important to bridge the gap between research and practice to ensure implementable interventions are current, relevant and applicable to real-time practice \u2013 encouraging uptake and ensuring it becomes established [4, 42, 50]. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are everywhere, but uncertainties exist in how rapid implementation could be addressed by the classic RCT [37, 52, 57]. Presently, evidence indicates that randomized efficacy trials take approximately five and a half years from the initiation of enrolment to publication, and seven years or more after adding in the time from grant application submission to enrolment initiation [53, 58, 61]. In the real-world environment of clinical practice, this time-lag is unacceptable, as well as impractical in a study on, say, a rare disease or the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 [53, 58, 62]. An ethos of rapid implementation can help challenge the current static notion of good science (following a laborious, pipeline efficacy-effectiveness-implementation logic) where too much good science falls behind. The pipeline model suggests efficacy studies precede effectiveness or implementation research, and yet efficacy trials are often not relevant and are sometimes inversely related to those associated with success in later stages [11]. As a result, we often see a \u2018voltage drop\u2019 [4] (reduced fidelity of the intervention when disseminated to other settings), lack of guidance in tailoring interventions to the local context, and all-too-often, inadequate resources being made available for implementation. Clinical trials need to be more pragmatic; open to a range of methods, as necessary, to address a research question [11, 63], and able to address questions that are relevant to the multiple stakeholders involved. Comparing real-world alternatives, such as qualitative trials [10], basket trials or umbrella trials [43] can potentially be used as alternatives to the classic \u2018placebo, no treatment, or control\u2019. Bando [43] indicates, when considering drug testing, that it is important to have a trial design that can efficiently distribute targeted drugs and suggests umbrella and basket designs. Other authors such as Glasgow and Chambers [64] propose a blending of the efficacy and effectiveness stages of intervention development to improve the speed of knowledge creation and increase the usefulness and policy relevance of clinical research. Blending effectiveness and implementation research together has been referred to as the hybrid effectiveness-implementation typology [4, 11, 42]. The idea suggests rapid implementation research designs will hasten the movement of interventions from effectiveness testing through to implementation [62]. As proposed by Raine et al. [57] rapid implementation is moving past the classic large-scale multicentre Randomised Control Trials (RCTs) and towards implementing a broad menu of rapid methods. This evidence adds further support to our findings [10, 42, 43, 59, 60]. Our study should not be viewed as an endpoint, but as increasing understanding of rapid implementation and providing clarity for the next step in our field, that is, placing greater focus on applying and/or adapting rapid methods in implementation science and consideration on what future challenges and opportunities this may present.",

However, by excluding non-English language studies, insights may remain limited. The process of applying the augmented three-phase framework that combined concept analysis with a systematic integrative review resulted in a robust process that enhanced the quality and transparency of the data produced. A clear conceptual definition of rapid implementation is now available and supports international work to implement more rapidly actionable results in clinical practice. Precision medicine is still in its infancy, but it holds the potential to fundamentally alter how evidence-based medicine is practiced and taught. We see the possibilities where rapid implementation meets precision medicine as potentially providing demonstrations needed at the intersection of precision medicine and rapid learning research systems. By way of finalising the discussion, we note the lack of research involving the patient\u2019s voice, as well as the need to involve patients as additional stakeholders in implementation science research generally and particularly within rapid implementation. This points to the need for future research in this area [65].",

There are new methods potentially dislodging current methods; longstanding theories and methods of doing research are being adapted and reconfigured, with many stakeholders (e.g., practitioners, patients, families, decision-makers, administrator and policy makers) recognising the need for faster answers to get results into practice more speedily, thereby negating criticisms of standard implementation delays and the research-practice gap. If it can be made to work, the future of rapid implementation informed by implementation science is bright. It can help efficiently integrate science into practice using contextual and systems perspectives, focusing on adaption, pragmatic trials and mixed methods, and engendering a degree of flexibility in data assessment and interpretation. The key remaining question is how far and fast can we go?",
