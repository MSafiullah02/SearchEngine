This is likely due in part to the increased likelihood of HIV patients being exposed to potential culprit medications such as sulfonamides, but other cases are attributable to the HIV infection itself. Other viruses that may play a role in the pathogenesis of SJS and TEN include enterovirus, adenovirus, measles, mumps, CMV [29], herpes simplex, HHV-6, and influenza [59]. HHV has been recognized as a causative agent for SJS and TEN for several cases in children in particular. Some viral infections have been shown to increase expression ofFas ligand or sensitivity to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis [29], but the importance of Fas ligand expression may have been overestimated, both overall and in virally induced cases of SJS and TEN. Speculation exists that changes to immune cell activity in keratinocytes induced by infection contributes to development of SJS and TEN in these cases. ",

It is not known if the malignancies themselves, disrupted immune function, or exposure to a higher variety of pharmacologic agents is the key variable responsible in this patient cohort [41]. The magnitude of this risk has been estimated to be between two [18] and as much as sixty [70] times that of the patient without any malignancy, but this variance may depend on the patient population examined. Diagnoses of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer (but not hematologic malignancy, lung cancer, or urothelial carcinoma), abnormal labs, and recent or current chemotherapy administration were associated with higher risks of death in a recent review of patients in the UK [68]. A study of patients in the USA found that SJS and TEN were most associated with multiple myeloma, leukemia, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and CNS malignancies [25]. An earlier review of patients at a Roman hospital indicated that CNS malignancy and NHL were the most common malignancies associated with SJS and TEN [23]. ",

A favored theory regarding T-cell activation is termed the prohapten concept. A medication or its metabolite can bind with host protein to form a novel antigen. This antigen is taken up by APCs, which process the protein and then display the resulting peptides on the HLA component of theirMHC for presentation to TCRs on CD8+ or CD4+ T cells. Upon binding of the HLA-novel antigen on the APC to the TCR of the CD4 or CD8+ T cell, the T lymphocyte is induced to replicate and these T cells will target host tissues [31]. Another model is termed the pharmacologic interaction of drugs with the immune system (p-i) concept. In this model, medications or their metabolites noncovalently bond with the type I MHC and TCR, which sets off production of T cells only. This theory could explain the lack of significant B cell populations found in the skin of patients studied with SJS and TEN.",

The process by which responses to stimuli such as infection or malignancy produces memory T-cell production is termed heterologous immunity. However, in many of these cases, it can be challenging to determine if SJS and TEN is occurring in response to the infection or malignancy itself or in response to its treatment. Furthermore, because such a preponderance of cases are due to medications rather than other causes, it is difficult to develop evidence for the mechanistic model by which these other stimuli propagate T-cell proliferation. Studies that reported lack of representative symptoms in CD8+ T-cell-deficient animal models reinforce the central role of cytotoxic T cells but do not elucidate the mechanism of their activation [52].",
