Cessation of elective care with telemedicine implementation in suitable eye conditions further reduces clinic crowding. Active screening of all patients and very limited companions can be instituted via a targeted questionnaire and noncontact temperature check at the clinic or hospital entrance. After check-in, having patients wait in their cars or in open spaces outside the office for cellular phone notification are options, as well as increased spacing between patients in office waiting rooms. For patients with respiratory symptoms or a fever and an urgent or emergent visual symptom, masking the patient, expedient patient movement to the examination room, a prompt focused examination by a provider, and equipment disinfection are critical.",

Recent studies have shown that viral RNA may be observed in association with the small minority of patients who demonstrate conjunctivitis (i.e., <1% of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated conjunctivitis at presentation). Viral RNA has not been identified in the tear film of COVID-19 patients without conjunctivitis to date, but data representing sampling performed early in the disease course when viral load is highest are lacking.14, 15, 16\n",

The N95 respirator is designed with filtration requirements to prevent inhalation of small airborne particles and to minimize leakage from the facial seal.17 As such, it protects the wearer from the inhalation of viral particles. Surgical masks often are fitted loosely but can prevent respiratory droplet transmission and prevent hand-to-face contact. They are considered to be more effective in preventing spread from an infected person wearing the mask to another than in protecting the wearer from infection. In a randomized clinical trial, the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks were found to have comparable outcomes in protection from influenza virus in outpatient settings17; however, N95 respirators are the preferred option when dealing with persons under investigation or COVID-19 patients.",

Within some hospitals in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, standard precautions (e.g., wearing surgical face masks for doctors and patients, routine hand hygiene and washing, temperature screening) are taken for asymptomatic patients. In addition, some hospitals actively prohibit the use of surgical masks by doctors and patients within hospital premises. In Singapore, one nuanced approach involves segregation of all doctors to work in 1 location exclusively. Health personnel are divided further into 2 teams to ensure proper isolation between team members.",

In addition, the mandate to gather evidence during this pandemic that will guide our approach to this, and future outbreaks is clear. After the tragic loss of life and health during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, many countries have used lessons learned to inform their policies during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We must all do the same. As we face the unique, extraordinary challenges of this pandemic, rapid adaptations are required in the United States and around the world.",
