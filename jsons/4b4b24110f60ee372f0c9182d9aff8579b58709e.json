I felt as if I were achieving great things merely by successfully working my way through several of the chapters in this tome. Pto, siology of the Gastrointestinal Tract is an awe-inspiring product--as it should be, and it was a daunting experience for this clinician to browse through it but, as one of my former professors said during an introductory seminar in medicine, \"If you understand all you read, you are reading the wrong books.\" This is the right book! It is the right book for a library or research laboratory; it is the right book for a physiologist or an academically oriented clinician. Anyone who has an interest in a particular problem in physiology will most likely find the answer herein; it may not, however, be readily apparent. Thus, for example, if one wanted to know the recent advances made in understanding hunger and appetite control, the information is found under \"gastric storage, satiety\"--not an imponderable listing, but not too \"user friendly\" either. Certain citations are missing or given short shrift. The physiology of the gastrointestinal tract in aging is covered in just 10 pages while AIDS is not discussed at all, despite severe associated derangements in the intestinal immune system. The gastric circulation is discussed fully, but blood flow of the colon is not mentioned and intestinal blood flow is treated in only nine lines within the enteric neuropeptide chapter. Liver disease is covered only in two chapters on bile acids and the enterohepatic circulation, both by the same expert author (Alan F. Hofmann): one from the hepatobiliary perspective and one from the intestinal viewpoint. Perhaps here then is my most significant critique. While I enjoyed studying the text, and learned a great great deal from each and every section that I read, I found little that was directly applicable to my everyday duties. Rather, I felt as if I were on vacation in a land that spoke a vaguely familiar language, but not one with which I grew up.",

With an estimated one to two million persons having alcoholic cirrhosis in the United States and a scarcity of donor livers limiting the number of liver transplants to about 3000 annually, the potential for patients with alcoholic liver disease to overwhelm the system is substantial. Until recently, a lid was kept on the problem by the perception that results of liver transplantation in patients with alcoholic liver disease were significantly worse than those for patients with nonalcoholic liver disease. However, this conclusion has proved to be erroneous, and several centers have recently reported comparable results in carefully selected patients with alcoholic liver disease and those with nonalcoholic liver disease undergoing liver transplantation.",

In seven concise, beautifully orga-nized, and clearly written chapters, they explore important aspects of alcoholic liver disease as it relates to liver transplantation, including diagnostic difficulties, psychiatric assessment, medical assessment, peritransplant management, psychiatric follow-up, and the ethics of liver transplantation in alcoholics. By focusing on the issue at hand and ignoring related but peripheral matters that can be found in standard textbooks, such as the pathophysiology of alcoholic liver disease, the authors have produced a tightly knit and practical guidebook that can be read easily in an evening and that will be of enormous use to anyone with an interest in alcoholism, liver disease, or liver transplantation.",

Sprinkling his discussion with numerous enlightening case studies and clinical vignettes, he expertly discusses the difference between alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, positive and negative risk factors for abstinence, the value of administering a pledge to an alcoholic, difficulties in confirming abstinence, and the important distinction between denial and ambivalence in the alcoholic's perception of his dependence. These discussions will be particularly enlightening to physicians who focus primarily on the medical aspects of alcoholic liver disease. A chapter by Dr. Lucey provides similarly perceptive insights into the medical aspects of liver transplantation in the alcoholic. He points out, for example, that, despite initial concerns, alcoholic cardiomyopathy has proven to be a less significant problem in patients undergoing liver transplantation than anticipated.",

For example, prophylactic variceal band ligation in patients with varices that have not bled is dismissed, perhaps too hastily, as ineffective by extrapolation of studies of prophylactic variceal sclerotherapy. Nevertheless, one must admire the forthrightness of the authors and their willingness to take a stand and defend it on virtually all relevant issues. Their recommendations are often empirical, though always reasoned. The problem, of course, is that the data base is quite limited. Even with their particular interest in alcoholic liver disease, they report on only 98 transplants in 90 alcoholics, and their principal study on assessing candidacy for liver transplantation is based on only 99 alcoholics, of whom 54 were deemed unsuitable for liver transplantation and in many cases lost to follow-up.",

Endoscopy is becoming only one of several tools made available for the clinician to tackle the complexity of gastrointestinal diseases, and this atlas is a valuable addition to the library of every gastroenterologist.",

If the project is well constructed, it usually takes two to five years to gather the data, perform a careful analysis, write the paper and, finally, see it in print. While molecular biology and other basic research methods have provided understanding of physiology and pathophysiologic processes, therapeutic clinical research must provide the final step in human applications. Funding for clinical research has received short shrift in recent years. In some part, this is probably related to a dearth of well-trained MD researchers. This small offering is based on seminars conducted at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. Its aim is to provide the basic principles of clinical research for those interested in the field. It addresses guidelines on possible conflicts of interest, informed consent, protocol preparation, and research grant applications.

It is a mere 15 years that the first textbook on the exocrine pancreas, by Howat and Arles, was published. Since then, numerous books, monographs, proceedings of meetings and two international journals devoted solely to the pancreas have appeared. The present book, renamed simply The Pancreas, from its former title, The Exocrine Pancreas, is clearly the most comprehensive text on the organ currently available. The addition of a chapter on endocrine-exocrine relationships of the pancreas in the new volume has all but perfected the book, making it impressive in content and range of subjects covered as well as size. Whereas most previous texts have tended to have a clinical bent, the sections in this book relating to the biology of the gland, experimental models, and endocrine-exocrine relationships comprise 729 of the 1137 pages. These include the gross and fine developmental and comparative anatomy of the gland cell and molecular biology, gene expression of protein processing receptors, and electrophysiology of the acinar cells. Hormonal and neural control of enzyme, lithostatine, and mucous secretion are all considered in detail, while experimental procedures encompass not only animal models but the cell and molecular biology of cell injury. Current concepts of the enteroinsular axis, insulin-acinar relationships, \u2022 and the endocrine changes encountered in protein insufficiency are fully explored.",

Both the medical and surgical aspects of pancreatic cancer as well as endocrine tumors are fully considered, and the penultimate chapter on congenital and hereditary diseases are particularly informative as they are rarely considered in detail in more recent books on the pancreas. Needless to say, the editors have chosen authors who are household names in pancreatology with lives steeped in the biochemical or clinical aspects of the gland, and the list of contributors, of which there are 83, is as impressive as the book itself.",

Raven Press, New York, 1994, 294 pp., $131.50 .This excellent book is a summary of the Atlanta International Symposium, the presentations of 40 experts who assembled in Atlanta, Georgia, in the fall of 1992 to discuss acute pancreatitis and its complications. These contributors represented six medical disciplines and 15 countries. About half were pancreatic surgeons. The book is organized based on the Atlanta Classification and divided into sections, such as severe acute pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess, acute pancreatic fluid collection and pseudocysts, and mild acute pancreatitis. Each section has multiple authors. Professor Bradley has most succinctly written the last section, which is the summary.Since each chapter is written by an international expert, there is variability in style and quality. Dogmatic and controversial opinions are evident. The majority of authors are surgeons. These merely reflect the fact that it is basically a symposium proceedings.Many chapters are excellent. These include the chapter on the Atlanta Classification by Bradley, pathology of severe acute pancreatitis by Kloppel, and contrast-enhanced CT by Balthazar. Internists and generalists would benefit from following the concepts put forward by Barkin's group about medical therapy of severe acute pancreatitis. The whole section on the important topic of pancreatic abscess is outstanding. In general, the figures and tables are clear and of high quality.This is a fine monograph on an important topic. It should be of value to generalists as well as specialist in fields such as medicine, surgery, radiology, and emergency medicine--indeed all who encounter patients with acute pancreatitis. It covers all the relevant areas related to acute pancreatitis and so should be purchased by all libraries as a single authoritative reference source.EAPEN THOMAS, MD Johnson City, Tennessee",
