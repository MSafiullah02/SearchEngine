The envelope glycoprotein gp160 is processed by host proteases into the gp120/gp41 heterodimer. This allows the virus to infect target cells following the cell surface binding of the trimeric complex gp120/gp41 to the human CD4 receptor [1], and subsequently to the CXCR4/CCR5 co-receptors [2], [3]. This interaction induces conformational change, which leads to the dissociation of gp120 from gp41, allowing the N-terminal gp41 fusion peptide to be inserted into the host cell membrane [4]. Though the structures of a monomeric gp120 core in complex with the CD4 receptor/Fab 17b [5] and that of a post-fusion form of gp41 were solved [6], little is known about the entire Env conformation. In fact, individually gp120 does not mimic its precursor conformation, as two monoclonal antibodies directed against the V3 loop recognized gp160, but not gp120 [7].",

Since the R511T mutation results in uncleaved gp160 and non-infectious virus, cleavage is essential for viral entry [9]. In vitro investigations on peptides encompassing the gp120/gp41 junction confirmed that cleavage occurs at Arg511\u2193 [10]. Interestingly, upstream of the physiological processing site, a second site2 potential furin motif (KAKR503) is inefficiently cleaved. The exact role of site2 is unknown, though mutations of gp160 KAKR503 sequence result in an unprocessed precursor [11]. Conformational differences between site1 and site2 may explain the preference of furin for site1\n[12].",

This suggests that gp160 structure [11], [13], post-translational modifications [14], as well as cellular and/or extracellular factors, may also influence the efficacy and selectivity of the furin mediated cleavage [15]. Viruses, such as Sindbis [16] and coronavirus [17], bind to target cells via cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Proteoglycans were also shown to facilitate HIV-1 binding to and/or entry into cells lacking the CD4 receptor [18]. Moreover, enzymatic removal of cell surface heparan sulfate chains drastically impairs HIV-1 infection of CD4+ cells [19]. This effect likely implicates gp160 and/or gp120 interaction with GAGs [20], [21], [22]. Many authors identified the binding site for heparin or its derivatives within the gp120 V3 loop [21]. However, an increasing body of evidence points to a possible gp160\u2013GAGs interaction [22].",

Furthermore, cleavage was inhibited by adding a well known PC-inhibitor, dec-RVKR-cmk (Fig. 6, upper right panel) [23].

The lack of processing at site2 may be rationalized on the basis of structural motifs. In fact, the 19mer NMR molecular model in TFE revealed that site2 is embedded in a helical segment, whereas site1 is in a exposed loop at the C-terminus of the peptide [12]. In contrast, the 41mer and 51mer, spanning extensive sequence of the gp160 cleavage region, were shown to represent very poor furin substrates.

            "text": "Therefore, we suspected that cellular/extracellular factors may influence the cleavability of gp160 by furin. Indeed, surface proteins containing heparin-binding motifs processed by furin were reported [16], [26]. In particular, Sindbis virus attachment to target cells was enhanced in the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) via the furin recognition motif of the unprocessed envelope glycoprotein PE2 [16]. Similarly, peptides derived from the cleavage site of the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion glycoprotein bind heparin and cellular GAGs [26]. Since the gp120/gp41 does not form stable trimers, while unprocessed gp160 does, it was hypothesized that gp160 oligomer attachment to the plasma membrane heparin sulfate occurs via its furin cleavage site [27]. Indeed, the KAKR\n503\nRVVQREKR\n511 sequence exhibits a basic region, which contains two potential inverted consensus HS-binding domains. Thus, it was shown that the affinity of gp160 for heparin is about 3-times higher than that observed for gp120, implying that gp41 and/or hidden motifs in the mature gp120 may be involved in heparin binding [22].",

In fact, in presence of heparin, the profiles change with respect to those of the peptides alone. The negative band at 198 nm, diagnostic for aperiodic structures, is replaced by a positive one. In contrast, it is noteworthy that the shorter 19mer does not change its CD profile in the presence of heparin. Since the difference between the 41mer and the 19mer lies in 22 hydrophobic residues and the interaction between heparin and polypeptides is supposed to be electrostatic, these additional residues may support a favorable peptide conformation that optimally orients the positively charged side chains towards the negatively charged sulfate moieties. Our results agree with a probable glycosaminoglycans-gp160 interaction, as proposed [22], [27], and suggest that the residues spanning the gp120/gp41 junction may contribute in gp160-GAGs binding.",

Heparin was shown to strongly interact with the 41mer and 51mer peptides, inducing conformational changes, thereby exposing site1 for cleavage. Since the 41mer and 51mer peptides may not faithfully mimic the conformation around the cleavage site within the complete gp160 precursor, more analyses are required to assess if heparin is essential in vivo during gp160 maturation and how GAGs modulate HIV-1 activity.",
