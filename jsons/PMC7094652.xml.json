However, extensive studies suggest that the mechanisms of liver injury in viral hepatitis are due to the host immune responses, but not to the direct cytopathic effects of viruses. The direct killing of infected cells by virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is considered as the central mechanism resulting in both liver damage and virus control. In addition, CD4+ T helper response is also found to have a strong association with viral clearance in the acute phase of hepatitis [4].",

In mice, DN Treg cells could kill activated CD8+ T cells with the same TCR specificity, and infusion of in vitro-activated DN Treg cells led to significant prolongation of donor-specific skin and heart graft survival [17], [25], [26], [27]. Recently, increasing attention has been focused on these novel Treg cells. Crisp\u00edn et al. demonstrated that DN T cells produce IL-17/IFN-\u03b3 and contribute to the pathogenesis of kidney damage in patients with SLE [28]. Another study showed that DN T splenic cells from young NOD mice could provide long-lasting protection against type 1 diabetes [29]. In SIV-induced CD4+ T cell depletion in sooty mangabeys which do not present immune dysfunction and clinical AIDS, DN T cells partially compensates for CD4+ T cell function in these animals [30]. In cutaneous leishmaniasis infection, TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ DNT cells present an increased bias in their capacity to induce inflammatory immune responses, and TCR\u03b3\u03b4+ DNT cells show a regulatory profile [31].",

The majority of DN T cells expressed TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ while only a small part expressed TCR\u03b3\u03b4+. Adhesion molecule CD44 was highly expressed on DN T cells, while activation markers CD25, CD28 or CD30 were rarely detected. Moreover, these DN T cells did not recognize \u03b1\u2212Galcer (which NKT cells do in an Ag-specific fashion), demonstrating that DN T cells are different from NKT cells (data not shown). Intracellular cytokines of DN T cells were detected on Day 0, 6, 10, 15, 20, and 30 after MHV-3 infection. The infected DN T cells either producing IL-2 or IFN-\u03b3 have increased since day 7 after MHV-3 infection, peaked at day 15 and maintained a stable level hence. Only marginal levels of IL-4, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, perforin and granzyme B were detected, and there was no significant difference between infected and non-infected mice in the expression of these intracellular cytokines at any time points (Fig. 4B, C, D).",

MHV-3 belongs to the coronavirus family and has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. As reported, susceptible inbred mouse strains such as Balb/cJ or C57BL/6 develop fulminant hepatitis and die within 3\u20135 days following peritoneal inoculation of the virus. In contrast, A/J mice are resistant and develop no clinical signs of hepatitis, and clear the virus within 10 days of infection [41]. C3H/HeJ mouse, a semisusceptible mouse strain develops acute hepatitis which progresses to mild chronic hepatitis [42]. In our study, the mice have presented acute inflammation from 6 to 15 days after infection, and a proportion of the infected mice died. However, after this phase, the liver injury in the survived mice was alleviated, accompanied with the recovery of the liver function. Only mild inflammation has been observed in the livers of the survivors, with persistent low-level virus replication, suggesting the persistence of viral infection. Since the disease course, histopathology, and serum biochemical changes observed in the mouse model are similar to those observed in patients with chronic viral hepatitis, this mouse model could be useful to understand the pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis in humans.",

In order to better understand the mechanisms leading to virus persistence in the model of MHV-3 infected C3H/HeJ mice, we studied the variations of different subgroups of T cells in C3H/HeJ mice after MHV-3 infection. The results showed that the frequency of DN T cells rose significantly in blood, liver, and spleen after MHV-3 infection. We also observed an increase of CD4+CD25+ Tregs (data not shown) in the liver, but the increase of DN T cells was more pronounced than the increase of CD4+CD25+ Tregs, indicating that DN T cells might play a critical role in controlling the pathogenesis of the disease.",

However, differences in the virus titers of liver tissue had barely been observed between DN T group and control groups.

Since the virus-specific CD8+ T cells play a key role in causing liver damage, this result made a sensible explanation to the survival increase and improvement of liver histology in recipient mice in adoptive transfer experiment. Transwell experiments indicated that cell\u2013cell contact is necessary to the cytotoxicity mediated by DN T cells. Moreover, the Fas/FasL pathway instead of perforin/granzyme pathway plays a vital part in DN T cell killing. Thus we presume that, in MHV-3 infected C3H mice, DN T cells rapidly proliferated following the development of liver inflammation, and contributed to the control of liver injury by killing the virus-specific CD8+ T cells. The phenomenon observed here is in agreement with what has been described for TCR\u03b1\u03b2+ CD25+CD30+ DN T cells, which are able to prevent the rejection of skin and heart allografts by specifically inhibiting CD8+ T cells through Fas-FasL interaction [17]. However, Zhang et al. reported that B220+CD25+ DN T cells can control B and T cell responses in perforin/granzyme-dependent mechanisms [25]. Voelkl also reported that human DN Tregs do not eliminate effector T cells by Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis, but to suppress by an active cell contact-dependent mechanism [44]. Thus, it seems that the functions of DN Tregs change in accordance with the different phenotypes in specific settings.",

Meanwhile, these DN T cells showed a relatively increased production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, but low IL-4, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1. It is reported that, in other disease models, DN T cells with different phenotypes present different cytokine profiles. In autoimmune diseases like SLE, TCR\u03b1\u03b2+TCRV\u03b124\u2212 DN T cells are the major producers of IL-17, one of the key inflammatory cytokine involved in SLE. And the results suggested that these DN T cells contribute to the pathogenesis of kidney damage in patients with SLE [28]. In CD4-low mangabeys, DN T cells have increased expression of IFN-\u03b3(Th1), IL-4(Th2) and IL-17(Th17), suggesting these cells may be capable of performing multiple functions, including CD4 helper\u2013like function and regulatory function. And the latter could potentially contribute to controlling immune activation during nonpathogenic SIV infection [30]. In our study, we assume that the DN T cells may, to some degree, exert the role of Th1 cells, which promote viral elimination. Nevertheless, the limited quantity of these cytokines constrained their power for viral clearance and allowed the low-level viral persistence. We postulate that it was the delicate balance of multiple effects of DN T cells contributing to the viral persistence in this model.",
