Its dynamic spread has prompted authorities to introduce a broad variety of measures, and has mobilized resources on a heretofore unprecedented scale, as well as attracted wide attention among experts, politicians, and the general public [3] . In planning the measures and resources, it is crucial that timely and reliable data are available on the current prevalence of the disease, and -more pertinently to the present contribution -on its future course [4, 5] . Forecasts of the future course of the disease, as expressed through the trajectory of cases (and, ideally, their severity), are essential in the planning of the extent and nature of epidemic response. Further, given the enormous and widespread interest in the topic, such data should be amenable to online presentation, in a form that is both visually attractive and easy to assimilate by non-epidemiologists.",

At the time of this writing, it is still often unclear which is the case [6] ); testing policy is subject to change with respect to both testing intensity and selection of tested individuals; the sensitivity and specificity of early tests is not well known as there is no reliable gold standard; and, tests may vary markedly on these parameters.",

We apply this model to predict the future course of confirmed cases in a number of countries, and present the results in a modern, interactive online dashboard, updated daily and accessible to the public. The approach includes a robust, real-time validation procedure which consists in replicating past projections and comparing them with actual observed data (see Subsection 2.3). Unlike in most compartmental (SIR, SEIR, and further extensions) approaches [7] [8] [9] , our models do not require prior estimation of the usual epidemic pathogen-specific parameters (R 0 , incubation period), which presents a particular challenge for emerging pathogens and diseases, such as the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 [5, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Further, our approach can be easily applied to levels other than country (e.g. state, county, province), and to data other than confirmed cases (e.g. deaths, hospitalizations, or severe cases). Details of the approach are set out in Section 2. In Section 3, we shall proceed to explain actual forecasts for selected countries.",

To answer the question as to which of the three scenarios is more likely for a given country, it is helpful to examine the percentage errors of the three forecasts. Figs 1-2 give the statistical characteristics of forecast errors for the three Models. Percentage errors are computed for forecasts starting ten days back, that is starting on May 4, 2020. Our box plots (Figs 1-2) indicate the range of the errors, as well as the under-or overestimation of the cumulative confirmed cases. For instance, we see that for the US, Germany, United Kingdom, and Poland, all three models tend towards underestimation, which would suggest a pessimistic scenario. By contrast, we see some overestimation for Mexico, which suggests a more optimistic scenario given by Models 2 and 3. Yet another group of cases are Sweden and Turkey, where Model 1 overestimates, and Models 2 and 3 underestimate; here, it is hard to pick the more likely scenario. Table 2 gives the mean absolute percentage forecast errors (MAPE) for each of the forecast days 1, 2, . . . , 7, separately and jointly (1-7) . The heat map version of the table lets the reader see at a glance which country projections are the most and least accurate. In most cases, it is Model 3 that yields best weekly forecasts. This follows from the fact that Model 3 has, by definition, 100% accuracy on the day of the forecast. We should stress that the three models presented here are characterized by the same Eq (5), and May 19, 2020 5/12",
