            "text": "Cytokines are signaling molecules for intercellular communication such as the induction of immune responses by recruiting immune cells and regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. During viral infection, cytokines play a central role in the innate and adaptive immunity. For example, both Type I and II interferons (IFNs), and various interleukins (ILs) play crucial roles in the control of viral replication at the early stage of virus infection. The innate cytokines are also important in the induction of adaptive immunity specific to the infecting virus by inducing inflammation responses. The excessive inflammation due to viral infection-mediated cytokine production may also lead to immunopathic conditions and pathogenicity of the viral infections. Because of the important role that cytokines play in the immune response, cytokines have been studied for their application in therapeutic treatment and in vaccine formulations (Andersson and Tracey, 2011, Heegaard et al., 2011, Leong et al., 1994). However, since cytokines have a short half-life and require large dose administration systemically in order to be fully functional, new methods to deliver cytokines to the site of infection have been developed, including the creation of chimeric molecules, delivery vehicles, and the use of viral vectors to express cytokines (Ahlers et al., 2003, Yilma et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a small-enveloped virus containing a single positive-stranded RNA genome. PRRSV is classified in the Order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). Nucleotide sequence comparisons show that PRRSV can be divided into distinct European (Type I) and North American (Type II) genotypes, possessing only about 63% nucleotide identity at the genomic level (Allende et al., 1999, Nelsen et al., 1999). PRRSV causes mild to severe respiratory disease in infected newborn and growing swine, and reproductive failure in pregnant sows (Rossow et al., 1995, Rossow, 1998). PRRSV infection stimulates a minimal level of innate cytokine production. The inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8, have been detected in virus-infected pigs (Aasted et al., 2002, Suradhat et al., 2003, Suradhat and Thanawongnuwech, 2003, Thanawongnuwech and Thacker, 2003, Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004, Thanawongnuwech et al., 2004, Lunney et al., 2010). However, in comparison to the other strong immunogenic swine pathogens, such as swine influenza virus and pseudorabies virus, the quantities of secreted cytokines appeared to be much lower. It is suggested that such poor innate anti-viral IFN and cytokine responses result in a weak adaptive immune response.",

            "text": "There are still no therapeutic drugs or completely effective vaccines to control PRRSV. Currently available modified live vaccines have shown the most promising efficacy but have only been partially successful in protection against a wide array of heterologous PRRSV isolates in the field (B\u00f8tner et al., 1997, Mengeling, 2005). In the effort of new vaccine development, cytokines have been evaluated as adjuvants during the immunization of animals (Zuckermann et al., 1998, Zuckermann et al., 1999, Somasundaram et al., 1999, Foss et al., 2002, Murtaugh et al., 2002, Boyaka et al., 2003, Petrovsky and Aguilar, 2004, Royaee et al., 2004). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent inflammatory mediator in response to infection. IL-1\u03b2 has been tested as an immunological adjuvant because of its ability to influence a broad spectrum of biological activities within the immune system. It was reported that co-administration of recombinant bovine IL-1\u03b2 and a modified live BHV-1 vaccine was able to enhance both the humoral and cellular immune response against BHV-1 (Reddy et al., 1990, Reddy et al., 1993). A recombinant BHV-1 expressing bovine IL-1\u03b2 showed that both cellular and secreted forms of recombinant IL-1\u03b2 possessed biological activity, and the expression of IL-1\u03b2 protein did not affect the in vitro growth efficiency of the virus (Raggo et al., 1996). In this study, we explored the strategy of manipulating the immunogenic properties of a virus by expression of a swine IL-1\u03b2 (swIL1\u03b2) protein using a PRRSV reverse genetic system. A recombinant PRRSV, designated vP129/swIL1\u03b2, was generated. This recombinant virus was further tested in a nursery pig model to determine whether swine IL-1\u03b2 could be successfully delivered in vivo. The effect of in vivo expression of swine IL-1\u03b2 on the pathogenic property of the virus as well as the PRRSV specific immune response was further examined.",

These results indicate that the insertion of swine IL-1\u03b2 into the viral genome does not affect the viral replication in vitro.",

The clinical signs and body temperature were monitored during the first five days post-inoculation. As shown in Table 1\n, all pigs inoculated by parental virus developed clinical signs, showing respiratory distress (coughing, serious nasal discharge) and lethargy, and four pigs had rectal temperatures over 40 \u00b0C during the second and third day post-inoculation. In contrast, no apparent clinical signs were observed in those pigs inoculated by vP129/swIL1\u03b2 virus, and rectal temperature was normal for this group of pigs through the time course of the study. All pigs given virus became infected, which was evident by in vitro virus isolation and positive real-time PCR results for the presence of viral RNA in serum. Viral load in serum peaked at 7 dpi (Fig. 3A) for both vP129/swIL1\u03b2 and parental virus infected groups. Statistically, there was no significant difference in viral load between these two groups, although a slightly lower level of viral load in serum samples from those pigs infected with wild type virus was observed at 14, 21 and 28 dpi. Interestingly, in comparison to the group of pigs infected with wild type virus, a higher level of viral load was observed in the lymph nodes, tonsil and lung tissues from those pigs infected with vP129/swIL1\u03b2 at 28 dpi (Fig. 3B). At necropsy (28 dpi), minimal lung lesions (Table 1) were observed in vP129 and vP129/swIL1\u03b2 infected groups. Enlarged mandibular lymph nodes were observed in three of the pigs from the vP129/swIL1\u03b2 infected group, and in two of the pigs from the vP129 infected group.",

The results confirmed that the swIL1\u03b2 gene remained intact as a full-length gene.

In an earlier study, swIL1\u03b2 was detected in sera or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (by the fluorescent microsphere immunoassay, FMIA) from PRRSV-infected pigs (Lawson et al., 2010). To compare with these earlier findings, samples were collected from control and virus-infected pigs at 3, 7 and 14 dpi. PBMCs were stimulated in vitro with parental virus, PHA, or medium for 24 h. The FMIA results showed that higher levels of swIL1\u03b2 protein were expressed in PBMCs from pigs infected by PRRSV, either vP129/swIL1\u03b2 or parental vP129 compared to control pigs at 3, 7 and 14 dpi (Fig. 4\n). The comparison between vP129/swIL1\u03b2 and parental vP129 showed that a higher level of swIL1\u03b2 protein was expressed in pigs infected by vP129/swIL1\u03b2 at 14 dpi (Fig. 4). No significant difference in swIL1\u03b2 protein expression was detected from both groups of pigs infected by vP129/swIL1\u03b2 and parental virus at 3 and 7 dpi by the FMIA. Interestingly, no detectable level of swIL1\u03b2 was observed in serum samples from all groups of pigs at 3, 7 and 14 dpi (data not shown). We further monitored the temporal expression of selected innate and cellular immune proteins in PBMCs from virus-infected pigs using FMIA. As shown in Fig. 4, besides IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 expression levels were also significantly higher in pigs infected with vP129/swIL1\u03b2 compared to pigs with vP129 at 14 dpi. A significantly higher level of IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1 was also observed in vP129/swIL1\u03b2 infected pigs compared to pigs with vP129 at 14 dpi. IL-8 and IL-12 expression were higher at an early time point (3 dpi) but lower at 7 dpi in vP129/swIL1\u03b2 infected pigs compared to pigs infected with vP129. The expression of IL-10 was lower at an early time point (3 dpi) but was higher at 7 dpi in vP129/swIL1\u03b2 infected pigs compared to pigs infected with vP129. The comparison between virus infected groups (either vP129/swIL1\u03b2 or parental vP129) and the control group showed that the expression of IL-12 or IL-10 in PBMCs was either up- or down-regulated by virus infection at 3 and 14 dpi.",

            "text": "PRRSV infection appears to elicit poor innate IFN and cytokine responses unlike the other strongly immunogenic viral pathogens. Its effects result in a weak adaptive immune response as demonstrated by prolonged viremia, short duration of cell-mediated immune responses and slow development of virus-specific IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells. Anti-PRRSV neutralizing antibodies are generated slowly and their titers remain low. There is an extensive body of literature describing the innate interferon and cytokine effect on PRRSV replication and cytokine-mediated events that occur during PRRSV infection. In an earlier study, inoculation of pigs with porcine respiratory coronavirus, a potent inducer of innate cytokines, provided protection from a subsequent PRRSV infection (Buddaert et al., 1998). Overend et al. (2007) showed that recombinant swine IFN-\u03b2 protects swine alveolar macrophages from infection with PRRSV. Royaee et al. (2004) showed that using an expression plasmid encoding porcine IFN-\u03b1 as an adjuvant resulted in a temporary increase in the frequency of PRRSV specific IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells in the vaccinated animals. These results all support an important role of IFNs and cytokines in the initial innate immune response and the subsequent activation of adaptive immunity. However, with PRRSV infection, innate immune genes and proteins expression is suppressed and delayed (Van Reeth et al., 1999, Van Reeth et al., 2002, Murtaugh et al., 2002). This initial suppression of the innate immune response, leading to the delayed induction of protective cellular and humoral immunity, provides a window of time that allows PRRSV to replicate, shed and transmit to other contact na\u00efve animals. Therefore, current strategies for vaccine development are directed at constructing a PRRS vaccine capable of inducing a high level of innate and cellular immune responses and robust neutralizing antibody activity within a short period of time after vaccination.",

            "text": "The use of cytokines as adjuvants for enhancing the viral specific immune response has been investigated in both subunit and modified live vaccines (Heath and Playfair, 1992, Gao et al., 1995, Godson et al., 1995, Ahlers et al., 2003, Yilma et al., 2010, Heegaard et al., 2011). In particular, IL-1\u03b2 has been tested as a potent immune modulator in vaccine development. The recombinant bovine IL-1\u03b2 has been tested as an adjuvant to co-administrate with a modified live BHV-1 vaccine, and an in vivo study showed enhanced humoral and cellular immune response. Although the study demonstrated the effect of IL-1\u03b2 on the enhancement of host immunity, the systemic administration of IL-1\u03b2 to develop an adjuvant effect requires a large dose of recombinant IL-1\u03b2 and multiple injections at a local site. This could result in severe side effects and is not cost-effective in veterinary medicine. The use of recombinant virus as a vector to express the cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, has the potential to overcome these drawbacks. The viral vector system allows delivery of the cytokine to the specific site of infection. It reduces the dose requirement and thereby decreases the cost and side effects. A number of cytokines have been tested by inserting into recombinant viruses (Bembridge et al., 1998, Karaca et al., 1998, Giavedoni et al., 1997, Leong et al., 1994, Flexner et al., 1990). For example, expression of IFN-\u03b3 by recombinant respiratory syncytial virus attenuated the virus in vivo and protected animals from subsequent challenge with wild type virus (Bukreyev et al., 1999). In vaccinia virus, expression of IL-2 attenuated the virus while maintained the immunogenicity in vivo (Flexner et al., 1990). In our study, a recombinant PRRSV (vP129/swIL1\u03b2) was constructed, which expresses the IL-1\u03b2 gene as a separate mRNA from an additional transcriptional product placed between ORF1b and ORF2 genome region. The recombinant virus produced high levels of IL-1\u03b2 protein in cell culture. In vitro growth kinetics analysis indicated that the production of swIL1\u03b2 was not toxic to the cells and did not affect viral replication. In comparison to the parental virus, the vP129/swIL1\u03b2 virus grew to a viral titer similar to that of the parental virus in MARC-145 cells. This property is important for recombinant vaccine development. Genetic manipulation/attenuation of the live virus are typically accompanied by reduced viral titer. However, to achieve a satisfactory level of immunogenicity, the virus titer must be adequately maintained. The ability to produce high titers of vP129/swIL1\u03b2 virus in vitro makes it easy to produce sufficient quantities for large-scale vaccine production. In addition, the large amount of recombinant IL-1\u03b2 protein produced by the recombinant virus could be an alternative method for the in vitro production of recombinant cytokines.",

First, the expression of IL-1\u03b2 by vP129/swIL1\u03b2 did not show a difference in viral load in the sera compared to those by the parental virus in animals. Also, our data showed that the IL-1\u03b2 gene is maintained in the virus isolated from serum samples of the vP129/swIL1\u03b2 infected pigs. Most importantly, the in vivo co-expression of swIL1\u03b2 attenuated the pathogenic property of the virus. The parental virus P129 is known to be a highly pathogenic virus (Calvert et al., 2002, Calvert et al., 2003). Results from our study demonstrated that parental P129 virus infected pigs showed significant symptoms of lethargy and respiratory distress. In contrast, the swIL1\u03b2 expressing vP129/swIL1\u03b2 virus infected pigs did not show apparent clinical symptoms. It is not clear why the expression of IL-1\u03b2 by vP129/swIL1\u03b2 resulted in attenuated symptoms in the animals. Initially, we hypothesized that vP129/swIL1\u03b2 might be more virulent than the parental virus because of the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2. It is possible that the attenuation may be related to the site (alveolar region) of virus replication and the expression of the cytokine where the anti-inflammatory mechanism is strong (Spight et al., 2005). Another interesting phenomenon related to this is that although the viral load in blood was similar, a higher level of viral load in tissues (tonsil, lymph nodes, and lung) was observed in pigs infected with vP129/swIL1\u03b2 at 28 dpi. In this case, the viral load at the local tissues did not correlate with the disease progression, since the vP129/swIL1\u03b2 infected pigs did not develop apparent clinical symptoms and no significant lung lesion was observed. It is possible that the continued expression of IL-1\u03b2 in virus infected cells may promote virus replication by recruiting monocytes to differentiate into macrophages in the local tissues. Currently, we are investigating the potential mechanism of the attenuation by IL-1\u03b2 in virus-infected animals.",

Further analysis of a time course pattern of cytokine proteins expression using a FMIA suggested that the co-expression of IL-1\u03b2 could lead to a strong T cell response. In comparison to the parental virus, infection with vP129/swIL1\u03b2 resulted in a significant increase of both Th1 marker (IFN-\u03b3) and Th2 marker (IL-4) in PBMCs at 14 dpi. The result of the humoral immune response showed that both vP129/swIL1\u03b2 and parental virus infected groups had seroconverted by 14 dpi at the same levels (Fig. 5A). However, a higher level of neutralizing antibody response was observed in the group of pigs infected with vP129/swIL1\u03b2 compared to that with parental virus at 28 dpi (Fig. 5B), which may be due to the strong T cell response by vP129/swIL1\u03b2.",
