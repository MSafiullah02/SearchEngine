The tiny absorption peak at 260 nm was attributed to \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition. The Gly\u2010CDs possessed a significant characteristic blue fluorescence at 438 nm, with the maximal excitation wavelength remaining at 356 nm. Meanwhile, excitation\u2010dependent fluorescence emission was observed when Gly\u2010CDs were excited with different wavelengths from 300 to 410 nm(Figure 1e), due to the normal size distribution of Gly\u2010CDs.50 The UV\u2013vis absorption spectrum and fluorescence spectrum are all consistent with CDs reported before.49, 51 Figure 1f shows the Gly\u2010CDs functional groups measured by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT\u2010IR). In the spectra of Gly\u2010CDs, five obvious absorption peaks could be observed at 3430, 2947, 1621, 1408, and 1051 cm\u22121, corresponding, respectively, to O\u2014H, C\u2014H, C = C, C = O, and C\u2014O, indicating that Gly\u2010CDs are rich in \u2014OH and \u2014COOH on the surface.52 The results obtained from the preliminary analysis of the FT\u2010IR spectrum proved that the Gly\u2010CDs conserved part functional groups of glycyrrhizic acid. The elemental constituents and functional groups of Gly\u2010CDs were further characterized by X\u2010ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure 1g shows the full\u2010scan spectrum of Gly\u2010CDs. The two peaks of C 1s and O 1s could be obviously recognized at 285 and 532 eV, respectively. The elemental analysis demonstrated that Gly\u2010CDs contained 78.25% of carbon and 21.48% of oxygen. The high resolution XPS spectra of the C1s in Gly\u2010CDs could be resolved into three peaks (Figure 1h). The peak at 284.5 eV was assigned to C = O of the carboxylic groups, while the other two peaks at 286.5 and 288.2 eV were ascribed, respectively, to C\u2014O and C\u2014C/C = C.53, 54\n",

Whether Gly\u2010CDs can directly inactivate PRRSV was first tested. As shown in Figure\n\n4\na, Gly\u2010CDs reduced the number of PRRSV by \u224810\u2010fold by plaque assay, indicating that Gly\u2010CDs can directly inactivate PRRSV. In the adsorption process of PRRSV, the plaque assay showed no significant difference in the experimental group and control group about their suppression effect on PRRSV adsorption (Figure 4b). In the invasion process of PRRSV, the experimental data revealed that the Gly\u2010CDs treatment decreased the infectious virus titer by about 103\u2010fold relative to the control group (Figure 4c), implying that Gly\u2010CDs may suppress PRRSV mainly through inhibiting PRRSV invasion. The influence of Gly\u2010CDs on viral replication was evaluated by real\u2010time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2010qPCR) analysis of the negative\u2010sense RNA level of PRRSV. As shown in Figure 4d, Gly\u2010CDs reduced the number of PRRSV RNA copies by nearly 10\u2010fold, revealing their slight influence on PRRSV at the replication stage. Moreover, the effect of Gly\u2010CDs on the release of progeny PRRSV was examined. In Figure 4e,f, no noticeable difference was observed in the virus titers of both intracellular and supernatant PRRSV between the experimental group and control group, suggesting that Gly\u2010CDs had no inhibitory effect on the release of progeny PRRSV. Taken together, Gly\u2010CDs suppress PRRSV proliferation by targeting the invasion and replication processes, with a certain direct inactivation effect in vitro as indicated by statistical analysis, but without any inhibitory effect on the adsorption and release of progeny virus.",

Proteomics technology can identify the structural functions and expression levels of specific proteins in sample tissues, understand the pathogenic mechanisms, and alter the expression patterns of different proteins.82 Thus, iTRAQ proteomic analysis was used to evaluate the differential protein expression in cells after treatment with Gly\u2010CDs as well as the functions of these differential proteins. Based on proteomics data, the action mechanism of Gly\u2010CDs on PRRSV proliferation was explored by some cellular responses from MARC\u2010145 cells induced by Gly\u2010CDs. This means that Gly\u2010CDs can stimulate cells to regulate the expression of some host restriction factors, including DDX53 and NOS3, which have an important role in the subsequent cell infection by PRRSV.",

Additionally, previous studies have reported the side effects of glycyrrhizic acid, such as hypokalemia, edema, and thrombocytopenia.83 The Gly\u2010CDs have higher biocompatibility, and theoretically, they can reduce the side effects of glycyrrhizic acid. However, whether the Gly\u2010CDs exhibit stronger antiviral activity in vivo and reduce the side effects of glycyrrhizic acid still needs further study in the host (pig) of PRRSV.",

The chemical characterization demonstrated that Gly\u2010CDs have high dispersibility, small size, and other properties. Biological experiments indicated that Gly\u2010CDs have excellent antiviral activity against PRRSV (\u22485 orders of magnitude). The antiviral mechanism of Gly\u2010CDs was demonstrated from inactivation of PRRSV in vitro, inhibition of PRRSV invasion and replication, stimulation of cells to produce interferon, inhibition of ROS production induced by PRRSV infection.

NaOH (AR), ethylenediamine (AR), and citric acid (AR) were obtained from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All reagents were directly used without further purification. All solutions were prepared with deionized water from a Millipore water purification system. Briefly, the Gly\u2010CDs were synthesized with a modified one\u2010pot hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis route, 0.10 g (0.12 mmol) glycyrrhizic acid was dissolved in 10 mL deionized water, followed by adding dropwise saturated NaOH aqueous solution to adjust the pH to 10.0 \u00b1 0.2, transferring the mixture into a 25 mL Teflon\u2010lined autoclave and incubation at 180 \u00b0C for 7 h (Gly\u2010CDs). After cooling to room temperature naturally, large precipitate was removed from the mixture by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min, followed by collecting the supernatant and filtering through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter to further remove small precipitate. Finally, the Gly\u2010CDs were obtained by dialysis against deionized water for 8 h with a cut\u2010off molecular weight 14 kDa dialysis bag, with the deionized water being changed every 2 h during dialysis. The Gly\u2010CDs powders were then collected and freeze\u2010dried for further usage. The quantum yield of the Gly\u2010CDs was measured to be 1.41%, using quinine sulfate as reference.",
