Nevertheless, many factors that promote transmission across the vaginal mucosa probably also enhance transmission across the gastrointestinal mucosa (Table 1).For example, infectiousness, defined as the probability of transmitting HIV-1 from one person to another, is greatest when the index partner has primary HIV-1 infection, which corresponds to the period of infection between exposure to the virus and development of circulating anti\u2013HIV-1 antibodies.9 Primary infection is associated with the highest plasma levels of HIV-1.10, 11 Although the levels of HIV-1 in genital secretions during primary infection have not been reported, virus has been detected in genital secretions in all stages of disease. Thus, the presence of cell-free and cell-associated virus in genital secretions probably contributes to its increased infectiousness during this stage of the disease.12\n",

Normally, an intact mucosa prevents mucosal penetration of many luminal pathogens. In persons at risk for HIV-1 infection, trauma-induced disruption of the rectal mucosa provides inoculated virus direct access to the mucosal microcirculation and contributes to the high rate of HIV-1 transmission in receptive anal intercourse. Similarly, infection-associated mucosal inflammation and erosions probably provide virus access to lymphoid cells in the lamina propria. Supporting the latter notion are clinical observations that certain gastrointestinal tract infections that cause mucosal ulcers or deep erosions, including herpes simplex proctitis and syphilis, are associated with higher rates of HIV-1 transmission. In addition, certain mucosal infections enhance the susceptibility of lymphoid cells to HIV-1 infection. For example, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) enhances macrophage expression of CCR5, the chemokine coreceptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1, and up-regulates HIV-1 expression by macrophages coinfected with MAC and HIV-1.24\n",

A recent study of the mucosal translocation of HIV-1 using epithelial cell lines showed that the virus could be translocated across a tight epithelial cell monolayer by a transcytotic pathway.45 However, the phenotype of epithelial tumor cell lines differs from that of primary intestinal epithelial cells. Therefore, using a modification of the technique that we developed to isolate and purify human intestinal macrophages and lymphocytes,46 we purified human intestinal epithelial cells and studied their HIV-1 receptor and coreceptor expression.47 Primary intestinal epithelial cells expressed galactosyl ceramide (GalCer), an alternative primary receptor for HIV-1 on neural48 and epithelial lines.45, 49 In addition, the primary intestinal epithelial cells expressed CCR5, the coreceptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates (referred to as R5 viruses because they use CCR5 for cell entry).47 In contrast to their expression of CCR5, primary intestinal epithelial cells did not express CXCR4, the chemokine coreceptor for lymphocyte-tropic HIV-1 isolates (referred to as X4 viruses because they use CXCR4 for entry), or CD4, the primary receptor for HIV-1 on mononuclear cells. This GalCer+CCR5+CXCR4\u2212 phenotype distinguishes primary intestinal epithelial cells from epithelial cell lines and indicates that cells equipped for the selection and uptake of R5 HIV-1 are present in the upper gastrointestinal tract mucosa. The phenotype of purified rectal epithelial cells has not yet been reported, although immunohistochemical staining of colon biopsy specimens suggests that CXCR4 may be present on rectal epithelium,50, 51 indicating that intestinal epithelium may differ from colonic epithelium in coreceptor expression.",

Because most HIV-1 infections are acquired across a mucosal surface, mucosal cells could conceivably select the R5 viruses that are initially acquired by the recipient from the mixture of HIV-1 viruses inoculated onto the mucosa by a chronically infected donor. Having shown that intestinal epithelial cells express CCR5, but not CXCR4, we investigated whether the cells could selectively transfer R5 HIV-1 to target cells. We found that intestinal epithelial cells selected and transferred R5, but not X4, HIV-1 to CCR5+ target cells, which replicated and amplified virus expression.47 In addition, our studies supported Bomsel's observation in cell lines that HIV-1 transfer was accomplished by microtubule-dependent transcytosis. Our finding that CCR5+ intestinal epithelial cells select and transfer exclusively R5 viruses offers a mechanism for the selective transmission of R5 HIV-1 in primary infection acquired through the upper gastrointestinal tract (Figure 2).\n",

Intestinal lymphocytes, on the other hand, express both CCR5 and CXCR4 and support replication by both R5 and X4 HIV-1 in vitro,43 indicating that intestinal lymphocytes also probably do not participate in the selective acquisition of R5 viruses during primary infection (Figure 2). Thus, epithelial cells, rather than resident macrophages or lymphocytes, appear to be the mucosal cell capable of selecting R5 HIV-1 in primary infection.",

            "text": "Taken together, the studies discussed above suggest the following sequence of events in the intestinal mucosa during early HIV-1 infection acquired by vertical transmission or homosexual contact. A mixture of R5 and X4 viruses, typically present in the blood of chronically infected donors, are released into the milk or semen and then enter the recipient through inoculation into the oral cavity. In the oral cavity, virus that reaches the tonsils encounters M cells in the overlying epithelium, and these cells deliver the virus to the dendritic cell\u2013rich lymphoid tissue of the tonsils. Although dendritic cells alone do not support HIV-1 replication, dendritic cell\u2013T cell conjugates support high levels of viral replication. Dendritic cells, which normally migrate through the lymphatics to secondary lymphoid organs, contain a C-type lectin that traps virus and thus may participate in the dissemination of HIV-1 from the gastrointestinal tract to lymphoid tissues.",

            "text": "In the oral cavity, virus mixes with saliva, which contains antiviral factors, including secretory leukocyte protease, a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 activity.66, 67 These factors may prevent local (tonsilar) infection, allowing swallowed virus to pass through the oral cavity. Passage through the stomach would be facilitated by the absence of gastric acid production in the fetus and neonate. In the adult, gastric acid could limit the amount of viable virus that reaches the intestine, but this issue requires further study. Thus, a mixture of inoculated viruses reaches the recipient's upper gastrointestinal tract mucosa. There, GalCer+CCR5+ CXCR4\u2212 epithelial cells bind and then selectively transfer R5 viruses from the cells' apical to basolateral surface, probably by microtubule-dependent, nondegradative transcytosis. Virus translocated across the epithelium encounters lamina propria macrophages and T cells, but only the lymphocytes express CCR5, the coreceptor that mediates R5 HIV-1 entry. Because the lamina propria contains the largest reservoir of activated T cells in the body and because HIV-1 replicates most efficiently in activated T cells, the lamina propria becomes the initial major site of HIV-1 replication and amplification. Virus that infects activated T cells in the organized lymphoid structures, possibly via M cell uptake and transport, could then disseminate HIV-1 to distant mucosal sites through normal receptor-mediated homing. Soon, HIV-1\u2013induced T cell death by cell lysis, apoptosis, and cytotoxic lymphocyte-induced killing, leads to rapid depletion of lamina propria CD4+ T cells long before the decrease in circulating CD4+ T cells.",

These peptides recruit to the mucosa CCR5+ and CXCR4+ monocytes and lymphocytes, which serve as new target cells for the perpetuation of local HIV-1 replication. As a consequence of this inflammation or possibly local HIV infection, mucosal function is compromised and malabsorption ensues, even before opportunistic infections induce clinical symptoms. Thus, besides serving as a site of opportunistic infections in late-stage HIV-1 disease, the gastrointestinal tract also plays a fundamental role in early HIV-1 disease by serving as the site for virus entry, the initial site of virus replication and amplification, and the initial site of CD4+ T cell depletion. As Veazey et al.62 aptly suggested, the gastrointestinal tract mucosa, not the peripheral lymphoid tissue, is the initial tissue site of HIV-1 disease.",

Thus, similar to successful control of tuberculosis, multiple antiretroviral agents were developed to suppress HIV-1 replication over long periods, decrease HIV-1 disease progression, and prevent or reverse HIV-1\u2013induced immunologic incompetence.103, 104, 105, 106, 107 This powerful \u201ccocktail\u201d of agents improves the natural history of HIV-1 infection by combining inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease to provide HAART.",

After attachment of HIV-1 to the cell membrane, release from its envelope, and entry into the cytoplasm, the retroviral RNA generates a double-stranded DNA provirus through reverse transcriptase. This proviral DNA can then enter the nucleus and integrate into the host cell genomic DNA, and viral replication is initiated, particularly in activated cells. However, during prolonged RTI therapy, site-specific mutations in the pol gene, which encodes reverse transcriptase, confer progressive resistance to RTI therapy, necessitating the use of additional agents to limit viral replication and the development of resistance. Protease inhibitors (PIs), a second major class of antiretroviral agents, induce dose-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 aspartic protease, which is required for production of mature infectious virions.99, 108 By blocking the cleavage of HIV-1 Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor into requisite structural core proteins and enzymes (reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease), PIs cause the production of abnormal viral proteins and noninfectious virions. However, the development of selective mutations in the protease during therapy leads to resistance, and resistance to one PI affects the susceptibility of HIV-1 to other PIs.99, 108 Thus, virtually all current HAART regimens include 3 or more agents (typically a PI and 2 NRTIs) to diminish or ablate viral replication (reflected in a reduction in viral load), prevent the development of resistance, enhance recovery of immunologic competence (resulting in an increase in CD4+ T cell number), and improve clinical status (based on CDC stage).99, 104, 108, 109, 110 Clinically, the goals of therapy are to prevent HIV-1\u2013associated illness and prolong survival.",

Similar results have been reported from Western Europe between 1994 and 1998 for AIDS-defining illnesses (Figure 3B) and for these and other infections in the United States.29, 78, 106, 111 These decreased rates were significant for a number of complications involving the alimentary tract, including esophageal candidiasis, MAC, CMV, cryptosporidiosis, and herpes simplex virus, as well as Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thus, combination antiretroviral therapy, particularly HAART, has had a significant impact on the natural history of HIV-1 infection and has substantially reduced the incidence of HIV-1\u2013related infectious and neoplastic diseases, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as death.",

Decreases in mortality and rates of infection before the introduction of PI and HAART were associated with earlier recognition of HIV-1 infection and treatment with ZDV, more rapid diagnosis and treatment of specific opportunistic infections, and prophylactic therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (and toxoplasmosis). The widespread introduction of ZDV and TMP-SMX, each of which has activity against gram-negative bacteria, also was associated with a dramatic decrease in HIV-1\u2013associated non-typhi Salmonellae infections in the United States.112, 113 Before this time, Salmonellae species were common causes of enteritis and bacteremia in these patients,114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119 as they remain in African patients with HIV-1 disease today. Other than the activity of the PI aprenavir against Giardia lamblia\n99 and of adefovir dipivoxil against DNA viruses (herpes simplex virus, CMV, and hepatitis B virus), most other antiretroviral agents have shown little activity against viral, bacterial, protozoan, or fungal pathogens.

First, effective control of HIV-1 results in a decreased incidence of secondary infections and decreased rates of reactivation of latent infections. Second, an indirect benefit of the decreased rates of such infections in patients receiving HAART is the discontinuation of long-time prophylactic antimicrobial therapy, leading to a decrease in the rate of antibiotic-associated enteric infections with Clostridium difficile,130, 131 as well as lower rates of drug reactions. A third consequence of HAART is the resolution of ongoing infections, probably because of repopulation of the peripheral T cells. Recent reports indicate that as the viral load decreases in the intestinal mucosa, CD4+ T cells repopulate the mucosa,132, 133 and that on HAART this repopulation occurs more rapidly in the intestinal mucosa than in the blood.134\n",

However, diarrhea recurred in 4 patients at a median of 11 months (range, 7\u201313 months) when the patients failed to respond to antiretroviral therapy (increase in plasma HIV-1 load and decrease in CD4+ T cell number).

Preliminary data suggest that the effects of IFN-\u03b1 therapy with ribavirin may be greater than with IFN-\u03b1 alone among both HIV-1\u2013infected and \u2013seronegative patients,153, 154 although anemia is an important complication. Another option for therapy in this group is HAART. Among HIV-1\u2013infected patients with hepatitis B, initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy may lead to resolution of chronic infection with the development of antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen. In several series that monitored HCV status in patients before and during HAART, levels of plasma HCV and transaminases showed transient and clinically inapparent increases in HCV (0%\u201390%) and transaminases (0%\u201333%).142, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159 However, HCV RNA decreased to below the limits of detection in a small minority, as is observed in up to 15% of otherwise healthy patients after initial infection. Although both severe and clinically inapparent hepatitis can occur in patients upon initiation of HAART,160, 161, 162, 163 the presence of coinfection with HCV and HIV-1 should not serve as a primary determinant of the decision to begin effective antiretroviral therapy. The relatively infrequent \u201cimmune restoration\u201d syndrome, in which deleterious inflammatory responses or even reactivation of infections (e.g., CMV and MAC) follow HAART,164, 165, 166 does not appear to affect HCV infections to any consistent degree. In patients with HIV-1 disease, efforts to limit the impact of HCV infection should include limiting alcohol use, administering hepatitis A vaccine if the patient is seronegative, monitoring hepatic transaminase levels, and considering specific therapy for HCV to eradicate infection or limit progressive liver injury in those with significant hepatic pathology.",

Consequently, they should be aware of the toxicities associated with antiretroviral and support drugs (Table 3).In general, gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, often occur early in the course of therapy and may abate over time. Gastrointestinal toxicity significantly limits the initial tolerance to protease inhibitors, often requiring dose escalation and sequential addition of other medications, such as nucleoside analogue RTI. Hepatic toxicity is more often associated with long-term therapy and is typically mild, although severe hepatic toxicity, particularly with the protease inhibitor ritonavir, may require discontinuation of the medication.162 Pancreatitis is a more specific complication of individual drugs. As in other immunocompromised hosts treated with multiple medications, such as organ and marrow transplant patients, rates of toxic reactions ascribed to each drug may be confounded by concomitant administration of 2 or more drugs. Increased rates of adverse events, such as pancreatitis or hepatic toxicity, also may result from simultaneous administration of medications with overlapping toxicities. Moreover, differentiating the symptoms of drug toxicities from those of opportunistic infections may require careful evaluation of the timing of events and presence of comorbid findings.",

Because many of the toxic effects of antiretroviral medications may be worse early in the course of treatment and are dose dependent, lowering the dose in this period may allow therapy to continue. However, optimal antiretroviral activity is usually dose dependent, particularly with PIs, and development of resistance of HIV-1 is a very real danger, so monitoring of both clinical and virologic status is important. Changing antiretroviral agents may be preferable to lowering doses. Evaluation of the overlapping toxicities of different medications and their effects on drug metabolism may allow successful continuation of the most critical agents. In this regard, patients should be asked about other unrecorded or nontraditional agents they may be taking. Severe or prolonged complications require discontinuation of individual agents, as does the development of hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common and may be quite difficult to resolve. Antidiarrheal agents, such as loperamide or diphenoxylate atropine, may be useful for drug-related diarrhea, as may antiemetics for vomiting. Taking medications with or after eating, when appropriate, may limit nausea.

The greatest challenge is to use newly gained insights into the pathogenesis of primary HIV-1 infection at mucosal sites to provide protection against the first exposure to the virus and against the subsequent irreversible decline in mucosal defense mechanisms.",
