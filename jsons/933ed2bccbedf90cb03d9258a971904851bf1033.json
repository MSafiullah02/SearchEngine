The virus spread rapidly with a fatality rate of about 40% [1, 2] . The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus belongs to the betacoronavirus genus which also hosts the pandemic 2003-2005 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that affected more than 30 countries [3] . These viruses have large, complex positive-sense RNA genomes that encode replicase, structural and accessory proteins. The replicase protein is cleaved by a viral protease to form the 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins [4] . The nonstructural proteins (nsps) are responsible for replication of the positive-sense RNA genome, transcription of subgenomic RNAs, and other RNA processing activities. Activities necessary for interference with host cell innate immune responses have been identified [5, 6] . The nonstructural protein 3 is a multifunctional protein consisting of several functional domains and approximately 2000 amino acid residues. This protein harbors one papain-like cysteine protease, transmembrane regions, RNA-binding proteins, and one or more macrodomains [7] [8] [9] . The macrodomains are of significant interest with respect to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) interaction. These domains comprise a multifunctional protein family that act on NAD + metabolites [10, 11] . They act as modulators of posttranslational modifications, including PARylation, mono(ADPribosylation), and related modifications. In addition to their known roles in PAR binding, some macrodomains function as enzymes, for example in O-acetyl ADP-ribose deacetylase and mono-ADPribose hydrolase reactions [12] . The catalytic domain of poly(ADPribose) glycosylase is also a macrodomain [13] . These domains have been termed readers, erasers and interpreters of PARylation and mARylation [10] .

Building on these results, a fold prediction algorithm may also be used to detect remote sequence similarities. FFAS (Fold and Function Assignment) incorporates this method [28] . FFAS performs protein sequence profile alignment to detect low levels of sequence similarity. All sequences used in and FFAS search must contain less than 1000 amino acids. Options are available for multiple sequences or for a pairwise sequence alignment. Several different databases may be searched, for example the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [48] , Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) [49] , Protein Families (Pfam) [50] , Classification Of proteins in complete Genomes (COG) [51] , and structural genomics sequence collections as well as complete genomes of individual organisms. Search results include a score that is derived from the FFAS algorithm. The algorithm arranges the matching profile alignments, with those that have the highest confidence on top. An FFAS score of \u22129.5 or lower is the criterion for a protein to match a known fold [52] . Jpred [29] provides secondary structure predictions about the protein sequence. Initially, Jpred uses PSI-BLAST to create multiple alignments, and the JNet neural network algorithm [53] is then used to make secondary structure predictions based on the multiple sequence alignment combined with predicted solvent accessibility. A one-letter sequence is used or a file with multiple sequences can be uploaded (plain text, FASTA, MSF, BLC, or Batch). The size limit per sequence is 800 residues in plain text format. The results include the secondary structure prediction confidence for each residue. Secondary structure components are marked with the letter H for \u03b1-helix regions, E for \u03b2 strands and the letter B for buried residues. Each residue will also have a reliability score from 0 to 9, in which residues with a high score are predicted with higher confidence than those with lower scores [54] .

First, based on sequence alignments and conserved protein sequence motifs, putative macrodomains may be identified. Macrodomains share a globular structure of \u03b2-sheets flanked by \u03b1-helices. While several human, bacterial, and viral macrodomains have been found to share a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 architecture, many proteins in the macrodomain family contain additional \u03b1-helices and/or \u03b2-sheets in their folds [58] . The arrangement of these predicted secondary structures assists in identifying this protein family. Slight variations, such as the addition of a single \u03b1-helix at the beginning or end of the protein may occur [54, 59] . For example, in the SARS-CoV, the SUD-N domain has a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 fold whereas the SUD-M domain has a \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 fold [54] . In addition, conserved protein sequence motifs are associated with the macrodomain family. For example, the macrodomain ADP-ribose hydrolases employ the backbones of certain residues such as \"GGGV\" and \"GIYG\" to coordinate with the phosphate groups of ADP-ribose [60] . The MacroD1-like proteins employ a conserved aspartate and histidine as part of a catalytic triad to deprotonate a water molecule which can act as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl carbon of an ADPribosylated protein [61, 62] .

Residues predicted to be involved in ADP-ribose recognition via output of the BioLiP database and COACH program are shown with green and black stars, respectively. Red stars indicate residues predicted to be involved in ADP-ribose recognition by both BioLiP and COACH. Black diamonds indicate residues that are conserved with respect to residues involved in interactions with the ligand, in the SARS-CoV macrodomain complex identified by Glide docking (Fig. 2a) involved in the binding of ADP-ribose: the \"NAAN\" motif stabilizes the distal ribose through the sidechains of the second asparagine, the \"SAGIF\" stabilizes the two phosphate groups, and in the \"DAIQ\" motif, the carbonyl group of the aspartate forms hydrogen bonds with the adenine moiety of ADP-ribose in the binding pocket [23, 59, 63] . PAR glycosylases also contain a conserved \"GGG\" motif used to coordinate ADP-ribose but employ a \"QEE\" sequence where the two glutamate residues and a conserved N-terminal aspartate are responsible for trapping a water molecule for a nucleophilic attack on an ADP-ribose substrate for PAR cleavage [64, 65] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 152, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 153, "end": 157, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 158, "end": 162, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 563, "end": 567, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 779, "end": 783, "text": "[54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 784, "end": 787, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 907, "end": 911, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1181, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1408, "text": "[61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1412, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1908, "end": 1911, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3017, "end": 3021, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3022, "end": 3025, "text": "59,", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 3026, "end": 3029, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 3330, "end": 3334, "text": "[64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 3335, "end": 3338, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1447, "end": 1457, "text": "Fig. 1 (a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2682, "end": 2691, "text": "(Fig. 2a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Minimal Media Expression"}, {"text": "Putative macrodomains that lack conserved motifs may be identified by a fold prediction algorithm such as FFAS.

Obtain a Kimble NMR tube and use extended tip pipette to wash with ultra-pure water. Rinse the tube three times with buffer before placing the sample in the tube. Ensure no bubbles are present in the NMR tube. The STD-NMR experiment is a commonly used ligand screening technique for rapid analysis of protein-ligand interactions. This method is based on the transfer of magnetization from protein to ligand [96] . This process occurs by the application of a low-power radiofrequency pulse to the protein [96] . This saturation builds up through the entire protein through intramolecular 1 H-1 H nuclear Overhauser effect transfer. This saturation will also transfer to other protons located close to the protein in a binding pocket [101] . Thus, ligands that bind to a selectively irradiated protein will also become saturated. Experimentally, this process is useful because the saturated protons from a bound ligand dissociate, where they relax more slowly than in the bound state [101] . The saturation may be observed in a difference spectrum. The spectrum with on-resonance saturation is subtracted from the spectrum with off-resonance saturation [102] . The difference spectrum contains only signals from the ligand involved in the binding event. Consequently, this method has become widely used to identify compounds that bind to proteins of interest, and to carry out epitope mapping of binding compounds. Notably, there are a few drawbacks. If a ligand binds too weakly then it will not stay bound long enough to be saturated sufficiently, and conversely, if it binds too tightly then the saturated ligand will relax too quickly to be detected [96] . For a good STD-NMR experiment, the ligand should have dissociation constants, K D , ranging from approximately 10 \u22123 to 10 \u22128 M.

The spectra can be deconvoluted to determine the global secondary structure content of a protein, using various methods and software (recently reviewed by N.J. Greenfield [106] ). The assumption used by all methods is that the observed spectrum is a linear combination of the spectra of its secondary structural components plus a noise contribution from aromatic groups and prosthetic groups. For example, a CD measurement that has strong minima at 222 nm and 208 nm is expected to have a large fraction of \u03b1-helix structure.

Setting up the Glide docking program involves selecting the grid file generated in step 2 and the ligand file or library prepared in step 1. The user then decides which docking mode to use and sets up the score penalties for conformational changes and torsions in docking the higher energy states of the ligand. The other important options to select are the extent of receptor flexibility during the docking and output formats for the resulting poses and scores. 4. Results analysis.
