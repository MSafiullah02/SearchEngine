It remains unknown, however, how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) evades respiratory innate immunity to establish a systemic infection. Here we show in Chinese macaques that SARS-CoV traversed the mucosa through the respiratory tract within 2 days, resulting in extensive mucosal infiltration by Tcells, MAC387 \u00fe , and CD163 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages followed by limited viral replication in the lung but persistent viral shedding into the upper airway. Mucosal monocytes/macrophages sequestered virions in intracellular vesicles together with infected Langerhans cells and migrated into the tonsils and/or draining lymph nodes within 2 days. In lymphoid tissues, viral RNA and proteins were detected in infected monocytes upon differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) within 3 days. Systemic viral dissemination was observed within 7 days. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the spatiotemporal interactions of SARS-CoV, monocytes/macrophages, and the DC network in mucosal tissues and highlights the fact that, while these innate cells contribute to viral clearance, they probably also serve as shelters and vehicles to provide a mechanism for the virus to escape host mucosal innate immunity and disseminate systemically.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and life-threatening human respiratory disease caused by a zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 1 The global transmission of SARS-CoV is dependent on the capacity of this virus to efficiently cross from one host to the next by traversing the respiratory mucosa and overcoming host defenses to establish an infection, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. It is surprising that our knowledge of the immune events in the upper respiratory mucosa, in particular during acute respiratory infection, remains rather limited. Although the SARS epidemic was successfully contained by July 2003, there is serious concern regarding a recurrence of severe CoV-mediated disease. In particular, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus has recently been identified as the etiological agent of a severe respiratory illness in patients from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and the United Kingdom. 2, 3 Unraveling how upper airway mucosal exposure of SARS-CoV results in the establishment of infection and subsequent systemic virus dissemination is critical to understand its pathogenesis and to identify key steps for the future prevention of related disease.",

            "text": "The respiratory mucosa constitutes not only a natural barrier to pathogen invasion but also serves as an important gateway for respiratory infection. Many viruses, including SARS-CoV, breach this mucosal barrier by infecting the epithelium directly. 4, 5 After an initial amplification at the entry site, viruses interact with various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and T cells, beneath the epithelium. 6 Previous studies showed that these immune cells differ in their ability to induce an innate immune response against virus and in their roles in either the elimination or dissemination of viral infection. The roles they have greatly depend on their activation or differentiation status, as well as their susceptibility to virus infection and replication. [7] [8] [9] For example, during early lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, the virus targets monocytes/macrophages and DCs, contributing to immunosuppression that leads to persistent infection. 7, 8 During vaccinia virus infection, however, despite the fact that vaccinia virus also infects inflammatory monocytes, CD8 \u00fe T cells pursue and lyse infected inflammatory monocytes and eliminate the infection at the primary site. 10 In the case of HIV-1 infection, it is the activated mucosal CD38 \u00fe CD4 \u00fe T cells that are crucial for infection and dissemination of HIV-1 through the mucosa of the female lower genital tract. 11 Type I alveolar epithelium is the predominant target for SARS-CoV infection, and macrophages were found to be subsequently infected in patients who died of SARS. 4 Infection leads to intense innate immune responses, which contribute to lung pathology. Patients also have evidence of systemic infection as indicated by other organ and immune dysfunctions, including prominent gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea, splenic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy. [12] [13] [14] Among these, acute renal failure in SARS patients usually has a catastrophic outcome, with a mortality rate of 77%. 15 Consistently, previous reports have described SARS viral particles and genomic sequences in urine, the mucosa of the intestine, the epithelium of the renal distal tubules, the neurons of the brain, circulating lymphocytes, and lymphoid tissues. 4, 16, 17 Although much is known about the terminal phase of SARS, little is known about the early events during the acute phase of infection. The early cellular target(s) of infection remain elusive, as do the innate immune response during acute infection, particularly in the upper respiratory tract, which is the initial site for SARS-CoV infection and replication, and the roles of innate cells in disease progression. Understanding of these factors requires robust knowledge of the phenotypes and functional features of the cells in the respiratory mucosa that are implicated in the early events of SARS-CoV infection, which is difficult to study in SARS-CoV-infected humans owing to difficulties in collecting samples during the acute phase of infection.",

An additional three mock-inoculated animals served as negative controls (Figure 1a) . Although there were no remarkable changes in leukocyte counts and clinical signs such as cough, upper respiratory tract catarrh, dyspnea, loss of appetite, vomiting, rash, and diarrhea were absent, all infected animals did develop fever (B40 1C). SARS-CoV RNA was readily detected by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) in oral swabs from all infected macaques at multiple time points tested (Figure 1b) , peaking at 1 or 2 dpi, with a slight decrease over the following days. By day 7, viral loads were maintained at similar levels in three out of four macaques, AD0516, AD0517, and AD0518, but were undetectable in one macaque (AD0515) (Figure 1b) . In contrast, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in lung homogenates from two out of four macaques at 2 dpi (AD0506 and AD0508) and one of four macaques at 3 and 7 dpi only (AD0513 and AD0516), suggesting a trend towards decreased viral replication over time in the lungs. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung tissues collected at the time of necropsy (2-7 dpi) revealed mild damage as indicated by thickened alveolar septa without the typical diffuse alveolar damage found among SARS patients at the time of necropsy (2-7 dpi) ( Figure 1c) .",

Further extensive IHC analysis revealed NP \u00fe epithelial cells along the entire respiratory tract within 2 dpi in infected animals but not in control animals. In agreement with viral RNA detection by RT-PCR (Figure 1b) , NP signals were predominant in the pharynx mucosa and the lungs by day 2 ( Table 2 and Figure 2 ). Subsequently, more NP signals were detected at 7 dpi in the epithelium lining the nasal cavity and the vascular endothelium beneath the pharyngeal mucosa ( Figure 2a,e) , suggesting a time lag for viral dissemination. In the lungs, NP \u00fe alveolar pneumocytes were primarily found at 2 dpi (2/4 monkeys, AD0506 and AD0508) and infrequently at 3 and 7 dpi (1/8 monkeys, AD0518) ( Table 1) . Further analysis via detection of epithelial membrane antigen (AE1/AE3), viral N protein, and viral genome RNA, however, demonstrated concentrated signals for both NP and viral RNA in AE1/AE3 \u00fe cells in the lungs at 2 dpi (2/4 monkeys, AD0506 and AD0508) and 7 dpi (AD0518), but only NP signals were detected in the upper respiratory mucosa, indicating a higher efficiency of viral replication in alveolar pneumocytes than in the upper respiratory mucosal epithelium during acute infection ( Figure 3 and Table 1) . Collectively, these findings demonstrated that a broad range of mucosal epithelial cells could be targeted for SARS-CoV seeding in the respiratory mucosal tissues, which is in line with the distribution of ACE2 \u00fe cells as we previously described. 20 Moreover, the results suggest a trend toward rapid control of epithelial infection in the lungs and more persistent viral production in the upper airway mucosa.",

Moreover, infected epithelium also induces the migration of circulating blood monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes to the inflamed site of infection, rendering it a key place for immune responses to occur. 6 Beneath respiratory epithelial cells, NP \u00fe immune cells were readily detected within the lamina propria of the pharyngeal mucosa of all infected animals (Figure 2b -e). To understand the innate immune response and define the phenotypes of these NP \u00fe cells, IHC double staining with a SARS NP antibody and antibodies for lymphocytes (CD3, CD20), macrophages (MAC387, CD68, CD163), or DCs (DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), Langerin) was performed. In infected animals but not in control animals, the pharyngeal mucosa exhibited strong staining of monocytes/ macrophages, indicating monocyte/macrophage infiltra tion as early as 2 dpi (Figure 4 and see Supplementary Figure S1 online). These monocytes/macrophages include recently infiltrated monocytes/macrophages (MAC387 \u00fe ), as well as activated/inflammatory macrophages (CD163 \u00fe ) (see Supplementary Figure S1 ). In contrast, CD68 \u00fe Figure 1 Intranasal inoculation of Chinese rhesus macaques with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). (a) Experimental scheme for virus challenge. A total of 12 Chinese rhesus macaques were challenged with live pathogenic SARS-CoV (10 5 TCID 50 ) via the nasal cavity. Four animals each were killed at 2, 3, and 7 days postinoculation (dpi). Three additional uninfected macaques were challenged with phosphate-buffered saline as negative controls. (b) Detection of viral RNA in oral swabs and lungs. SARS-CoV RNA was detected by nested reverse transcriptase-PCR in the swabs at multiple time points postinfection from all 12 monkeys and in lung homogenates from two out of four macaques at 2 dpi (AD0506 and AD0508) and one out of four macaques at 3 and 7 dpi (AD0513 and AD0516). (c) Examples of hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung tissue. Macaques inoculated with SARS-CoV exhibited slightly thickened alveolar septa and some monocyte infiltration at days 2, 3, and 7 (red arrows) with epithelial cell debris present in the alveolar lumen at day 2 (2 days, blue arrows). Macaques inoculated with cell culture medium exhibited normal alveolar septa, intact reticular fibers, and epithelial lining (Neg). Each image is representative of at least three monkeys. monocytes/macrophages and Langerin \u00fe cells (LCs) were identified in the lamina propria in both infected and control animals (see Supplementary Figure S1 ). Interestingly, whereas the majority of CD163 \u00fe and nearly all CD68 \u00fe macrophages were localized beneath the epithelium in the lamina propria or mucosa-associated lymph tissue (MALT) (Figure 4a ,b and see Supplementary Figure S1 ), many MAC387 \u00fe and some CD163 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages were found within and surrounding the epithelial layers targeted by SARS-CoV (Figure 4b and see Supplementary Figure S1 ), suggesting a possible role for these cells in the control of epithelial infection.",

The positive staining for NP in CD163 \u00fe and CD68 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages and LCs suggests that the virus infected these cells within the pharyngeal mucosa. Indeed, double staining with antibodies for the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and cell markers showed that, in addition to alveolar pneumocytes, bronchial epithelium, and vascular endothelial cells, many immune cells demonstrated even stronger positive signals for ACE2 in the lungs (see Supplementary Figure S2A ). These cells include CD68 \u00fe and MAC387 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages, Langerin \u00fe DCs, and some CD163 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages (see Supplementary Figure S2 and Table 2 ).

Importantly, the number of CD163 \u00fe cells was about three times higher than that of MAC387 \u00fe population, and these cells were densely gathered around infected alveolar pneumocytes to form cell clusters ( Figure 5 and see Supplementary Figure S3 ). CD163 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages within the cell clusters were enlarged in size, suggesting a histological manifestation of activation. Double IHC staining for cell markers and NP or ISH detection of SARS-CoV RNA revealed concentrated signals for both viral NP and RNA in a single intracellular compartment in CD163 \u00fe and CD68 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages in the lungs (Figure 5a b,d,e). Furthermore, IHC staining of viral NP, CD81 (cell membrane marker), and CD63 (late endosome marker) in monocytes/macrophages revealed that NP signals were detected within intracellular compartments that were CD81 \u00fe /CD63 \u00c0 (see Supplementary Figure S4 ). Because apoptotic bodies are CD63-enriched compartments, 21 these NP \u00fe compartments in monocytes/macrophages were unlikely apoptotic bodies but probably accumulated virions in intracellular vesicles designated as virus-containing compartments (VCCs).

In both human and macaques, lymphatic drainage to the cervical LN occurs from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and Waldeyer's ring. Trachea and lung lymphatics drain to the tracheobronchial and hilar LNs, respectively. To monitor the periphery for viral spread, we also studied spleen samples. By IHC, we found NP \u00fe cells in lymphatic tissues of all experimentally infected macaques but not control animals ( Figure 7 ). As early as 2 dpi, all dLNs tested contained NP antigen in agreement with a broad range of viral seeding into the entire respiratory mucosal tissues. The appearance of NP antigen in the spleen, however, was less frequent at 2 and 3 dpi, observed only among two and three out of four animals, respectively. At 7 dpi, however, all of the animals were positive for NP antigen in the spleen ( Figure 7 and Table 1 ). These results demonstrated that, within 2 days of an intranasal inoculation, infected cells quickly disseminate virus to dLNs. Once there, systemic dissemination occurs shortly thereafter. Further study on intestinal samples showed positive signals for NP in the small intestines of all infected animals at 7 dpi ( Figure 7g and Table 1) , providing additional evidence of viral systemic dissemination within 7 days. We then performed ISH for SARS-CoV RNA to further confirm viral production and determine the frequency and location of productively infected cells in the dLNs. Strong signal for viral genome RNA was detected in the tracheobronchial and hilar LNs (Figure 7e,f) . Infected cells were localized to the trabecular and germinal center, as well as the T-cell-dependent, paracortical zone of the dLN (Figure 7f) . These findings suggested that infected cells migrate to the dLN via the afferent lymphatics and enter the node through the subcapsular sinus. From here, these cells traverse to the T-cell-dependent areas in the paracortical regions of the nodes. We subsequently defined the cell types that carry infectious virus and support productive infection in the hilar lymphoid nodes. dLN sections were studied for RNA production by ISH, together with antibodies for DCs (DC-SIGN and Langerin), monocytes/macrophages (CD68, CD163 and MAC387), T cells (CD3), and B cells (CD20). Consistent with the findings in the tonsils, the increased number of CD68 \u00fe and CD163 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages was readily observed in the dLNs (see Supplementary Figure S5 ). Compared with the tonsils, only small numbers of LCs were detected in the LNs. Moreover, low-level RNA signals were also found in CD68 \u00fe cells around the trabecular septum (Figure 8b1 , blue arrow) but not in cells expressing MAC387 or Langerin (Figure 8c,d) . The strongest RNA signals, however, were observed in DC-SIGN \u00fe cells in the T-cell-dependent paracortical zone of the hilar LNs (Figure 8a,b2,c) . (Figure 8a1 ,b2,c, red arrow). DC-SIGN is a MDDC-specific lectin. 25 These infected cells likely represent different stages of the differentiation of the monocyte subpopulation (CD68 \u00fe and CD163 \u00fe ) into DCs, during which monocytes begin to express DC-SIGN and downregulate monocyte marker expression. 26, 27 The increased levels of viral RNA following monocyte differentiation into DCs indicate that viral replication efficiency depends on the differentiation status of the cells. Nevertheless, in comparison with the restricted NP signals in intracellular compartments in CD68 \u00fe and CD163 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages in the upper airway mucosa, strong NP signals were evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of those cells in the tonsils (Figure 6c,d) , suggesting that enhanced virus replication was also present in these cells after migration into tonsils. These results suggested that CD163 \u00fe and CD68 \u00fe cells at the primary respiratory mucosa site of infection probably serve as viral reservoirs and allow SARS-CoV to evade local innate immunity by sequestering virus in an internal niche, which is difficult to access from the exterior. Virus replication capacity is subsequently enhanced following the differentiation of monocytes into DCs as they migrate to lymphoid tissue, resulting in productive infection in tonsils and dLNs and eventually systemic dissemination. Notably, in agreement with a previous description that infected macrophages present internally sequestered HIV to uninfected target cells at a virological synapse, 28 we also observed the formation of infectious synapses between CD163 \u00fe cells and NP \u00fe cells (see Supplementary Figure S6 , blue arrow). Therefore, we conclude that CD163 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages may have a critical role in the dissemination of infection by sheltering and transferring live virus to the dLNs from the respiratory mucosa and further support virus production upon differentiation into MDDCs.",

Upon penetration of this barrier, viruses interact with mucosal monocyte/macrophages, lymphocytes, and LCs, which form the second line of innate host defense and bridge the third line of adaptive immunity. 6, 10 Although this interaction is necessary for triggering immune protection, the virus may highjack immune cells to facilitate its dissemination and infection. For example, in the case of HIV sexual transmission, mucosal LCs and DCs have a role in capturing and disseminating newly produced virus to the main target, CD4 \u00fe T cells, which are essential for the establishment of productive infection. 11, 29 To date, the early respiratory mucosal events of SARS-CoV infection remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated these events in Chinese macaques following the intranasal inoculation of a pathogenic live SARS-CoV. This model has been reported to mirror the pathogenesis of human SARS in several studies. 19, 30, 31 The clinical relevance of this model includes elevated body temperature, lung pathology, SARS-CoV antigen detection in type I pneumocytes, and eventually viral systemic dissemination in infected macaques, providing strong support for the extrapolation of the findings in our study to the transmission and dissemination of respiratory infection in humans. 19, 30, 31 We first examined the process of SARS-CoV infection from the site of entry to the respiratory portion of the lung and subsequent systemic dissemination, as well as the status and role of respiratory mucosa innate immunity in protection, productive infection, and transmission of the virus. By measuring the cells that were positive for viral NP protein, we found that SARS-CoV spread quickly from the upper respiratory tract to the lung within 2 dpi (Figure 2) , which includes epithelial cells from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, laryngopharynx, trachea, and bronchus (Figure 2a-g) . The majority of positive cells were abundantly identified in the pharynx areas, including the epithelial cells lining the salivary ducts, that we previously described (Figure 2) . 20 These areas are likely one of the major sites of SARS-CoV invasion and shedding. Under the epithelial cells, we found that monocytes/ macrophages and DCs were actively involved in SARS-CoV infection. As shown in Figures 4 and 5 , resident CD68 \u00fe macrophages and inflammatory CD163 \u00fe macrophages were among the early target cells infected within 2 dpi. The infection of epithelial cells resulted in the significant recruitment of circulating blood monocytes, macrophages, and eventually lymphocytes to the sites of viral invasion. In particular, the rapid recruitment of MAC387 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages and selective accumulation of CD163 \u00fe macrophages indicated active chemotaxis owing to local inflammation. 7 However, the monocyte/macrophage population was not homogeneous in its ability to be infected and to support viral replication and transmission (Figures 4 and 5) . Despite the universal expression of ACE2 on MAC387 macrophages (see Supplementary Figure S2B ), SARS-CoV mainly infected CD163 \u00fe or CD68 \u00fe macrophages in the respiratory mucosa (Figures 4 and 5) .",

Several previous studies showed that in vitro infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages/DCs was likely abortive. 32, 33 As these studies used monocyte-derived primary . This section is a representative sample of productively infected cells that are DC-SIGN \u00fe and CD163 \u00c0 (a1, \u00c2 400, red arrow), CD163 hi and DC-SIGN low (a2, \u00c2 400, white arrow) or CD163 hi and DC-SIGN hi (a2, blue arrow). (b) Viral RNA, CD68, and DC-SIGN ( \u00c2 400). This section shows that infected cells are DC-SIGN \u00fe and CD68 \u00fe (b1, blue arrow) and DC-SIGN \u00fe and CD68 \u00c0 (b2, red arrow). (c) Viral RNA, MAC387, and DC-SIGN ( \u00c2 400). Infected cells are DC-SIGN \u00fe and MAC387 \u00c0 (red arrow). (d) Viral RNA, Langerin, and DC-SIGN ( \u00c2 400). Infected cells are DC-SIGN \u00fe and Langerin \u00c0 (red arrow). (e) Model of mucosal transmission of SARS-CoV. Langerhans cells are shown in green, macrophages in blue, and virus in red. SARS-CoV infects the epithelium and resident macrophages shortly after infection. Immune cells are subsequently recruited in droves via a chemotactic gradient from the infected epithelium and/or tissue-resident and alveolar macrophages. Those inflammatory cells are heterogeneously composed of CD163 \u00fe macrophages and recently infiltrated MAC387 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages. CD163 \u00fe macrophages are productively infected when fighting against the infection and subsequently transmit virus to the draining lymph nodes by migrating via the afferent lymphatics. In the nasopharynx and oropharynx, Langerhans cells were also infected and migrated to the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. However, active viral replication was not detected in the Langerhans cells. Their role in virus production and transmission remains uncertain. macrophages/DCs, mainly terminally differentiated cells, they might not reflect the in vivo situation, especially when monocytes/macrophages are highly plastic and heterogeneous in vivo. We detected compartmented viral RNA in VCCs of monocytes/macrophages in respiratory mucosa but abundant viral RNA in the cytoplasm of MDDCs in the dLNs (Figure 8) . We speculated that, although infected monocytes/macrophages might not produce viruses effectively in mucosa, they might have supported a low level of viral replication after they differentiated into DCs in the dLNs. This is possible because cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor) produced by infected cells could skew cell differentiation from macrophages to DCs. 34, 35 To this end, low levels of SARS-CoV replication were found in MDDCs in one study. 36 Critically, infectious SARS-CoV was released into culture supernatants and recovered from infected MDDCs. 36 Recent studies also demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection of monocytes/macrophages could induce DC-SIGN expression on these cells. 37 CD163 protein levels are suppressed when monocytes differentiate toward DCs. 27 To determine the activation/differentiation status of infected monocytes/macrophages, we measured the expression of DC-SIGN and CD163 on viral RNA \u00fe cells in dLNs ( Figure 8) . Interestingly, we likely identified virus-infected monocytes at different stages of differentiation into DCs in the dLNs, as indicated by strong RNA signals in MDDCs (DC-SIGN \u00fe ), which still express low levels of CD163 ( Figure 8 ). The lack of active viral replication in mucosal monocytes/macrophages and the restriction of virions in the CD81 \u00fe /CD63 \u00c0 intracellular compartment (see Supplementary Figure S4 ) are probably beneficial for viruses to escape local antiviral innate immunity, because low levels of viral RNA in the cytoplasm and protein on the cell surface help the virus to avoid Toll-like receptor sensing and killing by natural killer cells. This hypothesis is based on similar intracellular structures recently described in HIV-infected macrophages, which concentrate virions in CD81 \u00fe , plasma membrane-derived intracellular invaginations during infection. 22, 24 Importantly, the sequestered HIV was able to translocate to the virological synapse formed between infected macrophages and uninfected T cells. 28 Consistently, we also observed virological synapses formed between CD163 \u00fe monocytes and NP \u00fe cells (see Supplementary Figure S6 ), suggesting possible cell-to-cell transmission. Moreover, the increased virus production efficiency in monocytes upon differentiation into DCs might have resulted in the establishment of productive infection in lymphoid tissue, virus release into the circulating system, and eventual systemic dissemination.",

LCs specifically express Langerin and were previously reported to mediate the transmission of HIV-1 to T cells and to keep LCs refractory to HIV-1 transmission in different studies. 11, 29 To determine the role of LCs in SARS-CoV transmission, we double stained pharyngeal mucosal tissue sections with antibodies against SARS NP and DC-SIGN or Langerin. We revealed the distribution, migration, and potential role of LCs in the upper respiratory system during SARS-CoV infection, as schematically summarized in Figure 8 . We readily found a large number of LCs in the intraepithelial and subepithelial areas of the pharynx (Figure 4c and see Supplementary Figure S1A ). Similar to monocytes/macrophages, upon encountering a virus, NP \u00fe LCs were found in the epithelial lining of the pharyngeal mucosa ( Figure 4c ) and migrated rapidly from the pharynx mucosa into the tonsils (Figure 6b) . The large number of NP \u00fe LCs in the tonsil suggested a highly effective process by LCs for antigen presentation and virus dissemination into lymphoid tissues (Figure 6b) . The lack of viral RNA signal in LCs by ISH, however, indicated that LCs probably do not support productive viral replication. We, however, cannot exclude the possibility that NP \u00fe LCs are able to transmit virus to other cells and produce small amounts of virus. To this end, we detected many cells harboring viral RNA in the tonsils by ISH, which confirmed virus infection of the upper respiratory mucosa (Figures 6 and 7) . This finding indicated that tonsils can be another source of virus in oral swabs, particularly early in infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of productive SARS-CoV infection in the tonsils. SARS-CoV production preferentially persists in the upper respiratory mucosa during the acute phase, as indicated by the prevalent virus antigen in the mucosal epithelium and immune cells beneath the epithelium (Figure 2) , and more importantly, the persistent viral loads in the oral swabs ( Figure 1) .",

Among four macaques killed at 2 dpi, however, only two (AD0506 and AD0508) exhibited extensive positive signals (Figure 2) , and only scattered NP \u00fe cells were found in the lungs of two other macaques. These results, together with the NP \u00fe cells found in the LNs draining the lungs, suggested that SARS-CoV was disseminated to the lower respiratory system in a rather effective and rapid manner. Moreover, viral RNA was readily detected in type I pneumocytes, which was indicative of productive infection established in the lungs. T cells were productively infected in the LNs of patients who died of SARS. 16 We, however, could not detect infected T cells in the respiratory mucosa or LNs during the acute phase (2 dpi) (data not shown). T cells, therefore, are unlikely to be early targets of infection in Chinese macaque model. Whether these findings underlie the lack of SARS in Chinese macaques remains to be investigated in future. 18 In summary, our findings led to a model of SARS-CoV mucosal infection (Figure 8) . The virus breaches the mucosal barrier by infecting the respiratory epithelium, mainly around the pharynx and larynx, and subsequently infects mucosal Langerhans cells and resident macrophages. In the meantime, CD163 \u00fe and MAC387 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages are quickly recruited in droves by a chemotactic gradient from infected epithelium and tissue-resident macrophages. However, these monocytes/macrophages are unlikely to be sufficient to eliminate the incoming viral attack, which allows LGs and CD163 \u00fe /CD68 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages carrying the virus to migrate to the MALT and dLNs via the afferent lymphatics. Once inside, CD163 \u00fe monocytes/macrophages unexpectedly support productive viral replication upon differentiation into DCs. Free virus and infected DCs may infect or trans-infect new target cells, respectively, and then leave through the efferent lymphatics for systemic dissemination (e.g., spleen and intestine, Figure 7d ,g).",
