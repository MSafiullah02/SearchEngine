These include a diverse group of viruses causing diseases ranging from asymptomatic infection to fatal syndromes and imported cases have significant public health implications. VHFs can be transmitted to humans by vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks or by contact with blood or other animal secretions. The majority also have potential for transmission from human to human.",

The majority had at risk occupations such as butchers or leather processing, or had been involved in high-risk activities such as animal slaughter. In Oman 39% (13/33) of the total number of cases reported have been in non-Omani nationals of which Bangledeshi residents (n = 8/13) were the largest group [43].",

As previously discussed the total numbers identified also represent a significant underestimate due to incomplete reporting of cases from endemic regions and the likelihood of undiagnosed mild CCHF cases. Clinically CCHF can be difficult to distinguish from other causes of undifferentiated febrile illness and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. This is mainly due to its non-specific clinical presentation and a lack of diagnostic laboratory capability in endemic regions. In combination with a lack of awareness of CCHF by clinicians many patients with mild disease may remain undiagnosed. The incubation period is variable (1\u201313 days) and initial signs and symptoms including fever and myalgia are easily misdiagnosed as influenza like illness. Haemorrhagic complications start around the fourth day of symptoms and it is at this stage that CCHF is often first considered. Malaria also shares epidemiological and clinical overlap and must be considered in any febrile traveller, particularly with thrombocytopenia, and co-infection with CCHF has been reported [45], [46].",

During the West Africa outbreak many countries implemented travel restrictions [55], [56], and public health screening measures at airports. National and international recommendations for enhanced training and improved personal protection equipment have also been updated in light of recent experience [57]. The key to early diagnosis and prevention of nosocomial transmission is a detailed travel history that is often omitted in emergency room settings [58].

            "text": "The number of reported cases of CCHF in travellers is low, but international travel to CCHF endemic areas is increasing and the geographical range of CCHF is also enlarging, including within Europe. Clinicians and laboratory personnel managing returning travellers should maintain a high index of suspicion. A travel history should be taken from all patients with fever with or without bleeding, and a more detailed history of possible occupational, recreational or domestic exposure to animals and ticks should be obtained from those visiting at risk countries. Fever and thrombocytopenia is more often caused by malaria, dengue and other infections but can also be a clue to the diagnosis of CCHF. Undiagnosed cases present the highest risk of nosocomial transmission including to healthcare personnel and this can be prevented by early recognition and patient isolation. Travellers to endemic areas should be warned about the risks of tick bites and about safe removal of ticks (Box 1\n). The public health challenge for travel health professionals is how to raise awareness of the special risks among travellers attending family or religious events that include slaughtering of animals.Box 1\nRecommendations for Travellers\u2022Travellers should be made aware of the risk activities for CCHF and be given advice on appropriate protective measures when in rural endemic areas.\u2022Light coloured clothing should be worn to increase the visibility of ticks including long trousers tucked into socks. Clothing can be treated with permethrin and a DEET solution applied to bare skin.\u2022Travellers should check themselves regularly for attached ticks and if noticed these should not be removed with unprotected hands.\u2022Travellers should avoid direct contact with animals and if involved in animal slaughtering practices, should wear appropriate personal protective equipment.\u2022After travel to a CCHF endemic area travellers with a fever should immediately attend healthcare facilities and report possible CCHF exposure\nRecommendations for Healthcare Personnel\u2022A risk assessment for CCHF should be undertaken if there is history of fever and travel to an endemic country (e.g. detailed travel history, history of tick bites, animal contact, participation in animal slaughter)\u2022Clinical presentation of CCHF is non-specific initially and laboratory abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and raised liver enzymes (ALT/AST)/creatinine kinase may give a clue to the diagnosis.\u2022The main risk of nosocomial transmission to HCWs is through needle stick injuries or splashes of blood/body fluids to mucous membranes\u2022A suspect or confirmed CCHF case must be isolated and standard, contact and droplet precautions should be undertaken. Healthcare personnel must wear personal protective equipment including a medical mask, facial shield/goggles, gloves and a fluid repellant gown. An N95/FFP3 mask should be worn during aerosol generating procedures, e.g. endotracheal intubation\u2022Healthcare personnel should not touch ticks directly with bare hands. Ticks should be removed by tweezers using gloves.\u2022Laboratory workers should process samples in appropriate biosafety level laboratories. Laboratories should be fully informed before sending a clinical sample from a patient suspected of having CCHF.\n",
