It has been emphasized that diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 was an especially important tool in the diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19. 2 We included 3232 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized between January 18 th and March 27 th , 2020 (data cutoff date) at Tongji Hospital, a designated hospital for severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. All patients included in the present study were verified as positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The specific operation methods were 3 followed according to the instructions and were consistent with other literature. 3, 4 According to the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan issued by the National Health Commission, all patients included were diagnosed as moderate to severe cases. Clinical data were collected from medical records. The Ethical Committee of Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College at Huazhong University of Science and Technology approved this study (TJ-IRB20200311). Written informed consent was not obtained because the data were analyzed retrospectively and anonymously.",

The overall positive rate of NP was 18.1% (207/1141), which was higher than that of OP (16.7%, 1718/10 314). The positive rates also differed between patients who were died and discharged (37.0% vs. 16.0%). It should be noted that only 42.5% of death cases (62/146) were tested positive in the last RT-PCR test before death. The average intervals between two viral tests during hospital stay were 6.2 days for death cases, with 6.0 days for survivors. Currently, the US CDC recommended collecting only NP, 5 while current public health England guidance advises samples from the upper respiratory tract should be sought as NP, OP, or both in combination. 6 In the present study, the overall positive rate of NP was higher than that of OP. We also evaluated the proportion of false-negative results (negatives between two positive results during hospitalization) among all negative results. 7 The false-negative rate of OP was 10.0% (863/8596), while NP was 8.4% (78/934). However, three patients 4 have contributed 33 false-negative oropharyngeal swabs (33/78), indicating significant individual bias. Here we suggested that the nasopharyngeal specimen is the preferred choice for swab-based SARS-CoV-2 testing with higher sensibility and specificity.",

At present clinical practice, patients with improved respiratory symptoms, improved pulmonary imaging, and nucleic acid tests negative twice consecutively (sampling interval \u2265 24 hours) can be discharged. However, the data showed that people can test positive for the virus even after two consecutive negative results. Pan et al. reported that potential false-negative nucleic acid testing results for SARS-CoV-2 could be caused by thermal inactivation of samples with low viral loads. 8 According to our study, repeated viral RT-PCR testing separated by prolonged duration is needed for viral clearance evaluation. Other immunological parameters or antibody test should also be used in combined with RT-PCR negative test. Negative results must be interpreted with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.",

Therefore, the clinical sampling frequency for inpatients with COVID-19 should also be carefully evaluated. It is of great importance to evaluate the values and challenges of nucleic acid amplification tests for SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. At present, China has brought outbreaks under control with draconian measures and most patients have discharged from the hospital. Here, we reported the current status of RNA-based diagnostic testing and the pattern of viral infection and clearance in hospitalized patients, providing evidence for test utilization and diagnostic stewardship of SARS-CoV-2 tests.",

We also suggested that the persistent positive SARS-CoV-2 was associated with worse prognosis, while negative viral tests could not indicate improvements of diseases. Since positive results are indicative of active infection, further studies are required to confirm the prognostic and predictive value of positive results in inpatients. In summary, appropriate and efficient standards for testing are of great significance to prevent the sustained spread of COVID-19 and monitor disease progression for patients. Therefore, this study highlights the following observations: the nasopharyngeal specimen is the preferred choice for swab-based SARS-CoV-2 testing with higher specificity; the negative predictive value of viral tests should be carefully evaluated; the persistent positive SARS-CoV-2 was associated with worse prognosis, while negative viral tests could not indicate improvements of diseases. Most importantly, the analyses in the current study indicated that the clinical sampling frequency for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should be based on coronavirus infection and clearance pattern.
