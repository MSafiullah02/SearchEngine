            "text": "Melanosome (~500 nm in diameter) is a large unique organelle found in skin and hair melanocytes, and retinal pigment epithelial cells [1]. Melanosomes are responsible for synthesis, storage, and transport of melanin. The main roles of melanin are pigmentation (skin, hair and eye color) and defense mechanism against ultraviolet radiation and mechano-stress [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Unlike retinal epithelial cells where melanosomes are matured and the pigment is settled during development, melanocytes in skin and hair continuously produce melanosomes throughout life [1]. Originating from endosomes, melanosome is a member of lysosome-related organelles (LROs) and shares some characteristics and pathways with those of lysosome; similarities include biogenesis, maturation, trafficking (exo/endocytosis), recycling and migration [6,7]. However, melanosome biogenesis exhibits unique processes and specifically takes place in melanocytes. Newly mature melanosomes migrate from melanocytes to keratinocytes, resulting in pigmentation of epithelial cells (Fig. 1\n) [1,6,8]. As there are multiple processes, several protein molecules are involved in melanosome biogenesis, trafficking, and migration. Alterations of each corresponding molecule undoubtedly contribute to the variation of skin and eye color as well as ocular and dermatological diseases such as retinal pigment epitheliopathy, albinism, hyperpigmentation disorders, and skin cancers [4,9,10].",

Some of these membrane transport proteins including OCA2 (oculocutaneous II), SLC45A2 (solute carrier 45 member 2), SLC24A5 (solute carrier 24 member 5), TPC2 (two-pore channel protein 2) and ATP7A (copper-transporting ATPase 1) have been predicted to modulate melanosomal pH and contribute to the activity of tyrosinase (TYR), an essential protein for melanin production [11]. Previous studies indicated that mutations and polymorphisms of these transport proteins are strongly associated with oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) [4]. Until present, several causative mutations have been identified. However, the roles or transport functions of the transport proteins in melanogenesis are still poorly understood. In this review, we highlight the current progress of the research of membrane transport proteins in melanosomes and melanogenesis. Specifically, transport function, roles in melanogenesis, and significant causative mutation are summarized here. Furthermore, we predict 3D structures of the transport proteins and discuss the unknown functions of these membrane transport proteins in melanosomes.",

            "text": "Melanin is a group of pigments made up of heterogeneous polymers and is widely found in animals, plants, protozoa, eubacteria, and some fungi [5]. Melanin has a broad absorption spectrum and a high optical refractive index, enabling intriguing biological properties; such as UV light absorption and scattering, free radical scavenging, ion storage, metal chelation, and electromagnetic field sensing [2,5,12]. Animals have two major types of melanin: brown-black eumelanin and red-yellow pheomelanin. While eumelanin in the skin is the major factor contributing to skin color (dark or light skins), the ratio of eumelanin and pheomelanin in the hair determines diverse shades of hair color. Because both types of melanin have distinct chemical structures and optical properties, the response to UV radiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are different. Pheomelanin is less protective against UV radiation and ROS than eumelanin, leading to UV-radiation-dependent melanoma risk [2,13]. In addition, the intrinsic pheomelanin synthesis pathway produces UV-radiation-independent contributors to melanomagenesis [14]. Consequently, people who have red hair/fair skin (phenotypes of low eumelanin) are at greater risk for skin cancer.",

TYR also oxidizes l-DOPA into dopaquinone. Depending on the availability of l-cysteine and the function of downstream enzymes, different types of melanin are produced. The eumelanin synthesis pathway is quite well studied compared to the pheomelanin synthesis pathway. The production of eumelanin occurs in the absence of l-cysteine. Dopaquinone is converted into two intermediates: 5,6-dihydroxylindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) and 5,6-dihydroxyl indole (DHI), then finally converted to eumelanin. These processes require enzymatic reactions of TYR and two other enzymes, dopachrome tautomerase (DCT/TYRP2/TRP2) and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1/TRP1). In the presence of l-cysteine, dopaquinone is converted into cysteinylDOPA instead. The cysteinylDOPA passes several enzymatic reactions involving oxidation and polymerization yielding pheomelanin (Fig. 2) [4,15,16].",

TYR is known to be controlled by either mRNA expression or protein function. TYR mRNA expression is regulated via the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)-dependent cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway. MC1R is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) on melanocytes that senses melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and mediates cAMP signaling to regulate the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). MITF thereby regulates the TYR mRNA expression as well as other aspects of melanosomes/melanocytes [3,18]. Functional control of TYR protein is accomplished by modulation of melanosomal pH because TYR activity is solely dependent on pH. Neutral pH preserves TYR and TYRPs functions, while acidic pH suppresses TYR function without altering its expression (discussed in later section). Zhou et al. reported that the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC)-dependent pathway negatively modulates melanin production by decreasing the pH of melanosomes [19].",

Melanosomes at stages I\u2013II, also called premelanosomes, lack melanin production but contain the formation of amyloid fibrils composed of the melanocyte protein PMEL (also known as PMEL17 and gp100). The characteristic of melanosomes at stage I is similar to the early endosome, which contains intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). In this stage, PMEL is cleaved into M\u03b1 and M\u03b2 fragments. The M\u03b1 fragments dissociate from the luminal domain and start to nucleate at the ILVs to form tiny non-rearranged fibrils. During stage II, the formation of the fibrils, called PMEL fibrils, is completed. PMEL fibrils are organized and elongated as arrays of parallel sheets in an ellipsoidal shape of melanosome, serving as a matrix for melanin deposition which is initiated at stage III and completed at stage IV (Fig. 1) [7,21]. At stage III, several enzymes (TYR, TYRP1 and TYRP2) and ion transport proteins (ATP7A, OCA2, SLC45A2 and TPC2) for melanogenesis are sorted from trans-Golgi network to melanosome, and then, melanogenesis begins [11,20,22,23]. Synthesized melanin moves on and covers the PMEL fibrils completely at stage III and thickens and darkens as shown at stage IV. In skin, the mature melanosomes enter the process of migration from melanocytes to keratinocytes resulting in the spread of skin colors [1,5,6,8]. In hair follicles, stages of melanosome biogenesis, melanogenesis and melanosome transfer are similar to those of melanocytes in epidermis. Melanosome biogenesis occurs in follicular melanocytes located in hair bulbs during the anagen stage of hair cycle. Due to the distinct anatomic compartments, follicular melanocytes have more dendritic, extensive Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum, and produce larger mature melanosomes than epidermal melanocytes [24].",

The function of a transport protein relies on the electrochemical gradients. Channels selectively facilitate passive diffusion. Active transport systems move the substances against their electrochemical gradients. Primary active transport proteins hydrolyze ATP to mediate active transport. Secondary active transport proteins utilize energy from the electrochemical gradients, such as Na+, to drive the active transport. Tertiary active transport proteins mediate exchange or cotransport by using the energy derived from the chemical gradients generated by the secondary active transport proteins [25]. The maintenance of ion homeostasis requires the combinational function of ion transport proteins. In melanosomes, ions are indispensable factors that define the nature of the organelle for melanogenesis as well as its biogenesis. The ions and their transport proteins contribute to enzymatic reactions, redox reaction, electrical signaling, metal and ionic homeostasis, and pH maintenance. In the following section, the roles of both ions and ion transport proteins for melanosomes are discussed.",

Premelanosomes exhibit acidic pH while stages III\u2013IV melanosomes show neutral pH. PMEL fibrils are rapidly formed under strict acidic condition of premelanosomes [26,27]. However, TYR and TYRPs, which are expressed in stages III\u2013IV melanosomes, are active at neutral pH and have diminished activity in acidic conditions [[28], [29], [30], [31]]. Neutral pH promotes eumelanin synthesis by maintaining the full activity of TYR as observed in melanosomes of the melanocytes from Black skin. In contrast, melanosomes of melanocytes from Caucasians are more acidic, and their TYR is largely inactive. Rescue experiments using NH4Cl to increase melanosomal pH confirmed the importance of pH in TYR activity. Caucasian melanocytes treated with NH4Cl show an increase of TYR activity whereas Black melanocytes do not change the TYR activity with NH4Cl treatment [30]. Acidification also suppresses the eumelanin synthesis at the later steps after dopachrome (Fig. 2) [31]. Moreover, weak acidic pH promotes the pheomelanin production pathway [32]. These results demonstrate that during melanosome maturation at stages II\u2013III the melanosomal pH changes from acidic to neutral thereby terminating PMEL polymerization steps and, instead, initiating TYR function.",

            "text": "In physiological condition, stages III\u2013IV melanosomes would express a transport protein(s) that fluxes H+ out. SLC45A2 (MATP/AIM1) is the most promising molecule. SLC45A2 belongs to the H+/sugar cotransporter family [36]. Knockdown of SLC45A2 results in melanosomal acidification, which interrupts TYR activity in the cell models [37]. In albino zebrafish with a SLC45A2 mutation, the TYR activity is disrupted, but rescued by reinjection of SLC45A2 mRNA or bafilomycin treatment [35]. Although SLC45A2 transport activity in melanosomes is unclear, it is proposed that SLC45A2 effluxes H+ coupled with substrates and neutralizes the pH of stages III\u2013IV melanosomes (Fig. 3\n). Additionally, voltage-gated Cl\u2212/H+ exchangers (ClCs) and Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) may be candidates participating in H+ export. ClC-7 mediates H+ efflux in lysosome to control lysosomal pH. Mutation in ClC-7 gene causes hyperacidification and results in albinism [38]. Thus, it is possible that ClC-7 is also expressed in melanosomes. NHE3 and NHE7 are colocalized with TYRP1 in melanocytes, although the function of NHEs in melanosomes has not yet been demonstrated [39].",

However, several studies clearly indicate that multiple ion transport proteins participate in the regulation of melanosomal pH (Fig. 3). OCA type 2 (OCA2/P) and SLC45A2 (MATP/AIM1) proteins are reported to be positive regulators for pH neutralization [35,40]. Two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) was found to be a negative regulator for pH neutralization [41]. OCA2 and TPC2 are ion transport proteins but may not directly transport H+. The proposed roles and functions of these proteins are discussed in later section.",

TYR contains two Cu2+ binding sites, and TYRPs hold two Zn2+ binding sites [15,16]. The requirement of Cu2+ ions for TYR has been clearly demonstrated. Binding of two Cu2+ ions and an oxygen molecule in TYR enables the redox properties on oxidation states of monooxygenase and oxidase activities [15]. While TYR requires Cu2+, TYRP2 tautomerase activity requires Zn2+ [42]. The binding of metal ions to TYRP1 is still controversial. TYRP1 contains Zn2+ binding sites but biochemical experiments have failed to prove the direct binding of Zn2+ [43]. Moreover, mouse and human TYRP1 seem to exhibit different enzymatic properties [16]. Nevertheless, both Cu2+ and Zn2+ are bona fide cofactors of enzymatic reactions in melanosomal tyrosinase family.",

In stages III\u2013IV melanosomes, Ca2+ might be one of the coupling ions for pH modulation. The role of Ca2+ is not limited to melanogenesis in melanosomes but is also involved in the signaling responses between melanosomes and melanocytes. Ca2+ is known to be a secondary messenger that contributes to signaling pathways and membrane voltage. In non-melanocyte cells, intracellular Ca2+ is stored in organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and lysosome [51]. Melanosome is found to be another organellar Ca2+ store in melanocytes due to the high accumulation of Ca2+ in melanosomes and properties of Ca2+ binding to melanin [[52], [53], [54]]. The enriched Ca2+ in melanosomes is released by stimulants such as caffeine and IP3 [53]. The \u03b1-MSH pathway, for instance, is a Ca2+ response mechanism for TYR expression [55]. These results support the significance of melanosomal Ca2+ in Ca2+-mediated signaling pathways and Ca2+ homeostasis between melanosomes and melanocytes, which may be involved in melanogenesis.",

The pH regulation by OCA2 targets V-ATPase as observed in the rescue of TYR function after V-ATPase inhibition in OCA2-knockout melanocytes [28,29,34,69,70]. Besides pH regulation, OCA2 likely facilitates TYR trafficking from ER/Golgi network to melanosomes. The OCA2-knockout melanocytes show some TYR retaining on ER/Golgi network, and the melanosomal re-localization of TYR could be rescued by pH modulation [[69], [70], [71], [72]]. All data point to the dual roles of OCA2-dependent pH regulation\u2014for both TYR trafficking and TYR activities.",

Bellono et al. demonstrated that OCA2 mediates Cl\u2212-selective anion conductance by using the patch clamp method with OCA2-knockdown melanosomes dissected from Oa1\n\u2212/\u2212 melanocyte (melanocytes with enlarged melanosomes). OCA2 induces large outwardly rectifying current with a negative charge of Cl\u2212. This Cl\u2212 conductance is essential for maintaining neutral pH for melanosomes. In the addition, electrophysiological property has been characterized in the endolysosome of the recombinant OCA2-expressing AD-293 cells suggesting that OCA2 is an electrodiffusion anion channel [40].",

Hundreds of mutations are identified in humans (Albinism Database: http://www.ifpcs.org, last update September 2009; The Human Gene Mutation Database: http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk, last update April 2019). The pathogenic phenotypes include hypopigmentation of skin and hair, reduced iris and retinal pigments, and ocular defect (Lewis RA. Gene Reviews, last update August 2012: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1343/). At the cellular level, the patient has small melanocytes, immature melanosomes, and no or little melanin production. Examples of pathogenic mutations are V443I, P743L, and A481T. Patients with V443I and P743L double mutations develop severe phenotypes of type II OCA and Prader-Willi syndrome [76]. A481T, a mutation associated with mild-symptom phenotypes, is commonly found in Caucasians as well as in East Asians [[76], [77], [78]]. Polymorphisms of OCA2 give rise to diverse variations of eyes, hair, and skin colors such as blue eyes (Table 1) [79,80].",

Although both aspects could be independent, the role of SLC45A2 in the pH regulation is certain. Based on the current information, SLC45A2 is predicted to efflux H+ from melanosomes (Fig. 3) [36,37,85]. If so, the H+ efflux by SLC45A2 reduces melanosomal H+ concentration driven by V-ATPase, thereby neutralizing the melanosomal pH.

The most frequent mutations are D93N, D157N, and G188V, which result in light/yellow/white/blue hair, blue/red/brown/gray eye color, and some nystagmus. A477V causes leucism in lions and tigers, and the mutation (A477T) has been reported once in humans [90,91]. We constructed a 3D structure model of the SLC45A2 by using lactose permease (LacY; PDB No. 5GXB) as a template (Fig. 4\n) [92]. The model contains 12 transmembrane domains (TM) with the conserved structural fold of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Two bundles, (TM 1, 4, 5) and (TM 7, 10, 11), are arranged in pseudosymmetry and form a presumable substrate binding site, while residues on TM 7, 9 and 10 may be involved in proton coupling and transfer.

There are three proposed mechanisms for how SLC24A5 supplies the ions to melanosomes based on its subcellular localization. The first possibility is that SLC24A5 in trans-Golgi network plays a role in pH regulation by functional coupling with NHE7 and V-ATPase. This functional coupling may ensure the TYR maturation and proper trafficking of TYR from trans-Golgi network to melanosomes [97]. Another possibility is based on SLC24A5 localization in melanosomes as mentioned in the previous section; SLC24A5 supplies Ca2+ to promote PMEL polymerization and maintain Ca2+ homeostasis as well as membrane potential in melanosomes [94]. The third possibility is derived from the localization of SLC24A5 in mitochondria. SLC24A5 may transfer Ca2+ from mitochondria to melanosome via \u201cmitochondrion-melanosome contact\u201d [61,101].",

The patients have hypopigmentation, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, hair color ranging from platinum blond to light brown, and green or blue eye color. Pathogenic mutations are, for examples, A115E, R174K, S182R, and W197X. However, these patients have non-syndromic OCA [95,102]. Polymorphism of SLC24A5 is related to regions. A111 is found to be associated with light skin pigmentation among European and East Asians. The variation is approximately 20\u201340% of European-African difference in skin melanin index. T111 is commonly found in Europeans while A111 is common in Africans and East Asians [94].",

Models of eukaryotic NCXs and NCKXs show a set of 10 TMs similar to NCX_Mj, and two additional regions\u2014(1) N-terminal region, which contains a single transmembrane domain (called TM0) and a signal peptide sequence (SPase cleavage site) between TM0 and TM1, may be cleft out; and (2) large cytosolic regulatory f-loop containing two Ca2+ binding domains (~500 amino acids) between TM5 and TM6 which functions as a Ca2+-sensing domain [100,103]. We, therefore, constructed a 3D structural model of SLC24A5 using the structure of NCX_Mj (PDB No. 3V5U) as the template. We aligned amino acid sequences of SLC24A5 to NCX_Mj, and other human NCKXs. The feasible N-terminal region and cytosolic f-loop are omitted from the model. The model shows 10 TM domains which are well aligned to NCX_Mj structure (Fig. 5).",

A111, A115, R174, and S182 are located on TM4 and TM6 which are at the outer array of the core substrate binding TMs (TM2\u20133 and TM7\u20138). W197 is located at the top of TM7 but far away from the center. We suggest that these residues are not involved with the substrate recognition; therefore, the mutation may not severely cause the loss of transport activity. The position of mutation residues likely explains why the patients with A115E, R174K, S182R, and W197X exhibit mild symptoms and A111T only causes variety of hair and skin colors.",

TPC2 (752 amino acids) is an organellar transporter localized in endosome, endolysosome, lysosome and melanosome and ubiquitously expressed in most tissues [41,58,59]. The 3D cryo-EM structure of TPC2 reveals the dimerization of TPC2 forming a tetramer-like voltage-sensing channel. Each subunit comprises two sets of homologous 6-TM domains. The voltage sensing domain is from TM1\u20134 helices. TM5 and TM6 from each set of protomers assemble to form a central ion conduction pore [105]. Unlike TPC1 and TPC3, TPC2 functions as a voltage-independent cation channel, meaning that the channel is opened in response only to the binding of its ligands, independently from membrane potential [[105], [106], [107]]. The opened channel allows the cation (Na+ or Ca2+) to flow across from lumen to cytosol (cation conductance).",

            "text": "The TPC2-regulating pathway in non-pigmented cells has been studied quite intensively, although the recognized ligands and ionic substrates of TPC2 are still controversial. TPC2 is found to be a receptor for either nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or PI(3,5)P2 or both [108,109]. Both NAADP and PI(3,5)P2 are intracellular second messengers in response to various stimuli. NAADP-sensing TPC2 mediates Ca2+ release in lysosome and endolysosome [58,59,[110], [111], [112], [113], [114]]. PI(3,5)P2-dependent TPC activation induces Na+ release [105,[115], [116], [117], [118]]. Despite the difference of stimuli and responsive ions, most studies demonstrate the common role of TPC2 in lysosomal stability and pH maintenance, implying the significance of TPC2 on lysosomal protein functions. Malfunction of TPC2 results in impairment of lysosomal acidification. Upstream molecules that regulate TPC2 are, for example, VEGF, mTOR, p38, and MAPK [113,119,120]. TPC2 has a wide effect on cellular activities such as cell invasion, autophagy, muscle contraction, and angiogenesis [112,118,119,121]. Notably, TPC2 is a target for Ebola virus and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infectivity and treatment [[122], [123], [124]].",

            "text": "Both TPC1 and TPC2 were initially discovered as associated genes for genetic pigmentation in Europeans, but only TPC2 has been confirmed to exist in melanosomes [41,125,126]. Studies in melanosomes bring a similar debate to those in non-melanocyte's lysosomes about preferable stimulants and ions of TPC2. By using oocyte and melanocyte models, Lin et al. and Ambrosio et al. showed that TPC2 mediates Ca2+ release in response to NAADP [41,60]. Meanwhile, Bellono et al. demonstrated the PI(3,5)P2 activates TPC2-mediated Na+-selective conductance [126]. The response to PI(3,5)P2 is further observed in a TPC2-expressing endolysosome models [63]. Nevertheless, loss of TPC2 clearly affects melanosomal pH and size, and melanin production. Likewise, TPC2 plays a role in pH maintenance by acting as a negative regulator for melanin production and pH neutralization (TPC2 promotes acidic pH) [41,126]. It is postulated that TPC2 generates membrane voltage (membrane potential) by the positive conductance, thus, controlling the function of V-ATPase for H+ influx. The combinational function of the negative regulator TPC2 and the positive regulator OCA2 is also proposed to control melanosomal pH [126]. The anion conductance by OCA2 could be counterbalanced with the cation conductance by TPC2 in order to modulate V-ATPase function thereby maintaining ion and pH homeostasis inside the melanosomes (Fig. 3).",

ATP7A is a primary active transport protein that utilizes ATP hydrolysis to mediate Cu2+ transport out of the cytosol. ATP7A is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and plays a central role in controlling Cu2+ balance in the cells. Cu2+ is an essential cofactor for enzymatic functions, however, excessive amounts of Cu2+ lead to tissue toxicity such as liver diseases and neurological defects [62,127,128]. Accordingly, cells need to restrict cellular Cu2+ homeostasis, and thus, ATP7A is critical. ATP7A has dual functions; in non-pigmented cells, ATP7A is trafficked between plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network via exocytosis and endocytosis [129]. Under normal conditions, ATP7A resides in the trans-Golgi network and supplies Cu2+ to the Cu2+-dependent proteins (so called cuproproteins) such as cytochrome C oxidase and superoxide dismutase [130,131]. In the presence of an exceeding amount of Cu2+, ATP7A is translocated to the plasma membrane and transports Cu2+ out of the cell. When Cu2+ returns to physiological level, ATP7A is relocated back to trans-Golgi network [128,[132], [133], [134]]. At the blood-brain barrier, ATP7A is trafficked to the basolateral membrane to promote Cu2+ delivery to the brain. ATP7A plays important roles in neuron activation, angiotensin-II-associated hypertension, cisplatin resistance and hepatic Cu2+ mobilization [62].",

The Cu2+ binding sites are located inside the M domain. All members of copper-ATPases contain N-terminal 6 heavy metal binding domains, which may be involved in autoinhibition and trafficking rather than Cu2+ transport [135]. Importantly, ATP7A contains a lumenal loop located between MA and MB called HM loop (His- and Met-rich loop) which is absent in ATP7B, another copper-transporting ATPase [135,136]. HM loop likely mimics the function of metallochaperones by serving itself as a platform for Cu2+ transferring from ATP7A to cuproproteins directly without specific chaperones. His and Met in HM loop are potential copper ligands, and they undergo His-to-Met ligand switching via His protonation in different pH. This pH-sensitive HM loop thereby accommodates conformational flexibility allowing Cu2+ transfer to different cuproproteins that exhibit optimal functions at different pH, e.g. metalation to TYR in neutral pH and PHM (peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase) in acidic pH [136].",

ATP7A is translocated from trans-Golgi network to melanosomes via BLOC-1 containing cargo which also sorts TYRP1 and OCA2 [22]. As described, Cu2+ is an indispensable cofactor for TYR function. Previous studies demonstrated that TYR exhibits as Cu2+-bound form since it is located in trans-Golgi network (prior to translocation to the melanosome), and Cu2+ is continuously supplied to TYR to ensure TYR function in stages III\u2013IV melanosomes [137]. Setty et al. confirmed that melanosomal ATP7A transports Cu2+ from cytosol to the lumen, thereby supplying Cu2+ to TYR during melanosome maturation (Fig. 3) [22]. One question remains to be addressed: how does TYR get Cu2+ loading during its localization in trans-Golgi network? ATP7A may be involved in this action as well because ATP7A and TYR coexist in the trans-Golgi network. Additionally, ATP7A is active in broad-range pH due to its H+-controlling switch in HM loop [136]. Taken together, ATP7A may be functional to continuously supply Cu2+ to TYR at both trans-Golgi networks and melanosomes.",

The classical form phenotype is characterized by progressive neurological degeneration, osteoporosis, connective tissue defect, spare hypopigmented hair, hypopigmented skin, and retinal degradation. The milder form is termed OHS, which has connective tissue abnormalities [62]. At present, more than 100 mutations have been reported.",

We describe both the functional properties of ion transport proteins and the roles of the ion substrates. All ion transport proteins unite their unique functions to grant the central goal\u2014to promote TYR function. TYR is the key enzyme for melanogenesis. TYR function is solely dependent on neutral pH and the existence of Cu2+ as a cofactor. All ion transport proteins play significant roles in this respect. ATP7A simply transports Cu2+ to supply Cu2+ to TYR. OCA2, SLC45A2 and TPC2 (perhaps also SLC24A5) are important for pH maintenance. Although the mechanism of pH regulation remains unclear, the goal of the transport proteins is simple\u2014to change the acidic pH in premelanosomes to neutral pH in stages III\u2013IV melanosomes. To modulate pH, OCA2, SLC45A2, and TPC2 likely need to function together in a so called \u201ccombinational function of ion transport proteins\u201d. Based on the present information, we propose the model of combinational function of ion transport proteins for the pH maintenance in stages III\u2013IV melanosomes (Fig. 3).",

To elucidate the combinational function of multiple ion transport proteins, understanding of the functional properties of each transport protein is crucial. Therefore, further characterization of the transport proteins is a must. Comprehensive studies of protein-protein interactions by mass spectrometry, so-called interactomics, will explain the combinational function of the ion transport proteins. Future genomic and transcriptomic studies may identify more gene candidates and fill the remaining pieces of the Jigsaw puzzle in melanogenesis. The latest advance in structure biology will give us structural information of the ion transport proteins in detail, which may suggest the transport mechanism of proteins. Most importantly, although it is not easy to dissect transport functions of organellar transport proteins, the transport function of the ion transporters can be revealed by using a classical biochemical method, the cell-free transport assay with proteoliposomes, purified protein-reconstituted liposomes as shown by Moriyama or others [141,142]. Recently, MFSD12 (major facilitator superfamily domain containing protein 12) was identified as an associated gene in pigmentation in African population by GWAS [143,144]. In addition to the ion transport proteins we described above, MFSD12 requires characterization of its function and role in melanocytes. The melanosomal transport proteins provide a large number of open questions to us.",

Melanogenesis takes place in melanosome, a unique organelle in melanocytes. Melanosome is developed from the early endosome. Melanosome formation and maturation are called biogenesis, which is composed of four stages. Stages I\u2013II are the nonpigmented stages of melanosomes, called premelanosomes. In premelanosomes, PMEL fibrils are formed (stage I), and completely organized as parallel sheets in ellipsoidal shape (stage II). Melanogenesis pathway begins at stage III, the stage which TYR along with TYRPs, ATP7A, OCA2, SLC45A2, and TPC2 are translocated from trans-Golgi network to melanosomes. The premelanosomes have acidic pH, but stages III\u2013IV melanosomes have neutral pH, which may be a result of combinational function of the newly deposited ion transport proteins. Under neutral pH, TYR is functional and melanin is synthesized. Synthesized melanins fully mask on PMEL fibrils at stage IV, resulting in mature melanosome. Mature melanosomes are delivered to keratinocytes and are distributed throughout the skin.",
