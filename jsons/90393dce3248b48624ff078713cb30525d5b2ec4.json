For a second run of experiments, tissue samples from different parts of the kidney were dissected/microdissected in biologically representative compartments, including cortex, medulla, tubulo-interstitium, and glomeruli. These samples were then stored at 4\u00b0C in RNA later solution (ThermoFisher; AM7021-500ML). All tissue samples were grinded (Precellys 24, Bertin, Rockville, US) using 2ml tubes prefilled with ceramic beads (Precellys Lysing Kit) and 1ml RNA and DNA free PCR grade water. For RNA/DNA extraction 200\u00b5l of the grinded tissue lysate or whole blood was transferred to the MagnaPure96 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Automated nucleic acid extraction was performed according to manufacturers' recommendation with whole process control (Roche control Kit) and final elution volume was 100\u00b5l. For virus quantification a previously published assay was adopted with modifications using chimeric 2'-O-methyl RNA bases at the penultimate base of both primers (mG and mC) to reduce primer dimer formation 3 . Briefly the forward primer, 5\u00b4-ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCmGT-3 (400nM end concentration), 5\u00b4TATTGCAGCAGTACGCACAmCA-3\u00b4 (400nM end concentration) and probe 5\u00b4-Fam-ACACTAGCC/ZEN/ATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-Iowa Black FQ-3' (100nM end concentration) were used. Primer and Probes were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Leuven, Belgium). One-step RT-PCR (25\u00b5l volume) was run on the LightCycler480 system (Roche) using one step RNA control kit as master mix (Roche) and 5 \u00b5l of eluate. Ct value for the target SARS-CoV-2 RNA (FAM) was determined using second derivative maximum method. For quantification standard in-vitro transcribed RNA (IVT-RNA) of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 was used. The standard was obtained via the European Virus Archive 4 . Linear range of the assay is between 1x10 3 and 1x10 9 copies/ml. Quantitative \u03b2-globin PCR was performed with commercial TaqMan primer set (Thermo-Fischer, 401846) and Roche DNA control kit. PCR was run on the LightCycler480 system. The amount of DNA was normalized using human DNA standard (KR0454). SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in tissues were normalized to b-globin DNA to adjust for differences in tissue input.",

Probes for housekeeping genes were used to assess RNA integrity (GAPDH #442201; B2M #484661-C2) and unrelated probes targeting the hepatitis delta virus genomic and antigenomic RNA (#469771; #433471-C2) as negative controls (Fig. S3) . Viral protein was detected in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections using a protocol for indirect immunofluorescence as previously described 7 . We used two commercially available antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 detection: spike glycoprotein antibody [3A2] (Abcam, ab272420) and SARS-CoV S\u039410 within S2 domain protein (Genetex, GTX632604). In every round we included a negative control by incubating the samples only in secondary fluorescent probes without primary antibody (Fig. S4 ). An antibody against Nephrin, a podocyte specific protein, was used as a reference (Progen biotechnic; GP-N2). It is worth noting that these techniques were performed within the limitations of existing tissue preservation in autopsy samples (e.g. levels of autolysis, fixation and overall tissue preservation).
