Perfect nestedness means that all species observed in depauperate sites will be found in all richer locations. While perfect nestedness is very rare in nature, the degree of nestedness can be measured and significance assessed using simulations based on null models. Nestedness requires three conditions: species possess a shared biogeographic history, habitats are somewhat comparable, and species are hierarchical in distribution and frequency (Patterson and Brown 1991). Since nestedness refers to a condition of ordered composition, any factor that serves to create heterogeneity will reduce the propensity for nestedness (Mikkelson 1993, Wright et al. 1998). As such, the first two conditions serve as homogeneity constraints on species and sites, respectively; the third condition acts as a filter and reflects the factors that lead species to have variable incidences (Wright et al. 1998).",

Darlington (1957) was the first to recognize a nested pattern among oceanic archipelagos and attributed this to the differential colonization of islands by species. Since dispersal abilities differ among species, more isolated islands would only contain those taxa capable of long\u2010distance dispersal over the ocean or an otherwise inhospitable matrix. Extinction of species could also produce nested communities if vulnerability to population collapse differs among species. The area of available habitat acts to constrain population size by dictating an approximate maximum number of individuals capable of being supported on an island (Preston 1962). Small populations tend to be more vulnerable to stochastic extinction events (MacArthur and Wilson 1967, Gilpin and Soul\u00e9 1986, Fischer and St\u00f6cklin 1997, Menges and Dolan 1998, Gray et al. 2003, Matthies et al. 2004).",

            "text": "While colonization and extinction imply the dynamic processes of assembly and disassembly, nestedness can reflect other underlying ecological patterns. Sites differing in habitat heterogeneity can form nested subsets if less common habitats support taxa specific to those habitats (Worthen 1996). Thus, sites containing common and rare habitat types may contain both habitat generalists and specialists, while more homogeneous sites would only contain generalist species. Finally, when species consistently differ in their relative commonness and rarity without regard to habitat (Preston 1962), they can form nested assemblages, since common species simply have a higher probability of occupying any given site via passive sampling (Connor and McCoy 1979). These potential mechanisms are probabilistic filters (Wright et al. 1998): habitat nestedness acts to filter habitats, passive sampling is an abundance filter, and isolation and area filters reflect the tendencies for species to differ in their colonization or extinction behavior, respectively. Circumstances over space and time determine whether one or more filters will produce a consistent ordering of species across sites and a nested structure.",

            "text": "The difficulty is how to distinguish which of those filters are primarily responsible for an observed nestedness pattern. The ecological context of an archipelago can be considered as a simple a priori indication of which dynamic process is potentially operating. Archipelagos representing contracted remnants of a formerly continuous environment supporting shared species, such as land bridge islands and fragmented landscapes, should develop a nested pattern resulting from differential extinction rates between taxa (Patterson 1987). On the other hand, oceanic islands formed in isolation from other land masses should exhibit nestedness primarily as a result of colonization (Cook and Quinn 1995). While some studies have demonstrated colonization as a driving mechanism (e.g., Kadmon 1995, Butaye et al. 2001, Loo et al. 2002), extinction has more often been indicated (Wright et al. 1998).",

However, there is no strong indication, whether through theoretical deduction or empirical demonstration, that different mechanisms would produce fundamentally different nestedness scores (Simberloff and Martin 1991). A more promising approach is to analyze the rank\u2010order correlations between the nested order of sites and candidate independent variables (Lomolino 1996, Patterson et al. 1996, Sfenthourakis et al. 1999, Rodr\u00edguez\u2010Giron\u00e9s and Santamar\u00eda 2006). Significant correlations between the nested order of sites and isolation distance or area could indicate the influence of colonization and extinction, respectively, under two fundamental assumptions of island biogeography theory (MacArthur and Wilson 1967): extinction probability declines with increasing area, and the likelihood of immigration decreases with greater isolation (Lomolino 1996).",

Evidence of an area effect alone cannot disentangle extinction from passive sampling. The most convincing evidence of extinction at the island level would arise from the demonstration of declines in species richness or the loss of specific taxa over time; such evidence is not available for this study. Thus, we cannot distinguish between extinction and passive sampling with these data.",

Increases in elevation within this study area are accompanied by an increase in mean particle size in the rockier soils on mountains and hilltops, which retards evaporation and promotes deeper percolation of rain water (Shreve and Wiggins 1964), resulting in greater water availability to plants. Thus, elevation is a surrogate for productivity. Higher productivity can result in a greater density of individuals, which can passively sample more species. Also, multiple woody species that thrive at higher altitudes are not observed on lower slopes and plains due to moisture limitation. Hence, sites with wider ranges in elevation potentially offer a broader productivity gradient and an increase in island species richness.",

Urban systems also offer a valuable context in which to study phenomena that have concerned ecologists for decades, such as how habitat fragmentation affects community composition. Nestedness analysis offers a useful means by which to assess how composition is structured. This study determined whether nestedness exists for woody vegetation among remnant islands in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and what mechanisms may be responsible for the nested pattern. While there has been an increase in attention paid to nestedness in plants, no studies have yet examined this pattern in an urban environment.",

On the other hand, if different species respond to divergent mechanisms, this may indicate that multiple determinants combine effects to contribute to nestedness of the community at large. To our knowledge, this study is the first one to explore the relationship between species abundance and community nestedness.",

All islands consisted of Sonoran Desert habitat, possibly disturbed in the past but never developed, surrounded by residential and commercial land covers. Due to the prevalence of disturbance associated with development, impermeable surfaces, and common planting of nonnative horticultural plants, the intervening urban matrix is exceedingly inhospitable to the migration of native desert plant species. Most patches are mountainous parks dedicated to preserving natural habitat for recreation and conservation. Mountains in this system rise to a maximum of \u223c500 m from base to summit, with most substantially lower.

The number of woody individuals identified to species was recorded for each quadrat. Species abundance was calculated as the per site mean number of individuals present per 100 square meters. Transects were stratified by geomorphic type, which includes: slopes facing one of the four cardinal directions, flatlands, and ephemeral washes.

Polygons were designated to encompass areas containing continuous expanses of the desert environment lacking urban features as barriers. A contour map with 10\u2010m intervals, generated using ArcGIS (2002) and derived from the Maricopa County Digital Elevation Model (DEM; available online)\n4\n was used in conjunction with the aerial photos to aid in interpretation. Reliance on two\u2010dimensional GIS layers alone would distort the relationship between polygons by overemphasizing flatter areas at the expense of steeper slopes. To compensate for this distortion, the three\u2010dimensional surface areas of each polygon were estimated by dividing the two\u2010dimensional area by the cosine of the mean slope for that polygon; the Maricopa DEM was converted into a map of slope values, at 30\u2010m resolution, and the mean was calculated for each polygon.",

Habitat diversity for each island was calculated using the Shannon index (Magurran 1988), which incorporated the proportion of total surface area covered by each geomorphic type\u2013soil class. Isolation was calculated as: I = \u03a3 [ln(Area)/(Distance2)], where distance extended from the edge of the focal island to the edge of other islands or to the nearest expanse of outlying desert. For this purpose, the area of the outlying desert was assumed to be 9000 ha, which is approximately equal to the area of the largest island, South Mountain Park. The isolation index was intended to express the potential for a given patch to exchange propagules with other source areas and facilitate establishment of new species; this potential decreases with longer distances between sites and increases with larger areas bearing more plants and richer communities of animal vectors.",

The NTC has been criticized by multiple authors for being overly biased toward finding significant nestedness in field data from the use of unrealistic null matrices, resulting in a higher probability of Type I statistical errors (Cook and Quinn 1998, Brualdi and Sanderson 1999, Jonsson 2001, Fischer and Lindenmayer 2002). Rodr\u00edguez\u2010Giron\u00e9s and Santamar\u00eda (2006) created a new algorithm, BINMATNEST, which addresses criticisms of the NTC and uses three different null matrices as described in Atmar and Patterson (1993), Fischer and Lindenmayer (2002), and their own paper. Their program, available as a supplement to their paper, was used in order to compare nestedness scores using different metrics.

Nestedness analysis using the NTC and BINMATNEST is based on presence\u2013absence data at the community level. We hypothesized that species responding to mechanisms structuring nestedness will have dwindling abundance down the gradient until they are ultimately lacking on depauperate islands, reflective of their extinction in less hospitable sites. Alternatively, species may be rare or absent in sites lacking certain environments, leading to nestedness reflective of the availability of growth conditions.

For the three habitats in which the four species achieve peak mean abundance, total area of each habitat within a site was significantly correlated with nested rank\u2010order: north\u2010facing slope (0.458; n = 17), east\u2010facing slope (0.534; n = 14), and wash (0.763; n = 14). The two species with negative correlations in Table 3, Larrea tridentata and Prosopsis velutina, also had negative relationships in this analysis.",

A multitude of mechanisms appear to contribute to the nested pattern, though their relative roles are unknown. Additionally, for these long\u2010lived species, how much of their community structure was determined before or after fragmentation? The extent to which species distributions were directly affected by fragmentation or existed prior to the separation of the sites is uncertain. A potential approach would be to designate and sample control areas similar in dimensions to this system's archipelago in continuous desert terrain to enable comparison (e.g., Harrison 1997). However, it would be difficult to match the distinctive altitudinal and biogeographic site characteristics to allow comparability between the patchy and control areas in this case. A detailed demographic survey, preferably over a lengthy time scale, would be useful for better characterizing the current state and projecting the future status of remnant populations.",
