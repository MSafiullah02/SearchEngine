Despite binding to different receptors, IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 use the same signaling pathways. However, apart from these important similarities, IL\u201018 and IL\u20101\u03b2 appear to have a different biology.4, 6, 7\n",

Transcription of IL\u201018 precursor can be induced after TLR binding of PAMPs and activation of the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway. IL\u201018 gene encodes for a 193 amino acids precursor, first synthesized as an inactive 24\u2010kDa precursor with no signal peptide, which accumulates in cell cytoplasm. In contrast with IL\u20101\u03b2, the IL\u201018 precursor is constitutively present in blood monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells from healthy subjects.6, 8 Similarly to IL\u20101\u03b1 and IL\u201033, the IL\u201018 precursor is constitutively expressed in endothelial cells, keratinocytes or intestinal epithelial cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract and remains in the intracellular compartment of mesenchymal cells.",

Caspase 1 can be activated by various canonical inflammasomes belonging to the Nod\u2010like receptors, AIM2\u2010like receptors or TRIM family containing either a CARD or a PYD domain.11 Among the best known inflammasomes are NLRP\u20103, NLRC4, NLRP\u20101 and AIM2 which sense various danger signals. Caspase 1 activation also results in a cell\u2010death program termed pyroptosis, which induces membrane pores and mature IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018 release. Mature IL\u20101\u03b2 can also be released from the cells by lysosome exocytosis or membrane microvesicles, but it is not clear whether IL\u201018 used the same pathways. Caspase 1\u2010independent mechanisms of IL\u201018 cleavage have also been described. Notably, Fas Ligand activation of Fas\u2010expressing Kupffer cells or splenic macrophages from Propiobacterium acnes\u2010infected mice, can process active IL\u201018 in a caspase 1\u2010independent but caspase 8\u2010mediated fashion.12, 13 Alternatively, caspase 3 cleaves IL\u201018 precursor and mature forms in inactive fragments.14 In addition, granzyme B from cytotoxic cells, chymase from mast cells or meprin \u03b2 from intestinal and kidney epithelial cells can cleave IL\u201018 precursor in biologically active forms.15, 16, 17 IL\u201018 can also be released in its precursor form from dying cells and processed extracellularly in an active form by neutrophil proteases such as proteinase 3.18\n",

IL\u201018R\u03b2 is expressed on T\u2010cells and dendritic cells but not commonly expressed in mesenchymal cells. Following the formation of the heterodimer, the Toll\u2010IL\u20101 receptor (TIR) domains approximate and it appears that the cascade of sequential recruitment of MyD88, the four IRAKs and TRAF\u20106 followed by the degradation of I\u03baB and release of NF\u03baB are nearly identical as that for IL\u20101.21 However, there are differences between IL\u20101 and IL\u201018 signaling. With few exceptions, IL\u20101\u03b1 or IL\u20101\u03b2 are active on cells in the low nanogram/mL range and often in the picogram/mL range. In contrast, IL\u201018 activation of cells expressing the two IL\u201018 receptor chains requires 10 to 20 ng/mL and sometime higher levels.22\n",

Present in the serum of healthy humans at a 20\u2010fold molar excess compared to IL\u201018, IL\u201018BP may contribute to a default mechanism by which a Th1 response to foreign organisms is blunted in order to reduce triggering an autoimmune responses to a routine infection.55 Although IL\u201018BP is readily secreted, it falls into the functional category of being a shed soluble receptor. As shown in Figure 1, IL\u201018BP contains only one IgG domain whereas the Type II IL\u20101 receptor contains three domains. In this regard, the single IgG domain of IL\u201018BP is similar to IL\u20101R8 (SIGIRR), which also has a single IgG domain. The salient property of IL\u201018BP in immune responses is in downregulating Th1 responses by binding to IL\u201018 and thus reducing the induction of IFN\u03b3. Since IL\u201018 also affects Th2 responses, IL\u201018BP also has properties controlling a Th2 cytokine response. Harboring a classic signal peptide, IL\u201018BP is readily secreted. Serum levels in healthy subjects are in the range of 2,000\u20104,000 pg/mL compared to the levels of IL\u201018 in the same sera of 80\u2010120 pg/mL.55 Moreover, IL\u201018BP binds IL\u201018 with an affinity of 400 pM, an affinity significantly higher than that of IL\u201018Ra. Because a single IL\u201018BP molecule binds a single IL\u201018 molecule, one can calculate bound vs free IL\u201018 in a mixture of both molecules.55 This balance and the concentrations of free IL\u201018 may be more relevant than total IL\u201018 when interpreting the concentrations of IL\u201018 in patients. For esample, in Wegener's granulomatosis and systemic lupus erythematosus, both IL\u201018BP and IL\u201018 are high, but the level of IL\u201018BP is not sufficiently high enough to neutralize IL\u201018 and therefore, the level of free IL\u201018 is higher than in healthy subjects. The same observation has been made in situations such as sepsis, sJIA and macrophage activation syndrome.55, 56\n",

This is due to the different barriers composing the intestinal mucosa. First, an anatomical barrier consisting in an epithelial cell and mucus layer associated with an antimicrobial barrier including antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulin A, then an immunological barrier in the lamina propria containing cells of the innate and adaptive immune system constituting the gut\u2010associated lymphoid tissue, GALT.85, 86 In this context, IL\u201018 may play a dichotomous role (Figure 3). In homeostatic conditions, IL\u201018 is protective. NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes activation in epithelial cells may induce IL\u201018 production, which in turn, induces the maturation of goblet cells, mucus and production of antimicrobial peptides which maintained both an intact intestinal barrier and normal microbiota in the lumen. In addition, IL\u201018 may also decrease Th\u201017 differentiation and modulate Treg cell function, since these cells in the lamina propria express the IL\u201018R.87 In case of chronic inflammation with anatomical barrier rupture and dysbiosis on the contrary, IL\u201018 is detrimental. NLRP3 and other inflammasomes may be activated in mononuclear cells from the lamina propria inducing large concentrations of pathogenic IL\u201018, leukocyte recruitment and severe inflammation.88, 89 In this setting, IL\u20101\u03b1 constitutively present in intestinal epithelial cells is released by injured cells and has an important pro\u2010inflammatory role, whereas IL\u20101\u03b2 secreted by mononuclear cells from the lamina propria has been shown to play a rather protective healing role.90 Anti\u2010TNF\u03b1 and anti\u2010IL\u201012/23 are efficient treatments in inflammatory bowel diseases, likely via the decrease in IFN\u03b3.91, 92 Since TNF\u03b1 can induce IL\u201018, it is possible that part of the action of anti\u2010TNF\u03b1 may in fact be due to IL\u201018 inhibition.",

This mechanism dominates over that of canonical inflammasomes, which activate caspase1, such as NLRP3.179 Excess of pyroptotic cell death may induce both strong IL\u201018 and DAMPS release inducing an \u201cecosanoid storm,\u201d shock and death.11\n",

The primary form usually occurs early in life and is due to recessive mutations affecting proteins involved in lymphocyte cytotoxicity, such as perforin, Munc 13D, syntaxin 11, Munc 18\u20102, rab27 or Lyst.182 The other HLH syndrome, is also known as Secondary HLH or Macrophage Activation Syndrome, complicates infections, notably due to intracellular micro\u2010organisms, lymphoma or rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and its adult equivalent, adult\u2010onset Still's disease (AOSD).183Animal models can mimick the two forms of HLH. Perforin\u2010deficient mice infected with lymphocyte choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was the first published model of primary HLH, followed by models using Munc 13D\u2010or Rab27\u2010deficient mice, or murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection.184, 185, 186 Another model mimicking secondary HLH is due to TLR\u20109 hyperstimulation by repeated CpG injections into wildtype mice.187 More recently, other models of secondary HLH have been reported, such as LPS stimulation in mice overexpressing IL\u20106, EBV, Salmonella typhimurium or murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in humanized or wildtype mice.188, 189 In humans as well as in all these animal models, excess circulating inflammatory cytokines with a rather Th1 profile, designed as a \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d is the primary event.184, 187, 190 Among them, IFN\u03b3 seems to play the important pathogenic role, since inhibition of IFN\u03b3 appears protective in most murine models.184, 187, 191 It is not completely clear, however, since some models depend also on TNF\u03b1 or other cytokines.189, 192, 193\n",

Several reports have found elevated IL\u201018 concentrations in the serum of patients with both primary and secondary HLH as well as in animal models and IL\u201018 correlated with the biological criteria and evolution of the disease.56, 184, 187, 191, 194, 195 Usually, the concentrations of IL\u201018 range from 0.6 to 3 ng/mL in HLH patients. There is the exception in two conditions, in which IL\u201018 concentrations are higher than 5 ng/mL, namely XLP type 2 due to XIAP mutations and sJIA/AOSD.195, 196 In both situations, IL\u201018 concentrations do not return to normal levels even after recovery of the HLH. Such elevated concentrations are unusual for an inflammatory cytokine and question its significance, especially since in the majority of these studies, the distinction between total IL\u201018 and free IL\u201018 was not made. In a previous study of Secondary HLH complicating lymphoma, infections and AOSD, we observed an increase in free IL\u201018, IL\u201018BP concentrations being similar to those in control patients without HLH, perhaps suggesting a relative resistance of IL\u201018BP synthesis to IFN\u03b3 which was elevated in these patients.56 A resistance of mononuclear cells to produce IL\u201018BP in response to IFN\u03b3 stimulation, was indeed reported in a patient with a primary HLH.197 This relative imbalance between IL\u201018 and its natural inhibitor may favor IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 excessive production. Thus, there was a study on the effect of recombinant human IL\u201018BP in a model of perforin\u2010deficient mice infected with MCMV. Although there was no reduction in survival, IL\u201018BP demonstrated a significant protective effect on liver and spleen lesions due to the decrease in IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and FasL concentrations.198 Noteworthy is the fact that in this animal model, no anti\u2010cytokine strategy has been shown to increase survival probably due to the fact that concentrations of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 are found, respectively, 10\u2010fold and 5\u2010fold higher than in the LCMV\u2010infected perforin\u2010deficient model.184, 186, 199 However even in the perforin KO\u2010LCMV model, anti\u2010IL\u201018 treatment did not significantly influence animal survival.184\n",
