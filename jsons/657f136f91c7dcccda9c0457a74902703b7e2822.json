First, we reveal that IP2 n can be computed by a depth-two threshold circuit of size significantly smaller than a folklore construction of size O(2 n ). Namely, we give a construction of such a circuit (denoted by THR \u2022 THR circuit) of size O(1.682 n ). We also give an upper bound of O(1.899 n ) for the case that the weights of the top threshold gate are polynomially bounded (denoted by MAJ \u2022 THR circuit). Second, we give new lower bounds on the size of depthtwo circuits of some special form; the top gate is an unbounded weight threshold gate and the bottom gates are symmetric gates (denoted by THR \u2022 SYM circuit). We show that any such circuit computing IP2 n has size \u03a9((1.5 \u2212 ) n ) for every constant > 0. This improves the previous bound of \u03a9( \u221a 2 n /n) based on the sign-rank method due to Forster et al. [JCSS '02, FSTTCS '01]. Our technique has a unique feature that the lower bound is obtained by giving an explicit feasible solution to (the dual of) a certain linear programming problem. In fact, the problem itself was presented by the author over a decade ago [MFCS '05], and finding a good solution is an actual contribution of this work.",

Currently, we cannot refute that every function in the class NEXP (non-deterministic exponential time) can be computed by a polynomial-size depth-two circuit consisting of threshold gates with unbounded weights (denoted by THR \u2022 THR circuit). There is a long line of research aiming for understanding the computational power and the limitation of depth-two threshold circuits (e.g, [5, 9, 10, 13, 14] or see an excellent book [12, Chapter 11.10] ).

For every k \u2265 1,Hence, s(IP2 n ) = \u03a9((1.5 \u2212 ) n ) for every > 0.Although we only prove the lower bound, we strongly believe that our bound on z \u221e is tight, i.e., z \u221e = 1.5. Note that s(IP2 n ) \u2264 2 n by the construction described in Introduction and the fact that AND is contained in SYM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best known upper bound on s(IP2 n ) 1 .Proof of Theorem 10. The proof is done by giving a feasible solution to the dual of the LP problem (3), and then estimating the value of the objective function.We define Z k to beThe dual of (3) is given byThe LP duality theorem guarantees that the maximum value of the objective function in this dual program (6) equals to z k . Since LP (6) is a maximization problem, any feasible solution gives a lower bound on z k .Here we present a feasible solution to LP (6) that will be analyzed in the proof. Defineas follows:4k 2 if both of u and v are odd and t u,v = 0 otherwise. Note that we inspired this solution through actually solving LP (6) using an LP solver.In order to show the feasibility of s \u2022 t, it is enough to verify that the first constraint in LP (6) is satisfied. For x \u2208 {0, 1} 2k , letThis can easily be verified by observing that the LHS of this equation is equal to, completing the proof of the feasibility of s \u2022 t. We proceed to the estimation of the value of the objective function. The proof is by the induction on k. For k \u2264 10, we can verify the theorem by a direct calculation (see Table 2 ). Suppose that k \u2265 11. By the definition of s \u2022 t and the inductive assumption, we haveBy an elementary but somewhat lengthy calculation, we can show that z k \u2265 1.5 k 1 \u2212 1 \u221a k k as desired. The detailed calculations are omitted due to the page restriction and will appear in the full version of the paper.",
