In the aftermath of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic and the continuing threats of avian A(H5N1) infections and other emergent respiratory virus infections such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the purpose of the meeting was to address the many gaps in our understanding of pathogenesis and clinical management of severe influenza and other respiratory virus infections. The meeting was comprised of both invited state-of-the-art lectures, a number of which are the subject of detailed summaries in this supplement, and of oral and poster abstract presentations of new data. The following summary highlights some of the key points made during the meeting. Readers are referred to the nine review articles in the supplement for more comprehensive coverage of particular topics.",

Increased surveillance in various countries in South-East/East Asia continues to provide more information on factors affecting the epidemiology, demographics and seasonality of influenza and other respiratory infections, as well as the role the region plays in the global dynamics of influenza evolution and epidemiology.

In response to human cases of avian A(H5N1) influenza and the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic, a series of 'emergency' and 'interim' guidelines were published. More recently, these are being consolidated, incorporating extensive review of existing literature, to produce a comprehensive WHO standard guideline on clinical management of severe influenza disease, in preparation for future emergencies. The broad scope encompasses as follows: treatment for severe influenza, for example viral pneumonia, ARDS, multiple organ failure, septic shock; pharmacological interventions for treatment, including antiinfluenza drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs and adjunctive therapies; non-pharmacological clinical interventions, such as mechanical ventilation, oxygen and fluid management; and prevention of severe influenza in patients at higher risk of progression to severe disease. To facilitate the collection of the knowledge needed to address key questions associated with the prevention and treatment for the full spectrum of respiratory viral infections, the WHO is also spearheading a public health research agenda for influenza called the Battle Against Respiratory Viruses (BRaVe) initiative. 1 The associ-Introduction \u00aa 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd",

            "text": "From observational data, the mortality attributed to seasonal and pandemic influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome in children <5 years of age is usually significantly lower than in older patients. 2, 3 In contrast to seasonal influenza, the 2009 pandemic was associated with lower mortality in the elderly, in part explained by higher prevalence of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies in older individuals. 4 However, low-avidity serum antibodies directed against influenza may predispose patients to risk of more severe diseases; for example, a higher incidence of low-avidity pulmonary immune complexes with C4d deposition was observed in patients with severe influenza. 5 Presence of preexisting cell-mediated immunity has also been associated with blunted severity of illness. 6 As with seasonal influenza, pregnant women had a higher rate of hospitalization and death resulting from infection with the 2009 pandemic A (H1N1) virus. 3 However, in contrast to other countries, no maternal mortality among pregnant Japanese women was attributed to the 2009 pandemic, in part because of the aggressive use of antiviral agents for prophylaxis and treatment. 7 Obesity has also recently been recognized to be a risk factor for severe influenza, including increased risk of complications and mortality. 3, 8, 9 Two studies reported a shift to older age groups in the severity of influenza due to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in post-pandemic seasons. One study of patients in Beijing in 2011-2012 also observed that community-acquired pneumonia was more serious in patients infected with A(H1N1) pdm09 than in patients with seasonal A(H3N2) infection. The other study in England concluded that the increased impact of A(H1N1)pdm09 on critical care in 2010-2011 reflected increased transmission associated with lower temperatures and secondary bacterial infection. The innate immune system plays a key role in early influenza infection, and cytokine/immune dysregulation is important in disease pathogenesis. In influenza-infected patients, there appears to be differential expression of TLRs on monocytes and dendritic cells, with higher expression of TLR 3, 7, 8 and 9 on dendritic cells and of TLR 8 and 9 on monocytes, and lower levels of TLR 2 and 4 on monocytes. Furthermore, there is a negative correlation between expression of TLR 3, 8 and 9 on monocytes and dendritic cells and virus load. In contradistinction, higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin(IL)6, IL8, IL10 and MCP-1, are associated with higher virus loads, worse clinical symptoms, longer length of hospitalization and higher risk of ICU admission for both seasonal and pandemic influenza. [10] [11] [12] An extensive study of the causes of severe influenza during the 2009 pandemic, including patients enrolled by the 'Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium' (MOSAIC) in the UK, identified a minor variant (SNP rs12252-C) of the gene encoding the innate restriction factor, interferon-inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM3), that appears to be more prevalent among patients requiring hospital admission secondary to increased virus replication and/or alteration of influenza-induced cytokine expression. 13 A hyperactivated proinflammatory, but suppressed adaptive immunity (Th1/ Th17)-related, cytokine response pattern was found in patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 pneumonia, different to that seen in patients with seasonal influenza. 11 A study of 49 previously healthy adults admitted to the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases, Vietnam with RT-PCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 infection showed that the severe symptoms which developed in 10 of the patients were associated with transient T and NK cell deficiency. 14 CD8 phenotype changes during mild influenza in the 39 other patients were consistent with a rapidly resolving memory response, whereas in severe influenza, activation was either delayed or excessive, and recruitment of effectors cells to the lung appeared to be impaired.",

For example, the influenza viral polymerase complex (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, virus RNA) has been shown to associate with a network of more than 300 human host proteins. Functional genomics (RNAi) approaches allow the study of how these host factors regulate virus RNA synthesis, induction of innate immune responses and adaptation to human cells. A number of the cellular proteins with different activities were shown to modulate polymerase activity and some RNA-binding proteins, including the DEAD-box RNA helicase 17 (DDX17), also governed A(H5N1) polymerase activity and efficient infection of human or chicken cells according to the species-specificity determinant residue 627 of PB2. 19 Thus, this network of virus polymerase-host protein interactions in part controls adaptation, replication and pathogenicity of A(H5N1) viruses in humans.

Rapid antigen-based and in particular nucleic acid-based tests are largely replacing culture-based methods. qPCR or chip-based microarrays are particularly adept at multiplex screening for a wide variety of organisms, but may be limited by mutations emerging through evolution or emergence of novel variants. At one end of the spectrum of complexity, the PathChip system, which can amplify 'all' viruses and bacteria, whatever their genetic diversity, and automatically detect the presence of any of 50 000 virus and 20 000 bacteria genomes in a single test of a clinical sample, was described. In one trial of more than 250 samples, comparing its performance with other multiplex respiratory diagnosis platforms and cell culture, the chip achieved an average specificity of 98% and average sensitivity of 83% for 11 groups of viruses, with an average negative predictive value of 98%. Such wide ranging tests also have applications in molecular epidemiology and virus discovery. At the other end of the spectrum, there is the need for simple, cost-effective and highly sensitive methods for rapid detection of human A(H5N1) infection. An 'RT-SmartAmp' assay has been developed that combines both reverse transcriptase (RT) and isothermal DNA amplification reactions in a single step, thereby avoiding RNA extraction and PCR reaction. 21 It provides a practical tool, which is highly sensitive for A(H5N1) (lower limit of detection of~50 copies of virus RNA) with no cross-reaction with seasonal A (H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) or B-type viruses. Incorporation of an excitation-controlled hybridization sensitive fluorescent primer with a high signal-to-noise ratio facilitates on-site visual end-point detection.",

The frequency of resistance in oseltamivir-treated patients has been determined in a prospective, multicentre study called IRIS and coordinated by Roche since 2008. 24 Analysis of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from patients undergoing oseltamivir treatment revealed that approximately 13% of paediatric patients aged <5 years shed oseltamivir-resistant virus with the H275Y NA mutation. The frequency of resistance was significantly lower in older age groups (approximately 1%). Furthermore, the frequency of cases shedding resistant virus was higher in 2011 than in the previous 2 years, despite a similar numbers of patients being enrolled over the 3-year period. Viral shedding was more prolonged in oseltamivir-treated patients shedding the H275Y variant than in those infected with an oseltamivir-sensitive virus, demonstrating the reduced effectiveness of oseltamivir against the variant strain. Infection with a H275Y variant was detected in two Dutch travellers returning from vacation in Spain, both of whom had not been treated with oseltamivir. 25 These oseltamivir-resistant strains also contained the three potentially 'permissive' NA mutations, V241I, N369K and N386S, suggested to facilitate the spread of resistant virus in a community cluster in Australia in 2011. New insights into the mechanism of oseltamivir resistance conferred by a I223R substitution in NA of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were provided by crystallographic analysis of the NA, which demonstrated that the I223R substitution causes a narrowing of a region of the enzymatic site which results in a greater reduction in oseltamivir than zanamivir binding. 26 In immune-compromised mice continually infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, oseltamivir treatment selected for variants with a H275Y NA mutation, while laninamivir treatment selected for variants with E119G and R152K NA mutations.

Phase I safety studies and proof of concept studies utilizing a human challenge model are currently planned with the hopes of starting Phase II studies in high risk (e.g. transplant recipients and nursing home residents) and severely ill, hospitalized adults in 2017-2018.",

The ability to decrease A(H5N1) virus replication by modulating the expression of host proteins that are involved in cellular pathways such as endocytosis has been investigated. 38 Downregulation of proteins of the coat protein complex, by siRNA against COPA or by Brefeldin A, achieved a modest reduction in A(H5N1) infection in human cells without any associated cytotoxicity and demonstrated the potential for influenza replication to be reduced by inhibition of these host proteins. In a separate study, using cDNA microarray and long non-coding RNA microarray analyses, two genes in A549 cells were shown to be differentially expressed following influenza infection and to be associated with transport of NA in infected cells, providing possible future antiviral targets.",

A study conducted in the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam and three other hospitals in Viet Nam with experience of epidemics, by in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, involved people representing different constituents of the health system (from research staff to patients) and who have participated in or reviewed research projects on infectious diseases. Seven main themes emerged, concerning: (i) the dividing line between public health needs, medical practice and research; (ii) the vulnerability of research participants and family members; (iii) research information provision and factors influencing decisions of research participants/family members; (iv) challenges faced by IRBs and factors which might influence their review and oversight in the setting; (v) dynamics of research collaboration; (vi) multiple commitments of investigators and staff due to existing and emergency workloads; and (vii) the role of the media and wider society during such rapidly evolving epidemics. While some of the issues are of general concern, others are unique to rapidly evolving epidemics, and it was stressed that these considerations be addressed effectively before the next major epidemic or pandemic.",
