Originating from the French verb \u201ctrier\u201d meaning \u201cto sort,\u201d it was first used in the fifteenth century marketplaces in England and France to refer to grouping goods by quality and price.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Implicit in this early application of the term is the second component of triage, which is to assign some ranked value or priority to what is being sorted (Fig. 1\n). This prioritization aspect of triage is what is practiced on a routine basis in the ER and elsewhere but distinctly different from the full extent of triage used in a disaster.6 In disasters, in addition to sorting and prioritizing patients, triage also includes allocating scarce resources in order to \u201cdo the greatest good for the greatest number\u201d (Box 1\n).1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Although this phrase easily slips off the tongue, many overlook its profound implications implicit in shifting decision making from a focus on individual patient outcomes to population-level outcomes.4, 5, 7 Although many clinicians have day-to-day experience with prioritizing patients for the benefit of that individual patient, very few clinicians have experience with population-level decision making during periods of resource scarcity.1, 6\nBox 1Components of disaster triage\nSortingPrioritizingAllocating resources\n",

When evaluating a potential benefit of a treatment to a patient, one is attempting to determine the incremental benefit7, 15, 16 of that treatment compared with receiving a less resource-intensive or delayed treatment, but rarely does this ever mean no treatment. For example, it cannot be simply assumed that if a patient does not receive admission to intensive care and the provision of life support that they will certainly die.17 Furthermore, what is being considered is not a binary outcome between death and survival but rather the probability of death across an entire range of treatment options.7 Finally, it is important to remember that for both patients and society, survival in of itself is not the only outcome of concern; equally important is the quality of life for those who survive. Thus, the key factors being considered when making disaster triage decisions need to include survival, quality of life, and the resources necessary to achieve these outcomes (Box 2\n).18\nBox 2Disaster triage outcome considerations\nSurvivalQuality of lifeResource consumption\nData from Christian MD, Fowler R, Muller MP, et al.

The decision to implement \u201cdisaster triage\u201d involves the additional component of resource allocation implicit in the meaning of the term \u201cdisaster.\u201d A disaster can be defined as an event that results in injuries or loss of life and results in a demand for services that exceeds available resources.19 However, in terms of the health care response to an event, this binary concept of either being in a disaster or not is less helpful and likely impairs the response; thus, it is much more useful and common to consider the concepts of surge management.20, 21, 22, 23 Applying these principles, the clinician scales response strategies (conventional, contingency, or crisis) to the magnitude of the surge based on the balance between resource demand and supply, which is context dependent and will vary from incident to incident. In situations of minor or moderate surge whereby conventional and contingency strategies are used, the standard of care for patients remains relatively comparable to normal,24 and thus, only routine triage (sorting and prioritizing) should occur (Fig. 2\n). It is only during a major surge, when resources are, or will be, overwhelmed do crisis standards of care25 and response strategies involving the allocation (rationing) of resources come into play, necessitating \u201cdisaster triage.\u201d16\n",

Once a decision is made to implement disaster triage, many of these patients will have their access to these resources restricted with potential consequences for them.2 In addition, this transition is very difficult for clinicians who likely have never faced such situations in their careers.1, 26 Patients who are not triaged to immediate treatment should be reevaluated regularly and retriaged if their condition changes or the resource situation improves. All patients should receive some form of treatment, at a minimum, palliative care.1, 2, 27\n",

In most situations, secondary triage is conducted by a single senior physician or surgeon or group of senior physicians or surgeons drawn from a variety of backgrounds, including emergency medicine, intensive care, or trauma surgery.28, 45, 46, 47 Toida and colleagues44 developed the Pediatric Physiological and Anatomical Triage Score specifically for pediatric secondary triage for trauma and CBRNE (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive) -related disasters.

In a conventional or contingency situation, when there is not an absolute shortfall of resources, the inclusion criteria for admission to ICU in most units will be patients who are at high risk of deteriorating and requiring initiation of life support or who are already receiving life support. When a shift is made to a crisis response, the inclusion criteria threshold changes to those who have already declared themselves to absolutely require life support. Similarly, exclusion criteria, which exist even during conventional and contingency situations,15, 62, 63 shift during a crisis such that patients with either baseline conditions or severity of illness/injury that places them in the realm of futility for immediate to short-term survival may be excluded. The use of the SOFA score in these protocols is not without controversy.64, 65, 66, 67 However, the latest iterations of an ICU triage protocol57 developed by the Influenza Pandemic ICU Triage Study Investigators of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society clinical trials group improve on prior attempts and show significant promise.",

Previously, it was thought that in well-developed Emergency Medical Systems paramedics alone could undertake primary triage, and there was a limited role for physicians in this setting.2 However, more recent experience28, 74 and data show the benefit of properly trained and equipped prehospital physicians in primary triage, in particular when there are delays in evacuating patients from the scene to hospital.46 When an experienced physician/surgeon is not available to triage, then the next most clinically trained and experienced providers should undertake triage.Box 3Essential triage officer skills\nExtensive clinical experienceStrong leadershipEffective communicationAgile decision making\n",

First, there is some evidence that their knowledge and understanding of triage may be better,6 but that seems to be a minor component. Likely the critical factor is their clinical experience impacting their ability to rapidly identify \u201csick from well,\u201d combined with their ability to understand patients\u2019 overall clinical course and treatment needs (the \u201cbig picture\u201d).1 Providers such as paramedics rarely are afforded the opportunity to have longer-term follow-up on their patients or to see how they progress over the course of their acute illness/injury or respond to definitive treatments. Just as it is important for the surgeon or intensivist doing tertiary triage to understand what will happen in the operating room (OR)/ICU, so too will triage be most effective if primary triage decisions are informed by an understanding of what resources the patient requires on arrival to hospital and the systems in place to provide them. Finally, senior physicians, in particular, intensivists and emergency medicine physicians who manage multiple patients in large ICUs or EDs on a daily basis, are well accustomed and experienced in making complex, critical decisions with limited information.76, 77, 78, 79 This type of experience makes them uniquely well suited for both triage and leadership in major incidents.",

The crux of the issue is whether triage decisions, at the coal face in the midst of a mass casualty situation, should be made by an individual or a committee. Most recommendations suggest an individual triage officer1, 2, 16, 28, 29, 45, 46, 47, 51, 53, 70, 71, 72, 73 rather than a committee.54, 60 However, even in those studies that do recommend a single person ultimately makes the triage decision, most recommend that a multidisciplinary team work in conjunction with and support the triage officer through obtaining information, undertaking assessments, and so forth. Following good leadership principles, the triage officer should take input from his/her team members; thus, having a single final decision maker does not mean decisions are made in isolation. Multiple triage officers (and supporting teams) may be required to manage casualty volumes. Although some advocate committee-based triage decisions, it is unlikely that primary, secondary, or tertiary triage decisions could ever be effectively implemented on scale with the required time dependencies for such decisions, including decisions regarding critical care in a mass casualty incident. Reverse triage decisions, including the withdrawal of life support, may be more amenable to a committee-type decision given the lack of time pressures for these decisions.",

Many clinicians can find this conceptual transition difficult to make. Further complicating matters is that ethical perspectives vary at the societal level around the world on many topics, including their views on the role of clinicians in decision making and use of \u201clotteries\u201d rather than triage for the allocation of scarce resources.26, 60, 69, 89\n",

Thus, they include a population that does not meet the inclusion criteria for which the Ontario Triage Protocol was designed. In addition, the focus of Morton\u2019s research question is to \u201cpredict the need for mechanical ventilation and critical care admission.\u201d As discussed earlier, this is posed as an erroneous question of tertiary triage in a mass casualty situation and would actually guide who to prioritize for hospital admission (secondary triage). Rather, tertiary triage occurs among those who have already declared themselves to require life support and aims to predict who will benefit from it most and lead to the overall highest survival in the population. The work by Adeniji and Cusack95 provides another example of these same errors being made.95 The first step to conducting high-quality research in triage is to understand the underlying principles of triage.",
