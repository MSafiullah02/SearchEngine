FCoV spike (S) gene mutations are considered to contribute to the change in virulence by enabling FCoV infection of and replication in macrophages. This study investigated the presence of FCoV with and without S gene mutations in cats with FIP using two different real-time RT-PCRs on different samples obtained under clinical conditions. Methods Fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) and incisional biopsies (IBs) of popliteal and mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, omentum and kidneys (each n = 20), EDTA blood (n = 13), buffy coat smears (n = 13), serum (n = 11), effusion (n = 14), cerebrospinal fluid (n = 16), aqueous humour (n = 20) and peritoneal lavage (n = 6) were obtained from 20 cats with FIP diagnosed by immunohistochemistry. Samples were examined by RT-PCR targeting the FCoV 7b gene, detecting all FCoV, and S gene mutation RT-PCR targeting mutations in nucleotides 23531 and 23537. The prevalence of FCoV detected in each sample type was calculated. Results In 20/20 cats, FCoV with S gene mutations was present in at least one sample, but there was variation in which sample was positive. FCoV with mutations in the S gene were most frequently found in effusion (64%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 39-89), followed by spleen, omentum and kidney IBs (50%, 95% CI 28-72), mesenteric lymph node IBs and FNAs (45%, 95% CI 23-67), and FNAs of spleen and liver and liver IBs (40%, 95% CI 19-62).",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is one of the most important infectious diseases in cats, but its pathophysiology is still not fully understood. According to the internal mutation theory, FIP emerges when feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) mutate within their host to a highly virulent biotype 1,2 and the host's immune system is not able to control the infection. 3, 4 The exact nature of mutations that are responsible for the development of FIP is not known yet. A combination of different mutations on different genes is likely as mutations that have been identified to date do not qualify as sole causes for FIP. [5] [6] [7] [8] This results in FCoV strains with different genome sequences in each cat with FIP, 6, 9, 10 highlighting that there are multiple pseudo-strains of FCoV within an individual cat and that a single consistent mutation responsible for all cases of FIP does not exist. Following mutation, increased virulence of FCoV is the result of a change in viral cell tropism from enterocytes to macrophages and efficient replication within these cells. 11, 12 As the FCoV spike (S) protein plays a key role in viral cell entry, 13 studies have investigated the mutations in the S gene as possible contributing reasons for the change in virulence. [14] [15] [16] One study identified mutations in close proximity in the S gene's nucleotides 23531 and 23537, causing two different amino acid substitutions in the S protein. 5 In contrast to other S gene mutations, 14 mutations in nucleotide 23531 and 23537 were identified in 96% of FCoVs isolated from cats with FIP in that study. These mutations were not identified in faecal samples of clinically healthy control cats in that study; however, no organ samples from these control cats were analysed. 5 Immunological staining of viral antigen within tissue lesions is considered the reference standard for diagnosing FIP, [17] [18] [19] but it requires invasive sampling. Molecular methods, such as real-time RT-PCR, have evolved in the past years. RT-PCR detecting FCoV is only partially useful, [20] [21] [22] as viral RNA also circulates within asymptomatic FCoV-infected cats not suffering from FIP. 20, 23, 24 Detection of the abovementioned FCoV S gene mutations 5 might help in the diagnosis of FIP as studies examining detection of these S gene mutations via RT-PCR and/or pyrosequencing confirmed that these mutations are present in the majority of cats with FIP. [25] [26] [27] However, the same mutations were also detected in cats without FIP. 28, 29 Therefore, the presence or detection of FCoV with S gene mutations in samples does not automatically equate to the presence of FIP. Sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing FIP by detecting these mutations in specific fluids (eg, serum or effusion) and tissue samples have already been investigated, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] but only a few studies compared different sample types.",

The S gene mutation RT-PCRs allow the typing of an FCoV strain based on the presence or absence of one of two SNPs within the fusion peptide of the S gene. The paired S gene mutation RT-PCRs were previously validated analytically using synthetic DNA positive controls (IDT DNA), as well as clinically using samples collected from cats originally used to identify the two S gene mutations: (1) FCoVinfected and shedding, but otherwise healthy; and (2) affected by FIP. 32 Additional studies have evaluated RT-PCR detection of FCoV mutations in paraffin-embedded tissues and effusion from cats with confirmed FIP. 27, 33 Briefly, highly specific hydrolysis probes were used, detecting either the mutation at position 3174 (A \u2192 C/T) or 3180 (T \u2192 G) on the FCoV genome, corresponding to amino acid positions 1058 and 1060, nucleotide 23531 and 23537, and M1058L and S1060A of reference sequence FJ938051, respectively, or non-mutated sequences by using an allelic discrimination approach (IDEXX Laboratories, unpublished data).

Already, when those specific S gene mutations were detected for the first time, amino acid substitution M1058L was more common (n = 108/118) than S1060A (n = 5/118) in all examined FCoVs. 5 Later studies confirmed these findings and only detected few [25] [26] [27] or no FCoV at all with S1060A. 33 As such, M1058L is the more common S protein substitution, which is also reflected by the results of the present study.",

For example, 7b gene RT-PCR was commonly positive in intraabdominal organs (mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidneys, omentum; prevalence of all FCoV 80-95%). This is in accordance with other studies, in which omentum, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen were identified as the organs with highest viral loads. 37 In contrast, the percentage of samples positive in S gene mutation RT-PCR only ranged from 40% to 50% in intra-abdominal organs. One reason for this could be the presence of S gene mutations that remain undetected by RT-PCR because of a FCoV load below the cutoff for successful differentiation. This has already been observed in other studies using the same method. 27, 33 Another reason could be the absence of the particular S 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 38, 39 Some other mutations, such as in the 3c gene, have been discussed as playing a role in FIP pathogenesis, but a clear causal relationship to FIP still has not been identified. 6, 7, 40, 41 Most likely, a combination of different mutations leads to the FCoV virulence change and, ultimately, to the development of FIP. As such, some of the cats in the present study might have experienced other mutations in their viral genome and therefore had negative results in S gene mutation RT-PCR. Infection with serotype II FCoV could be another reason for a negative S gene mutation RT-PCR despite a high viral load, as S gene mutation RT-PCR is specific for serotype I only. Serotype II is not as common as serotype I in central European cats, 42 but studies showed that mono-infection with serotype II occurs in cats with FIP, as does a concurrent infection with both serotypes. 43, 44 Multiple mutations in the S gene of serotype II FCoV that contribute to FIP development have previously been identified. 16 Furthermore, mutations or sequence variations occurring at the primer binding site could cause negative S gene mutation RT-PCR results.",

Interestingly, although S gene mutation RT-PCR was negative despite a high virus load in one sample, FCoV with S gene mutation or mixed FCoV (both FCoVs with and without S gene mutations) were detected in at least one different tissue or fluid in all of the four cats. For example, cat 18 had a high FCoV load in multiple organ samples, but S gene mutation RT-PCR was negative in these samples. However, FCoV with mutated S gene was detected in EDTA blood. This cat had histological lesions typical for FIP and positive IHC in the majority of organs, which confirms that FIP was present. These findings emphasise that a concurrent infection with different FCoV strains (non-mutated and mutated) is obviously possible and that in terms of virus kinetics, the process of evolving FIP in a patient is not a stable state.",

            "text": "The fact that non-mutated FCoV was detected in mesenteric lymph nodes and kidneys of cats 7 and 15 also highlights fluctuating virus kinetics. It is either possible that the non-mutated FCoV detected was circulating non-mutated FCoV that had already been present in these cats before FIP evolved or that a superinfection with non-mutated FCoV had occurred which led to systemic spread of non-mutated FCoV as described previously. 24 Detection of mutated and non-mutated FCoV within one cat in the present study confirms that coexistence of varying FCoV strains is common within one animal. Those findings have to be considered when performing RT-PCR. A 'negative' result of the S gene mutation RT-PCR does not rule out that the cat has FIP. Furthermore, the present study investigated which sample types (IBs, FNAs) are appropriate for virus detection. Percentages of positive RT-PCR results were similar for FNAs and IBs in most intra-abdominal organs and identical in mesenteric lymph nodes and liver for S gene mutation RT-PCR and in spleen for 7b gene RT-PCR. This is an unexpected but important result, as obtaining an IB is highly invasive and usually cannot be performed without anaesthesia. An earlier study examined whether FNA and tissue biopsies taken with a needle core device of liver and kidneys would be equally useful for diagnosing FIP via immunostaining (IHC or immunocytochemistry) and, in contrast to the findings of the present study, reported that sensitivities of immunostaining in the minimally invasive FNA and tissue biopsies were not satisfactory (11-31%) . 45 In the present study, the percentage of positive 7b gene RT-PCR results in both FNA and IB was similar to or sometimes even higher than the percentage of positive IHC in the respective organs (Table 4 ). This demonstrates the advantage of RT-PCR detecting small amounts of virus, 31 whereas immunostaining requires more material and intact cells. Of course, histopathology and IHC, which are performed in combination, have the advantage of giving indicators to the presence of other disease processes and not just presence or absence of FCoV. But when only minimally invasive sampling is possible and cytology is non-diagnostic, RT-PCR should be preferred over immunostaining to detect FCoV. Another advantage of FNA is the possibility of targeting various locations; for example, ultrasound-guided sampling of several lesions or regions within organs. This is beneficial, as virus distribution can be inhomogeneous within an organ.",
