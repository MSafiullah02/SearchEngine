It is the unpredictable nature of this epidemic that makes people want answers to some important questions about what they can do to protect themselves. This study presents an inquiry into people's knowledge and self-reported changes in behavior in response to the epidemic. Respondents were drawn from seven major occupational groups in the large central city of Wuhan. Although most respondents knew of SARS, there was still 8.4% who did not know about it. Knowledge was lowest among farmers who had come to the city for temporary work. Most respondents took action to avoid being infected by SARS, including, most commonly, efforts to improve indoor ventilation, to disinfect the indoor environment and to increase handwashing frequency. Self-reported increases in hand-washing frequency were significant; however, among the seven occupational groups, reports of increased hand-washing were consistently greater among commercial service workers, students and farmers. While it seems that possible fears induced by the epidemic led to these changes, there are still about one-third of respondents who do not wash their hands as frequently as desired. There is also the challenge of devising strategies for maintaining the desired frequency of hand-washing among those who did change.",

Numerous scientists have been working in the affected countries to provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support as required. In almost all documented cases, SARS is spread through close face-to-face contact with infected droplets when a patient sneezes or coughs. Some of the epidemic's origins remain unclear. For SARS, three activities-case detection, patient isolation and contact tracing-can reduce the number of people exposed to each infectious case and eventually break the chain of transmission. In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective way to control a new disease such as SARS is to break the chain of transmission from infected to healthy persons (Buckley, 2003; Donnelly et al., 2003; Eaton, 2003; Kontoyiannis et al., 2003; Mackay, 2003; Mandavilli, 2003) . Unfortunately, these activities brought panic to ordinary citizens and did not show there is any gender difference, especially during the early days when the Chinese government decided that SARS was a real public health problem. The panic, in part, arose because people did not know how to protect themselves. A full 2 weeks into major informational and control measures, many people still did not have complete knowledge about the epidemic. This study documented that even without thorough knowledge following health promotion and information efforts, most persons changed their health behaviors to avoid SARS infection. The example of farmers, who had low knowledge and yet still reported behavior change, is illustrative of people's desire to protect themselves.",

These changes are probably based on the immediate fear of SARS and more time is needed to observe whether they will be sustained. The results presented here can be applied to planning communication about future emerging infectious diseases. Follow-up is needed to determine how best to reinforce the maintenance of these new behaviors.",
