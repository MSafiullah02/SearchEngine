The 14 counties surrounding the San Francisco Bay Area comprised the geographic area accessible to the project staff, and a stratified random sample of 16 facilities was selected from the 88 hospitals in the identified catchment area. The target goal of 16 facilities was based on available project staffing resources. Facilities were recruited by a project staff, who contacted the director of nursing or equivalent by telephone, explained the content and goals of the evaluation, and invited participation of the facility. Replacements for facilities declining to participate were selected randomly from the same stratum as the declining facility.",

In-person training was the most frequently cited type of training offered (77.1%), and the majority of managers (79.2%) reported having offered training specific to pH1N1. Less than half of managers responded that their facility had a formal mechanism or method for evaluation of their respirator program and, of these, only 57.1% obtained input from employees as part of evaluation (as required by the OSHA respiratory protection standard). For health care workers in close contact with a patient with suspected or confirmed pH1N1 infection, 85.4% of hospital managers reported that an N95 respirator was the minimum level of protection required.",

Transmission of pH1N1 was documented among health care workers who treated the initial cases identified in California and associated with inadequate use of personal protective equipment.14 Once the novel pathogen was recognized, hospitals were expected to quickly implement their pandemic influenza plans for comprehensive infection control measures, including the early identification of suspected cases and use of respiratory protection by exposed workers. This onsite evaluation assessed respiratory protection programs and practices in a randomly selected set of hospitals several months after pH1N1 had spread throughout California, public health guidance on infection control measures had been widely disseminated, and a new state OSHA standard on ATDs had become effective.",

Of the 16 hospitals, only 1 had a program that was considered to be complete, and 1 hospital failed to provide a written program. Achieving an effective level of protection from respirator use relies on having comprehensive written procedures for all of the required elements, implementing those procedures, regularly evaluating the implementation of each element (with respirator user input), and making necessary improvements. Such an effort is required under the OSHA respiratory protection standard for any workplace where respirators are used. The most frequently missing program element in the hospitals' written RPPs was program evaluation, followed by the designation of a program administrator. These results suggest that, although hospitals have made substantial progress in implementing the use of respiratory protection, it may be necessary to assign clearer responsibility for overall oversight of the program. Conducting periodic program evaluation, including observations of health care workers using respirators and soliciting input from respirator users, should be broadly implemented. Other areas for improvement of written programs include delineating required recordkeeping procedures, and specifically how fit testing and training are conducted.

Those facilities that did not experience a shortage stated that stockpiling respirators helped them maintain adequate supply levels. Most facilities formally documented their respirator supplies and use, as encouraged by Cal/OSHA; this information could be useful for their future pandemic influenza planning efforts.

First, California was in a unique position regarding pH1N1 because the first cases occurred here, and California enacted the nation's first occupational standard for aerosol transmissible diseases in August 2009 during the peak of the pandemic. Hospitals in California may have been faster to mobilize respirator use because they had been preparing to meet the new standard. Because our evaluations were conducted later in the pandemic, hospitals may have had earlier deficiencies in respirator use that we could not have documented. Another consequence of the timing of our evaluation (influenza activity in California had moved from widespread to sporadic by early 2010) was that some hospital units no longer had any patients on airborne precautions, seriously limiting the number of respirator use observations we could conduct. Therefore, our results and conclusions based on interview data assess knowledge and intended practices, rather than observed practices. Our sample of 16 facilities was small, comprising 5.2% of acute care California hospitals. Hospitals that declined participation (4 out of 20 invited) may have been less successful at implementing respirator use. Although we obtained a sample that was generally representative in terms of size, rural versus nonrural, and type of ownership, generalizing the findings to all facilities in the state should be done with caution. This small sample size precluded analysis of the data by hospital characteristics. Finally, our aim was to evaluate a sample of California hospital RPPs and health care worker respiratory protection practices during a novel pandemic, and the findings are likely not applicable to seasonal influenza or other ATDs.",

However, several deficiencies were commonly noted. To provide a comprehensive occupational infection control program, hospitals should ensure that they have a written respiratory protection program, fully implement programs and procedures, and conduct periodic program evaluation to ensure the effectiveness of respirator use for health care worker protection. Increased accessibility of information and resources tailored for hospital respirator program administrators may be helpful in this regard.",
