In Iran, Heidari et al. reported TSF in 3.8% (619 out of 16,321) of trauma admissions between 1999 and 2004 using the National Trauma Registry (NTR) data [8]; 5.8% (36 out of 619) of people with TSF admitted to a hospital had an associated SCI. In another study, the incidence of TSF in Tehran was estimated to be about 16.35 per 100,000 and less than half of these patients had a simultaneous SCI [9]. The incidence of TSCI in Iran was estimated as 9 per 100,000 persons by another study [10].",

The burden of these impacts can be managed by improving quality of care. The lack of a reliable source of information about spine trauma with or without SCI is a significant barrier in evaluation and planning of systems of prevention, control, and care [11]. Until now, there was no spine-specific trauma database or registry system in Iran. The National SCI Registry of Iran (NSCIR-IR) is a project supported by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education to collect and provide TSF and SCI data to evaluate and improve the quality of care of persons with SCI [12].",

According to Kowal et al., a data set is a common set of data elements used to collect and report data in the registry [14]. Many studies have emphasized the importance of a data set to create national databases and support information sharing on diseases, injuries, and other health-related problems [14\u201316]. One of the most important and effective tasks for the success or failure of a registry system is the selection of appropriate data items [17]. Data set development is a critical step for nonepidemiologic registries on traumatic conditions that can lead to long-term disabilities such as TSF/SCI. The objectives for a SCI registry are focused on care and outcome measurements, requiring various data inputs from different independent and distinct resources. This study focuses on the development process of the data set for the NSCIR-IR and delineates our experiences, which might be useful for future registries, specifically in developing countries with limited budgets, resources, and information technology infrastructures.",

An expert panel with three neurosurgeons, one physiatrist, one general practitioner, one nurse, one community medicine physician, one emergency physician, two epidemiologists, and one health information management specialist was formed. We followed a stepwise approach in the development of the data set. The steps included (i) review of the data sets in similar SCI registries, (ii) selection of a data set as the base framework of the NSCIR-IR data set by the expert panel, and (iii) modification of the basic framework according to data needs, registry objectives, and feasibility of data collection.",

The selections were made based on the similarity of RHSCIR to our registry in registry type (Spinal column and SCI (TSF/SCI)) inclusion criteria. Sixteen sessions of the expert panel were held between March and October 2015. We translated the RHSCIR data set dictionary into Farsi and then our expert panel independently reviewed the translation. The accessibility of the data elements of the RHSCIR was examined by experts who were aware of the clinical documentation status and the general content of medical records in hospitals of Iran. It was noted that several variables are not recorded in patients\u2019 hospital charts; therefore, patient medical records were considered as the secondary data source of the registry. Comparability of our registry data with other countries was another issue that was discussed by the expert panel. International data standards are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), therefore, the International SCI Data Sets (ISCIDS) were also reviewed. At the third step, the expert panel made changes to Iranian data set of NSCIR-IR in order to accommodate our major data elements and concerns of quality of care. For example, our data set registers different time points from injury time to the time of arrival of ambulance to the trauma scene, time of arrival to hospital, or to a referral center, and time of the surgical stabilization with or without spinal cord decompression. With this design, it will be possible to identify major time delay points in our care providing system.",

Our evidence-based approach along with interdisciplinary expert panel review helped us to develop a comprehensive, yet applicable, data set.

Others have conducted either a survey or Delphi method on an initial version of the data set [28\u201330]. Svensson-Ranallo et al. [31] performed a comprehensive review for methodologies of data set development in health care. The results of this review showed that there are different methods such as survey, systematic review, chart review, and Delphi technique. The most common methods are the use of experts and stakeholders, but the authors suggested a combined approach with literature review, chart review, expert committee, and organized data for developing the minimum data set [31]. In our study, we used the literature review and expert committee to form the data sets.",

For example, when we chose the RHSCIR data set as our framework, we found that some of the data were not accessible at all through primary data sources of the registry. For example, we found the hesitancy of our patients in providing data related to their income, work status, drinking, and some other measures as a big barrier for data collection. In other words, assessing income is very difficult in Iran especially in people who are self-employed. Most self-employed Iranians do not express their real income for cultural reasons.

For instance, height and weight of patients are not taken on arrival to the hospital. Also, some clinical assessments such as mobility or pain assessment with specialized tools (e.g., Berg Balance Scale, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs, Douleur Neuropathique 4) are not part of the routine assessments in Iran. Also, rehabilitation and assistive devices are not provided in a specialized manner to the patients in the acute phase. Instead, rehabilitation and support services are available at the level of long-term care. Although, there is connection between the acute care system and long-term care system; there is a lack of communication and information sharing between care providers working in the two levels of Iran health care system. Patients normally work as messengers, carrying information between the two levels. In contrast, Canada has a robust information technology infrastructure. There are multiple database and reporting systems at all of the health care services levels. These include the Hospital Morbidity Database and Discharge Abstract Database for ambulatory and hospital care, National Rehabilitation Reporting System for rehabilitation care, NTR for trauma care, Continuing Care Reporting System, and Home Care Reporting System for continuing and long-term care [33\u201338]. Using primary data sources is not practical in Iran due to limited human resources for registration and funds allocated according to the large scale of data that led to a time-consuming and tedious registration process. Therefore, it was predicted that using the Canadian SCI registry as the backbone of data set in NSCIR-IR is impractical.",

In relation to patient outcome, the data set includes the Glasgow Outcome Scale that is a physician-reported outcome; however, it does not include any patient-reported outcome data, specifically about patient functional independence. Other SCI registries use standard measures for patient-reported outcome such as the Short Form 12 or 36 Health Survey, the Spinal Cord Independence Measure, or the Functional Independence Measure [21, 39, 40].
