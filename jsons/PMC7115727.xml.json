At the community and regional hospitals surveyed, beds averaged 154 (SD, 66; median, 173; range, 60\u2013211) and 397 (SD, 249; median, 326; range, 174\u2013763), respectively. Physicians ranged from 50 to 900. Displacement of 5944 physicians from the disaster area (223,000 km2) hampered an already devastated health care infrastructure.
