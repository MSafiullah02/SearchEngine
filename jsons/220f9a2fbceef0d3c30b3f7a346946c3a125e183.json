            "text": "If protein structure determination is viewed in terms of a pipeline, there are generally considered to be two major bottlenecks: protein production and crystallization (or formation of a suitable sample for NMR). The first of these is particularly severe for the laboratories involved in the Structural Proteomics In Europe (SPINE) consortium, since many of the proteins targeted for structure determination by these groups are eukaryotic and the major 'workhorse' expression system is Escherichia coli. Indeed, this is reflected in the overall statistics for the SPINE project, which show some 30% of constructs yield soluble protein (Banci et al., 2006) , rising to 89% for the expression of carefully chosen bacterial proteins (Alzari et al., 2006) . Similarly, less than 30% of the total set of SPINE targets which express as soluble protein either crystallize or are suitable for NMR analysis (Banci et al., 2006) , although success rates for subsets of favourable targets rise to 60% (for example, anthrax proteins; see Au et al., 2006) . Given this attrition rate, it is clearly vital to do everything possible to optimize the sample entered into crystallization (or NMR) screening. Empirical observations suggest that there is a correlation between the biophysical properties of a protein preparation and the probability of obtaining crystals, e.g. monodispersity measured by dynamic light scattering appears to correlate well with the ability to crystallize (D' Arcy, 1994; Ferr\u00e9 -D'Amar\u00e9 & Burley, 1994 , 1997 . Hence, it is important to carry out quality assessment (QA) of purified proteins if initial crystal screening is unsuccessful or indeed in parallel with these trials. The most important biophysical properties and the most used methods for their determination are summarized in Table 1. SPINE is the largest European structural proteomics consortium, with over 20 laboratories spread over the continent and in Israel. During the 3 y course of the project, the different laboratories have developed their own protocols for protein production (Alzari et al., 2006; Aricescu et al., 2006) and QA of the produced proteins. To investigate which QA methods are used routinely, a survey was carried among the SPINE partners. In almost all purification protocols sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC) is used as a polishing step and the SEC elution profiles provide the first indication of protein purity, homogeneity and oligomeric state. In all laboratories the purity is also checked by SDS-PAGE, which yields the approximate subunit weight of the purified protein, thereby confirming the identity of the protein. In some laboratories QA ends here and the proteins are concentrated and used for crystallization trials. However, in most the proteins are subjected to other QA methods to determine additional biophysical properties. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is routinely used by most laboratories to determine the monodispersity of the protein. Mass spectrometry (MS) can be used to check the quality of the preparation, to confirm the identity of the purified protein by accurate determination of its molecular mass and to obtain information about posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation. Roughly half of the laboratories routinely use MS. Methods to determine the folding state of the sample, such as circular dichroism (CD) and NMR, are less routinely employed. This is mainly a consequence of the lower availability of the necessary equipment, although this in itself presumably reflects the relatively low information content of a technique such as CD. The same is true for methods to determine the activity or functionality which often cannot be performed because of the lack of a suitable assay. Other QA methods that were mentioned in the survey but are not (or not yet) routinely used are analytical SEC, native PAGE and static light scattering (SLS). SLS is a potentially very powerful technique as discussed in x4 below. The fluorescence-based thermal shift assay, a method to monitor protein stability, is also emerging as a QA tool of considerable value (see x3).",

Such use of MS can facilitate structure determination by X-ray diffraction or NMR (Cohen & Chait, 2001) . MS is being used for quality assurance by structural genomics/ proteomics consortia in the USA (Pantazatos et al., 2004; Jeon et al., 2005) , Japan (Yokoyama et al., 2000) and Europe Potier et al., 2003; Nettleship et al., 2005 For example, in Oxford, protein masses from around 8 to 100 kDa and selenomethionine incorporation in a sample are successfully measured automatically. A further application is the assessment of the level of methylation of lysine residues where the protein has undergone reductive methylation prior to crystallization. Each protein that comes through the Oxford pipeline is analysed by LC-ESI-MS to determine its accurate mass and selenomethionine incorporation (if appropriate). Around 78% of samples submitted for analysis give the expected accurate mass. In Strasbourg a high-throughput platform has been established consisting of ESI-MS combined with an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer. This platform is routinely used for protein and protein-complex characterization as well as for the screening of protein-ligand complexes (see x2.4).",

The presence of N-and O-linked glycans has important consequences for structural studies since they can hinder crystallization owing to their flexibility, heterogeneity and ability to obscure potential sites for crystal contacts (Butters et al., 1999) . Heterogeneity in glycosylation is caused by both variable site occupancy and variation in glycan-chain branching and composition. In Oxford, a method for the analysis of glycosylation-site occupancy has been developed, involving the removal of potential N-glycosylation sites by PNGase F, which converts the asparagine residue to aspartic acid. The sample is then subjected to tryptic digest followed by LC-ESI-MS analysis, which can detect the resulting 1 Da mass shift. Separation of glycosylated and non-glycosylated peptides may be performed using zwitterion chromatography-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ZIC-HILIC). This method is employed routinely for proteins produced via secretion in eukaryotic cell lines. Results can be used either to guide mutation of partially occupied glycosylation sites or to determine a strategy employing various enzymatic digests to modify the number of sugars attached to a protein.",

One of the major obstacles to the use of crystal-derived protein samples for MS is the use of PEG in many crystallization conditions, which swamps the spectrum obtained. The Oxford laboratories have developed a protocol for the successful removal of PEG consisting of the extensive washing of the crystal with acetonitrile followed by dissolving it in a small amount of buffer containing 8 M urea . For example, this protocol was used to determine which form of a nitrogen regulatory protein from Neisseria meningitides had crystallized (SPINE workpackage 9; see Alzari et al., 2006) . LC-ESI-MS had shown that the preparation contained both the phosphorylated and the non-phosphorylated protein. After crystallization, MS revealed that the crystals contained only the non-phosphorylated form ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, a preparation of human lymphotoxin -receptor produced via secretion from HEK293 cells was seen to contain both full-length and truncated protein prior to crystallization. LC-ESI-MS analysis, carried out on a cluster of crystals after sample preparation and PNGase F treatment to remove the glycans (Aricescu et al., 2006) , showed that only the truncated form was present in the crystals, which led to a redesign of the construct. For very small crystals, the number of protein molecules in the crystal sample (which is dependent on both crystal size and the molecular mass of the protein) may be too low for detection by ESI-MS.",

In the resulting crystal structure the last 33 residues of this domain were not visible in the electrondensity maps (Egloff et al., 2002) . However, MS analysis on dissolved crystals verified the presence of the expected 297 amino acids, thus demonstrating that the last 33 residues were present but disordered. Subsequently, the full-length NS5 proteins from two other flaviviruses (tick-borne encephalitis virus, strains V61 and V67) were expressed. After purification by immobilized metal ion-affinity chromatography (IMAC), the analysis of the protein profile by SDS-PAGE revealed that the dominant species for both proteins was the result of proteolytic cleavage, the site of which was determined by MALDI--MS to map perfectly onto the point where the dengue virus crystal structure became disordered.",

For example, the Strasbourg laboratory has developed a general two-step strategy to study interactions involving nuclear receptors and ligands (antagonists and/or agonists). Firstly, the purity, homogeneity and exact mass of the protein are determined by ESI-MS under denaturing conditions. Secondly, non-covalent complexes are detected by ESI-MS using non-denaturing conditions. The latter step allows new interaction partners to be found for selected proteins (ligand screening), the determination of the binding stoichiometry of each species involved in the formation of the complex, the monitoring of changes induced by the addition of a given ligand in the association/ dissociation pattern and the evaluation of the binding affinities of the ligands. This new approach has generated interesting results such as the detection and identification of fortuitous ligands for retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) and for the ultraspiracle protein (USP) (Potier et al., 2003) and the characterization of all-trans retinoic acid as a potential ligand for the orphan nuclear receptor ROR (Stehlin-Gaon et al., 2003) .",

Any shift in T m under different conditions is indicative of a change in protein stability. A positive shift in T m indicates a stabilization of the protein by an increase in structural order and a reduction in conformational flexibility, while a negative shift in T m indicates a destabilization. Comparison of the T m in the presence of a particular ligand with that in its absence can give an estimate of the binding affinity of that ligand. A miniaturized version using custom-designed machinery has been described (Pantoliano et al., 2001) and researchers have since adapted the technique to use commercially available real-time PCR machines, of which there are several models available (Lo et al., 2004) , and a number of SPINE laboratories have now implemented this technique (Oxford, Marseille, Stockholm). Such machines can perform simple thermal shift assays using small amounts of protein (1-15 mg per experiment). The fluorophore Sypro Orange (Molecular Probes) is commonly used. Supplied in DMSO, Sypro Orange is environmentally sensitive and fluoresces strongly when located in regions of low dielectric constant such as the hydrophobic regions exposed in unfolded proteins.",

The melting temperature of the FAD-containing catalytic domain alone (mMICAL 489 ) decreased significantly with increasing NADPH concentration.

Not all additives have a positive effect and negative shifts can be suggestive of the protein becoming destabilized. The sensitivity of commercially available real-time PCR machines means that low amounts of protein are required. A major strength of the thermal shift technique comes from comparing melting curves in one condition with those in another; for example, in different buffer conditions or in the presence or absence of ligands. Possible functions can thus be assigned to proteins where no other characterization has been performed and sequence and structural homology gives only limited clues (Carver et al., 2005; Constantine et al., 2005) . Potential crystallization and storage conditions, cofactor and other additive preferences can be swiftly assessed, allowing subsequent experiments and trials to be optimized to maximize potential success. Furthermore, drug screening based on T m values can identify positive hits and allow calculation of binding affinities which compare favourably with those obtained by calorimetry, a much more expensive, time-consuming and material-hungry technique (Lo et al., 2004; Matulis et al., 2005) . Overall the technique has proven value, which is reflected in its rapid incorporation into the battery of routine characterization tools used by several SPINE partners.",

While SLS is highly sensitive, the scattering signal is also dependent upon the amounts of each sample available. Thus, a highly dilute sample will not produce high-quality data. Additionally, the accurate determination of molecular weight from SLS data is absolutely dependent on the purity of the sample under analysis. Should the elution from a separation media contain more than a single weight species, the resultant scattering will be from the 'weight average' of the sample. If SEC is used as a final polishing step in the purification of proteins for crystallization, the samples are typically of sufficient purity for accurate weight measurement using SLS, whereas samples from an initial capture step such as IMAC will often be of insufficient purity. Finally, as is the case for all scattering techniques, the presence of large particles must be avoided as these will typically scatter so strongly that they mask the signals from the sample. These particles are often generated in small amounts by the pumps of modern chromatography systems and are not filtered out by the separation media.

These analytical tools are modelindependent and provide a profile of the differently sedimenting species found in solution. The multi-levelled assembly of large complexes can be analysed in this manner (Solovyova et al., 2004) , as well as the effects proteins have on each other's behaviour even if a stable hetero-interaction cannot be identified. Thus, nsp9 of SARS-CoV showed both monomer and dimer peaks in a g(S) analysis of velocity data (as it had shown dimeric protein by equilibrium methods, discussed above) and nsp8 displayed a complex and polydisperse profile of interaction (Sutton et al., 2004) . The combination of nsp9 and nsp8, however, produced a marked change in the sedimentation behaviour of the proteins and thus suggested an effect on each other's oligomerization state even though a stable hetero-oligomer could not be identified.",

Additionally, this concentration range also includes those used in other biophysical approaches reviewed here, such as light scattering, mass spectrometry and small-angle scattering. AUC is therefore an especially complementary technique. By the use of a combination of sedimentation-equilibrium experiments (for systems of relatively well characterized assembly state, such as monomerdimer equilibria) and sedimentation-velocity experiments (where the samples are more heterogeneous) with modelling of sedimentation coefficients from crystal structures, we have been able to make use of AUC to draw together functional and structural insights.",

Monodisperse solutions are required for ab initio or rigid-body analysis. Most notably, SAXS has practically no size limitations, allowing individual macromolecules of a few kDa and macromolecular machines of dozens of MDa to be studied. The technique is easily coupled with other structural, biophysical and biochemical methods. In particular, information on interresidue contacts from mutagenesis studies or distances from FRET is readily included to constrain rigid-body refinement of complexes (Petoukhov & Svergun, 2005) X-ray scattering patterns and the model of Btk. (a) Experimental scattering from the Btk constructs (dots with error bars), computed scattering from ab initio models (red solid lines) and scattering from the models obtained by rigid-body refinement (blue dashed lines; for the kinase domain, computed scattering from its atomic structure). For PH-SH2 and full-length protein, scattering from models is displayed as green triangles. The plot displays the logarithm of the scattering intensity as a function of momentum transfer s = 4sin()/, where is the scattering angle and is the X-ray wavelength. The scattering patterns are appropriately displaced in the logarithmic scale for better visualization. (b) Superposition of a typical ab initio low-resolution model of the fulllength Btk construct (semitransparent beads) with the Btk model obtained by rigid-body refinement of the positions of individual domains (colour-coded C chains). Typical conformations of interdomain linkers constructed by the program CREDO are displayed as blue C chains. and NMR data allows the construction of more reliable models of multi-domain and multi-subunit proteins (Mattinen et al., 2002; Grishaev et al., 2005; Petoukhov & Svergun, 2005) . In many cases, functional questions can be addressed directly, as SAXS data can be correlated with results such as kinetics, spectroscopy or interaction studies in solution under similar experimental conditions (protein concentration, temperature, buffer composition, presence of ligands). In recent years, biological SAXS has experienced a real resurgence (reviewed by Svergun & Koch, 2002 Vachette et al., 2003; .",

Btk is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase (nrPTK) essential for the development of B lymphocytes in humans and mice. Like Src and Abl PTKs, Btk contains a conserved cassette formed by SH3, SH2 and protein kinase domains, but differs by the presence of an N-terminal PH domain and the Tec homology region. SAXS data were collected independently from the full-length protein and from several deletion mutants (Fig. 4a) . The programs DAMMIN (Svergun, 1999) and GASBOR were employed to determine low-resolution shapes of these constructs ab initio from the scattering data and these ab initio models indicated a linear arrangement of domains. This arrangement was further confirmed by interactive rigid-body modelling using known high-resolution structures of individual domains and the probable conformations of missing linkers between the domains were subsequently constructed. The final model of Btk (Fig. 4b) displays an extended conformation with little or no interdomain interactions. In agreement with this model, deletion of non-catalytic domains failed to enhance the activity of Btk. These results indicate that, in contrast to Src and Abl, Btk might not require an assembled conformation for the regulation of its activity. The rigid-body model was constructed by a multi-step procedure involving interactive modelling with the program MASSHA (Konarev et al., 2001) with missing linkers added by the program CREDO (Petoukhov et al., 2002) . The recently developed global modelling programs SASREF and BUNCH (Petoukhov & Svergun, 2005) allow the construction of models automatically (also by fitting simultaneously multiple scattering curves) and gave results similar to those in Fig. 4 with little user intervention.",

In the largest DLS survey carried out so far (D'Arcy, 1994) , 44 proteins gave narrow unimodal distributions, of which 34 (77%) crystallized and 60% of the ten that gave broad unimodal distributions crystallized. In contrast, 12 proteins had multimodal (or polydisperse) distributions and only one of these crystallized (8%).

The set contained proteins from M. tuberculosis, B. anthracis, C. jejuni, N. meningitides and N. gonorrhoea. The purity of the preparations was determined by SDS-PAGE, the monodispersity by dynamic light scattering, the folding state by circular dichroism, the foldedness by NMR and the identity by MS. The threshold values were determined after the evaluation of the quality-assessment data from this survey. These were compared with the number of protein preparations that yielded crystals in crystallization trials. this survey contained SEC as the final polishing step. This was included to remove aggregates and to obtain homogeneous preparations. Next, the proteins were highly concentrated for crystallization. During this process the conformational state of a protein may change and new aggregates may form. Therefore, it is recommended to check the conformational/aggregation state of a protein by DLS, for example, before crystallization trials are set up. This was performed for approximately half of the proteins and the results were compared with the number of crystals obtained. Initially, a cutoff of 90% monodispersity was chosen, but the data showed a stronger correlation when this was changed to 85%. Most of the 94 tested proteins had a monodispersity of more than 85% and crystals were obtained for 58 of these (62%). Of the 24 proteins that were less than 85% monodisperse, only four yielded crystals (17%). This confirms earlier reports (see x7.1) that there is a strong correlation between the monodispersity of a protein preparation and the probability of obtaining crystals. In the laboratories that contributed data to this survey, methods for the determination of the folding state such as CD and NMR are not routinely used. Hence, insufficient data were available to allow for a proper correlation between the folding state of proteins and the crystallizability. Nevertheless, if a protein is not properly folded, has large unstructured regions or is even naturally unfolded, the likelihood that it will crystallize is small. Therefore, it is noteworthy that two proteins that showed more than 60% random coil in their CD spectra still yielded crystals. MS was performed on 102 of the 256 proteins to check the identity and to determine the quality of the protein preparation. Crystals were obtained with 65 of these (64%), which was only marginally better then was achieved with the proteins that were not tested (51%). This result indicates that there is no clear correlation between MS data and protein crystallizability.",

These usually consist of an IMAC step, a protease-cleavage step to remove tags and a SEC polishing step and are performed in a standard buffer system. A major drawback of this approach is that it excludes the possibility of optimizing the purification and storage conditions for each individual protein, which may lead to protein preparations of insufficient quality for crystallization. Hence, it becomes necessary to establish a protein-production and crystallization strategy in which protein-quality assessment plays an important role. The strategy shown in Fig. 5 is based on our experiences within SPINE and the results of the QA survey (Table 2 ).",

This information can then be used to design new more stable expression constructs. Experimentally, these constructs can be identified by performing limited proteolysis on the full-length protein or by exopeptidase treatment (see x2.4 and MRG, unpublished results) followed by MS analysis (see x2.4).

In the exceptional case that the purity is below this value the purification process could be adapted; for instance, by the addition of other chromatographic steps. An even stronger correlation was found with the aggregation state of the protein. To have a good chance of obtaining crystals, the monodispersity of the protein preparation should be more than 85%.

If all of these approaches fail to improve the properties of a protein preparation, what remains is to optimize the gene constructs (see above) and check the identity of a protein by MS. In the case of protein-protein or protein-ligand complexes, it is particularly important to know if all components of the complex are present in the preparation before continuing with the crystallization trials.
