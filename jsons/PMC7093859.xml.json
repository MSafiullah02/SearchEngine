They eventually became known as Universal Precautions and were designed to prevent transmission of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other blood-borne diseases.3, 4 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) based its blood-borne pathogens standard on the concept of Universal Precautions.5\n",

Therefore, infection control personnel at the Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, and the University of San Diego introduced Body Substance Isolation (BSI) guidelines in 1987. These guidelines concentrate on isolating all moist and potentially infectious body substances (blood, feces, urine, sputum, saliva, wound drainage and other body fluids) primarily by wearing gloves.6 Although these guidelines were accepted, there was some confusion regarding which body fluids or substances required HCP to use precautions under Universal Precautions and BSI. Also, it was becoming necessary to address droplet transmission and emerging multidrug\u2013resistant organisms (MDROs) such as Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci; direct or indirect contact transmission of some infectious microorganisms from dry skin or environmental sources (for example, C. difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci); and airborne transmission of infections across long distances by floating droplet nuclei. CDC expanded the concept of Universal Precautions in 1996 and began using the term \u201cStandard Precautions,\u201d which was introduced in the Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals.7\n",

Although Standard Precautions apply to all patient encounters, the application of Standard Precautions during patient care is determined by the task being performed and the type of exposure to blood, body fluid or pathogens that is anticipated. In other words, infection control procedures are determined according to the procedure, not the patient. In OSHA terminology, they are performance-based standards because they are applied to the level necessary to provide exposure protection relative to the procedure performed and the given circumstances. For example, only gloves may be needed when obtaining dental radiographs, whereas protective eyewear and clothing, gloves and masks are necessary when placing restorations.",

These findings led to increased attention to aseptic technique during the handling of parenteral medications.8, 10 The conclusions of the investigations stated that these transmissions could have been prevented if HCP had adhered to basic principles of aseptic technique for the preparation and administration of parenteral medications. Safe handling of parenteral medications, including dental local anesthetics, and fluid infusion systems is required to prevent health care\u2013associated infections among patients. These recommendations were included in the special considerations section of the Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health-Care Settings\u201420031 (Box\n). Although these safe injection practices and associated recommendations are not new, they are considered elements of Standard Precautions.BOXSummary of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Recommendations for Aseptic Technique for Parenteral Medications.**Source: Kohn and colleagues.1(pp31,32,46)\nDo not administer medication from a syringe to multiple patients, even if the needle on the syringe is changed.Use single-dose vials for parenteral medications when possible.Do not combine the leftover contents of single-use vials for later use.If multidose vials are used, cleanse the access diaphragm with 70 percent alcohol before inserting a device into the vial, use a sterile device to access a multiple-dose vial and avoid touching the access diaphragm. Both the needle and syringe used to access the multidose vial should be sterile. Do not reuse a syringe even if the needle is changed.Keep multidose vials away from the immediate patient treatment area to prevent inadvertent contamination by spray or spatter.Discard the multidose vial if sterility is compromised.Use fluid infusion and administration sets (that is, intravenous bags, tubing and connections) for one patient only and dispose of them appropriately.\n",

Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette are a combination of infection control measures designed to minimize the transmission of respiratory pathogens via droplet or airborne routes in health care settings. These measures apply not only to SARS, but also to any respiratory illness\u2014such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and whooping cough\u2014and are targeted at all patients with symptoms of respiratory infection and their accompanying family members or friends. These infection control measures begin at the point of the patient's initial encounter with a health care setting, such as the reception area in the dental office. The primary components of respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette are as follows:\ncovering the mouth and nose during coughing and sneezing;using tissues to contain respiratory secretions and promptly disposing of them;offering a surgical mask to people who are coughing to decrease contamination of the surrounding environment;performing hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions;turning the head away from others and maintaining spatial separation, ideally more than three feet, when coughing.8\n\n",
