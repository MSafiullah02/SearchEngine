Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 (Bb12), the world's most documented probiotic, has been used in infant formula, dietary supplements and fermented milk products worldwide. Furthermore, Bb12 improves bowel function and reduces the side effects of antibiotic treatment, such as antibiotic\u2010associated diarrhoea (Jungersen et al. 2014). Another benefits of Bb12 is the modulation of the immune system; however, few studies have focused on its immune function.",

In some outbreaks, this condition is responsible for high morbidity and mortality, causing great economic losses. During the course of an intestinal infection, several inflammatory molecules are released to restrain the infection, and in consequence, some damage to the epithelial tissue may occur by the infectious agent, treatment with antibiotics or the host immune response (Fasano and Shea\u2010Donohue 2005). Therefore, it is important to maintain a balance between the pro\u2010 and anti\u2010inflammatory immune responses to eliminate the infection without presenting an exacerbated pro\u2010inflammatory response (Garrett et al. 2010).",

Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which these immunological benefits are exerted is not fully understood. One mechanism is by the activation of diverse pattern recognition receptors located on the membranes of immune system cells, such as Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) family. TLR activation leads to differential cascades in signalling pathways, transcription factors expression and cytokine production to induce the appropriate immune response (Akira and Takeda 2004). Specifically, TLR2 recognizes peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid on Gram\u2010positive bacteria (Akira and Takeda 2004), such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (Zeuthen et al. 2008). Moreover, interest in the porcine immune system has been growing for its similarity with humans in terms of genetics, anatomy and physiology. Therefore, studies on the pig immune system could provide relevant information about the human immune response (Fairbairn et al. 2011; Bailey et al. 2013; Mair et al. 2014). Thus, the results of the present study can contribute not only to veterinary development, but also for potential future applications in medicine. In the present study, we demonstrate that Bb12 induces IL\u201010 production during the first hours of stimulation in both, swine monocytes and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells through bifidobacteria\u2014TLR2 interactions.",

First, we examined for IL\u201010 transcript expression at 4 h after stimulation. We found a similar increase in IL\u201010 levels correlated with Bb12 stimuli in monocytes and MLN cells (Fig. 1a). The cytokine quantification in both types of cells stimulated for 12 h also yielded significant differences compared to unstimulated cells (Fig. 1b). Notably, unstimulated MLN cells showed some basal IL\u201010 production compared to unstimulated blood monocytes; this effect could be due to the source, since MLN cells are somehow primed by stimuli, such as food or commensal bacteria, and subsequently migrate to MLN, unlike peripheral blood monocytes, which are nonprimed cells. This difference in IL\u201010 production can also be an effect of the cell composition; since blood\u2010derived monocytes are 100% antigen presenting cells (Fig. S1) while in the MLN comprise about 30% of the cell population (Fig. S2). However, regardless of the cell type, there was an increase in IL\u201010 production in both populations induced by Bifidobacterium, which could direct the anti\u2010inflammatory response. The overexpression of TLR2 in monocytes has been associated with pro\u2010inflammatory processes (Lacerte et al. 2016), and the expression level is transiently increased in the first hours upon stimulation (Johnson and Tapping 2007).",

To test the participation of TLR2 in IL\u201010 production, an anti\u2010TLR2 blocking antibody was used prior to bacterial stimulation, and the expression of IL\u201010 was quantified in blood monocytes stimulated with Bb12 for 2 and 4 h. A significant increase in IL\u201010 was observed after 4 h of stimulation, while no increase in IL\u201010 mRNA was observed with 2 h of stimulation. The IL\u201010 transcript level was significantly decreased when TLR2 was blocked (P < 0\u00b7001) (Fig. 2a).

However, contrasting results have been reported when using specific strains; for instance, bifidobacteria and some lactobacilli polarize DCs towards a regulatory phenotype, whereas other lactobacilli promote Th1\u2010inducing cytokine production in DCs (Christensen et al. 2002; Zeuthen et al. 2006). Over the past years, a substantial amount of in vitro and in vivo evidence has confirmed the potential capability of some bifidobacteria strains to modulate the immune response, specifically their ability to polarize to anti\u2010inflammatory (Imaoka et al. 2008; Mortaz et al. 2015) and regulatory (Jeon et al. 2012) responses. Citar et al. (2015) found an increase in the expression of IL\u201010 and the repression of IL\u20106 and IL\u201012\u03b2 induced by several bifidobacteria strains on the monocytic THP\u20101 human cell line in the presence or absence of LPS (Citar et al. 2015). In a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (PIE), Bifidobacterium breve MCC\u2010117 shows anti\u2010inflammatory effects against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) though induction of IL\u201010 in CD4+ C25High Treg lymphocytes (Fujie et al. 2011). In another report, pretreatment with either B. longum BB536 and B. breve M\u201016V reduce the expression of IL\u20106, IL\u20108, and MCP\u20101 induced by ETEC in PIE cells; blockade of TLR2 abolished the reduction of cytokines levels showing that TLR2 is required for the effect (Tomosada et al. 2013). Our results show that Bb12 can stimulate swine immune cells to produce IL\u201010, hence inducing an anti\u2010inflammatory response. The fact that Bb12 is capable to induce IL\u201010 expression in swine monocytes is suitable, considering that the probiotic can interact with recruited monocytes during infection and inflammation. In a recent report, rotavirus\u2010vaccinated gnotobiotic pigs co\u2010colonized with Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and B. lactis Bb12 had higher levels of ileal IL\u201010 compared to vaccinated pigs only, which may enhance intestinal specific IgA response (Kandasamy et al. 2014).",

For instance, IL\u201010 can be produced by T regulatory cells and myeloid DCs, while plasmacytoid DCs are poor IL\u201010 producers (Boonstra et al. 2006; Maynard et al. 2009). Our results indicate that in vitro stimulation of swine cells with Bb12, increase the IL\u201010 mRNA levels in monocyte\u2010derived peripheral blood cells and MLN (Fig. 1a); however, the production of the cytokine was only observed in monocytes but not in MLN (Fig. 1b). We ruled out that the increase in IL\u201010 transcript was due to an increase in TLR2, since TLR2 levels were similar in all the conditions evaluated whether stimulated or not (Fig. 1c). Contradictory results for the mRNA levels of TLRs after stimulation with bacteria have been reported. For instance, the oral administration of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 increases the expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 to activate an innate immune response in cells from the lamina propria (Castillo et al. 2011). However, only an increase of TLR9 expression but not significant changes in mRNA expression for either TLR2 or TLR4 was observed in the proximal colon of piglets fed with lyophilized Bifidobacterium Bb12 born from sows fed with Bifidobacterium Bb12 during gestation (Solano\u2010Aguilar et al. 2008). These findings suggested a selective induction of TLR9 by higher levels of Bb12 compared to piglets born from sows that did not receive Bb12 or mothers treated only with Bb12 during the last trimester of pregnancy. Similar results were obtained in weaning piglets fed daily with 107, 109\u20131011 CFU per ml of B. animalis RA\u201018 for 2 weeks. Moreover, TLR2 was increased in mononuclear cells isolated from the ileum of gnotobiotic pigs fed a combination of L. rhamnosus GG+B. animalis Bb12. In contrast, TLR9 levels were low in all tissues (Vlasova et al. 2013). Cells of the MLN and ileal Peyer's patches of suckling piglets produce cytokines after in vitro stimulation with heat\u2010killed lactic acid\u2010forming bacteria (Tohno et al. 2006) via TLR2 and TLR9. However, the results from the present study suggest that the IL\u201010 expression in swine monocytes stimulated with live bacteria of Bifidobacterium Bb12 is mediated through TLR2 since the bacterial DNA was unlikely available for recognition due to the short stimulation period (4 h) (Fig. 2a), although we did not test for TLR9 expression. Each probiotic strain shows specific immunomodulatory characteristics in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Latvala et al. 2008), suggesting that the differences in IL\u201010 activity or receptor recognition expression depends on the amount of bacteria. In addition, it is also important to consider the bacteria condition\u2014that is, whether these organisms were used live, lyophilized, UV\u2010killed or heat\u2010killed. In the present study, bacteria were used live, but unable to proliferate given the composition of the cell culture media and growth conditions, which are not favourable for Bb12 growth.",

            "text": "Furthermore, no significant changes were observed in the NF\u2010\u03baB transcript levels in any of the conditions tested (Fig. 2b). These results are consistent with the findings of a study in which THP\u20101\u2010derived macrophages were stimulated with Lactobacillus sp. or Bifidobacterium sp., and no change in NF\u2010\u03baB basal expression was observed (Mortaz et al. 2015). These results suggest that when a stimulus causes excessive inflammation, these bacteria act in a regulatory manner. NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010deficient macrophages have lower levels of IL\u201010 expression than NF\u2010\u03baB\u2010sufficient macrophages this fact is explained by several studies with cells deficient for tumour progression locus 2 (TPL2) or NF\u2010\u03baB1, which support the role of extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (ERK) in the induction of IL\u201010. TPL2 is an upstream activator of ERK; following TLR stimulation, TPL2 becomes dissociated from the TPL2\u2010NF\u2010\u03baB1 complex and activates ERK (Banerjee et al. 2006). Bifidobacterium animalis AHC7 attenuates NF\u2010\u03baB and protects against Salmonella typhimurium infection in mice (O'Mahony et al. 2010). The expression of IL\u201010 can be induced by TLR or non\u2010TLR signaling in myeloid cells. The activation of TLR results in the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB, p38 and ERK pathways. Activation of these pathways results in the induction of IL\u201010 production and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (Saraiva and O'garra 2010). The results of the present study suggest that Bifidobacterium Bb12 does not activate the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway during the first 4 h of stimulation in swine monocytes. Probiotics can alter the NF\u2010\u03baB pathway at many different levels: degradation and ubiquitination and inhibition of proteasome function (Petrof et al. 2004).",

Interestingly, in our study, Bb12 culture supernatant decreases the TLR2 transcript level (Fig. 3b). Hoarau et al. (2006), demonstrated that B. breve C50 (BbC50) supernatant induced prolonged DC survival, maturation and high IL\u201010 production through TLR2. Bifidobacterium breve BbC50 secretes extracellular components comprising a lipoprotein putatively associated with glucose moieties and acting in an aggregating form as an agonist of TLR2/TLR6 (Scuotto et al. 2014). Additionally, probiotic culture media may use TLR4 through IRAK\u20102 and via AP\u20101 to prevent IL\u20101\u03b2\u2010induced IL\u20106 induction in immature enterocytes (Meng et al. 2016). However, the involvement of TLR2 in this process remains unclear, although an immunoregulatory role for TLR2 in the recognition of probiotic strains has been described (Hoarau et al. 2006; Zeuthen et al. 2008; Kaji et al. 2010).",
