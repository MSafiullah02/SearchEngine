Consequently, immune dysfunction in elderly residents of LTCFs is primarily driven by the multiple factors that result in secondary immune dysfunction such as malnutrition, presence of multiple chronic diseases, and polypharmacy, especially with medications that diminish host defenses (eg, immunosuppressants).11, 12 In addition, LTCF residents often have cognitive deficits that may complicate resident compliance with basic sanitary practices (such as handwashing and personal hygiene) or functional impairments such as fecal and urinary incontinence, immobility, and diminished cough reflex. The elderly nursing home resident is known to have a blunted febrile response to infections.13 This parallels other age-related immunologic abnormalities. A notable fever in this population often signals a treatable infection, such as UTI or aspiration pneumonia.",

In LTC residents, the use of invasive devices (eg, central venous catheters, mechanical ventilators, enteral feeding tubes) increases the likelihood of a device-associated infection. Of the over 15,000 LTCFs in the US in 2004, 42% provided infusion therapy, 22% had residents with peripherally-inserted central lines, and 46% provided parenteral nutrition.14 Another challenge for preventing infections in LTCFs is the increasing acuity of residents, especially with the rapidly growing subpopulation of postacute residents. Postacute residents are hospitalized patients who are discharged to LTCFs to receive skilled nursing care or physical/occupational therapy. In the past, these patients, often frail, would have remained hospitalized, but, with increasing efforts to control hospital costs, these patients are now discharged to LTCFs. In addition to higher device utilization, these residents are more likely to receive antimicrobial therapy than long-stay LTCF residents.15\n",

Residents with indwelling urinary catheters in the LTCF are uniformly colonized with bacteria, largely attributable to biofilm on the catheter.27 These organisms are often more resistant to oral antibiotics than bacteria isolated from elderly persons in the community.28, 29 Catheter-related bacteriuria is dynamic, and antimicrobial treatment only leads to increased antimicrobial resistance.30 Thus, it is inappropriate to screen asymptomatic catheterized residents for bacteriuria or to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria.20 Specimens collected through the catheter present for more than a few days reflect biofilm microbiology. For residents with chronic indwelling catheters and symptomatic infection, changing the catheter immediately prior to instituting antimicrobial therapy allows collection of a bladder specimen, which is a more accurate reflection of infecting organisms.31 Catheter replacement immediately prior to therapy is also associated with more rapid defervescence and lower risk of early symptomatic relapse posttherapy.31\n",

Recommended measures include limiting use of catheters, insertion of catheters aseptically by trained personnel, use of as small diameter a catheter as possible, handwashing before and after catheter manipulation, maintenance of a closed catheter system, avoiding irrigation unless the catheter is obstructed, keeping the collecting bag below the bladder, and maintaining good hydration in residents. Urinary catheters coated with antimicrobial materials have the potential to decrease UTIs but have not been studied in the LTCF setting. For some residents with impaired voiding, intermittent catheterization is an option, and clean technique is as safe as sterile technique.33 External catheters are also a risk factor for UTIs in male residents34 but are significantly more comfortable and associated with fewer adverse effects, including symptomatic urinary infection, than an indwelling catheter.35 Local external care is required. The CDC guideline32 briefly discusses care of condom catheters and suprapubic catheters, but no guideline for leg bags is available. Leg bags allow for improved ambulation of residents but probably increase the risk of UTI because opening of the system and reflux of urine from the bag to the bladder occur more frequently than with a standard closed system. Suggestions for care of leg bags include using aseptic technique when disconnecting and reconnecting, disinfecting connections with alcohol, changing bags at regular intervals, rinsing with diluted vinegar, and drying between uses.36 A 1:3 dilution of white vinegar has been recommended for leg bag disinfection.37\n",

The specificity of the TST may be improved by an in vitro blood test of interferon release in response to TB peptides, such as the quantiferon test. The most specific diagnostic test is a sputum culture for TB, but a good specimen may be difficult to obtain. Recent advances in microbiology have facilitated the diagnosis of TB greatly.

Prevention of pressure ulcers involves developing a plan for turning, positioning, eliminating focal pressure, reducing shearing forces, and keeping skin dry.

Negative-pressure wound therapy (vacuum dressings) using gentle suction to provide optimal moist environment is increasingly being used in treatment of complex pressure ulcers.90 Nursing measures such as regular turning are essential as well.

However, these typical findings may be absent in debilitated residents, leading to large, prolonged outbreaks in LTCFs.94, 95, 96 Diagnosis in an individual with a rash requires a high index of suspicion in order to recognize the need for diagnostic skin scrapings.

A single treatment with permethrin or lindane usually is effective, but repeated treatment or treatment of all LTCF residents, personnel, and families occasionally is necessary.97, 98 Ivermectin, an oral antihelminthic agent, is an effective, safe, and inexpensive option for treatment of scabies. However, it has not been approved by the FDA for this indication. Therapy of rashes without confirming the diagnosis of scabies unnecessarily exposes residents to the toxic effects of the topical agents.

High rates of fecal incontinence, as well as gastric hypochlorhydria, make the nursing home ideal for secondary fecal-oral transmission.126 Other epidemics include scabies, hepatitis B,127 group A streptococcal infections, viral conjunctivitis, and many other infections.",

All LTCFs had policies regarding the maintenance and care of urinary catheters, although the policies were not uniform. Price et al149 surveyed 12 North Carolina LTCFs in 1985 and found that, although all 12 had a designated ICP, none of the ICPs had received special training in this area.

Focused surveillance should target infections that are preventable; that occur frequently; and that are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Facility-wide surveillance is useful for establishing an infection control \u201cpresence\u201d in the LTCF and may be required as a part of local or state regulatory programs. To establish baseline infection rates, track progress, determine trends, and detect outbreaks, site-specific rates should be calculated (eg, central line infections per 1000 central line-days). Routine analysis should try to explain the variation in site-specific rates. For example, a change in the rate might be related to a change in the resident population.

A Category-Specific System listed 7 categories of isolation or precautions based on means of disease transmission: strict isolation, contact isolation, respiratory isolation, TB isolation, enteric precautions, drainage and secretion precautions, and blood and body fluid precautions. Modifications of this approach have been promoted since 1970 with a refined Category-Specific System in the 1983 recommendations.194, 195 A Disease-Specific System listed all relevant contagious diseases and the recommended barrier method. In general, the Category-Specific System was simpler to use, but the Disease-Specific System consumed fewer resources because precautions were tailored to the specific disease. In the 1983 guideline, blood precautions were expanded to include body fluids.195 In response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the concept of Universal Precautions was introduced to protect HCWs from all bloodborne exposures.196, 197 These recommendations became adopted by OSHA and have thus been applicable to all health care settings including LTCFs.163, 198 In this system, all blood and certain body fluids are considered potentially infectious. Education, provision of needle-disposal units, provision of protective equipment (such as gloves, gowns, and protective eye wear), and monitoring compliance were part of Universal Precautions, although it alone was not considered a complete isolation system.",

ICC members often include the ICP; the medical director; and representatives from nursing, administration, and pharmacy. Participation of other departments, such as dietary, housekeeping, and physical therapy, should be considered on an ad hoc basis. Administrative structures other than an ICC may provide oversight to the infection control program. One example is an infection control oversight committee, a small group consisting of the LTCF administrator, the ICP, and the medical director. Alternatively, the performance improvement committee or patient safety committee and the ICC may be combined, but it is important to maintain the identity of the infection control program. The duties of the ICC should be delegated appropriately if no formal ICC exists.\n2Formal delegation of infection control oversight should be made in writing (Category II).3The infection control oversight committee should meet on a regular basis and have a mechanism for emergent meetings as needed (Category II).4This committee should maintain written minutes with identification of problems and plans for action (Category II).5The effectiveness of the infection control program should be evaluated by the administration on at least an annual basis (Category II).6Policies and procedures for investigating, controlling, and preventing infection transmission in the facility should be established (Category IC).\nComment: Other functions include (a) review of infection control data, (b) approval of policies and procedures, (c) monitoring program activities, and (d) recommending policy to the facility administration.\n7Consultation should be available as needed including with an infectious disease physician or other professional with expertise in infection control (Category II).\n",

Management and teaching skills also are helpful. Continuing education is essential for the ICP (eg, meetings, courses, journals).\n7The ICP should know the federal, state, and local regulations dealing with infection control in the LTCF (Category II).8The ICP should communicate with relevant facility committees and personnel within the facility, ICPs from transferring facilities, and public health authorities to ensure appropriate isolation and collection of surveillance information (Category II).9No recommendation on number of ICPs per 100 LTCF beds.\n",

The frequency of surveillance for HAIs in the LTCF should be based on factors such as acuity level of the resident population. Surveillance at least once a week generally is needed to collect timely data. Surveillance data should be collected from communication with staff; this may be during walking rounds in the LTCF. Medical progress notes in the chart, laboratory or radiology reports, nursing notes, treatment records, medication records, physical assessments, environmental observations, and follow-up information from transfers to acute care hospitals provide clues to the presence of infections.\n3The ICP should review surveillance data frequently and recommend infection control measures, as appropriate, in response to identified problems (Category IB).\nComment: Analysis of surveillance data should include at least the following elements on each infection to detect clusters and trends: resident identifier, type of infection, date of onset, location in the facility, and appropriate laboratory information.\n4Infection rates should be calculated periodically, recorded, analyzed, and reported to the administration and the infection control oversight committee (Category IB).\nComment: Infection rates usually are calculated monthly, quarterly, and annually. HAI rates are calculated preferably as infections per 1000 resident-days. A standard infection report form facilitates reporting of surveillance information. Tables, graphs, and charts may be used and facilitate education of personnel.\n5Surveillance data should be used for planning infection control efforts, detecting epidemics, directing continuing education, and identifying individual resident problems for intervention (Category IB).\nComment: In addition to collection of baseline infection rates, the ICP should perform problem-focused studies. Examples of special studies are evaluation of UTIs in catheterized residents, a study of the occurrence of influenza in vaccinated versus unvaccinated residents, or the prevalence of pressure ulcers in bed-bound residents.\n6In addition to the above outcome measures, surveillance should also include analysis of process measures relevant to infection control (Category II).\nComment: Examples include monitoring hand hygiene compliance, observation of aseptic technique, and measuring HCW influenza vaccination rates.\n",

If these requirements cannot be met, a system for transfer of cases to an appropriate institution that provides AII should be part of the overall infection control plan.\n4Housekeeping in the facility should be performed on a routine and consistent basis to provide for a safe and sanitary environment (Category IC).\nComment: Cleaning schedules should be kept for all areas in the LTCF. Cleaning products should be approved and labeled appropriately; manufacturer's (or other authoritative) recommendations for use and dilution should be followed.\n5Measures should be instituted to correct unsafe and unsanitary practices (Category II).\nComment: Environmental cleanliness may be monitored by walking rounds with a checklist for each area of the LTCF. Nursing interventions may be monitored by direct observation during such rounds.\n6Areas in the LTCF with unique infection control concerns (eg, laundry, kitchen, rehabilitation) should have the appropriate policies and procedures developed (Category II).\nComment: Laundry policies and procedures should address the following: proper bagging of linen at the site of use, transporting linen in appropriate carts, cleaning of the carts on a regular basis, separation of clean and soiled linen, washing temperatures or use of an appropriate chemical mix for low-temperature washing, covering of clean linen, protection of personnel handling soiled laundry, and hand hygiene after contact with soiled linen. Adequate supplies of clean linen should be available. Laundry regulations should be addressed if the facility does its own laundry. Dietetic service area policies and procedures should address the following: handling of uncooked foods, cooking of food, cleaning of food preparation areas, food storage, cooking and refrigeration temperatures, cleaning of ice machines, hand hygiene indications, and employee health. Food and drink should be limited to specific areas. Policies and procedures covering infection control aspects of physical therapy (including cleaning of hydrotherapy tanks) should be developed. It should include cleaning and disinfection of hydrotherapy equipment, hand hygiene indications, and cleaning of exercise equipment. If pets are allowed, the LTCF should have a policy defining access, containment, cleanliness, and vaccination of pets.\n7Policies and procedures for disposal of infectious medical waste (including waste categorization, packaging, storage, collection, transport, and disposal) should be developed in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations (Category IC).\nComment: Examples of specific issues include types of waste disposal bags, cleaning of waste transportation carts, and types of waste storage containers.

Denial of admission to the LTCF solely on the basis of colonization or infection with a resistant organism is not appropriate. HICPAC recommends intensification of containment measures for MDROs if ongoing transmission is occurring.\n7The individual resident's clinical situation should be considered when deciding whether to implement or modify the use of Contact Precautions in addition to Standard Precautions if colonized or infected with a MDRO (Category IB/IC).\nComment. Routine glove use is an example of a form of modified Contact Precautions, but it has not been validated in the LTCF setting.\n8A program of safe work practices to prevent HCW exposure should be developed in accordance with CDC/HICPAC and OSHA guidance. Used needles and syringes should not be manually recapped, broken, or bent. Self-capping needles should be used. They should be disposed of, with all sharps, in a puncture-resistant, leak-proof container (Category IC).9Gloves are indicated for contact with blood or body fluids, contaminated items, mucous membranes, or nonintact skin (Category IC).10Policies should be developed to deal with spills and personnel exposure to blood or body fluids.
