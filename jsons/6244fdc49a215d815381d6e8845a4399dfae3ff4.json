            "text": "T he bovine respiratory disease complex is a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and production losses in cattle, particularly in feedlot situations. [1] [2] [3] Bovine respiratory disease is a multi-factorial disease in which a range of adverse host and environmental factors predispose animals to infection with a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. 4 Outbreaks typically follow entry into a feedlot during which cattle are subjected to stress from transport, commingling and a rapid change in husbandry. Under these circumstances, the animals are exposed to new pathogens under conditions that are conducive to their transmission and at a time when their immune defences are reduced. Several viruses, including bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) can act as primary respiratory pathogens. 3, 5 The most frequently identified bacterial pathogens are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni, although a variety of other organisms, including Mycoplasma spp., may be involved. 4, 6 These bacteria are ubiquitous in cattle as commensal nasopharyngeal flora, but can exacerbate disease through secondary infection in the lower respiratory tract. 6 Collection of samples Samples were collected in the acute stage of disease from animals with the most severe clinical signs. Swabs were taken from inside both nostrils and placed in 3 mL phosphate-buffered gelatin saline (PBGS). Blood was collected in clot activator and lithium heparin-treated evacuated tubes. Convalescent serum samples were collected from the same animals and additional cattle from the same cohorts 2 weeks after collection of the acute samples.Lung and tracheal tissues were collected from animals with the most severe lesions identified at slaughter and were transported fresh on ice or fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. These animals were slaughtered 2 months after the onset of disease.",

The thermocycling program was preceded by incubation at 45\u00b0C for 10 min for reverse transcription for BVDV and BCoV assays. The fluorescence threshold was set manually at 0.05 and results were expressed as cycle-threshold (Ct) values, the point at which the fluorescence amplification curve crossed the threshold. A positive result was defined by a logarithmic increase in fluorescence that produced a Ct value <36. The Ct values between 36 and 40 were considered inconclusive and values >40 as negative.

            "text": "Detailed laboratory investigation of this outbreak of bovine respiratory disease identified BCoV in the absence of more common viral respiratory pathogens. Detection of BCoV in nasal swabs and pulmonary tissue supported a primary viral aetiology with exacerbation by secondary bacterial infection in some cases, which is typical of the bovine respiratory disease complex. 4, 10 Histopathology and bacteriology suggested that BCoV also contributed substantially to morbidity in this outbreak. BCoV has recently been described as a cause of bovine respiratory disease in Italy. 18 A study in the USA demonstrated that BCoV infection was involved in two high-mortality outbreaks of shipping fever in calves. 19 Two other studies have identified an association between infection with BCoV and increased incidence of respiratory disease in feedlot cattle, but decreased weight gain was identified in only one of those studies. 20, 21 Previous exposure to BPIV-3 and BRSV was common among the weaner cattle recruited to this feedlot, which is consistent with previous studies of Australian feedlot cattle indicating that these agents, as well as BVDV and BHV-1, contributed to the bovine respiratory disease complex. 3 Tests for antibodies in paired serum samples, together with sensitive molecular and culture-based pathogen detection assays, indicated that these agents were not involved in the disease outbreak described here. Exposure to BVDV occurred prior to entry to the feedlot in cohorts 1 and 2, but active transmission in cohort 3, may have contributed to the course of disease through immunosup- pression. 22 An assay to detect antibodies to BCoV was not available during this study. Such an assay could provide a sensitive herd test for BCoV infection because a study in feedlots in the USA indicated that seroconversion occurred at higher prevalence and persisted for a greater period of time compared with viral shedding. 23 Detailed analysis of production and morbidity data in combination with serology could assist in determining the effect of BCoV infection, but pathogen detection is required to discriminate between respiratory and enteric infections. 24 Real-time PCR assays have recently become a standard method in veterinary virology because of their potential to provide rapid, sensitive and specific results. 25 The assay used in this study appeared to provide superior sensitivity compared with virus isolation, which did not detect coronavirus in every qRT-PCR positive sample (unpubl. data). A similar qRT-PCR assay for BCoV detected as few as 10 copies of viral RNA in clinical specimens. 26 However, the detection of BCoV by qRT-PCR can be affected by differences in the RNA sequence in the target region of the genome. 27 The qRT-PCR assay used in the present study was designed using nucleotide sequence from a recent isolate of BCoV that caused neonatal diarrhoea in Australian calves. 13 The assay amplified a target in the ORF1b region, which is a relatively conserved portion of the coronavirus genome. 27 It is unclear if different strains of BCoV are responsible for enteric and respiratory syndromes. Antigenic and phylogenetic differences between isolates of BCoV from enteric and respiratory disease have been identified 28, 29 and the quasispecies structure of BCoV produces nucleotide sequence variation within a single isolate. 30 However, in other cases, isolates of BoCV with >98% phylogenetic similarity have been identified in enteric and respiratory disease 31 and an isolate of BCoV from a case of winter dysentery demonstrated both respiratory and enteric tropism after experimental infection. 32 Phylogenetic differences between BCoV isolates from different geographical locations are greater than the differences between isolates from different clinical syndromes. 29, 33 Further characterisation of BCoV isolates from Australian cattle is required and the potential for variation in the genome sequence needs to be considered when interpreting qRT-PCR assays.",

            "text": "Histological observations suggested that BCoV contributed to morbidity in this outbreak. Multinucleated syncytial epithelial cells have been observed previously in the lungs of cattle with viral infection. 18 In the present cases, the syncytia were confined to the bronchioles, whereas syncytia associated with BSRV may be found in both airways and alveoli. 34 Syncytial cells have been also observed in humans infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 35 Hyperplasia of BALT in the lungs of some cattle is suggestive of infection with Mycoplasma spp., 36 but these organisms were not cultured and M. bovis was not detected by qPCR in the present investigation. Interestingly, hyperplasia of BALT was observed after experimental infection of ferrets with SARS-CoV. 37 The effect of bovine respiratory disease on production can be minimised by reducing stress during adjustment to the feedlot environment. 38 Walker et al. also demonstrated that morbidity was reduced by administration of BVDV, BHV-1, BPIV-3 and Pasteurella vaccines to animals that did not have antibodies to these agents. 38 Although not currently available in Australia, evidence suggests that use of a vaccine for BCoV prior to entry into a feedlot may be beneficial. In Canada, calves with low neutralising titres for BCoV were more likely to require treatment for respiratory disease after commingling in a feedlot. 39 Furthermore, intranasal administration of an infectious, modified BoCV vaccine reduced the risk of clinical signs of respiratory disease after feedlot entry in an experimental trial in the USA. 40 Following the outbreak described here, BCoV has been further implicated as a component of the bovine respiratory disease complex in Australia during the investigation of shipping fever in cattle being exported from Australia (P Kluver and P Kirkland, unpubl. obs.) and also during diagnostic investigations of sporadic outbreaks of respiratory disease in adult cattle at Elizabeth Macarthur Agriculture Institute. BCoV should be considered in the diagnosis of respiratory disease in intensively managed cattle, but infection trials and detailed risk factor analyses are required to further elucidate the contribution of BCoV to the bovine respiratory disease complex in Australian cattle.",
