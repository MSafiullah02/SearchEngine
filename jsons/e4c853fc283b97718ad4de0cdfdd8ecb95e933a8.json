We studied the impact of recently discovered human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and new coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HKU1) on the global epidemiology of ARTI. From October 2006 to April 2007, 237 pediatric patients affected by ARTI were enrolled in our study. Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. One hundred twenty-four out of 237 samples (52.3%) were positive for one or more viruses. Picornaviruses were the most prevalent viruses (n \u00bc 61, 43.6%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (n \u00bc 34, 24.3%) and Adenovirus (n \u00bc 25, 17.9%); hMPV (n \u00bc 9, 6.4%) was the fourth most common virus detected. HBoV and HCoV showed a low prevalence (respectively 2.9% and 2.1%). RSV was the prevalent agent of LRTI (38%). Viruses were identified in more than 50% of the studied ARTI, providing useful information on clinical features and epidemiology of specific agents affecting children in cold months. Although routine surveillance of respiratory viruses does not seem cost-effective, continuous monitoring of ARTI etiology could be a useful tool for planning resources for the development of new vaccines and antiviral agents.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) are associated with significant morbidity worldwide, especially among young children. Viruses are a leading cause of ARTI, presenting a relevant epidemiological variability depending on climate and regions [Armstrong et al., 1999] . However, etiology is still undefined in a significant proportion of ARTI [Monto, 1994; Henrickson et al., 2004] . During the past few years, new respiratory viruses have been discovered [Kahn, 2007] ; human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is considered to be one of the most interesting and it has been reported worldwide [Van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Debiaggi et al., 2006; Kahn, 2006; Sarasini et al., 2006; Boivin et al., 2007] . It is associated with a large spectrum of clinical manifestations that range from mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia [Williams et al., 2004 [Williams et al., , 2006 ]. It has been reported that the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of hMPV closely resemble those of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Van den Hoogen et al., 2004] . Furthermore, other recently identified pathogens, such as human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), have been associated with respiratory tract disease [Van Der Hoek et al., 2004; Allander et al., 2005; Woo et al., 2005a,b; Kesebir et al., 2006; Pyrc et al., 2007] . The impact of hMPV, HBoV, and new coronaviruses on the global epidemiology of ARTI is still unclear. In fact, most reports have been retrospective Stockton et al., 2002] or predominantly focused on hospitalized children and children affected by lower respiratory tract infections [Maggi et al., 2003; Wilkesmann et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2006] . Moreover, human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, previously identified in childhood upper respiratory tract infections, have recently been suspected to be major etiological agents of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants [Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Jartti et al., 2004; Jacques et al., 2006] .",

Interestingly, PIC were the second most frequent viruses detected in LRTI and they accounted for 9/33 (27.3%) cases of pneumonia. Picornaviruses were also the most prevalent viruses causing URTI. Human MPV was mainly responsible for URTI, although it caused 6.1% of total pneumonia cases. HBoV was generally detected in URTI, although it was responsible for pneumonia in one patient that required hospitalization [Terrosi et al., 2007] . We sequenced the three strains of coronaviruses detected by RT-PCR in order to correlate the severity of the pathology with the specific strain. Two were typed as OC43 and one was typed as NL63. All were detected in children with a mild respiratory tract infection; none of these children developed croup or bronchiolitis. Adenoviruses mostly caused a moderate to severe pharyngitis, but they were also detected in two children with bronchiolitis and one with pneumonia, accounting for about 4% of LRTI.",

Our data appear to be in agreement with previous reports, revealing hMPV in 3.8% (9/237) of all samples. A wide variability in the hMPV circulation rate in the course of some years has been demonstrated [Maggi et al., 2003; Gerna et al., 2005] . Long sectional studies during the seasons and over the years seem to be essential to assess whether the alternation of high and low incidences could be a real epidemiological trend. Although the prevalence of hMPV was quite low in our population, hospitalization for pneumonia was required in over 20% of hMPV infections. In our study, no hMPV was detected in children older than 5 years, according to serological surveys, demonstrating that hMPV infection is acquired early in life [ Van den Hoogen et al., 2001] . Observations that claim a clinical similarity between hMPV and RSV infection have mainly been based on cohorts of hospitalized children [Foulongne et al., 2006; Wilkesmann et al., 2006] .

In our population, HBoV was detected at a rate of 1.7% (4/237 samples), lower than previously reported. However, the results are not comparable because of the different study design. In fact, none of the previous studies was prospective; moreover, one of these included only hospitalized children and showed differences in the rate of HBoV detection during a period of years [Maggi et al., 2007] . There is a growing consensus on the relationship between HBoV infections and ARTI, although high rates of co-infections with other respiratory viruses have been reported [Boivin et al., 2007] . In our population, HBoV was detected as the only virus in three out of four children and in one of these it caused wheezing pneumonia that required hospitalization, as previously described [Terrosi et al., 2007] . However, since the causal role of HBoV in LRTI still needs to be defined, a quantitative estimate of the viral load could be useful in clarifying its role in causing ARTI.",

In fact, because of the similar spectrum of clinical symptoms caused by different viruses in ARTI, ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms in outpatients to severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization, viral infections do not appear to be easily distinguishable by clinical signs alone. A wide range of prospective studies, employing control populations, may be helpful in evaluating the causal roles of these organisms and the risk factors that may correlate with more severe disease. Although routine surveillance of respiratory viruses might not seem to be cost-effective, continuous monitoring of ARTI etiology could be a useful means of planning the resources necessary for the development of new vaccines and antiviral agents.",
