As the number of cases ascended in Argentina and around the world, the epidemiologic controls were progressively intensified. On March 19th, a total of 16 d after the first case was detected in Argentina, an urgent decree was announced by the former president, establishing compulsory national quarantine until March 31st. By means of this law, free circulation of people was forbidden, only allowing certain people to travel to their workplace. Flights were cancelled, and borders were sealed.",

A more coordinated global response to the outbreak, together with a greater geographical distance and less frequency of flights from China to Argentina than from Mexico to Argentina might have had a major impact on the speed at which the virus spread. This factor definitely gave Argentinians the opportunity to design containment plans that could mitigate the spread.",
