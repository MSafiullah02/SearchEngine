Even limited to lower limb arthroplasty, heterogeneity in the likelihood of transfusion is very large: a 16-85 % and a 7.5-87 % rate of transfusion, for hip and knee surgery, respectively, have been reported (Rosencher et al. 2003 ; Gombotz et al. 2007 ). These numbers suggest that standards of care for patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery are poorly defi ned, since transfusion rate does not appear to be related to case mix, surgical technique, or anesthetic practices. Drivers for a change in blood management are different in nature but have contributed to strongly motivate international and national authorities to approve resolutions addressed to national governments and scientifi c societies. In Rec (2002) 11, the European Council recommends member states to arrange appropriate regulatory and advisory bodies both at the national and local levels in order to implement policies encompassing the use of alternatives to allogeneic blood transfusion and preventive strategies to reduce blood loss. In 2010, the World Health Assembly in \"Resolution on availability, safety and quality of blood products\" (WHA 63.12), \"Bearing in mind that patient blood management means that before surgery every reasonable measure should be taken to optimize the patient's own blood volume, to minimize the patient's blood loss and to harness and optimize the patient-specifi c physiological tolerance of anemia following WHO's guide for optimal clinical use (three pillars of patient blood management),\" urged all member states to \"promote the availability of transfusion alternatives including, where appropriate, autologous transfusion and patient blood management.\" Thereafter, regulatory agencies and scientifi c societies worldwide have developed guidelines and recommendations aimed to reduce the use of allogeneic blood transfusion and also to implement PBM programs. Among others, worthy of mention, the Australian National Blood Authority is in the process of developing six comprehensive modules of a PBM guideline. In particular, Module 2 (available at http://www.blood.gov.au/pbm-module-2 ) regards PBM in the perioperative setting.

On the basis of several observational studies and some RCTs, a causative relationship with transfusion has been shown for unfavorable outcomes, including higher mortality, more thrombotic events, organ dysfunction, infections, delayed wound healing, and increased length of hospital stay; transfusion has also been associated with cancer recurrence and insurgence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (for comprehensive reviews, see Vamvakas and Blajchman 2009 ; Shander et al. 2011 ) .

Therefore, till recently, the presence of low-grade anemia has been accepted as a matter of facts, eventually to be corrected through the liberal use of RBC concentrates. Blood components were considered safe, quickly effective, readily available, and relatively inexpensive.

More complex organisms rely on a higheffi ciency carrier for oxygen in the bloodstream, for at the atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen (21 %), the amount dissolved in the water solvent would not be suffi cient for life. Therefore, in mammals, the presence of an adequate quota of oxygen in the inhaled air, anatomical and functional integrity of the lungs and its vascularization, and adequate blood fl ow and hemoglobin content are critical for the survival of cells. Even simple organisms have developed mechanisms for sensing reduction in oxygen delivery; in more complex organisms, oxygen sensors are multiple, existing in cells (hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF), organelle (aortic and carotid chemoreceptors), and organs (kidney). When hypoxia occurs, these mechanisms become activated, ultimately leading to the adaptive phenomena that we observe during blood loss and anemia. In acute anemia, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO 2 ) and hemoglobin-oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) are maximized by means of an increased ventilation and a more effi cient ventilation/perfusion matching, occurring through a NO-mediated mechanism. The cardiovascular system undergoes fundamental modifi cations in response to acute normovolemic anemia: through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, after stimulation of vascular chemoreceptors, both heart rate and stroke volume are increased, the resulting cardiac output (CO) augmented up to threefold in the presence of intact adaptive mechanisms. Moreover, vasodilation occurs, determining a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Importantly, regional differences in CO are established, through differentiated degrees of vasodilation; thus, vital organs are initially preserved, the heart and the brain receiving a higher proportion of CO. Instead, the kidney appears to have a lower margin for compensation and becomes injured earlier, insomuch as hemoglobin concentration drops below 7 g/dl, during cardiac surgery (Habib et al. 2003 ; Karkouti et al. 2005 ) . Increased CO is also related to reduced blood viscosity and increased venous return, associated with vasoconstriction in the splanchnic district. The relevance of adrenergic activation as a compensative mechanism is highlighted by what has been considered a paradoxical effect of \u03b2-blockade during blood loss, that is, an increased rate of perioperative myocardial infarction (van Klei et al. 2009 ) and stroke (Devereaux et al. 2008 ) , following administration of adrenergic antagonists. Another compensative mechanism for tissue hypoxia is an increased peripheral oxygen extraction, consequent to lowered hemoglobin-oxygen affi nity (for increased 2,3-DPG, reduced pH, and NO-mediated events) and overall enlarged capillary bed. On the other hand, some organs reduce their oxygen demand, in front of an increase in consumption by the myocardium.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2222, "end": 2242, "text": "(Habib et al. 2003 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2243, "end": 2265, "text": "Karkouti et al. 2005 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2644, "end": 2665, "text": "(van Klei et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 2679, "end": 2703, "text": "(Devereaux et al. 2008 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Physiological Tolerance of Anemia"}, {"text": "In humans, tolerance of anemia has been addressed in observational studies, involving patients for whom transfusion is not an option, for unavailability or refuse; also, experimental investigations have been carried out in voluntaries.

In particular, in many European countries, ESA preoperative use is not approved, unless preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD) is scheduled.
