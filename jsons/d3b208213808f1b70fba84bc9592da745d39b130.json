However, the existing models to estimate the intervention does not take into account the realistic connectivity of the epicentres of the pandemic. We generalise our earlier model of interacting hotspots to test various possibilities of intervention in a model state consisting of multiple epicentres. We also analyse situations when the hotspots are spatially correlated and the interaction is limited to population exchanges with the nearest neighbours. We show that the heterogeneity in the infection propagation is solely dependent on the protocol of the containment and its strength. We explore many such situations and discuss possibilities.",

In each of the cases, the peaks in infected population in different cities take place at different times as indicated by the diffusion of data points. The diffused line around t \u2248 50 show the heterogeneity in the infection propagation. For CASE-II, the behavior changes for both the values of \u03b7(= 0.5 and 0). We show this in Figs. 1(c-d) when the exchange of Susceptible (S) and Recovered (R) populations destabilize the infection propagation indirectly. This behaviour is quite surprising as the direct exchange of infected populations between the cities is ruled out. Yet, for \u03b7 = 0, the prominent secondary peaks in the infection appear at later times in more than one city suggesting strong heterogeneity due to increasing disorder which is may be due to the complex coupling that exists between I and S, R. This becomes more prominent for CASE-III when all three types of populations commute between the cities (Fig. 1(c-d) ). The different behaviour in the individual cities becomes more diffused for both \u03b7 = 0.5 ( Fig. 1(e) ) and \u03b7 = 0 ( Fig. 1(f) ). However, in this case, many peaks have significantly smaller numbers with respect to the other cases, suggesting the role of the exchange in mediating disorder.",

For all the cases, P (I; t) is a delta function at t = 0, peaked at the initial values of the infection count at t = 0, which is uniform and identical in the given scenario. For all the cases, we see that there is a spread in the distribution with increasing elapsed time upto a maximum limit. The maximal spread in the distribution behaves non-monotonically with increasing t, peaked at t \u2248 50 for CASE-I with \u03b7 = 0.5 [ Fig. 2(a) ], when clear spread up to I \u2248 0.18 is seen. This shoots up to I \u2248 0.3 for the case with \u03b7 = 0 in Fig. 1(b) . This suggests that the probability to have large peak infection increases with increasing \u03b7. This particular trend is also observed for CASE-II for both \u03b7 = 0.5 [ Fig.2(c) ] and \u03b7 = 0 [ Fig.2(d) ]. The large asymmetry with respect to the peak infection in the evolution process suggest that even the exchange of both S and R between the cities can impact the recovery process when the recovery process dominates at large t. At significantly large t(= 125), there exist large probability to have very largely infected cities in the state which was not there earlier for CASE-I. For CASE-III, we see similar evolution for both \u03b7 = 0.5 and \u03b7 = 0.

            "text": "We now show the evolution of \u03c7 2 (t) for the respective cases of Fig.2 . For CASE-I, \u03c7 2 has a peak at t \u2248 50 with value (\u2248 0.004) for \u03b7 = 0.5 and no significant asymmetry is observed. For \u03b7 = 0, the peak in \u03c7 2 grows higher. For CASE-II, the height of the peak in \u03c7 2 for \u03b7 = 0.5 has similar values for CASE-I. However, for \u03b7 = 0, the peak in \u03c7 2 decreases significantly and develops significant asymmetry for CASE-II. The end of epidemic is defined for \u03c7 2 \u2192 0 when all the cities behave identically. This happens at a fairly large t after the peak that \u03c7 2 develops. For CASE-III, peak in \u03c7 2 has values smaller than that for \u03b7 = 0.5 for CASE-II. For \u03b7 = 0, the height in \u03c7 2 decrease significantly and later slowly decays with t and \u03c7 2 \u2192 0 at significantly large t. We now test the three cases (CASE-I, CASE-II and CASE-III) in a state, consisting of 10X10 cities (X, Y \u2208 L), spatially located in a grid of length L = 10 where each node is a representative of a city that follows similar equations of evolution. In contrast to earlier situations, the cities are now only allowed to exchange populations with the randomly chosen nearest neighbours following the identical governing rules (CASES-I,II and III) with \u03b7 = 0. In order to understand the dynamics of a realistic scenario, we choose a specific initial condition where only one randomly selected city has very large infected population (I = 0.2) while others have very small infected cases (with I = 10 \u22126 ) at t = 0.",

For all the three trajectories, the spatial maps are mostly identical for small t. We show the map of I(X, Y ) for t = 30 in Fig. 4(b) . The very high population at the initial city undergoes diffusion within this time window. No signature of the initial high value remains beyond t = 30. The situation is mostly similar for all the trajectories for different CASES. We now show the maps of I(X, Y ) in Figs. 4(c-e) at t = 80 for CASE-I, II and III respectively. I(X, Y ) contains many populated cities for CASE-I [ Fig. 4(c) ] while largely heterogeneous patches are seen in Fig. 4(d) for CASE-II. The map in Fig. 4(e) for CASE-III, has also many large patches of largely infected populations. At long times, t = 120, there still exist a few relatively small patches of infected populations that decay very slowly for CASE-III [ Fig.  4(f) ] which is not present for CASE-I. For CASE-II, the situation is somewhat intermediate. Fig.5(b) ] with t for the three cases shown in Fig. 4 . < I > has a value = 0 at t = 0 which is obvious. The initial decay in < I > also persist up to t \u2248 30. The peak in < I > grows in a similar manner. However, for CASE-II, the height of the peak in < I > is observed to be maximum while CASE-III has the slowest decay with increasing t[ Fig. 5(a) ]. The trend of data for \u03c7 2 is qualitatively similar to that for < I >[ Fig. 5(b) ]. The height of the maximum in \u03c7 2 is found to be maximum for CASE-II, at t \u2248 80 due to existence of strong heterogeneity as seen in Fig. 4(d) . For CASE-III, the decay in \u03c7 2 is observed to be the slowest which is also affirmed by the existence of the patches at t = 120 in Fig. 4(f) .",

The interaction was modelled using imposed disorder by exchanges of population of different kinds between the cities while the intervention parameter takes care of the fraction of population that a city retains before an exchange. We show that it is possible to control the heterogeneity in the infection propagation using the interplay between the intervention parameter and the complexity in the protocol. The control of heterogeneity essentially governs the fate of the containment strategy for the epidemic. The exchange model that we envisage here can easily be integrated with the existing models that takes care of many intermediate states between infection and recovery [4, 5, [14] [15] [16] [17] . Thus, the model is pivotal in shaping state-of-the-art non-pharmaceutical solutions to control the spread of the pandemic COVID-19.",
