            "text": "Coronavirus-induced common cold and allergen-induced rhinitis are characterized by nasal mucosal exudation of bulk blood plasma. The mucosal exudation process involves 'flooding' of the lamina propria with plasma-derived binding proteins and it is possible that subepithelial inflammatory cytokines and mediators may be moved by the exudate to the mucosal surface. In this study, we have analysed cytokine levels in nasal lavage (NAL) fluids from non-allergic subjects inoculated with coronavirus {n -20) and from subjects with allergic (birch pollen) rhinitis subjected to additional allergen challenge (samples were obtained 35 min post challenge) in the laboratory {n -10). Ten of the 20 inoculated subjects developed common cold and 10 remained healthy. Interferon-7 (IFN7), interleukin-1 /3 (IL-10), granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-4, and IL-6 were analysed in unprocessed NAL fluids using immunoassays. The subjects who developed common cold had increased NAL fluid levels of IFN7 {P < 005) that correlated well with the symptoms {P < 0 001). IFN7 did not increase in subjects with allergic rhinitis. IL-i/5 levels were similar in NAL fluids obtained from all inoculated subjects. In the subjects with allergic rhinitis NAL fluid levels of both IL-1/? and GM-CSF were increased [P < 0 05). GM-CSF was not detected in common cold. IL-4 and IL-6 were not detectable in any of the NAL fluids. The present cytokines may not only emanate from superficial mucosal cells. By aiding plasma exudation subepithelial cytokines may potentially also be retrieved on the mucosal surface. Our study provides original in vivo data supporting the notion that a TH-I profile of cytokines, notably IFN7, is present in viral infection and further supporting the view that GM-CSF is an important cytokine in allergic airways disease.",

The mucosal exudation process is preceded by extravasation of plasma. This primary 166 plasma exudate is flooding the lamina propria before it is cleared by non-injurious paracellular epithelial mechanisms into the airway lumen [4] . Hence, inflammatory factors emanating from epithelial and subepithelial airway cells may move to the mucosal surface particularly during the exudative phase of airways inflammation [5] .",

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) [6, 7] , IL-6 [8] , and interferon-7 (IFN7) [9] are pleiotropic cytokines with multiple effects in a series of immune, hematopoietic and other systems. A major biological activity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is to induce proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic and monocytic stem cells [10] . IL-4 appears to be essential requirement for IgE production whereas IFN7 inhibits this effect [11] . The possibihty that viral infection generates IFN7 is also of interest in view of the effect of this cytokine on T-helper (TH) cell properties. IFN7 may thus induce positive TH-1 immunity inhibiting the development of TH-2 dependent allergic responses [12] . On the other hand IFN7 may increase MHC class II expression on epithelial lining cells potentially abrogating an induced immune unresponsiveness [13] , Although there are numerous studies on cytokine generation by inflammatory cells and structural cells in vitro [14] , little is known of the in vivo appearance of cytokines on the human airway mucosa in inflammatory airway diseases.",

The presently sampled mucosal surface material, although it would contain large plasma proteins such as fibrinogen and a2\"inacroglobulin [1, 15, 16] , may, therefore, not necessarily contain mucosal injury-derived factors. In the absence of carrier proteins cytokines may not readily pass biological membranes/barriers [3] . However, plasma proteins such as Q2-rn3croglobulin have high efficient cytokine binding characteristics [3] and may thus promote lumenal entry of cytokines in exudative phases of airway diseases [4] . Hence the present cytokines may emanate both from superficial cells and lamina propria sources. The present differences in cytokine profiles between viral infection and allergy have not been explained. However, they might be a consequence of activation of distinct subsets of T-helper cells (TH-1 and TH-2). Since TH-I clones expressing mRNA for IL-2 and IFN7 have been associated with viral infection [23] [24] [25] it is gratifying to be able to record an increase in IFN7 output in the present study. TH-2 clones expressing mRNA for IL-4 and GM-CSF have been found in allergic inflammation [24, 26] . The profile of cytokine mRNA (IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and GM-CSF) in nasal mucosa biopsies observed by Durham et al. [27] , along with findings on cytokine mRNA profiles in the lower airways [28, 29] , supports the possibility that activation of TH-2 type cells occurs after allergen challenge. However, in the present study we could only demonstrate a clear increase in GM-CSF in allergic rhinitis. Since we employed different subject populations we cannot exclude the possibility that our data in part reflect the presence of different responder cells in allergic and non-allergic nasal mucosa. Further studies examining effects on cytokine levels in allergic subjects that have been infected by common cold virus are required to further elucidate this point.",

It is also clear that cells other than T cells, such as mast cells, macrophages, eosinophils, fibroblasts and epithelial cells may produce cytokines, particularly GM-CSF, which may be relevant to the allergic process. Inflammatory cell populations were not examined in the present study but allergen-induced rhinitis is known to be accompanied by a cellular infiltrate in nasal mucosa in which T helper cells, eosinophils and mast cells are prominent [31, 32] . Fraenkel et al. [33] have demonstrated that rhinovirus infection in humans may not increase infiammatory cells in nasal biopsies. Thus, other sources of mediators than increased cellularity in the airway mucosa may be responsible for nasal symp-toms in common cold. It is also possible that mucosal endorgans, including the subepithelial microcirculation, develop an increased responsiveness to mediators at viral infections [34] .",

[35] have recently reported that intranasal treatment with human recombinant IFN7 in an experimental rhinoviral infection in healthy subjects did not prevent rhinovirus infection or illness. On the contrary, this treatment enhanced the symptoms. There was also a correlation between mucosal IL-1/3 levels and common cold symptoms in the present study. The fact that \\L-\\0 is better known for its immunomodulatory than antiviral effects [6, 7] , may suggest that it may be more important in modulating the inflammatory response to infection than directly interfering with viral replication, per se. Furthermore, both IFN7 and IL-1,3 may upregulate expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on epithelial and endothelial cells [36] , ICAM-1, in addition to being an important adhesion molecule for inflammatory cells, is also the receptor for most of rhinoviruses and some coxsackie viruses [37] . Thus, it cannot be excluded that the release ofmucosalIFN7 and IL-l/?may amplify both the spread of infection and the inflammatory response in common cold.",

            "text": "A viral infection-induced production of cytokines, such as IFN7 and IL-1/3, in the airways may serve to promote the inflammatory response to other inhaled factors including allergens. Ida ei al. [38, 39] have found that virus incubation causes enhanced basophil activation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), containing basophils, have increased antigen-stimulated histamine release when evaluated during rhinovirus infections [40] . Furthermore, depletion of T-cells from PBMC before incubation with virus or incubation of virus-conditioned medium with anti-IFN7 monoclonal antibodies lead to inhibition of the histamine releasing activity, suggesting that IFN7 is a basophil function enhancing substance [41] . Moreover, recombinant IFN7 has been shown to promote eosinophil survival in vitro [42] and treatment of virus conditioned medium with anti-IFN7 monoclonal antibody has been demonstrated to inhibit the eosinophil survival enhancing activity of this medium [41] . There are also other potentially important interactions between viral infection-induced cytokine generation and cellular mechanisms of the allergic disease process [12, 13] . Although the role of viral infection in allergy and asthma attracts great interest [43, 44] , most of the information on the interaction mechanisms discussed above is based on in vitro observations with as yet only speculative relevance for the in vivo situation. We suggest that these interaction mechanisms may be studied in vivo with great advantage in the human nose. The nasal mucosa is not only very accessible to in vivo examinations. It is also potentially exhibiting mechanisms and functions that may be relevant to tracheobronchial airways as well [4] ,",

The present in vivo data on cytokine levels support the view that a TH-1 profile, notably IFN7, of these agents is present in viral infection. Our data further support the view that GM-CSF may be a major cytokine in allergic airway disease.",
