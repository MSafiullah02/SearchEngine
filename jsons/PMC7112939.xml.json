            "text": "Acute upper respiratory infections (URI) are the most common acute diseases in children. Large community studies conducted decades ago already showed that the mean annual number of acute respiratory infections is as high as 5 in children less than 5 years of age and about 3 in older children [1], [2], [3], [4]. Respiratory infections cause significant economic losses. In the United States, acute respiratory infections in 1998 resulted in an estimated 84 million visits to physicians; of which 25 million were due to upper respiratory infection and 13 million due to acute otitis media (AOM) [5]. Every fourth respiratory infection results in a visit to a physician; in infants, the proportion is rising to approximately one-half of all respiratory infections [6]. In children attending day-care centers in Finland, infectious diseases caused more than 90% of total costs of illness (deficient utilization of day-care centers, parents\u2019 lost working capacity, hospitalization, visits to physician, antibiotics) [7]. Viral respiratory infections can also lead to bacterial diseases, and mixed viral\u2013bacterial infections are often associated with antibiotic treatment failure [8]. Previously, viral diagnoses and etiologic studies of URI have had little relevance to the clinical management of individual cases. However, prevention and therapies for viral infections are developing, and both vaccines and antivirals for respiratory viruses other than influenza may be available in the near future [9], [10]. This poses new requirements for viral diagnostics, particularly rapid and easy detection of respiratory viruses.",

The proportion of virus-positivity can vary between studies depending on many different factors; the type of samples, detection methods, varying epidemiology of viruses and the study settings all may affect the results [3], [11], [12], [13].

In another study, 70% of children with purulent rhinorrhea as the only symptom had opacification of the paranasal sinuses on computer tomography scans [45]. Young children almost always have nasal secretions in paranasal sinuses during upper respiratory infections (so-called rhinosinusitis). Based on this, sinusitis in children could be considered a natural extension of the common cold. However, evidence of direct viral infection of the maxillary sinus in children is lacking. In adults with acute maxillary sinusitis, a virus can be found in 10% of maxillary secretion samples by viral culture [46] and in 40% by PCR [47].",

In a prospective study of children less than 2 years of age, about 43% of all upper respiratory infections were associated with AOM [43]. There is little doubt that viruses have an important role in AOM, but it is not yet clear which factors are crucial for the development of AOM. Does the virus need to invade the middle ear and infect the middle ear mucosa, or would inflammation at the nasopharyngeal end of the Eustachian tube be sufficient to interfere with the innate defences of the middle ear mucosa and facilitate bacterial colonization? Viral infections have been shown to cause dysfunction of the Eustachian tube. Two-thirds of children develop abnormal middle ear pressure when they have a common cold [58]. On the other hand, viral infection might facilitate colonization of the nasopharynx with pathogenic bacteria.",

The development of the PCR method enables detection of respiratory viruses for which antigen detection tests have neither been suitable nor available.

            "text": "Although viruses cause most of the respiratory infections, virus infections can also lead to bacterial infections. It has been recognized that during viral epidemics, e.g. influenza virus epidemics, the incidence of bacterial pneumonia and acute otitis media is increased [8], [76]. Viral infections facilitate bacterial colonization, adherence and translocation through the epithelial barrier of respiratory cells [8]. For example, in an animal model with chinchillas, otitis media developed in 67% of the animals inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza virus type A, whereas otitis media developed in 21% of the animals inoculated with S. pneumoniae alone and in 4% inoculated with influenza virus type A alone [77]. There are multiple potential mechanisms, which lead to increased bacterial adherence to respiratory epithelial cells during viral respiratory disease [8]. Firstly, viral infection causes physical damage to respiratory tract epithelium leading to impaired local defence mechanisms (e.g. loss of cilia and impaired function of Eustachian tube) and basement membrane exposure. Common respiratory viruses are able to cause defects in both cell ciliary structure and function, leading to loss of cilia and loss of ciliated cells from respiratory epithelium. Viral respiratory infections are also known to impair the cough reflex, which can together with the impaired ciliary function lead to accumulation of secretions and to an increased risk for bacterial superinfection [78]. In addition, viral infection in the nasopharynx causes inflammation in the Eustachian tube, which will interfere with the clearing functions of the middle ear mucosa, and hence, facilitate bacterial growth there. Secondly, during virus infection bacterial adherence to epithelium is increased by viral glycoproteins expressed on the host cell, virus-induced changes on host cell membrane and proteins absorbed from extracellular matrix. Inflammatory response to viral infection may up-regulate expression of molecules that bacteria utilize as receptors [8], [79].",

In a recent study, viruses and bacteria were detected simultaneously in more than one-third of children with acute otitis media [59]. Mixed viral\u2013bacterial infections often confuse the clinical picture of the disease; prolongation of viral disease may be due to bacterial co-infection or failure of antibiotic treatment of bacterial disease may be due to viral co-infection. For example, viral infection has been suggested to cause prolonged symptoms of AOM [80], and rhinovirus-positive culture in MEF has been associated with persistence of bacteria or occurrence of new bacteria in the MEF [81]. Mixed viral\u2013bacterial infections are also associated with antibiotic treatment failure [8]. It has been reported that in children even with adequate drug compliance virus infection was associated with an increased risk of bacteriologic failure of treated AOM [82], and that penetration of amoxicillin to MEF is lower in children with viral infection [83]. Controversial results have also been published, including a report that the duration of symptoms was longer in children with no detected pathogens in MEF than in children with bacteria or virus [50]. Acute viral tonsillitis or pharyngitis can also lead to a bacterial disease. However, it seems that especially in children, most often viruses or bacteria solely cause acute tonsillitis and mixed viral\u2013bacterial infections are rare [65].",

The newer group of drugs are neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir, which are effective against influenza viruses A and B [84]. Both inactivated and live attenuated vaccines have been developed for influenza viruses, but so far in annual vaccinations almost exclusively the intramuscularly administered inactivated vaccines have been used. The intranasally administered influenza vaccine contains live attenuated, cold-adapted influenza A and B viruses, and the vaccine has been approved to be marketed in the United States. A novel adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine administered intranasally has been associated with development of Bell's palsy [85]. It has been suggested that the Escherichia coli enterotoxin adjuvant in the vaccine might have been the risk-inducing factor, and that an induced response, rather than some direct toxic effect, led to the palsy [86].",

Due to its many different serotypes, developing a vaccine for rhinoviruses is unlikely. Treatment of rhinovirus disease is also problematic because infection often proceeds quickly and medication should be started as soon as the first symptoms occur or shortly thereafter. A capsid-binding agent, pleconaril, also effective against enteroviruses, has been the most promising drug to date and has demonstrated that developing a treatment for the main causes of the common cold is possible [87]. Unfortunately, since further studies revealed that pleconaril might have potential drug interactions, regulatory approval was not granted for the oral formulation of the drug. Other different treatment methods have been investigated, e.g. intranasal interferon [88], intranasally administered receptor decoy soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (tremacamra), 3C protease inhibitors rupintrivir and pyridone, and oral anti-picornavirus capsid-binder pirodavir [10], [87]. However, none of these medications are thus far in clinical use.",

However, recent development of modern microbiologic methods is also changing the world of virology; the knowledge of the respiratory viruses is broadening and even new viruses are being found [19].

Detection of a respiratory viral nucleic acid by PCR in the nasopharynx must also be interpreted cautiously because the presence of a virus alone does not establish causality of the concurrent illness. The introduction of PCR methods into clinical practice has resulted in the same questions and problems of clinical relevance as for other diagnostic methods. Laboratory findings must always be interpreted in association with clinical signs and symptoms.",
