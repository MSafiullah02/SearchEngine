            "text": "Reverse genetics, the ability to produce specific mutations followed by examination of phenotype, revolutionized the study of RNA viruses. The first successful attempts initiated infection of cells by inoculation with bacterial plasmids containing the viral cDNA inserts Taniguchi et al 1978, Racaniello and Baltimore 1981. However, production of in vitro RNA transcripts that were identical to the virion RNA (except for designed mutations and perhaps a few extra nucleotides at either terminus) allowed genetic manipulation using the standard inoculation procedures previously in use for virion RNAs (Ahlquist et al., 1984). The current ideal is to clone a full-length viral cDNA in a high-copy-number bacterial plasmid behind a promoter for a commercially available RNA polymerase. Most viruses with relatively small RNA genomes have been amenable for such a genetic system. However, some viruses are inherently difficult to clone due to the instability of the viral cDNA, often because the viral sequences are toxic to the bacterium Boyer and Haenni 1994, Lai 2000.",

            "text": "The cloning difficulties of some recalcitrant viral genomes have been surmounted by a variety of methods. In vitro ligation of individually cloned cDNA fragments followed by in vitro transcription and transfection was used to overcome the cloning difficulties of Yellow fever virus, Mouse hepatitis virus, Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and Beet necrotic yellow vein virus RNA2 Quillet et al 1989, Rice et al 1989, Yount et al 2000, Yount et al 2002. The disadvantages of this approach, though, are relatively low levels of full-length cDNA and reduced levels of RNA transcripts compared to that of in vitro transcripts from a complete clone in one plasmid. Another approach is to reduce the toxicity of viral sequences in high-copy-number plasmids by inserting introns into the viral sequences. Recently, cDNA clones of TGEV, Japanese encephalitis flavivirus, Pea seedborne mosaic virus, and Plum pox virus were stabilized by this method Johansen 1996, L\u00f3pez-Moya and Garcia 2000, Yamshchikov et al 2001, Gonz\u00e1lez et al 2002. This strategy, however, requires cytoplasmic viruses to have a nuclear phase and also requires that the viral sequences not have endogenous intron sequences, which has been suggested as a possible problem of large cytoplasmic RNA viruses (Lai, 2000). In fact, Tobacco\nmosaic virus (TMV) appears to be an example of such a virus with an endogenous intron, based on the fact that the infectivity of 35S:cDNA constructs are several orders of magnitude less than RNA transcripts and often are infectious in only certain plant species (W.O. Dawson, unpublished data). Moreover, most cells of tobacco plants with transgenes of the infectious cDNA of TMV behind the 35S promoter do not become infected from the transgene, although they do become infected via virus movement from other cells (Turpen, 1992). Yet another approach is to avoid the use of high-copy-number plasmids. The reticent RNA genome of TGEV could be propagated in Escherichia coli when cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome, a low-copy-number plasmid (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2000). Other approaches avoid the use of bacteria. Vaccinia virus was used as a vector to clone the coronaviruses, Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Human coronavirus\nCasais et al 2001, Thiel et al 2001. Although this approach allowed the cloning of the full-length coronavirus cDNA, the viral cDNA in the vaccinia virus vector is not very amenable for mutational analysis, requiring multiple cycles of ligation and recombination. Here we report an additional strategy to allow cloning of recalcitrant viral cDNAs in high-copy-number plasmids in E. coli that can be added to the repertoire of strategies available.",

We were able to maintain the plasmids containing the viral cDNA in only one strain of E. coli, which after transformation grew very slowly into minute colonies. However, we found that this level of growth was due to a fortuitous frameshift in the CTV cDNA that allowed its cloning by reducing the toxicity to E. coli. The corrected cDNA exhibited substantially greater toxicity to E. coli, now requiring 3 days to see visible colonies. Examination of other frameshift mutations demonstrated that 6\u20137 U\u2019s functioned as \u201cslippery\u201d frameshift sites, reducing toxicity to E. coli if positioned appropriately near the toxicity region in the viral cDNA. Thus, purposely introduced frameshift mutations into oligo(U) regions in a toxic viral cDNA can provide a compromise between infectivity and toxicity to E. coli. If hosts cells are susceptible enough to allow a reduction in infectivity, frameshift mutations can be inserted in the viral cDNA to allow cloning in high-copy-number plasmids of E. coli.",

However, E. coli transformed with purified plasmid DNAs of pCTV9R or pCTV-\u0394ClaR produced visible colonies slightly earlier. The yields of plasmid DNA from E. coli strain JM109 harboring pCTV9 and pCTV9R after overnight growth in 2xYT liquid medium were 2.5\u20133.0 and 1.5\u20132.0 \u03bcg of DNA per milliliter of culture, respectively, compared to 8\u201310 \u03bcg DNA per milliliter of culture for pTMV (Dawson et al., 1988). Thus, although the original CTV clones with the frameshift mutation reduced the growth of E. coli and plasmid DNA yields, the correction of the +1 insertion in pCTV9R further reduced the growth of E. coli to a level below the range of expectations for routine laboratory work. Although not quantified here, the degree of difficulty of ligating and isolating intact cDNA clones was proportionally increased with the increased toxicity of the repaired constructs.",

However, frameshifting also has been correlated with downstream structures Jacks et al 1988, Chamorro et al 1992. It is possible that the 6 U\u2019s at 3732 had an adventitious accessory structure downstream, and the frameshifting at this position was unusual. To examine whether other U-rich regions of CTV would similarly function as slippery-sequence frameshifting signals to recover infectivity and reduce toxicity in E. coli, we created frameshifts in other oligo(U) sites. A run of 6 U\u2019s occurs at four different places in ORF 1a at nts 1103\u20131108, 3726\u20133731, 4957\u20134962, and 7078\u20137083.

Since the original full-length (CTV9) and replicon (CTV-\u0394Cla) cDNA clones were equally toxic to E. coli (the repaired clones equally more toxic) (Fig. 6), the toxic region appeared to be located within ORFs 1a or 1b. The frameshift at nt 3732 reduced the toxicity of the original clones, suggesting that the toxicity domain was between nts 3732 and 11011. This location is supported by the observation that, when constructing cDNA clones for assembly of the full-length cDNA clone, we were able to clone the sequences between NcoI (nt 3685) and BstEII (nt 7775) only in the reverse orientation in pUC119 (pT36-Nco-Bst; Satyanarayana et al., 1999).",

Mutants with frameshift mutations between nts 3732 and 7084 (p\u0394ClaR-M1, -M4, -M5, -M6, pCTV9, and pCTV-\u0394Cla) produced colonies of 0.2\u20130.9 mm diameter at 1 day posttransformation (dpt) and 0.9\u20131.6 mm diameter at 2 dpt, respectively (Fig. 2, Fig. 6), compared to 1.5\u20131.8 and 2.6\u20132.7 mm diameter colonies containing pUC119 and pTMV at 1 and 2 dpt, respectively.

Thus, the frameshift mutations in ORF 1a around the IDR (p\u0394ClaR-M1, -M4, -M5, -M6) minimized the toxicity to E. coli, while the mutations introduced before (p\u0394ClaR-M3) or after (p\u0394ClaR-M2) failed to minimize the toxicity (Fig. 6), suggesting that the toxicity region was located between nts 3732 and 8390.",

However, Parkin et al. (1992) reported that a stem-loop structure 3\u2032 of the HIV \u22121 shift site was important for wild-type levels of frameshifting in vivo. Nevertheless, downstream structures appeared not to be needed in the observed repair of the frameshift mutations after replication in N. benthamiana protoplasts. We did not identify any common structures by examining the sequences with the MFOLD program (data not shown). Also, since we examined all of the 6 U-regions, none of which are thought to naturally be involved in frameshifting, there is no expectation that all would conserve some accessory structure needed for frameshifting.",

Additionally, numerous other slippery sequences have been identified Brierley et al 1992, Marczinke et al 1998, Kim et al 2001 and some of them occur throughout the CTV genome. We did not examine whether other potentially slippery sequences effect frameshifting in CTV. However, we examined six oligo(U) sites that allowed frameshifting when a mutation was created to destroy the reading frame. It would be expected that each of these sites also shift to an incorrect reading frame in the absence of mutations. If there are additional slippery sequences scattered throughout the CTV genome that also occasionally shift the reading frame, it is fortunate that sufficient full-length translation product is produced to allow efficient replication. Yet it is possible that slippery sequences serve as a survival mechanism for large RNA viruses. Viral RNA polymerases are known to be error prone (Drake and Holland, 1999) without an error repair mechanism, defining viruses as pseudospecies of sequence variants (Domingo et al., 1995). It has been argued that recombination and selection are the viral mechanisms to repair errors. Slippery sequences could serve as an additional repair mechanism. If a mutation occurs upstream of a slippery sequence, a frameshift could repair the mistake if the intervening altered amino acids are tolerated. Perhaps there is an advantage for CTV to have slippery sequences scattered throughout ORF 1a. This could be one of the reasons some CTV isolates have been observed to have a high degree of evolutionary stasis (Albiach-Mart\u00ed et al., 2000).",

However, the toxicity in E. coli was greatly reduced. Bacterial colonies were visible after 1 day, even though they were minute, compared to 2\u20133 days with the repaired clone. The progeny virus from the frameshifted clone was repaired; it did not contain the original frameshift caused by the inserted nucleotide and had a phenotype identical to the parental wild-type virus (Satyanarayana et al., 2001). Thus, the frameshift mutation appeared to have no negative impact on the value of the clones other than the initial reduction in infectivity.

            "text": "These results suggest that purposely inserting frameshifts at slippery sequences of viral cDNAs that are toxic to E. coli could be an additional strategy for cloning these viruses in convenient high-copy-number plasmids. The frameshift provides a compromise: a reduction of infectivity for a decrease in toxicity in E. coli. If the host system is susceptible enough to provide infection with a couple of magnitudes of decrease in infectivity, the frameshift should allow growth of an infectious clone in E. coli. If the host cells are even more susceptible, it is possible that two frameshifts could be used. As is evident from this work, all frameshifts in slippery sequences will not minimize the toxicity to E. coli. The frameshift must be positioned to prevent expression of the toxicity domain, similar to the insertion of introns for the same purpose. We examined only stretches of U\u2019s, but if the frameshifting occurred during translation, it is likely that other identified slippery sequences would also work. Since the repair of the frameshift mutations was due to in vitro transcription or translation in protoplasts, neither of which are virus-specific functions, the purposeful introduction of frameshift mutations into frameshift-prone sequences in front of toxic regions should work for any recalcitrant positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, this strategy provides an additional approach in the virologist\u2019s repertoire for developing reverse-genetic systems for difficult viruses.",

The +1 insertion mutation found at nt 3732 in pCTV9 and pCTV-\u0394Cla was corrected by reverse transcription of the region between nts 3559 and 4630 followed by amplification by PCR from the double-stranded RNA extracted from CTV T36 isolate-infected bark tissue. The amplified cDNA fragment was digested with NcoI (nt 3685) and Bsu36I (nt 4430) restriction endonucleases and followed by ligation into similarly digested pCTV9 and pCTV-\u0394Cla to obtain pCTV9R and pCTV-\u0394ClaR, respectively (Fig. 1A). CTV-GFP-p23 was obtained by precisely exchanging the CP ORF with that of GFP in CTV-CP/p23 (Satyanarayana et al., 2002a). Subsequently, the +1 insertion mutation found at nt 3732 in CTV-GFP-p23 was removed by exchanging a DNA fragment between NcoI and Bsu36I from pCTV9R to obtain CTVR-GFP-p23 (Fig. 3A).",
