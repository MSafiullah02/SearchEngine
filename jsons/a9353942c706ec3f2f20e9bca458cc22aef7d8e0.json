The mining sector is not immune to these impacts, and the crisis has the potential to have severe consequences in the short, medium and long-term for the industry. Understanding these impacts, and analysing their significance for the industry, and the role it plays in wider economic development is a crucial task for academic research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The primary impact on the sector has been a dramatic contraction in demand as industrial production, and construction, has effectively halted across a large swathe of the planet, for a period yet to be determined. This reduction in demand has caused dramatic falls in the prices of a range of metals and minerals across March and April 2020 (Table 1 ). These falls have been most dramatic for aluminium and copper. A clear difference however between Covid-19 and the GFC is the experience of the gold industry. In the aftermath of the GFC gold prices surged as investors moved their money out of equities and into the safe-haven of gold. Gold prices rose 156% between November 2008 and September 2011. 3 However as shown in Table 1 gold prices are in decline, and indeed slumped further in mid-March to a low of US$1474.25 on March 19, 2020. Investors and businesses have moved away from even the supposed safe haven of gold, choosing instead to hoard currency such as the US dollar, needed to fund businesses who have faced unprecedented drops in revenue. The impact of this effect can be seen by comparing the share price of Ashanti Gold, a Ghanaian based gold mining company with operations across Africa, during the GFC and now. Between November 2008 and November 2010, the company's share price rose by over 160%. Between February 24, 2020 and March 20, 2020, the company lost 38% of its value, before recovering slowly by early April, but still over 20% down from just over 6 weeks before.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 341, "end": 349, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 724, "end": 731, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Surveying Potential Impacts"}, {"text": "In addition to impacts through lower prices mining activity itself has been hit directly by Covid-19.

Teck Resources has halted construction of a copper mine in Chile, along with reducing production and crews at coal and copper projects. 7 Yamana Gold has reduced production and demobilised workers in Canada and Argentina. 8 Coal miners in Illinois have been furloughed. 9 These cut-backs to supply have helped buttress some of the falls in demand, and account for some of the rises in prices seen in late March and early April.

In many countries the higher gold price seen in the GFC encouraged, induced and incentivised the growth of Artisanal and Small-Scale (ASM) gold miners, causing environmental degradation and deforestation, but crucially providing income, foreign exchange and livelihoods to countries, regions and individuals. What the impact on those involved in this sector will be from the lockdown, falling prices, and reduced demand is an important question for future research. This is especially important given the increasing evidence of an inter-linkage between agriculture (and therefore food security) and ASM in many countries (Bryceson & J\u00f8nsson, 2010; Maconachie, 2011; Hilson, 2016) , and the role that the activity plays in providing a safety net to many of the poorest communities in the world (Aizawa, 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 817, "end": 843, "text": "(Bryceson & J\u00f8nsson, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 844, "end": 861, "text": "Maconachie, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 862, "end": 875, "text": "Hilson, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 989, "end": 1003, "text": "(Aizawa, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Taking Action"}, {"text": "Those employed in the large-scale mining sector will also be impacted across the world, potentially in both the short and medium term.

Mineral rents as a percentage of GDP are higher than 15% in Mongolia, Suriname, Mauritania, Eritrea and Guyana (World Bank, 2020). These countries face a dilemma of shutting down mining activity (if possible) to reduce the spread of the virus, against reduced tax revenue at a time of huge fiscal stress.

The scale of the global recession that is likely to occur as a result of the pandemic will depend upon how fast and far countries move out of lock-down, and how governments deal with the financial implications of the crisis. On the one hand economies may bounce back quickly, given that no productive capacity has been destroyed (as was the case in economic collapses following wars), and that there hasn't been widespread reductions in the global money supply, such as that occurred in the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash and the GFC. On the other hand, lockdowns may continue sporadically over months or years with implications for global industry and construction, reducing the overall demand for minerals and thus reducing production, prices or both. This raises the prospect in the medium-term of over-supply in some markets, with potentially sunk investments in the sector that either need to be mothballed or operated at reduced profits or even losses. This could translate to lower returns for shareholders, lower investment in the industry -leading to reductions in efficiency, lower investment in community, social and environmental projects, squeezes on wages -impacting livelihoods and lower tax receipts for governments often critically dependent on revenue from the sector.
