As a large department we are expected to support the acute specialties, urgently rationalise care, reduce patient footfall and design a new working pattern that protects both staff and the public. We have the crucial responsibility to adjust our practice to both reduce the spread of disease and free up capacity within the system. In this paper we describe our local strategy in terms of leadership, reconfiguring our service and utilising all options in our armamentarium to provide as safe a service as possible.",

This catalysed an early Trust and departmental response. There was a progressive increase in the number of cases and reports of seven University of Oxford students being affected by 20th March 2020. 6 On 14th March 2020, Oxfordshire had the largest reported number of cases for any UK region totaling 14 (London was divided into boroughs) out of a population of 687,524. By 23rd March 2020, it was ranked 34th, with 63 identified cases. By 14th April 2020, it was ranked 16th, with 890 identified cases 7",

My role is likely to change further, with the proposed implementation of a rota system that will see a smaller number of doctors covering multiple specialities at once, in order to cover inevitable staff shortages and absence.Being on the front line brings with it a great deal of pressure and responsibility. There is a great deal of anxiety amongst juniors and the psychological impact of this situation on staff should not be underestimated. Not truly knowing what lies ahead, having to adapt to constantly evolving patterns of work, knowing that we can be redeployed at any given moment, is very unsettling. Daily, new policy and guidance is released, which can be overwhelming whilst also conflicting. Beyond the coming weeks and months there remains the niggling uncertainty relating to the implications for our future careers, having recently been told that training rotations, examinations and speciality interviews have been cancelled.All this, on top of the fear of contracting the virus ourselves or passing it on to our loved ones, has left me feeling at times like the situation is bleak. Though the uncertainty can be scary, it can and is also uniting and reminding us as a profession why we chose this path in the first place, which is first and foremost to serve.\"",
