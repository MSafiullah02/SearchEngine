Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2500 coronaviruses and computed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that the 3' and 5' are the most structured elements in the viral genome and the 5' has the strongest propensity to associate with human proteins. The domain encompassing nucleotides 23000 -24000 is highly conserved both at the sequence and structural level, while the region upstream varies significantly. These two sequences code for a domain of the viral protein Spike S that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and has the potential to bind sialic acids. Our predictions indicate that the first 1000 nucleotides in the 5' can interact with proteins",

To investigate the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with human proteins, we employed catRAPID 18, 19 . catRAPID 20 estimates the binding potential of a specific protein for an RNA molecule through van der Waals, hydrogen bonding and secondary structure propensities allowing identification of interaction partners with high confidence 21 . The unbiased analysis of more than 100000 protein interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RNA reveals that the 5' of SARS-CoV-2 has strong propensity to bind to human proteins involved in viral infection and especially reported to be associated with HIV infection. A comparison between SARS-CoV and HIV reveals indeed similarities 22 , but the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV is still unexplored. Interestingly, HIV and SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV, have a furin-cleavage site occurring in the spike S protein, which could explain the spread velocity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 23, 24 .

In general, proteins associated with retroviral replication are expected to play different roles in SARS-CoV-2. As SARS-CoV-2 massively represses host gene expression 49 , we hypothesize that the virus hijacks host pathways by recruiting transcriptional and post-transcriptional elements interacting with polymerase II genes and splicing factors such as for instance A-kinase anchor protein 8-like AKAP8L and La-related protein 7 LARP7 that is upregulated in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 40 .",
