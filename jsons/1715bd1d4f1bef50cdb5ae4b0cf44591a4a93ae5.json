(25) With hospital admissions overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published an algorithm to ensure appropriate ICU admissions (Figure 5) . Factors taken into consideration when making such decisions are age over sixty-five, frailty -assessed via the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)and comorbidities. Special considerations should be made in patients with long-term disabilities, learning disabilities and autism. In such cases an individual assessment of frailty must be performed. (46) Figure 5 : NICE algorithm for appropriate critical care referrals (46) NICE encourages intensivists to start critical care therapy with clear targets or outcomes from the start. It recommends frequent reviews with simultaneous assessment of response to treatment. Critical care treatment should be withdrawn when the outcomes set at initiation of treatment are not reached and the patient fails to improve. Decisions must be communicated with the patient when possible and their family, carers and/or independent mental capacity advocate, if appropriate.

In children, epinephrine is the drug of choice, with norepinephrine supplementation if septic shock persists. (25) Another familiar drug that may be viable for COVID-19 is chloroquine; it is traditionally used as an antimalarial as well as against autoimmune diseases. The mechanism of action of chloroquine increases the endosomal pH above that required for virus and cell fusion whilst also interrupting the glycosylation of cellular receptors in similar viruses such as SARS-CoV. When chloroquine is introduced to Vero E6 cells infected with COVID-19, it appears to treat the infection at both entry and post-entry stages of infection. Chloroquine may also enhance immune modulation of cells, potentially increasing efficacy of the drug in vivo. In general, chloroquine is cheap and safe to use, and is widely distributed to all organ systems including the lungs when taken orally (Figure 7 ) (63). Oncological drugs are another class with growing interest. Some oncology drugs -whilst laboratory results are promising -cannot be tolerated by humans due to the required dose being significantly higher than the established therapeutic dose for other diseases. Conversely, anti-inflammatory drugs have been suggested due to the significant effect of inflammatory responses on lung damage and resulting mortality. Table 4 details three anti-inflammatory agents trialed on COVID-19. Their underlying mechanism of action involves inhibition of JAK-STAT signalling thus decreasing the extent of elevation of cytokines seen in patients with COVID-19 (64).

Additionally, strict handwashing habits and respiratory hygiene must be followed by individuals to curb the spread of the respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. (39) Ferguson et al. predict that without control measures, the deaths in the UK and US will reach 510,000 and 2.2 million respectively due to the coronavirus alone with 81% of the UK and US populations becoming infected (Reproduction Number (R0) = 2.4). The number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds required is expected to reach 30 times the available number in both countries. With an aim to reach R0\u22641, the study recommends a combination of social distancing and case isolation in combination with household quarantine or school and University closures for a duration of 5 months, with maximum effects felt if all four interventions plus complete lockdown (i.e. individuals prevented from going to work) are implemented. Such measures are predicted to result in a decrease in the number of critical beds required by two-thirds, a figure which equates to 8 times the number of available ICU beds at present.
