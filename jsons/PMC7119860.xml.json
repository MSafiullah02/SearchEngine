Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is included in group I together with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E). CCoV is an enveloped (+) RNA virus that is 27\u201332 kb in length (Siddell, 1995) and causes moderate or severe enteritis in pups. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome is occupied by open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b, the expression of which yields large polyproteins. Downstream to ORF1b, there are smaller ORFs which encode for the structural proteins S, E, M, for the nucleocapsid (N) protein and for a number of presumptive non-structural proteins (Luytjes, 1995). Virus isolation onto cell cultures and electron microscopic examinations appear to be useful tools, for the diagnosis of CCoV infection. Therefore, CCoV is difficult to isolate in vitro and the common presence of coronavirus-like particles in faeces requires confirmation by other diagnostic methods.",

By comparative sequence analysis of the M gene and fragments of the pol1a and pol1b genes, it has been observed that CCoVs segregated in two separate clusters. The first cluster was intermingled with reference strains of CCoV genotype and therefore could be assigned to this genotype. The second cluster segregated separately from CCoV and FCoV genotypes and therefore these isolates may represent genetic outliers (Pratelli et al., submitted for publication). Recently, severe enteritis has been described in two different pups which had been caused by CCoV, as confirmed by PCR. The viruses, unfortunately, were not isolated in cell culture. The sequence analysis of the PCR products of the M and S genes carried out on the faecal samples from the two pups confirmed that the FCoV-like CCoV had caused the disease (personal observations).",

The target sequence is a fragment of the gene encoding for the membrane protein M of CCoV, as reported previously (Pratelli et al., 1999). The primer pair CCoV1/CCoV2 amplified a 409 bp fragment. For the n-PCR, the first amplicon was subjected to a second round of amplification using the CCoV2 and CCoV3 primers and the same PCR cycling procedure. In a previous study, similar nucleotide substitutions in the binding site of the internal primer CCoV3 used for the n-PCR were demonstrated in the sequence analysis of the PCR products from five faecal samples of pups with diarrhoea. These variations were assumed to affect partially the efficiency of the n-PCR amplification, with the production of an undetectable amount of c-DNA. Moreover, these nucleotide substitutions occurred consistently in all five samples examined (Pratelli et al., 2001a) and the sequence and phylogenetic analyses performed on the entire gene identified the viruses as FCoV-like CCoV. Based on these preliminary results an internal primer flanking the variable region (CCoV1a) was chosen on the basis of the mismatch between the typical CCoV and FCoV-like CCoV strains (Fig. 1\n). PCR was then performed with the primer pair CCoV1a/CCoV2, where the sense primer CCoV1a was able to detect these atypical CCoVs.",

CCoV shedding in faeces occurs over a range of 6\u201314 days post-infection (Keenan et al., 1976, Tennant et al., 1991), although virus faecal shedding in infected pups has been detected by n-PCR for periods of up to 37 days (Pratelli et al., 2001b). The detection limits of virus isolation have been overcome by the development of PCR and n-PCR for the diagnosis of CCoV (Bandai et al., 1999, Pratelli et al., 1999, Naylor et al., 2001). Furthermore, sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the M gene clearly confirm that two different clusters of CCoV circulate in the dog population (Pratelli et al., submitted for publication). To date, the sequence analysis is the only available method to identify the two genotypes of CCoV. To overcome this diagnostic limit, a PCR assay has been developed for the rapid identification of FCoV-like CCoV from faecal samples of naturally infected pups. This test may be instrumental in furthering epidemiological studies on the occurrence and distribution of CCoV strains in dog population.",
