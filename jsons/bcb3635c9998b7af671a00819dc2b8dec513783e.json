            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been reported in more than 200 countries, claiming massive illnesses, hospitalizations, and death tolls. 1, 2 Following the declaration of a national emergency in the U.S. in response to COVID-19, 3 42 states and Washington DC issued stay-at-home orders from March 19 to April 7. 4 These orders covered approximately 95% of the U.S. population. 4 Closely related to the stay-at-home orders are various non-pharmaceutical interventions that aim to promote social distancing. 5, 6 One of the most widely adopted policy interventions across the states is school closures. 7, 8 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended school closures in response to community transmission of COVID-19. 9 All 50 states and Washington DC have issued executive orders on school closures, and most states issued these orders during March 13-23. 7, 8 To date, no state has lifted school closure orders, and it is likely for the school closures in most places to continue for the rest of the 2019-2020 academic year. 10,11 It remains unclear whether and on what scale schools will reopen after the summer break, as such decisions by states are primarily contingent upon how the COVID-19 pandemic evolves in the coming months. 12, 13 The COVID-19 pandemic may expose children to an evaluated risk of childhood obesity. 14, 15 Childhood obesity is associated with various immediate and long-term illnesses such as sleep apnea, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis, and certain types of cancer. 16, 17 In the U.S., childhood obesity prevalence has increased by 3-fold over the past few decades. 18, 19 In 2017-2018, approximately 18.5% of children aged 2-19 years (13.7 million) had obesity. 20 Non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics have higher childhood obesity prevalence than non-Hispanic whites and Asians. 20 Physical inactivity among children is one of the major behavioral risk factors for childhood obesity. 21 The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (2nd edition) recommends 60 mins or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily among children. 22 However, more than 3 quarters (76%) of children in the U.S. do not meet the daily physical activity (PA) level recommended in the guidelines, 23 and nearly half (47%) of U.S. children exceed 2 h per day in sedentary behavior. 24 Physical education (PE) is a mandated part of the school curricula in most states. 25 PE contributes to children's daily accumulation of PA and is of particular importance for those who have obesity or lack access to PA opportunities in their home environment. 26 Because schools have been closed nationwide, children in the U.S. have missed their opportunity to participate in PE classes and other school-based PA activities (e.g., recess, after-school sports programs). 27 They are also less likely to make up for it under the stay-at-home orders, as parks and outdoor recreation areas across the states are closed, thus limiting PA opportunities outside. 27, 28 In sum, the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the obesogenic environment conducive to physical inactivity and sedentary behavior. 29 Children living under such conditions are likely to be exposed to an elevated risk for energy imbalance and unhealthy weight gain. 29, 30 Given the looming influence of COVID-19 on PA and the deep uncertainties about how the pandemic may evolve in the future, 29, 30 it is critical to assess the impact of COVID-19 on childhood obesity and project its trajectory in response to the pandemic. Such information will be valuable to policymakers at federal, state, and local levels, as well as to various stakeholders (e.g., schools, communities, and families), in designing and implementing countermeasures to minimize the detrimental impact of COVID-19 on PA and prevent children from obesity onset.",

The study sample's trajectory of BMIz and childhood obesity prevalence was compared between the control scenario without the COVID-19 pandemic and 4 alternative scenarios with COVID-19. Scenario 1 assumed a 2-month nationwide school closure due to COVID-19 in April and May 2020. Scenario 2 assumed that Scenario 1 would be followed by a 10% reduction in daily PA in summer from June to August. Five technical details regarding model specifications are noted. First, the model runs by an increment of a month, but a 2-month time interval during the spring and fall academic terms was adopted to simplify the reporting and illustration of modeling results. Second, states and school districts follow different academic calendars so that the exact start and end dates for academic terms and the summer break differ. However, such geographical and school information was unavailable in the ECLS-K:2011; thus, we were unable to model child-specific school schedules.",

Third, a 10% reduction in PA during the summer break was assumed based on a study of adult Fitbit \u00ae users in the U.S. (i.e., a 12% reduction in PA due to . 32 In the sensitivity analyses, an 8% and 12% reduction in PA during the summer break were used to assess their respective influence on model estimates.

Using the interpolated height and weight together with children's recorded sex and age (in months), BMIz were calculated using the 2000 CDC age-and sex-specific growth chart. 35 Childhood obesity is defined as BMIz \u2265 the 95th percentile in the growth chart. 36",

In such cases, the microsimulation model would provide a conservative estimate for the impact of COVID-19 on PA reduction and childhood obesity. Admittedly, children may make up for their lost PA opportunities at school by engaging in additional PA at home.

It would not be appropriate to extrapolate their BMIz and childhood obesity to 2020-2021. Instead, the microsimulation model assumed that the ECLS-K:2011 study sample all started school in September 2019 (i.e., kindergarteners in 2019 would share the same height and weight distribution as those in 2011), interpolated their height and weight using restricted cubic spline regressions until March 2020, and then simulated changes in BMIz and childhood obesity prevalence from April 2020 to March 2021 under the control and four alternative scenarios. Based on the CDC reports, the childhood obesity rate among children aged 6-11 years increased only modestly from 17.7% in 2011-2012 to 18.4% in 2017-2018. 20,33 Since the microsimulation model aimed to project the change in BMIz and childhood obesity rate rather than their baseline level, the discrepancy resulting from a modest difference in childhood obesity rate between 2010-2011 (i.e., the baseline of the ECLS-K:2011) and 2019-2020 (i.e., the baseline of the microsimulation model) is unlikely to cause significant estimation bias.",

Therefore, counting reduced EE exclusively from canceled PE classes during school closure is likely to provide a conservative estimate regarding the impact of COVID-19 on EE among kindergarteners.Due to nationwide stay-at-home restrictions and closures of exercise facilities (e.g., YMCA, gyms, recreation centers),29,30 kindergarteners' PA is likely to be adversely affected during the 2020 summer break. On average, elementary school children in the U.S. participate in 88 min of PA per day. 23 Although no published work to date has estimated the influence of COVID-19 on PA among U.S. children, data collected from U.S. adult Fitbit\u00ae users revealed a reduction in daily PA by about 12%. 32 The microsimulation model thus assumes a 10%, or 8.8-min, reduction in daily PA among U.S. kindergarteners, equally divided between MVPA (4.5 METs) and LPA (1.8 METs) time.
