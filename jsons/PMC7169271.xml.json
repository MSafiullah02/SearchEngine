Differentiating between neoplastic and inflammatory etiologies for these mass lesions is important as the management and prognosis of these two disease processes is different.3, 4, 5, 6 Identification of imaging features that can differentiate between these two conditions can help guide clinical decisions and may go on to be applied to mass lesions in regions that are more challenging to biopsy.",

They receive afferent lymph vessels from the tongue, tonsils, oral, nasal and pharyngeal cavities, salivary glands, external ear canal, larynx, esophagus, and surrounding lymph nodes.9, 10 Neoplastic enlargement of lymph nodes has been reported to occur either from primary immune system neoplasia such as lymphoma, or from lymphatic or hematogenous metastasis from primary neoplasia, most commonly arising within the afferent lymphatic drainage field.6, 10 Common neoplasms that metastasize to the medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes have been reported to include tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas, mast cell tumors, thyroid carcinomas, and sarcomas and carcinomas of the maxilla, nasal cavity, and aural region.2, 6 Clinical reports have indicated that patients with neoplasia primarily present for the presence of a cervical mass, and additionally with lethargy, anorexia, coughing dysphagia, Horner's syndrome, and anemia has been described possibly as a result of the primary neoplasm4, 11, 12 Lymphadenitis has been classified into noninfectious and infectious types. Noninfectious lymphadenitides have included autoimmune or idiopathic forms and are poorly documented in the veterinary literature. Infectious lymphadenitis has been reported secondary to bacterial (Mycobacterium spp., Pasteurella spp., Bacteriodes spp., Fusobacerium spp., Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Bartonella spp.), fungal (systemic histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and sporotrichosis), protozoal, algal, or metazoal infections and can have suppurative and nonsuppurative forms.13, 14, 15 Lymphadenitis has been described as a primary or secondary condition and has been associated with other diseases such as juvenile cellulitis (puppy strangles) in which diffuse lymphadenomegaly can be observed.5 Secondary lymphadenitis has been reported in response to the lymphatic drainage of inflammatory agents and/or their products. Disruptions in lymph drainage have been suggested as an underlying cause for edema, inflammation, abscessation, and granulomatous reaction. Clinical reports of dogs with lymphadenitis have described signs of lethargy and pyrexia associated with leucocytosis and visible lymph node enlargement.13, 14, 16\n",

Additionally both can exhibit central necrosis with central poorly contrast\u2010enhancing areas on postcontrast pulse sequences. The presence of fat stranding and reticulation of the fat adjacent to nodes have been related to cervical lymphadenitis using computed tomography. Extracapsular spread and invasion of adjacent tissues have been described as MRI features of neoplastic lesions.17 These features have been suggested as a possible way of helping to differentiate between neoplastic and inflammatory mass lesions in the neck, however to the authors knowledge no study has directly compared these lesion types.18 The MRI appearance of metastatic lymphadenopathy due to thyroid carcinoma and mast cell tumor dissemination have been documented in dogs. However, the MRI appearance of inflammatory mass lesions have not been described in dogs and there has been no study that compares the MRI features of lymph node mass lesions of neoplastic and inflammatory etiologies in dogs or cats.",

They were evaluated by a two European diplomates in veterinary diagnostic imaging (P.J.J. and P.P.), who was aware of the study design however were unaware of the final histopathological diagnosis. The cases were evaluated independently and when there was discrepancy in the results a consensus was reached. The images were evaluated with the use of image viewer software (OsiriX Imaging Software\u00a9\nosirix@osirixviewer.com) on a computer (Apple\u00a9 Cupertineo, CA) and the display settings could be adjusted as each radiologist desired. Subjective characteristics recorded for each lymph node mass included the following: lateralization (unilateral or bilateral), margination (smooth or irregular), the presence of cavitation, the loss of nodal hilus structure (Fig. 1A\u2013C), the T2\u2010weighted signal pattern of the masses (homogeneous or heterogeneous), and where possible the contrast\u2010enhancement characteristics of the mass lesions (diffuse or peripheral, heterogeneous, or homogeneous). Objectively each mass lesion was measured for maximum height and width on transverse images by each observer. A width:height ratio was calculated from these two measurements. Characteristics of the perinodal fat and musculature were evaluated for contrast enhancement and grouped as none/mild or, moderate/marked. Perinodal contrast enhancement was classified as none, mild when the change was confined to the fascial layer immediately adjacent to the lesion, moderate when reaction extended along local fascial planes, and marked when contrast enhancement involved distant tissues several fascial planes from the mass (Fig. 2A\u2013D). Additionally, the presence of contrast enhancement within the local muscles was documented. Other lymph node enlargement or additional abnormal imaging findings were also noted.",

Dogs were assigned to inflammatory or neoplastic groups based on histopathologic or cytologic diagnosis in the medical record. The prevalence of specific clinical and MRI features was calculated within each etiological group (neoplastic vs. inflammatory). A correlation between the two observers for the mass dimension measurements was performed using the Pearson's correlation. The mean of the two measurements between the observers was calculated. The age, average height, and average width measurement data were identified as being not normally distributed via the Shapiro\u2013Wilk's test (P > 0.5) and a visual inspection of their histograms, normal Q\u2010Q plots, and box plots. Statistical difference between the two groups was therefore calculated using a nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test with demonstration of an exact P\u2010value. A P\u2010value threshold of 0.05 was used to signify statistical significance. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were formed for height, width, and age to identify ability for these measures for group prediction. Cut\u2010off thresholds were calculated when a factor was considered a good or excellent test (area under the curve (AUC) 0.8\u20131.0). For the clinical factors and the subjective MRI characteristics, statistical difference was tested using the Fischer's exact test (P < 0.05). When a clinical or MRI feature was significantly more likely to occur in one group then positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated.",

An age of 6.5 years was identified as being the most sensitive and specific cut off from the receiver operating curve statistics. This finding is consistent with the veterinary literature in which neoplasia is associated with an older age demographic and lymphadenitis is mostly reported in young dogs.4, 16, 24 Similarly, in human medicine, cervical lymphadenitis is described predominantly in children and young adults.15, 19, 25 The historical finding of lethargy was significantly more likely to be present in the nonneoplastic inflammatory group than the neoplastic group. This is consistent with the literature that report tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma\u2010bearing patients infrequently present with lethargy or anorexia, although when present, these signs are associated with a significantly shorter survival time and a poorer outcome.4 Dysphagia has also been reported in these patients.4 In our study four cases with neoplastic masses presented with dysphagia may have been due to the mass effect compressing on the oropharyngeal region or from invasion of hypoglossal nerve, which runs along the medial aspect of the medial retropharyngeal lymph node and provides motor innervation to the tongue for participation in the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing.16\n",

These clinical signs have been described widely in relation to cranial cervical lymphadenitis both in the human and veterinary literature and have been related to the extension of inflammation outside of the lymph node capsule, and the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines.16, 25, 26 An underlying cause for the lymphadenitis lesions was not identified in the majority of cases and they were therefore presumed to be immune mediated. Despite 12 of 16 of the lymphadenitis lesions being cultured only one yielded bacterial growth. This might be due to the administration of antibiotics prior to presentation of the culture\u2010negative cases. In children, the most common cause for lymphadenitis is an acute bacterial infection including mycobacterial infection extending from the oropharynx or elsewhere.15, 27 In dogs, lymphadenitis has been associated with Bartonella henselae, Talaromyces helicus, mycobacterial infections, and juvenile cellulitis (puppy strangles).3, 13, 14, 24, 28\n",

The size of normal medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes has been assessed with MRI in dogs and described as having an approximate width of 5\u201310 mm and a height of 10 mm.8, 29, 30 The width and height dimensions of the mass lesions were significantly larger in the neoplastic group in our study however the height:width ratio was not statistically different between the neoplastic and inflammatory groups. The ultrasonographic dimensions of lymph nodes have been assessed for their ability to differentiate neoplastic from nonneoplastic nodes in dogs. Similar to our findings neoplastic lymph nodes were identified as being larger when compared with nonneoplastic (hyperplastic or inflammatory) lymphadenomegaly.31 Despite these findings, it is important to bear in mind that in both the medical and veterinary literature it is reported that size is not a reliable marker for neoplastic infiltration, as small nodes can harbor small metastases.32, 33, 34, 35 The presence of perinodal enhancement and muscle contrast enhancement was significantly more likely to be associated with an inflammatory rather than a neoplastic etiology. The high presence of perinodal contrast enhancement and inflammation around inflammatory lymph nodes is consistent with those findings described in computed tomographic studies of lymphadenitis lesions and lymph node abscessation where fat stranding, reticulation, and peripheral contrast enhancement is described.18, 36\n",

Our inclusion criteria required patients to have mass lesions and were therefore at a late stage of metastasis or had an advanced inflammatory lesion. As a result of this chronicity these late\u2010stage lesions exhibited destruction of hilus structure, capsular invasion, and central necrosis to a similar degree.",

This study only assessed T2/T1\u2010weighted imaging features and contrast enhancement, however in medical imaging the use of diffusion weighted (DW) MRI has been utilized to help differentiate between lymphadenitis and malignant retropharyngeal mass lesions. It was identified that signal intensity ratios on DW MRI was found to be higher and apparent diffusion coefficient values lower in suppurative lymphadenitis when compared to malignancies.38 Further investigation into these techniques in veterinary patients to assess its utility in the differentiation of these conditions could be an avenue to examine the future.",

Features that were statistically more common in neoplastic lesions included an older patient presenting for a nonpainful mass lesion and having a significantly larger mass lesion on MRI.
