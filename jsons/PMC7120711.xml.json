Mass gatherings are defined as public events \u2013 organized or spontaneous \u2013 that are held for a certain time period and attended by more than 25,000 people. Mass gatherings events can involve sporting events, religious, social, cultural, or political congregations, as well as gatherings of displaced populations due to natural disasters or conflict. Public health risks associated with mass gatherings include infectious disease outbreaks, non-communicable diseases, injuries, environmental exposures (such as heat-related illnesses), and trauma [2\u20134].",

First, since travel is a central and critical aspect of mass gatherings, a robust understanding of the spatial movements and interactions of certain populations is essential to assessing the health risks associated with a mass gathering event. The seasonality and timing of the mass gathering event are also crucial because public health risks are usually correlated with the temporal and spatial distribution of travelers to and from the city where the mass gathering event is hosted. Moreover, environmental and seasonal factors play a clinically relevant role in the infectious activity of pathogens with strong seasonal patterns (i.e., due to the effects of climate). Finally, in countries where public health surveillance and reporting infrastructures are often suboptimal, specialized and focused efforts \u2013 such as those on spatial data infrastructure and volunteered geographic information \u2013 are vital in the implementation of robust data gathering methods, enhanced analytic capabilities, and improved capacity for electronic disease surveillance [5, 13].",

Pilgrims are thought to have carried the cholera bacteria from an endemic area in the lower Ganges to populations in the upper Ganges, from there to Kolkata and Mumbai, and across the subcontinent. Then, British soldiers and sailors transported the bacteria to Europe and to the Far East. The epidemic ended very abruptly in 1824, after a harsh and cold winter [14, 15]. In 2013, the same Haridwar-based event attracted approximately 80 million pilgrims between January and April. It is estimated that at least 16 million people were present at the height of the festival on April 14 [16]. Despite much rapid monitoring and public health interventions, diarrheal diseases (such as cholera) continue to be a risk at these mass gatherings today.",

During the first Hajj in 632 A.D., the pilgrims reported having a fever-like illness known locally as \u201cYethrib fever,\u201d which is now believed to be malaria. Other major epidemics such as plague and cholera have been reported at the Hajj. In recently years, the number of people attending this event has doubled in the past decade, reaching three million in 2012; however, in 2013, concerns over a new SARS-like respiratory virus caused the attendance to decline to two million [17]. To place this event in its local context, the influx of pilgrims almost doubles the resident population of Mecca (which is approximately 1.4 million) every year [18]. Because the venue does not change and the event occurs annually, this mass gathering event provides the medical community with an excellent window of opportunity to research infectious diseases that not only affect a mass gathering event but also have the potential for pandemic spread [19, 20].",

In July 2008, an outbreak of influenza was reported at the World Youth Day in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. This outbreak was caused by several strains of influenza viruses, and the spread was expedited by crowded accommodation and low rates of vaccination [23]. Other similar outbreaks have been reported at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA; and pandemic influenza A H1N1 has been reported at music festivals in Belgium, Serbia, and Hungary [24\u201327].

Although the spread of infectious diseases has been reported in relation to the Hajj, the earliest and best modern examples were outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness [30]. Food-borne and water-borne outbreaks of infectious diseases have the potential to spread very rapidly and on a large scale. Factors that influence the spread of infectious diseases include: the types of infections that are endemic to the host country, the types of infections that are endemic to the home countries of the visitors, and the manner in which the populations mix and interact. These factors can be amplified by the international travel and the subsequent dissemination in the home population \u2013 which is often faster than the incubation period of almost all infections. Furthermore, the spread of infection and drug-resistant organisms is expedited by the rapid mass movement and mixing of infectious and susceptible populations [14]. The infections that are likely to arise are also partly determined by the type of event \u2013 for instance, events with overcrowded accommodations will be more susceptible to outbreaks of respiratory infections, where as those with excessive consumption of recreational drugs and alcohol could increase the likelihood of sexually transmitted infections [31].",

The dynamics of transmission are determined by: incubation time, whether the infection is transmitted through droplets or is airborne, and nature of the infectious agent. Examples of respiratory infections are: influenza and other respiratory viruses, tuberculosis, measles, mumps, and meningococcal meningitis. Tuberculosis is a respiratory infection with a long incubation time. Because tuberculosis infections can remain latent for months to years, transmissions are often not noticed during mass gathering events. Although transmission has been reported during air travel, there is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that air travel is an important source of tuberculosis infection [32].",

For instance, in 1998, an outbreak of leptospirosis was reported among triathlon athletes in Springfield, Illinois, USA, where 11 % of tested participants were positive for the infection. This large outbreak likely arose from athletes drinking contaminated lake water, and demonstrated that unusual infections can occur among those who come into contact with fresh water during mass gathering events in temperate countries [33].",

Studies in Mecca have found that extreme environmental temperatures led to a major disaster \u2013 more than 1,000 deaths from heatstroke in just a few days [6].

Data collection and reporting of public health intelligence during a mass gathering event have been challenging tasks because of the large numbers of attendees, the rapid and large-scale movements of people, and their fairly short stay at the mass gathering event. Deploying VGI-based technology at mass gathering events is an effective way of gathering and disseminating public health information (as more than 90 % of the global population is covered by mobile phone networks and more than 140 countries provide third-generation wireless telecommunication services) [70\u201374].",

The goals were to use smart devices to assist in the early detection of emerging outbreaks of infectious diseases, and to improve the efficiency of case reporting and operational effectiveness, by using meaningful data visualizations and geo-statistical analyses with geographically tagged data (Fig. 3.2). This project monitored nine infectious diseases: pandemic influenza A H1N1, influenza-like illness, meningococcal meningitis, viral hemorrhagic fever, plague, yellow fever, cholera, foodborne illness, and poliomyelitis. Questionnaires about these diseases were uploaded to a central server, and wirelessly disseminated to laptops and smart devices in Saudi Arabia at different points of data gathering. Field investigators were assigned to local clinics and hospitals in and around Mecca. Real-time information from these investigators was quickly analyzed and synthesized by epidemiologists and presented to public health officials in the form of daily reports.\n",
