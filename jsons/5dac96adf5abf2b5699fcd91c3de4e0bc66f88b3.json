An initial bolus of 5% dextrose in normal saline or Ringer lactate (20 mL/kg of body weight) is infused over 15 min, followed by continuous infusion (10-20 mL/kg/h, depending on the clinical response) until vital signs and urine output normalize. Crystalloids are equally effective as colloids in fl uid resuscitation. -Normalization of the hematocrit is an important goal of early fl uid repletion. -However, a normal or low hematocrit may be misleading in patients with overt bleeding and severe hypovolemia. Close clinical observation is essential, even after normal blood volume is restored, because patients can develop shock for 1-2 days after initial fl uid resuscitation, which represents the period of increased vascular permeability in dengue hemorrhagic fever. Plasmodium falciparum infections acquired in areas without chloroquineresistant strains, patients should be treated with oral chloroquine. A chloroquine dose of 600 mg base (=1,000 mg salt) should be given initially, followed by 300 mg base (=500 mg salt) at 6, 24, and 48 h after the initial dose for a total chloroquine dose of 1,500 mg base (=2,500 mg salt). For chloroquine-resistant strains, treatment options are as follows: -Quinine sulfate: Quinine has a rapid onset of action and, in combination \u2022 with tetracycline, doxycycline, or clindamycin, it has been shown to be a very ef fi cacious treatment option for P. falciparum infections acquired in regions with chloroquine-resistant strains. Artemisinin derivatives clear parasites very rapidly, are now a key compo-\u2022 nent of malaria treatment worldwide, and have been shown to reduce mortality in severe malaria compared with parenteral quinine. Artemisinin-based combination therapies, including artesunate-me fl oquine, artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine, and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, are highly ef fi cacious. Under the CDC protocol, intravenous artesunate is administered in four \u2022 equal doses of 2.4 mg/kg of body weight over a period of 3 days. The dosing schedule recommended by the WHO entails doses every 12 h on day 1 and then once daily. Up to 7 days of therapy may occasionally be indicated in very ill patients. \u2022",
