            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has not only had severe political, economic, and societal effects, it has also affected media and communication systems in unprecedented ways. While traditional journalistic media has tried to adapt to the rapidly evolving situation, alternative news media on the Internet have given the events their own ideological spin. Such voices have been criticized for furthering societal confusion and spreading potentially dangerous \"fake news\" or conspiracy theories via social media and other online channels. The current study analyzes the factual basis of such fears in an initial computational content analysis of alternative news media's output on Facebook during the early Corona crisis, based on a large German data set from January to the second half of March 2020. Using computational content analysis methods, reach, interactions, actors, and topics of the messages were examined, as well as the use of fabricated news and conspiracy theories. The analysis revealed that the alternative news media stay true to message patterns and ideological foundations identified in prior research. While they do not spread obvious lies, they are predominantly sharing overly critical, even anti-systemic messages, opposing the view of the mainstream news media and the political establishment. With this pandemic populism, they contribute to a contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview, as portrayed in detail in this analysis.",

            "text": "Despite the public worries and accusations, the actual contribution of alternative news media and populist voices to public confusion in the Corona crisis remains unclear, also due to the difficulties of analyzing some of the high-impact channels with limited or no application programming interface (API) access. There were early and important steps in analyzing, for example, Twitter discussions (Chen et al., 2020) , but for some countries, other channels were more relevant due to their wider reach; in the case of Germany, only 2% of the population (14+, German speaking) use Twitter on a daily basis, while 21% use Facebook daily (Beisch et al., 2019) . Unsurprisingly, many alternative news media publishing in German maintain public Facebook pages with a notable audience, reaching large segments of society either directly or via shared posts. Therefore, we focused on such outlets in this working paper, documenting an initial computational content analysis of Facebook pages of alternative news media in the (early) Corona crisis. Our data set was limited to the case of Germany and the aforementioned entities, and it covered the initial weeks of the pandemic (up until the decision to introduce a generally binding, national prohibition of contact on March 22, which can be seen as a new phase of the crisis). However, this working paper is part of an ongoing research effort, so subsequent publications are planned to cover the Facebook activities of traditional news media as a contrast to the present paper and to further extend the analysis period. Our aim is to offer substantial data on the public debate of Corona in Germany so that we can move beyond the stage of speculation on who is contributing to such a debate in a potentially risky way. Furthermore, we hope to add to the international research efforts in untangling the communicative confusion that developed parallel to the pandemic and to uncover generalizable patterns of pandemic populism that seem to be co-evolving with the spread of the virus itself.",

Often, this kind of alternative content aims at shaping public opinion according to an agenda that is perceived as \"being underrepresented, ostracized or otherwise marginalized in mainstream news media\" . Following this logic, many alternative news media sites position themselves as an explicit counter-force or watchdog to \"mainstream news media,\" which also explains a somewhat paradox self-perception: while they need to differ from the mainstream by definition, they are also strongly tied to it, like a mirror image.",

Populist communication combines the transmission of populist content in the sense of a \"thin-centered ideology\" (Mudde, 2004 ) that combines the assumption of a homogeneous and pure people with anti-elitist attitudes and the assumption that elites prevent the true reign of the people (see Schulz et al., 2017) , with a certain communication style, often characterized by sensationalism and strong emotions (Wirz, 2018) .

Following a multi-level triangulation approach, we first identified all online media with more than 500,000 unique users using the AGOF database (AGOF, 2019); then, we trimmed the list and excluded all non-journalistic outlets (for a similar approach, see Steindl et al., 2017; Weischenberg et al., 2006) , and identified online newspapers within this list based on the literature (particularly, Buhl et al., 2018; Sch\u00fctz, 2012) and our own investigations. Through this analysis, we identified 80 national and regional online newspapers. Seventy-eight of them hosted at least one active Facebook page at the time of data collection. Only the main page for each newspaper was incorporated in our data base.

This class of methods, like document clustering or topic modeling, does not require predefined dictionaries, but still requires some interpretation and decisions of the researcher to find a fitting structure that is not only mathematically acceptable, but also sound when it comes to the meaning of the generated categories (G\u00fcnther and Quandt, 2016) . To identify the underlying thematic focus of alternative media, we used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA; Blei et al., 2003) , an unsupervised learning algorithm that can discover latent topics inductively based on patterns of terms occurring together. The algorithm can detect to what extent each word of the corpus characterizes the respective topic (\u03b2) and how far each topic is present in each document (\u03b3), so each post can be a mixture of more than one topic (G\u00fcnther and Domahidi, 2017) . Before estimating the topic model, the number of topics (k) has to be predefined. To find the ideal k, a series of 2 to 50 topic models were computed based on training and test samples using the LDA function of the R topic models package (Hornik and Gr\u00fcn, 2011) . We found that the model of k = 11 had a large increase in predictive power. This finding and the corresponding parameters have also been confirmed using the R ldatuning package (Nikita and Nikita, 2016) . The eleven topics were characterized by inspecting the top terms and most representative documents for each topic. The interpretation was validated by word and topic intrusion tests (Chang et al., 2009) , checking whether an independent coder could identify terms and topics that were randomly assigned, but not representative for the respective topics.",

It is noteworthy that fact checkers not only monitor alternative news channels but also address Internet scams, online chain letters, incidents of offline fraud (e.g., tricksters posing as members of the health department), and misleading headlines or pictures, which can be described as poor reporting of mainstream journalism. However, we focused only on debunked \"fake news\" and conspiracy theories in this paper. Often there were related versions of the same story, only differing in singular aspects like the suspected culprit of the conspiracy. While the fact checkers have taken up many of these different forms (hence the number of 282 Corona-related posts), we have summarized them in the overarching narratives, resulting in four conspiracy and fake news stories (for a detailed description see Section 5.4). We constructed a dictionary for each story and applied it to the sample in order to check whether the respective stories were covered in the alternative news media. This is admittedly a rather direct and simple, but nevertheless valid, procedure since the stories were always connected either with concrete persons (e.g.,\"Wolfgang Wodarg\" or \"Bill Gates\") or specific keywords (e.g., \"laboratory virus\").",

In the context of our study, it also has an advantage over the widely-used concept of disinformation, as it does not imply intentionality, which we cannot infer from a content analysis alone. That said, we would like to point out that the use of the term is a very narrowly defined one in the context of this article. In a first step, we compared alternative and mainstream media by their output, potential reach, interactions, and shares. Unsurprisingly, we found that the traditional mainstream media had a much higher output of posts referring to the Corona crisis, both in total and by the average number of posts per page (see Table 1 ). The first reported infection in Germany on January 28 (tagesschau.de, 2020) and the complete lock-down in Italy's Lombardy region at the end of February (CNN Editorial Research, 2020) seem to have influenced the amount of coverage in both media types, but with a more noticeable effect on the mainstream news media due to their higher absolute number (see Figure 1 ). The time-based graph shows two spikes around these dates, a typical pattern of event-based bursts (Buhl et al., 2019 (Buhl et al., , 2018 . During March, the coverage in the mainstream media grew massively, seemingly mimicking the exponential spread of the virus in society-a reaction to the now strongly perceivable medical, political/regulatory, and societal effects reflected in the increased reporting. While the overall number of posts of the alternative news media was much lower, they also followed the same growth pattern (see Section 5.2.2).",

Our analysis showed that even though the mainstream media outlets were dominating the overall information environment on Facebook, single posts by alternative news outlets reached a comparable number of interactions and shares to those published by mainstream outlets, indicating that these might have developed considerable impact in their respective audience group.",

An eleven-topic model emerged as the ideal solution to describe the underlying topical structure (see Table 2 ). Notes: LDA with k = 11, \u03b1 = 0.05, sampling method = Gibbs A first inspection of the resulting topics revealed some that more or less fit traditional mainstream media reporting, such as Topic 1, which includes the number of infections and the measures to deal with the pandemic. Others topics clearly fit alternative news media's heterodox, anti-establishment perspective or right-wing position, like Topic 9, which refers to an anti-migration narrative linked to Corona. Still others used the pandemic as clickbait or a buzzword to simply draw attention, like Topic 11, which also included links to products and services.",

The sixth topic, again picks up the panic-mongering element, but condenses it to a criticism of a fear-inducing system of (mainstream) media and politics per se. For example, it speculates on recurring patterns and similarities between the climate change debate and the pandemic, implying some strategy behind it. This has the components of a conspiracy theory and again refers to the already existing narration of climate change activism being either misguided or part of some societal steering.

That particular Monday was the date of the first two Corona-related deaths in Germany (n-tv.de, 2020). In the days that followed, a growing number of German ski-tourists returning from Austria showed signs of infection, and the Austrian state of Tyrol was declared a risk area by the German Robert Koch Institute on March 13 (Robert Koch-Institut, 2020c). The Austrian government quarantined some of the popular ski areas on the same day, leading to chaotic scenes of tourists desperately trying to leave the area (Willim, 2020; Dahlkamp et al., 2020) . In subsequent days, more and more areas and countries were added to the list of risk zones, while the number of infected as well as the death toll were growing at a worrying rate. The troubling developments all over Europe lead to several countries closing their borders and imposing drastic measures to slow the spread of the virus. Unsurprisingly, we see notable growth in most of the topics during that phase, in parallel to the overall increase in news output. The mushrooming of various doom-and-gloom scenarios (Topic 7) during that dramatic period is especially notable, even more so the emergence and rapid growth of the topic of national cohesion (Topic 8). This can be plausibly explained as a reaction to the perceived threat and, partially, as a \"rally around the flag\" effect. In the case of right-wing populist media, this does not necessarily extend to the political actors (which are seen as representatives of \"the system\") but to the nation as the unifying entity. That said, the topic category at least contains a notable number of neutral posts on the actions of leading politicians, which deviates from the norm of overly critical remarks in alternative news media. In particular, the television address of Chancellor Merkel on March 18 (Tagesschau, 2020) and her call to solidarity were welcomed with unusual restraint.",

Group entities (and even nations, s. Cohen, 2012) are similarly portrayed as unified persons, implying their actions as deliberate and coordinated, that is, organization A does something and then organization B reacts. Such reporting scales down complex processes to the level of situational interaction and face-to-face communication, and thus transfers it to the real-world experiences of the audience, which also makes complex processes easier to grasp. It can be argued that this form of reduction is even more relevant in the Corona crisis where the threat comes from a virus that cannot be directly perceived and is not embodied, and as such, remains on a conceptually abstract level (while still being very real in its effect). The analysis of actors, in a broad sense, therefore allows for a deeper understanding not only of who is frequently referred to as an important person or enemy, but also of the construction of the story, and thus, the logics and functioning of the reporting. For the current analysis, we identified the most frequent named entities in the data set (excluding nations, as they were not central to our research interest; see Section 4). Unsurprisingly, the most prominent entities mentioned were the political actors coining the crisis, both national and international (see Table 3 ). German Chancellor Angela Merkel was, by far, the most frequently named actor in the crisis, followed by the federal government as an entity, and the Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn. American President Donald Trump was fourth on the list. Other national actors in the top list included a number of central political figures, but also two interesting deviations: Wolfgang Wodarg (a medical doctor and former politician who publicly criticized the threat by COVID-19 as exaggerated and the political handling as inappropriate and dramatizing a low-risk, flu-like infection) and Christian Drosten (virologist and advisor to the government). The latter two were portrayed by alternative media as antagonists in the debate, signifying a critical heterodox view (Wodarg) versus a mainstream scientific perspective (Drosten) (see also Section 5.4).",

It seems plausible that this is a continuation of this negative narrative, which means that links to the pre-existing narrative were constructed to stay consistent with the worldview. For example, some sarcastically mention a \"Corona panic\" to supplant the \"climate panic\" (e.g. in Topic 6, Section 5.2). A closer inspection revealed that Thunberg was, for example, criticized for visiting the EU parliament at the beginning of March, despite Corona-related prevention measures already being in place.",

Further, the list included most of the German parties represented in the parliament, but it is interesting to see that the frequency of mentions did not necessarily reflect their relative percentage in the last elections, or their relevance in decisions being made, for that matter. In particular, the right-wing nationalist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party scored disproportionately higher than other parties in that respect; it was the sixth most frequently mentioned actor, after the ruling Christian Democrats (CDU), but in front of the second coalition partner, the social democrats (SPD). This does not necessarily reflect notable activities during the crisis, but is rather a manifestation of the right-wing populist viewpoint of many of the alternative news media (Frischlich et al., 2020) . So again, this is a continuation of a pre-existing narrative, where the AfD represents a critical viewpoint to the established parties, and the crisis is forged into this general worldview.

For this purpose, we conducted a co-occurrence analysis of the most frequently named entities. In such an analysis, the terms were positioned according to their links to the other (most frequent) terms in the data set, forming a network of more or less densely connected words. This allowed for the identification of strongly connected sub-networks (e.g., if some terms always co-occur with some others in a certain part of the network, but never with terms outside of this substructure) and central terms which co-occur with many other terms (as they are relevant for many topics).

Very central and highly connected actors are, for example, Chancellor Angela Merkel, the government, the Minister of Health, Spahn, and the ruling party, CDU. They are connected to multiple terms, which reflects their presence in various contexts, and they are closely linked to a core cluster of words centrally located in the network, which primarily consists of terms describing the domestic situation and the (political) measures against the spread of the virus. In particular, Merkel is seemingly omnipresent and linked to numerous terms from that cluster; in addition, she dominates her own sub-structure of terms referring to her public televised address and her political actions as head of the administration (on the lower left of the network). Some facetious or critical terms either connected to Merkel or the government are also seen, indicating the anti-systemic, heterodox perspective of many alternative news media, for example, \"rhombus woman\" (a derogatory term referring to Merkel's signature hand position in public situations). In contrast to this, other frequently mentioned entities are central to sub-networks that are only weakly linked to the core national structure. International actors like Recep Erdogan, Sebastian Kurz, Emmanuel Macron, or Donald Trump, are primarily connected to terms describing one specific topic (as also mentioned in Section 5.2), for example, the migration narrative in the case of Erdogan, or the state of emergency narrative in the case of Trump. These actors represent a specific topic. Other actors are connected to a very small number of terms (like Greta Thunberg), and in some cases just one (like the virologist Christian Drosten, who is just linked to the term Corona, as he's defined by the virus in his function of being a scientific expert).",

Further, their coverage revolves strongly around national topics and systemic criticism, which is in line with the expectations based on the literature (see Section 2.2) that identified a strong heterodox, right-wing spin in many alternative news media. Accordingly, the handling of the crisis by political actors is subject to a judgmental analysis and polemic commenting based on viewpoints and patterns established before the pandemic (as visible by using concepts and derogatory terms already introduced during the refugee crisis and before, as in the case of Angela Merkel).

Although the risk analysis exists, the framing by the alternative news media gave the story a misleading twist. Conspiracy theorists portrayed the risk analysis as a secret simulation game of the government preempting the actual disease, implying causality and some long-term planning and involvement of the administration.

He framed this notion in a way that implied panic mongering as a main driver of the crisis. Conspiracy theorists used Wodarg's statements as a reference to claim that the pandemic would be a major \"fake.\" Some of the alternative media turned this into a \"duel\" between Wodarg as one legitimate opinion, and the other one being one of the country's leading virologist, Christian Drosten, who served as an advisor of the government during the pandemic and publicly countered Wodarg's statements. The personalizing of the conflict served alternative news media's general narrative; Wodarg symbolizes their heterodox viewpoint opposing \"the system,\" while Drosten symbolizes the orthodox perspective of the administration and the societal mainstream. Notably, some mainstream media relied on the same antagonistic perspective and picked up the topic in a similarly personalized way. The group of Wodarg-related messages elicited a comparably high number of interactions, potentially indicating a larger interest by the audience and an accordingly higher potential impact (naturally, this would need to be confirmed by survey studies).",

However, when analyzing the data set, we found many of these posts and messages show up in a secondary distribution system, for example, the story on the risk analysis of the German government posted by MMnews on January 29 was taken up by several conspiracy theorists' YouTube channels (e.g., Schrang TV) and AfD members (e.g., Martin Sichert and Alice Weidel) (Fehringer et al., 2020) and thereby the document created over 15,000 interactions and potentially reached over 2.5 million users solely via Facebook. These channels, in turn, took the posts as reference for their own worldviews; through relaying the messages into a secondary system, alternative news' messages became credible sources and proof for a deviant, heterodox perspective. For instance, a large-scale content analysis of a popular right-wing YouTube channel showed that alternative news media were used frequently as evidence for the credibility of the worldview transmitted there (Frischlich et al., 2020) . In that sense, their potential influence and contribution to societal confusion may be indirect.",

The observed recontextualization of information, plausibly with the goal of undermining trust in public statements and policies (EEAS, 2020b) , and the adaption of events in alternative news media's general, anti-systemic meta-narrative, is likely to sow uncertainty and confusion. And uncertainty can, in turn, benefit authoritarian worldviews (Duckitt and Fisher, 2003) and even extremist positions (Rieger et al., 2017) .",

Here, the messages of alternative news media are referenced as sources and critical voices that speak the truth (in contrast to professionalized mainstream media).",

First, we focused on a single, specific country (Germany), a relatively short time frame (initial phase of spreading and first pandemic phase), and examined only the Facebook activities of the most relevant alternative news media within the country. A subsequent analysis will shed some light on the parallel Facebook activities of mainstream media (in an upcoming working paper of the authors). Naturally, comparative data from other countries, further social media channels, and a longer time period, might be helpful in verifying what we deduced as more general principles from the given case, and in particular, the information strategies of alternative news media in the Corona crisis.",

Nevertheless, alternative news media contribute to public confusion by their specific framing strategies and by constructing a contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview, which calls any official statement into question. This may be dysfunctional for social coherence in an unprecedented time of crisis; still, such communication largely operates within the given limits of discourse in a liberal democracy. Moreover, studies on the association between the consumption of alternative news media and risky behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic are missing so far. Thus, while we know more about the content through the present study, the actual effects on the users are just (plausible) conjectures.",

It may also be argued that especially in times of crisis, the strength of a democracy is first and foremost reflected in its open and plural debates, even if some of it is not particularly helpful or even hostile, as documented in our preliminary analysis of alternative news media's coverage during the Corona crisis.",
