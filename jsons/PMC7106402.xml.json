            "text": "Pathogenic human and animal viruses found in aquatic environments are usually shed from feces (enteric viruses), urine, and respiratory secretions from the infected host and enter into sewage water. The human viruses belong to different viral families. The most common viruses that are widely dispersed in sewage around the world include hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus, astrovirus, parvovirus, coronavirus, poliovirus, and other enteroviruses (Hellmer et al., 2014; Laverick et al., 2004; Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2005). Not only human enteric viruses and animal pathogens, but also other viruses can be found in waters contaminated with sewage (Bosch, 1998; Cantalupo et al., 2011). If the pathogens are not removed in the treatment plants, they will be released into natural watersheds where many of them can persist for long periods (Fong and Lipp, 2005; Kotwal and Cannon, 2014). New hosts might be infected with these viruses through direct contact with contaminated water or by drinking it or by eating animals such as mollusks that have filtered and concentrated viruses from sewage-contaminated water (Nenonen et al., 2008).",

Gross pollutants and most organic and inorganic solids are removed during these steps. The effluent is thereafter either discharged into a receiving water system or reused for other purposes. Little is known, however, about the efficiency of removal of human viral pathogens from sewage by conventional treatment. Several studies have shown that such treatments are efficient for the reduction of the parasites Giardia and Cryptosporium and for bacteria but have little effect on adenoviruses and enteroviruses (Li et al., 2015; Ottoson et al., 2006a; Rodriguez-Manzano et al., 2012). Additional disinfection after conventional treatment is applied in some treatment plants to further remove pathogens, such as treatment with peracetic acid, chlorination, and ultraviolet irradiation (Das, 2001; Kitis, 2004). These treatments are efficient for inactivating and removing bacteria and protozoa, but not for most enteric viruses (Freese and Nozaic, 2004; Shannon et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Ozone treatment is an alternative for removing microcontaminants in sewage because ozone is an extremely reactive oxidant and thereby a powerful disinfectant. It has been used for disinfection of drinking water in Europe since 1906 (Rice et al., 1981) and has also been installed in some sewage treatment plants (Oh et al., 2007; Rakness et al., 1993). The disinfecting ability of ozone treatment has been shown to be efficient for bacteria and parasites in clean water (Kim et al., 1999; Peeters et al., 1989), and this treatment also has been shown to reduce the concentrations of enteric viruses and bacteriophages (Burleson et al., 1975; Kim et al., 1980). However, the ability of ozonation to inactivate pathogens in wastewater might be hampered due to the high contents of organic materials in sewage (Burleson et al., 1975). One mechanism for reducing viable viruses in water by ozone treatment is assumed to be due to a conformation change of the viral capsid proteins by oxidation that either destroys the capsid or suppresses the virus/host cell receptor binding by changing the viral capsid proteins (Shannon et al., 2008). Previous studies conducted in wastewater treatment plants have shown that ozone disinfection might be highly efficient in inactivating bacteria and bacteriophages after conventional sewage treatments (Kim et al., 1999; Tyrrell et al., 1995), but knowledge regarding its effect for reducing human enteric viruses is relatively scarce.",

The initial treatment is mechanical with two parallel screens and an aerated grit chamber. The subsequent biological treatment includes activated sludge and reactors with carriers of active biofilms, and this is followed by a chemical treatment step where ferric chloride is added prior to the sewage entering the two final parallel sedimentation basins. Before release into the recipient river (Knivsta\u00e5n), the effluent passes through a pond for the removal of phosphorus-containing fine particles. In 2015 an additional ozonation step treating the entire wastewater flow was added at the end of this process line. The full-scale ozonation step is divided into two parallel lines with a total maximum capacity of 560 m3 effluent wastewater per hour. The ozonation step includes lifting pumps, the production of ozone in generator units, the injection of ozone by static mixers, contact tanks, and final contact filters. Each line contains two lifting centrifugal pumps (APEX ISF C, Bristol, UK), one static mixer (NR Mixer, Statiflo International Ltd, UK), one 50 m3 stain-less steel contact tank with 5 m water depth and two compartments, one ozone destructor for off-gas (Primozone, Sweden), and two contact filters with a total area of 25 m2 filled with 1 m light-expanded clay aggregates (Leca, Saint-Gobain Link\u00f6ping, Sweden) for potential stripping or quenching of ozone residues in ozonated wastewater. The ozone is produced from evaporated liquid oxygen with >99.5% O2 (YaraPraxair, Sweden) diluted to 98% O2 by addition of air in an ozone generator with a maximum production capacity of 2.4 kg O3/h (GM48, Primozone, Sweden). An ozone dose of around 6 mg/L is added to the effluent wastewater through static mixers that transfer more than 98% of the added ozone to the wastewater. Most of the ozone reacts or degrades rapidly after the addition to the wastewater. Analysis of the water samples in the inlets and outlets of the contact tanks show ozone concentrations of 1\u20133 mg O3/L and 0.1\u20130.3 mg O3/L respectively. To verify that adequate amounts of ozone are transferred, the removal of pharmaceutical residues was calculated based on frequent inlet and outlet samples, and the results showed a typical removal efficiency for an ozone dose of 6\u20137 mg O3/L, which is also reported in other studies and is related to total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations (Beijer et al., 2017). The hydraulic retention time in the contact tanks was on average 46 min and the minimum and maximum retention time was 15 and 180 min, respectively, during the period of ozonation that began in August 2015 and ended in February 2016.",

The reason for the identification of viruses in the outlet after the dam system despite the fact that they were not detected by qPCR after ozonation is unclear, but two circumstances identified during the evaluation of the operation of the treatment plant might explain these findings. During week 49, the protective sieves for the lifting pumps in the ozonation step were partly clogged with large particles released by high hydraulic flow in the treatment plant leading to by-pass of 4% of the conventionally treated wastewater directly to the dam. In week 50/51, the concentration of suspended solids in the conventionally treated wastewater was 13 mg SS/L, which was 60% higher than in samples from week 49 and week 50 that contained 8 mg SS/L. This might have allowed some of these viruses to escape the ozone treatment and to reappear in the dams. Additional explanations could be that our attempts to follow the \u201csame\u201d water based on the flow through the treatment plant had been disrupted and that the waters analyzed from the outlet of the dams were not the same as the ozonized waters. Another reason might be that the viruses were present in amounts too low to be detected in the ozonized water by qPCR. Larger amounts of water might be needed to determine if these viruses were also present in the waters after ozone treatment, and further studies are also needed to determine the impact of the ozone treatment on these viruses.",

In clean water, human mastadenovirus F40 (HAdV-F40) has been shown to be more resistant to ozone treatment than feline calicivirus, which is often used as a surrogate for noroviruses (Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2005). In the present study, the dominant strains of adenovirus varied, both between the differently treated waters and within the sample groups. There were different HAdV-F40 and HAdV-F41 strains in all inlet sewage samples, while in one ozone-treated sample a divergent type F strain dominated and in some of the treated waters there were type A strains. A somewhat similar finding was also obtained by Fernandez-Cassi and co-workers (Fernandez-Cassi et al., 2017). The pattern observed in this study suggests that there was a complex composition comprising multiple adenovirus types in the raw sewage, and these might have varying degrees of sensitivity to the conventional processing and ozone treatment. However, we do not know if these viruses are viable after the ozone treatment, and the oxidization might have changed the conformation of the viral head protein and thereby inhibited viral-host binding (Shannon et al., 2008). Because the amount of viral genomes decreased significantly after the ozonation, the treatment might not only change the conformation of the viral capsids, but might also destroy or open the capsid of some viruses and thereby release the viral genomes into the water where nucleases are present. Further studies are needed on ozonation of water containing adenovirus types that are easy to isolate on cell cultures in order to identify the viability of the viruses after treatment.",

The identified viruses could infect bacteria, plants, vertebrates, invertebrates, and protists, with bacteriophages contributing the largest proportion. The bacteriophage gokushovirus, which primarily targets Chlamydia, Bdellovibrio, and Spiroplasma (Labonte et al., 2015), accounted for most viral reads in all samples. This virus has been shown to be widespread in global environmental samples, especially in aquatic ecosystems (Hopkins et al., 2014; Labonte et al., 2015), and can be used as a potential viral indicator for treatment efficacy in different waters. Human disease-related viruses, which can cause diarrhea, respiratory diseases, conjunctivitis, meningoencephalitis, and infantile gastroenteritis (Fong et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2007) were also identified. Some of these that might cause gastroenteritis, such as human picobirnavirus and human feces pecovirus (Giordano et al., 1999; Phan et al., 2016; Phan et al., 2012), were widely detected in the sewage samples but are usually not tested for at hospital laboratories. To understand their importance for public health, more enteric viruses identified in environmental samples should be incorporated into the routine monitoring of patients with gastroenteritis.",

Other recent studies have also identified multiple types of HPV, including the oncogenic high-risk HPV16, in raw sewage (Bibby and Peccia, 2013; Cantalupo et al., 2011; La Rosa et al., 2013). The presence of this virus in large amounts in aquatic environments has caused concern about its potential for waterborne transmissions, which might cause anogenic or oral HPV infections even among people who have not been sexually active (Fratini et al., 2014); however, further research into its transmission by the waterborne route is still needed.",

This might be due to their low quantity in sewage. Most of the viruses detected by NGS had about one to two log10 higher viral genome concentrations than the overlooked viruses, indicating that NGS has some limitations when dealing with complex environmental samples and might underestimate the number of different viruses if the number reads are not high enough to exhaustively probe the sample. The concentration efficiency of about 10% used in this study might also have influenced the amount of viruses identified. However, this efficiency is comparable to that obtained by other concentration methods (Cashdollar et al., 2013; Fout et al., 2015; Hellmer et al., 2014; Ikner et al., 2011). By using adsorption to charged filters, HAdV-2, which was used for the evaluation of this technique, has previously been used in another study with a recovery of about 14%, while the recovery was 77% to 83% for enteroviruses (Ikner et al., 2011). The low recovery of adenovirus might be due to its surface capsid structure and electrostatic charge, which might facilitate the entrapment of these viruses in the charged filters and hamper their elution from the filters (Gibbons et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2016). HAdv-2 was used in this study as an indicator of the effectiveness of the method because it could easily be detected by both qPCR and isolation on cell cultures and was shown to be viable in all concentration steps used. This method might therefore have a higher concentration efficiency for other viruses than adenovirus and thus should also be analyzed for other viruses that can be isolated on cell culture.",

The ability of ozonation to reduce the transmission risks of human pathogens might therefore be considered when decisions are taken as to whether it is worthwhile to install advanced sewage treatments to remove microcontaminants and bacterial pathogens. It should be acknowledged that in addition to the apparent advantages, ozonation also come with a cost, and high ozone doses in particular can sometimes lead to the formation of compounds that can negatively affect aquatic life (Samuelsson et al., 2011). Further studies are needed to determine the most efficient methods, including different ozonation procedures, for viral elimination in sewage and whether these pathogens in treated waters are viable and can spread. The elimination of human pathogens is imperative in order to prevent waterborne viruses from re-entering into the environment and thus reduce the potential risk they pose to public health.",
