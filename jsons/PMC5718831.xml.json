Vaccine manufacturers must choose their targets carefully because the cost of development for a single vaccine ranges between half a billion and a billion dollars,4 to which must be added the construction costs for a manufacturing facility. Much of this cost relates to the phase III trial that is normally necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy in comparison to a placebo, and which allows licensure. Licensing authorities in the United States and Europe place a high bar of safety and efficacy for licensure. This is not a criticism, because the public demands that a product used in healthy people to avoid possible infection be free of serious side effects and also highly effective.",

Of course, epidemiology might change in the interval between a commitment and licensure, as it did for Group B meningococcus,6 in which case there is no mechanism for the manufacturer to be recompensed for the costs of development.",

There is a growing vaccine industry in China, Brazil, and India, as well as many smaller national companies, but by and large they do not spend large amounts of money on research vaccines.

The basic idea of CEPI is that when there is a perception that the commercial market is insufficient to justify private investment in vaccine development against an emerging pathogen, that manufacturers be reimbursed for the production of candidates that can be taken through phases 1 and 2 to provide initial evidence for safety and efficacy, followed by the production and maintenance of a stockpile for emergency use [Table 2]. Inherent in this concept is that applicants must have a means of producing the candidate under Good Manufacturing Practice. In situations where a phase III trial is feasible owing to continued incidence of infection it would be done, although identification of a correlate of protection might be sufficient for confidence that the particular vaccine could be deployed in the event of an outbreak. Licensure might be obtained eventually if efficacy is confirmed in a phase III trial or if that is not feasible, by showing protection in 2 relevant animal models.\n\n\n",

Another defect is that they focus on infections that are or have been epidemic, excluding those that are endemic but not yet prevented by vaccination.\n\n",

Chikungunya has spread from Africa to around the world, including to the Western Hemisphere in 2013, and in the process picked up a mutation that allows it to infect Aedes albopictus as well as Aedes aegypti.38 It is far from benign, causing residual arthralgia in about half of those infected and a chronic rheumatoid arthritis-like syndrome in 5%.39,40 Among the factors that make vaccine development relatively easy is the fact that Chikungunya is an \u03b1virus with a genome that synthesizes envelope proteins against which antibodies are typically effective.41 Although there are multiple lineages of the virus, depending on geography, there is only one serotype.

The divergence of the West African virus from the Central African virus occurred about 2004, presumably in the primate population. The closest virus sequence to that found in the West African epidemic from a human case was that from the 2007 epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 7 y before the human epidemic in Guinea started in 2014.58 Rapid accumulation of genetic variation was seen in the Ebola virus genomes.

Such surveillance could be undertaken by WHO based on electronic reporting from around the world. If such surveillance could be organized, then CEPI could establish a DNA plasmid library of those agents, which would enable rapid development of at least DNA vaccines and rapid translation to other types of vaccine platforms. As a result there would be less chance of being surprised by a large outbreak of an unknown agent, and a faster development of candidate vaccines against such an agent.",

The lists that CEPI, WHO and other organizations began with were limited to diseases already known to be threats to human health. If we use more of the tools of modern biology those lists could be expanded to include other agents and therefore to justify the extension of CEPI over the long-term future to act as a worldwide safeguard against an unanticipated epidemic of an agent not yet well known.
