The lipid bilayer is derived from host cell membranes during the process of virus assembly and budding. Consequently, infection of host cells requires that enveloped viruses fuse their membrane with cellular membranes to release the nucleocapsid and accessory proteins into the host cell in order to establish a new infectious cycle. Glycoproteins from enveloped viruses evolved to combine two main features. Firstly, they contain a receptor-binding function, which attaches the virus to the host cell. Secondly, they include a fusion protein function that can be activated to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Both tasks can be encoded by a single glycoprotein or by separate glycoproteins, which act in concert.",

According to this view, fusion of two lipid bilayers in an aqueous environment requires that they come into close contact associated with a significant energy barrier. This process involves local membrane bending creating a first site of contact. Complete dehydration of the initial contact site induces monolayer rupture that allows mixing of lipids from the two outer leaflets, resulting in a hemifusion stalk. In a next step, the model predicts that radial expansion of the stalk leads to either direct fusion pore opening or to the formation of another intermediate, the hemifusion diaphragm, an extended bilayer connecting both membranes. The hemifusion diaphragm may also expand into a fusion pore. Fusion pore formation, which is characterized by an initial opening and closing (\u2018flickering\u2019) of the pore may be mediated by several factors such as lateral tension in the hemifusion stalk or bilayer and the curvature at the edges of the hemifusion state. Finally the fusion pore extends laterally until both membranes form a new extended lipid bilayer (Figure 1\n).",

Labeling techniques allow to distinguish between merging of lipid bilayers and content mixing thus visualizing intermediate steps in membrane fusion. This has been applied to several liposome fusion systems demonstrating that membrane fusion steps can be arrested at different stages. Furthermore, certain lipids such as inverted cone-shaped lysophospholipids induce spontaneous positive bilayer curvature and inhibit hemifusion, while cone-shaped phosphatidylethanolamines induce negative curvature and promote hemifusion. In contrast, the lipid effect on the opening of the fusion pore is the opposite.

The endoproteolytic cleavage positions a hydrophobic fusion peptide at or close to the N-terminus of the fusion domain. Subtilisin-like proteases recognize a conserved multibasic recognition sequence R-X-K/R-R or a monobasic cleavage site present in various glycoproteins. The nature of the cleavage site and its efficient cleavage (e.g., influenza virus hemagglutinin) has been associated with pathogenicity. The multibasic recognition sequences present in influenza virus HA, SV5 F protein, HIV-1 gp160, and Ebola virus GP lead to mostly intracellular processing, whereas monobasic cleavage sites in Sendai virus F protein or influenza virus HA are efficiently cleaved extracellularly, resulting in a more tissue-restricted distribution of these viruses.",

(2) Another dramatic change occurs toward the end of the central triple-stranded coiled-coil, where a short fragment unfolds to form a reverse turn which positions a short helix antiparallel against the central core.

Secondly, they all contain a central triple-stranded coiled-coil region with outer C-terminal antiparallel layers that are either mostly helical or adopt extended conformations, thus forming trimers of helical hairpins. Since they resemble the low pH form of HA, it is assumed that they all represent the postfusion conformation.

            "text": "The positioning of the N- and C-terminal ends containing the fusion peptide and the transmembrane region at the same end of a core structure, which was first established for the HIV-1 gp41 core structure, led to the proposal of the following general fusion model. (1) Proteolytic cleavage activation transforms the glycoprotein into a metastable conformation. (2) Receptor binding induces conformational changes in the fusion protein that exposes the fusion peptide and allows fusion peptide interactions with the target membrane (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)\n). This generates a prehairpin intermediate structure that can be targeted by fusion inhibitors such as the HIV-1-specific T-20 peptide (Figure 5(b)). (3) Extensive refolding of the fusion domain most likely requires the dissociation of the C-terminal regions (Figures 5(b) and 5(c), indicated by blue lines) and leads to the apposition of the two membranes, concomitantly with the zipping up of the C-terminal region against the N-terminal coiled-coil domain ultimately forming the hairpin structure (Figures 5(c) and 5(d)). The complete refolding process is thought to pull the two membranes into close-enough proximity to concomitantly allow membrane fusion. The extensive rearrangement of the fusion protein is thought to control the formation of different intermediate bilayer structures such as the hemifusion stalk (Figure 5(d)), and or the hemifusion diaphragm, followed by fusion pore opening and expansion (Figure 5(e)). It is generally assumed that membrane fusion occurs while the helical hairpin structure is formed and the core fusion protein structures represent postfusion conformations. Refolding of the fusion protein might produce defined stable intermediate structures, as suggested by the two low pH structures of influenza virus HA2. One indicates that most of the outer layer has not yet zipped up to form the hairpin structure (Figure 3, middle panel: the C-terminal ends could extend back to the transmembrane region), while the other one reveals the extended conformation of the outer layer which forms together with the N-terminal coiled-coil a stable N-capped structure (Figure 3, right panel). Stepwise refolding may thus lock the fusion process irreversibly at distinct steps in agreement with a general irreversibility of class I-mediated fusion processes. The two membrane anchors, which are not present in the fusion conformation structures, also play an active role in the fusion reaction. Replacement of the transmembrane region by a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor leads to a hemifusion phenotype in case of hemagglutinin-driven membrane fusion, highlighting the role of the transmembrane region. Furthermore the C-terminal membrane proximal region plays an important role in fusion as shown in the case of HIV-1 gp41-mediated fusion.",

NMR studies on the isolated influenza virus hemagglutinin fusion peptide revealed a kinked helical arrangement, which was suggested to insert into one lipid bilayer leaflet. This mode of bilayer interaction was proposed not only to mediate membrane attachment but also to destabilize the lipid bilayer.

Since the fusion activity of viral glycoproteins such as HIV-1 Env is affected by cellular receptor density as well as Env glycoprotein density, it has been suggested that both ligands have to be clustered efficiently to cooperatively trigger productive Env-mediated membrane fusion.

Flaviviruses express the glycoprotein E that associates with a second precursor glycoprotein prM, while alphaviruses express two glycoproteins, the fusion protein El and the receptor-binding protein E2. E1 associates with the regulatory precursor protein p62. Both E-prM and E1-p62 heterodimerization are important for folding and transport of the fusion proteins. Cleavage of the fusion protein chaperones p62 and prM by the cellular protease furin in the secretory pathway is a crucial step in the activation of E and E1 fusion proteins.",

Domain II harbors the fusion loop that is stabilized by a disulfide bridge and mostly sequestered within the antiparallel flavivirus E glycoprotein homodimer. In analogy, the fusion loop might be sequestered within the SFV E1\u2013E2 heterodimer. Dimeric E\u2013E and E1\u2013E2 interactions keep the glycoproteins in an inactive, membrane-parallel conformation that covers the viral membrane. SFV E1\u2013E2 heterodimers form an icosahedral scaffold with T\n = 4 symmetry. Similarly, flavivirus E homodimers completely cover the viral membrane surface. The arrangement of the class II glycoproteins is thus completely different from the appearance of class I glycoprotein spikes, which do not form a specific symmetrical protein coat. In addition to forming the outer protein shell, flavivirus E and alphavirus E2 interact with cellular receptors, which direct the virion to the endocytotic pathway.",

One significant difference between the TBE E and SFV E1 low pH conformations are the orientations of the fusion loops. TBE E fusion loops undergo homotrimer interactions, while SFV E1 fusion loops do not interact within trimers (Figure 6).",

Firstly, the homo- or heterodimers dissociate from the membrane-parallel conformation in a reversible manner assuming monomeric fusion proteins that expose their fusion loop to the target membrane (Figures 7(a) and 7(a\u2032)\n). This seems to be a main difference between class I and class II fusion, since trimer dissociation into monomers has not been implicated in any class I fusion pathway. Secondly, fusion loop membrane interaction leads to the formation of homotrimers with an extended conformation. Trimerization is irreversible and tethers the fusion protein to the target membrane (Figure 7(b)). It is comparable to the postulated prehairpin structure of class I fusion proteins such as HIV-1 gp41 (Figure 7(b)). Notably, both fusion intermediates can be targeted by either fusion protein peptides (T-20 in case of HIV-1 gp41) or recombinant fusion protein domains (such as the E3 domain in case of TBE), to block membrane fusion. Further refolding, namely the reorientation of domain I, then pulls the two membranes into closer apposition that ultimately leads to the formation of a hemifusion stalk-like structure (Figures 7(c) and 7(d)). Finally complete zipping up of the C-terminal ends against the N-terminal core domains allows fusion pore opening and its expansion (Figure 7(e)). Similar to the case of class I fusion protein-driven fusion, refolding is thought to provide the energy for fusion (Figure 7).",

The low-pH structures indicate that only hydrophobic side chains of the loop insert into the hydrocarbon chains of the outer leaflet of a target membrane. This is sufficient to anchor the fusion protein to the host cell membrane. Further oligomerization of fusion loops, as shown in the case of the low pH form of SFV E1, where crystal packing analysis revealed fusion loop interactions between trimers, was suggested to induce local membrane deformation, such as induction of a nipple-like membrane deformation (Figure 7(c)). This has been predicted in the stalk model to play an important role in the generation of lipidic intermediates during membrane fusion. Therefore the SFV E1 conformation might reflect an intermediate fusion state preceding the suggested postfusion conformation of flavivirus E trimers with homotrimeric fusion loop interactions. In vivo, the latter conformation might be induced by the final refolding of the C-terminal membrane proximal region and thus determining \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 conformations of SFV E1 trimers and TBE virus E trimers, respectively (Figure 6).",

The E protein lattice on liposomes contains preferentially rings of five, which seems to affect the curvature of coated liposomes. In contrast rings of six form mostly flat hexagonal arrays in vitro.
