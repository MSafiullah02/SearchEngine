Moreover, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 differ from TLR4 in two particularly important ways for antiviral immunity: they can be activated by nucleic acid agonists mimicking compounds produced during the viral cycle, and they are typically present within the cell, along the endocytic pathway, where they sense viral products in the intraluminal space. Investigations in mice have demonstrated that the TLR7/9-IFN and TLR3-IFN pathways are different and critical for protective immunity to various experimental viral infections. Investigations in humans with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) deficiency (unresponsive to TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9), UNC-93B deficiency (unresponsive to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9), and TLR3 deficiency have recently shed light on the role of these two pathways in antiviral immunity in natural conditions. UNC-93B-and TLR3-deficient patients appear to be specifically prone to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis, although clinical penetrance is incomplete, whereas IRAK-4-deficient patients appear to be normally resistant to most viruses, including HSV-1. These experiments of nature suggest that the TLR7-, TLR8-, and TLR9-dependent induction of IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFN-l is largely redundant in human antiviral immunity, whereas the TLR3-dependent induction of IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFN-l is critical for primary immunity to HSV-1 in the central nervous system in children but redundant for immunity to most other viral infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The first demonstration of Toll involvement in host immunity was provided in 1996 by the observation that Toll-deficient Drosophila are vulnerable to experimental infection with certain fungi (1) .

This classical pathway leads to the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) (10) (11) (12) . The alternative MyD88-independent pathway (Fig. 1) , also referred to as the TRIF-dependent pathway, results in the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) via two kinases, the inhibitor of NF-kB kinase e (IKK-e) and TANK (TRAF family member-associated NF-kB activator)-binding kinase-1 (TBK-1). The MyD88-independent pathway leads to the transcription of a smaller number of genes, including IFN genes, such as that encoding IFN-b (10) (11) (12) and possibly also the IFN-l gene (27) .

An overview of the signaling pathways triggered by the interferon (IFN)-inducing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9) and human primary immunodeficiencies involving TLR-signaling pathways. Five TLRs (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) have been shown to induce the production of IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFN-l. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 trigger the 'classical' MyD88-dependent TLR pathway, via the TIR-containing cytosolic adapter MyD88. TLR3 triggers the 'alternative' MyD88-independent, TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-b (TRIF)dependent pathway via the TRIF. TLR4 triggers the MyD88-dependent TLR pathway, via the TIRAP-MyD88 interaction, and triggers the MyD88independent pathway, via the TRIF-related adapter molecule(TRAM)-TRIF interaction. The MyD88-dependent pathway results in the activation of both nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), via the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) complex, which comprises two active kinases (IRAK-1 and IRAK-4) and two non-catalytic subunits (IRAK-2 and IRAK-M). The MyD88-independent pathway results in the activation of IRF3 via two kinases: NF-kB kinase e (IKK-e) and TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK-1). TRAF family member-associated NF-kB activator (TANK) interacts with NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO), TBK1, and IRF3 and may therefore liaise between the MyD88-dependent and MyD88independent pathways. These signaling pathways triggered by TLRs have been dissected in mice and, to a lesser extent, in humans. The three proteins in the TLR signaling pathways (IRAK-4, UNC-93B, and TLR3) responsible for the human primary immunodeficiencies discussed in this review are shown in red, the other two proteins in the TLR signaling pathways (NEMO, IkBa) responsible for human primary immunodeficiencies not discussed here are shown in blue.

Although the NEMO-TANK interaction seems to bridge the IRF3 and NF-kB signaling pathways downstream from TLRs (35) , the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying these two pathways remain unclear.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 468, "end": 472, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 478, "end": 482, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 922, "end": 926, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 927, "end": 931, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 932, "end": 936, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 970, "end": 974, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1048, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1060, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1076, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1077, "end": 1081, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1086, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3326, "end": 3330, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3331, "end": 3335, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3336, "end": 3340, "text": "(34)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3341, "end": 3345, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3346, "end": 3350, "text": "(36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3426, "end": 3430, "text": "(37)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3440, "end": 3444, "text": "(38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3445, "end": 3448, "text": "39)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 3499, "end": 3503, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3504, "end": 3508, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3509, "end": 3513, "text": "(34)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3514, "end": 3518, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3519, "end": 3523, "text": "(36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3636, "end": 3640, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 40, "end": 46, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 527, "end": 535, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1237, "end": 1243, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The TLR pathways leading to the production of IFN-a/-b and IFN-l have begun to be unraveled in recent years (11, 12, 40) .

Four of these TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) are intracellular in most cell types tested. They are found along the secretory and endocytic pathways and can be stimulated by nucleic acid agonists mimicking those produced during viral infections. TLR3 can be activated by doublestranded RNA (41); TLR7 and TLR8 (in humans only) can be activated by antiviral derivatives of nucleoside-like imidazoquinoline (42, 43) and loxoribine (44) and GU-rich single-stranded (ss) RNAs (45) (46) (47) . TLR9 can be activated by non-methylated double-stranded (ds) CpG-rich DNA (48, 49) . Cell surface-expressed human TLR4 can be stimulated by LPS and, possibly, by some viral proteins, but it is a much less potent inducer of IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFN-l (50-52).

Mouse IRAK-4 is 87% similar and 84% identical to human IRAK-4 (70) . Like Pelle and the other members of the IRAK family, IRAK-4 contains an N-terminal death domain (DD) and a central kinase domain (KD) (71) . The crystal structures of the IRAK-4 DD and KD domains have recently been obtained for mice and humans, revealing structures in these domains of IRAK-4 very different from those of Pelle and other members of the IRAK family (73, 74) . IRAK-4 acts as a kinase downstream from MyD88 and upstream from IRAK-1 and TRAF-6 (72). IRAK-4-deficient mouse cells displayed strongly impaired IL-1R and TLR signaling, and the activation of NF-kB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK induced by IL-1 and multiple TLR agonists, including TLR7 and TLR9 agonists and the nonspecific TLR3 agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], was profoundly inhibited in IRAK-4-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and macrophages (71) . Knockin mice with an inactivated IRAK-4 kinase were recently produced. In these mice, TLR7-and TLR9-mediated signaling is abolished in bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). The TLR7-and TLR9induced production of IFN-a and IFN-b was abolished in pDCs isolated from these mice, and the production of IFN-l was not determined. However, TLR3-mediated signaling was intact in myeloid DCs (mDCs) from IRAK-4-deficient and IRAK-4kinase-inactive knockin mice (75) .

However, the broader impairment of immunity in these mice, affecting multiple TLR and IL-1R responses, makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions as to whether the susceptibility of these mice to viruses results from the impairment of TLR7-and TLR9mediated induction of IFNs. Human IRAK-4 deficiency was first reported in 2003, in three children with pyogenic bacterial diseases (67) . Up to 28 such patients have since been reported (85) . IRAK-4-deficient cells from these patients, including whole blood cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), individual myeloid and lymphoid leukocyte subsets, and skin-derived fibroblasts, displayed impaired response to IL-1 and the TLR agonists tested, with the exception of TLR3 responses and TLR4-mediated IFN-a, -b, and -l responses (85, 86) (Fig. 2) . In particular, the induction of IFN-a, -b, and -l in response to the stimulation of TLR7, TLR8, or TLR9 was found to be completely abolished in IRAK4-deficient PBMCs (Fig. 2) .

None of the known 28 IRAK-4deficient patients suffered from severe viral disease, although at least 20 common viruses have a high prevalence among Four of the five IFN-inducing TLRs (TLR3,  TLR7 , TLR8, and TLR9) are intracellular in most cell types tested. Viral nucleic acids, including double stranded (ds) RNA, single stranded (ss) RNA, and DNA, produced during virus replication are thought to be detected by TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9, respectively, and to induce IFN production. The production of IFN-a, -b, and -l in response to TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 stimulation is impaired in interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-4-deficient patients, who appear to be resistant to most viruses. The induction of IFN-a, -b, and -l by TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 is impaired in UNC-93B-deficient patients, who are prone to herpes simplex virus 1 encephalitis (HSE) but appear to be resistant to most viruses. The UNC-93B-TLR3-IFN-a, -b, and -l pathway is presumably essential for primary immunity to HSV-1 in the central nervous system (CNS) in children but is redundant for immunity to most other viral infections.

The 3d mouse also has a defect in exogenous antigen processing, as conventional major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) presentation and cross-presentation by class I MHC (MHC-I) are impaired. The impairment of crosspresentation, to some extent, may reflect impaired IFN-a/b production (94) . 3d mice are highly susceptible to MCMV, which was used to identify 3d mutant mice generated by random mutagenesis (56) . These mice are also susceptible to the Gram-positive extracellular bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-positive intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. The particular susceptibility of 3d mice to MCMV may be accounted for by the impaired activation of TLR3 and TLR9, as mutations affecting signaling via the TLR3 and TLR9 pathways have also been shown to increase susceptibility to MCMV in C57BL/6 mice, which normally show robust resistance to MCMV (5) ( Table 2 ). 3d mice have yet to be challenged with other viruses. In humans, homozygous germline mutations in UNC93B1 were reported in 2006, in two unrelated patients who suffered from HSE, from different consanguineous kindreds (68) . The identification of human UNC-93B deficiency provided the first genetic etiology of HSE, the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in Western countries, caused by the almost ubiquitous and typically innocuous virus HSV-1 (95) . The identification of human UNC-93B deficiency also provided the first evidence that HSE can result from a monogenic trait.

Unlike Stat-1 (96) (97) (98) and Tyk-2 (99) deficiencies, which affect most cells and confer predisposition to multiple viral diseases, human UNC-93B deficiency seems to confer a relatively narrow predisposition to viruses, so far limited to HSE.

Moreover, HSE patients are typically resistant to other infections, both before and after HSE, as serological tests have shown these patients to have been exposed to many other viruses, with no severe clinical manifestations (68, 69) ( Table  3 ).

TLR3-deficient mice are also susceptible to MCMV in some experimental conditions, as shown by the impaired production of cytokines, including IFN-a and -b in vivo, higher viral load in the spleen, and lower survival rate of TLR3deficient mice than that of WT mice (5) . TLR3-deficient mice are also susceptible to RSV infection, but to a lesser extent (124) . Remarkably, TLR3-deficient mice appear to be more resistant to other infections than WT mice ( Table 1) . Following infection with influenza A virus (IAV) (125), Punta Toro virus (PTV) (126) , or West Nile virus (WNV) (127), TLR3deficient mice produce smaller amounts of inflammatory mediators, such as IFN-a and -b, than WT mice, but had a higher survival rate. TLR3-deficient mice did not differ from controls in their ability to generate both CD8 1 T and CD4 1 T IFN-g responses to LCMV, VSV, and MCMV; they were also similar to WT mice in terms of T3 reovirus-induced injury in the CNS (128) . Most studies have reported low levels of induction of cytokines or IFN in TLR3-deficient mice, suggesting that TLR3 is involved in the balance of inflammatory mediators.

In these two children, from non-consanguineous families, a heterozygous 1660C 4 T mutation (P554S) was found in TLR3 (69) . There was no founder gene effect, as the two 1660C 4 T mutations were in different TLR3 haplotypes. The 1660C 4 T mutant allele is dominant negative for the response to poly(I:C) in fibroblasts, in terms of IFN-b and -l induction. Fibroblasts, monocytedifferentiated DCs, NK cells, and CD8 1 T cells from the patients displayed an impaired response to poly(I:C). A defect in the production of IFN-b and -l by fibroblasts stimulated with HSV-1, VSV, and poly(I:C) has been observed in TLR3 heterozygous fibroblasts, like in UNC93B-deficient fibroblasts. Higher virus titers and enhanced cell mortality upon HSV-1 and VSV infection were observed in both TLR3 heterozygous fibroblasts and UNC93B-deficient fibroblasts complemented with IFN-a and -b and, less efficiently, IFN-l. Impaired TLR3 signaling thus results in abnormally weak IFN-a, -b, and -l production, enhanced viral replication, and enhanced cell death in fibroblasts. By inference, this is a plausible pathogenesis of HSE in the CNS.

Nonetheless, clinical penetrance is incomplete, as five of the seven TLR3deficient individuals and one of the three UNC-93B-deficient individuals did not develop HSE despite HSV-1 infection (69) . Interestingly, UNC-93B and TLR3 deficiencies seem to confer predisposition to HSE alone, as the patients do not suffer from other viral diseases ( Table 3 ) or from HSV-1 infections outside the CNS (69) . TLR3-independent IFN responses to dsRNA, even in some cells and tissues that express TLR3, may confer protection against a wide range of viruses in TLR3-and UNC-93B-deficient patients (54) . We have shown that mDCs and keratinocytes (which normally express TLR3) and pDCs (which do not normally express TLR3) produce IFN-a, -b, and -l in response to poly(I:C), in a TLR3-independent manner. The IFN response to viruses other than VSV and HSV-1 also is strong in TLR3heterozygous and UNC-93B-deficient fibroblasts. Moreover, the production of IFN-a, -b, and -l has been shown to be normal in PBMCs from TLR3-deficient patients, following stimulation with the viruses tested (69) .

This finding by no means suggests that these pathways are not involved in antiviral immunity; they may be, although in a redundant manner. Similarly, the IRAK-4-independent, UNC-93B-dependent, TLR3-mediated induction of IFN-a, -b, and -l is redundant for protective immunity to most viruses. Nonetheless, this pathway seems to be selectively critical for protective immunity to HSV-1 in the CNS upon primary HSV-1 infection, in at least some children (Fig. 2) . It is remarkable that HSV-1 does not spread via the epithelia or bloodstream in patients with no functional TLR3 or UNC-93B. It would be interesting to challenge TLR3-and UNC-93B-deficient mice with HSV-1. The considerable redundancy observed in humans contrasts with the findings of many studies in mice showing that both the TLR7/8/9-UNC-93B-MyD88-IRAK-4-IFN pathway and the TLR3-UNC-93B-TRIF-IFN pathway protect against experimental viral infections. Data for humans are more consistent with these pathways having a redundant effect on immunity to most viruses, and it may even well be that UNC-93B-and TLR3-deficient patients are more resistant to some viruses than the general population.

Other viral sensors, such as the IFN-inducing cytoplasmic dsDNA sensor (135) (136) (137) , have also been identified and may also be involved in antiviral immunity. We aim to evaluate the involvement of these molecules in natural antiviral immunity, by searching for germline mutations in the genes encoding these molecules, in patients with unexplained viral diseases.
