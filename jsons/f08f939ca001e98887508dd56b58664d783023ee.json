The most commonly isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Moraxella catarrhalis (9.4%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.1%).

Chlamydia trachomatis (C trachomatis) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N gonorrhoeae) are the most significant bacterial pathogens to be diagnosed in infectious neonatal conjunctivitis, because without treatment they can both lead to serious long-term consequences (8) . C trachomatis is considered a major causative agent for neonatal conjunctivitis in many centres (9) (10) (11) , but its proportion varies greatly between geographical regions and clinical settings, ranging from 0 to 64% (1) (2) (3) (4) 6, (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .

The research plan was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of the Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District, Oulu, Finland (EETTMK 43/2010). More than 99% of the children in Finland attend child welfare clinics for regular health examinations, so that it may be said that these clinics assess the physical, mental and social growth and development of all children from newborn infants to seven years of age (20) . A public health nurse makes a postpartum home visit one to two weeks after birth, and the first follow-up appointment at a child welfare clinic is at the age of one month.",

Conjunctival specimens were collected from the actual site of infection and from both eyes in cases of bilateral conjunctivitis. First, the area around the affected eye was gently cleansed to remove discharge, after which the culture was obtained by swabbing the mucosal area of the lower eyelid. Second, the inner surface of the lower eyelid was swabbed thoroughly two to three times to collect epithelial cells for nucleic acid amplification testing. The swabs were stored and transported at room temperature to the clinical microbiological laboratory at Oulu University Hospital (NordLab, Oulu, Finland) on the same day. Sheep blood agars at a concentration of 5% and chocolate agars were used to culture the bacteria. A multiplex real-time PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, influenza viruses A and B, coronaviruses 229E, NL63 and OC43, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B and rhinovirus.

Sandstr\u20ac om et al. and Rapoza et al. reported only one case of viral neonatal conjunctivitis each (1/100 and 1/55), the causative agents being Coxsackie virus A9 and Herpes simplex virus type 1 (11, 14) . Both studies originate from the 1980s, when the current novel multiplex PCR methods for detecting common respiratory viruses were not yet available. The Red Book, 2015 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, American Academy of Pediatrics, does not mention common respiratory viruses as causative agents for neonatal conjunctivitis (24) ; however, such viruses were found in 5% of our neonates with clinical conjunctivitis when using modern multiplex PCR methods, thus providing support that a viral aetiology should also be considered during the neonatal period. Altogether two neonates with viral conjunctivitis had a concurrent bacterial pathogen in their conjunctival specimens, but even after excluding these cases, the proportion of viral conjunctivitis remained at 4%. Mucopurulent discharge, conjunctival redness and swollen eyelids have been observed as distinctive symptoms of chlamydial conjunctivitis (10, 12, 26) . Chang et al. reported that 32% of the infants in their patient series who were suffering from vertically transmitted chlamydial conjunctivitis had blood-stained discharge from the infected eyes (27) . We showed in a previous register-based nationwide study in Finland that vertically transmitted C trachomatis infections in children were rare (28) , and we thus assumed that C trachomatis infections may be underdiagnosed in the neonatal period. In the present study, however, it transpired that C trachomatis was not diagnosed in any of the 163 consecutive neonates with clinical conjunctivitis in a population-based setting. Furthermore, the majority of the present neonates had mild conjunctivitis characterised only by mucopurulent discharge without any other signs of infection, and none of them had blood-stained ocular discharge. Our findings thus indicate that routine testing for C trachomatis in an uncomplicated neonatal conjunctivitis in primary care is unnecessary unless the symptoms are severe or prolonged.",
