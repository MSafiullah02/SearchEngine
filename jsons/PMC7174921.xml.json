            "text": "In Canada, the growing number of newcomer families underscores the need for effective pedagogical support in an evolving global landscape (Cheng et al. 2009). There exists a new reality of language learning needs based on the influx of newcomer students in Canada using technology for the acquisition of twenty-first century literacy skills. These skills include creativity and innovation, communication, critical thinking and problem solving, and collaboration (National Education Association 2002). Often, educators are challenged to support the parents and families with literacy-rich activities that best address the multimodal learning skills of twenty-first century ELL students. Moreover, a recent survey of newcomer parents in Canada also suggests that they have apprehensions about engaging with the school community and feel disconnected from other parents (Xuemei et al. 2016). To add to these challenges, the digital divide persists along racial and class lines (Machado-Casas et al. 2014). In this article, we not only nuance the catch-all notion of \u2018twenty-first century learning skills\u2019 through glimpses of 40 families\u2019 experiences of digital literacies, but also we expose some of the more invisible aspects of digital divides in suburban communities.",

It was found that in all countries that there was a correlation between the school\u2019s low SES and low computer information literacy; however, this effect did not exist on an individual basis such that high SES students are not advantaged compared to low SES students in the same schools. Still, there is a divide between students in low and high SES homes in the type of device used. These findings signal part of the picture of disparities across communities to \u2018twenty-first century learning.\u2019",

In keeping with this notion, there are recent examples of family digital literacy programs that enhance the literacy skills of the children and the digital literacy of their parents (e.g., Lee et al. 2018). Noguer\u00f3n-Liu (2017a, 2017b) examined the digital access, use, and beliefs of immigrant parents whose children had access to devices at school and the parents themselves who engaged in technology support workshops. Parents from similar cultural backgrounds used technology in similar ways and other demographic factors such as SES, employment, education influenced parents\u2019 beliefs about device usage and access. Such findings highlight strong connections between what Dolan (2016) calls the cans and cannots when it comes to digital literacy skills. That is, if you have the best devices, strong wifi connections, access to software, and importantly, the meta-knowledge about how to engage and leverage these communicational systems, students from higher SES backgrounds have an advantage within formal education (Rowsell et al. 2017). So it is with these more lived realities of disparities and types of twenty-first century skills that have currency in formal education versus more informal and vernacular ones that we base our definition of twenty-first century learning.",

Davidson (2012) found that through discussion, children\u2019s research for a project became a topic of social conversation stemming from the images and videos found. Davidson also discovered that children had to make meaning of the verbal instructions given to them by parents or teachers, and translate those instructions into action using their devices. This process of meaning-making through digital literacies becomes a key aspect of childrens\u2019 multimedia use and learning and if parents, especially newcomer parents, are not familiar with these interactions, the children may not develop the adept ability to navigate their devices for learning.",

However, children who are exposed to a positive relationship between technology and their parents, are likely to develop higher personal autonomy while monitoring or moderating their uses of technology when not monitored by their parents in adolescence. Those adolescents also make digital choices that would be deemed as acceptable by the parents (Davies 2011). Davies also mentions that parents are often anxious about their children\u2019s technology use, especially for social purposes, but tend to see the value of some technology for educational purposes. Livingstone and Helsper (2008) support Davies\u2019 statements explaining that \u201cparents seem engaged in a constant battle with their children as they seek to balance the educational and social advantages of media use and the negative effects that some content... might have on children\u2019s attitudes, behaviour, or safety\u201d (p. 581). The development of a child\u2019s skill-set, information base, and familiarity with technology may stem from the strength of parental interaction, guidance, and mediation.",

Specifically, Hamlin and Flessa discovered that large urban areas need more multilingual support for culturally diverse parents and stronger parental supports for safety while using technology (while parents monitor their children). In Ontario, Canada, the government proposed a Parents Reaching Out Grant Program to aid in parental participation in the many contexts of their children\u2019s lives, including the school community. Recently, 11% of all province-wide initiatives were focused on developing culturally diverse parents\u2019 connections with the school and their children\u2019s learning via technology or other communication systems (Hamlin and Flessa 2018).",

This project explored how schools partner with a local university to use digital resources as tools to co-create learning with newcomer parents in their community. The school community includes a number of parents who are educated immigrants (non-English first language), of a visible minority, but unemployed and low income.

As a whole, this project sought to explore ways for parents to engage with their children in contemporary ways for using, communicating and thinking through new technologies. The survey phase of the project, described in this paper, allowed researchers to evaluate access and use of new technologies by parents. For example, this study concluded that 96.7% (n = 60) of parents prefer their children to use technology for school while only 11.7% of parents want their children using technology for social media; while 73.3% of those parents use social media at home themselves, but only 53.3% of them use technology at home for work purposes. These levels of access and use varied in terms of the quantity of new technologies as well as the types of literacy practices that families engage in. There is an important implication to this specific finding because the pedagogical trends in global education are for more converged (Jenkins 2006) and online (or at least hybrid) models of twenty-first century learning skills (Ito et al. 2010) than ever. Reflecting on March 2020, for instance, with the ubiquitous use of and leveraging of social media to teach elementary and secondary students during the COVID-19 crisis, understanding the ways that social media works, communicates, and converges films, podcasts, and newsfeeds are essential to do well in school. To achieve in twenty-first century learning implies acumen and competence with curating information online within social media and other genres of digital texts. It also requires capitalizing on online models of collaboration through different digital tools, programs, or applications. The fact that parents discourage social media use where higher SES families might encourage it, signals a key finding about disparate framings of what successful twenty-first century is and looks like.",

The study\u2019s third research question, although not significant, descriptively explains that more immigrant parents like their children using technology for social media in the home versus Canadian parents (ratio of 5:3). Noguer\u00f3n-Liu (2017b) found that immigrant adults have varied understandings of online privacy and digital practices that range from being critical consumers and adept users of social media and software to those who have no online experience. Again, this type of finding spotlights a misconception by newcomer families that technologies take away from academic learning when in fact much of it is about critically framing content, digital practices, and curating the right and accurate types of texts to complete academic tasks and create content.",

Exploring parents\u2019 understandings and apprehensions about using digital resources to support literacy instruction may provide a niche for effective home-school connection opportunities. The age of the children can also be a mitigating factor. Middle school students (both English first-language and ELL) overall did not report using technology for specific purposes, however, ELL middle school students in grade 6 reported using technology to support their own English skills (Li et al. 2015). Perhaps the type of digital resources needs to be more broadly considered. For example, a recent study of newcomer children found that participating in video gaming communities promoted their socialization, technology use and multimodality (Duran 2017). Moreover, video-game based language instruction has been used by H\u00e9ctor (2015) to ameliorate the difficulties surrounding English learning needs of newcomer students from different socio-economic backgrounds.",

            "text": "Newcomer parents need to be drawn into a safe communal space that is supportive, educational and enhances their culturally relevant communication (Xuemei et al. 2016). They need to recognize ways that they can use their cultural backgrounds as funds of knowledge (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005) for academic, school work. A promising example is found with Lee et al. (2018) who facilitated a program supplying refurbished laptops, literacy and technology resources (including bilingual and culturally relevant children\u2019s books) and parent workshops for the immigrant parents of elementary children. It was found that the technology supported parents\u2019 and their children to co-construct literacy learning and agency at home. Noguer\u00f3n-Liu (2017a) also found that it is critical for the school to provide families with devices and training. Such training should include the benefits of utilizing technology to support twenty-first century skills, with a greater focus on content creation, problem solving tasks, and creativity and innovation. Yet, ultimately, parents still hold distinct beliefs about their role as parents and their children\u2019s ethical and appropriate technology use. As parental beliefs and choices dictate the technological actions of the child, it is imperative that better supports for this interaction are required. There is an ongoing need for family digital literacy programs and support for digital equity in newcomer communities to ultimately allow for a stronger partnership between newcomer parents, children, and school systems.",
