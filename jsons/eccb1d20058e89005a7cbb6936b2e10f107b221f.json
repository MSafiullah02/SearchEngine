            "text": "Inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) is critical in the development of the neuropathology associated with the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent studies have identified a family of soluble proinflammatory molecules called chemokines that are able to direct leukocyte infiltration into the CNS in response to infection or injury. Identification of chemokines within and around demyelinating lesions in MS patients indicate a potential role for these molecules in contributing to the pathogenesis of MS. To address this issue, we have used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the CNS to understand the dynamic interaction of chemokine expression as it relates to inflammation and neuropathology. Our results indicate that chemokine expression within the CNS results in persistent recruitment of both T lymphocytes and macrophages and results in subsequent myelin destruction. Herein, we demonstrate the complexity of the chemokine response to MHV infection of the CNS and the delicate balance that exists between host defense and development of disease.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a single strand, positive sense RNA virus that is a member of the Coronaviradae family. As with many viruses, the disease induced by MHV infection depends upon a variety of different factors such as host and viral genetics as well as the dose and route of inoculation. For example, intracranial (i.c.) infection of susceptible strains of mice such as C57BL/6 (H-2 b background) with the neuroattenuated variant MHV strain J2.2v-1 results in infection of glial cells and oligodendrocytes resulting in an acute encephalomyelitis accompanied by white matter destruction. Type I interferons are expressed early following infection and this correlates with recruitment of neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells into the CNS. Although not completely understood, it is thought that these components of the innate immune response control viral spread prior to the entry of virus-specific T cells as well as participate in amplifying chemokine expression within the CNS that results in the induction of the adaptive immune response. CD8 + T cells are the primary effector component of the adaptive immune response and are able to eliminate infectious virus from the host through secretion of IFN-7 (oligodendrocytes) and perforinmediated cytolysis (astrocytes and microglia) (1, 2) . CD4 + T cells can also directly participate in reducing viral burden presumably through the release of antiviral cytokines such as IFN-7. However, CD4 + T cells also play an essential role in host defense by providing support for CD8 + T cells (3, 4) . Although both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are potent anti-viral effector cells within the CNS, sterile immunity is not achieved and viral RNA and protein persist primarily within white matter tracts in which astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are the predominant cellular reservoirs for virus. Viral persistence in white matter tracts results in a chronic demyelinating disease in which foci of demyelination are associated with areas of viral RNA/antigen. Clinically, mice develop loss of tail tone and a partial to complete hind-limb paralysis. Recent reports have indicated that MHV-induced demyelination is complex and involves immunopathologic responses against viral antigens expressed in infected tissues. MHV infection of immunosuppressed or immunodeficient mice results in high titers of virus within the CNS and increased mortality but no detectable demyelination (5) . Further, adoptive transfer of MHV-immune splenocytes restores demyelination to the infected recipients suggesting a role for immune cells in driving demyelination (5) . We have recently demonstrated that CD4 -/-mice displayed a significant reduction in the severity of demyelination as compared to CD8 -/ and immunocompetent wildtype mice suggesting an important role for CD4 \u00f7 T cells in amplifying the severity of white matter destruction (6) . Additional support for T cells in contributing to demyelination comes from a recent report by Wu et al. (3) that demonstrated that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are important in mediating myelin destruction following adoptive transfer into MHV-infected RAG1 -/-mice. Although B cells and/or antibodies have been shown to play an important role in controlling the recrudescence of virus during the chronic stage of disease, they are not important in MHV-induced demyelination (7) . We and others have found that macrophages/microglia are also important in contributing to demyelination (3, 6, 8) . Current evidence suggests that demyelination in MHV-infected mice is not the result of epitope spreading and induction of an immune response against neuroantigens as has recently been reported to occur during Theiler's virus-induced demyelination (9) . It is likely that T cells present within the CNS of MHV-infected mice are specific for viral antigens and these cells drive demyelination by producing and/or influencing the production of cytokines/chemokines that amplify and support inflammation. Therefore, collective evidence points to a role for inflammatory T cells in contributing to macrophage/microglia infiltration and activation that results in myelin destruction. Collectively, these studies illustrate the complexity of the MHV system as it relates to the immune response and demyelination.",

Numerous cytokines including TNF-c~, IL-1 [3, and IL-6 are produced by activated astrocytes within the CNS of persistently infected mice (10) . Working in concert or individually, these molecules may contribute to disease and myelin destruction by attracting T cells and macrophages into the CNS. However, the soluble signals that regulate CNS invasion by inflammatory cells likely consist of additional factors. With this in mind, studies from our laboratory have focused on chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) and the role these molecules have in MHV-induced demyelination. This chapter will focus on recent studies evaluating the functional significance of chemokine expression as it relates to disease development following MHV infection of the CNS.",

However, much attention has focused on the beneficial and detrimental role of chemokines in leukocyte recruitment in response to infection (11, 13, (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) . A wide variety of cell types can produce chemokines in response to pathogen, including monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and astrocytes. Although many of these cells can produce a diverse array of chemokines, specific chemokine production appears to be linked to the type and strength of the stimuli present. Chemokines are able to induce leukocyte migration into tissue by promoting the adherence and extravasation of leukocytes across the vascular endothelium. Once inside the inflamed tissue, leukocytes are able to migrate across chemokine gradients towards the highest localized concentration. These gradients are established through the binding of the highly basic chemokines to the acidic extracellular matrix on the luminal side of the endothelium. This interaction may also allow for reduced chemokine diffusion and help establish a fixed gradient towards the site of infection (29) .",

The majority of chemokine receptors belong to the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Unlike the specificity observed between most ligand receptor pairs, chemokines exhibit a high level of promiscuity, capable of productively binding to multiple chemokine receptors and chemokine receptors can functionally bind multiple chemokines (34) (35) (36) (37) . Following chemokine binding to its cognate receptor, signaling events are initiated that result in various cellular processes including increases in intracellular calcium, production of cytokines and chemokines, adhesion to the endothelial matrix, and chemotaxis (38) . Interestingly, numerous CXC and CC chemokines can also bind to a receptor identical to the Duffy blood group antigen that is present on the surface of erythrocytes (39) (40) (41) . Binding of chemokines to these receptors does not result in intracellular signaling events, instead it appears to reduce the level of circulating chemokines that may decrease unwanted interactions between chemokines and leukocytes within the blood, maximizing the ability of circulating leukocytes to migrate to highly concentrated chemokine levels at the site of infection (40, 42, 43) .",

At this time, the cellular source of CXCL10 transcripts are primarily ependymal cells lining the lateral ventricle (51) .

In situ double-labeling revealed that astrocytes are the predominant cellular source of mRNA transcripts for CXCL9 and CXCL10 during the acute stage of disease (21, 51) . In addition, MHV-infection of mouse cultured astrocytes results in the rapid induction of numerous chemokine genes including CXCL1, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL4, and CCL7 (6). UV-inactivated MHV was sufficient to trigger low level chemokine gene expression indicating that viral replication is not necessary to induce expression of these genes (51) .

These data suggested that CD4 + T cells are the predominant source of CCL5 following MHV infection of the CNS, although it is also possible that CD4 + T cells influence expression of CCL5 by other cell populations through the release of cytokines and/or chemokines. Additional cellular sources such as CD8 + T cells, macrophage and glial cells must be considered due to the fact that CCL5 mRNA transcripts and protein are detected, albeit at lower levels, within the CNS of CD4 -/-mice.

Moreover, administration of neutralizing anti-CCL5 antibodies to MHV-infected mice in which disease e.g. demyelination and paralysis is already established resulted in a marked improvement in neurologic disease that correlated with reduced T cell infiltration and a reduction in the severity of myelin destruction (Glass and Lane, unpublished observations).

Analysis of CCR5 expression within the CNS of MHV-infected mice revealed that the majority of cells expressing this receptor were macrophage/microglia (24) . MHV infection of CCR5 -/ mice did not result in an increase in either morbidity or mortality as compared to infected CCR5 +/+ mice. In addition, clearance of virus from the CNS of infected CCR5 / mice was not impaired and this correlated with equivalent levels of infiltrating T cells into the CNS when compared to MHV-infected CCR5 +/+ mice. These data indicate that the expression of this receptor does not contribute to host defense. However, demyelination was reduced in MHV-infected CCR5 -/ mice and this correlated with reduced levels of infiltrating macrophages as compared to CCR5 +/+ mice. These data suggest that CCL5 signaling through CCR5 is an important mechanism whereby macrophages are able to enter the CNS and contribute to demyelination. Additional support for the importance of CCR5 signaling in leukocyte migration comes from recent studies from our laboratory examining the outcome of MHV infection of CCL3 knock-out mice. In addition to CCL5, CCL3 is able to bind and signal through CCR5 and trigger T cell and macrophage activation and trafficking. Intracranial infection of CCL3 -/ mice resulted in diminished T cell and macrophage accumulation within the CNS that correlated with a significant reduction in demyelination as compared to MHV-infected wild-type mice (22) . Therefore, these data demonstrate that CCR5 signaling by either CCL3 or CCL5 enhances both T cell and macrophage trafficking and accumulation within the CNS of MHVinfected mice and this correlates with the severity of myelin destruction.",

In contrast, adoptive transfer of virus-specific CD4 + T cells obtained from immunized CCR5 / mice resulted in only limited numbers of T cells present within the CNS and diminished CCL5 expression that correlated with a reduction in macrophage infiltration and demyelination. Examination of chemokine receptor expression on virus-specific CD4 + T cells derived from CCR5 +/+ and CCR5 ~/-mice indicated a marked decrease in mRNA transcripts for several receptors. Notably, CXCR3, which is the signaling receptor for CXCL10, was significantly reduced. These data imply that CCR5 signaling may regulate expression of additional chemokine receptors which enhance T cell trafficking into target tissues. In contrast, CCR5 signaling is not required for trafficking of virus-specific CD8 + T cells into the CNS (Glass and Lane, unpublished observations). However, CCR5 does appear to contribute to effector functions of CD8 + T cells as CD8 + T cells lacking CCR5 exhibit increased production of IFN-~, and increased cytolytic activity as compared to wildtype mice.

Analysis of the functional contributions of CXCL10 during the acute stage of disease indicated a direct role in activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cell chemotaxis into the CNS. The correlation between T cell infiltration and demyelination following MHV infection as well as the appearance of CXCL10 during the chronic stage of MHV disease suggested that this chemokine may also contribute to T cell mediated myelin destruction. To address the functional contributions of CXCL10 to MHV induced demyelination, mice were treated with anti-CXCL10 neutralizing antibodies 12 days following i.c. infection. Strikingly, anti-CXCL10 treatment not only stopped further progression of myelin destruction, but decreased the severity of clinical symptoms as compared to mice treated with control antibody (31) . Histological analysis revealed that reduced clinical symptoms correlated with a dramatic reduction in the level of demyelination within anti-CXCL10treated mice. Furthermore, this decrease in behavioral deficits correlated with the presence of increased levels of remyelination within the CNS as assessed by electron microscopy. Analysis of T cell infiltration following anti-CXCL10 treatment indicated a dramatic reduction in CD4+T cells while CD8 + T cell levels remained similar to control. The preferential effect on CD4 + T cells was in contrast to effects observed following anti-CXCL10 treatment during the acute stage of disease, where both CD4 \u00f7 and CD8 \u00f7 T cell migration was compromised (20) . However, analysis of CXCR3 expression on infiltrating lymphocytes during both the acute and chronic stage of MHV infection indicated that while both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells express abundant CXCR3 expression during the acute disease, CD4 \u00f7 T cells preferentially express increased levels of the CXCL10 receptor during chronic disease, suggesting that receptor expression is responsible for selective CD4 + T cell migration (31) . Regardless, these results indicate that CD4 \u00f7 T cell infiltration can contribute not only to myelin destruction, but also inhibit remyelination following MHV infection. These results indicate that one mechanism by which CXCL10 can contribute to demyelination is by recruiting activated CD4 \u00f7 T cells into the CNS that can participate in disease pathogenesis.",

            "text": "MHV infection of the CNS provides a consistent, reliable model in which to study not only host response to viral infection but also to determine the contributions of chemokines to neuroinflammation and demyelination. Although the studies mentioned above indicate a complex web of chemokines and chemokine receptor expression, analysis of individual chemokines utilizing knockout mice and neutralizing antibodies has indicated specific and selective roles for these molecules within the CNS. As depicted in Figure 1 , chemokines are expressed within the CNS throughout MHV infection, and have now been shown to participate in the recruitment and/or activation of cells based on their temporal expression. Indeed, early expression of CXCLI0 contributes to the development of the innate response that can both control viral replication and further amplify chemokine production aiding in the establishment of the adaptive immune response (Trifilo and Lane, unpublished observations) (Figure 1, 1) . By day 7 p.i., robust expression of numerous CXC and CC chemokines (see Table I ) are detected within the CNS. Highlighted is CXCL10 and CCL5 expression that are critical for the infiltration of T cells (CD4 + and CD8 +) and activated (Figure 1, 2) . T cell infiltration mediates clearance of replicating virus from the CNS by 12 days p.i. through the release of cytokines (ie. IFN-7) and cell mediated cytolysis (CTL). Although replicating virus can no longer be detected, viral protein and RNA persist after 12 days p.i., resulting in chronic expression of both CXCL10 and CCL5 (Figure 1, 3) . These chemokines induce the chronic recruitment of activated T cells and macrophages that subsequently participate in demyelination. This model reveals the protective and destructive properties chemokines posses based on both the level and time of expression. Collectively, our data indicate that chemokines can play specific and selective roles in T lymphocyte and macrophage recruitment within the CNS (CXCL10 and CCL5) as well as contribute to the activation of virus-specific T cells (CCL3). More importantly, although numerous chemokines are detected within the CNS following MHV infection, it is clear that these molecules function in a nonredundant manner, thus meriting further studies on chemokines with regards to the role of these molecules in viral-induced CNS disease. Finally, the data clearly demonstrate that chemokines and their receptors may represent viable targets in modulating the severity of human nueroinflammatory diseases including MS.",
