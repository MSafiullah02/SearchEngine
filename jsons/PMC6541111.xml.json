The murine or xenobiological portions on the one hand and the glycosylation pattern on the other hand determine significantly the immunogenicity of the active biological substance. This leads to for example ADAs (anti-drug antibodies) that at best are neutralizing and lead to ineffectiveness of the applied biological drug, but also potentially to immunological phenomena such as autoimmune hemolysis, cytokine release syndrome, mast cell activation, immune complex hypersensitivity and serum disease. Examples in this context are the relatively high rates of reactions against infliximab or rituximab, which consist of a significant murine proportion\n22\n23\n. Finally, those biologically active substances are complex, large, biotechnologically produced pharmaceutics. Methodological details during production as well as cooling, light, pH, transportation, and application may lead to small molecular changes with potential alterations, such as loss of effectiveness, molecular aggregates, and increased immunogenicity. Furthermore, cross-reacting epitopes may lead to fatal anaphylaxis, especially when the antigens share amino acid sequences with IgE epitopes, e. g., cetuximab.\n",

Since the publication of pivotal trials on combination therapy, it is also applied for advanced head and neck carcinomas\n24\n25\n26\n. Already during approval studies in the early 2000ies, regional differences became apparent in the USA with regard to the incidence of anaphylactic reactions. In 2007, O\u2019Neil could show that the first administration of the drug had a global probability of less than 3% to develop anaphylactic reactions. In the middle southeast of the USA, however, e. g., in Virginia, this rate amounted to up to 20%\n27\n28\n. This reaction is of completely different nature compared to the relatively frequent cutaneous reactions\n29\n. In 2013, Platt-Mills and colleagues could clarify the mechanism of sensitization and association with tick bites and allergy against red meat\n30\n31\n. The regional distribution of a tick species, the so-called lone-star tick, leads to the development of galactose-alpha-1.3-galactose (alpha-GAL) specific IgE antibodies after tick bite. Alpha-GAL is a nearly ubiquitously expressed oligosaccharide of glycoproteins of the cell surface in all non-primate mammalians, prosimians, and new world monkeys. In primates (old world monkeys and humans), about 1% of the circulating IgG pool correspond to alpha-GAL antibodies, and alpha-GAL is a relevant biological obstacle of a simple xenotransplantation\n32\n. Since 2014, commercial test systems are available that can be applied to determine specific IgE against alpha-GAL. The exclusion of sensitization to avoid anaphylactic reactions prior to application of humanized antibodies can be life-saving for patients with high-risk profiles. High-risk patients are individuals with many tick bites (e. g., forestry professionals), with cat allergy, and pork-cat syndrome\n33\n. The determination of alpha-GAL in this high-risk cohort is a showcase of personalized medicine according to the WHO definition: avoiding side effects by specific characterization of patients.\n",

Therefore, the concept of biosimilars was developed\n36\n. Ledford\n37\ndefined biosimilars as an inexact copy of a reference substance. The major question from the immunological point of view is: How similar do biosimilars have to be compared to the original substance, or more bluntly: how similar is similar? The instrumental definition of the EMA considers a biosimilar as highly similar to the original substance in all relevant aspects, i. e., effective mechanism, safety, production process. In the European Union, at least one clinical trial is required from the manufacturers of biosimilars to document the biological equivalence which implicates a relevant switchability of the biosimilar with the originator substance. In addition, extensive immunogenicity data and data on the production process have to be made available. From this regulatory context it is mandatory for the manufacturers to commit themselves to permanent pharmacovigilance and extensive quality management. If the biological equivalence is confirmed, the biosimilar may be introduced onto the market under the INN name. Based on this certified equivalence, the approval authorities can allow an extrapolation, i. e., based on the available data, it is assumed that the biosimilar works also in all other approved indications, equivalently to the originator substance\n38\n39\n. The switchability and the extrapolation are the aspects that are controversially discussed among Immunologists because the majority of patients with autoimmune diseases receive this medication in addition to other immunomodulatory treatments. Thus, the evaluation of the induction of ADAs and the switchability are particularly complex. On the basis of the data that are currently available for the approval authorities, however, the possibility of switching the approved biosimilars is assumed\n38\n. Pharmaceutics that are very similar to an originator substance but that do not pass this regulatory process (e. g., in the EU controlled by the EMA, in the USA by the FDA), are called intended copies. Those drugs can be purchased for example in emerging countries but they are not approved in the EU.\n",

The cilia have multiple functions; it could be shown among others that they are chemosensory. At the same time, the intact respiratory epithelium is the basis for functionally intact defense\n54\n55\n. At transition points to enhanced mechanical use, e. g., in the pharynx, the epithelium merges into a stratified squamous epithelium. In this epithelium, goblet cells are found that produce mucins. These mucins play an elementary role in the unspecific mucosal immunity; they contribute to the barrier function, interact in an antimicrobial way with multiple antimicrobial peptides and defensins\n56\n, develop a highly flexible and complex mucin-interactome\n57\n, and act synergistically with inflammatory cytokines, e. g., IL-1\u03b2\n58\n. Submucous glands produce nasal lining secretions, these consist of both, a transsudative (vasomotor) and a secretory layer.

Mucosal IgA has multiple functions of immune exclusion due to various affinities\n61\nand thus it contributes relevantly to the mucosal immunity of the respiratory mucosa and determines an active antigen-specific protection at this important external border of the upper airways, which is the most exposed external surface of the human body in relation to the covered surface.\n",

This involves tissue macrophages, eosinophilic, neutrophilic granulocytes, basophils, and mast cells, that act according to stimuli and pathology. Intraepithelial lymphocytes of the CD4 and CD8 type act in an antigen specific and adaptive manner. Together with submucous lymphocyte infiltrates of the lamina propria and special, functionally adapted NALT regions with adapted M cells and dome areas, \u03b3\u03b4T cells\n62\n, innate lymphoid cells (ILC)\n63\nas well as NKT cells may induce tolerogenic, allergic, or cytotoxic immune responses\n64\n65\n. Furthermore, the pharyngeal tonsil, which usually should involute by school age, is part of the integrated mucosal system in the nasopharynx. Beside T cell infiltrates in e. g., allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, also areas of local IgE production by B cells\n66\nas well as dendritic cells\n67\n68\nexist. Together with macrophage-like dendritic CD11+CD14+CD68 cells, those professional, antigen presenting, partly immature CD1+CD11+ cells form a dense network for regulation of adaptive immune responses\n69\nand express especially in atopics the highly affine IgE receptor Fc\u03b5RI as well as costimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD86, and CD40\n70\n. There is evidence, that apart from lymphoepithelial areas respiratory epithelium adapts functionally to existing immunological conditions. Hereby, it is modified by inflammatory stimuli such as e. g., IFN\u03b3 or IL-4 in its transcriptome and consecutively functional properties. This leads for example to a defective barrier function due to reduced expression of tight junction proteins\n71\n. However, the epithelium is acting as an immunointerface in the initiation and maintenance of e. g., allergic inflammation. This involves inflammatory cytokines such as TSLP\n72\n, IL-25\n73\n, or IL-24\n74\nand epithelial alarmins such as IL-33, that contribute mucosal inflammation\n75\n. In the full picture of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis of the western subtype, predominantly a type 2 inflammation is found with eosinophilic infiltrates, local expression of IL-5, IL-13, and the presence of IgE\n76\n77\n78\n(see also chapter 2.4 in\n52\n).\n",

Actually, S. aureus IgE is also found in severe adult asthma\n116\nand the involvement of superantigens in atopic eczema is documented clinically as well as experimentally\n117\n. Hence it is very difficult to estimate the role of a complex microbiome in these heterogenic cohorts that are often pretreated with antibiotics.

In the airways, the viscous mucus that can only hardly be mobilized leads to recurrent, opportunistic, and often life-threatening broncho-pulmonary and upper-airway infections. In cases of missing enzyme substitution, the altered function in the gastrointestinal tract results in malnutrition syndromes due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

A sound mechanistic understanding, however, is the basis for a targeted, ideally precise and personalized therapy. Hypothesis-driven research in immunology and inflammation of the past 30 years has identified the association of allergic airway diseases with phenotypically predominant eosinophilia to the Th2 diseases mainly on the basis of the also didactically elegant Th1/Th2 model\n9\n10\n. In nasal polyps this was first shown by Bachert\n76\n, further intensified investigations revealed cytokine patterns\n77\nand also the involved T cell clones\n161\nfollowed. However, for example in Asian cohorts, distinct IL-17 associated inflammatory pattern were\n162\n. Interestingly, mucosal inflammatory patterns have revealed a transition to a more \u201cwestern\u201d cytokine profile over time, probably associated with socio-cultural transition\n163\n. Furthermore, patients were diagnosed with CRSwNP in central China in whom none of the expected or \u201cclassic\u201d cytokine microenvironments was dominant, i. e., neither Th1 nor Th2 nor Th17 inflammation\n164\n.

Inflammatory parameters (MPO, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8), type 2 inflammation markers (IgE, ECP, IL-5, and albumin), in the 3\nrd\ngroup IL-17, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-22, and additionally in 2 further groups IFN\u03b3, TGF\u03b2\n1\n, S. aureus enterotoxin IgE were examined in the context of a hierarchic cluster analysis.

IL-5 negative groups clinically showed mainly chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis and without asthma whereas the IL-5 positive groups, which also had a high systemic and local IgE level, contained a high percentage of asthma-affected patients. Patients who had particularly high IgE values as well as specific IgE against S. aureus enterotoxin generally suffered from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and nearly all of them from comorbid bronchial asthma. However, unfortunately this trial has one relevant weakness: Even if further clinical data have been assessed, they are not included, i. e., data on standardized symptom scores and/or disease-related quality of life.

Actually, monitoring of this T cell conversion to regulatory populations is extremely difficult and in humans it is only possibly by extensive ex vivo examinations\n205\n206\n. Antigen-specific monitoring is only performed via flow cytometric analyses with tetramers or ELISpots\n207\n208\n. Mechanistic studies on specific immunotherapy could show that the induction of regulatory T cells is associated with the secretion of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2\n1\nand IL-10; IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secreting T cells are reduced\n209\n210\n211\n212\n.

On this basis, the concept of combined specific immunotherapy with human anti IL-4 antibodies was developed. The antibody VAK694 is a fully human antibody directed against the cytokine IL-4 and was applied in patients in the context of an exploratory, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-arm study. Primary endpoint of the trial was the cutaneous allergen-specific late-stage reaction as antigen-specific surrogate for T cell suppression 12 months after therapy in vivo. Explorative surrogate endpoint was the antigen-specific production of IL-4 in ELISpots in vitro. Furthermore, the T cell populations were characterized by flow cytometry. The study was designed as proof-of-concept trial and not sufficiently powered for detection of symptom differences between the therapy groups in the pollen season. The primary endpoint, tolerance in the cutaneous late phase response compared to standard therapy, i. e., specific immunotherapy alone, was not achieved because standard therapy alone reached a suppression of the allergen-induced late phase response in the skin of more than 90% although a subeffective dosage of the allergen had been chosen. The proof of concept was achieved in vitro: a sustainable suppression of allergen-specific IL-4 producing cells could be shown 12 months after the end of combined therapy and in comparison to immunotherapy alone as well as placebo. This effect, however, did not translate into the clinical endpoint, the cutaneous late phase reaction\n215\n. If the combination of anti-IL-4 with specific immunotherapy is pursued, remains unclear because the development of VAK694 was stopped.\n",

            "text": "\nThe role of IgE in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis as well as parasite defense was described already very early\n216\n. In 1970, IgE was found for the first time in tissue homogenates in nasal polyposis\n217\n, and Whiteside examined it in 1975\n218\nregarding local lymphocytes and the correlation with systemic IgE levels and atopy. Already at that time, the question of local IgE production in nasal polyps was addressed which became a relevant research issue in the pathophysiology of CRS. In 2001, Bachert could show that the proportion of IgE in the tissue correlates with local eosinophilic infiltrates\n78\n. In the early 2000ies, the association with specific IgE against S. aureus enterotoxin\n146\n219\nwas discovered, in particular in severe cases, which was another hint to pathophysiologic involvement of IgE. In 2005, Gevaert could document the local IgE synthesis in the tissue\n66\n. From here, it was a logic consequence to investigate the therapeutic application of omalizumab in patients with CRSwNP in clinical trials. First case reports and retrospective case series were published by Penn\n220\n, Guglielmo\n221\n, and Vennera\n222\n, mainly in patients who were treated in-label with omalizumab because of their severe asthma. Pinto and colleagues were the first research group that published a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study could reveal no superiority of the verum arm compared to placebo. This was also due to the inclusion criteria because in this study patients with as well as without nasal polyposis were included\n223\n. A placebo-controlled follow-up trial published by Gevaert in 2013 with application of omalizumab in patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma over a treatment period of 16 weeks, could consistently observe a reduction of the nasal polyp score (\u22122.67; P=0.001) as well as the nasal symptom score and the disease-related quality of life in comparison to placebo\n224\n(\nFig. 3\n). Further studies in the context of this indication have already been completed according to the study registries (NCT01066104), at the time of manuscript submission the results have not been published. Subsequent studies on CRS have been registered as actively recruiting, among others under\nclinicaltrials.gov\n.\n",

Pharmaco-dynamic investigations under omalizumab treatment additionally show that the de novo IgE synthesis decreases of about 50% per year with the treatment with omalizumab\n225\n. This observation can be explained by a possible change of the IgE homeostasis because of negative feedback mechanisms that involve the low-affine IgE receptor.

The first trial in humans and actual milestone trial of CRSwNP was published by Gevaert in 2006. In this first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, a total of 24 patients with bilateral CRSwNP received a single dose of the humanized anti-IL-5 antibody reslizumab or placebo. The effect on systemic eosinophils in the blood and ECP concentrations in the serum could be pharmaco-dynamically measured up to 8 weeks. Only half of the patients treated with the real substance showed a therapeutic effect on the endoscopically revealed polyp scores. In a post-hoc analysis, Gevaert and colleagues could demonstrate that the responders were those patients who had high IL-5 concentrations in nasal secretion at the time of treatment onset. By means of a regression analysis, a cut-off value for IL-5>40 pg/ml in nasal lining secretions could be defined that could predict a positive therapy outcome after reslizumab application (odds ratio: 21.0; 95% CI: 1.5-293.3; P=0.009). A multicenter study with reslizumab conducted in the USA investigated the effectiveness of poorly controlled eosinophilic bronchial asthma. Interestingly, reslizumab was more effective in the subgroup of asthma patients with known CRSwNP compared to asthma patients without polyposis\n226\n.

Individualized therapy as well as the population-based stratification and prevention play a key role in personalization\n248\n. The risk to neglect patients by molecular stratification should be taken seriously. We determine endotypes in our algorithms without knowing the complete pathophysiological picture. Avoiding side effects and not treating patients who do not express a certain biomarker or who are characterized as potential non-responders, has nothing in common with individualism and participation in the therapeutic decision-making process and does certainly not reflect the expectations that our patients have with regard to personalized medicine. Hence, this procedure is meanwhile current practice for oncological patients. A molecular determinism possibly puts at risk a well-informed healthcare behavior\n249\n, however, the application of biomarkers (e. g., for blood type or the identification of allergic sensitization) in stratified therapy belongs to the standard of modern medicine (e. g., blood type compatible products, allergen-specific immunotherapy)\n250\n.\n",
