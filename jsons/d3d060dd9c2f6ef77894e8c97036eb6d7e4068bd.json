To address this issue, we define and solve a novel academic search task, called aspect-based retrieval, which allows the user to specify the aspect along with the query to retrieve a ranked list of relevant documents. The primary idea is to estimate a language model for the aspect as well as the query using a domain-specific knowledge base and use a mixture of the two to determine the relevance of the article. Our evaluation of the results over the Open Research Corpus dataset shows that our method outperforms keyword-based expansion of query with aspect with and without relevance feedback.",

We illustrate this expected behavior with a concrete example: consider the query autoencoder and an aspect of interest, say, application, then we aim to rank high the articles which are related to the concept of autoencoder and are about the applications of autoencoders. If there were two papers, titled (a) \"Complex-valued Autoencoders\" and (b) \"Exploring autoencoders for unsupervised feature selection\", our system should rank the paper (b) higher than paper (a) since it specifically deals with applications of the specified query rather than its variants.",

Aspectbased retrieval of scientific documents is not straightforward at all since the relation semantics do not manifest as simple keyword matches. Simply expanding the query with terms that define the aspect fails to retrieve relevant articles. In the above example, the paper (b) does not contain the application in the title as well as the abstract. On the other hand, a document, titled \"Evaluating the Performance of Dynamic Database Applications\" is not related to the query RDBMS along the application aspect although its title contains the term applications. The way in which the specified semantic relationship manifests between the query and a document is highly dependent on the domain we operate in. For example, given the query autoencoder, for a document to be related along application aspect, the presence of terms like feature or selection with terms similar to application would be highly suggestive because feature selection is known to be an application of autoencoder. But this can not be easily determined by just analysing the documents without prior knowledge of the domain.",

The query and aspect models are derived using domain-specific knowledge bases (KBs), which is challenging in itself due to the inherent sparsity of relations in these KBs. By using a domain-specific KB of computer science, like TeKnowbase [14] , we show how to overcome the sparsity issue in KB via inference using meta-paths derived from the KB. Our results over the Open Research Corpus [1] dataset containing more than 39 million published research papers show that our proposed approach outperforms variants of query likelihood language models with/without relevance feedback.",

Additionally, we fired queries of the form \"query+aspect\" to retrieve the top-10 documents using the same model. We recruited evaluators to annotate about 1500 documents with the aspect labels (described in details in Sect. 3.2). In order to increase the size of our document set, we used heuristics to collect more documents given an aspect. We formulated a query containing only the aspect as a keyword and retrieved documents for it using the standard likelihood model. But, we retained only those documents which contained the name of the aspect in the title on the intuition that such documents are highly likely (though not guaranteed) to be about those aspects.

The triple speech recognition, application, hidden markov model conveys information that speech recognition is an application of hidden markov model. The entities connected via application relation in T KB have a higher probability of appearing in documents addressing application aspect. However, T KB is sparse. To automatically infer the entities participating in a particular relationship type, we used meta-paths. A meta-path is a sequence of edges with labels connecting two nodes which have been used previously for KB completion tasks [6] , link prediction [8] as well as to find similarity between two nodes [11, 13] . Figure 1 shows how meta-paths can be used to infer relationships between entities. (1) Direct inference using meta-paths. To automatically determine entities that participate in a given relationship type with entity ei, we used the path-constrained random walk algorithm (P RA) proposed in [6] . Given a set E of entities in T KB, a source node ei and a meta-path P , a path-constrained random walk defines a probability distribution he i ,P (ej) to all entities in E which is the probability of reaching ej from ei by doing a random walk along P . The key idea is to acquire the set of meta-paths representing the given relationship type and use P RA for inferencing. To do so, we retrieved the set of all meta-paths (MP ) connecting the given relationship type in T KB and scored them according to their frequency. Given a set of metapaths MP = P1, P2, ..., Pn, the score for each node reachable from source ei is given by:",

We observe that our model outperforms the rest of the baselines in terms of precision@5 and DCG for all of the 3 aspects. QL + query + aspect + QE comes second after our retrieval model. By modelling the aspect and query dependant probability explicitly, we were able to address the problems of simple keyword-based match for aspects described in Sects. 1 and 2. For example, the top-2 papers retrieved for genetic algorithm for application aspect by our model were Genetic Ant Algorithm for Continuous Function Optimization and Its MATLAB Implementation and Solve Zero-One Knapsack Problem by Greedy Genetic Algorithm. The top-2 papers retrieved by QL + query + aspect + QE for application aspect do not describe any application of genetic algorithm but contained a few terms like \"a wide application prospect\" in the abstract due to which it was retrieved in the top positions. Adding relevance feedback terms also did not work because the list of pseudo relevant documents did not contain relevant documents in the first place due to plain keyword-based retrieval. Both the papers retrieved by our method address application aspect for genetic algorithm even if \"application\" is not mentioned in the title. ",
