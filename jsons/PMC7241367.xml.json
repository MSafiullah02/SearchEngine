For the same reason the strategy adopted globally has been to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 in order to avoid the overburdening of the healthcare system and preventing its collapse (7). This has been implemented in the form of social distancing and lockdowns. In such dire situations the key is not only to treat the infected but equally essential is to ensure Healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in the care of the patients have a safe working environment. Protection of HCPs is of prime importance because of the risk of infecting other members of the team, patients (8), and indeed family members. Currently 5.7% of the NHS workforce is off sick or in self-isolation (9) with resultant workforce depletion; of more concern is the number HCPs deaths (10), with ethnicity recently questioned as a risk factor. Preventing the spread of infection among the medical personals and then to the patients depends upon the appropriate training and use of the personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013 facemasks, respirators, goggles, face shields, gowns and aprons. Due to the imbalance between the demand and supply, a critical shortage of PPE is expected even in the most developed countries.",

There has been a lot of concern regarding the availability of adequate PPE for the frontline staff (12). Guidance in itself offers no protection till the resources are available for implementation of such guidelines and adequate training provided. Two-third of the respondents in our survey did not think that adequate PPE was available while approximately 50% did not receive adequate local training. A survey (snapshot over 24 hrs) carried out by the Royal College of Physicians (22) in the first week of April revealed 78% respondents could access PPE. A similar survey by the Royal College of Surgeons (23) in the second week of April demonstrated that a third of the surgeons and trainees did not believe that they have adequate PPE supply and about 57% thought that there have been shortages of PPE in the last 30 days preceding the survey.",
