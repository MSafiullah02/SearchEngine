Homeless populations might be more transient and geographically mobile than individuals in the general population,8 making it difficult to track and prevent transmission and to treat those who need care. COVID-19 was recently found to be transmittable via the oral\u2013faecal route.9 Some major US cities with large homeless populations, like San Francisco, have experienced issues with public defecation, which might pose an additional transmission risk for people experiencing homelessness and other individuals. Together, the multitude of potential vulnerabilities and risks for people experiencing homelessness in becoming infected, needing care, and transmitting COVID-19 cannot be ignored and must be planned for. Some lessons can be learned from the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome among homeless service providers nearly two decades ago.10 Testing kits and training on how to recognise COVID-19 should be widely disseminated to homeless service providers and deployed in shelters, encampments, and street outreach. Alternative spaces might be needed to quarantine and treat people experiencing homelessness.",

In lockdowns, public spaces are closed, movement outside homes are restricted, and major roads of transport might be closed, all of which might negatively affect people experiencing homelessness. It is unclear how and where unsheltered people experiencing homelessness will be moved to if quarantines and lockdowns are implemented. In such a scenario, closures of shelters and other high-density communal settings (eg, drop-in centres and soup kitchens) are possible, which could increase the number of unsheltered people experiencing homelessness and reduce their access to needed services. Lockdowns and disease containment procedures might also be deleterious to the mental health of people experiencing homelessness, many of whom have fears around involuntary hospitalisation and incarceration.11\n",

Another complicating matter is that in December, 2019, the US Supreme Court declined to review the case of Martin v City of Boise, upholding a ruling that cities cannot arrest or punish people for sleeping on public property unless cities have provided adequate and accessible indoor accommodations. This legal precedent prevents the criminalisation of homelessness, but it is unclear if and how it will be applied during COVID-19 outbreaks.",
