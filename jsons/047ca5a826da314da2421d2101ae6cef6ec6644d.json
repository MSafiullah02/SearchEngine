            "text": "Background: Medical masks are commonly used in health care settings to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from respiratory and other infections. Airborne respiratory pathogens may settle on the surface of used masks layers, resulting in contamination. The main aim of this study was to study the presence of viruses on the surface of medical masks. Methods: Two pilot studies in laboratory and clinical settings were carried out to determine the areas of masks likely to contain maximum viral particles. A laboratory study using a mannequin and fluorescent spray showed maximum particles concentrated on upper right, middle and left sections of the medical masks. These findings were confirmed through a small clinical study. The main study was then conducted in high-risk wards of three selected hospitals in Beijing China. Participants (n = 148) were asked to wear medical masks for a shift (6-8 h) or as long as they could tolerate. Used samples of medical masks were tested for presence of respiratory viruses in upper sections of the medical masks, in line with the pilot studies. Results: Overall virus positivity rate was 10.1% (15/148). Commonly isolated viruses from masks samples were adenovirus (n = 7), bocavirus (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 2) and influenza virus (n = 2). Virus positivity was significantly higher in masks samples worn for > 6 h (14.1%, 14/99 versus 1.2%, 1/49, OR 7.9, 95% CI 1.01-61.99) and in samples used by participants who examined > 25 patients per day (16.9%, 12/71 versus 3.9%, 3/77, OR 5.02, 95% CI 1. 35-18.60). Most of the participants (83.8%, 124/148) reported at least one problem associated with mask use. Commonly reported problems were pressure on face (16.9%, 25/148), breathing difficulty (12.2%, 18/148), discomfort (9.5% 14/148), trouble communicating with the patient (7.4%, 11/148) and headache (6.1%, 9/148). Conclusion: Respiratory pathogens on the outer surface of the used medical masks may result in selfcontamination. The risk is higher with longer duration of mask use (> 6 h) and with higher rates of clinical contact. Protocols on duration of mask use should specify a maximum time of continuous use, and should consider guidance in high contact settings. Viruses were isolated from the upper sections of around 10% samples, but other sections of masks may also be contaminated. HCWs should be aware of these risks in order to protect themselves and people around them.",

Various types of personal protective equipment (PPE) are recommended and used by HCWs to protect from infections, including medical masks, respirators, gloves, gowns, goggles and face shield [5, 6] . In healthcare settings, medical masks are used by HCWs to protect from splashes and sprays of blood and body fluids, and by sick individuals to prevent spread of respiratory infections to others [7] . Reuse and extended use of masks are also common in many parts of the world, particularly during outbreaks and pandemics [8, 9] . Respiratory pathogens may be present on used masks layers and lead to infection of the wearer [10] . In hospital settings, these pathogens may be generated from breathing, coughing or sneezing patients or during aerosol generating medical procedures [11] . Studies have shown that influenza virus can remain airborne for 3 h after a patient has passed through an emergency department [12] . While using masks, or during long periods of time of re-using them, these pathogens may cause infection through hand or skin contamination, ingestion, or mucus membrane contact [10] .",

Previous studies show that influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may survive on outer surface of PPE [11] [12] [13] [14] . A study showed that influenza viruses may survive on hard surfaces for 24-48 h, on cloth up to 8-12 h and on hands for up to 5 min [13] . A previous study in an Australian Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA was identified from 4% of dress samples and 9% of environmental samples [14] . If health departments do not provide clear guidance on the use of masks in these situations, HCWs may continue using contaminated masks and may get infection [15] . The risk of self-contamination of HCWs is influenced by the mask itself, its shape and properties, and the virus concentration on its surface. To our knowledge, only one study examined the presence of contamination on mask and various bacteria were isolated from outer surface of medical masks [16] . The main aim of this study was to study the level of contamination on the surface of medical masks.",

Pilot studies showed that upper sections of masks were more contaminated (Figs. 1 and 2). The outer layers of upper right, middle and left mask were separated with a same size, placed into separated tubes containing 700 \u03bcl PBS buffer (Gibco, USA), vortexed for 1 min, and finally aliquoted 50 \u03bcl for viral testing. We performed three tests on upper right, middle and upper left sections of the masks on around a quarter mask sample (26%) and performed one test on the remaining mask samples (74%). For one testing, outer layers of upper right, middle and left section of mask were separated and placed into the same tube. Viral DNA/RNA was extracted using King-Fisher Flex 96 viral DNA/RNA purification kit (Thermo Fisher, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify 15 viral target genes, including influenza A/B virus, influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), parainfluenza viruses 1-4, rhinoviruses, bocavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 using a commercial multiplex combined real-time PCR detection kit for Respiratory virus, which is developed by \"Jiangsu Uninovo Biological Technology Co.

Overall virus positivity rate in this was 10.1% (15/148) and adenovirus was isolated from 7 mask samples while bocavirus, RSV and influenza viruses were isolated from 2 samples each. Prospero et al. conducted a study in dental settings and estimated the bacterial contamination on surface of masks used by dentist, lamps, areas near spittoons, and mobile trays. Sterile nitrocellulose filters were applied on these surfaces to isolate pathogens. Highest levels of bacterial contamination (Streptococcus species 42%, Staphylococcus species 41%, and gram-negative bacteria 17%) were recorded on the external surface of masks wore by dentist [16] .

Currently there is no standard duration for the time period that facemasks and respirators can safely One study showed that influenza virus may survive on mask surface and maintained infectivity for at least 8 h [25] . Our study showed very low infection among HCWs who used masks for \u22646 h. High virus positivity on masks samples worn by HCWs who examined > 25 patients, may be due to more frequent clinical contact with infective cases and transfer of more pathogens from patients to mask surface. Virus positivity rates were also higher in those working in internal medicine department compared to respiratory and pediatric departments. The reason of high virus positivity in internal medicine department is not clear, but this may be due to using varying infection control policies and practices. High risk perception and more infection control measures may result in low virus positivity in in respiratory and pediatric departments. However, the sample sizes and number of positive results were too low to make meaningful comparisons between departments. There is a need for more research to define the exact threshold of safe duration, and to develop a comprehensive policy on the use of masks in hospital settings and protocols should specify a maximum time of continuous use and should consider guidance in high contact settings.",

We performed three tests on a sub-sample (26%) to identify the area of maximum concentration. Moreover, we just tested upper three sections of medical masks based on the first pilot study, while lower three sections should also be tested. Then we tested only outer layer of masks and did not check filtering layer and inner layer due to funding constraints. Ideally all sections and layers of masks should be tested. We collected detail history from the participants to rule out any existing respiratory illness. Although none of the participant had a respiratory or a medical illness, it is not possible to determine whether viruses isolated from the masks surface were from exogenous or endogenous source. For example, adenovirus was most commonly identified in this study and is associated with mild or no respiratory illnesses. Ideally participants should also be swabbed to rule out infections, and the inside surface should also be tested. However, given the large variations of infection probability in different types of wards, it is unlikely that all viruses came from the background infection. To overcome this limitation, detailed history on respiratory symptoms was taken to rule out contamination of masks by clinically ill participants themselves. Moreover, we only examined viruses on the masks, while bacteria and other pathogens may also be present [16] . Mask use was not monitored, and self-reported compliance was recorded. Previous studies show that self-reported compliance is generally reported to be higher compared to the actual compliance [26, 27] .
