Given the popularity of Web news services, we focus our attention on news streams mining. News articles are retrieved from Web news services, and processed by data mining tools to produce useful higher-level knowledge, which is stored in a content description database. Instead of interacting with a Web news service directly, by exploiting the knowledge in the database, an information delivery agent can present an answer in response to a user request. A key challenging issue within news repository management is the high rate of document insertion. To address this problem, we present a sophisticated incremental hierarchical document clustering algorithm using a neighborhood search. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is the ability to identify meaningful patterns (e.g., news events, and news topics) while reducing the amount of computations by maintaining cluster structure incrementally. In addition, to overcome the lack of topical relations in conceptual ontologies, we propose a topic ontology learning framework that utilizes the obtained document hierarchy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm produces high-quality clusters, and a topic ontology provides interpretations of news topics at different levels of abstraction.",

Given this popularity of the Web news services, we have focused our attention on mining patterns from news streams. 1 The simplest document access method within Web news services is keywordbased retrieval. Although this method seems effective, there exist at least three drawbacks. First, if a user chooses irrelevant keywords (due to broad and vague information needs or unfamiliarity with the domain of interest), retrieval accuracy will be degraded. Second, since keyword-based retrieval relies on the syntactic properties of information (e.g., keyword counting), 2 semantic gap cannot be overcome. Third, only expected information can be retrieved since the specified keywords are generated from users' knowledge space. Thus, if users are unaware of the airplane crash that occurred yesterday, then they cannot issue a query about that accident even though they might be interested.",

However, it is well known that this approach leads to a degradation of precision. That is, given that the terms introduced by term expansion may have more than one meaning, using additional terms can improve recall, but decrease precision. Exploiting a manually developed ontology with a controlled vocabulary is helpful in this situation [27, 28, 29] . However, although ontology-authoring tools have been developed in the past decades, manually constructing ontologies whenever new domains are encountered is an error-prone and time-consuming process. Therefore, integration of knowledge acquisition with data mining, which is referred to as ontology learning, becomes a must [32] .",

Thus, a reasonable starting point would be provided to assist the user. 2. Lack of topical relations in concept-based ontologies. In order to achieve rich semantic information retrieval, an ontology-based approach would be provided. However, as discussed in Agirre et al. [2] , one of the main prob-lems with concept-based ontologies is that topically related concepts and terms are not explicitly linked. 3 That is, there is no relation between courtattorney, kidnap-police, etc. Thus, concept-based ontologies have a limitation in supporting a topical search. For example, consider the Sports domain ontology that we have developed in our previous work [27, 28, 29] . In this ontology, \"Kobe Bryant\", who is an NBA basketball player, is related with terms/concepts in Sports domain. However, for the purpose of query expansion, \"Kobe Bryant\" needs to be connected with a \"court trial\" concept if a user keeps \"Kobe Bryant court trial\" in mind. Therefore, it is essential to provide explicit links between topically related concepts/terms. 3. High rate of document insertion. As several hundred news articles are published everyday at a single Web news site, triggering the whole mining process whenever a document is inserted to the database is computationally impractical. To cope with such a dynamic environment, efficient incremental data mining tools need to be developed.",

Hence, an event is different from a topic. For example, \"airplane crash\" is a topic while \"Chinese airplane crash in Korea in April 2002\" is an event. Thus, there exists M-1 mapping between event and topic (i.e., multiple events can be on a same topic). Note that it is important to identify events as well as topics. Although the user may not be interested in a flood topic, in general, she may be interested in documents about a flood event in her home town. Thus, a news recommendation system must be able to distinguish different events within a same topic. Yang et al. introduced an important property of news events, referred to as temporal locality [48] . That is, news articles discussing the same event tend to be temporally proximate. In addition, most of the events (e.g., flood, earthquake, wildfire, kidnapping) have short duration (e.g., 1 week -1 month). They exploited these heuristics when computing similarity between two news articles.",

Moreover, the computational complexity of HAC is more expensive than that of partition-based clustering. In partition-based clustering, the computational complexity is O(nKI) where n is the number of documents, K is the number of clusters, and I is the number of iterations, respectively. In contrast, HAC takes O(n 3 ) if pairwise similarities between clusters are changed when two clusters are merged.

Therefore, a term with high selectivity for C i can be a candidate for ST Ci . Based on the definition of ST , the proposed hierarchical clustering algorithm is described. While clusters at level 1 are generated using the algorithm in Figure 3 , if no more documents are inserted to a certain cluster at level 1 during the pre-defined time interval, then we assume that the event for the cluster ends, 7 and associate ST with this cluster at level 1. We then perform a neighborhood search for this cluster at level 2. Since ST reflects the most specific characteristics for the cluster, it is not helpful if two topically similar clusters (but different events) need to be merged. Hence, when we build a vector for C j i , terms in ST (for C j i ) are not included for building a cluster vector. At this moment, it is worthwhile to compare our algorithm with the SNN approach [24, 15] . The basic strategy of SNN clustering is as follows: It first constructs the nearest neighbor graph from the sparsified similarity matrix, which is obtained by keeping only k-nearest neighbor of each entry. Next, it identifies representative points by choosing the points that have high density, and removes noise points that have low density. Finally, it takes connected components of points to form clusters. Table 4 . A sample specific terms for the clusters at level 1. The term with regular font denotes NE.

The re-clustering phase, and special data structures (e.g., DCF or signature vector) make our algorithm more suitable for incremental clustering than SNN. The second distinction is how a neighborhood is defined. In SNN, a neighborhood is defined as a set of k-nearest neighbors while we use -neighborhood. Thus, as discussed in Han et al. [21] , the neighborhood constructed from k-nearest neighbors is local in that the neighborhood is defined narrowly in dense regions while it is defined more widely in sparse regions. However, for document clustering, a global neighborhood approach produces more meaningful clusters. The third distinction is that we intend to build a cluster hierarchy incrementally. In contrast, SNN does not focus on hierarchical clustering. Finally, our algorithm can easily identify singleton clusters. This is especially important in our application since an outlier document on a in a news stream may imply a valuable fact (e.g., a new event or technology that has not been mentioned in previous articles). In contrast, SNN overlooks the importance of singleton clusters.",

Another approach is to use classification, i.e., training dataset is composed of multiple topic classes, and each class is composed of multiple events.

An experimental prototype has been developed, implemented and tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In order to accommodate topics that change over time, we developed the incremental document clustering algorithm based on a neighborhood search. The presented clustering algorithm could identify news event clusters as well as topic clusters incrementally. We also showed that presented topic ontologies could characterize news topics at multiple levels of abstraction. We intend to extend this work into the following five directions. First, although a document hierarchy can be obtained using unsupervised clustering, as shown in Aggarwal et al. [1] , the cluster quality can be enhanced if a preexisting knowledge base is exploited. That is, based on this priori knowledge, we can have some control while building a document hierarchy. Second, besides exploiting text data, we can utilize other information since Web news articles are composed of text, hyperlinks, and multimedia data. For example, as described in [25] , both terms and hyperlinks (which point to related news articles or Web pages) can be used for feature selection. Third, coupling with WordNet [36] , we plan to extend the topic ontology learning framework to accommodating rich semantic information extraction. To this end, we will annotate a topic ontology within Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [38, 54] . Forth, our clustering algorithm can be tested on other datasets like TDT corpus [53] . Finally, to strengthen our work in terms of generality, we are in the process of investigating the potential applicability of our method to earth science information streams.",
