The search for a medication that could reduce risk of serious disease, and ideally of any manifestation of disease from SARS-CoV2, and of asymptomatic shedding of SARS-CoV2 is of urgent interest. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals is among the approaches to achieve these ends. We performed a systematic review of all interventional studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with a focus on one repurposed drug, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The detailed analysis of these studies, some of them already recruiting, provide an overall picture of HCQ use as a COVID-19 prophylaxis around the world. Among the included studies, all but three were randomized and parallel and most of them (74%, 23/31) were double-blinded to quadruple-blinded studies. We found a great diversity in dosing and nearly all the possible scientifically reasonable regimens are under evaluation. This diversity offers benefits as well as challenges. Importantly, the final analysis of these trials should be done through an extensive reading of the results in regard to the clinical design, it will be crucial to carefully read and evaluate the results of each study in regards to the clinical design rather than quickly glancing a 140 characters-based social media message announcing the failure or success of a drug against a disease.",

Indeed, the debate continues to rage regarding the use of HCQ for COVID-19 and we need to shed more light based on clinical evidence. At the present time, the debate is still a nondocumented speculation that will be ended in the next few months.The positive point regarding the high diversity of HCQ regimen among recorded clinical studies is that nearly all the possible regimens are under evaluation. The negative point of the high diversity in HCQ dosage and duration of prophylaxis could be that the conclusion of these different studies may be conflicting. Indeed, it would be surprising that a 200 mg daily dose during one month would have the same efficacy and the same ratio benefit/risk than a 600 mg daily dose during three months.
