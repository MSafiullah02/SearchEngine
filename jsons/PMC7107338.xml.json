            "text": "Today, numerous live-attenuated vaccines are approved, and some of them have been used for decades [6]. The excellent efficacy and safety of this class of vaccines are well established and have allowed the further development of vector systems to deliver antigen originating from other pathogens. The use of viral vectors is a potent tool in gene therapy and vaccine development because of their ability to induce both potent humoral and cellular immune responses. Heterologous antigens can be expressed and delivered at the relevant tissues to generate the most efficient pathogen-specific host responses. In addition, the immunogenicity is further enhanced through intrinsic vector motifs that stimulate the innate immunity pathways [7, 8]. Thus, the use of expensive and mostly reactive adjuvants can be omitted. Viral vectors can use the host-cell protein-processing pathways that lead to antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex class I and consequent cytotoxic T-cell stimulation [9]. In addition, viral vectors can be produced in high quantities at relatively low costs, which allows the use of these systems in low-income countries. Despite the many advantages of potential viral-vector vaccines, preexisting antivector immunity is a major obstacle for development pathways [10]. Vector-specific antibodies may impede the induction of immune responses of the heterologous expressed proteins by reducing the dose and time of exposure to the vaccine antigen [11, 12]. Strategies to overcome this possible problem include increasing vector dose [13, 14], using vectors derived from nonhuman pathogens (eg, chimpanzee adenovirus [Ad] and vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV]) [15], or using heterologous prime-boost approaches [16]. Current strategies to develop CHIKV vaccines based on viral-vector technologies are summarized in Table 1.\n",

This technology is based on measles virus (MV) vaccine Schwarz strain (MV/Schw), a live-attenuated negative-stranded RNA virus, which is one of the safest and most effective human vaccines. The measles vaccine has been widely used in the past 40 years to prevent MV infection and has dramatically reduced childhood mortality from measles by 95% since its introduction. The vaccine is very safe and induces a lifelong protective immunity after a single immunization [27]. The entire virus life cycle is limited to the cytoplasm, which prevents insertion of foreign genes into the host genome. In addition, vaccine doses can be produced on a large scale and distributed at low cost. Conventional and recombinant measles vaccine strains have been extensively studied in past decades as tools in cancer therapy, owing to their intrinsic ability to target and destroy cancer cells. A number of clinical trials have been conducted, in many cases using very high doses (3-4 logs higher, compared with MV vaccine), further demonstrating the safety of this viral vector system [28]. The MV vector thus appears appropriate for developing a safe and cost-effective CHIKV vaccine to be used in the case of CHIKV emergence.",

Tangy et al at the Pasteur Institute in Paris introduced the live-attenuated MV/Schw as a vector to express heterologous viral antigens [31]. A complementary DNA (cDNA) plasmid was generated that contains the full-length infectious antigenome of MV/Schw. Additional ATU sites inserted at different measles virus genomic regions allow the introduction of heterologous genes, which are under the control of cis-acting promoter elements modeled after those present in the nucleocapsid/phosphoprotein boundary region, allowing a transcriptional stop of the upstream gene, as well as autonomous transcription, capping, and polyadenylation of the transgene [31].",

The entire subgenomic open reading frame (ORF) expressing the CHIKV structural genes (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) was inserted in the intergenomic region between the MV phosphoprotein (P) and matrix protein (M). The CHIKV donor sequence was derived from CHIKV strain 06.49 (ECSA strain), a clinical isolate from the 2005/2006 La R\u00e9union Island outbreak. The recombinant MV-CHIKV grows to wild-type titers, showing that the relatively large insert of approximately 3.7 kb did not interfere with the MV life-cycle. Upon infection of Vero cells, the structural CHIKV genes lead to the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) in the cell-culture supernatant. The vaccine candidate induced a robust and protective humoral and cellular immune response in CD46tg/IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice after 1 or 2 immunizations. One hundred percent of the vaccinated animals were protected from lethal challenge after a single immunization, even in the presence of measles preexisting immunity. The passive transfer of MV-CHIK preimmune sera to naive mice conferred protection against a lethal challenge [17].",

All of these vector systems take advantage of the extremely efficient alphavirus RNA replication machinery that makes up to 200 000 RNA copies from each RNA molecule. For CHIKV vaccines, these vectors play a very special role, as CHIKV is also a member of the genus Alphavirus. Experimental alphavirus-based CHIKV vaccines are replication-competent chimeric viruses. The constructs are composed of the CHIKV structural genes combined with less pathogenic alphaviral nonstructural genes. Previous studies on neurotropic alphaviruses showed that the combination of replicative enzymes from one alphavirus with the structural proteins of another resulted in highly attenuated phenotypes in small-animal models [39]. The insertion of genetic elements that alter the virus life cycle further increased the safety of this vector system.",

All 3 chimeras induced robust neutralizing antibody titers in vaccinated C57BL/6 or National Institutes of Health Swiss mice. Even at high doses, the animals did not show any sign of neurological disease, demonstrating the preclinical safety of these vaccine candidates. The TC-83 and the naturally attenuated Eastern equine encephalitis backbones were more immunogenic than the Sindbis virus backbone [18]. To further increase the safety and potency of the vaccine candidates, their mechanisms of replication and virus host interactions were investigated. The promoters regulating the CHIKV structural genes were replaced by an encephalomyocarditis virus\u2013derived internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). In both immunocompetent CD-1 mice and immunocompromised type 1 interferon\u2013deficient A129 mice, a single vaccination induced robust neutralizing titers and protected these mice against CHIKV viremia and death after CHIKV challenge. An important feature regarding safety was the inhibition of virus replication in mosquito cells through the IRES, making mosquito transmission of these novel vectors impossible [40]. In another approach, an attenuated CHIKV was generated by the introduction of the IRES in the CHIKV genome, resulting in an effective and safe vaccine candidate [41]. Details are reviewed elsewhere in this issue by Weaver et al.",

CAdVax is based on the Ad5 backbone and lacks E1, E2, and most of E4. The transgene is under the control of the immediate early human cytomegalovirus promoter and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (BGHpA) sequence. Both CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice were immunized once or twice via the intraperitoneal route. High levels of CHIKV-specific antibodies were induced after a single vaccination. Neutralizing antibody titers against the homologous ECSA strain and a heterologous Asian strain reached similar high levels. In addition, vaccinated animals were challenged in the rear feet with a homologous or heterologous CHIKV strain, which induce arthritic disease as manifested by self-limiting perimetatarsal swelling [44]. A single immunization with CAdVax-CHIK protected against CHIKV viremia and joint swelling. Together, the data presented here showed a potent experimental vaccine that can be further evaluated for use in humans.",

Martina et al describe the generation and characterization of 3 recombinant MVA viruses expressing CHIKV inserts derived from the CHIKV-S27 strain: 6KE1, E2E1, and the entire envelope protein cassette E3-E2-6K-E1. Immunization of immunocompromised AG129 mice with the 3 recombinant viruses induced neutralizing antibodies to the homologous CHIKV S27 strain. The titers elicited by MVA-6KE1 and MVA-E3E2 were low (PRNT50, 10\u201320), while the titers induced by the full envelope gene were significantly higher (PRNT50, 40\u2013160). Interestingly, both MVA-E3E26KE1 and MVA-E3E2 fully protected CHIKV-susceptible AG129 mice against lethal challenge with CHIKV S27 strain [21]. Similar findings were reported in another laboratory with a recombinant MVA construct expressing E3-E2 only. The selection of the E2 antigen as a single immunogen was driven by a recent study that described the E2 as the major neutralizing antigen after primary infection [49]. The coexpression of E3 peptide facilitates correct folding of the E2 protein. A total of 100% of wild-type BALB/c mice immunized with the MVA-E3-E2 vector were protected from viremia. Additionally, A129 mice lacking the type 1 IFN receptor were protected from viremia, footpad swelling, and mortality. Despite recent data suggesting that E2 would contain the main neutralizing epitope, the sera of mice immunized with MVA-E3-E2 had very low neutralizing antibody titers. In addition, the passive transfer of sera from immunized mice did not protect against lethal challenge in A129 mice. However, CD4+ T cells were critical in protecting mice against challenge [22]. Together, these 2 independent studies clearly demonstrate that neutralizing antibodies can confer protection against CHIKV infections; however, a role for cellular responses cannot be ruled out. Garcia-Arriaza et al described another MVA vaccine candidate with an E3-E2-6K-E1 CHIKV insert derived from the Indian Ocean strain LR2006-OPY. This vaccine strain induced very high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a strong cellular CD8+ T-cell response. The MVA-CHIK vaccine protected C57BL/6 mice against challenge in a footpad-swelling model [23].",

The virus backbone has been used as an experimental vaccine vector against several viral and bacterial pathogens. Very recently, a recombinant VSV vaccine expressing Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein G was tested in a phase 1/2 trial involving 59 healthy volunteers [50]. The vaccine was reactogenic in humans, and the most effective dose for an acceptable immunogenicity/tolerability ratio has yet to be determined. VSV vectors lacking glycoprotein G (VSV\u0394G) can be used to express heterologous viral antigens to produce chimeric viruses. An experimental vaccine was designed to express the CHIKV structural genes (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) in a VSV or VSV\u0394G backbone. Recombinant viruses in the VSV\u0394G incorporated the CHIKV proteins on their surface and allowed propagation in cell culture. Mice immunized with either VSV-CHIK or VSV\u0394G-CHIK induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies. The VSV\u0394G-CHIK vaccine induced a superior antibody response. Vaccinated animals were protected against challenge in a footpad swelling mouse model, and these animals showed reduced viremia levels. In addition, the VSV-CHIK constructs induced a CHIKV E1\u2013 and CHIKV E2\u2013specific IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing T-cell response after a single immunization. These data demonstrate a potent and effective vector system for the expression of CHIKV antigens. A major advantage of this system is the lack of antivector antibodies due to the lack of the G surface protein. However, the reactogenicity of this system in humans has to be further observed in detail before large-scale clinical trials can be launched.",

The experimental vaccines were potent and safe in animal models. The vaccine safety and potency has yet to be determined in the background of antivector immunity. When comparing the different CHIKV antigens tested, the data suggest that the full envelope gene cassette or the entire ORF expressing the structural genes that allow VLP formation yield the most-potent and most-protective vaccine candidates.
