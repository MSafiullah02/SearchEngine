These include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, are all members of betacoronavirus genus. SARS-CoV has about 80% sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2, whereas MERS-CoV has only about 50% sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2. These differences, as well as differences in the source of infection and cellular receptors for coronavirus, make the SARS outbreak a source of more relevant information to the COVID-19 pandemic than the MERS outbreaks. The other human coronaviruses, including the 2 alphacoronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and 2 other betacoronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) do not appear related to COVID-19, as these viruses continually circulate worldwide causing mild respiratory infections (\u201ccommon cold\u201d) in adults and children.",

They are rather large (120 nm), enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Their specific tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range are conferred by the spike protein, which interacts with a specific cell receptor. In the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the receptor for the virus is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, whereas for MERS-CoV, the receptor is DPP4/CD26 on nonciliated respiratory epithelial cells.",

They derive most likely from bats, the mammals with the highest diversity of coronaviruses. The transmission may have resulted through the intermediary of civets, the pangolin, or other animals. This is supported by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has a remarkable 96% genetic homology to a bat coronavirus,18 and a 99% sequence homology with a coronavirus from the pangolin species.6 MERS-CoV probably also originated from bats,17 but the intermediate hosts are dromedary camels. Camel to human transmission of MERS-CoV may occur through contact with camels, unpasteurized camel milk, and medicinal use of camel urine,19 but human to human transmission of the virus also occurs and has been documented in health care workers.20 MERS has a much higher case fatality rate (about 35% for the 2500 patients with clinical infections21\n,\n22). All 3 diseases (SARS, MERS, and COVID-19) have similar, but not identical, clinical manifestations, spanning the entire range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. COVID-19 presents more frequently with lower respiratory system symptoms, including chest tightness, dry cough, and dyspnea, and less commonly with gastrointestinal symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.",

A recent study showed that 0.2% of healthy adult blood donors in Saudi Arabia have specific antibodies against MERS-CoV, suggesting the existence of a large number of asymptomatic or mild infections, which may act as an unrecognized source of infection.22 Similar high numbers of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections have probably occurred during the SARS epidemic. Although the exact incidence of such asymptomatic infection remains unknown, a meta-analysis of SARS data showed overall seroprevalence rates of 0.1% for the general population and 0.23% for health care workers.23 It is therefore very likely that, when the dust has settled and serologic testing of populations exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is performed, we will realize than asymptomatic or subclinical cases of COVID-19 are much more common than clinical cases and may have played an important role in the spread of the disease.",

Compared with SARS, COVID-19 appears to be much more widespread but less deadly. The CFR of SARS was much higher than that of COVID-19, about 10% compared with 2.3% for COVID-19.16 The overall transmissibility of SARS was relatively low, with a R0 of around 3 (ie, 1 case would produce 3 secondary cases of disease in a susceptible community). This number was in large part determined by the much higher transmissibility in the hospital setting (R0 = 4), however. In the community setting, R0 of SARS was much lower, and may have even been less than 1, after the initiation of transmission control measures.24\n",

Nonetheless, 95% of patients who develop clinical disease do so within 12.5 days. The initial presentation is with fever (90%-96% of cases15) and mild to severe respiratory symptoms including cough in 70%, dyspnea in 45%, and muscle soreness or fatigue in 40%.15 Ten percent of patients or fewer have sore throat, headaches, or diarrhea.25 Imaging findings are usually those of pneumonia, with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in 97% of cases15 Compared with other pneumonias, COVID-19 pneumonia is more likely to have a peripheral distribution, ground-glass or fine reticular opacities, and is less likely to have a central involvement, pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy.26 Laboratory findings are nonspecific but usually include leukocytosis with lymphopenia, mildly increased liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, myoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase and increase in acute phase reactants. Increased procalcitonin, severe lymphopenia, and elevated D-dimers were features that correlated with more severe disease. In severe cases, the disease may progress to respiratory, circulatory, and renal failure, and ultimately death due to multiorgan failure.",

This gives the cytology laboratory an opportunity to re-evaluate their staffing needs and perhaps change the workflow. Measures may include working in shifts, and staggered meal breaks, to avoid contact between people, and having only the strictly necessary personnel in the laboratory. A paper from Singapore advises that laboratory personnel should record their temperature twice a day, to allow early identification of COVID-19, but in the current US context it is uncertain if this measure, and especially the ensuing measures, including viral testing, isolation, and quarantine measures, are feasible and practical. Clearly, any person having respiratory symptoms that could be caused by COVID-19 should not come to work and should instead consult their physician or health care professional. Emergency plans and contingency plans should be made for the possibility that a large proportion of the laboratory personnel has either fallen ill or is under quarantine. Communicating any changes or delays in service to the clinical service providers and departments is particularly important, to avoid overwhelming the laboratory with inquiries about test results.",

They consist of the presence of increased number of macrophages, forming loose macrophage aggregates. The macrophages may also show cytoplasmic changes, including the presence of foamy cytoplasm or larger cytoplasmic vacuoles or nuclear changes, including multinucleation and ground glass appearance of nuclei.42 Because bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is sometimes obtained for viral identification43, 44, 45 and is occasionally positive when nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples are negative,46 an aliquot may also be sent to the cytology laboratory. However, the cytologic findings of BAL samples of patients with COVID-19 are not yet reported. In patients with MERS, cytological examination of BAL fluid reportedly showed high numbers of neutrophils and macrophages.47 Based on the histopathology of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, BAL specimens may also show squamous metaplasia, and features of repair, together with the presence multinucleated cells and highly atypical alveolar type 2 pneumocytes showing cellular and nuclear enlargement, prominent nucleolim and chromatin clearing.34 These cytomorphologic features may represent a potential diagnostic pitfall.",

Although it is important to know which cytology specimens can contain viable and therefore transmissible virus, it is important to emphasize the use of universal standard precautions when dealing with any cytology specimen. From the experience with SARS we can extrapolate that SARS-CoV-2 can be present in fecal and urine samples, in addition to peripheral blood and respiratory samples. SARS-CoV-2 may be present in samples in patients without known COVID-19, in undiagnosed patients, in pre-symptomatic patients, in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections, and in convalescent patients, who may still be shedding the virus. From the available data it is very likely that many, if not most, infections occur through contact with individuals who either don't have the disease or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. In addition, as with most specimens, the clinical diagnosis may not be indicated in the requisition. For all these reasons, all fresh specimens should be considered potentially infectious.2.Special precautions should be taken in handling specimens for which the preparation involves steps that can lead to aerosol formation. All technical procedures should be performed in a way that minimizes the generation of aerosols and droplets. Preparatory steps that may generate aerosols or droplets include expelling aspirates from the needle or syringe; smearing the aspirated material; and potentially, air-drying or heat drying the smears, in which pathologists, trainees, or cytotechnologists may be involved during rapid on site evaluation (ROSE). Air-drying or heat drying of smears is best performed under Class II Biosafety Cabinets (BSC).51 Agitating the smears by hand or using hand-held fans to speed up the drying of smears should be avoided. ROSE is an important measure to ensure the adequacy of specimens. However, during an epidemic of a virus with respiratory-transmission, like SARS-CoV-2, clinical judgement should be used to determine whether ROSE is absolutely necessary for the success of the biopsy procedure.\n",

The anticipated shortage of facemasks and filter respirators52 makes a very selective use of this procedure important, as it is vital that we reserve this equipment for essential patient encounters and procedures. For similar reasons, it may be safer to suspend the activity of a pathologist-run fine-needle aspiration (FNA) clinic for the duration of the pandemic, and consider performing FNAs only on a case-by-case basis, weighing the risks and benefits of the procedure for each patient.",

All these cytopreparatory steps should be performed in class II BSC, providing protection for the user, the sample, and the environment. The use of PPE, including gloves, gown, and face shield, are also recommended for these procedures. Splash shields and sealed centrifuge rotors or sample cups are recommended for centrifugation; rotors and cups should be loaded and unloaded in a BSC.51\n3.The virus is inactivated by formalin and gamma irradiation. Therefore, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines,51 cytology laboratory activities, such as the pathologic examination and processing of formalin-fixed or otherwise inactivated tissues (cell block preparations), and the routine staining and microscopic analysis of fixed smears are assigned biosafety level 2. This is the typical biosafety level of all pathology laboratories and is assigned when working with agents associated with human diseases that pose a moderate health hazard or when working with any human-derived sample, including blood, body fluids, or tissue, in which the presence of an infectious agent is unknown. Most cytology specimens are fixed in either formalin or alcohol solutions with over 70% alcohol, which are considered effective to destroy this virus. It is not known whether fixatives using much weaker alcohol solutions, such as PreservCyt and CytoLyt (Hologic, Inc, Marlborough, MA) and SurePath (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) are adequately inactivating the virus. Therefore additional precautions, like the use of gloves, may be indicated while handling and interpreting cytologic preparations processed with these fixatives. Some pathologists may prefer using gloves for all their slides, since glass slides are touched by multiple hands until they reach the pathologist's desk, and cannot be easily decontaminated. Although dipping the slides in 95% alcohol (or similar) for a couple of minutes would inactivate the virus, it would also erase the marks (\u201cdots\u201d) on the slides. Other surface disinfectants, especially ones with short contact times, as mentioned later in this paper, can be tried to determine the practicality of their use on cytology slides.4.General safe laboratory practices, especially procedures that are basic to good microbiological practices and procedures, should be followed as recommended by the WHO53 and the CDC.51\n,\n54 This includes training all personnel in the use of the protective equipment, limiting access to the laboratory, frequent handwashing, and wearing PPE. Handwashing should be performed thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Alternatively, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 62% alcohol can be used, if soap and water are not available. The use of PPE includes wearing gloves for all procedures, wearing a buttoned lab coat or gown, eye protection and, when needed, wearing a mask. Touching mucosal membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth should be avoided. In addition, because the virus can remain viable on surfaces (especially plastic and stainless steel surfaces) for up to 72 hours,55 it is recommended to decontaminate all work surfaces multiple times per day, using Environmental Protection Agency\u2013approved disinfectant solutions, wipes, towelettes, or sprays. In addition to benches, this includes decontamination of computer keyboards, phones, and frequently touched areas of microscopes. The chemical substances involved include, among others, ethanol (minimum concentration of 62%-71%), 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium, sodium hypochlorite (0.1%), and a variety of acid solutions in various concentrations. These substances should be used with the manufacturer-recommended disinfection directions and preparations for human coronavirus and the recommended contact time (ie, the time the surface remains wet) which may range from 30 seconds to 10 minutes.56\n\n",

Sign-out with trainees could be performed on a digital platform such as Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc, San Jose, CA), although it might significantly slow the sign-out.

Therefore, during these unprecedented times, we have to constantly seek to improve the delivery of online training by keeping in touch with colleagues using similar technologies and adopting or adapting the strategies that work best. Seeking feedback from trainees is essential, not only to assess the impact of the online teaching, but also to get advice on the use of technologies that the trainees may be more familiar with.",

            "text": "It is important to address the fact that this epidemic will unavoidably generate stress, fear, and anxiety among all laboratory personnel, trainees and pathologists.57\n,\n58 Psychologic stress may be experienced differently by different people, and may be modulated by personal factors like age, sex, health status, baseline anxiety level, and risk perception. More severe psychologic distress may be followed by increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology.59 Psychological distress may be related to increased work load due to coworker absenteeism; lack of socialization with friends and colleagues; lack of recreational activities due to the closure of gyms, restaurants, movie theaters, and other recreational avenues; and increased family stress and parenting issues due to children being at home as a result of school closings. It may also relate to having a friend or family member affected by the disease. All health care workers may also feel anxious and stressed because of the fear of contracting the disease, fear of transmitting the disease to family members, or financial fears related to the changes implemented during this period. During this period, laboratory directors and other pathologists should be prepared to provide up-to-date information regarding the most recent developments in our knowledge about the disease and candid information regarding all aspects of the personnel's job. Although such information may also be available from a variety of sources, including the CDC and the health care center's Web site, in order to alleviate the fear and anxiety, it is important to have clear channels of communication, transmit the information in person, and respond to any questions that may arise. Providing emotional support and an opportunity to discuss any personal and family concerns is crucial during these times. It is very important to communicate effectively the risk to laboratory personnel and trainees, without overly reassuring them, and acknowledging that much is unknown about this infection. It is equally important to communicate any changes in policy or schedule as soon as possible.60 If physical meetings are not possible because of the social distancing measures implemented, Web-based conferences using a variety of platforms can be used. This can include SMS text messages, e-mails, using both institutional and personal e-mail, if needed, small group discussions, and Web sites, in addition to online discussion through apps such as Skype or Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Redmond, WA), FaceTime (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA), GoToMeeting (LogMeIn, Inc, Boston, MA), Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc), Webex (Cisco Webex, Milpitas, CA), and so on.",
