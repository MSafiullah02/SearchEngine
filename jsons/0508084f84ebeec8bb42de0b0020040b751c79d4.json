Pathogens for which there is more-compelling evidence of survival in environmental reservoirs include Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and pathogens for which there is evidence of probable survival in environmental reservoirs include norovirus, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus, and Candida species. Strategies to reduce the rates of nosocomial infection with these pathogens should conform to established guidelines, with an emphasis on thorough environmental cleaning and use of Environmental Protection Agency-approved detergent-disinfectants.",

For example, for one medical center, the decrease in environmental contamination that occurred after a move to a new hospital was not associated with any change in nosocomial infection rates [1] . Are organisms that are found in the inanimate environment \"innocent bystanders,\" or are they a source of patient colonization and infection?",

Last, observations from uncontrolled studies that outbreaks end following the implementation of improved environmental cleaning must be viewed critically, because the use of multiple infection-control mea-sures may obscure the importance of specific infection-control activities.",

The best studies of cross-colonization of patients from the inanimate environment use molecular epidemiologic techniques to identify pathogens, measure the quality of environmental cleaning and hand hygiene over time, and link contaminated surfaces and crosscolonization events in geographic and temporal dimensions.",

[3] . Similarly, parainfluenza virus is resistant to drying and can survive for 10 h on nonporous surfaces and for 16 h on clothing [5] . Human enteric viruses contaminate the inanimate environment and can cause institutional outbreaks [38] [39] [40] . Rotavirus is a well-known cause of outbreaks in day care centers and health care settings, extensively contaminates and survives on surfaces, and may spread after contamination of toys shared among children [38] . Norovirus has been the cause of outbreaks on cruise ships, in hospitals, and in hotels [7, 8, 39, 40] . In 2002, a total of 9 outbreaks of norovirus on cruise ships were reported [40] , and outbreaks occurred on consecutive cruises, despite attempts to disinfect the ships. For 3 of 5 ships on which the outbreaks occurred, discontinuation of service and aggressive cleaning and sanitation of the ship were required to stop the outbreaks. Although no conclusive proof exists of environment-to-person transmission of norovirus, the virus has been cultured extensively from samples obtained from the inanimate environment during outbreaks [8, 39] , and indirect evidence supports the idea that aerosolization of the virus can occur following emesis [8] .",

The virus has been found to survive for 24-72 h on plastered walls, plastic laminate surfaces (e.g., Formica, Formica Corporation), and plastic surfaces and is viable in excreted feces and urine for at least 1-2 days at room temperature [13] . An outbreak in an apartment complex in Hong Kong may have been the result of fecal-oral transmission combined with environmental contamination [15] , although the results of a modeling approach suggested an airborne mode of transmission [41] . Cleaning likely reduces surface contamination; an outbreak of cases in an emergency department in Taiwan was reported in which positive results of cultures of environmental samples obtained during the outbreak became negative after the emergency department was cleaned and the patients were isolated [12] .",

Surfaces may be durably contaminated, because experimental inoculation of dry surfaces shows that C. albicans and C. parapsilosis can survive for 3 days and 14 days, respectively [17] . Epidemic spread of Candida infection has occurred in which environmental sources (e.g., a blood pressure transducer or irrigating solution) were suspected [16, 42] . Evidence of an environmental reservoir of endemic C. albicans and C. glabrata has been suggested through the use of molecular typing of Candida isolates recovered from the environment and from patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation [16] . The strain types of Candida isolates acquired by patients were identical to those found on the hospital surfaces of rooms where the patients were housed, prior to patient acquisition of infection [16] .",

Contamination of the inanimate environment by C. difficile has been reported to occur in areas in close proximity to infected or colonized patients. Contamination rates have been as high as 58%; commonly affected surfaces and equipment include commodes, bedpans, blood pressure cuffs, walls, floors, washbasins, and furniture [18] [19] [20] . The organism has been found in low numbers on shoes and on stethoscopes [20] , and hospital floors have remained contaminated with C. difficile for up to 5 months [19] . The density of contamination is increased by the presence of colonized patients and patients with diarrhea [18, 20] . Molecular techniques provide the most concrete evidence of transmission of C. difficile from environmental surfaces to patients. The findings of a study of endemic C. difficile [18] were as follows: (1) C. difficile was present on the hands of health care workers, (2) there was a correlation between the degree of colonization of health care workers' hands and environmental contamination with C. difficile, and (3) there was differential contamination of the environment by individual strain types. Among colonized patients, a single, predominant isolate was found and was more likely to contaminate the environment than were isolates that sporadically colonized patients. This finding was reproduced in a study in which (1) despite endemicity of C. difficile, a single genotype predominated in the inanimate environment, and (2) the incidence of C. difficile infection correlated well with environmental contamination [44] . These data suggest that environmental surfaces serve as a reservoir that permits the cross-colonization of patients after they have had contact with a health care worker and that, in environments in which C. difficile is endemic, specific isolates likely predominate [18, 44] .",

The organism has been isolated throughout the inanimate environment-on the beds of colonized patients and on nearby surfaces (e.g., on mattresses and bedside equipment), in hospital rooms (e.g., on floors, sinks, countertops, and door handles), and in room humidifiers [24, 25] . Spread of A. baumannii via droplets has been suggested by the results of air sampling with culture plates [24] . Acinetobacter species are found in soil and water and may have adapted to survive for long periods, with reports of survival of up to 3 years in hospitals [26] .",

Sterilization destroys all microbial life on an object or surface and occurs through the use of heat, pressure, or chemical methods. Disinfection eliminates most microbes, excluding bacterial spores, and typically involves the use of chemical agents. The degree of destruction of organisms depends on their sensitivity to chemical disinfection. High-level disinfection involves the elimination of all but large quantities of spores, intermediate-level disinfection leads to destruction of all life except spores, and low-level disinfection will not reliably kill mycobacteria or spores. \"Cleaning\" is the process of removal of foreign material from a surface or object and may involve both mechanical processes and the use of detergents with water. Cleaning, alone, can reduce the organism load on a surface and, if used in conjunction with disinfection, may lead to significant reductions in organism load in shorter spans of time [62] . Three types of available solutions can be used during cleaning: detergents, which remove organic material and suspend grease or oil; disinfectants, which rapidly kill or inactivate infectious particles; and detergent-disinfectants, which achieve both aims. Conclusive data do not exist to prove that the routine disinfection of hospital surfaces is preferable to the use of detergent alone [63] , and, therefore, routine use of detergent-disinfectants is based largely on consensus and logistic considerations [4] .",

As a part of these recommendations, strategies for the cleaning of patient care areas were enumerated. The objective of cleaning efforts should be to keep surfaces visibly clean, to disinfect high-contact surfaces more frequently than non-high-contact surfaces, and to clean up spills promptly. For patient care areas, it is suggested that environmental services workers select Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered detergent-disinfectants to clean inanimate environmental surfaces. This is a controversial recommendation [63] , but the CDC/HICPAC guidelines note that this recommendation accommodates situations in which uncertainty exists regarding the nature of the contaminants on inanimate environmental surfaces (e.g., blood or body fluid contamination vs. routinely accumulated dust or dirt) or regarding the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms on such surfaces [4] . No specific recommendations were given regarding the frequency of cleaning, only that it should occur on a regular basis. In hospitals, patient rooms should be cleaned on a daily basis and undergo \"terminal cleaning\" after patient discharge from the hospital. During terminal cleaning, noncritical surfaces in the inanimate environment may be thoroughly cleaned using a disinfectant, typically a quaternary ammonium compound or phenolics (the latter is not advised for use in nurseries or infant care areas). Terminal cleaning may be more efficacious for degerming the environment because of its greater thoroughness.",

In a study of cleaning behaviors, constructive feedback given to housekeeping staff led to improved environmental cleaning and a 3-fold reduction in environmental VRE contamination.

The use of molecular epidemiology has helped to enhance understanding of the role of the environment in nosocomial infection by confirming that isolates in the environment either are the same as isolates recovered from patients (as shown for C. difficile, Candida species, or VRE) or differ (as shown in the case of Acinetobacter species). It is difficult, given the existing data, to draw conclusions from many existing outbreak reports or studies of the inanimate environment, because the levels of hand hygiene or environmental cleaning are rarely measured and may represent important confounders of the environment-transmission association. Studies conclusively demonstrating an improvement in nosocomial infection rates following improved cleaning need to be performed. Future studies to elaborate on the role of the inanimate environment must include measures of when, where, and how: in other words, when the environment was contaminated and patients acquired organisms; where the the patients were located during acquisition, with respect to contaminated rooms; and how well hand hygiene and environmental cleaning were practiced.",
