The two gap phases, G1 and G2, separate S phase, during which the DNA is replicated, and mitosis, in which it is divided between two new nuclei. After mitosis, the cell itself divides and each daughter cell begins the cycle again from G1, or exits the cell cycle into G0. Progression from one stage to the next is controlled by the activities of kinase complexes made up of cyclins bound to cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk). These complexes are in turn regulated by a multitude of pathways that allow response to external stimuli, e.g., via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, as well as to the internal conditions of the cell, e.g., via the checkpoint pathways.",

Although the Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex can enter the nucleus in G2, due to its fast rate of nuclear export it is predominantly cytoplasmic. In late G2, Cdc25C activates the kinase complex by dephosphorylating Cdk1. Inhibition of cyclin B1 nuclear export promotes the accumulation of the complex in the nucleus, where it stimulates entry into mitosis. Eventually the Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex is inactivated by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase that targets cyclin B1 for degradation. Without the activity of the APC, the cells are unable to exit mitosis. Passage through mitosis also requires that the mitotic spindle fibers attach to the chromosome via a complex of proteins called the kinetochore, and pull the sister chromatids apart. Successful G2/M transition and exit from mitosis are regulated by a multitude of other kinases and phosphatases, including protein phosphatase 2A, PP2A, which has multiple cell cycle targets and therefore pleiotropic effects on the cell.",

The pathways that monitor and induce G2 arrest under these conditions are examples of \u201ccheckpoints\u201d and result in the activation of the ATM and ATR kinases. Both ATM and ATR phosphorylate Chk1 and Chk2 leading to the activation of these kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of Cdc25C. The binding of 14-3-3 to phosphorylated Cdc25C sequesters this phosphatase in the cytoplasm, preventing it from activating the Cdk1/cyclin B1 complex. In addition to maintaining inactive Cdk1/cyclin B1 complexes, the checkpoint pathways can also prevent their nuclear accumulation. After the initial induction of G2 arrest, the arrest may be sustained via activation of other pathways that are typically regulated by p53. One regulator whose expression can be controlled by p53 is the p21 protein. By binding directly to Cdk/cyclin complexes, p21 is able to inhibit their kinase activity.",

This can result either from the induction of Cdk inhibitors such as p21, for example as occurs with JC polyomavirus agnoprotein (Darbinyan et al., 2002), or via maintenance of Cdk1 phosphorylation (Poggioli et al., 2001, Scarano et al., 1994), as proposed for the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 1 E4 protein (Knight et al., 2006). The mechanisms used by these viruses to mediate arrest appear to vary widely, and are not always fully understood, but it appears that in several cases, components of the DNA damage checkpoint pathways may be activated. Our current understanding of how these viruses achieve arrest is outlined diagrammatically in Fig. 1.",

The parvovirus B19 NS1 protein mediates G2 arrest despite the presence of active Cdk1/cyclin B1 in the cytoplasm (Morita et al., 2001). The NS1 protein has nicking and helicase activities that may damage cellular DNA (Momoeda et al., 1994, Poole et al., 2006), and although the precise mechanism of arrest is unclear, it may involve checkpoint pathways that regulate cyclin B nuclear export. An alternative strategy is used by the E4 protein of HPV16, which prevents the nuclear entry of the Cdk1/cyclin B complex by sequestering the Cdk1/cyclin B kinase complex in the cytoplasm (Davy et al., 2005). The association of HPV16 E4 with the cytokeratin network is thought to contribute to the ability of E4 to achieve this effect in vivo (Wang et al., 2004).",

The mechanisms that have been proposed to explain how Vpr expression may contribute to G2/M arrest include (1) Vpr binding to chromatin and/or splicing factors, which causes activation of ATR, and leads eventually to changes in the activity of the Wee1 kinase and/or the Cdc25 phosphatase (Lai et al., 2005, Terada and Yasuda, 2006); and the less well characterized phenomena of (2) direct binding to Cdc25C and inhibition of its phosphatase activity (Goh et al., 2004); (3) alteration of the level of Wee1 protein (Yuan et al., 2004); (4) effects on PP2A (Elder et al., 2001); (5) activation of the p21 promoter and p21-mediated Cdk1/cyclin B inhibition (Chowdhury et al., 2003); and (6) downregulation of expression of genes in the MAPK pathway (Yoshizuka et al., 2005) (see Fig. 1).",

Interestingly, HIV-infected T lymphocytes isolated from patients are arrested in G2 which may limit the immune response to the virus (Zimmerman et al., 2006).

            "text": "Using a variety of mechanisms, the expression of many cellular proteins has been found to fluctuate during the cell cycle. Virus-induced G2/M arrest may exploit these mechanisms of regulating protein levels within the cell, in order to control the expression of viral or cellular genes that are important for the completion of the virus life cycle. A specific example of this occurs during infection with the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus, where the levels of viral protein expression appear increased in G2/M (Dove et al., 2006). Although this correlates with an increase in virus progeny, the mechanism for the upregulated expression is not yet understood. In contrast, the expression of HSV1 late proteins appears dependent on Cdk1 activity, although evidence for increased protein synthesis in G2 remains to be tested (Advani et al., 2000). Enhanced expression of papillomavirus capsid proteins in the G2 phase of the cell cycle has recently been proposed for HPV6 and BPV1 (Kong-Nan Zhao, University of Queensland, Australia, personal communication). Mechanisms for increased protein expression may involve transcription and/or translation, and for viruses with RNA genomes, higher levels of transcription during G2/M might lead to the production of more viral genomes. HIV has been reported to be more transcriptionally active in G2 (Goh et al., 1998) and Vpr may also modulate translation via Cdk1/cyclin B1-induced changes in the activity of poly (A) polymerase (Mouland et al., 2002). Another way in which viruses make use of different cell cycle phases to regulate the extent of protein expression is via internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation. The IRES sequences from hepatitis C and encephalomyocarditis viruses appear to be downregulated in G2/M (Venkatesan et al., 2003), while that of HIV appears upregulated (Brasey et al., 2003).",

The continued replicative state can lead to an increase in viral genome copy number and to the replication of cellular DNA beyond 4n. This occurs during infections with murine and SV40 polyomaviruses (Lehman et al., 1994, Lehman et al., 2000), and following expression of the HPV type 31 E2 protein (Frattini et al., 1997).

It has also been observed in an organotypic raft culture system that recreates the HPV18 life cycle, that viral genome amplification occurs in cells that are in G2 in the absence of cellular DNA replication (Louise Chow, University of Alabama, Birmingham, USA, personal communication). Although the exact details of the life cycle and the mechanism of E4-mediated G2 arrest appear to vary somewhat between different papillomavirus types (see Fig. 2\n), knock-out experiments have demonstrated an important role for E4 in the amplification of viral genomes in the upper layers of infected epithelium (Nakahara et al., 2005, Peh et al., 2004, Wilson et al., 2005). In this instance, it is thought that E4 contributes to the elevated level of replication by stimulating a G2 arrest environment, which in the presence of E7 expression (and the stimulation of replication proteins) leads to the formation of a replication competent pseudo-S phase state. The mechanism by which E4, which acts at the G2/M boundary, and E7, which acts at the G1/S boundary are thought to work together during natural infection is shown in Fig. 2.",

Among more closely related virus groups we might expect to see greater similarities in the consequence of arrest. The potential benefit of maintaining a replicative state for viral DNA may explain why G2/M arrest in some form or another has been observed in the small DNA tumor viruses, adenovirus, HPV and polyomaviruses. Indeed all of these viruses have well-characterized proteins that can push cells out of G1 and into S phase; E1A (adenovirus), E7 (HPV), and large T (polyomaviruses). It will be interesting to see whether they all simultaneously express G2 arrest proteins during genome amplification in order to create a pseudo-S phase state.",

For example, HIV requires activation of a DNA damage response in order to efficiently integrate into the host cell chromosome (Daniel et al., 2005). By targeting early components of the checkpoint pathway, it may be that Vpr can simultaneously promote G2/M arrest, which increases levels of viral transcription, and activate the DNA repair mechanisms that are required for integration. By contrast, HPV type 16 does not require activation of the DNA damage response since its DNA is maintained as an extrachromosomal episome and therefore it can target cyclin B1 directly, which is a more downstream component of the G2/M pathway (see Fig. 2).",

Viral proteins may appear therefore to be acting through a number of regulatory pathways, when in fact their target is a common upstream event. In some cases of course, viral proteins may indeed have multiple targets, but there is still a need to distinguish events that lead to G2/M arrest from changes that ensue in the arrested cell. Cause and effect can be a particular problem in cell cycle experiments, where changes that might be expected to cause arrest (such as abnormal levels of Cdk/cyclin activity) may instead be the result of arrest by other mechanisms. The use of siRNA and/or cellular knock-outs has been proven a powerful technique for addressing this problem. Unfortunately, for the analysis of many cell cycle proteins this can be problematic, either because the results would be too detrimental to normal cellular proliferation or because of degeneracy among the activities of cell cycle control proteins. Cells may also react differently to viral proteins depending on when in the cell cycle these proteins are expressed, and this may cloud interpretation when cells are synchronized using drugs or other methods. The use of drugs to modulate specific cell cycle pathways can also be problematic, as many such drugs are known to exert pleiotropic effects on the cell (e.g., the use of okadaic acid to inhibit PP2A).",

For ease, experiments are often carried out in transformed cell lines but as these often exhibit abnormal cell cycle pathways, e.g., as a result of p53 deletions, the real effect of the viral protein may be masked. Ideally a number of cell types should be assayed, and the choice should reflect as far as possible the natural host of the virus, because different cell types respond differently to arrest stimuli. During our analysis of the mechanism of HPV16 E4-induced G2 arrest we have observed discrepancies between results obtained from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (a commonly used model system for cell cycle experiments) and those from mammalian cells (C.

The need to carefully interpret mutant data is further emphasized by the R80A G2 arrest mutation in Vpr. R80A does not bind to PP2A, but neither does it activate the p21 promoter, associate with Cdc25C, nor downregulate gene expression in the MAPK proliferation pathway, which makes functional interpretation of its significance particularly difficult.",

Although the outcomes of arrest are in general less well characterized than the mechanisms, a number of potential consequences have been identified. In some cases these do seem to be common to virus groups, such as the increase in viral genome copy number that is seen among some DNA viruses, but there is still much work to be done before the role of G2/M arrest in the life cycle of different viruses is properly understood. The most well-established mechanisms and outcomes are those that have been determined using a variety of approaches, and which make use of model systems that closely mimic natural infection. Hopefully by using such multi-faceted approaches, the mechanism of action, and the consequence of G2/M arrest can be established in the life cycle of the different viruses.",

The expression patterns of key HPV proteins including E7, which drives cells into S phase, and E4, which arrests cells in G2/M, are shown as vertical arrows adjacent to diagrammatic representations of infected epithelium. The images represent a model of the HPV life cycle, and are based on data presented in Middleton et al. (2003) and Peh et al. (2002). Initial infection occurs in the basal cells (purple) and expression of the viral E1 and E2 proteins facilitates replication of the viral episome. As the cells divide and leave the basal layer, they would normally become quiescent and differentiate but following HPV infection they can re-enter the cell cycle as a result of E7 expression. As the cells are pushed towards the epithelial surface the levels of E1, E2 and E4 expression increase, and the high levels of E4 protein cause the cells to arrest in G2. The continued expression of E7 in cells arrested in G2/M is thought to create a pseudo-S phase state, which facilitates viral genome amplification rather than cell proliferation. Active genome amplification ceases following the downregulation of E7, E1 and E2, and upregulation of the viral capsid proteins (L1 and L2). The timing of viral gene expression varies between HPV16 and HPV1 lesions but G2 arrest and amplification of the viral genomes occurs where the expression of E4 coincides with the expression of E7. The 1E4 protein is proteolytically cleaved during differentiation with the N-terminally truncated 16-kDa form, in addition to the full-length 17-kDa form, appearing to play a role in causing G2 arrest. Although proteolytic cleavage of HPV16 E4 occurs during differentiation, it is the full-length gene product that is responsible for growth arrest in G2. The HPV16 E4 protein prevents the nuclear accumulation of Cdk1/cyclin B1 that is required for mitosis by binding to the complex and tethering it to cytoplasmic keratins. This is illustrated to the left of the figure.",
