Therefore, some imaginable scenarios are made that deal with infected contacts.Transport by ambulance. All transport of infectious patients from the place of arrival to the hospital should take place in ambulances using the same infection control regime as for the individual infectious disease (contact infection, airborne infection, strict isolation); see isolation regimes; Chaps. 10.1007/978-3-319-99921-0_14\u201310.1007/978-3-319-99921-0_19 and chapter on transport of patients; 75. The infection regime should be in accordance with information/suspected findings and contact infection control personnel to ensure that this is the correct isolation level.Always use respiratory protection and PPE in case of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis and other highly infectious, severe diseases, and use a surgical face mask or respiratory protective device (P2-P3 mask without valve) on all patients with respiratory symptoms.\n",

            "text": "Example: person from Liberia visiting relatives in Oslo in spring 2014. Sick 10 days after arrival in Oslo. He attended a number of family gatherings. At the onset of disease (fever, respiratory symptoms and skin bleeding), he lived with a family of eight people in Oslo. Medical contact was taken after 3 days of illness. In all, there had been 20 contacts with the patient after he became ill, and before Ebola virus, infection was suspected. He was admitted directly to the isolate for airborne infections with direct access from outside. Ambulance staff was pre-equipped (PPE) for transport of patients suspected of VHF. The municipality\u2019s infection control doctor is notified and takes responsibility for the message, measures and follow-up outside the hospital together with the emergency preparedness group for the municipality.Unlikely in countries like Norway. However a verified Ebola patient was imported autumn 2014. The patient came to the country as a high-risk infection patient and treated as such at Ullev\u00e5l University Hospital, Oslo.Quarantine disease. Usually no more than one to two cases that (unexpectedly) get symptoms in Norway or while travelling to Norway. It is most likely that the symptoms come after arriving to Norway (2\u201321 days of incubation).Registration. Close contacts (name, address, telephone number and contact level with the patient). If sick on plane/boat/train, etc. to Norway, fellow passengers (same cabin/room/flight) must be registered.Ambulance personnel and other personnel use\u2014in suspicion\u2014infection control routines for VHF on contact and transport of the patient (see serious viral disease and personal infection prevention). Use respiratory equipment (P3 mask) and personal protective equipment (PPE), and put on a surgical mask on the patient.\nRemember! Once too much is better than once too little!\nRisk of spread of VHF. There is no significant risk of infection in Norway if the proper use of protective equipment is used when handling such patients. The Ebola outbreak in 3 African countries in 2014 showed that almost 30,000 were registered ill, more than 11,000 died, 800 health professionals became ill and more than half of them died. Lack of use of PPE and proper infection control led to escalation of the epidemic. The staff used only 1 m distance from the patient as a zone of infection, as recommended by the WHO and CDC, and lacked protection for the head, hair and neck when within the 1 m zone and used only ordinary masks [7\u201310]. This occurred despite the fact that Ebola is defined as a high-risk, biosafety level 4 infection in which airborne infection could be relevant [11\u201314]. The epidemic declined from 14 September 2014, following the introduction of more proper use of personal protection equipment and infection control routines [11, 12, 15].",
