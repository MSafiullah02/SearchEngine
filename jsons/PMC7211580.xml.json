Findings can support future palliative care guidance development for COVID-19 in nursing homes, by highlighting unaddressed topics that require urgent attention.\u2022Twenty-one documents (both international and country-specific) provided recommendations regarding palliative care in nursing homes in the context of COVID-19, albeit mostly with a very limited focus (e.g. regulating visits for dying residents, hospitalizations at the end of life).\u2022Key aspects of palliative care were largely unaddressed, including protocols for holistic assessment and management of symptoms and needs at the end of life (including stockpiling medications), education of staff concerning palliative care, referral to specialist palliative care or hospice, advance care planning communication, support for family including bereavement care, and support for staff.\n",

Eligibility of documents was evaluated independently by JG, LP and LVdB against inclusion criteria. In case of disagreement, decisions were discussed until consensus was reached. Excerpts were extracted by JG applying inductive bottom-up coding of common themes and performing content analysis using NVIVO (QSR) software. Initially coded themes (by JG) were discussed with LP and LVdB, after which a final coding instruction was prepared by JG. Final themes were reviewed and discussed by all authors to reach consensus. Results are reported using narrative synthesis techniques.",

Most recommendations concern very specific clinical tasks or subjects such as visits or hospital admissions, while several key aspects of palliative care, practical guidance, and broader structural and coordination considerations are largely absent [27]. International WHO guidance focused on infection prevention and control, body and funeral arrangements and respiratory symptom management only, while including limited recommendations on palliative care-related topics. Essential aspects of palliative care [6, 28] that were not fully addressed include: holistic symptom assessment and management at the end of life (including stockpiling medications and equipment), staff training (in particular for care assistants who deliver the majority of hands-on care in these settings) regarding communication, decision-making and comfort for dying residents, referral to specialist palliative care or hospice, comprehensive ACP communication (not limited to documentation), support for family including bereavement care, support for staff, and leadership and coordination related to palliative care [6, 8, 27, 28]. Documents also did not provide guidance on deployment of staff such as moving (palliative care) staff from acute settings to the community [6, 28].",

First, while most documents addressed early physical symptom management in COVID-19, only a few made specific recommendations regarding symptoms at the end of life. Non-physical (psychological, social or spiritual) needs were hardly addressed. Moreover, attention to dementia was limited to \u2018wandering\u2019 residents. This is an important omission given that the majority of nursing home residents have dementia, and the current crisis poses many challenges to them [29, 30]. Several Alzheimer\u2019s associations have started drafting COVID-19 guidance specifically for this population [31, 32], and future nursing home guidance should integrate this. Second, many documents highlight that the restriction of visits can be lifted for dying residents (although strict criteria apply) but fail to provide guidance on supporting family, especially regarding bereavement - even though measures, such as physical distancing, might negatively impact the grieving process [33]. Third, although it is remarkable that ACP is mentioned in many documents, it is discussed in a very limited way. The emphasis lies on treatment preferences in writing (i.e. do-not-hospitalize or DNR), while the actual communication process is less frequently mentioned [34].",
