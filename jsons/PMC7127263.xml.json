            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a multi-factorial disease complex that involves interactions among stressors, management factors, and viral and bacterial pathogens (Car et al., 1991, Hodgson et al., 2005, Ohmann and Babiuk, 1985). The main bacterial pathogen of BRD is Mannheimia haemolytica, which produces a potent leukotoxin that is its principal virulence factor (Fedorova and Highlander, 1997, Highlander et al., 2000). In its most severe manifestation, infection with M. haemolytica can cause fibrinous pleuropneumonia (Car et al., 1991, Hodgson et al., 2005, Loneragan et al., 2001, Ohmann and Babiuk, 1985, Yates, 1982). It is clear that in cattle, as in humans and other mammalian species, active viral infection dramatically increases susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. This has been demonstrated experimentally in cattle infected with any one of several bovine respiratory viruses such as bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) and bovine respiratory syncitial virus (BRSV), which renders them highly susceptible to challenge with M. haemolytica (Hodgson et al., 2005, Yates, 1982). In marked contrast, far greater numbers of M. haemolytica cells are required to cause pneumonia in the absence of viral infection, even when the bacterial cells are inoculated into a bronchus (Ohmann and Babiuk, 1985, Yates, 1982). These observations indicate that viral infection impairs host defense mechanisms against M. haemolytica, or amplifies undesirable aspects of the host response to this bacterial pathogen.",

However, it infects other cell types including bovine epithelial cells (Babiuk et al., 1996, Thaker et al., 1994). Thus, one might infer that the effects of BHV-1 on resistance to bacterial pneumonia are indirect and may result in part from epithelial cells releasing chemical mediators during viral infection (Babiuk et al., 1996, Brown and Shin, 1990, Leite et al., 2004a, Leite et al., 2004b, Raz et al., 1993). These mediators in turn can alter the activity of bovine neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes. For example, we demonstrated previously that exposure of leukocytes to BHV-1 virus -induced cytokines, alters leukocyte expression (or activation) of \u03b2-integrins in ways that increase their susceptibility to M. haemolytica leukotoxin (LKT) and their adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro (Rivera et al., 2009, Leite et al., 2004a, Leite et al., 2004b).",

Identifying underlying mechanisms responsible for the increased susceptibility of BHV-1 infected cattle to M. haemolytica has been difficult (Hodgson et al., 2005). A previous study used bovine microarrays and real-time PCR analysis to identify the genetic changes with enteric infections (by rotavirus and corona viruses) and respiratory infections by BHV-1 from intestinal loop tissue and monocytes from cattle (Wilson et al., 2005). We have reported that inflammatory cytokines released from BHV-1-infected BBE cells can alter the adherence and migration of bovine neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes (Rivera et al., 2009, Noel et al., 1988). In the present study, we employed a gene microarray strategy to investigate whether BBE cells respond differently to BHV-1and M. haemolytica, than to co-infection with either pathogen.",

Similarly, TNF and SLC2A3 (GLUT3) were also up regulated less by co-infection than by infection with M. haemolytica alone. TNF is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by and having a variety of effects on leukocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In regards to bronchial epithelial cells, TNF is a double edged sword in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. On one hand, it has a positive effect by promoting clearance of alveolar sac liquid and restoring the integrity of the endothelial barrier (Yang et al., 2010). Conversely it can interfere with tight junction integrity leading to increased permeability of alveolar epithelial cells and the capillary endothelium. A balance between these two functions influences the outcome of pulmonary infection (Yang et al., 2010).",

Such infections may be associated with gene expression profiles that promote pathogenesis of disease while the host counters by enhancing expression of genes that mediate protection mechanisms. The balance between these two responses governs the clinical outcome of the infection. Understanding the complex nature of factors contributing to tissue injury requires investigating multiple factors at a given point of time. Gene expression profiling is a useful method to achieve this goal.

Red indicates up-regulation while green indicates down- regulation of selected genes. (B) Multivariate pairwise correlation analysis of the BBE cell gene expression patterns elicited by BHV-1, MH, and BHV-1 + MH. This analysis provides a more quantitative examination of similarities in expression patterns of the differentially expressed genes by determining the correlation between gene expression (as fold change) and significance (p < 0.05) profiles of the genes differentially regulated by all treatments. This analysis indicates that the responses elicited by MH are highly correlated with gene expression patterns for BHV-1 + MH.",
