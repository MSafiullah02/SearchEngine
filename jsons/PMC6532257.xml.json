            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was first observed in isolates of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples collected from children with lower respiratory tract infection during the 1990s in Netherlands [1]. It is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, and the first member of the new Metapneumovirus genus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family that infects humans [2]. HMPV is a causal agent of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in primarily children [3]. The virus causes substantial morbidity especially in the extremes of age and in the immunocompromised [4]. For instance, in hospitalized patients younger than 5 years of age, 5-7% of acute respiratory infections worldwide can be attributed to hMPV [5]. At the clinical level, hMPV is associated to several diseases including bronchitis, croup, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma exacerbations, specifically in children less than 5 years of age [6]. Despite the growing burden of diseases imputed to this pathogen, there is no specific prophylactic vaccination strategy in place although various vaccine candidates are currently under investigation [7]. In addition, little is known about the epidemiology of this virus, especially in low income countries due to the low availability of molecular diagnostic tools.",

Senegal, a country with around 16 Million people and situated in the western part of Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Sahel, had a National Influenza Center since 1974. The NIC is hosted at the Institut Pasteur Dakar (IPD) and had been part of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance Network since 1996 [8]. The purpose of this influenza surveillance has traditionally been the early detection of influenza epidemics in the community, the identification of predominant circulating influenza strain, and the issuing of public health recommendations. In 2012, the network has been consequently enhanced with epidemiological data collection, additional sentinel sites, and virological surveillance extended to other respiratory viruses diagnosis [9].",

The discrepancies in HMPV detection rates among patients with ILI in different areas highlighted geographical differences in virus burden.

The non detection of HMPV in this age group would be probably due to the low number of patients (3.5% of overall patients) from this group as a previous study exclusively focused on the elderly revealed a HMPV detection rate of 3.3% [9]. In our study, the majority (71.8%; 221/308) of HMPV-positive patients were children between 0 to 5 years old, with more than the half of them under 1 year age (55.7%, 123/221). Consistent with our findings, several studies have reported this sensitivity of children under 5, especially in the first year life, to HMPV infection [22\u201324]. This highest prevalence in children is believed to be due to a naive immune system for most of HMPV genotypes in early childhood. The bias in the composition of our study population (nearly 50% of children under 5) is another factor that would have accentuated the trend noted. No influence of the patients\u2019 gender on HMPV infection was observed in our study, which is consistent with the results of a study in China [25]. However, sex discrimination had been previously reported [26, 27]. Our findings regarding Influenza, HAdV and HRV as the most frequently co-detected viruses with HMPV were similar to those of Kong et al. [25]. Fever, cough, myalgia, and headache were the predominant clinical features associated with HMPV detection, which is in line with results from a study conducted in China [28].",

The circulation pattern of the HMPV between 2012 and 2015 is also similar to that of RSV in the same period [31].

The low sensitivity of conventional PCR compared with real time PCR on samples with low viral load, and certainly non-specific amplifications could be the cause of these failures. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated co-circulation of mainly three HMPV subgroups A2, B1 and B2. A similar genotypic composition has been observed in several other studies [13, 32, 33]. And as in other studies conducted in Saudi Arabia [26], in Croatia [34], in Panama [24] or in Kenya [32], we have no strain belonging to genotype A1, supporting the idea that old lineages have been replaced by emerging genetic strains. Indeed, the A2c subgroup was present in Senegal throughout the study period, except in 2014 where it was not detected probably due to a non-exhaustive sequencing. The A2c genotype was the dominant circulating genotype in 2012\u20132013 periods, and then B1 in year 2014 where all the sequences obtained belonged exclusively to genotype B. However, in 2015 we observed a co-circulation of 4 genotypes with a predominance of subgroup B2 while A2c subgroup dominated in 2016. These results, despite the small number of sequenced strains, confirm previous observations on the changes and predominance of circulating HMPV genotypes [35].",

So the sequencing results do not reflect the full spectrum of HMPV genotypes that may circulate in ILI patients in Senegal, and even for selected samples it may have a bias toward samples with a high viral load. Also it would be interesting to analyze G gene region coding for attachment proteins for more acuity on the genetic variability of circulating strains. Secondly, in our study only outdoor patients were recruited. Thus further studies including both outpatients and inpatients (hospitalized) would be required to firmly establish the burden associated with HMPV in Senegal and correlations between disease severity and genotypes.",

Globally our results showed a clear seasonal pattern of HMPV in the second half of each year, between June and October with a possibly extending into November. Our findings also identified children less than 5 years old as being more susceptible to HMPV infection. Molecular studies identified A2, B1 and B2 as the major genotypes circulating. However, additional sequencing work targeting both G and F genes should be carried out in order to enhance understanding of the local and global molecular epidemiology of HMPV strains from Senegal. The next step will be the the HMPV burden assessment in Senegal, especially in pediatric hospitalized cases. Data on disease outcome, atypical clinical signs, viral load, shedding, duration of symptoms, duration of hospitalization and treatment will be collected and included in analyses.",
