Canaries have been domesticated since 1400, and are bred and kept for different reasons: their song (e.g. the Roller canary, the Harzer, Waterslager, Timbrado or the American Singer); as coloured canaries, including the melanin (black, brown, agate, isabel) and lipochrome (red, yellow, white) groups; their build and shape like type canaries, including frilled canaries, e.g. North Dutch frill and Gibber Italico; type breeds, e.g. Japan Hoso, Yorkshire; shape breeds, e.g. Border Fancy and Norwich; crest and crest bred, e.g. Gloster; and feather pattern, e.g. Lizard, the oldest true breed canary (Coutteel 2003) (Fig. 8.1\n). The black-hooded red siskin (Spinus cucullatus) is the source of the red pigment that is added to the canary\u2019s genetic make-up, and is clearly in evidence in the red canary. The birds live approximately 6\u201316 years, are monomorphic and weigh 15\u201325 g. This longevity related to the small body size is typical for songbirds. Within the large songbird family Fringillidae (true finches), and especially the canary, mass-specific basal metabolic rates, longevity, longevity residuals and lifetime expenditure of energy are all positively correlated with the rate of cytochrome b evolution (Rottenberg 2007).",

There is a significant size disparity between the common finch pets (the smallest is the gold-breasted waxbill at 7 g, the largest is the Java rice sparrow at 20 g). Most common finches belong to the families Fringillidae and Estrildidae. Examples of commonly kept Fringillidae (true finches, approximately 150 species) are canaries (Serinus canaria), greenfinches (Carduelis chloris), goldfinches (C. carduelis), siskin (C. spinus), bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) and chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs). Estrildidae (approximately 125 species) originating from Africa, Asia and Australia include waxbills, e.g. zebra finch (Poephila guttata) and Lady Gouldian or Gouldian finch (Chloebia gouldiae), nuns, e.g. spice finch (Lonchura punctulata), and parrot finches, e.g. the parrot finch (Erythrura psittacea). The finches are kept for breeding, but also as ornamental birds. Bengalese or society finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and zebra finches are used as foster parents for breeding Australian finches. This gives special problems, because they can be carriers of diseases that can kill the foster-fledglings \u2013 e.g. cochlosomosis and Campylobacter spp. infections. Conversely, using foster parents may prevent some infectious diseases that are transmitted from infected parent to offspring. For example, colonies of Gouldian finches that are air sac mite-free have been established by using society finches, which are not susceptible to air sac mites, as foster parents (Macwhirter 1994). One of the major disadvantages of fostered birds is that they imprint on the foster parents, and may therefore be less likely to breed with their own species. For species-specific imprinting to occur, a finch should be exposed to its own species from the fifteenth to the fortieth days of life.",

The birds are in the aviary all year, with a shed for shelter and a flight outside. Planted aviaries are popular for these passerines, because the vegetation provides observers with a more natural view of a bird\u2019s behaviour (Fig. 8.7\n). Planted aviaries can cause problems when trying to control microorganisms and medicate diseased birds (Macwhirter 1994). These plantings, however, are often necessary to get breeding results. For feather care in mixed ornamental aviaries, the birds should have access to water and/or sand-baths. In breeding aviaries, the housing depends on the season. Today, canaries are mostly bred indoors, and during the breeding season the birds are generally maintained as couples in small box-type cages approximately 50\u00d740\u00d740 cm (Fig. 8.8\n). Normally the fancier allows the birds to lay two to three clutches using artificial lighting (Fig. 8.9\n). The weanlings are housed in communal flights, with or without outside quarters. In the winter season (resting season), the males and females are housed as separate groups in pens. Singing canaries are housed individually in small sing-cages (21\u00d720\u00d715 cm) for more than 5 months to be trained and enter singing competitions. The breeding aviaries are relatively easy to clean.",

If artificial light is produced for breeding birds, the kind of radiation produced by the lamps is an important factor, including such aspects as luminance, frequency and colour temperature (Coutteel 2003).",

It will take a period of 2\u20133 months to increase from an 8-hour natural day length to a 15-hour day, increasing at 2\u00d715 minutes per week. A minimum luminance of 500\u20131000 lux is needed, preferably using a dimmer to simulate dawn and twilight.3.Introducing an immediate full day length, extending it from 10 to 15 hours.

Yeasts and protozoal cysts (e.g. Giardia spp.) are found using direct wet preparations or flotation techniques. The diagnosis of cochlosomosis in society finches or Australian finches can only be made in direct wet mounts of fresh and warm stool without dilution. Passerine species are not considered to have a permanent gut flora, so minimal bacteria and/or other microorganisms should be found in stained faecal smears. Routine microbiological aerobic cultures should be negative. Microaerophylic strains (e.g. Campylobacter jejuni) can be found in stained faecal smears in many Estrildidae. In softbills, bacteria are commonly demonstrated in the stools of healthy birds and are considered as \u2018passage flora\u2019.2.Crop swabs. These are essential for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis, infections with other flagellates, and crop candidiasis.3.Blood samples. For additional information in small individual passerine birds, blood can be collected in heparinized capillary tubes after puncturing the medial metatarsal vein. In softbills, blood normally is collected from the right jugular vein. One drop is used for a blood smear, which can be examined for blood parasites. The packed cell volume (PCV) normally ranges from 40% to 55%; a reading of less than 35% indicates anaemia. Total protein (TP) is a significant diagnostic measure. For the serological diagnosis of paramyxovirus infections or toxoplasmosis, 0.5\u20131.0 mL of blood can be collected from the right jugular vein. As with other avian species, no more than 1% of the body weight in blood volume should be collected at one time, less in a critically ill bird.\n",

Besides the ratio of feathers to whole body mass, feather length as well as featherweight were of interest. Furthermore, data on feather loss and growth rates were estimated. In general, it could be observed that the proportion of feathers relative to body mass varied between 14% (canaries) and 7.4% (lovebirds). Feather losses (outside the moult period) amounted to an average of 6.65 (canaries), 8.98 (budgerigars), and 8.43 (lovebirds) mg/bird/day respectively or 37 (canaries), 20 (budgerigars), and 17 (lovebirds) mg/100 g body weight/day (values of interest in calculating of protein requirements for maintenance). In canaries, the average growth rate of the developing feathers amounted to 2 mm/day. In contrast to the onset of feather regeneration, the growth rate of new feathers leaving the follicle was not influenced by the supplements used here. The regeneration period (first measurable feather growth) of a plucked pinion can be used as an indicator and objective parameter to test potential nutritional influences. Parallel to the improvement of nutrient supply the rates of feather losses and also replacement increased, whereas the rates decreased when seed mixtures without any addition of minerals, sulphurous amino acids, and vitamins were fed (Wolf et al 2003).\n",

All birds then were fed a low-iron diet (32\u201348 ppm) and assigned to four treatment groups: (1) low-iron diet only, (2) low-iron diet with phytate (inositol) and tannic acid, (3) low-iron diet and deferoxamine (100 mg/kg s.c. q24h), and (4) low-iron diet and phlebotomy (1% of body weight q7d). Starlings were treated for 16 weeks. In the groups treated with phlebotomy or with deferoxamine and a low-iron diet, non-haem liver iron concentrations decreased to safe levels after 16 weeks of treatment at similar rates (190 ppm/week and 163 ppm/week, respectively). The low-iron diet alone reduced stored liver iron levels at a slower rate (45 ppm/week). The addition of inositol and tannic acid to the low-iron diet had no impact on stored liver iron concentrations. These results suggest that both phlebotomy and treatment with deferoxamine are effective treatment options for birds with iron storage disease (Olsen et al 2006).\n",

At necropsy, the extremely haemorrhagic, oedematous lungs are characteristic.\n4.Avocado, or at least certain varieties, may be toxic to some passerines. Post-mortem findings in intoxicated birds include hydropericardium and subcutaneous oedema in the pectoral area (Hargis 1989).5.Green almonds have been considered as a cause of mortality in American goldfinches, presumably from cyanide released by hydrolysis of amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside.6.Ethanol toxicity has been reported in free-ranging passerines (especially cedar wax-wings) following the ingestion of hawthorn apples or other fruits that have frozen and then thawed, allowing yeast fermentation of sugars to produce ethanol. Birds are lethargic, ataxic, or may be in a stupor (\u2018drunk\u2019). Many intoxicated birds die from accidents that occur while they are \u2018flying under the influence\u2019. The diagnosis is based on analysing crop contents and liver for ethanol concentrations (Fitzgerald et al 1990).7.Heavy metal toxicosis caused by the direct consumption of the metal is uncommon in passerines, because they have limited capacity to damage metal objects. Lead or zinc toxicosis has occasionally occurred when galvanized wire has been used in the construction or repair of enclosures. Another source of zinc for passerine species is galvanized containers for supplying bath or drinking water.

A different circovirus was isolated from another passeriform species, the Australian raven (Corvus coronoides), with feather lesions similar to those that occur in psittacine beak and feather disease. Comparison with other members of the Circoviridae demonstrated that raven circovirus RaCV shares the greatest sequence homology with CaCV and PiCV and is more distantly related to the PBFDV, GCV, duck circovirus and the two porcine circoviruses (Steward et al 2006).",

In canary nestlings showing the so-called \u2018black spot\u2019, which is a gall bladder congestion, a circovirus has been demonstrated at electron microscopy, but a cultivation and infection trial were negative (Goldsmith 1995). In another report multiple cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed in the intestinal smooth muscle cells of an adult canary from an aviary with a history of high mortality (50%) both in adult and young birds. Grossly, a mild enteritis was the only lesion appreciable. Smears of the proventricular contents contained a few gastric yeasts (Macrorhabdus ornithogaster). The intestinal inclusions were found in very high numbers in all parts of the tract examined. Inclusions of the same type were occasionally detectable in the wall of a few splenic and pancreatic arteries. No inclusions or lesions were seen in the other organs examined. Transmission electron microscopy of the intestinal wall revealed circovirus-like particles either in paracrystalline arrays or loose arrangements, mostly within the cytoplasm of the intestinal muscle cells. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis confirmed infection with canary circovirus (Rampin et al 2006).",

The ability of the invading NY99 strain of WNV to elicit an elevated viraemia response in Californian passerine birds is critical for the effective infection of Culex mosquitoes. Of the bird species tested, Western scrub jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens, produced the highest viraemia response, followed by house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, and house sparrows, Passer domesticus. Most likely, few mourning doves (Zenaidura macroura) or common ground doves (Columbina passerine) and no California quail, Callipepla californica, or chickens would infect blood-feeding Culex mosquitoes. All Western scrub jays and most house finches succumbed to infection (Reisen et al 2005). House finches and English sparrows are competent hosts for both West Nile and St Louis encephalitis viruses and frequently become infected during outbreaks.

An avian influenza A virus of the subtype H7N1 was isolated in summer 1972 from a single free-living siskin (Carduelis spinus Linnaeus, 1758). Additional cases of morbidity or mortality were not observed in the area were the sick siskin was found. The virus induced following experimental inoculation of chicken embryos a high rate mortality (mean death time approximately 24 hours). This virus was considered as a highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus. Canaries that were housed in the same room with the siskin were accidentally exposed by contact to the sick siskin, which resulted in virus transmission followed by conjunctivitis, apathy, anorexia and a high rate mortality (Kaleta & H\u00f6nicke 2005). The role of passerines in the spread of avian influenza A is, however, negligible. A total of 543 migrating passerines were captured during their stopover on the island of Heligoland (North Sea) in spring and autumn 2001. They were sampled for the detection of avian influenza A viruses (AIV) subtypes H5 and H7, and for avian paramyxoviruses serotype 1 (APMV-1). For virus detection, samples were taken from (a) short-distance migrants such as chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs, n=131) and song thrushes (Turdus philomelos, n=169), and (b) long-distance migrants such as garden warbler (Sylvia borin, n=142) and common redstarts (Phoenicurus phoenicurus, n=101). Virus detection was done on conjunctival, choanal cleft and cloacal swabs. In none of the tested samples was AIV detected. Six out of 543 birds (1.1%) were found to carry non-pathogenic and lentogenic strains of APMV-1. This indicates that the passerine species examined in this study may play only a minor role as potential vectors of APMV-1 (Schnebel et al 2005). In another study 413 free-living migrating passerines from 37 different species were caught in the autumn of 2004 in Slovenia and cloacal swabs taken and processed by RT-PCR and virus isolation. Only one sample from a common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) by RT-PCR was positive for AIV, but negative for H5 and H7 (Ra\u010dnik et al 2007).",

This was the first time that USUV had emerged outside Africa and caused fatalities in warm-blooded hosts. Although retrospective examination of blackbird tissues suggested introduction of USUV into Austria already 1 year earlier (in 2000), there were no reports of bird die-offs that year (Weissenb\u00f6ck et al 2002). In the following years there was an increase in the number of diagnosed cases with a maximum of 91 cases in 2003. In 2005 only 4 cases were diagnosed in Austria. The major macroscopic finding was hepatosplenomegaly; histologically, neuronal necrosis, myocardial lesions and coagulative necrosis of the liver and spleen were observed. The diagnosis is confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in-situ hybridization (ISH) (Chvala et al 2004). Until 2006 the virus was only found in Austria (Bakonvi et al 2007).In the summer of 2006 unusual bird mortalities were reported at Zurich Zoo, including wild blackbirds, wild sparrows (Passer domesticus) and captive Strigidae (more than 90 birds). Neuronal necrosis was the most prevalent finding in pathohistological examinations. In the same period a great grey owl (Strix nebulosa) originating from northern Italy, in the middle of a triangle formed by Milano, Como and Lecco, died and was histopathologically examined. The bird was captive bred and came from a large breeding collection of many different Strigiformes. The breeder was losing great grey owls and hawk owls (Surnia ulula) after a short period (a few days) of disease. The main pathological finding at necropsy was a hepatomegaly with congestion. By immunohistochemistry large amounts of USUV antigen were found in many different organs. This finding was confirmed by PCR and sequencing of amplification products (Dorrestein et al 2007).\n",

Until recently it was not possible to culture the organism. In canaries, infection caused by these organisms in the proventriculus is common, and is predominantly found on the mucosal surface and in the ducts of the glands. Macrorhabdus colonization of the proventriculus in companion birds is not always associated with clinical signs or pathological lesions (De Herdt et al 1997). In one study, 22.9% of Psittaciformes (35.8% in budgerigars) and 19% of Passeriformes (only 16.7% in canaries) demonstrated a positive proventriculus at necropsy for these organisms (Ravelhofer et al 1998). In a more recent study in Belgium there was an increasing incidence of Macrorhabdus in canaries (Marlier et al 2006). At the time of death, macrorhabdiosis was diagnosed in 28% of canaries and 22.5% of budgerigars, but was not diagnosed in parrots.

Atoxoplasmosis is a disease of young canaries ranging in age from 2 to 9 months. The clinical signs include huddling and ruffling of the feathers, debilitation, diarrhoea, neurological signs (20%) and death. Mortality can be as high as 80%. An enlarged liver may be observed as a blue spot on the right side of the abdomen caudal to the sternum, referred to by fanciers as \u2018thick liver disease\u2019 (Fig. 8.34\n). At necropsy, an enlarged and sometimes spotted liver (with necrosis in the acute phase) is noted, along with a huge, dark-red coloured spleen (see Fig. 8.4) and, often, an oedematous duodenum with vascularization. In the imprints of the liver, spleen and lungs, parasites are found in the cytoplasm of the monocytes. The nucleus of the host cell is crescent-shaped (see Fig. 8.17). Coccidia are seldom found in the faeces or intestinal contents because, after the acute phase is passed, only a few coccidia (100\u2013200/24 hours) are excreted. The therapeutic agent of choice is sulphachlorpyrazine (150 mg/L drinking water) until after moulting for 5 days a week. This treatment affects the production of oocysts, but does not influence the intracellular stages.",

In canaries this phase is often not diagnosed, and the owner is only alarmed when several birds become blind many weeks after becoming infected. In a flock many birds were affected with blindness, which developed over a 3-month span, and two birds developed torticollis. The route of infection is not known, but it is likely that oocysts excreted in cat faeces get into the aviary. In the acute phase, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, and mostly a severe catarrhal pneumonia and a myositis of the pectoral muscle, are found in canaries and mynahs at necropsy. The trophozoites are easily identified in impression smears. Microscopic alterations within the eye consisted of a non-suppurative chorioretinitis with large numbers of macrophages that contained the tachy-zoite form of Toxoplasma gondii in the subretinal space, and aggregates of tachyzoites were found in the nerve fibre layer of the retina with and without necrosis. Tissue cysts with bradyzoites were scattered throughout the meninges and neuropil of the cerebrum and cerebellum (Williams et al 2001). In histological slides from the brains, (pseudo)cysts are relatively easy to find. Serology, immunofluorescence on brain tissue slides, or infection of mice confirms the diagnosis. The Sabin\u2013Feldman dye test will not detect T. gondii antibodies in the serum of birds (Patton 1996). No effective treatment is known, although some effect is claimed using trimethoprim 0.08 g/mL H2O and sulfadiazine 0.04 g/mL in water for 2 weeks.

However, the factors causing this variation are still poorly understood. We assessed the statistical effects of biogeographic, plumage-related and life-history traits on the prevalence of the blood parasites (e.g. Plasmodium spp., Haemoproteus spp., Leucocytozoon spp. and Trypanosoma spp.) in European passerine birds. Most of the variation in parasite prevalence occurred at low taxonomic levels. Brighter male plumage and greater host body mass were associated with higher prevalence, explaining 32% of the total variation. Male plumage brightness remained a significant factor when we controlled for phylogenetic effects. These relationships were driven primarily by simuliid-transmitted parasites (e.g. Leucocytozoon spp., Trypanosoma spp.), which were more frequent in species with northern distributions. Host species with greater maximum longevity and shorter nestling periods had higher prevalences of Plasmodium spp.; however, the effect was not stable after controlling for phylogeny using pairwise contrasts. Coevolution between hosts and parasites appears to create temporal and spatial variation that disconnects haematozoan prevalence from evolutionarily conservative life-history traits while creating some positive associations with traits that are phylogenetically labile. Clearly, ecologists should be cautious in relating patterns of variation in haematozoan prevalence to particular host traits (Scheuerlein & Ricklefs 2004).\n",

The throat of the bird must be wetted (e.g. with alcohol) and the feathers parted. Post-mortem examination, however, is more reliable, and the condition is diagnosed by finding in the mites in the air sacs, the lungs and/or the trachea. Air sacculitis, tracheitis and focal pneumonia may be evident.",
