            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a principal cause of excess hospitalisation and mortality worldwide [1], [2], [3]. Historically, the overriding clinical approach to the management of CAP has been to focus on bacterial aetiologies, with Streptococcus pneumoniae the dominant pathogen [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. More recently, coupled to the increasing availability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the identification of viral pathogens in the aetiology of CAP has increased. Contemporary studies identify that viruses may be implicated in 15%-30% of all CAP [9], [10], [11]; in turn this heightens the possibility that empirical antibiotic treatment of CAP in the absence of adequate testing for viral pathogens may contribute to inappropriate antibiotic usage [12], [13].",

We awarded zero or one star in each domain; for representativeness, one star was awarded for studies sampling from the general community (as opposed to more specialised patient subgroups); for ascertainment of CAP diagnosis we awarded one star for independent radiographic confirmation of diagnosis; and for virus aetiology, one star for use of \u2018gold standard\u2019 PCR diagnostic techniques.",

In 10 (35.7%) studies (9 publications) respiratory tract sampling was combined with assessment of paired serology [25], [31], [32], [33], [45], [46], [49], [50], [51].; and in four (14.3%) studies, serology alone was performed [27], [29], [37], [40].",

Overall our data suggest that respiratory viruses are detectable in at least 22% of radiologically confirmed CAP cases, mostly hospitalised cases. However significantly higher proportions of respiratory viruses were evident in studies conducted after 2010 (27%), studies that included viral PCR techniques (29%), and studies assessed to be at lower risk of bias (29%), suggesting that the true proportion of CAP associated with respiratory viruses is at least one quarter (25%). Our findings accord with recent major studies or reviews conducted in Asia and North America [11], [14], [52], [53]. In the CDC EPIC study [11], viruses were detected in 27.0% of adult patients with CAP, while Qu et al. detected viruses in 27.5% of Asian patients with CAP [51].",

            "text": "Our review suggests that in Europe, as in other parts of the world, a relatively large burden of CAP disease may be attributable to viral infections. However, the clinico-pathological significance of virus detection in patients with CAP remains uncertain. A clear limitation of our approach (and of each of the included studies) is that no proof is offered that the virus or viruses identified were of pathological significance in all cases. There was also heterogeneity between studies in terms of the respiratory sites sampled and/or use of serology. Viruses recovered from upper respiratory tract (URT) sites might have less pathological significance than those recovered from lower respiratory tract (LRT) sites; nevertheless, in the absence of concomitant sampling from URT and LRT it is not possible to disregard viruses identified from URT sites which may have been replicated in the LRT if it had also been sampled. Whilst respiratory viruses are undoubtedly implicated in the aetiology of a substantial proportion of the cases in which they are detected, asymptomatic illness associated with virus shedding is well recognised, especially in children who experience longer periods of shedding than adults [54]. In addition, modern PCR diagnostic techniques are comparatively more sensitive than methods for the detection of bacteria, and capable of detecting small quantities of nucleic acid which may not in all cases represent culturable virus; therefore, some patients with \u2018viral-only\u2019 pathogens identified may also have a microbiologically unrecognised bacterial infection; and some detections of viral pathogens may represent previous or resolved virus infection. In a recent study, Gadsby et al. employed PCR techniques to identify bacteria as well as viruses from lower respiratory tract samples, viruses were detected in 30% of 323 adults admitted to hospital with CAP and a co-bacterial pathogen was detected in 82% of these [55]. In contrast, we noted only 10% of cases with a bacterial co-pathogen; this might reflect the use of PCR testing for bacteria by Gadsby and colleagues, whereas the studies we included used standard approaches for the identification of bacteria. The detection of respiratory viruses in healthy asymptomatic individuals is not as extensively described as in symptomatic patients; nevertheless Jartti and colleagues summarised data from 51 studies, noting maximum baseline prevalences of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic subjects as follows: rhinoviruses, 15%; adenoviruses, 5.3%; influenza, 4.3%; RSV, 2.6%; coronaviruses, 2.5%; eneteroviruses 1.2%; human bocavirus, 1.1%; parainfluenza, 0.9%; and hMPV, 0.6% [54]. Jansen and colleagues have observed that rhinovirus is extremely common in asymptomatic children (28%), but that if other viruses are identified, notably RSV, adenoviruses and hMPV, these are much more likely to be clinically relevant56; this may be different in adults. We lacked direct comparison with any such \u2018asymptomatic control\u2019 group in the included studies, nor did we have access to data on the host response to viruses in individual subjects. However separate studies in asymptomatic patients [54], [56] offer important contextualization for our findings; and inclusion of an asymptomatic comparator group would be likely to add granularity in future studies.",

Influenza appears to be the most significant virus pathogen, followed by rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. Notwithstanding, different included studies tested for between 4 and 11 separate respiratory viruses (Table 1); if all included studies had tested for all 11 viruses the overall proportion of virus detection may well have been considerably higher, although, as discussed above, not all detections necessarily have clinical relevance to CAP. This potential source of bias will not have affected the estimates for individual viruses (Table 2) because these analyses were organism-specific and based on all available data by organism. Viral diagnostic evaluation of CAP facilitates greater precision in the assessment of illness severity, and the tailoring of therapy, in particular the rapid use of neuraminidase inhibitors for cases of influenza and more judicious use of antibiotics. Since there are realistic near-term prospects for novel antiviral treatments for several respiratory virus infections and RSV vaccines [59], [60], [61], there is a need to establish baseline data on the incidence of viral CAP and develop a wider culture of testing for respiratory virus pathogens without which it will be difficult to assess the impact of advances in therapy.",

An analysis including country-specific data reported in other languages may reveal regional variations in the contribution of respiratory viruses to the microbiology of CAP. Although, the effect of age was considered as an important source of heterogeneity, a sub-analysis by age could not be performed due to the lack of detailed reporting of study results by age groups; this may have influenced our results. Similarly, subgroup analyses could not be performed according to patient illness severity, patient comorbidities, type of respiratory sample or the presence of specific bacterial co-pathogens due to lack of data. Publication bias applies when studies reporting \u2018positive\u2019 findings are more likely to be published than those reporting \u2018negative\u2019 findings and is an important consideration in meta-analyses evaluating treatment effects. However, in the context of studies examining the proportion of CAP patients in whom viruses were detected, well-conducted \u2018negative\u2019 studies are as \u2018surprising\u2019 as \u2018positive\u2019 studies and both would be expected to be published. The first study to examine the use of standard publication bias tests for proportional meta-analyses (such as this one) found that funnel plots and statistical tests potentially yield misleading results, especially where the proportions within the studies are either very high or very low [62]. These researchers describe an alternative method that can be used to explore the potential for publication bias, where the sample size is used instead of the standard error for each study; however, the reliability and accuracy of this method has yet to be fully explored and independently validated. Therefore, we elected not to analyses publication bias.",
