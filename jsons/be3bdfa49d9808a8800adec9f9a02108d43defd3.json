Analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) has contributed numerous insights to the understanding of the regulation of signal pathways. Different approaches have been used to discover PPI and characterize protein complexes. In addition to conventional PPI methods, such as yeast two-hybrid (YTH), af fi nity puri fi cation coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is emerging as an important and popular tool to unravel protein complex and elucidate protein function through the interaction partners. With the AP-MS method, protein complexes are prepared fi rst by af fi nity puri fi cation directly from cell lysates, followed by characterization of their components by mass spectrometry. In contrast to most PPI methods, AP-MS re fl ects PPI under near physiological conditions in the relevant organism and cell type. AP-MS is also able to probe dynamic PPI dependent on protein posttranslational modi fi cations, which is common for signal transduction. AP-MS mapping protein interaction network of various signal pathways has dramatically increased in recent years.

In a simpli fi ed diagram of a signaling pathway, upon interaction of a ligand, the receptor alters its conformation, such as dimerization, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, leading to recruitment of intracellular molecules and subsequent activation of downstream signal cascades.

The functionality of proteins relies on their ability to interact with one another, whereas pathogenic conditions can re fl ect the perturbations of these protein interactions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Numerous protein-protein interaction (PPI) methods have been developed, but only a few of them are used for large-scale PPI detection, including yeast twohybrid (YTH), protein fragment complementation assay (PCA), luciferase-mediated interactome (LUMIER), mammalian protein-protein interaction trap (MAPPIT), protein array, and af fi nity puri fi cation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (AP-MS). The YTH system is the fi rst assay for analysis of large-scale protein-protein interactions and widely accepted method (Fields and Song 1989 ) . In YTH system, interested gene (bait, X) is fused to the DNA-binding (DB) domain of a transcription factor such as Gal4 (DB-X), while the interacting protein (prey, Y) is fused to an activation domain (AD) such as Gal4-AD (AD-Y). Physical interaction between X and Y brings AD and DB together, which reconstitutes the transcription factor and subsequently activates the downstream reporter genes (Fields and Song 1989 ) . Like the YTH, PCA requires that bait and prey are each fused with incomplete fragments of a third protein, which acts as a reporter. Interaction between bait and prey proteins brings the fragments of reporter protein in close enough proximity to allow them to form a functional reporter protein (Rossi et al. 1997 ) . When fl uorescent proteins are reconstituted, the PCA is called bimolecular fl uorescence complementation assay (Kerppola 2009 ) . LUMIER is basically a co-immunoprecipitation assay, in which bait is linked to an epitope for puri fi cation and prey protein is fused to renilla or fi re fl y luciferase for detection (Barrios-Rodiles et al. 2005 ) . In the MAPPIT, bait and prey proteins are linked to signaling de fi cient cytokine receptor chimeras. Interaction of bait and prey restores JAK-STAT cascade after the receptor has been stimulated with ligand, which leads to STAT3-dependent reporter gene activation (Eyckerman et al. 2001 ) . Protein microarray is a microscopic array glass slide on which interested proteins have been af fi xed at separate locations in an ordered manner using a variety of available chemical linkers (MacBeath 2002 ) . Protein microarrays are typically high-density arrays that are used to identify novel proteins or protein-protein interactions.

As with 2 Proteomics De fi nes Protein Interaction Network of Signaling Pathways AP-MS, gene of interests is tagged with desirable epitope for af fi nity puri fi cation. Various tags have been developed, such as FLAG tag, HA tag, glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags, the calmodulin-binding peptide, the streptavidin-binding peptide, or the in vivo biotinylation of the target tagged peptide using coexpression of the BirA ligase (Waugh 2005 ) .

For example, a combination of TAP puri fi cation with standard gel fi ltration has allowed for a better characterization of RNA polymerase II complex (Mueller and Jaehning 2002 ) . Crosslinker is used for detecting weak interactions, such as membrane complex, which may be interrupted by detergents in lysis buffer.

AP-MS can also be combined with quantitative proteomics approaches, such as SILAC and ICAT, to better understand the dynamics of protein complex assembly.

AP-MS couples af fi nity puri fi cation with mass spectrometry and requires more labor works and sophisticated equipments. Basically, baits can be expressed in any cell line, which investigator is interested in. After antibiotic selection, bait expression levels are monitored in stable cell lines by western blot, and cell line expressing low bait protein level (close to endogenous level) is usually chosen for following af fi nity puri fi cation. Since the bait expression is close to the counterpart endogenous protein level, we expect the puri fi ed complex re fl ects the endogenous protein interactions under physiological conditions. AP-MS also can be used to detect dynamic protein interactions dependent on protein posttranslational modi fi cation by signal stimulation. Unlike YTH detecting one-to-one interaction (aka binary interaction), AP-MS analyzes the entire bait complex and provides all prey information in one run. However, the puri fi ed complex represents a mix of direct and indirect binding partners since the nature of the interactions identi fi ed in AP-MS data cannot be determined to be either direct or indirect. Last, protein abundance and speci fi city in different cell lines also limits the detection of protein complex. For example, MIB1 and MIB2 have comparable af fi nity with TBK1, but we did not detect MIB2 in TBK1 complex in 293T cells by AP-MS. Using real-time PCR, we found MIB1 predominantly expressed in 293T cell line (Li et al. 2011 ) .

Any af fi nity tag can be used for AP-MS in theory, and most successful tags developed to date are FLAG, HA, S-tag, and tandem af fi nity puri fi cation (TAP) tag. Each puri fi cation tag has advantages and disadvantages, and the appropriate technique should be selected depending on the goals of the experiment. For example, a single FLAG or HA epitope only adds 8-11 amino acids (Li et al. 2011 ) , while the TAP tag adds a >20-kDa tag (Krogan et al. 2006 ) which may cause more nonspeci fi c binding.

Originally developed for yeast, the fi rst TAP tag consists of calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP), followed by tobacco etch virus protease (TEV protease) cleavage site and protein A with high af fi nity to immunoglobulin gamma (IgG). Protein complex is fi rst puri fi ed from the cell lysate on an IgG af fi nity resin and cleaved from the protein A tag with TEV protease. The eluate is then enriched in a second af fi nity puri fi cation step on an immobilized calmodulin column. Several variants of TAP with different combinations of tags, such as FLAG-HA double tags, are developed. Usually, one-step puri fi cations on average preserve weaker or more transient protein-protein interactions in the price of a higher number of nonspeci fi c binding proteins. Conversely, the tandem procedure tends to yield cleaner results, but weak interactions can be lost. FLAG and HA double tags are most commonly applied for tandem puri fi cation of protein complexes. We compared the effect of tandem tag versus single tag puri fi cation on the yield of total prey and HCIP by examining four protein complexes puri fi ed by single puri fi cation with FLAG versus a two-step puri fi cation with FLAG followed by HA (Li and Dorf 2013 ) . MS analysis revealed that the number of total interactors was dramatically reduced in all protein complexes (TBK1, NAP1, IRF3, and SINTBAD) isolated by TAP puri fi cation. However, the ratio of HCIP to total prey did not increase. Consistently, more HCIP were detected by single-step af fi nity puri fi cation ( Fig. 2. 2 ). In brief, tandem puri fi cation reduces the NSBP at the price of HCIP loss.

Gel pieces were then subjected to an in-gel trypsin digestion procedure to produce peptides for mass spectrometry analysis. But the extraction ef fi ciency of peptides from a gel is low and dependent on the primary structure of the peptide. As an alternative approach to in-gel digestion, protein mixtures can be digested in solution without prior separation (Behrends et al. 2010 ) . Because buffer components, such as detergents, interfere with the mass spectrometry ionization process, protein samples need to be precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA), washed, and redissolved in a digestion buffer. The main advantages of solution digestion are the reduction of the time and a higher recovery of peptides compared to in-gel digestion. However, bear in mind that some proteins like membrane proteins are resistant to be redissolved. The peptide mixture can be directly introduced into the mass spectrometer or separated by HPLC before mass spectrometric analysis (LC-MS). The two primary mass spectrometry methods developed for identi fi cation of proteins are electrospray ionization (ESI) (Fenn et al. 1989 ) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) (Hillenkamp et al. 1991 ) . Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is a desorption ionization method. A sample solution is sprayed from a small tube into a strong electric fi eld in the presence of a fl ow of warm nitrogen to assist desolvation. The droplets formed evaporate in a region maintained at a vacuum of several torr causing the charge to increase on the droplets. The multiply charged ions then enter the analyzer. The most obvious feature of an ESI spectrum is that the ions carry multiple charges, which reduces their mass-to-charge ratio compared to a singly charged species. This advantage allows mass spectra to be obtained for large molecules. A major disadvantage is that this technique cannot analyze mixtures very well. The other most used technique, MALDI, is a two-step process. First, desorption is triggered by a UV laser beam. Matrix material heavily absorbs UV laser light, leading to the ablation of upper layer (~micron) of the matrix material. A hot plume produced during the ablation contains many species: neutral and ionized matrix molecules, protonated and deprotonated matrix molecules, matrix clusters, and nanodroplets. The second step is ionization (more accurately protonation or deprotonation). In the most common instrumental designs, ESI and MALDI are performed with mass spectrometers capable of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/ MS) experiments. Ion traps, quadrupole time-of-fl ight instruments (Q-TOF), Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers (FTMS), and the Orbitrap are the most common types of instrumentation now used in high-end protein analysis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 469, "end": 492, "text": "(Behrends et al. 2010 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1227, "text": "(Fenn et al. 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1286, "end": 1311, "text": "(Hillenkamp et al. 1991 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mass Spectrometric Protein Identi fi cation"}, {"text": "Most protein interactomes only represent as static entities, which however only poorly captures the dynamics of complex composition.

Systematic methods to map dynamic changes include semi-quanti fi cation based on total spectral counts or ion intensities of precursor peptide (MS1) or fragment ions (MS2) and use of isotopic labeling approaches to obtain more accurate relative quanti fi cation. Relative quanti fi cation methods such as the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) detect differences in protein abundance among samples using nonradioactive isotopic labeling. Although relative quantitation is more costly and time-consuming, and less sensitive to experimental bias than label-free quantitation, it entails labeling the samples with stable isotope labels that allow the mass spectrometer to distinguish between identical proteins in separate samples. Differentially labeled samples are combined and analyzed together, and the differences in the peak intensities of the isotope pairs accurately re fl ect difference in the abundance of the corresponding proteins. Thus, relative quantitation may discover the dynamic interactions by comparing the change of identical protein abundances from same bait cells with and without extracellular stimulation. Absolute quantitation of proteins is also developed by using isotopic peptides entails spiking known concentrations of synthetic, heavy isotopologues of target peptides into an experimental sample (Mirgorodskaya et al. 2012 ) . However, the cost of absolute quantitation is too high and not realistic for large-scale interactome mapping.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1592, "end": 1618, "text": "(Mirgorodskaya et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Quanti fi cation and Dynamics"}, {"text": "As quantitative methods become more robust, there will be increasing demand for detection of dynamic protein interaction upon extracellular stimulation.

The most common ones are from researchers' hands when they perform puri fi cation and handle samples. These contaminants usually are keratin proteins and easy to remove from the dataset. There are also other various kinds of nonspeci fi c binding proteins: (1) proteins binding to af fi nity matrices, like STK38 and PRMT5; (2) proteins bind to af fi nity tag, like KIF11 binding to FLAG tag; (3) abundant proteins (e.g., actin, tubulin); (4) proteins prefer binding to speci fi c domain, like ribosomal proteins binding to baits with nucleic acid-binding domain; (5) and heat-shock proteins for protein folding. Therefore, it is important to use cell line stably expressing baits at near physiological levels to avoid NSBPs, as transient overexpression may probably result in protein aggregation and improper intracellular localization. To discriminate NSBP from the protein complex, repetition of AP-MS is mandatory. In our experiences, NSBPs are dramatically different in two independent AP-MS of the same bait. Proper controls including cells expressing GFP with the same epitope will be also useful to exclude NSBPs.
