OM is a multifactorial disease with multiple risk factors, including preceding or concurrent viral URT infection. Hence, OM is also a polymicrobial disease. The mechanisms by which viruses predispose to bacterial OM are replete; however, all are predicated on the general principle of compromise of primary host airway defenses. Thus, despite an as-yet incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial superinfection of a virus-compromised respiratory tract, the URT viruses are known to induce histopathology of airway mucosal epithelium, up-regulate expression of eukaryotic receptors used for bacterial adherence, alter the biochemical and rheological properties of airway mucus, and affect innate and acquired host immune functions, among others. Although discussed here in the context of OM, during preceding or concurrent viral infection of the human respiratory tract, viral impairment of airway defenses and the resulting predisposition to subsequent bacterial coinfection are also known to be operational in the mid and lower airway as well.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "OM is a term used broadly to describe AOM as well as OME and refers to an inflammation of the middle ear cavity or tympanum (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/ erv.09.63), regardless of etiology. AOM is defined as the presence of MEF (or effusion) in conjunction with rapid onset of symptoms that can include otalgia, otorrhea, fever, and irritability [1] . OME is defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear in the absence of signs or symptoms of an ear infection [1] . OM can be a purely viral infection; however, in childhood, an \"ear infection\" is more typically considered to be the bacterial component of a viral-bacterial coinfection. OM is highly prevalent worldwide, resulting in extensive morbidity and socioeconomic burden. In 1990, there were 24.5 million physicians' office visits made for OM in the United States, representing a greater than 200% increase compared with that reported in the 1980s [2] . Worldwide, it is reported that between 65 and 330 million children suffer from chronic secretory OM, 60% of which have an associated hearing loss [3] [4] [5] . As such, OM is the most frequently diagnosed illness in children under 15 years of age and is the primary cause for Emergency Room visits [6] . Shockingly, in 1990, \u03f328,000 childhood deaths were attributed to OM worldwide [5] . Although today, OM is only rarely associated with mortality in developed countries, the associated morbidity is nonetheless significant. The most common sequelae of OM [7, 8] is hearing loss with behavioral, educational, and language development delays as additional consequences of early-onset OM [9, 10] .

The relevance of this hypothesis to pathogenesis of OM has been demonstrated as a result of the fact that many URT viruses do indeed augment adherence by specific bacterial pathogens of OM. For example, influenza A virus increases the adherence of S. pneumoniae to mouse tracheal epithelial cells [19] but not of NTHI to chinchilla tracheal epithelium in organ culture [20] . Infection with AV types 1, 2, 3, and 5 significantly enhances the binding of adherent strains of S. pneumoniae, which had been isolated from the NP of children with frequent epi-sodes of AOM, to human lung epithelial cells in vitro [21] . Similarly, RSV infection of A549 cells significantly enhances attachment by NTHI that specifically express one of several known adhesins [22] . By flow cytometry, El Ahmer et al. [23] showed that viral infection significantly increased adherence by all three groups of microorganisms most commonly associated with AOM and chronic OM to influenza A virus-infected Hep-2 cells. Through the use of a panel of mAb directed against specific cell-surface antigens, these latter investigators found that infection of Hep-2 cells with influenza A virus resulted in a significant increase in expression of known receptors for adherence used by several Gram-negative bacteria. More recently, it was shown that URT viruses can induce upregulated expression of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1, ICAM1, and platelet-activating receptor, additional eukaryotic receptors known to be used for adherence by multiple human mucosal pathogens [24 -26] .

The immature Eustachian tube is also more compliant (or \"floppy\"), as engagement of the tensor veli palatini muscle (which holds mature Eustachian tubes closed passively) is not yet complete. These attributes make the pediatric Eustachian tube naturally more susceptible to retrograde ascent by microbes that typically colonize the NP; however, this susceptibility is enhanced significantly during times of URT viral compromise.

Although an inflammatory response is necessary for microbial clearance, an overzealous host response to the presence of microbes (particularly endotoxin-expressing, Gram-negative bacteria) is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis and prolongation of OM via the associated tissue destruction and interference with penetration of antimicrobials into the site, among other mechanisms [67] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 141, "end": 145, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1282, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral effect on host immune functions"}, {"text": "In the case of a multifactorial and polymicrobial disease such as OM, it is probably wisest to consider the relative potential benefit versus deficit of inflammatory changes in the middle ear to the host in terms of when they are occurring within the disease course and to what degree.

This uncertainty has led to an active field of investigation, wherein several laboratories are beginning to look at multiple aspects of the kinetics and dynamics of this inflammatory process in greater detail. A full discussion is beyond the scope of this review; however, a few examples include studies, wherein it has been observed that NTHI, the most common pathogen of OME, as well as of chronic and recurrent OM [101] , can induce necrosis of PMNs, one of the first cellular defenders of the middle ear [102] .

Moreover, Miles and colleagues [104] have shown that dying and necrotic neutrophils are actually anti-inflammatory, subsequent to release of \u2423-defensins. Conversely, Ed Swords and his colleagues [105, 106] have shown that when one of the bacterial pathogens of OM induces and then resides within a biofilm community in the middle ear or lung, it modifies itself so that the endotoxin expressed on the bacterial surface is less likely to induce inflammation, thereby reducing the likelihood that it will be cleared and ensuring longer term residence within its human host.

To demonstrate the net collateral effect that RSV-induced, altered expression of this defensin had on the bacterial load present in the URT, we used a polymicrobial infection model to demonstrate that RSV challenge prior to inoculation with NTHI resulted in a consistent increase in the concentration of NTHI, recoverable in nasopharyngeal lavage fluids, compared with a mock-challenged cohort. In addition, we demonstrated that this increased load of NTHI within the chinchilla URT was maintained for at least 5 days, a time-frame in which we also showed that the amount of cBD-1 mRNA and protein within URT mucosa was reduced. In further support of our hypothesis that virus-mediated, altered expression of APs contributes to dysregulation of the load of NTHI residing within the NP, we also showed that delivery of anti-(r)cBD-1 to the chinchilla nasal cavity effectively increased the relative load of NTHI recovered from NL fluids by tenfold, compared with animals that received preimmune serum.
