            "text": "Expiratory human activities generate droplets, which can also carry viruses (e.g. influenza, tuberculosis, measles and SARS-CoV (Sze To and Chao, 2010, Watanabe et al., 2010)), through the atomization processes occurring in the respiratory tract when sufficiently high speeds are reached (Chao et al., 2009, Morawska, 2006). Indeed, during breathing, coughing, sneezing or laughing, toques of liquid originating from different areas of the upper respiratory tract are drawn out from the surface, pulled thin, and broken into columns of droplets of different sizes (Hickey and Mansour, 2019). The content of infectious agents expelled by an infected person depends, among other factors, on the location within the respiratory tract from which the droplets originated. In particular, air velocities high enough for atomization are produced when the exhaled air is forced out through some parts of the respiratory tract which have been greatly narrowed. The front of the mouth is the site of narrowing and the most important site for atomization; since most droplets originate at the front of the mouth and to a lesser extent from the larynx (Johnson et al., 2011), the concentration of an infectious agent in the mouth (sputum) is representative of the concentration in the droplets emitted during the expiratory activities (Morawska, 2006). Thus, knowledge of the size and origin of droplets is important to understand transport of the virus via the aerosol route. Contrary to the findings of early investigations (Duguid, 1945, Jennison, 1942, Wells, 1934), subsequent studies involving optical particle detection techniques capable of measurements down to fractions of a micrometer suggested that the majority of these particles are in the sub-micrometer size range (Papineni and Rosenthal, 1997). More recently, the growing availability of higher temporal and spatial visualization methods using high-speed cameras (Tang et al., 2011), particle image velocimetry (Chao et al., 2009) and, above all, increasingly accurate particle counters (Morawska et al., 2009) allowed the detailed characterization and quantitation of droplets expelled during various forms of human respiratory exhalation flows (e.g. breathing, whispered counting, voiced counting, unmodulated vocalization, coughing). Therefore, in recent years a marked development has occurred both in the techniques for detecting the viral load in the mouth and in the engineering area of the numerical simulation of airborne transmission of the viral load emitted.",

In particular, airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by an asymptomatic subject within pharmacies, supermarkets, restaurants, banks, and post offices were simulated, and the reduction in the average number of infected people from one contagious person, R0, was estimated.",

Therefore, if the concentration of the virus in the sputum and the quantity of droplets emitted with dimensions less than 10 \u00b5m is known, the viral load emitted can be determined through a mass balance. In particular, the viral load emitted is expressed in terms of quanta emission rate (ERq, quanta h-1) (a quantum is defined as the dose of airborne droplet nuclei required to cause infection in 63% of susceptible persons) and is evaluated as:(1)ERq=cv\u2219ci\u2219Vbr\u2219Nbr\u2219\u222b10\u03bcm0NdD\u2219dVdD\n",

The volume of the droplet (V\nd) is determined on the basis of data obtained experimentally by (Morawska et al., 2009): they measured the size distribution of droplets for different expiratory activities (e.g. breathing, whispered counting, voiced counting, unmodulated vocalization), recognizing that such droplets present one or more modes occurring at different concentrations. Therefore, the total volume of droplets was calculated by multiplying droplet number distribution by the volume of a sphere corresponding to each diameter of the size distribution. In particular, in the study a particle size distribution with four channels was considered with midpoint diameters of D\n1=0.8, D\n2=1.8, D\n3=3.5, and D\n4=5.5 \u03bcm. As an example, unmodulated vocalization was recognized as producing additional particles in modes near 3.5 and 5.5 \u03bcm. Details of the aerosol concentrations at the four channels of the size distribution during each expiratory activity are reported in Table 1\n. The midpoint diameters of each channel were used to calculate the corresponding volume of the droplets. The authors point out that the breathing expiratory activity tested by (Morawska et al., 2009), and here considered, is a naturally paced breathing with inspiration by nose and expiration by mouth.",

The model considered here to quantify the airborne transmitted infection risk was carried out by Gammaitoni and Nucci (Gammaitoni and Nucci, 1997) which represents an upgrade of an earlier model provided by Wells-Riley (Riley et al., 1978). This model was successfully adopted in previous papers estimating the infection risk due to other diseases (e.g. influenza, SARS, tuberculosis, rhinovirus) in different indoor microenvironments such as airplanes (Wagner et al., 2009), cars (Knibbs et al., 2011), and hospitals. The Gammaitoni and Nucci model is based on the rate of change in quanta levels through time; in particular, the differential equations for the change of quanta in a control volume as well as the initial conditions (here not reported for the sake of brevity) allowed to evaluate the quanta concentration in an indoor environment at the time t, n(t), as:(3)n(t)=ERq\u2219IIVRR\u2219V+n0+ERq\u2219IIVRR\u2219e-IVRR\u2219tV(quantam-3)\n",

The infectious virus removal rate (IVRR) is the sum of three contributions (Yang and Marr, 2011): the air exchange rate (AER) via ventilation, the particle deposition on surfaces (k, e.g. via gravitational settling), and the viral inactivation (\u03bb). For the demonstration application here described, the AER values were selected according to the ventilation approach as summarized in Table 2, whereas constant values for deposition rate (k) and viral inactivation (\u03bb) were chosen. In particular, the deposition rate was evaluated as ratio between the settling velocity of super-micrometric particles (roughly 1.0\u00d710-4 m s-1 as measured by (Chatoutsidou and Lazaridis, 2019)) and the height of the emission source (1.5 m), thus k resulted equal to 0.24 h-1. The viral inactivation was evaluated on the basis of the SARS-CoV-2 half-life (1.1 h) detected by (van Doremalen et al., 2020), thus \u03bb resulted equal to 0.63 h-1.",

The latter represents a key assumption for the application of the model as it considers that the air is well-mixed within the modelled space. The authors highlight that in epidemic modeling, where the target is the spread of the disease in the community, it is impossible to specify the geometries, the ventilation, and the locations of the infectious sources in each microenvironment. Therefore, adopting the well-mixed assumption is generally more reasonable than hypothesizing about specific environments and scenarios because the results must be interpreted on a statistical basis (Sze To and Chao, 2010).",

The trends clearly highlight that the presence of the infected individual remaining inside for 10 minutes leads to an increase in the quanta concentration in the volume: in particular, a higher peak of quanta concentration was recognized, as expected, for reduced ventilation (NV) with respect to the mechanical ventilation (MV). People entering the pharmacy after the infected individual are exposed to a certain quanta concentration during their 10-min time, and the resulting risk for their exposure (evaluated through equation (4)) is just a function of the quanta concentration trend. For example, people entering the microenvironment around the quanta concentration peak are at a higher risk than people entering the pharmacy later. Figure 2 shows an example of a customer entering at min 26 and leaving at min 36: the risk for this 10-min exposure is 2.8% in natural ventilation conditions and 1.2% in mechanical ventilation conditions. During the entire exposure time of such a scenario (3 hours and 10 minutes), 179 customers (after the infected individual) enter the pharmacy and each of them receive their own risk. In particular, the average risk of the 179 customers is 1.3% for NV conditions and 0.4% for MV conditions, then leading to a R0 (among the customers) of 2.34 and 0.80, to which must be added the R0 of the five pharmacists exposed for the entire period.

The exposed subjects were considered under light exercise and/or standing activity level, thus the average IR amongst these two activity levels was considered as mentioned in the methodology section (IR=0.96 m3 h-1). The graph clearly highlights some critical exposure scenarios and microenvironments. Indeed, in all the microenvironments, a R0>1 was estimated for all the exposure scenarios before lockdown (B) when the ventilation relied only upon the building being airtight (i.e. natural ventilation conditions): R0 was equal to 3.70, 2.19, 47.3, 3.64, and 3.52 for pharmacy, supermarket, restaurant, post office, and bank, respectively. The large value for the restaurant is obviously due to the simultaneous co-presence of many people (80 customers and 4 waiters) and to the long exposure time (1 h and 30 min in the current simulations). This situation is obviously improved if mechanical ventilation systems are adopted, but the R0 is still higher than 1 (R0=5.35). Similar results are obviously expected for all the indoor environments characterized by high crowding indexes and long-lasting exposures such as schools, swimming pools, gyms \u2013 venues that, in fact, were also concomitantly locked down by the government. Actually, adopting mechanical ventilation solutions that purportedly provide an adequate indoor air quality (i.e. providing AER values suggested by the standards (UNI, 1995)) did not satisfactorily reduce the R0 in the other microenvironments investigated. Indeed, the R0 values obtained from the simulations performed for the pharmacy, supermarket, post office, and bank equipped with mechanical ventilation systems in the conditions before lockdown, with mechanical ventilation in operation, were still slightly >1 (1.16-1.30).",

The exposure scenarios after lockdown were further improved for indoor environments equipped with mechanical ventilation systems, as the R0 were much lower than 1 (0.22, 0.12, 0.17, and 0.34 for pharmacy, supermarket, post office, and bank, respectively). Therefore, if in a single day the infected individual visited different environments, the resulting R0 would be lower than 1 only if all the microenvironments were equipped with mechanical ventilation systems. Once again, these results highlight the importance of proper ventilation of indoor environments and are in line with the scientific literature that recognizes the importance of ventilation strategies in reducing indoor-generated pollution (Stabile et al., 2017)(Stabile et al., 2019).",

This information could provide key information for engineers and indoor air quality experts to simulate airborne dispersion of diseases in indoor environments. To this end, an approach to estimate the quanta emission rate (expressed in quanta h-1) is proposed on the basis of the emitted viral load from the mouth (expressed in RNA copies in mL-1), typically available from virologic analyses. Such approach also takes into account the effect of different parameters (including inhalation rate, type of respiratory activity, and activity level) on the quanta emission rate. High emission values have been found for an SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic subject both in the light exercise condition during speaking and in the heavy exercise with oral breathing.",
