Although majority of pilgrims who were concerned with contacting MERS-CoV at Hajj planned to use preventive measures, in practice few applied the measures and no significant difference was observed between those who were concerned and those who were not. This may indicate that among Hajj pilgrims, there may be unique factors and barriers that affect their compliance with preventive measures against the infectious diseases which needs further investigation.

Additionally, the pilgrims\u2019 participation in the pre-travel survey may have increased their awareness of the recommended preventive health measures, leading to higher reported usage (known as \u2018the Hawthorne effect\u2019). Although this is certainly a theoretical consideration, research into the Hawthorne effect on practice-based research suggests that its impact is minimal.16 Moreover, the exact site and time of camel exposure were not explored, and data collection relied on self-report.",
