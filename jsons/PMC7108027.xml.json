For the analysis of RSV-positive and RSV-negative illnesses, a multivariable logistic regression model was created with RSV result (positive\u2013negative) as the dependent variable. For the comparison of RSV and influenza, the dependent variable was RSV positive vs influenza positive. Covariates in the regression models included age group (50\u201364, 64\u201379, or \u226580 years), sex, presence of specific acute respiratory illness symptoms (cough, wheezing, and/or nasal congestion), presence of chronic lung disease, and the interval (days) between symptom onset and date of swab. Grouping of age categories was based on clinical relevance as well as sample size in each group. Smoking status was not available for most seasons and was not included in the analysis. Hospital admissions within 30 days after illness onset were compared for patients with RSV infection and influenza, but the number of hospital admissions was insufficient for multivariable analysis; analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the age distributions among hospitalized patients. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).",

These conditions were not associated with RSV in our community cohort of adults aged \u226550 years with mostly outpatient illness. This is not surprising, as the prevalence of chronic pulmonary and cardiac disease is expected to be lower in the community compared to hospitalized patients or residents of chronic care facilities. The proportion of RSV-positive individuals with congestive heart failure in this analysis was similar to estimates from other studies of medically attended RSV infection in healthy, community-dwelling adults [2]. It is possible that chronic pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure do not increase the risk of RSV infection overall, or RSV infection leading to outpatient care, but the severity of RSV illness is likely to be higher among high-risk groups.",

However, the unadjusted analysis indicated that influenza was associated with an increased odds of hospital admission compared to RSV. Increased age is unlikely to explain this association, as individuals with influenza were significantly younger than those with RSV. These findings suggest that influenza infection may cause more frequent or serious complications compared to RSV in this age group, a finding which has been reported elsewhere [22]. The longer interval from illness onset to healthcare encounter in patients with RSV vs influenza is also consistent with milder illness.",

Participants originally consented to participate in a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness, and recruitment was restricted to periods of influenza circulation except during the 2009\u20132010 pandemic when study recruitment was extended beyond the normal influenza season. Patients with RSV infection before or after our enrollment period were not included, although we would not expect any bias in terms of clinical characteristics or outcomes. An additional limitation is the small number of hospital admissions among patients with RSV, which limited our ability to identify risk factors for hospitalization. Additionally, this study was restricted to medically attended respiratory illnesses, and it does not represent the entire spectrum of RSV infections in the community, including those occurring in people who did not seek medical care.",
