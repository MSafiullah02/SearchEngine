The morbidity from acute respiratory infections is roughly the same in developing as in developed countries, but the associated mortality is many times higher in developing countries [Leowski, 1986]. Influenza\u2010like illness accounts for about 62% of acute respiratory infections [Heijnen et al., 1999]. Viral pathogens are the most significant contributors [Laguna\u2010Torres et al., 2011]. Most of the data on the epidemiology of the etiologic agents of influenza\u2010like illness come from more developed regions of the world, including the United States and Europe. In the case of influenza\u2010like illness, influenza viruses are detected commonly [Puzelli et al., 2006], followed by parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and adenoviruses [Heijnen et al., 1999; Gwaltney, 2002]. However, much less is known concerning the etiology of influenza\u2010like illness besides influenza viruses in China. The objective of this study was to identify the viruses associated with influenza\u2010like illness in Nanjing, China.",

[2011] carried out a study over 5 weeks between January 25, 2010 and February 27, 2010 in France and found 58% samples of influenza\u2010like illness patients positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Hasman et al. [2009] conducted a study during two successive winters, 1998\u20131999 and 1999\u20132000 in the USA, founding 68% of the samples positive for at least one virus. These two studies only collected respiratory specimens during winter. In contrast, the present study was conducted continuously from November 2010 through October 2011, including not only epidemic but also non\u2010epidemic seasons of influenza\u2010like illness. In this study, 50.6% (95% CI, 46.1\u201355.2%) of influenza\u2010like illness patients were found positive for at least one respiratory virus. And the proportion was much higher in January (67.4%) than in June\u2013August (32.6%), which was consistent with the findings of Brittain\u2010Long et al. [2012], indicating that respiratory viruses were more likely associated with influenza\u2010like illness peak in winter rather than peak in summer. Influenza\u2010like illness peak in summer may be due to other respiratory pathogens including bacteria, chlamydia, or mycoplasma. During non\u2010epidemic seasons of influenza\u2010like illness, the detected rates of respiratory viruses were not significantly lower than in influenza\u2010like illness winter peak. However, the identification rates of influenza A and hCoV HKU1 were significantly lower than in the winter peak. It is reasonable to infer that influenza A and hCoV HKU1 may account for the influenza\u2010like illness winter peak. In addition to the sampling periods, detection method, and case definition could also lead to the differences of identification rates among studies. Laguna\u2010Torres et al. [2011] employed virus isolation instead of PCR to identify pathogens and Rezza et al. [2006] included milder febrile cases into analyses. The positive rates of their findings, 24.7% and 43.9%, were both much lower than other studies.",

In France, the respiratory viruses detected most frequently were hMPV and RSV [Falchi et al., 2011]. In the USA, influenza A infections were found most commonly, followed by RSV and PIV\u2010IV [Hasman et al., 2009]. In Central American countries, the viruses found most commonly were influenza A, RSV, AdV, and PIV [Laguna\u2010Torres et al., 2011]. In Italia and Belgium, the sequences were influenza, AdV, PIV [Rezza et al., 2006] and influenza, RV, RSV [Hombrouck et al., 2012], respectively. In this study, the viruses detected most frequently were influenza, RV and hCoV HKU1 overall. Influenza A was found most commonly during the influenza\u2010like illness winter peak and rhinovirus was found most commonly during influenza\u2010like illness summer peak. Sampling seasons, ages of patients and virus types for test may contribute to the differences [Alonso et al., 2012]. Such as, hCoV HKU1 was only tested in the present study. It was not recognized as the principal respiratory virus of influenza\u2010like illness in other studies. Interestingly, RSV was seldom detected in this study. RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract disease and the leading cause of hospital admission among young children worldwide [Ou et al., 2009; Ranmuthugala et al., 2011; Stockman et al., 2012]. When more children under the age of 5 and more patients required hospitalization were included into analyses, the identification rates of RSV increased significantly [Hasman et al., 2009; Falchi et al., 2011; Laguna\u2010Torres et al., 2011]. In the present study on outpatients with influenza\u2010like illness, RSV was common in age groups of 0\u20135 and 6\u201315 but was not detected in other age groups, which may be attributed to the developing immune state and vulnerability to infections [Raboni et al., 2011].",
