P value of independent samples t test/chi\u2010square test and unadjusted odds ratio (OR) were reported to test whether specific characteristics were associated with MERS\u2010CoV infection in dialysis patients (Table 1). The area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the accuracy of each predictor in identifying MERS\u2010CoV infection (Table 2). We developed the MERS risk\u2010prediction model in dialysis patients using the stepwise logistic regression model. Fifteen potential predictors of MERS\u2010CoV were evaluated at \u03b1 \u2264 0.05. The goodness\u2010of\u2010fit of the final model was evaluated using the Hosmer\u2010Lemeshow test. A P value of greater than 5% (\u03b1 > 0.05) indicates the model fit the data well. The discrimination of the model was evaluated by the receiver operator characteristic curve and was compared with the each of the most important predictors (Figure 1). The risk model was internally validated in 100 bootstrap samples drawn with replacement from the study sample (N = 104). The model was presented in the form of the predictive probability of MERS\u2010CoV infection in dialysis, which is a function of the important selected variables, refer to the supplement file. The Youden index was used to identify optimal probability cut\u2010off value for the MERS risk stratification.",

MERS\u2010CoV infection is common in dialysis patients,1, 5, 6 and is associated with increased rapid spread,1 which can be prevented through early detection, isolation, and monitoring individuals at risk. Subsequently, a predictive model was developed for MERS\u2010CoV infection in hemodialysis facilities. The model shows promising accuracy in detecting high\u2010risk dialysis patients with an AUC of 76.99%.",

Earlier studies reported that chest pain was one of the most common symptoms in the MERS\u2010CoV population.17, 18 In agreement with a matched case\u2010control study,19 we found no differences between MERS and non\u2010MERS groups in regards to fever, shortness of breath, cough, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.",

According to our risk\u2010prediction model, ALT has poor predictive utility.
