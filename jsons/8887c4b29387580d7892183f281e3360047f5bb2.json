Specifically, 1) we evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus. 2) Determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease. 3) Simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the covid-19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected. Besides, implementation of efficient public health policies could help flattens the epidemic curve.",

If they get infected by the virus, they become immediately Infectious) and they remain infectious until they Recover assuming immunity during the rest of the outbreak. In our paper, the last group was modified to \"Removed\" (Giraldo and Palacio, 2008) . Thus, the individual is Infectious until he is Removed either by being placed in quarantine, being hospitalized or by recovering (and not susceptible anymore 5 ) or dying from the virus. We also assume that the population in our study is closed and that individuals mix uniformly in the community. Following Britton and Giardina (2016) we also assume that all individuals are equally susceptible to the disease and equally infectious if they get infected.",

In this case, the peak of the infection will occur between day number 78 and day number 85 starting from March 6, which is between 25th and 29th May.
