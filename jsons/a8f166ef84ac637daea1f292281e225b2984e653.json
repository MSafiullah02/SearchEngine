            "text": "During these unprecedented times, the global drug supply could severely get impacted 24 by this pandemic, and the results of this shortage could be catastrophic and may last for 25 an extended period, primarily due to the global economic disruption at unprecedented 26 speed and scale. This article examines the potential impact of this problem on patient 27 outcomes and the role of pharmacists and pharmacy policymakers in mitigating this 28 problem. It is still unknown when the global trading channels will reopen. This may jeopardize the 48 decision-making process regarding any anticipated drug shortage. During these times, 49 the drug shortage could lead to serious consequences when it comes to patient 50 outcomes. Certain patients might get transferred to other medical centers in order to 51 access the required drugs affected by the local shortages. 6 The risk of medication errors 52 may be heightened, including that of drug omission, dispensing, or administration. For 53 instance, replacing an institutional formulary medication that is experiencing shortage 54 with another nonformulary medication involves creating a new computerized physician 55 order entry build, familiarizing physicians with the new order entry, as well as 56 pharmacists and nurses with preparation and administration. All of these additional 57 steps carry a higher risk of error particularly in a pandemic situation where it is common 58 to see healthcare providers deployed from their routine practice area or even patient 59 population to serve in a new setting. It may also increase the frequency of patient 60 monitoring, which increases the projected healthcare costs. 6 The conduction of clinical 61 trials will also be affected by drug shortages thus delaying the delivery of essential, 62 lifesaving, and breakthrough drugs. 7 63 Moreover, the prescribed alternative drug may be less effective or may place the patient 64 at a higher risk of developing unwarranted adverse effects. 8, 9 A drug shortage could 65 also result in an increased risk of a drug overdose as a result of changing drug 66 concentrations and strengths. 8, 9 Certain healthcare institutions may rely on their 67 inpatient pharmacy to compound certain drugs that are in shortage. Compounding high- result of the pandemic will increase the dependence of these healthcare providers on 140 the clinical pharmacists who will find themselves being relied on, even more than ever, 141 as the medication experts on the team. While clinical pharmacists may practice in a 142 specific setting or serve a specific population are generally familiar with the institutional 143 medication policies, formulary, computerized order entry, drug information resources 144 and guidelines. This will allow them to significantly support other providers in their newly 145 assigned tasks and help relieve overall provider anxiety and secure patient safety. 146",

First and foremost, pharmacists aim to secure the most evidence-based 95 medications for COVID-19 patients to improve outcomes. For example, recently, this 96 has involved the compassionate use basis for drugs such as remdesivir. This 97 medication has resulted in a numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in 98 patients with severe symptoms. 17 Pharmacists are involved in corresponding with health 99 authorities, granting institutional review board approvals, and submitting the necessary 100 related paperwork. However, the role of the pharmacists does not stop here. It extends 101 to preparing the required computerized order entry build, communicating with supply 102 chain, and up till the process of actually preparing the medication for administration. 103 This is in addition to the role of the clinical pharmacist in collaborating with physicians to 104 select candidates for the medication and optimizing overall medical therapy. 105 Another contemporary issue that pharmacists are an integral part of is that of emerging 106 drug shortages of recently repurposed medications such as hydroxychloroquine, 107 azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir but also of some over the counter cough and cold 108 medications. The media and high-level political attention given to such therapies have 109 resulted in a dramatic increase in demand. The pharmacist is entrusted with advocating 110 for appropriate prescribing and also continuing to secure such medications for patients 111 who depend on them for their main indications. The pharmacist is not only involved in 112 provider and patient education but also helping in setting institutional and community 113 pharmacy policies on appropriate prescribing and dispensing of these medications. As begins with drug demand analysis to identify drugs of interest, formulate special 116 approval procedures and design best practice alerts to avoid inappropriate prescribing 117 and drug hoarding. 18 118 Intensive care medications have been particularly affected given the significant surge in 119 use and demand for narcotics, sedatives and neuromuscular blockers. Pharmacists are 120 expected to be involved in strategies to deal with these shortages which involve 121 evaluating and switching to alternative generic medications and switching between 122 therapeutic options. Examples here include the switching from neuromuscular blocking 123 agent cisatracurium, on shortage due to increased demand, to rocuronium. Another 124 example is switching between the intravenous analgesic fentanyl to remifentanil. Such 125 changes while they may seem simple involve a crucial role for the pharmacist in 126 educating other members of the healthcare team on the appropriate use and other 127 associated ordering and administration information to avoid the medication errors that 128 we previously discussed. Other strategies include using adjuvant medications to spare 129 the use of those in high demand as well as supplementing with oral or transdermal 130 formulations to stretch the supply of the intravenous ones. Examples here include 131 utilizing dexmedetomidine, and the use of oral formulations of lorazepam through 132 feeding tubes for those with a functional gastrointestinal tract to attempt weaning 133 propofol and midazolam. In addition, the use of transdermal fentanyl has the potential to 134 help lower the rate or completely stop the intravenous infusion. Pharmacists are 135 involved in designing specific algorithms to successfully implement these strategies 136 utilizing their knowledge of the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of these 137 agents. 138",

It is important for the pharmacist to be aware of general 151 guidelines to mitigate shortages such as those published by the American Society of 152Health-System Pharmacists.19  This is in addition to the pharmacist being entrusted to 153 provide frontline medical staff with answers to drug information questions and 154 participating in clinical trials. Pharmacists are also encouraged to collaborate at a global 155 level to share experiences on strategies to mitigate drug shortages as well as overall 156 innovations as they relate to academic, institutional, and community pharmacy practice 157 during the pandemic.Table 1, outline the potential role of the pharmacists in drug 158 shortages Policymakers working at the national and institutional levels should act proactively to 163 tackle this issue. National policymakers should work to preserve the drug supply by all 164 means. Several examples have been proposed in the literature in order to preserve the 165 drug supply, including the creation of a list of drugs that could potentially be in shortage 166 due to this pandemic. This entails drugs that have no generic alternative and are solely 167 manufactured in locked-down countries. 20 It is extremely crucial to create a freely 168 available warning system to alert all stakeholders about potential drug shortages. They 169 should ensure that national health care institutions are not working in silos during these 170 times by generating channels for rapid communication between all local healthcare 171 institutions. This will guarantee the availability of certain lifesaving drugs with significant 172 demand. 21,22 173 Moreover, policymakers should require manufacturers to disclose the location of drug 174 production publicly in order to provide drug purchasers with enough time to be prepared 175 for any impactful consequences and locate a local alternative if possible. Policymakers 176 should work to incentivize local manufacturers to optimize their supply to meet the 177 demand without contravening the good manufacturing practices, especially those that 178 have profit margins not high enough to keep manufacturing these drugs during the 179 pandemic. An extensive amount of drugs requires specific devices to prepare and 180 administer them safely. Policymakers should work to grant enough custody of these 181 devices and make sure to distribute them to institutions in need. 20 Also, they should 182 educate the public to be extra vigilant in procuring shortage drugs through online 183 sourcing. Policymakers should work to implement adjustable policies that govern the policies. 23,24 186",
