We congratulate the authors for their development and rigorous account of the endoscopic practices they have successfully used to minimize infection of endoscopy staff while providing essential services in this high-risk environment. We would also like to share a U.S. hospital perspective gained from our experience contending with numerous COVID-19 cases after the Biogen conference in Boston, Massachusetts. A COVID-19 standard operating procedure for endoscopy is included in Figure 1 .",

Creating a step-by-step approach to suspected or COVID-19-positive patients from the time they enter the endoscopy unit to the time they leave and ensuring everyone on the team is on the same page was also addressed. Once the team has created this detailed workflow with clear delineation of who is responsible for each step and whom to call for any necessary equipment that may not be readily available in the endoscopy unit such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), mock drills should be conducted with the teams.",

Our hospital created screening forms integrated into the electronic health record to facilitate standardized screening before procedures. Additionally, our health system reaches out to patients both by automated phone calls and our electronic patient portal advising patients to contact their provider before their visit if they have any symptoms. The importance of social or physical distancing as advocated recently by the World Health Organization throughout a patient's time in the endoscopy unit is stressed in the articles, with a 6-foot minimum between individuals. To help meet this requirement, we only allow 1 family member/chaperone per patient who waits in a centralized waiting area, and this visitor cannot enter the pre-or postprocedure areas. Some suggest all patients should wear a mask while in endoscopy. Soetikno et al 2 stated that suspected and COVID-19-positive patients should be given a mask and separated from other patients by at least 6 feet or alternatively placed in a negative pressure room. We believe the latter should be emphasized with more stringent and immediate isolation precautions being instituted for these patients and procedures performed in airborne infection isolation rooms that comply with Level 3 biosafety requirements. We also agree with the need for a separate toilet as part of the isolation to minimize spread of infection due to bioaerosols from the toilet plume. If these resources are not available in the endoscopy unit, cases should be performed where the proper facilities are available. These cases should also preferably happen at the end of the day with patients recovered in the procedure room or back in their isolation unit. Consideration may be given to performing urgent procedures at the patient's bedside to minimize these high-risk patients being transported throughout the hospital.",

Some also recommend checking the temperature of all staff at the beginning of the work shift. We suggest labeling each computer so the same provider uses that computer and chair for the entire day and separating by at least 6 feet. Because many procedure rooms may be empty, 1 provider per day can use these rooms as \"offices.\" We have converted to obtaining verbal consent by phone or in person (6 feet away) from patients and not having patients physically sign consent forms. Pens, clipboards, phones, and chairs should not be shared. If unsure, these items should be cleaned before use and hand hygiene performed after use. Deep cleaning of the entire endoscopy unit is recommended nightly. Following procedures on suspected or COVID positive patients, staff should shower and change into new scrubs. Before leaving from work, providers should remove scrubs and wear regular clothes outside the hospital. Some even suggest changing out of these clothes into fresh clothes before entering the home.",

This makes all endoscopic procedures high risk from an infectious standpoint, and appropriate PPE is recommended. This is an important point. N95 face masks are recommended for high-risk patients undergoing any endoscopic procedure with a standard surgical mask recommended for low-risk patients. However, we believe there is a spectrum of risk severity that is regional and temporal in nature. In a pandemic where asymptomatic transmission is known to occur, significant under-testing continues, and society is expected to practice extreme physical distancing with closure of nonessential businesses, are there any truly low-risk patients? Remember that COVID-19 is believed to be at least 3 times as contagious as the flu virus, and recent reports out of China estimate that as many as 44% of transmissions could occur involving asymptomatic patients. 5 This begs the question of whether all endoscopy patients should be considered high-risk in areas of active community spread. It makes little sense for healthcare providers to perform aerosolizing procedures, with patients coughing or passing gas on them, while not wearing an N95 mask or better.",

A study from China showed that no medical staff working in high-risk departments who wore N95 masks and practiced strict hand hygiene regardless of patient infection status became infected. 6 Ideally, an N95 mask and face shield should be used with other standard PPE for all endoscopy cases and PAPRs for known COVID-19-positive cases if the case absolutely cannot be deferred. The suggestion to use PAPRs for COVID-19-positive patients comes from China's anecdotal experience during endoscopic endonasal procedures where infection spread was apparently not controlled with N95 masks and only possible after use of PAPRs. The CDC maintains a list of manufacturers and models of all approved N95 or better respirators, including NIOSH-Approved Air Purifying Respirators which have recently been approved for use in health care settings as part of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency. 7 We fully appreciate that PPE is currently in tight supply; however, with careful conservation the above may be possible. It starts with only doing procedures that are absolutely necessary. PPE use should be tightly regulated. Our hospital has gathered all masks and face shields, with every provider signing one out each day as needed. Before this we had a PPE station in the unit where the provider signed out masks using their identification number, employee number, and patient medical record number. The mask can be reused as long as it is functional, not soiled, and not used in a suspected or COVID-19-positive patient. It is important to cover the N95 mask to prevent soiling. We prefer a face shield for this purpose because surgical masks are also running low throughout the country.",

The face shield should be cleaned with disinfectant wipes before storage.

This information flow includes having reliable top-down information from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local departments of public health, medical societies, and departmental and hospital leadership as well as accurate assessment of relevant metrics specific to the endoscopy unit. For the latter, a combination of automated means through software and manual workflows can be used to gather important data. Initial considerations may include number of symptomatic staff, number of available reserve staff, number of active procedure rooms, local epidemiology and anticipated case burden (inpatient and outpatient), stocks of PPE, and the case composition of scheduled patients, among others. Additionally, what is considered pertinent data may change over time as the pandemic evolves. It is vital to keep monitoring these metrics throughout the COVID-19 period so that any signals of potential problems can be detected early and more proactive strategies deployed.
