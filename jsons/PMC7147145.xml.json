The rapid global expansion of this outbreak is the result of an efficient human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1]. The high viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples indicate that virus transmission via respiratory secretions, in the form of droplets (> 5 \u00b5) or aerosols (< 5 \u00b5), may be most likely [2]. Surfaces contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them represent another way of contamination [2]. Viable virus could be detected in aerosols up to 3 h post-aerosolization; its half-life on surfaces seems to depend on the contaminated surfaces. Laboratory tests reveal viable virus up to 4 h on copper, up to 24 h on cardboard and up to 2\u20133 days on plastic and stainless steel [3].",

This also accounts for patients who are referred for an IR procedure. There is a need for decentralization of services and segregation of patients in response to the risk of nosocomial transmission of infection. Execution of IR procedures in situations with suspected airborne infections needs particular precautions to reduce the risk of transmission to the healthcare workers. As far as possible, procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection should be performed at a specially designed isolation facility. In our hospital, every patient and healthcare worker has to undergo RT-PCR testing (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from COVID-19. Uncertain cases are managed as infected ones, and healthcare workers with suspected infection are kept away from the hospital (preventive quarantine). Luckily this has not been required yet, perhaps in part due to attention to these recommendations and guidelines.",

The same scheme has been adopted for interventional radiologists: per week only 5 (2 for neuro and 3 for body) go to the hospital where they cover IR procedures and replace the peripherally inserted central catheter (Picc) team for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (Picc team is now employed in \u201cCOVID-area\u201d).

Based on the available evidence, and as reported above, the COVID-19 virus is transmitted between people through close contact and droplets, exposure to particles in the air, or after touching contaminated objects and surfaces [2]. Consultation with local epidemiology expertise should be undertaken to assess the status of current suite ventilation, and whether positive, negative, filtered, or recirculating air is present. Such knowledge can assist in the development of specific and standardized workflow protocols that match the ventilation requirements to the degree of specific isolation. That being said, COVID isolation in the angiosuites may not require dedicated extra ventilation systems. However, high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration systems in the angiographic suites may represent the best way to protect staff. Dedicated negative pressure rooms with air filtration may be ideal for COVID, especially in procedure rooms, but potentially also in waiting rooms, bathrooms and soiled equipment or decontamination rooms, when feasible.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of appropriate PPE for standard, contact and airborne precautions [4] (Fig. 2A\u2013C). Aerosol-generating procedures usually performed in an angiographic suite may include biopsy, fine needle aspiration, insertion of naso-gastric or naso-jejunal feeding tubes, percutaneous gastrostomy, esophageal, gastric or duodenal dilatation and/or stenting, tracheal dilatation and/or stenting, and bronchial artery embolization (for the risk of heavy bouts of coughing due to hemoptysis) [5]. For thoracentesis or paracentesis sample preparations, transfer should be avoided, or if absolutely necessary, be performed with needle tip below fluid surfaces to minimize aerosolization. When carrying out these procedures on Covid-19 patients, the WHO recommends N95 or FFP2 standard masks or equivalent, and gowns, gloves, eye protection, aprons and shoe covers [4, 6]. N95 masks are equivalent to PPE masks, designed to achieve a very close facial fit and protect the wearer from airborne particles; they are tested to block at least 95% of very small (0.3 \u00b5) test particles. FFP2 masks have a minimum of 94% filtration of particles (0.4 \u00b5) percentage (Fig. 3).",

On balance, we believe it is advisable for staff to stay inside the angiosuite protected by lead shields to avoid cross-contamination of less adequately protected staff outside the suite or in the control room. The doors of the positive pressure interventional suite must be closed during the entire procedure to prevent contamination. To minimize the in and out movement from the potentially contaminated room, the staff must remain close to the angiographic table with PPE and sterile equipment. A radiographer, with full PPE but non-sterile, could help control the angiographic table and any additional equipment. One or two more staff members, a radiographer and/or a nurse, may be stationed outside the angiographic room to help and assist the staff in the room (communication should be done by microphone, if available), without room to room travel.",

The virus remains viable for days on surfaces, and although fomite transmission is plausible, there is no definitive consensus at the moment. Viable virus was detected in a lab setting in the air 3 h post-aerosolization and up to 6 h later on copper, 24 h on cardboard, and 2\u20133 days on stainless steel or plastic such as polypropylene. Aerosol virus half-life was 2.7 h, while the half-life on steel was 13 h and 16 h on plastic. This information may have profound implications for room decontamination between IR procedures, surgery, or even imaging, but it remains unclear how this might specifically translate into decontamination practices or standard operating procedures [3]. In the present document, we can only refer to precautions adopted in IR services in the affected areas.",

Pre-, intra- and post-procedural approaches for IR workflow have been described in the setting of an IR unit highly exposed to COVID-19 (Table 2). In our department until now, no incidents between non-infected and infected patients have been documented, and there has been no evidence of COVID-19 infection of healthcare workers in the IR service to our knowledge. Strict adoption of safe practices may increase the cost of equipment and procedural time and unavoidably create new technical difficulties during procedures.
