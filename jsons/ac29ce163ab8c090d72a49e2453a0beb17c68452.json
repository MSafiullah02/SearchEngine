The new idea is to construct a kissing hairpin motif from an overlay of two simple canonical pseudoknots. The difficulty is that the overlay does not satisfy Bellman's Principle of Optimality, and the kissing hairpin cannot simply be built from optimal pseudoknots. Our strategies have time/space complexities of O(n 4 )/O(n 2 ), O(n 4 )/O(n 3 ), and O(n 5 )/O(n 2 ). All strategies have been implemented in the program pKiss and were evaluated against known structures. Surprisingly, our simplest strategy performs best. As it has the same complexity as the previous algorithm for simple pseudoknots, the overlay idea opens a way to construct a variety of practically useful algorithms for pseudoknots of higher topological complexity within O(n 4 ) time and O(n 2 ) space.",

Especially viral genomes have been investigated for kissing hairpins, but also bacterial and eukaryotic ones. Researchers showed that kissing hairpins have important duties in a wide variety of RNA mediated processes. For example, they contribute extensively in stabilizing the structure and also play a role in viral plasmid DNA replication [5] or RNA synthesis [19] .

See Figure 2 for an illustration. Such a decomposition, in full generality, leads to 12 moving boundaries, and makes us resort to canonization. Rule 2 of our canonization constraints eliminates six moving boundaries -the inner endpoints of three helices, which are now fixed by the helix maximality rule.

Given that we already know how to compute optimal simple pseudoknots for the overlapping subwords aubva zb and btcxb yc , can we find their optimal overlay such that z = wcx and t = va w, thus defining the overall optimal decomposition into aubva wcxb yc ? Can we find its optimal energy as the sum from its two constituents? Simple as it seems, there is a problem. First, if w = \u03b5, the optimal choice of a (with respect to a and b ) may conflict with the optimal choice of c (with respect to b and c ). Moreover, in the overlay, the energy contribution of the middle helix (b \u2212 b ) and the structure for v, w, and x embedded within both pseudoknots are accounted for twice, and must be subtracted from the energy sum of both parts. This violates the monotonicity requirement for dynamic programming known as Bellman's Principle: for the overlay, the energy function is non-monotonic, and as a consequence, an optimal kissing hairpin motif may arise as an overlay of sub-optimal pseudoknots. We will present three, increasingly complex strategies A, B, and C, such that their search spaces are properly included in the form Searchspace A \u2286 Searchspace B \u2286 Searchspace C \u2282 Searchspace KH . This relation will allow us to evaluate whether the expense for a more general strategy pays off in practice, but we will not be able to relate our results to an evaluation of the complete search space Searchspace KH of all (non-canonical) structures.",

The RNA polymerase gene (gene 1) of the human coronavirus 229E is a good example for the usefulness of improved secondary structure prediction tools. Analyzing the genome of the human coronavirus, Herold and Siddell [13] guessed, that a \"slippery site\" together with an H-type pseudoknot acts as a frameshift inducing structure. Extensive mutational analyses showed that a kissing hairpin is required for high frequency frameshifts. Their work implied computer-assisted modeling, but prior prediction tools could not detect kissing hairpin motifs. pKiss finds the proper kissing hairpin.",

These negative cases contain the complex pseudoknot which is beyond the class of kissing hairpins, but the helices actually predicted are correct.

Comparing pKiss to the program by Rivas and Eddy brought little insight, as the program solves a more general problem and, as expected from their asymptotics, is much slower and greedy for space. Comparing pKiss to the most recent version of HotKnots [3] on our data set, we find the following: HotKnots currently provides four different parameter sets. Choosing the best prediction from those four in each case, it agrees with Strategy A in 3 out of our 6 positive test cases. On the larger data set of simple pseudoknots, there is more agreement between the methods. Execution time for a single parameter choice is generally lower than for pKiss by a factor of 3 -6. We have also evaluated pKiss on random data and tested the robustness of predictions under varied energy parameters for kissing hairpin initiation. All evaluation data, as well as the first author's M.Sc. thesis, can be obtained from our website at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/pkiss/.",

Strategy A evaluates a more complex motif than simple pseudoknots -without increasing asymptotic complexity. Unexpectedly, Strategy A performs best among A, B, and C -it is faster, agrees on the true positives, and has fewer false negatives. Closer inspection showed that it is always the left pseudoknot of the overlay which was chosen optimally. One may speculate that this is because the strategy is consistent with the hierarchic folding path during transcription. Boldly dropping the symmetric computation starting from the right pseudoknot reduces work in the innermost loop and may provide a speed-up factor close to 2. The more exciting perspective is the extension of the overlay idea to more complex structures. A motif of four hairpins with two kissing interactions, for example, can be overlaid as a b a c b c and b c b d c d . Using ideas of Strategy A, this can, again, be achieved in O(n 4 ) time and O(n 2 ) space! Additionally, alternative decompostions, say a b a c b c with c d c d (a kissing hairpin overlaid with a simple pseudoknot) may be investigated, without raising the asymptotics. Furthermore, two such double kissing structures can form an overlay, and so on. It appears that one can construct a variety of practically useful, albeit increasingly heuristic, programs for pseudoknotted motifs of increasingly complex topologies within O(n 4 ) time and O(n 2 ) space.",
