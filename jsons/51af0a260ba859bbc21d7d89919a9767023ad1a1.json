Through the emergence of conservation medicine as an important field of study in biodiversity management, we have come to appreciate that disease is often a significant risk factor in conservation programmes involving animal-movement protocols, such as translocation, transportation among zoos or reintroduction. Despite our ability to recognize these risks, however, professionals in the zoo and wildlife medicine community have historically been hard-pressed to find and apply appropriate tools that can effectively analyse these risks and use the resultant information to develop more sound programmes. With the absence of such tools, conservation medicine professionals would often adopt a 'zero-risk tolerance' approach to animal-movement recommendations. Using this approach, any perceptible risk of disease introduction or transmission is seen as excessive in the context of maintaining the health of managed individuals, and is therefore unrealistically strict as it fails to recognize that virtually any management action inherently involves risk.",

This gathering of 12 professionals represented one of the earliest attempts explicitly to address disease risk in integrated conservation programmes, and emphasized the immediate need for data assembly and distribution as a productive collaboration between the zoo and wildlife veterinary communities.

A major recommendation from the conference centred on the need to develop a set of quantitative risk assessment tools to assist in the decision-making process regarding the conservation value of animal movement programmes. To help accomplish this goal, participants also set forth a model for standardizing the collection of relevant information across a range of conservation disciplines. The full range of information collected and presented at the conference was published in a special issue of the Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine in 1993.",

We have found two similar system modelling platforms to be outstanding tools in this regard. Perhaps the more popular of the two is STELLA (current version 9 \u00c1 0; isee Systems, 2006, Lebanon, NH, USA), a software package that provides an environment to interactively visualize how complex systems are structured and how they function, thereby creating a graphical representation of our current beliefs and understanding of the problem being considered. Equally important is the ability to use this tool to communicate the system's structure to a wide audience more effectively through the use of diagrams, charts and associated text boxes that can be tailored to particular learning styles. Because of its relative ease of use and graphical nature, STELLA is an excellent tool for bringing together experts from diverse disciplines around the description of a given system. VENSIM (current version 5 \u00c1 6; Ventana Systems, 2006, Harvard, MA, USA) uses a very similar methodology for creating these visual models and can be obtained at a much lower cost in a scaled-down package for broader use. In addition, both packages can be used more intensively to quantitatively simulate the dynamics of a system to understand better the consequences of a particular activity within the system, such as the introduction of a disease to a na\u00efve population.",

            "text": "An example of the use of this methodology for disease risk assessment is provided in Fig. 1 . STELLA was used to construct a visual model of the dynamic relationship between Mountain gorillas Gorilla beringei beringei, human trackers operating as part of the ecotourism industry in south-west Uganda, and children within the villages who may be infected with measles (adapted from Armstrong & Seal, 2001) . The underlying question driving the assessment was: 'Should the children of trackers be vaccinated for measles as a way to minimize risk of disease to the gorillas?' The system visualization led to detailed discussion about the probability that other children in the village, who were not members of tracker's families, could spread measles virus to the trackers. Preliminary results suggested that simply focusing on the families of trackers would not significantly reduce the risk of measles transmission to the nearby Mountain gorilla population. Major village-or region-wide public-health efforts would be necessary to make vaccination of children protective for gorillas. With a detailed graphical depiction of the system, deeper quantitative analysis of the risks involved with particular activities could proceed. Figure 2 shows another simpler example of this general methodology. Generic flowcharting tools were employed to visualize the pathway involved in importing semen from wild Gerenuk Litocranius walleri in Kenya and to evaluate the risk of introducing rinderpest into the captive Gerenuk population in the United States through artificial insemination (Loskutoff et al., 2003) . This example is used to illustrate the identification of critical control points at various stages along the semen importation pathway. For example, rinderpest could be present in the captured individuals, in the trucks used to transport the individual animals following capture or in the hospital facilities where the semen collection is to take place.",

An excellent example of this type of modelling approach in the field of conservation medicine is a technique known as decision analysis. This is simply a method for constructing another type of visual representation of the situation of interest, this time incorporating the decision maker's understanding regarding uncertainty within that system, so that the best decision can be made (i.e. the optimal outcome can be achieved). The formal result of a decision analysis is the preferred 'decision path', with a profile of the risks associated with each possible outcome.",

Decision trees provide a formal graphical structure in which decisions and chance events are linked from left to right in the order they would occur. (For example, before you decide whether to treat an individual for a disease, you need to determine if the individual tests positive for the disease.) The result is a tree structure with the 'root' on the left and branches for each chance event or decision extending to the right. Probabilities of events occurring and, optionally, payoffs for events and decisions are added to each node in the tree. The graphical nature of the tree provides an explicit visual understanding of the decisions being contemplated, as with the use of STELLA and VENSIM, with the added computational rigor necessary to justify the choice of a specific set of optimal choices. A decision analysis in PRECISION TREE generates a risk profile, which compares the payoffs and risks of different decision options. The cumulative risk profile graph displays a cumulative distribution showing the probability of an outcome less than or equal to a certain value. Where uncertainty exists in our depiction of the decision structure, sensitivity analysis options are available to test the impact of this uncertainty on our optimal decision.",

Specifically, this analysis addresses the following question: 'What is the risk of an individual Tsushima leopard cat becoming infected with FIV in the northern region of Tsushima (Kamijima) through being bitten by an FIV-positive Feral cat?' This question emerged from a graphical visualization of the Leopard cat/Feral cat/Domestic cat system in the context of the high-priority diseases identified during the rough assessment phase (Table 1 ). The pathway from Feral cats to Tsushima leopard cats was seen as an important critical control point and, therefore, deserving of detailed quantitative analysis.

As a result, these models produce estimates of morbidity and mortality without considering the important effects of random demographic, environmental and genetic factors. In other words, they lack the core components that make effective population viability analysis (PVA) models inherently useful: an explicit treatment of the intrinsic and extrinsic stochastic forces that put small populations of wildlife at risk of extinction. By developing a detailed, individual-based simulation modelling package of the epidemiology of wildlife disease [see Barlow (1995) for a discussion of the value of individual-based models], and by studying the impacts of disease on population viability through its linkage with an existing PVA model, our understanding of (1) the process of disease transmission in small wildlife populations subject to unpredictable demography and (2) the interactions that occur among demographic factors, environmental variables, disease pathogens and host genetics to impact endangered population persistence, could be greatly enhanced. This integrated product would provide an outstanding opportunity for productive collaboration between the wildlife ecology and veterinary communities. Moreover, such a package could serve as a unique teaching vehicle for students in these fields of study. Through this process, an effort like this can also promote a more intimate integration of scientific disciplines -an endeavor that has recently been argued as vital to the success of biodiversity conservation and its inherent complexity (Redman, 1999; Nyhus et al., 2002; Westley & Miller, 2003) .",

Specifically, we intend to expand our network of experts, to compile datasets appropriate for the rigorous testing of existing tools, to train the larger conservation community in the use of these tools and to continue to explore the development of new tools to serve better the wildlife disease management community. In this regard, the integration of geographic information system (GIS) tools, the application of rigorous economic models for cost-benefit analysis of management alternatives, and even the use of tools for collecting information on disease from outside the scientific community, such as participatory rural appraisal techniques, show particular promise. As wildlife health managers around the world show interest in mastering these tools and techniques, our goal is to continually improve the means by which the world's threatened biodiversity can survive and flourish.",
