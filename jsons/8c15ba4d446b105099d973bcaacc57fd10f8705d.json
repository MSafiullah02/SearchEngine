MERS-CoV was found to be transmitted from Arabian camels to humans, whereas SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans. SARS-CoV-2 seems to have originated from bats and first reports of cases were from Wuhan, Hubei Province in China, suggesting an animal-to-person spread from a live animal market. The virus then spread outside Hubei and subsequently, to the rest of the world via human transmission. Several countries have now reported community spread.

In the midst of this crisis, the Indian health ministry has proposed to provisionally permit medical undergraduates of senior grades to treat COVID-19 patients [14] . This move could help plug the shortage of healthcare professionals and potentially provide care to a large number of people. Hence, students from various healthcare professions were included in our study.",

A higher percentage of correct responses were from undergraduate medical students and the lowest was from non-clinical/administrative staff. This study shows that there is a strong need to implement periodic educational interventions and training programs on infection control practices for COVID-19 across all healthcare professions. Conducting periodic webinars for educational intervention for all healthcare students and professionals including non-clinical and administrative staff, paramedical and nursing sub-groups could be a useful and safe tool to create more awareness.",
