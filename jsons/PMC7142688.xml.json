For instance, bioreactor provides a clean, cost-effective and environmentally friendly technology (Alonso et al., 1998; Esquivel-Gonzalez et al., 2017). Biofiltration processes are based on the ability of microorganisms to attach to packing media in the form of biofilms (Groenestijn and Kraakman, 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2011). During the processing exhaust gas, these pollutants are absorbed by the biofilm and converted into carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and biomass without generating undesirable by-products (Devinny et al., 1999; Kennes, 2012). Biotechnology can effectively control low-concentration pollutants (Iranpour et al., 2005). Therefore it has been successfully applied to treat a wide range of pollutants such as VOCs and odors (Mudliar et al., 2010; Girard et al., 2011).",

However, it still has some drawbacks, such as the emission of bioaerosols (Wang et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2018). Bioaerosols are very small particles suspended in the air that are living or coming from living organisms (Burge, 1990; Despr\u00e9s et al., 2012). Activated sludge and compost, often used as inoculation sources for biofilters, contain a large number of pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses, etc. This might cause the release of bioaerosols containing pathogenic microbial microorganisms and microbial fragments during the biofiltration process, posing a great potential threat to human health (Ottengraf and Konings, 1991; Robertson et al., 2019; Menetrez et al., 2009; Ghosh et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016). Some studies have shown that bioaerosol emission concentrations from bioreactors are usually higher than those of the background environment (Kummer and Thiel, 2008; Chung, 2007; Esquivel-Gonzalez et al., 2017). Long-term exposure to bioaerosols in these environments may have adverse health effects (Pearson et al., 2015).",

Thicker biofilms make it easier for microorganisms to exchange with air currents and be carried away from the packing materials. Moreover, not only dead microorganisms, but also injured microorganisms, fragments of cells, mycotoxins and endotoxins proteins liberated during the lysis process of cells will also fall off the packing materials during the growth of microorganisms in the biofilm. Finally, bioaerosols will be released from the biofilters in the exhaust gas, carrying considerable amounts of microbes out of the biofiltration process.",

Other researchers presented higher values than 104 CFU m\u22123\nair of bioaerosol emissions in the air (Martens et al., 2001; Esquivel-Gonzalez et al., 2017; Valdez-Castillo et al., 2019). Table 1\nbriefly summarizes relevant literature about bioaerosol emissions from biofilters. As presented from the Table, the concentration range of bioaerosol emissions from biofilters is remarkably wide. Bioaerosol emission concentrations from a bioreactor could range from 103 to 108 CFU m\u22123 (Schlegelmilch et al., 2005; Chung, 2007; Esquivel-Gonzalez et al., 2017). The concentration of fungal spores emitted from a biofilter could reach 103\u2013106 CFU/m3, which would cause people exogenous hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Tolvanen and Hanninen, 2005; Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012a; 2012b). The Republic of Poland recommended that the occupational exposure limit for bacterial and fungal microorganisms is 5000 CFU m\u22123 (G\u00f3rny, 2020). Most reported bioaerosol concentrations of the above studies exceeded the limit by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude, suggesting a great potential threat to human health.",

Not only pathogenic microorganisms, but also pathogenic viruses are present in the waste treatment processes (Otawa et al., 2007; Wu and Liu, 2009). Several studies have shown that these pathogenic entities become bioaerosols that are emitted into the air during waste treatment (Bauer et al., 2002). Some opportunistic pathogenic species including Acinetobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus sp., and Bacillus sp. were isolated from the air emissions of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which would cause respiratory disease, urinary tract infection, skin infection and septicemia, etc (Fracchia et al., 2006; Uhrbrand et al., 2017). Ibanga et al. (2018) also presented that A. Fumigatus was emitted from a biofilter ranged of 1 \u00d7 103 to 4.2 \u00d7 103 CFU m\u22123. It has been reported that more than 90% of pulmonary fungal diseases were caused by A. Fumigatus (Latg\u00e9, 2001). Moreover, some epidemic viruses have been detected in feces (Ding et al., 2004), including the 2019-nCoV reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s news. Since the activated sludge (including feces) and compost are often used as inoculation microorganisms in biofilters (from Table 1), the biofilters as a potential source of the human epidemic virus can not be ignored.",

Nicolella et al. (1996) also demonstrated that the detachment rate was strongly increased with superficial velocity. High gas velocity is not suitable for microbe aggregation, causing microbe slough off from carriers to the airflow. The thickness of the biofilm also became thin under these conditions (Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012a). When the gas velocity reaches a certain flow rate, the biofilm would not fall off with the increase of gas velocity.

Therefore bioaerosol emissions from biofilters are generally higher than background values, which would cause lung disease and inflammation, and pose a great potential threat to human health. Additionally, many factors influence the emissions of bioaerosols during biofiltration. High biomass accumulation results in high concentrations of bioaerosol emissions. Increasing gas velocity will raise the bioaerosol emissions first and then decrease the concentrations due to the shearing force and dilution effect. High moisture content and temperatures will reduce bioaerosol emissions and have an impact on bioaerosol species. As for bioaerosols control technologies, UV, H2O2, and O3 are applicable for its low energy consumption and high inactivation efficiency. Also, PCD is a very promising technology for controlling bioaerosol because of the less secondary pollution generation and high inactivation efficiency.",
