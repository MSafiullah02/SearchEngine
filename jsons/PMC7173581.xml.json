Children contract up to half a dozen respiratory illnesses each year, adults perhaps two or three, and most of these are caused by viruses. Though trivial colds and sore throats account for the majority of respiratory disease, their impact on communities is significant; millions of lost working hours and a considerable proportion of all visits to family physicians can be attributed to this type of infection. More serious lower respiratory tract infections tend to occur at the extremes of life, and in those with pre-existing pulmonary conditions.\nThe most important human respiratory viruses are influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), the former killing mainly the aged and the latter the very young. Of the estimated 5 million deaths from respiratory infections in children annually worldwide, at least one million are viral in origin.",

Colds are not common in Arctic or Antarctic explorers, for example.\nIt seems more likely that the striking winter peaks of respiratory disease caused by influenza and RSV (Fig. 1) are a reflection of our predilection during that season for avoiding the invigorating outdoor climate and shutting ourselves away in ill-ventilated centrally-heated buildings and vehicles, in close apposition to others of like mind. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that in the tropics, where summer and winter are replaced by \u2018wet\u2019 and \u2018dry\u2019 seasons, respiratory infections are more prevalent during the monsoonal rains when people spend more time indoors, exchanging parasites in crowded, often squalid conditions. An additional factor in the less developed world is the domestic air pollution (smoke) generated by the ever-present fire, lit for cooking and warmth inside poorly ventilated huts. Outbreaks of influenza often occur in boarding schools, army camps, nursing homes, etc.; similarly, nosocomial spread of RSV is common in hospital nurseries. Livestock such as cattle are particularly vulnerable when crowded together in feed-lots or transport vehicles, e.g. shipping fever.\n",

Any spontaneously arising mutant that is capable of replicating in the presence of antibody against the wild-type virus will have a growth advantage. Eventually mutants emerge that contain amino acid substitutions in most or all of the immunodominant antigenic domains on the critical surface protein of the virion. Such multiple mutants, no longer neutralizable by wild-type antibody, are designated a new strain and may initiate another epidemic.\nThis phenomenon is known as antigenic drift. While best characterized for influenza, it is presumably the mechanism that has also given rise to the dozens of known serotypes of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and so on. A second, more dramatic type of change, known as antigenic shift, is observed in RNA viruses with segmented genomes that can undergo genetic reassortment. Novel subtypes of human influenza A viruses, capable of initiating pandemics that can infect the majority of the world\u2019s population within a year, arise every generation or so as a result of reassortment following co-infection of, say, a pig with a human and an avian influenza virus simultaneously.",

Many of these particles become trapped in the layer of mucus that blankets the ciliated epithelium and are carried by ciliary action to the pharynx, where they are swallowed or coughed out. Smaller particles still can be inhaled directly into the lung and some may reach the alveoli. Here, virus may be phagocytosed and destroyed by alveolar macrophages (although some viral species undergo an abortive cycle of replication and others have developed the capacity to replicate in macrophages).\nA few virions will succeed in attaching to susceptible epithelial cells via the appropriate ligand\u2013receptor pairing and thereby initiate infection. Progeny virions will be released a few hours later, often by budding from the apical surface of the cell into the lumen of the respiratory tract, and then initiate a second cycle of infection in adjacent or more distant cells. Some of the enveloped species of respiratory viruses are dependent upon a particular cellular protease to cleave the appropriate viral envelope glycoprotein, e.g. influenza HA, or RSV F protein, otherwise the progeny are noninfectious. Moreover, mucus contains glycoprotein inhibitors which can neutralize the infectivity of certain viruses, e.g. influenza. Mannose-binding lectins such as those in lung surfactant can also neutralize virus. Interferon, synthesized by and secreted from virus-infected cells, binds to interferon receptors on nearby uninfected cells and protects them by inhibiting viral replication.\n",

In the absence of pre-existing antibody, however, infection can progress because primary antibody synthesis does not become significant for several days. Additional mechanisms are brought into play to control viral replication during this early period, with the first cells to be mobilized being the natural killer (NK) cells from bone marrow, which become activated by interferon (IFN) to lyse virus-infected cells. Shortly thereafter, the relevant clones of T lymphocytes are activated.\nHelper T (Th) cells (CD4+) recognize peptides generated from endocytosed virions by proteolysis and presented in the peptide-binding groove of the class II major histocompatability complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) and are triggered to proliferate and to secrete a range of lymphokines that mediate inflammation by attracting macrophages and other leukocytes to the site, and by upregulating macrophages, B cells and T cells.

CD4+ T cells also contribute to the process of recovery by secretion of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and through provision of help to B cells in the developing humoral response. Specific antibodies may act by (1) neutralizing virus, (2) complement-mediated lysis of infected cells, or (3) antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytolysis (ADCC).

Multiple target (multiplex) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of the viral genome, followed by its identification using an appropriate nucleic acid probe, is fast becoming popular as a diagnostic technique for respiratory infections and in epidemiologic investigations.",

            "text": "Most of the known respiratory viruses can quite readily be cultivated in appropriate cell lines from the corresponding host species, e.g. diploid lung fibroblasts or HUT-292 cells for human viruses. Growth of the virus is detected by cytopathic effects and/or hemadsorption or immunofluorescence, and the virus recovered from the supernatant is then typed using any of a variety of serological techniques. However, this sequence is so time consuming and expensive that isolation and identification of virus is today undertaken mainly by reference laboratories requiring a large supply of the virus for further characterization, for research, or for antigen or vaccine production. Viral culture nevertheless remains a vital first step in the identification of agents responsible for newly emerging diseases.",

            "text": "Very successful live attenuated vaccines are in general use against certain \u2018respiratory\u2019 viruses like measles, mumps and rubella, which, though naturally transmitted via the respiratory route, are absolutely dependent upon viremic spread to their target organs elsewhere in the body. In contrast, it is a much more challenging assignment to develop effective vaccines against viruses whose pathogenicity is essentially confined to the respiratory tract. The major reasons for this are that (1) secretory IgA memory is relatively short-lived, and (2) numerous antigenically distinct strains or serotypes are capable of causing the same clinical syndrome. Thus, a common cold vaccine might need to contain dozens of different serotypes of rhinoviruses (\u00b1 coronaviruses). An inactivated vaccine is used to protect the aged and other risk groups against the currently prevalent strains of influenza, but its composition must be updated regularly to keep abreast of antigenic drift and shift and, even so, its efficacy in the aged is only of the order of 50\u201380%. The incorporation into vaccines of mucosal adjuvants, e.g. low-toxicity mutants or individual subunits of cholera toxin and Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin, is being examined in the hope of stimulating potent antiviral mucosal IgA responses. Improved antigen-delivery strategies, many of which utilize the size and multivalent antigen presentation properties of the viruses themselves, are also being investigated. Immunostimulatory complexes or \u2018ISCOMs\u2019, which are small adjuvant- and lipid-containing particles into which viral proteins can be inserted, already form the basis for an equine influenza vaccine. Live \u2018cold-adapted\u2019 mutants, for many years licensed as influenza vaccines in Russia, replicate only at the low temperature of the nose and are generally avirulent. Although it has proven difficult to walk the tightrope between genetic stability of avirulence on the one side, and adequate replication (hence immunogenicity) on the other, there is currently considerable interest in re-exploring the potential of such viral mutants for intranasal vaccination in other parts of the world.\nAnother potentially exciting vaccine strategy is the use of recombinant DNA encoding the vaccine antigen, delivered in the form of a plasmid by syringe or \u2018gene gun\u2019. Such vaccines, encoding the nucleoprotein and hemagglutinin of influenza A virus, have successfully elicited protective responses in animals. Subsequent efforts in this area include methods for enhancing the efficiency of transfection of host cells to increase the feasibility of application in humans.",

            "text": "In the long term another source of hope may lie with antiviral chemotherapeutic agents (see Antivirals), although significant barriers still remaining are (1) the multiplicity of viruses involved and the specific antiviral spectrum of available agents; (2) difficulties with drug delivery, efficacy and toxicity; (3) the fact that high titers of virus may be produced even before the onset of symptoms; and (4) emergence of drug-resistant mutants. Since the discovery of interferon in 1957, the field of antiviral chemotherapy has moved slowly. Although IFN-\u03b1 is effective when given intranasally shortly before or after virus exposure, its use is not practical because of cost of production, frequency of doses required and problems with local bleeding and discharge.\nThe only agents currently in use against respiratory viruses are (1) amantadine and its methylated derivative rimantadine, which display activity against influenza A if given prophylactically and act by interfering with the ion flux mediated by the M2 channel-forming protein of the virus, thereby inhibiting its uncoating; and (2) ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, which may be of value in severely ill infants with RSV bronchiolitis/pneumonia when administered as a small-particle aerosol.\nMore recently, thanks to x-ray diffraction and cryoelectron microscopy techniques, sites on viral proteins essential for interaction with the host cell receptor or otherwise critical to the infectious process can be visualized. From this has blossomed the age of computer-aided drug design for the development of antivirals. Among the compounds already in clinical trial are those that block the enzyme active site of influenza neuraminidase, a glycoprotein whose role is to facilitate the release of progeny virions from infected cells and prevent self-aggregation of the virus. Others target a small hydrophobic pocket within the canyon region of the coat proteins of rhinoviruses; these drugs stabilize the coat proteins, thereby preventing uncoating and release of viral RNA for replication. Viral mutants resistant to these drugs can be derived in the laboratory but their significance in vivo remains to be established.",
