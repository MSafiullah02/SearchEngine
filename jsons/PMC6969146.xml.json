Each individual epitope in a chimeric polypeptide vaccine may provide a high efficacy vaccine by inducing and enhancing robust and specific humoral responses in addition to other cellular responses, particularly opsonization activity20. Moreover, proper linkers have been considered to minimize steric hindrance of each chimeric epitope and enhance epitope presentation to the host immune system21.",

Moreover, this vaccine type is more efficient than whole antigens for controlling Staphylococcus spp. infections20,30. From the present study, linear B cell epitope prediction was assessed and identified 11 potent epitopes from 5 common immunogenic and virulence proteins that were present in serotypes Ia and III. The previous studies supported that one of the chosen proteins, Sip, represented a highly conserved protein among GBS isolates and showed cross-protective immunity against GBS infections11,13,14,31. Prediction of candidate antigenic proteins can be used to select the bacterial strains that carry antigenic genes, as well as to determine high expression levels in the target host and the accessibility of particular antigens in host organisms16.

In addition to the \u03b1/\u03b2-type folding of flavodoxin, it was also useful to construct our chimeric multiepitope vaccine by forcing the 5 chosen epitope segments to fit within 5 \u03b1-helix loops and protrude out of the 3D-folded structure since that configuration benefits protein solubility by exposure to water molecules23. Additionally, this linker may promote the solubility of the constructed vaccine and help enhance the recognition of the vaccine by the host\u2019s immune system, which contributes to vaccine efficacy. 45F2 and 42E2 presented the most favored region of protein folding, with the stereochemical quality representing the disallowed region at only 0.7%, which is acceptable since the minimum quality should be less than 2%32.

However, it is known that single-serotype whole-cell inactivated vaccines have limitations during cross-prevention against different serotypes. For instance, a S. iniae vaccine (serotype I) could not protect Atlantic salmon from infection by S. iniae (serotype II)39. Meanwhile, mixed-serotype vaccines (serotypes IV and VII) could promote antiserum levels and enhance the survival rate of newborn pups against streptococcal infection40. Although formalin-killed vaccines generally provide highly protective effects compared with those of subunit vaccines and DNA vaccines, the subunit and DNA vaccines may replace the original formalin-killed vaccines or inactivated vaccines due to their promising efficacy, which are similar to those of inactivated vaccines, and longer shelf life18,33. Evidence suggests that DNA and subunit vaccines can efficiently trigger the immune system and promote protective efficacy, with an RPS value greater than 50%11,13,14,17. Nevertheless, these vaccines have limitations, such as their mass production costs, and they may require various optimizations to obtain the highest stable storage conditions18,41.",

            "text": "Regarding this idea, a chimeric multiepitope vaccine composed of different epitopes from different proteins common in both serotypes Ia and III was generated to achieve broad protection against different serotypes and increase their stability. Interestingly, the designed chimeric multiepitope DNA vaccine and protein vaccine exhibited effective prevention in Nile tilapia against S. agalactiae, with efficacy similar to that of the whole-cell inactivated vaccine. This evidence supports the strategy of rational vaccine design through B cell recognition using in silico analysis. Importantly, immunoproteomics analysis could assist the preliminary determination of suitable immunogenic proteins for vaccine development due to the distinct antigenic determinants that can mediate dissimilar immune responses. The criterion in immunogenic protein selection for vaccine development has focused on the ability of a particular protein to induce an immune response. Among 79 identified proteins shared in both serotypes, in addition to providing the highest BCPRED scores (Table 1), the 5 proteins chosen were also reported as virulence proteins and used as vaccine candidates for streptococcosis disease prevention13. For example, C-\u03b2 protein (BAC) can lead to antibody production through Fc region binding of human IgA42. Sip protein has been shown to mediate protection against streptococcal infection11,13,14. Additionally, the chosen immunogenic protein should be conserved among Streptococcus spp., so it would be suitable for application in cross-reactive prevention among S. agalactiae serotypes11,43. Moreover, it should be mentioned that peptide vaccines or epitopes with only 30 amino acid residues may trigger immune responses through binding directly to MHC-I or MHC-II molecules. These molecules localize to nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells. Vaccines containing proteins with longer amino acid sequences can enhance the presentation of epitopes to dendritic cells due to T cell induction25,44,45. Herein, the comparative efficacy of both the 45F2 and 42E2 DNA and recombinant protein vaccines indicated that the DNA vaccine provided a higher efficacy than the recombinant protein vaccine. This result suggests that the DNA vaccine can prolong the activation of the immune response by triggering both humoral and cellular immune responses46,47. Moreover, the clearance rate of the recombinant protein vaccine in the host system may be faster than that of the DNA vaccine. This difference implies that the DNA vaccine can enter the host cell to produce chimeric multiepitope protein, with that protein existing in the host system for longer than the recombinant protein vaccine, thus enhancing its bioavailability.",

This research demonstrated a novel platform for rational vaccine design based on chimeric vaccine development that used flavodoxin with a Tim-barrel structure as a template. Our chimeric protein backbone is suitable for presenting epitopes to be recognized by the host immune system. With 5 epitopes, it could activate antibody production and demonstrated promising protection against bacterial disease similar to that of a whole-cell inactivated vaccine. This platform will promote the production of multivalent vaccines to control multiple diseases and for other applications in the future.",
