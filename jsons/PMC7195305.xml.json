In the present study, the Ct values of the E gene assay were consistently lower than the corresponding values in the RdRp assay in SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 cultures and synthetic positive controls, highlighting the superior sensitivity of the E gene assay as a screening test.",

The use of sequencing (although valuable for confirmation of NAT) in the diagnostic algorithm increases laboratory turnaround times and may not be ideal when there are substantial numbers of specimens that require testing. Furthermore, although sequencing may be used to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of newly developed tests for novel pathogens, this technology may not be readily available in all diagnostic laboratories. The use of sequencing can assist with investigation of cases with no clear links at a local level and sharing of sequencing data to platforms such as GISAID can contribute to the understanding of the viral evolution.",

This discrepant result may reflect differences in sampling quality or progression of infection from the URT to the LRT, and supports the recommendations to test LRT samples where available [PHLN], similar to our previous experience with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [9]. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in LRT samples is suggestive of active viral replication within the LRT, particularly in patients with deteriorating respiratory function and abnormal radiological imaging. Together with Ct values, this may be useful in guiding the clinical management of such patients. The significance of viral co-infection in COVID-19 disease on clinical outcomes is unknown. Other samples where SARS-CoV-2 have been detected by NATs include saliva, stool, rectal swabs and urine [CCDC, To].",

Further data are awaited regarding the use of assays with different SARS-CoV-2 targets, viral loads and kinetics to better guide individual patient management and infection control measures. The optimal testing algorithm to detect SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostic pathology providers and public health reference laboratories will depend on their healthcare systems, laboratory capacity and capability, particularly with the anticipated substantial increase in testing demands as the epidemic progresses and revised case definitions broaden the indications for testing.",
