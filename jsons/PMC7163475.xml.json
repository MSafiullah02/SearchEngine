In 54 patients admitted to hospital suspected of SARS, absolute lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in the confirmed SARS group than in the non\u2010SARS group. With a cut off of \u2264 1.0, the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves was 0.937 (95% CI = 0.835\u20130.984). The sensitivity and specificity for disease were 84.6% (95% CI = 65.1\u201395.5) and 89.3% (95% CI = 71.7\u201397.6). The positive predictive value was 88.0% and the negative predictive value was 86.2%. Absolute lymphocyte counts taken on the first day of admission to hospital may be useful in predicting SARS.",

Clinical data on presentation included cough, diarrhoea, chills, malaise and myalgia. White cell count and absolute lymphocyte counts were collected on the day of admission, whilst PCR results performed on samples taken up to 21 days after onset of symptoms for coronavirus were also recorded. Patients were then divided into two groups: confirmed SARS and non\u2010SARS.
