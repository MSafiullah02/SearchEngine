The speed and severity of the pandemic has taken us all by surprise, priorities have shifted and the balance of risks has changed. Things that seemed to be of the greatest importance only a few weeks ago have been swept away. Practice environments have changed almost beyond recognition, especially in hospitals, and a heightened sense of urgency and even fear can, understandably, predominate. The public health and medical imperative is such that there is a perception that the needs, preferences and decisions of childbearing women and even their rights and those of their babies are less important or even irrelevant (Birthrights, 2020).",

Making swift, if well intentioned, changes without evidence of effectiveness may lead to unanticipated consequences which could seriously compromise the quality of care and outcomes. Maternity workload pressures have increased as a result of the pandemic. Staff have had to self-isolate to protect their own health or when family members are infected. The priority of keeping women and babies \u2013 and staff - safe in a pandemic means that we must have the ability to balance the restrictions required to control the spread of infection with the essential, evidence-informed principles of safe, effective, equitable, respectful, kind and compassionate care (Renfrew et al., 2014). Is this a dilemma? No, there must be no trade-off between protecting the health and wellbeing of midwives and other health workers, and the rights of women and babies. Both are imperative. If we fail there is a real risk that the safety and rights of women and babies will be seriously compromised (Human Rights Watch, 2020; International Confederation of Midwives, 2020a; International Confederation of Midwives, 2020b).",

We present a set of core principles that should be at the heart of care planning and delivery both during and after the pandemic.",

A constant stream of information from countries with experience of this virus is now helping to inform policy and practice. New decisions are being made every day and guidelines are being developed and updated at pace e.g (Royal College of Midwives and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2020c,2020b; Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2020; World Health Organisation, 2020c). The scale and scope of new collaborations and structures is unprecedented and every aspect of health care is now viewed through a COVID-19 specific lens.",

            "text": "In the UK, guidelines have been changing rapidly and circumstances vary from region to region, but in the immediate response phase a number of recommended changes were implemented across the country that significantly changed practice and imposed restrictions on services, staff, and women. Services have had to be reconfigured to cope with staff shortages of an average of 20%, up to 40% in some areas (Royal College of Midwives, 2020d) as a result of staff sickness and self-isolation on top of existing workforce constraints. Concerns were initially expressed that maternity staff in the UK might be redeployed to general nursing roles, potentially further depleting already stretched maternity services (NHS England, 2020; Royal College of Midwives, 2020c). Some non-acute, but important, services such as antenatal and postnatal care were changed to virtual delivery, and infant feeding services were closed and replaced with virtual support, much of it from voluntary groups (Royal College of Midwives, 2020c). There was pressure to close or seriously limit provision of community services despite important lessons from other countries indicating that community based care is likely to be safer (Nacoti et al., 2020; Renfrew et al., 2020). Restrictions were imposed on births at home and in freestanding midwifery units in some areas (Summers, 2020), and as a consequence, more women are being cared for in hospital settings. Continuity of care schemes were closed in some areas. Companionship in labour was restricted. There were reports of babies being separated from their mothers, not always for justifiable reasons (Baker, 2020; Brown, 2020). Ancillary services such as ambulances were focussed on patients with COVID-19, and there have been concerns over their availability for emergency maternity transfers. Perhaps unsurprisingly given this context, there have been reports of increased anxiety in pregnant women and in women planning to have unassisted childbirth (\u2018freebirth\u2019) (Tull, 2020).",

In this fast-changing, frightening situation, where staff are in short supply and there seems little or no time to weigh up options, it is not surprising that the immediate reaction may be to revert to old patterns of command and control. This could be described as default or status-quo bias (Kahneman et al.,1982). It is not a helpful response, however, for the short and the longer-term safety, health and wellbeing for women, babies, families, or, indeed for staff and students. Any restrictive practices that are being implemented run counter to the knowledge that safety has physical, psychological, social, cultural, and spiritual dimensions (Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2019).",

In the early days of the pandemic when maternity-specific COVID-19 guidance was unavailable, recourse to these decision-making strategies was the immediate response. While intuitive, tacit knowledge can serve us well in familiar situations the risk is that in these uncharted times the whole system reverts to old patterns of behaviour; in this case, risk-averse and intervention-orientated patterns that run counter to current evidence become predominant. Centralising services and limiting women's options risks returning us to the institutionalised, routine-led focus that predominated in the later 20th Century, or taking us into new patterns of following infection control-led regulations. Developing new practices quickly in the absence of evidence, such as remote and digital consultation, and even home-based electronic fetal monitoring (US Food and Drug Administration, 2020; Van Den Heuvel et al., 2020), goes against the grain of evidence-informed practice and risks unanticipated adverse consequences.",

We know and understand the key components of good quality, safe care that improve the survival, health and wellbeing of women and newborn infants (Renfrew et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2016; World Health Organisation, 2016, 2018a, 2018b). But these practices may be under threat in some areas as system-wide responses to the pandemic are implemented (Rocca-Ihenacho and Alonso, 2020). Focussing primarily on interventions, important as those can be, risks losing many of the elements of care that make a difference to the safety, health and well-being of women and babies. The loss of key evidence-informed aspects of safe, quality care will have long-lasting consequences for individuals, families, and wider society. These aspects may include continuity of care and carer; community-based services; midwifery-led, women-centred and individualised care that takes into account the context of women's lives; provision of public health information and support; optimising normal processes; avoiding unnecessary interventions; promoting skin-to-skin contact and attachment; enabling women to breastfeed; and supporting women's mental health (Turnbull et al., 1996; Begley et al., 2011; Birthplace in England Collaborative Group, 2011; Renfrew et al., 2014; Balogun et al., 2016; Sandall et al., 2016; Jaafar, Ho and Lee, 2016; Miller et al., 2016; Moore et al., 2016; Homer et al., 2017; McFadden et al., 2017; Stuebe, 2020; Birth Companions, 2020). Mental health is already likely to be adversely affected by the anxiety and fear generated by the coronavirus, so it is especially important not to aggravate this for women, or for staff, by unnecessary and potentially adverse changes to services (Maternal Mental Health Alliance, 2020).",

We need to guard against unintended adverse consequences. Centralising services in hospitals may reduce women's access to care, lose the benefits of community-based care, and increase exposure to infection for women, families, and midwives (Rocca-Ihenacho and Alonso, 2020). Returning to fragmented care loses the key safety attributes of continuity, in particular for the vulnerable women experiencing multiple disadvantage who may fall though the net (Birth Companions, 2020). Denying women companionship throughout labour will result in increased interventions, increased length of hospital stay, and increased exposure of women and staff to cross-infection (Lavender et al., 2020). Separating women and babies increases the risks of other infections, interferes with breastfeeding and skin-to-skin care, and loses the essential short- and long-term physiological and psychological benefits of mother-baby contact (Oddy et al., 2010; Howard et al., 2011; Azad, 2019). It is vitally important that the postnatal service is not further weakened or fragmented while COVID is made an excuse for doing so; rather, women's need for postnatal care and support is likely to increase at this time of social isolation. The increased workload, anxiety, and stress that staff face every day is likely to be detrimental to their own physical and mental health and result in burnout and deteriorating workplace behaviours if measures are not put in place to prevent this (O'Connell et al., 2020).",

Guidelines are becoming less restrictive and lessons are being learned to identify effective strategies (Royal College of Midwives and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2020a). There are emerging reports that high quality, easily accessible virtual postnatal and breastfeeding support may be effective and welcomed by many women. Innovative solutions will be needed \u2013 and some are already evolving - to solve the challenges of emergency transport and workforce shortages, and to continue to provide the information, care and support that women need throughout their childbearing journey (Haines et al., 2020). More widespread testing will help to inform levels of infection risk for staff and students and a population-based approach for women, newborn infants, and families.",

Some staff will themselves be pregnant, have older or vulnerable family members, or child care responsibilities, or be of a Black, Asian and minority ethnic group (BAME), which evidence shows makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19 (Aldridge et al., 2020). Strict hygiene measures that restrict birth companionship and keep mother and baby apart may make some staff safer \u2013 and feel safer. The moral distress of not being able to give the quality of care they know is needed, however, and of witnessing the distress of the mother, birth companion, and family, and of knowing their care could contribute to sub-optimal experiences and outcomes, is also a vital safety consideration for staff and students (Greenberg et al., 2020).

How do they, and the health professionals who work with them, consider services should best be organised to keep people safe, considering physical, psychological, social, cultural, and spiritual aspects of safety? Research is needed to understand and mitigate the appalling impact that the pandemic has had upon the BAME community, including those in the healthcare workforce (Bailey and West, 2020). Participation, consultation, and listening to women and staff remain as relevant now as they were before this pandemic started (Renfrew et al., 2008; NHS England, 2016). The early results of the UKOSS COVID-19 in pregnancy study have recently been published (Knight et al., 2020; https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/ukoss/current-surveillance/COVID-19-in-pregnancy). They strengthen the previous observation that people from BAME groups are most at risk, and provide new knowledge to help plan services. Further findings from UKOSS and other studies are needed to identify the changes to systems of care that matter to women, families, and to midwives and their ability to provide quality midwifery care (Kennedy et al., 2016, 2018).",
