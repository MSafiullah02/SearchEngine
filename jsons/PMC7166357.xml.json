These data are interesting for the characterization of monkeys as an object in medical\u2010biological research. Also, they are important for preventing epizooty and infection of personnel contacting with monkeys in a monkey colony. The characterization of spontaneous infections in monkeys is very important for further use of monkeys as models of analogous human infections. The similar to human manifestations of the most part of these infections can be reproduced in monkeys that is explained by evolutionary established similarity of main physiological systems of monkeys and humans. The evolutional similarity of infectious agents, seemingly duplicates of human viruses, should be also taken into account. The contribution made by monkeys to research of human virus pathology is invaluable. The use of these laboratory primates helped to prove etiology of the most part of viral infections, to study their pathogenesis and epidemiology, and to develop the preventive care.",

Main manifestations of the infection were hemorrhagic diathesis and damage of neurological status.4, 5, 6 Clinical signs were also fever, apathy, anorexia, tremor, ataxia, limb weakness (rarely, pareses). There was an increase in tendon reflexes and muscular tone. Most animals had petechial skin rash, more rarely \u2010 nosebleed and intestinal bleeding. In the terminal period, temperature and blood pressure drastically decreased. Monkeys died in 8\u201012 days. Disorder of blood circulation in the microcirculatory bloodstream, hemorrhagic diathesis in the central nervous system, diffuse encephalomyelitis, widespread destruction of lymphoid elements and focal coagulative necroses in parenchymatous organs were histologically observed. From the blood and brain, a filterable agent was isolated.6, 7 The virus differed from known causative agents of hemorrhagic fevers. He was apathogenic for small laboratory animals, did not possess hemagglutinating properties, and did not reproduce itself in any of 39 cell cultures. Only rhesus macaque embryonic kidney cells (PEMR) were permissive. Immunotyping showed that it was the new virus different from ones known earlier.6, 7 Virus strain discovered by Z.V. Shevtsova in 1964 and designated as \u201cSukhumi\u201064\u201d was registered at the State collection of viruses of the USSR Ministry of Public Health. The certificate was signed by Dr. V.M. Zhdanov, the member of International committee on taxonomy and classification of viruses. Two years later after our first communications,4, 5 American scientists reported that an enzooty of similar disease took place in the NIH rhesus macaque colony in Bethesda at the end of 1964.8 The isolated virus strain was designated as Bethesda 64.9 After exchange of virus strains between USSR and United States, it was found that viruses were antigenically similar but not identical.10, 11 Another 2 outbreaks were observed in the Sukhumi colony in 1967 and 1974. The infection source was African patas monkeys carrying latent infection and located in the same room as Asian macaques. SHF was the serious problem of primatological centers: 17 enzooties were registered by 1996.12 In some colonies, a number of died macaques was from 200 to 500.13 Later, SHV\u2010related variants were isolated from African monkeys of various species from wild animals as well as from those habitating in National parks. Today, 12 isolates are studied in detail by American and Russian virologists. All of them are arteriviruses, but differ by their genome structures and homology. The strain \u201cSukhumi\u201064\u201d was included in genus Arteriviruses as Sukhumi simarterivirus species called simian hemorrhagic encephalitis virus (SHEV).

Death of these cells leads to release of tissue procoagulant and blood coagulation increase. The first stage of hypercoagulation is followed by hypocoagulation. The coagulation profiles are similar to profiles at disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome.34 Analogous data were obtained by a number of authors during Ebola hemorrhagic fever research: virus tropism to endothelial cells and to macrophages, and coagulation damage is a result of virus tropism to cells of the monocyte\u2010macrophage system.35 Comparison of our results with literature data showed that general pathophysiological mechanisms underlie the pathogenesis of various hemorrhagic fevers.
