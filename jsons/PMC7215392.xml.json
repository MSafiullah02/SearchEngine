The sustainable development process consists of three main aspects, namely the environment, economy, and society, with the government policies to be considered as the fourth important aspect of this process from the current decade onwards [1,2]. Although the sustainable development process has a specific framework, there are many serious problems in implementing its process, and epidemic diseases are examples of this kind of problem, which can lead to temporary or permanent barriers and could affect the previous attempts on different criteria of sustainable development [3,4].",

They found out that this virus can survive up for to 9 days [11]. Chinazzi et al. (2020) investigated the impact of travel restrictions on the spread of COVID-19. Their results show that travel restrictions can be very useful in decreasing the transmission of disease in the community [12]. Nkengasong and Mankoula (2020) evaluated the looming threat of COVID-19 from China to Africa. They investigated ways of transmitting the disease like trade between China and Africa, and also considered health-care systems. The obtained results show that for preventing a major disaster, Africa needs to be supported collectively, and fast [13].",

Many studies have been carried out in various fields of science to obtain mathematical models and solutions for determining problems [53,54,55]. To be able to develop a prediction model, one method can be regression analysis. By regression analysis, the effect of two or more variables on the dependent variable can be assessed. Multivariate linear regression (MLR) is one of the most applicable mathematical methods to determine a linear relationship between independent and dependent parameters [56,57]. The MLR model for the ith sample is as Equation (1):yi = \u03b20 + \u03b21xi1 + \u03b22xi2 +\u2026+ \u03b2jxin + \u03b5i(1)\nwhere:\u03b5 is random error\u03b2i, (i = 0, 1, \u2026, n) are the regression coefficients",

Moreover, there are two other reasons for delays, each of about one day, namely the delay in knowing the results of the laboratory analysis and the 24 hour delay between the confirmation of the infection and its announcement. After consideration of the impacts during nine days, the best combination was determined, and the final MLR model was developed accordingly. Comparisons between the final multivariate equations we obtained and previous ones by R2, and the coefficients and significance level of the constant show that accuracy was improved by the proposed method.

They present the best combination of all factors in prediction, not each of them separately. Therefore, the impact of one can overcome the other. For example, a wind with very high speed might be dominant with respect to a small decrease in average temperature. In addition, the developed prediction equations are based on the dataset of three case studies that were in an increasing trend of positive cases of COVID-19. Therefore, they cannot be used to predict the behavior of positive case in a future decreasing trend. However, the same delays for the impact of climate factors would also exist in a decreasing trend. As mentioned in [22], due to the incubation period of COVID-19, which is about 2\u201314 days, it should be expected that the increasing trend would stop in a period, which, according to Chinese experience, would be expected to be about 13 days from the starting date of full lockdown. However, in the Italian case, it will probably last longer because of the different features of the lockdown implementation. Finally, to improve the accuracy of the prediction, the same analysis with the mentioned condition and by consideration of delays are suggested for future studies using MnLR and artificial intelligence techniques.",

The results of MLP for three case studies in Italy showed a high accuracy correlation between the variables and observations. However, the accuracy changed by shifting the impact time. The results of the analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the impact of climate parameters on the trend of confirmed cases. The results of shifting the variables with respect to confirmed cases demonstrate that there is a delay from four to eight days between the impact of weather parameters and the new confirmed cases. The reason could be the fact that the positive cases are among those with symptoms, and the symptoms of COVID-19 occur after about 3 to 5 days, and there are also two other delays, each of about one day, including the results of the laboratory analysis and the announced time that belongs to the previous 24 h. Comparisons between the final developed MLR and the first ones showed an improvement in the accuracy of the proposed technique. According to the trend analysis, it seems that the population density and weather conditions could affect the daily positive cases of COVID-19. The fluctuations of daily positive cases in all three case studies confirmed the impact of climate factors with some delay and proved the results of MLR. As a result, the developed prediction model can be applied as an assessment method for investigating the impact of climate and urban parameters in confirmed cases of COVID-19.",
