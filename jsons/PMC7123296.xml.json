            "text": "\nHPV is a DNA virus that causes common warts, anogenital warts, and a number of cancers in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. It has more than 100 types. Several of the manifestations of HPV infection and their associated HPV types are presented in Table 13.1. Cutaneous warts include deep plantar warts, common warts, and plane or flat warts. Anogenital HPV infections, including condyloma acuminata, are the most commonly acquired viral sexually transmitted infections. Notably, there is a strong association between HPV and development of malignancy, including cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx, among other locations. Gardisil (Merck, West Point, PA) and Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) are two recombinant HPV vaccines that have been developed to prevent HPV-associated anogenital warts, dysplasia, and cancers in males and females via the production of neutralizing antibodies. Gardisil is indicated for males and females between the ages of 9 and 26 years. Initially, Garidisil was a quadrivalent vaccine, protecting against HPV serotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18. More recently, five additional serotypes have been added to the recombinant vaccine. Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials examined the efficacy of quadrivalent Gardisil for prevention of HPV-associated disease in females aged 16\u201326 years. Per-protocol data from these trials showed an efficacy against HPV 6-, 11-, 16- and 18-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 of 98.2% and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 of 100%. Efficacy against HPV 6- and 11-associated genital warts was 98.9%. Of note, in the trials assessing females with HPV vaccine type detected at study enrollment, there was no change in progression to disease with administration of the vaccine. In males aged 16\u201326 years, quadrivalent Gardisil was shown in one trial to have a per-protocol efficacy against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related genital warts of 89.4%.\n\n",

            "text": "\nRespiratory papillomas are the most common benign laryngeal tumor in children. Juvenile recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is typically identified between the ages of 2 and 3 years and is related to acquisition of HPV during passage through the birth canal of an infected mother. Risk factors for development of RRP include being a firstborn child, which often implies longer labor, having a teenage mother with genital condylomata, and having a mother with a lower socioeconomic status. RRP is caused most commonly by HPV types 6 and 11 and less commonly by type 16. The estimated incidence of juvenile RRP is 4.3 per 100,000 children. RRP can cause obstruction of the larynx, which can lead to hoarseness and respiratory difficulty. Laryngoscopy will often reveal multiple verrucous growths along the true vocal cords, along the false vocal cords, in the subglottic region, and in the trachea.",

            "text": "Many children with RRP will require multiple procedures to excise the papillomas. Often, the lesions will diminish around puberty. Rarely, the papillomas can spread into the lower respiratory tract and undergo malignant transformation. Multiple therapies have been attempted for RRP, including interferon, photodynamic therapy, ribavirin, acyclovir, intralesional and intravenous cidofovir, intralesional mumps vaccine, bevacizumab, and others. Systemic therapy should be considered when the patient requires more than four surgical interventions per year, when there is evidence of spread to the lungs, when the papillomas are noted to regrow rapidly after excision, and when there is airway obstruction. Approximately 10% of patients with RRP will require systemic therapy. \u03b1-interferon is the most common systemic therapy utilized in patients with RRP. It is believed to trigger a host immune response that inhibits viral protein synthesis. However, responses have been mixed in the literature and there are tolerability concerns. Some experts recommend a trial of \u03b1-interferon for 6 months followed by an assessment of disease response before deciding to continue.\nKey Points/PearlsRecurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) of childhood is a disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), most often type 6 or 11, which is acquired during passage through the birth canal.RRP causes papilloma growth in the larynx and trachea and rarely can spread to the lower respiratory tract and undergo malignant transformation.RRP is often treated with local, intralesional therapy.Systemic therapy should be considered in patients who require multiple surgical interventions per year, when there is spread to the lungs, when the papillomas rapidly regrow after excision, and when there is airway obstruction.Although HPV 6 and 11 are considered low risk for malignancy, in RRP, they may cause squamous cell cancer of the lung as in this patient.Gardasil 9 includes HPV types 6 and 11 that are considered low risk for malignancy but cause genital warts and HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 that associated with high risk for cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer.HPV 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of all cervical cancers, and HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 cause about 15% of all cervical cancers.\n",
