Recent estimates suggest that annually air pollution in China kills > 1.5 million people each year, about 17% of the nation's annual deaths (Rohde and Muller, 2015). One component of air pollution, in particular, is of increasing concern to public health experts; compared to other components, ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) is able to penetrate deep into the lung and into the circulatory system (S Feng et al., 2016). Exposure to PM2.5 is associated with a wide range of diseases including cardiovascular and respiratory disease (Arnold, 2014). In 2013, the Global Burden of Disease group estimated that exposure to ambient PM2.5 to be the 12th leading risk factor for the global burden of disease and responsible for 2.9 million deaths and 69.7 million disability adjusted life-years, worldwide (Forouzanfar et al., 2015).",

Of particular concern, both nationally and globally, is the increasing threat posed by emerging infectious diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and the highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI]) in the Chinese population, both of which pose a significant public health threat (Wang et al., 2008). Few studies have examined the possible effect of ambient PM2.5 concentrations on risk of communicable disease in China, but those that have reported a positive association between ambient PM2.5 and localised transmission of influenza (Feng et al., 2016, Huang et al., 2016, Liang et al., 2014). However, until now there has been no large-scale examination of the association due to past unavailability of PM2.5 data and incident cases of influenza at the national level. Neither has there been any detailed exploration of the possible effect of temperature on the transmissibility by ambient PM2.5 of the influenza virus. In this study, we collected daily data on ambient PM2.5 levels, weather conditions and influenza incidence from 47 cities in China in order to reliably determine the association between PM2.5 and influenza incidence and the potential modification effects of ambient temperature on the relationship.",

As influenza is a notifiable disease (Class C), sentinel hospitals are required to collect nasopharyngeal swabs for each identified case which are subsequently sent to designated laboratories for virus isolation and further identification and results are submitted online within 24 h (Liang et al., 2014, Shu et al., 2010).",

To examine whether ambient temperature modified the associations between PM2.5 and influenza, a stratified analysis was conducted according to daily temperature (for cold days, moderate cold days, moderate hot days, and hot days), by including an interactive term between PM2.5 and temperature levels (as a categorical variable) in the city-specific regression model. The cold days, moderate cold days, moderate hot days, and hot days were classified by the quartile of 0\u20137 days' moving average of temperature in each city during the study period.

Our findings suggest that increased ambient PM2.5 concentrations are associated with incident case of influenza at lag days 2 and 3 and that the effect is most apparent at lag day 2 when using single lag models. There was also evidence of a negative interaction with temperature such that the association between PM2.5 and incident influenza was stronger at cooler temperatures.

Fine particles with viruses attached can also be inhaled resulting in the direct delivery of the viral agents to the respiratory epithelial cells (Chen et al., 2010, Jaspers et al., 2005). Other studies which have examined how PM2.5 exposure may impact on respiratory function and the inflammatory response, have reported that exposure to PM2.5 is associated with dysfunction of the pulmonary tracheal cilia and decreased activity of alveolar macrophages (Wong et al., 2009, Xing et al., 2016) which in turn may enhance an individual's susceptibility to viral agents.",

Air pollution exhibits a similar seasonal variation to influenza outbreaks; for example, in winter, higher concentrations of PM2.5 have been reported possibly due to increased human activity and domestic heating leading to increased emissions (Kulshrestha, Satsangi, Masih, and Taneja, 2009). Several studies have reported that ambient temperature may modify the associations between air pollution and health (Kim et al., 2015, Stafoggia et al., 2008), but whether this is also true for influenza has not been hitherto investigated. In our study, we observed stronger associations at cold temperatures, whereas there was no effect of high temperatures on the magnitude of the association between PM2.5 and incident influenza. These results are consistent with earlier findings including the results of an experimental study that indicated that most frequent viral transmission occurred at 5 \u00b0C and was halted at 30 \u00b0C. It may be speculated that this reflects the inhibitory effect that cold air has on mucociliary clearance of the respiratory tract and greater viral stability in a low-temperature environment (Lowen, Mubareka, Steel, and Palese, 2007) both of which would enhance the transmissibility of the influenza virus. However, further studies are necessary before greater inference can be made.",

Influenza cases reported in the system were defined according to national criteria and identified by both routine clinical and laboratory examination. However, under-reporting of influenza cases may have occurred, as some individuals with influenza may not have attended hospital and therefore not been captured by the hospital reporting system (C Feng et al., 2016). Another limitation of the current study is that we did not have information on some demographic and behavioural factors \u2013 such as age, gender and cigarette smoking \u2013 which may be associated with incident influenza (Wang et al., 2016).

As a part of an integrated strategy for infectious disease control and prevention, the potential effect of environmental factors on disease transmission and infection should be taken into consideration. Findings from this study suggest that ambient PM2.5, particularly on cold days, increases the transmissibility of the influenza virus. Thus, following a period of heavy haze, preventive measures to prevent an increase in cases of influenza may be warranted both domestically and in neighbouring east Asian countries given the effect of emissions in China on surrounding countries (Kan, 2014).",
