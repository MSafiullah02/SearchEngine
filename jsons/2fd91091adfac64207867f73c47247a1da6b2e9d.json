Interfering with this process is a well-established therapeutic strategy [11] that has led to the development of the peptide fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (Fuzeon \u00ae , also known as T20, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), which is in clinical use for HIV [12] . Viral fusion is mediated by specialized proteins, which harbor a structural motif that consists of a repeating pattern of seven amino acids: the heptad repeat (HR). The most prevalent class (class I) of fusion proteins typically has two HR regions: the first one close to the N-terminus (HRN), adjacent to the fusion peptide, and the second one close to the C-terminus (HRC), immediately preceding the transmembrane domain. It is generally accepted that in the key intermediate of viral fusion, the so-called prehairpin intermediate, bridging the viral and cell membranes, the HRN and HRC regions are separated, and the HRN forms a trimeric coiled coil ( Figure 1 ). Folding of the HRC onto the HRN trimer leads to the formation of a six-helical bundle (6HB), and in this process, the two membranes are brought in close apposition, which leads to their fusion [11] (Figure 1 ). Peptides corresponding to the sequence of the HR regions can bind to the prehairpin intermediate, prevent its transition to the 6HB, and block fusion (Figure 2(A) ). This is the mechanism of inhibition of enfuvirtide [12] , which applies to several other peptides derived from the HR regions of many viruses [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

The resulting increase in local concentration at the site of action would translate into enhanced antiviral potency (Figure 2(B) ). Application of this concept to the HR-derived peptide C34 yielded C34-Chol, where the cholesterol group was attached, via a thioether bond, to the side chain of a Cys residue added to the C-terminus, with an intervening Gly-Ser-Gly spacer. Cholesterol conjugation brought a dramatic improvement of antiviral potency: Depending on the viral strain tested, C34-Chol was 25-to 100-fold more potent than unconjugated C34 and 50-to 400-fold more potent than enfuvirtide [78] . No such improvement was apparent when cholesterol was substituted with palmitic acid [78] , a lipid that is both a poorer membrane anchor and is not enriched in lipid rafts [79] . Numerous examples have since accumulated that cholesterol conjugation can improve the antiviral potency of HR-derived peptides from many enveloped virusesthese include in vitro and in vivo studies (Table 1) . Cholesterol conjugation has also been successfully applied to a covalent inhibitor derived from C34, where an isothiocyanate group on the side chain of Asp 632 targets Lys 574 in HRN [80] .",

For example, Porotto et al. showed that once-daily intraperitoneal administration of a cholesterol-conjugated inhibitor of Nipah virus to golden hamsters, an established model of infection, effectively prevented what would otherwise be fatal Nipah virus encephalitis. Prophylactic treatment was 100% efficacious when initiated 2 days before viral challenge and 80% efficacious when initiated concurrently with the infection. Notably, in light of the highly lethal nature of this virus, treatment 2 days after infection led to survival of 40% of the animals [86] .",

The project would begin immediately after the genome of the new pathogen is made available. The lead ID phase would consist in the bioinformatic analysis (e.g. via LearnCoil [30] or MultiCoil [31, 32] ) of the newly sequenced genome to identify the HR regions; it could last a few days. As discussed in the previous section, the computational identification of inhibitory peptides for viruses utilizing class II or III fusion proteins would be less straightforward, and the number of candidate peptides to be tested likely larger. However, given the high throughput of parallel solid-phase Figure 4 . Rapid response strategy based on cholesterol-conjugated fusion inhibitors. From the sequenced genome of the emerging virus, the HR regions are identified bioinformatically. This corresponds to the lead identification (lead ID) phase. In the lead optimization (lead opt) phase, candidate HR peptides are synthesized in the form of suitable precursors for cholesterol conjugation and reacted with the reagents shown in Figure 3 . The cholesterol-conjugated monomer and dimer are tested for antiviral activity. The lead opt cycle continues until a peptide is found potent enough to be moved to large-scale production. peptide synthesis and the modularity of the cholesterol conjugation reaction, the initial number of target sequences should not represent a key limiting factor in the lead optimization (lead opt) phase. In lead opt, candidate peptides would be synthesized in the form of suitable precursors for cholesterol conjugation and reacted with the reagents shown in Figure 3 or similar ones. The cholesterol-conjugated monomers and dimers would be tested for antiviral activity. In the logic of off-the-shelf reagents for immediate use, variations of the reagents of Figure 3 to optimize the length of the linker joining the monomers might provide considerable increase in potency [89] , as shown by Kay et al. [91] . Haloacetyl or maleimide-functionalized cores with polyethylene glycol spacers of different length could all be reacted with the same precursor to rapidly select the most potent inhibitor.",

Gp41 features two heptad repeat (HR) regions, which are separated in the prehairpin intermediate. The fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal to the HRN, anchors the protein into the target cell membrane. The protein is also anchored in the viral membrane by the transmembrane (TM) region, C-terminal to the HRC. Refolding of the intermediate leads to formation of a six-helix bundle (6HB), bringing the two membranes in close contact and driving fusion.",

Sheppard at LMB (Cambridge, UK), he held positions of increasing responsibility at ENIRICERCHE, SCLAVO (now part of GSK), and IRBM, the Italian site of Merck Research Laboratories, where he spent 20 years. Under his direction, the Peptide Centre of Excellence, the centralized Merck Unit for peptide medicinal chemistry, provided a number of preclinical candidates to the company pipeline. In 2009, he founded PeptiPharma, which offers consulting and contract research on therapeutic peptides. He is also the CSO of JV Bio, a start-up focused on clinical development of antiviral peptides and antibodies. He is the recipient of the 2005 Leonidas Zervas Award of the European Peptide Society and author of more than 160 publications and 40 patents. His current academic interest, in collaboration with CEINGE, a nonprofit consortium of the University of Naples, is the design of antibacterial peptides.
