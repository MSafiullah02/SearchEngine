[3] [4] [5] The details of clinical presentation at the time of testing was available only with New Delhi study. Of the 21 cases, 9 (42.9%) were asymptomatic, and 6 (28.6%) had comorbidities most commonly hypertension (23.8%) and diabetes mellitus (14.2%). 4 Of the symptomatic patients, fever and cough (42.9%), sore throat (23.8%), headache (13.6%) and breathlessness (4.8%) were the common clinical presentation. 4 A total of 134 (1.2%) and 521 (4.7%) patients were critically ill and deceased (case fatality rate-CFR) respectively in Maharashtra (n-11056) and none in New Delhi. 3, 4 Though higher CFR has been reported among males of Maharashtra (4.8%) compared to females (4.0%), no significant association was found between gender and mortality (p-0.05). The age-specific mortality rate was also high among patients aged 61-70 years (19.2%), 71-80 years (15.8%) and above 80 years (13.9%). 3 No details are available on clinical presentation and mortality other than SARI from sentinel site study.",

It was a cluster or community-based approach in Maharashtra and hospital-based approach in New Delhi and sentinel site study. Further, New Delhi study investigated all COVID-19 positive cases, and sentinel site study investigated all SARI cases for COVID-19.",

At times, actions are taken based on these predictions with many limitations, which may affect the country economically and politically in addition to individual-level adverse effects. Though the evidence generated so far in India is indeed too low to comment on the complete epidemiology, it is definitely not late to start, streamline and systematically collect the data and disseminate. In this crisis, the research community can be linked with the people delivering healthcare services at various levels for collecting quality-assured data.",
