If a raison d'\u00eatre exists for air transport then \u2014 in the simple mind of a marketing scientist \u2014 the reason likely relates to the airlines' customers. The problem was downsized to a workable version involving travelers ex Vienna on leisure or business trips to another European city. From the consumer behavior point of view the \u2018importance\u2019 of air transport may be interpreted in terms of preference or utility.

            "text": "Measuring the travelers perceived utility of a means of transport is nothing new. In transport studies, of course, the choice of a mode of transport represents one of the most popular problems. It may be analyzed on aggregate level by means of cross elasticities (Wardman, 1997) or by discrete choice micro-models (such as the multinomial logit). During the 1970s, MNL models were introduced by 2000 Nobel Laureate Daniel McFadden for investigating modal choice. Today, they are standard tools in transportation research and consulting practice (Wardman et al., 1992, Cambridge Systematics, Inc. and Mark, Bradley Research & Consulting, 2002). Later, choice models were embraced by marketing scientists and have become one of the major threads in advanced consumer behavior research. A comprehensive review of choice models in tourism is provided by Crouch and Louviere (2001); among the 38 pieces of research itemized, however, there is none dealing with alternative modes of transport in a trip package.",

In this study the mode of transport will be a prominent part of a trip package. Its utility as perceived by the travelers then may be compared to those of the other trip components simultaneously present in the package. A conjoint analysis approach is usually preferred for exploring the portions of utility contributed by individual product features. Again, this is not new methodology in tourism and hospitality research. Renaghan and Kay (1987) analyzed the part-worth utilities aroused by the services tied together in a convention product. One of the most popular sample applications of conjoint analysis for very complex mixtures of services also originates from hospitality research; it is the \u201cCourtyard by Marriott\u201d case outlined by Wind et al. (1989). Carmichael (1992) applied a standard version of conjoint analysis to analyze artificial attribute bundles representing ski resorts. Mazanec (2002) analyzed the effects of Euro versus old currency pricing of tour packages; he used a conjoint model with random coefficients to allow for traveler heterogeneity in the part-worth estimates.",

The literature offers two interpretations of the transport-tourism interface: the transport \u201cfor\u201d tourism or the transport \u201cas\u201d tourism philosophy. The former acknowledges only the utilitarian character of transport services while the latter admits \u201cintrinsic value as tourism experience\u201d (Lumsdon and Page, 2004). Regardless of which interpretation one chooses to follow, the role of the mode of transport in the travelers' evaluation of a trip package seems largely unexplored. There are, of course, innumerous travel and guest surveys from commercial sources including the mode of transport among their repertoire of trip attributes. However, these studies present their results in a usually narrative manner reporting about the frequencies of modes preferred without exploring the modes\u2019 contribution to the overall utility of the trip. One of the rare exceptions employing an up-to-date model of mode choice in a tourism setting is Nerhagen (2003)'s recent analysis of the influence of previous experience on choice behavior. This author proposes a binomial probit model with train and car as the alternatives and a linear utility function combining mode and traveler attributes. She also estimates the willingness-to-pay for a fictitious return trip dependent on former car or train usage.",

Given the questionable metric properties of the rating data only the preferential relationships among pairs of trip alternatives (preferred, not preferred, no preference) will be exploited.

The business travelers were shown four mode alternatives and only two levels for each of the other trip product elements. An orthogonal design with 9 artificial trip packages was chosen for leisure travelers. For the business travelers a compromise had to be drawn between perfect orthogonality and sufficiently realistic combinations. Levels correlated up to .71 (mode and length) and .44 (mode and hotel) were accepted to yield a nontrivial set of trip combinations. The respondents assessed each package on a ten-point rating scale expressing their degree of preference.

The EBTM offers several advantages over more popular versions of conjoint analysis (Dittrich et al., 1998). In particular, it allows for simultaneous estimation of the trip package (\u2018object\u2019) parameters, object covariates (trip attributes), subject covariates (traveler characteristics) and their interactions. In fact, the EBTM is a model for paired comparison data, i.e., the aim is to obtain estimated overall rankings of objects (with locations on an interval scale), where each subject (or judge) makes one or more comparisons between pairs of objects. This type of model can be applied to rating data as recorded in the current study by simply transforming the ratings of two trip packages, A and B say, into a paired comparison response which can be either \u2018A preferred\u2019, \u2018B preferred\u2019 or \u2018equal preference\u2019 depending on the rating value for the two packages.

            "text": "In terms of methodology the EBTM proved its ability of handling fairly complex systems of relationships involving rating data and many categorical variables. One tempting refinement of the methodology relates to the order information in the ratings. The transforming of the observed ratings into paired comparisons ignores the number of rating points stretching between a respondent\u2019s judgments of two alternatives. At least ordinal information may hide behind these differences and may remain unexploited after the downgrading of the level of measurement. Actually, the EBTM lends itself for further extensions that account for the rank differences in the preference data (cf. Dittrich et al., 2004). Tentatively, this was tried for the present data set and no remarkable effects on the parameter estimates were detected. But this is another story pointing to future research.",
