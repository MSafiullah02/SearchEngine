About 24.43% (32/131) of the patients died of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure (MOF).

It was the first reported case of a human infected with a low-pathogenicity H7N9 virus that had a fatal outcome.",

He consulted an outpatient clinic in Hangzhou on March 9 and he was admitted to the Second Hospital of Jiande in Hangzhou on March 18, 2013 for the first time. On admission, he had fever (39.5\u00b0C), cough, and expectoration of bloody sputum, and his chest radiograph showed shadows in the right lower lobes. Blood tests showed a white cell count of 2.33 \u00c2 10 9 /L and his C-reactive protein (CRP) was 43.7 mg/L. On March 20, 2013 he was transferred to the First People's Hospital in Xiaoshan in Hangzhou to hospitalization for the second time, because the cefodizime + levofloxacin treatment was ineffective. His second chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral consolidation with right pleural effusion. He was diagnosed with \"acute pneumonia.\" His condition continued to deteriorate and he developed multiple organ failure (MOF) on March 24 despite oxygen therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone + tazobactam), and corticosteroid (Urbason) treatment. Consequently, he was intubated and ventilated on the same day. On March 27, he died of ARDS, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and MOF. The swab samples collected on March 24, 2013 and the RNA tested positive for influenza A but excluding seasonal influenza A/H1, H3, H5N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1 and influenza B, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-Erasmus Medical Center under rRT-PCR assays. He was confirmed as an avian influenza A (H7N9) virus case by analyzing eight segments, performed in China CDC on April 1, 2013. The delay in seeking medical care resulted in the patient presenting with severe acute lower respiratory symptoms with several complications upon hospital admission. Thus, he was diagnosed with avian influenza A (H7N9) 5 days after he died and he did not receive antiviral treatment during the clinical course of the disease.",

The main high-risk population is similar to that of H5N1, which consists of individuals with frequent contact with poultry, those with suppressed immune function, and the elderly with underlying diseases. The initial epidemiology suggests that the confirmed H7N9 cases were isolated, without sustained transmission among people, although two family clusters have been reported, which differs from the limited person-to-person transmission in H5N1 [16] . The source of infection and the mode of transmission are currently unknown. Although some of the confirmed cases were exposed to birds and animals or to outdoor environments, the cases are not associated with disease outbreaks among animals or with direct exposure to animals. About 65% of the confirmed cases had histories of avian exposure, which indicates that contact with live poultry and excreta is a high-risk factor, similar to the H5N1 virus infection in China [17, 18] . The confirmed H7N9 cases developed critical and fatal illness, which indicates that the H7N9 virus is more virulent in humans than other H7 viruses and the 2009 H1N1 virus [19] . The current H7N9 case fatality rate is similar to that for reported H5N1 viral infections [20] .",
