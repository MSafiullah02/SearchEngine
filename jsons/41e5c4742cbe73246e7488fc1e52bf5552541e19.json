The ability of the corresponding mRNA, generated by in vitro transcription, to be translated in an Escherichia coli cell-free extract is the first demonstration that the HIV-1 frameshift can be reproduced in a bacterial cell-free extract, providing a powerful approach for analysis of the frameshift mechanism. The responses of the frameshift signal to chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of peptide bond formation, and spectinomycin, an inhibitor of translocation, suggest that the frameshift complies with the same rules found in eukaryotic translation systems. Furthermore, when translation was performed in the presence of streptomycin and neamine, two errorinducing antibiotics, or with hyperaccurate ribosomes mutated in S12, the frameshift efficiency was increased or decreased, respectively, but only in the presence of the stem-loop, suggesting that the stem-loop can influence the frameshift through a functional interaction with the ribosomes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "A variety of viruses use a programmed -1 frameshift to synthesize their replicases. A well-known paradigm is human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), which uses a programmed -1 frameshift during translation of its mRNA to achieve synthesis of the Gag-Pol polyprotein, the precursor of the viral protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Standard translation of the same retroviral mRNA produces Gag, the precursor of structural proteins. The ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol proteins is critical for viral assembly and replication (6, 7) , which makes the ribosomal frameshift a potential anti-retroviral target (8) . Several studies aimed at characterizing the ribosomal frameshifting signals in HIV-1 have been performed either in cultured eukaryotic cells or in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system. In these studies, mRNAs encoded Gag and Gag-Pol, or, alternatively, the frameshift region of HIV-1 was inserted at the beginning of the coding region of a reporter gene, so that its expression was dependent upon the frameshift (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . It was found that the frameshift of HIV-1 occurs at a slippery heptamer, U UUU UUA, where the unshifted frame is indicated, followed at a distance of 7 nt by a potential stemloop structure, whose existence was recently supported by enzymatic probing (16) . This stem-loop does not appear to influence the frameshift in most in vitro studies, whereas it was found to stimulate the frameshift when the assays were performed in cultured cells. The HIV-1 frameshift was reproduced in yeast by Wilson et al. (17) , who found that the stemloop structure was dispensable, a conclusion challenged by Stahl et al. (15) , who demonstrated a stimulatory effect of the stem-loop.

A similar observation has been made with eukaryotic ribosomes, where the frameshift efficiency for the HIV-1 slippery sequence was much more dependent on the presence of the stem-loop in cultured cells than in vitro (10,11,14 and references therein). In vivo ribosomes move along the mRNA at a high rate and we suggest that when they contact a stem-loop downstream of a slippery sequence, as is the case in the HIV-1 frameshift region, they are slowed down during the period of time required for their associated helicase activity to melt the stem-loop. Indeed, the stimulatory effect on frameshifting of a stem-loop following the HIV-1 slippery sequence was directly related to the stability of this stem-loop, when assayed in yeast and in cultured mammalian cells (37) . However, in vitro ribosomes move at a slower rate and our results suggest that the necessity of melting the stem-loop does not appear to further slow down the ribosomes. This would account for the lack of effect or the weak effect of the stemloop on frameshift efficiency, as shown by our results and in agreement with the literature (10, 11, 14) . However, this does not apply to pseudoknot structures at the sites of ribosomal frameshift, which are very stable (38) and likely more difficult to unwind. Assays in a eukaryotic in vitro translation system demonstrated that a slippery sequence followed by a pseudoknot causes the ribosomes to pause, which increases the probability of a frameshift (39, 40) . Interestingly, when the HIV-1 slippery sequence was inserted into a reporter mRNA followed by a pseudoknot structure from mouse mammary tumor virus or from a coronavirus, the in vitro frameshift efficiency increased~3-to 5-fold compared to the construct containing the stem-loop, demonstrating a substantial stimulatory effect of the pseudoknots (41,42).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 382, "end": 395, "text": "(10,11,14 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 932, "end": 936, "text": "(37)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1277, "text": "(10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "11,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1285, "text": "14)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1406, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1641, "text": "(39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1645, "text": "40)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "In vivo"}, {"text": "The availability of the bacterial in vitro frameshift assay allowed us to take advantage of various well-characterized inhibitors of the bacterial translational machinery. Two drugs were first investigated for their effect on HIV-1 ribosomal frameshifting in an E.coli cell-free translation system: chloramphenicol (which interferes with peptide bond formation), and spectinomycin (which blocks translocation). Spectinomycin did not affect the ribosomal frameshift, whether the stem-loop was present or absent. This does not support a previous suggestion by Weiss et al. (18) that the HIV-1 programmed frameshift could occur after peptide bond formation. Indeed, if this had been the case, an inhibitor of translocation would have increased frameshift efficiency, by leaving more time for the ribosomes to shift. In agreement with our observations, Tumer et al. (43) observed that an inhibitor of translocation did not affect the programmed -1 frameshift in the yeast L-A double-stranded RNA virus. In contrast to spectinomycin, chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of peptide bond formation, was found to slightly but reproducibly increase frameshift efficiency, whether the stem-loop was present or not. The classic two-tRNA slippage model (2, 21) proposes that the ribosomal frameshift occurs prior to peptide bond synthesis with the ribosome bearing the aminoacyl-tRNA and the peptidyl-tRNA in the A and P sites, respectively. An inhibitor of peptide bond synthesis such as chloramphenicol should therefore increase frameshift efficiency, as shown by our results. The same observation was made by Dinman et al. (44) , when investigating the effect of sparsomycin, a peptidyl transferase inhibitor, that increased the programmed -1 frameshift in the yeast L-A double-stranded RNA virus. One could argue here that Dinman et al. (44) showed that, in contrast to sparsomycin, anisomycin, another peptidyl transferase inhibitor, decreased the programmed -1 frameshift. However, as discussed by these authors, this decreased frameshift likely results from the fact that translation preferentially aborts on frameshifted ribosomes in the presence of anisomycin.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 558, "end": 575, "text": "Weiss et al.

However, a drawback of this model is that peptide bond formation takes place as soon as the aminoacyl-tRNA reaches the A site, which does not leave much time for the frameshift to occur. The incoming aminoacyl-tRNA is delivered to the ribosome as a ternary complex (aminoacyl-tRNA\u00b7GTP\u00b7EF-Tu), which first interacts with an entry site (A/ T), from where it moves to the A site after GTP hydrolysis and release of EF-Tu\u00b7GDP (reviewed in 45,46; Fig. 3A ). This step is rate limiting in protein synthesis (46) . To solve the problem raised by the transient character of the state where the two-tRNA slippage was proposed to occur, we suggest that it could occur before occupancy of the A site (Fig. 3B) , with the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site and the aminoacyl-tRNA complexed to EF-Tu in the A/T site, either before or after GTP hydrolysis. This suggestion, which was also envisaged by Farabaugh (4) , is supported by the characterization of mutants in the yeast counterpart of EF-Tu that increase programmed -1 frameshifting in the yeast L-A double-stranded RNA virus, probably because of interference with GTP hydrolysis (47) . However, our results do not exclude the possibility that, for some of the ribosomes that shift the reading frame, the aminoacyl-tRNA occupies the A site, as proposed by the classic two-tRNA slippage model. Moreover, one-tRNA slippage, with ribosomes bearing the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site but having an empty A site (19,20; reassessed in 3), could also contribute to the frameshift.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 169, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 170, "end": 173, "text": "21)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 698, "end": 702, "text": "(46)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1091, "text": "Farabaugh (4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1319, "text": "(47)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1646, "text": "(19,20;", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 639, "end": 646, "text": "Fig. 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 886, "end": 895, "text": "(Fig. 3B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "A refinement of the classic two-tRNA simultaneous slippage model"}, {"text": "As discussed above, the frameshift efficiency of wild-type ribosomes traversing the HIV-1 Gag-Pol region is not affected by absence of the stem-loop in a cell-free system. Interestingly, when we performed the in vitro translation assays with hyperaccurate ribosomes harboring an altered 30S protein S12, the frameshift efficiency was decreased, but only in the presence of the stem-loop structure. In the same line, in the presence of the error-inducing drugs streptomycin and neamine, the frameshift efficiency was increased, but again only in the presence of the stem-loop. Our interpretation of these results, in the light of the refined model of two-tRNA slippage, is that several parameters modulate the frameshift efficiency with mutant ribosomes or in the presence of the error-inducing drugs. With hyperaccurate ribosomes, occupancy of the A site is slowed down (48) . According to the refined model for frameshifting, we predict that this should increase the frameshift efficiency by providing more time for the ribosomes to shift before A site occupancy and instantaneous formation of the peptide bond. On the other hand, hyperaccurate ribosomes weaken the codon-anticodon interaction at the A site and consequently at the A/T site (49) , which contributes to their increased capacity to correct translation errors. Since codonanticodon interaction for the aminoacyl-tRNA in the post-slippage state relies on the interaction of two bases rather than three as in the pre-slippage state, we predict that this weakening of codon-anticodon interaction likely disfavors the postslippage state. The converse situation is encountered with ribosomes in the presence of streptomycin or neamine, which strengthen the codon-anticodon interaction in the A site (49) . This strengthening, by stabilizing binding of the tRNA in the post-slippage state, could favor the shift. However, occupancy of the A site is accelerated by streptomycin or neamine (48) , which should disfavor the shift by leaving less time for the ribosomes to shift before peptide bond formation. We propose that these antagonistic effects account for the lack of influence of S12 mutations or error-stimulating antibiotics on frameshift efficiency in the absence of the stem-loop structure. However, in the presence of the stem-loop, frameshift efficiency is decreased by S12 mutations whereas it is increased in the presence of the error-inducing drugs. The binding of streptomycin or neamine or the presence of mutations in S12 are known to induce conformational changes in the ribosomes (50,51 and references therein). One attractive hypothesis is that when ribosomes mutated in S12 encounter the stem-loop, they undergo a transition to a conformation which is less prone to slip. Conversely, ribosomes bound to streptomycin or neamine would undergo a transition to a conformation which is more prone to slip. This hypothesis therefore suggests that there is a functional interaction between the ribosome and the stem-loop structure, and not merely a physical contact. In line with this suggestion, Tinoco and co-workers (52, 53) , who studied the conformation of pseudoknots that influence frameshifting by NMR, found that a specific bent conformation is required for these pseudoknots to stimulate the frameshift, which implies that they do not just act as a barrier to movement of the ribosome but could specifically interact with the ribosome. However, in vivo the frameshift efficiency was unaffected when ribosomes were hyperaccurate. As discussed above, ribosomes move along the mRNA at a higher rate in vivo than in vitro. This enables the downstream stem-loop to stimulate the frameshift, but more subtle effects detected when ribosomes move at a slower pace, such as those resulting from ribosomal mutations, can be masked. Altogether, our results indicate that the cell-free translation system appears more appropriate to identify the ribosomal components involved in the interaction with the stem-loop.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 870, "end": 874, "text": "(48)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1246, "text": "(49)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1763, "text": "(49)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1951, "text": "(48)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3093, "end": 3097, "text": "(52,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3098, "end": 3101, "text": "53)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The stem-loop structure downstream from the heptanucleotide slippery sequence of HIV-1 influences the frameshift by interacting with the ribosome"}, {"text": "The E.coli cell-free translation system constitutes a powerful system to gain further insights into the mechanisms that control the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift of the Gag-Pol region of HIV-1.
