Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a respiratory disease of varying severity [4], which presents more commonly as asymptomatic or mild disease in newborns when compared with adults [5\u20137]. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets, infected fomites [8\u201310], and from airborne transmission during aerosolization procedures [11]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published initial guidance on the management of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 [12]. Another group recently published a practical resource for perinatal-neonatal specialists, providing the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 during pregnancy [13]. Since the epidemiological data for this pandemic are rapidly evolving, neonatologists need to continuously update management strategies for neonates born to mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 [13, 14].",

Early Chinese reports suggested that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 does not occur, as amniotic fluid, vaginal mucus, placenta, umbilical cord, cord blood, and neonatal stool specimens tested negative for the virus [20\u201327]. In addition, nasopharyngeal swabs from these newborns immediately after delivery were negative. Moreover, there were no reports of vertical transmission during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks due to genetically similar coronaviruses [3, 28, 29].",

The authors argued that since strict infection prevention procedures were used during the deliveries, the early-onset infections resulted from vertical transmission. It is unclear, however, if strict isolation and infection control measures continued beyond the deliveries. The earliest reported neonatal positive test occurred in a 16 h old neonate born to a mechanically ventilated mother with COVID-19 after cesarean delivery with immediate isolation, at 33 weeks\u2019 gestation [30]. While the early positive test was concerning for a vertical infection, amniotic fluid, cord blood, and placenta were not tested for virus, and therefore secondary transmission could not be excluded [30].",

The physiological mechanisms underlying these differences are as yet unknown, but several possibilities exist that should be explored in future studies. The immature developing immune system of children may respond to SARS-CoV-2 differently than adults, possibly resulting in a less damaging cytokine reaction. SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme-II (ACE-2) receptors on type II alveolar epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract to gain entry into the lungs [35, 36], and ACE-2 receptors may be functionally immature in children making them less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [37].",

Mothers should wash their hands before and after pumping, and the breast pump should be properly disinfected per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If possible, expressed breast milk should be fed to newborns by a healthy caregiver. If a mother with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 chooses to directly breastfeed, she should wear a surgical mask and perform hand and breast hygiene prior to feeding. When the mother is not breastfeeding, the newborn should remain >2 m (~6 ft) away, be separated by a barrier, and/or be placed in an isolette. The World Health Organization and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund recommend standard breastfeeding guidelines within an hour of birth using appropriate infection prevention precautions [55, 56]. This advice may be most pertinent to areas where limited resources make breastfeeding the only viable option.",

Therefore, common aerosolizing procedures in the NICU, such as intubation, extubation, open suctioning, noninvasive ventilation, and placement of naso- and oro-gastric tubes need to be conducted with a high degree of caution, using appropriate PPE in negative-pressure rooms [11, 44]. Institutional variation of what is considered an aerosol generating procedure and how that will affect professionals caring for COVID-19 patients adds another layer of complexity [68, 69]. A single center study showed that the team members who directly performed these procedures were at highest risk of becoming infected [70].

Masks covering both the nose and mouth, as well as using the lowest possible pressure, may minimize some of the risk.

RT-PCR is currently recommended for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in respiratory tract specimens [80]. The Emergency Use Authorization FDA approved test used at Penn State is the Simplexa\u00ae COVID-19 Direct Kit (DiaSorin Molecular, Cypress, CA). It has excellent specificity. For newborns, the AAP recommends obtaining throat and nasopharynx swabs at about 24 and 48 h after birth, although the optimal time of testing is unknown [12]. The testing regimen should also take into account the risk of infection and limitations of resources. Additional testing in symptomatic neonates should be considered because early test results may be negative due to the incubation period of the virus. A respiratory viral panel, to rule out other infections, should also be considered in symptomatic neonates [15].",

Neonates are weighed on the home scale during the encounter, allowing the pediatrician to visualize the neonate\u2019s tone, color, demeanor, and respiratory status. If the pediatrician is concerned about jaundice, or if the infant was discharged with home phototherapy, arrangements are made for a laboratory technician in full PPE to obtain a serum bilirubin sample in the home.

Although vertical transmission is unlikely, monitoring of neonates born to mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is imperative. While many facets of care remain the same, other practices such as antenatal corticosteroids, DCC, separation and visitation, breastfeeding, airway management and respiratory support, and neonatal follow-up have been impacted by COVID-19. While we hope our policies and procedures may be helpful to other institutions, each center must develop and revise their guidelines to provide optimal care for patients while conserving vital PPE and ventilators and protecting healthcare workers. Given the low rate of disease in newborns to date, our policies may change in the near future to allow cohabitation, direct breastfeeding, and routine newborn care for newborn PUIs without signs of disease.",
