There are three major strains of seasonal influenza: A, B and C, but influenza A and B cause the majority of disease. Influenza A is classified into subtypes according to the combination of haemagglutinin or \u2018H\u2019 protein and the neuraminidase or \u2018N\u2019 protein on the surface of the virus [3]. New viruses are created through antigenic shift or drift. A pandemic occurs when a new virus emerges and circulates in a population where there is minimal immunity; this can occur outside the normal influenza season [3].",

            "text": "\nNAIs are effective for the treatment of influenza in ambulatory patients with mild illness, when treatment is commenced within 48 h [10\u201312]. In previously healthy patients, NAIs reduce symptom duration and severity, viral shedding, and time taken to return to normal activities [16]. In a meta-analysis, oseltamivir has been shown to reduce lower respiratory complications that lead to antibiotic use by 28 % compared with placebo [17]. Treatment within 12 h of symptom onset has been shown to reduce the incidence of otitis media, and treatment within 24 h of symptoms decreased duration of illness by 3.5 days [18]. However, the efficacy of NAIs for the prevention of complications in some high-risk groups is less clear [19].In 2012, Jefferson and colleagues published a Cochrane review of NAIs for the treatment and prevention of influenza in healthy adults and children, but the review was hampered by difficulties in obtaining clinical study reports [20]. They analysed data from 25 of 67 randomised controlled trials reviewed, but noted a high risk of reporting and publication biases. The investigators concluded that oseltamivir had a modest benefit in previously healthy patients, reducing duration of symptoms by 21 h, but had no effect on hospitalisation [20].In 2013, Michiels and colleagues published a systematic review of systematic reviews to address the value of NAIs for the prevention and treatment of seasonal influenza focusing on data from randomised clinical trials [8]. NAIs can reduce the time to alleviation of symptoms in previously healthy adults and children but the effect in the elderly and at-risk individuals is unclear (Fig. 1a). The use of NAIs was associated with a non-significant reduction in the odds of pneumonia in most study populations (Fig. 1b), but the meta-analysis did not find any consistent reductions in the odds of hospitalisation (Fig. 1c). Therefore, while the review documented clear benefits in less definitive outcomes such as time-to-alleviation of symptoms in previously healthy children and adults [8], it was unable to give conclusive evidence on the efficacy of NAIs in patients at the highest risk of influenza-related complications, and highlighted the lack of evidence for the efficacy of NAIs in more definitive outcomes such as pneumonia and hospitalisation.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of 74 observational studies in 2012 by Hsu and colleagues attempted to address the benefits and potential harm of antivirals for the treatment of influenza [21]. The meta-analysis suggested that in high-risk patients NAIs may reduce mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.23], hospitalisation (OR 0.75) and duration of symptoms when compared with no therapy. These findings must be interpreted with caution as the quality of evidence is low, limited by multiple confounders in the original studies and publication and reporting biases [21].A recently published meta-analysis of individual participant data comprised of 29,234 hospitalised patients worldwide with pandemic influenza A H1N1(09) demonstrated that treatment of adult patients with NAIs reduced mortality risk compared with no treatment. The effect is more pronounced if treated early. A greater benefit was observed with early NAI treatment. However, no mortality benefit could be established in children treated with NAIs. The study was unable to adjust for disease severity but the results suggest that NAIs should be initiated early in patients with influenza who require hospitalisation [22\u2022\u2022].In summary, there was a lack of conclusive evidence on the efficacy of NAIs for the prevention of influenza-related complications in at-risk populations based on reviews of data from randomised trials. However, observational studies suggest that, in hospitalised patients, early treatment with NAIs has been associated with reduced mortality. The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control (US) recommend that NAIs should be used for the treatment of influenza in patients at risk of influenza-related complications, hospitalised patients and patients with severe or complicated illness [2\u2022, 23\u2022\u2022]. NAI therapy can be considered in previously healthy people when it can be initiated within 48 h of symptom onset, but needs to be weighed against the risk of drug-related adverse effects and the potential for NAI resistance.\n",

Renal dose adjustment is not required in patients receiving inhalational therapy [30].Administration of zanamivir in a lactose powder solution via endotracheal nebulisation (of the commercial powder containing lactose) has been reported in intubated patients with severe influenza. This route of administration has resulted in ventilator malfunction, which likely contributed to mortality [31, 32]. The commercial lactose powder formulation of zanamivir should only be used for oral inhalation [33].IV zanamivir is in clinical development and has shown promising results in a phase II study [34]; renal dose adjustment is required [34, 35].

Oseltamivir has been shown to reduce influenza-related complications. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the efficacy of NAIs in children \u2018at risk\u2019 of influenza-related complications. Oseltamivir did not reduce symptom duration in children with asthma [41]. Retrospective data suggests that early initiation of NAIs may reduce mortality in children [42] but further studies are needed to understand the role of NAIs for the treatment of children at risk of influenza-related complications.Weight-based dosing of oseltamivir is recommended in children aged 1\u201312 years of age [13].Oseltamivir pharmacokinetics differ in the very young. Oseltamivir should be dosed at 3.5 mg/kg orally twice daily in children aged between 9 and 11 months, and 3 mg/kg orally twice daily in infants less than 8 months of age [43].NAI resistance may be an issue in the paediatric population, with higher rates of post-treatment oseltamivir resistance observed in paediatric patients, but this may be the result of under-dosing in young children, and requires further evaluation [25, 44].High rates of neuropsychiatric side effects have been observed in children treated with oseltamivir (up to 36 %) and may be the result of ABCB1 polymorphism which increases brain permeability of the drug [45]. Caution should be exercised when prescribing oseltamivir to adolescents due to reports of significant neuropsychiatric events in this age group; symptomatic management should be used in those who are not at high risk of influenza-related complications [46].\n",

Early initiation of therapy (within 48 h of symptom onset) has been shown to decrease symptom duration and severity and time taken to return to normal activities [16]. International guidelines advocate early treatment (ideally within 48 h of symptom onset) in at-risk individuals [2\u2022, 23\u2022\u2022]. Early initiation of NAIs has been associated with improved survival in observational studies [57, 58].While it is accepted that early treatment provides maximal benefit, the efficacy of delayed treatment remains unclear. Observational data suggests that treatment with NAIs beyond 48 h is clinically beneficial in patients with severe [59] or complicated disease [60] and in pregnant women [61]. A recent randomised controlled trial demonstrated that oseltamivir reduced viral shedding and symptom duration in uncomplicated influenza, even when initiation was delayed beyond 48 h [62]. Survival benefit has been observed in patients with influenza A (H5N1) infections who received oseltamivir up to 8 days after symptom onset, but maximal benefit was observed with early initiation of therapy [63]. At this stage there is insufficient data to recommend treatment beyond 48 h in patients at low-risk of influenza-related complications. In patients at high-risk of influenza-related complications, initiation of therapy beyond 48 h should be considered. Further studies are needed to delineate the optimal timing of NAIs.\n",

Significant rates of oseltamivir-resistance have not been found in other subtypes of seasonal influenza [65].In a systematic review, the overall incidence of oseltamivir resistance was 2.7 % [66], but varied by subtype, with higher rates observed in influenza A, especially the H1N1 and H3N2 subgroups [66]. Infection with oseltamivir-resistant virus was associated with influenza-related pneumonia [66]Resistance to the NAIs is a result of neuraminidase mutations. The neuraminidase mutations that confer resistance vary with influenza subtype and NAI [67].The H275Y mutation, in the N1 subtype, is the most common mutation and confers resistance to oseltamivir [67]. This mutation is associated with cross-resistance to peramivir but not to zanamivir [67].The E119V mutation, in the N2 subtype, confers resistance to oseltamivir but zanamivir usually remains active [67].The R292K mutation, also in the N2 subtype, confers resistance to oseltamivir with cross-resistance to zanamivir [67].Inhaled or IV zanamivir is currently the treatment of choice for oseltamivir-resistant virus, as resistance is most commonly secondary to the H275Y mutation, to which zanamivir remains active [67].\n",
