            "text": "E-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (EVALI) has become a recent alarming public health concern [1\u20138]. Factors that contribute to the concern include an increasing number of cases over time, the severity of the illness, and an unknown understanding of the pathophysiology and etiology of the illness. Although a single etiology and the mechanism of toxicity are not known, patients tend to have a similar clinical course, starting with initial malaise and vague gastrointestinal symptoms, with a subsequent development of cough, dyspnea, and fevers. The patients can develop radiographic findings of bilateral pulmonary opacities [9], and they can progress to respiratory failure in severe cases. Herein, we report three recent cases of EVALI, all of whom initially reported to an outpatient clinic and were diagnosed with pneumonia, before progressive deterioration required admission to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). None of the three patients had prior lung pathology. They were treated with high-dose steroids, had pulmonary function testing at the day of discharge, and quantitative analysis was completed on one of the products. All three patients and their parents provided verbal and written consent for this report; this case series was deemed exempt by our Institutional Review Board.",

We will defer discussion of aflatoxin and cannabinoids as these are not known to cause acute tissue damage and their effects are well described. Furthermore, we will defer the complex discussion on vitamin E acetate because it was discussed in other publications and is under investigation by the United States Food and Drug Administration [8, 10]. The following pesticides were not detected at the level of quantification (LOQ) of 0.065 ppm via LC-MS/MS: acetamiprid, aldicarb, azoxystrobin, carbaryl, carbofuran, chlorantraniliprole, fipronil, flonicamid, imidacloprid, metalaxyl, methiocarb, methomyl, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam.

When heated to over 150 \u00b0C, tebuconazole decomposes to hydrogen chloride and multiple nitrogen oxide products (including nitrogen dioxide) [15\u201318]. Hydrogen chloride in this setting can produce chlorine gas which should not have delayed pulmonary effects but may explain a fleeting \u201cburning\u201d sensation our patient described; though, the product fluid was found to have a lower concentration than is considered a harmful hydrogen chloride concentration in the occupational setting. Nitrogen dioxide is a classic pulmonary toxicant known to produce delayed pulmonary effects including non-cardiac pulmonary edema and ARDS. In acute exposure, it is known to cause fever, anorexia, and lipid peroxidation seen on bronchoalveolar lavage [17]. This can contribute to lipoid pneumonia which has been reported by others [1]. Another nitrogen oxide is nitric oxide which plays an important role in gastrointestinal motility and dysmotility [19]. We propose that pyrolysis and inhalation of tebuconazole might have contributed to the initial burning sensation from chlorine gas, early gastrointestinal symptoms from nitric oxide, and delayed ARDS from nitrogen dioxide. The contribution of tebuconazole to EVALI remains to be determined through further work.",

It is unclear if these patients were asked about risk behaviors, specifically vaping, during those encounters. It is also unknown if these patients were evaluated in the presence of their caregivers or alone. Given the popularity among adolescents and adults for these products, along with the increasing incidence of EVALI, we feel it is imperative for all providers to consider vaping as part of the differential diagnosis for any patient who presents with malaise, cough, and dyspnea, particularly if gastrointestinal symptomatology and hypoxemia is also associated with acute illness.",
