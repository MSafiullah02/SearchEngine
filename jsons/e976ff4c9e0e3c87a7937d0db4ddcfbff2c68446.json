Complete intervention included keeping social distance, washing hands, strict travel restriction, no large group gatherings, mandatory quarantine, restricted public transportation, keep social distance, school closing and closure of all non-essential business, including manufacturing. Using real data to evaluate the consequences of specific intervention is infeasible. We considered four intervention scenarios.

Delaying intervention will substantially increase the number of cumulative cases of Covid-19. eFigure 4 shows the case-fatality rate curve as a function of the Date where the case-fatality rate was defined as the ratio of the number of deaths over the number of cumulative cases in the world.
