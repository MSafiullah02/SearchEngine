Samples from these lynxes were regularly tested to determine the presence of feline pathogens (Meli et al., 2009). In early December 2006, an adult male from the Coto del Rey subpopulation of the Do\u00f1ana National Park was found to be FeLV provirus- and p27-positive. The same animal had been negative in the previous examination in December 2005. However, at time of immobilization in December 2006 this animal showed no signs of disease and was released. In Coto del Rey, another two adult males, three adult females, two young males and two young females were captured in December 2006 and were FeLV-negative. Coto del Rey is a small patch of Mediterranean scrubland habitat with a high lynx density and stable lynx reproduction (Palomares et al., 2001, Palomares et al., 2005). Contemporaneously, another five lynxes (two adult females, one adult male, one young female and one young male) were captured for evaluation in December 2006 in another subpopulation of the center of the Do\u00f1ana National Park called Reserva Biologica de Do\u00f1ana (RBD) and were also FeLV-negative. In addition, another adult male, an adult female and a young female, all FeLV-negative, had been captured in December 2006 in another area outside the national park called Dehesa de Gato, situated to 12\u201315 km to the northeastern from Coto del Rey. Subsequently, between March 13th and May 17th, 2007 all three of the adult males of the Coto del Rey subpopulation were found dead. Another one from Dehesa de Gato was found to be extremely weak with poor body condition, and was euthanized. Necropsies of these lynxes indicated that they apparently died of opportunistic bacterial infections; all of them tested FeLV provirus- and p27-positive.",

Fourteen lynxes, 13 from the Do\u00f1ana area (12 animals from the epidemic in 2007 and one animal \u201cArena\u201d found dead from a road kill accident in 2004) and one from Sierra Morena, tested positive for FeLV-A provirus (Table 1\n), but negative for FeLV-B and FeLV-C (data not shown). FeLV provirus was amplified and sequenced from 11 positive lynxes from the Do\u00f1ana area. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the surface unit (SU) of the env gene revealed a common origin for the provirus found in Do\u00f1ana lynxes in 2007 (99.5\u2013100% identity). The sequences clustered with, and were 97.9\u201398.2% identical to, the FeLV-A/61E strain (Fig. 2A) (Pedersen et al., 1987, Overbaugh et al., 1988), while the sequence obtained from the lynx found to be provirus-positive in 2004 was only 94.8\u201395% identical to the other sequences and was more related to FeLV-A/Rickard (97.4% identity, Fig. 2A). The predicted amino acid sequences of the SU glycoprotein from animals infected in 2007 presented an identity/similarity of 97.3\u201397.6%/98.6\u201398.9% to FeLV-A/61E and of 95.9\u201396.2%/97.6\u201397.8% to FeLV-A/Rickard, respectively, while the identity/similarity of the sequence from the animal infected in 2004 was 97.3%/98.6% to FeLV-A/61E, 96.2%/97.8% to FeLV-A/Rickard, and 96.7\u201397.0%/98.9\u201399.2% to the 2007 sequences, respectively. At the protein level, all sequences from the Iberian lynxes clustered together with FeLV-A/61E and FeLV-A/Rickard (Fig. 2B). No sequences were found that showed a close relationship to FeLV-A/61C, associated with FeLV-A/61E in cats with severe immunosuppression.",

Contact with and killing of other carnivore species, such as domestic cats (Felis catus), has been well documented in the Iberian lynx (Palomares and Caro, 1999). Screening for endogenous FeLV (enFeLV)-related sequences in these Iberian lynxes was essentially negative: only five of the 77 lynxes tested by quantitative real-time PCR displayed weak signals (less than one copy per 10,000 cells), yet incompatible with the presence of enFeLV sequences, which have to be present in at least one copy per cell. These results can only be explained by the presence of either endogenous sequences related to enFeLV of domestic cats, or of a co-infection with another gammaretrovirus, both showing a weak cross-reactivity to the real-time PCR systems used. The absence of FeLV-B in infected Iberian lynxes is not surprising: FeLV-B is the result of a recombination between exogenous and enFeLV, and a relatively frequent mechanism leading to increased pathogenicity of FeLV, with an incidence usually higher than 50% in diseased domestic cats (Coelho et al., 2008). However, it has still to be elucidated whether recombination with as yet to be identified endogenous gammaretroviruses closely related to FeLV might have induced disease in Iberian lynxes through a mechanism analogous to FeLV-B in infected domestic cats (Meli et al., 2009).",

These viral infections are known to affect wild felids (Brown et al., 1994, Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1996, Roelke-Parker et al., 1996). In addition, animals were tested for C. felis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, hemotropic mycoplasmas, B. henselae, and Chlampydophila felis. In the Do\u00f1ana area antibody titers to FHV and CDV were found more frequent than in the Sierra Morena area. In contrast, antibody titers to FCoV and to FCV were found more frequent in the Sierra Morena area. CDV- and FPV-antigen positive animals were found only in the Do\u00f1ana area, while all C. felis-positive lynxes originated from Sierra Morena. Hemotropic mycoplasmas were highly prevalent in both populations. No evidence of active infections with FIV, FCoV, FHV, FCV, or A. phagocytophilum was found (Table 1).

            "text": "The high pathogenicity observed in FeLV-infected Iberian lynxes might be due to host, rather than to viral factors. The genetic diversity of the Do\u00f1ana lynx population is lower than that of the Sierra Morena population (Johnson et al., 2004); FeLV could have a higher pathogenic potential in inbred animals. Cheetahs, another wild felid species with reduced genetic diversity, also demonstrate increased susceptibility to infectious disease agents (Heeney et al., 1990). Recently, an immune-mediated systemic disease of unknown origin has been postulated in the Iberian lynx (Pe\u00f1a et al., 2006). Furthermore, the presence of co-infections could also have contributed to the high pathogenicity of FeLV in the lynxes. A significant association between FeLV infection and haemotropic mycoplasma infections, i.e., M. haemofelis and \u2018Candidatus M. turicensis\u2019, was found. Hemotropic mycoplasma infections have been found in the Iberian lynx population prior to the detection of FeLV infection. Thus, it is possible that pre-existing hemoplasma infections may have influenced FeLV infection outcome. The increased frequency of FeLV infection in lynxes positive for hemotropic mycoplasmas could also reflect simultaneous transmission of these agents with FeLV during cat-to-lynx contact.",

            "text": "In a recently published retrospective study (Luaces et al., 2008), six of 21 lynxes sampled between 1993 and 2003 were found to be FeLV provirus-positive in Do\u00f1ana and Sierra Morena areas, but not antigenemic. Although no clinical data were reported in this study, there was no indication that FeLV infection could represent a major risk for the lynx populations. From late 2003 to late 2006, FeLV infection (provirus) was detected in one animal. It is likely that FeLV infection in lynxes is rare, not endemic within lynx populations, and most likely originating from feral cats, which are not infrequent in the Do\u00f1ana area (Palomares and Delibes, 1993). The FeLV antigen prevalence was reported to be \u223c16% in Spanish cats (Arjona et al., 2000); it might be even higher around Do\u00f1ana (G. Lopez, unpublished data). Furthermore, lynxes frequently kill other smaller carnivores including cats (Palomares and Caro, 1999), therefore, a high risk of FeLV transmission from domestic cats to lynxes is likely. Once an Iberian lynx is infected with FeLV it may readily spread the infection through the lynx population: especially males are expected to play an important role in transmitting the virus as they fiercely fight for territory acquisition and access to females, particularly during the mating season (Ferreras et al., 1997). This could be the explanation why all males from the Coto del Rey subpopulation became infected within a few months. Transmission of the infection to females could follow from mating activities, when the tomcat bites the females.",

            "text": "Since the FeLV strain found in Iberian lynx was highly pathogenic, managers tried to prevent the widespread of the diseases by starting a campaign to vaccinate as lynxes as possible using a Canarypox-based FeLV vaccine (Tartaglia et al., 1993, L\u00f3pez et al., 2009). Although vaccination did not induce sterilizing immunity in domestic cats, it was nonetheless able to stimulate the immune system to a degree that allowed the cats to overcome the infection rapidly and to clear most of the viral RNA from the blood (Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 2007). Therefore, even if immunization does not completely protect lynxes against transient infection, there is justified hope that the outcome of FeLV infection will be less severe. In addition to vaccination, it is also important to decrease the infectious pressure on lynxes arising from domestic cats. Feral cats should be removed from the natural areas inhabited by lynx, and the domestic cats living in houses and villages close to lynx areas should also be vaccinated against FeLV infection to reduce the risk of FeLV transmission to lynxes.",
