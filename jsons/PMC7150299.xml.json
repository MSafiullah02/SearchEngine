            "text": "\nThe cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus, is a New World rodent with a stocky, robust stature (Figure 49.1\n). While the cotton rat has been classified in the family Muridae by one source (Niewesk and Prince, 2002), most sources assign it to the family Cricetidae (Faith et al., 1997, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, 2010, Wilson and Reeder, 2005). Average adult weight is between 100\u2013250 grams. The name Sigmodon derives from the sigmoid enamel loops on the grinding surface of the molar (Faith et al., 1997). Sexual dimorphism is not prominent, but males and females can be distinguished based on the size of the genital papilla and distance from the anus (Faith et al., 1997). The term hispidus refers to pelage with coarse guard hairs (Davis and Schmidly, 1997). The cotton rat is distinguished from the Norway rat by its smaller size, shorter tail, and longer grizzled fur (Hawthorne, 1994). Depending on the source there are up to 14 Sigmodon species (Musser and Carleton, 2005). There is little phenotypic difference between species, but there is striking karyotypic diversity, ranging from 22 chromosomes for S. arizonae to 52 for S. hispidus (Prince, 1994). The lifespan of the hispid cotton rat is less than 6 months in the wild (Cameron and McClure, 1988). In captivity animals have a survival span up to 23 months of age (Faith et al., 1997).",

They nest in burrows approximately 3\u20135 cm in diameter and no longer than 8 meters in length, or in above-ground mounds of grass, weeds, or brush (Davis and Schmidly, 1997). Cotton rats can be nocturnal, diurnal, or crepuscular in the wild, but can change from nocturnal to diurnal under laboratory conditions (Faith et al., 1997, Niewiesk and Prince, 2002\n). In the wild, the cotton rat diet centers around primarily seeds and plants. However cotton rats are known to eat small birds, eggs, and insects (Hawthorne, 2005). In the wild, lifespan is short- between 4\u20136 months (Faith et al., 1997).",

It is likely that this discrepancy is related to anatomical terminology, as necropsy performed on animals from the authors\u2019 institution revealed one left and three right lung lobes, and one accessory lobe. Like many small rodents, the cotton rat has a squamous and glandular region of the stomach, a large cecum, and is coprophagous. The dental formula is I(1/1) C(0/0) P(0/0) M(3/3).

In the wild, males are dominant to females, and adults are dominant over juveniles (Faith et al., 1997). However, in the laboratory environment, they can be maintained as breeding pairs and aggression is seen by females directed toward males. To minimize this problem, some sources indicate breeding pairs should be established at 3 weeks of age (Harlan Laboratories Technical Information, 2010, Prince, 1994). Animals are not sexually mature at this age, and the first litter is not seen until approximately 6\u20137 weeks after mating. However, others recommend separating animals by gender at weaning, and not mating until 5 weeks (Ward, 2001) or 7\u20138 weeks of age (Faith et al., 1997). Both systems seem to be effective, as reproductive parameters are reported to be similar by all sources. When mating, it is recommended that the female be introduced to the male\u2019s cage to minimize the risk of fighting (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002, Ward, 2001). Harem mating with one male and two females can be performed, but this increases the risk of fighting (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002). It is not recommended to separate the male and female at the birth of the litter, or to re-pair animals if one of the pair dies, as aggression is seen in these situations (Faith et al., 1997).",

A post-partum estrus occurs within 12 hours of parturition (Faith et al., 1997, Harlan Laboratories Technical Information, 2010, Niewiesk and Prince, 2002, Sharp and La Regina, 1998, Ward, 2001).

Weaning is typically performed at 2\u20133 weeks of age. The interval between litters is approximately 1 month for continuously mated pairs (Mitchell, 2009, Niewiesk and Prince, 2002).",

Experienced females build nests prior to parturition. The animal becomes restless and muscular fasciculation can be observed along the animal\u2019s side. Grooming of the perineum occurs right before delivery. The female may assist with pulling out and opening the fetal sac. The young are born semi-precocious with a full hair coat (Figure 49.2\n). Eyelids are closed at birth and are generally considered to open at 3 days (Faith et al., 1997, Niewiesk and Prince, 2002, Watkins, 2010). However, Sharp and La Regina (1998) list that eyes open at 1 day. Incisors erupt at 5 days. Niewiesk and Prince, 2002, Faith et al., 1997 indicate that young can survive by this age.",

Lymphocytes respond to stimulation by concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen phytohemagglutinin, and lipopolysaccharide (Faith et al., 1997). Immune response may be affected by age, as control values for splenocyte proliferation indices to concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen have been reported to be slightly lower after 13 weeks of study compared to 7 weeks of study (McMurry et al., 1995). Cotton rats also develop classic delayed-type hypersensitivity and humoral immune responses, but are considered highly resistant to bacterial endotoxin (Faith et al., 1997). An inversion of the lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio is seen between juvenile and adult animals (Faith et al., 1997, Niewiesk and Prince, 2002). The number of lymphocytes found in the spleen (5\u201310 \u00d7 107) is more similar between cotton rats and mice than rats. The lymph nodes are smaller than those in rats and a lack of sacral lymph nodes has been reported (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002).",

However, cross-reactivity of anti-mouse and rat antibody conjugates from a commercial multiplex fluorescent immunoassay with cotton rat IgG is low, which could result in under-reporting of infections (Steffen, 2009). One study suggested that the gastrointentinal flora of the cotton rat is very different than the gastrointestinal flora of other rodents in that anaerobic bacteria are the dominant flora in the stomach and intestines of the cotton rat, in contrast to guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, and mice where lactobacilli are the predominate bacteria (Itoh et al., 1989).",

Macrophage isolation from the peritoneal cavity 2\u20133 days after injection of bacteria or bacterial lysates, and induction of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells from bone marrow have been reported (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002). Chromium uptake of fibroblasts and macrophages in T-cell cytolysis systems is lower than that seen in mice, and spontaneous release or leakiness is high. The mouse lymphoma YAC-1 line has been used for NK activity assays (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002). These authors also report that cotton rat T-cells derived from the spleen or lymph nodes adhere to nylon wool columns at over 90%, which should be taken into account when purifying T-cells from these samples. In addition, they note that cotton rat sera should be incubated at 4\u00b0C for enzymatic B-cell response assays to prevent non-specific findings, and that B-cells do not proliferate well after in vitro stimulation with LPS unless membrane-bound immunoglobulins are cross-linked with antiserum.",

The immune response of the cotton rat was characterized by Pfau et al., 2001, Wilson et al., 2003 and is reviewed by Niewieck and Prince (2002). In addition to polio and typhus research, a wide variety of human and animal pathogens have been studied in the cotton rat, including the measles virus (Wyde, 2000); and development of a measles vaccine was conducted using the cotton rat (Haga et al., 2009, Pasetti et al., 2009). It is also a valuable model for the study of human respiratory pathogens and diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Watts et al., 2008), Everglades virus (Coffey et al., 2004), Metapneumovirus (Williams et al., 2005), human influenza (Jones et al., 2009, Ottolini et al., 2005, Trias et al., 2009), respiratory syncytial rirus (Boukhvalova et al., 2009, Niewiesk and Prince, 2002, Nokes and Cane, 2008), herpes virus (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002), and genital herpes infections (Yim et al., 2005). Other uses have included infectious disease studies of human immunodeficiency virus (Blanco et al., 2009, DeNoon, 1998), Helicobacter pyloris (Mahter et al., 2005), Hepatozoon americanum (Johnson et al., 2007), and nasal colonization of Staphylococcus aureus (Kokai-Kun, 2008, Kokai-Kun et al., 2003\n). Cotton rats have been evaluated as a model for latent and active tuberculosis infection (Elwood et al., 2009) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus infection (Carrara et al., 2007). The cotton rat is the only known rodent model of human adenovirus type 5 (Jackson, 1997). Further, they have also been used for studies of adenovirus-based gene therapy (Niewiesk and Prince, 2002) and as a model for adenovirus-induced ocular disease (Tsai et al., 1992). Cotton rats implanted with syngeneic tumors have been used for the study of oncolytic adenovirus infection (Steel et al., 2007).",
