In mid\u2010December, he developed skin lesions on his chest wall and posterior right lower extremity. At the end of January 2010, he was admitted to the hospital because of suspected rejection. A punch biopsy of the right chest lesion showed large mononuclear cells with prominent, centrally located nucleoli, consistent with amoebae. One week into his hospitalization, the patient became increasingly altered and agitated. CT and MRI scans revealed brain lesions consistent with meningoencephalitis. Granulomatous amebic encephalitis caused either by Balamuthia mandrillaris or Acanthamoeba species was suspected and the patient was started on a broad range of antimicrobials. Despite intensive treatment, the patient deteriorated and was declared brain dead in early February, 2010. Samples of the punch biopsy of the skin, a CSF sample collected 1 wk before death, and skin and brain tissue samples obtained at autopsy were forwarded to CDC and processed for culture, immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) staining, and real\u2010time PCR. Immunofluorescent antibody staining of the punch biopsy was positive for Acanthamoeba. DNA extracted from all types of specimens tested positive for Acanthamoeba in a triplex real\u2010time PCR assay that detects Acanthamoeba spp., B. mandrillaris, and Naegleria fowleri.",

Amoebae grew on the agar plate, ingested bacteria, and multiplied. In about a week, when all the bacteria were gone, the amoebae differentiated into double\u2010walled cysts. The amoebae grew well on the HLF cell culture and destroyed the monolayer within a week. It produced cytopathic effect (CPE) beginning on day 2 of inoculation. The CPE consisted of shrinkage of cell cytoplasm, nuclear pycnosis, and discontinuity of cell sheet resulting in the complete destruction of the cell sheet in about a week. The amoebae grew well at 30 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C in the PYGS medium. The amoebae could also grow at 40 \u00b0C on agar plate coated with bacteria, indicating that they are thermotolerant and have the ability to survive high fever that may occur in patients with GAE. The amoebae when examined under a phase contrast microscope measured 50\u2013125 \u03bcm and exhibited large blunt thorn\u2010like processes, acanthopodia (Fig. 1), from the surface of the body, a feature that is characteristic of Acanthamoeba. The cysts measured 20\u201335 \u03bcm with a smooth, almost round outer wall, the ectocyst, and a thicker, inner cyst wall, the endocyst. The endocysts were mostly star\u2010shaped with five to eight arms or rays, although polygonal endocysts were occasionally seen (Fig. 2). The endocyst was widely separated from the ectocyst except at points where the rays contacted the ectocyst at different planes. The tips of the rays at the contact point appeared to be thick and crescent\u2010shaped and seemed to plug a pore, the ostiole. The crescent\u2010shaped plug, the operculum, was removed when the amoeba exited the cyst (Fig. 2). On the basis of these features, the amoebae were identified as Acanthamoeba sp. Group 1 and designated as CDC:V621.",

However, the resulting electropherograms were of bad quality with overlapping peaks resulting in ambiguous base calling. The full\u2010length 18S rRNA PCR product was therefore cloned to obtain interpretable DNA sequences. Ten recombinant clones were analyzed, each one displaying a unique sequence. The sequence differences between the clones consisted mostly of insertions/deletions and transitions; only three transversions were detected. The length of the 18S rRNA gene was between 2,586 and 2,597 base pairs (primer sequences not included). Eight of the clones were very similar with just two to nine differences scattered throughout the sequence, whereas clones 1 and 6 exhibited more divergence with on average 14 and 42 sequence differences as compared to the other clones. The difference in sequences between the 10 clones is noted in Fig. 3. Despite the sequence variability among the clones, similarity searches via the GenBank server produced the same results for all the clones: the highest similarity (approximately 95%) to Acanthamoeba strains E1 and E9, belonging to the newly described T17 sequence type, followed by A. tubiashi strain ATCC 30867 (89% similarity) and A. comandoni isolates (86\u201388% similarity).",

The amoeba described in this study initially caused skin lesions unresponsive to empiric treatment and subsequently disseminated to the CNS, causing a fatal GAE. Balamuthia mandrillaris, another free\u2010living amoeba, can also cause skin infections and GAE. Acanthamoeba and Balamuthia appear similar in tissue sections and both produce cysts in the tissues. To distinguish these two amoebae in clinical specimens, electron microscopy, immunostaining of tissue sections, or molecular analysis have to be performed. The Acanthamoeba infection in our patient was identified by immunofluorescence testing using rabbit antibodies to Acanthamoeba as well as real\u2010time PCR performed on tissues (D'Auria et al. 2012). Culture isolation of the amoeba from skin and brain tissues was successful and yielded an Acanthamoeba strain designated CDC:V621. This new strain exhibited large trophozoites and cysts characteristic for the Group 1 Acanthamoeba. Molecular and structural analysis of the 18S rRNA gene concluded that it is genetically most similar to the other Group 1 species within the Acanthamoeba genus, confirming the description of CDC:V621 as a new Acanthamoeba Group I strain.",

This is a typical result when there is a mixture of two or more distinct PCR products in the amplified reaction. As discussed in a previous publication, the most likely explanation for this is the sequence variability among the many copies of the ribosomal gene within individual amoebae (Stothard et al. 1998). Acanthamoeba castellanii Neff strain appears to have 700 copies of the 18S rRNA gene in its genome (Byers et al. 1990) and it is reasonable that other Acanthamoeba contain numerous copies as well. The presence of micro\u2010heterogeneity at the 18S rRNA gene level has been detected in strains from all three morphology groups, including Group 1 (Nuprasert et al. 2010; Stothard et al. 1998). An alternative explanation for the sequence difference between the clones, errors produced by the Taq polymerase, may have contributed to some of the point mutations seen in the clones but cannot account for the majority of sequence variation, especially in clones 1 and 6. Thus, we conclude that CDC:V621 has several distinct alleles of the 18S rRNA gene. The greatest sequence difference observed between the clones was 1.7%. Most of the differences were represented as deletions, insertions, or transitions; only three transversions occurred, of which two were in stem 49. Variations between alleles of ribosomal RNA genes in amoebae can be quite substantial. For example, in the amoeba Vannella epipetala the difference between 11 clones was as high as 3.8% (Amaral\u2010Zettler et al. 2006).",

Based on phylogenetic analysis of 18 strains belonging to morphology Groups 2 and 3, Gast et al. (1996) divided the strains into four sequence types (T1\u2013T4) and defined a sequence type as sequences with at least 6% difference from members of the other sequence types. A subsequent study including more sequences from all three morphology groups established the presence of eight additional sequence types (T5\u2013T12) and adjusted the sequence difference threshold between the sequence types to 5% (Stothard et al. 1998). This arbitrary number of 5% dissimilarity has since been used to create five additional sequence types (T13\u2013T17) (Corsaro and Venditti 2010; Gast 2001; Hewett et al. 2003; Horn et al. 1999; Nuprasert et al. 2010). The vast majority of Acanthamoeba isolates from the environment as well as isolates associated with human infections belong to sequence type T4 (Booton et al. 2005; Maciver et al. 2013). In contrast, isolation of Acanthamoeba with Group 1 morphological features is rare. Three species of Group 1 Acanthamoeba, namely A. astronyxis, A. tubiashi, and A. comandoni, belong to sequence types T7, T8, and T9, respectively. The fourth species classified as Group 1, Acanthamoeba echinulata, has not yet been associated with a sequence type as no 18S rRNA gene sequence from that species is available in public databases. Recently, two environmental isolates were found to exhibit Group 1 morphology, but as their 18S rRNA genes differed more than 12% from all known Acanthamoeba sequences, a new sequence type, designated T17, was created for them and added to Group 1 (Nuprasert et al. 2010). The DNA sequences obtained from the amoebae CDC:V621 were approximately 4.3% dissimilar from the T17 strains. Although this is slightly lower than 5% sequence divergence, the phylogenetic analysis clearly distinguishes CDC:V621 as a separate lineage with an evolutionary distance of 2.7% from the T17 strains. Therefore, we consider CDC:V621 as a new and unique sequence type and identified it as sequence type T18.",

Byers (1935\u20132003), Professor of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. Dr Byers was an active member and a tireless worker for the International Society of Protozoologists (now International Society of Protistologists) and responsible for proposing a the new name of The Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology, for the previously named Journal of Protozoology, to attract new interest and provide additional support for the flagging Journal of Protozoology. Dr Byers was responsible for organizing the first Acanthamoeba conference in 1978 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio as at that time the first few cases of AK were described. Now the conference is known as the International Meeting on the Biology and Pathogenicity of Free\u2010Living Amoebae and includes all pathogenic free\u2010living amoebae. Dr Byers was instrumental for using both nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal genes as targets for taxonomic classification and phylogenetic relationships of the genus Acanthamoeba. Dr Byers was a gifted teacher and a tireless research worker, a generous collaborator and a helpful friend of one of the authors (G.S.V.).",
