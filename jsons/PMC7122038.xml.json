These are specimen types commonly used for molecular diagnosisWhole blood: 3\u20135 mls collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube. Store at 4\u201325 \u00b0C. Do not freezePlasma: Collect 7\u201310 mls of whole blood in EDTA, ACD solution A, or PPT sterile tube. Store whole blood at room temperature (18\u201330 \u00b0C) for no more than 4 h. Remove plasma from cells within 4 h of collection by centrifugation at 1,000 \u00d7 g for 10\u201315 min. Do not clarify by filtration or further centrifugation. Store plasma at \u201360 to \u201380 \u00b0C within 30 min of separation. Plasma may also be stored at \u201320 \u00b0C in nonfrost-free freezer for up to 72 h if colder freezer is not available. Ship on dry ice for overnight delivery. The minimum volume of specimen is 2 mls of plasmaUrine: first 10\u201320 mls of voided urine collected in a sterile urinalysis container (15 ml sterile screw cap tube preferred).

Do not freezeTissue: \u223c0.5-cm tissue block collected in a sterile screw-top container, add small amount of saline to keep it moist. Avoid the use of viral transport media to avoid potential inhibition of PCR. Fresh tissues should be stored at \u201372 \u00b0C immediately to preserve the nucleic acidsParaffin-embedded tissue is acceptable. Usually 5\u201310 sections (5 \u03bcm thickness) are sufficient for PCR analysis. The tissue sections must be deparaffinized with xylene before DNA extraction\nFecal: sterile swab (plastic shaft only) or very small fecal sample placed in 1\u20132 mls sterile saline in a container with tight fitting lid. Do not use viral transport media to avoid potential inhibition of PCRSwab: sterile swab (plastic shaft only) placed in 1\u20132 mls sterile saline.

A commercial panel should be used to establish this parameter, if available. Reproducibility is expressed as percent correlation coefficient. For quantitative assays, the CVs range from 10% to 50%Precision: the reproducibility of a test result (e.g., inter- and intratechnologist and inter- and intra-assay)Sensitivity: true positive samples, % of true positive samples above the limits of detectionSpecificity: true negative samples, % of true negative samples below the limits of detection\n\nQuality controls: For quantitative assay, additional quality control procedures should be performed, including calibration and calibration verificationCalibration is the set of operations that establish, under specified conditions, the relationship between reagent system/instrument response and the corresponding concentration/activity values of an analyte. Calibration procedures are typically specified by a method manufacturer, but may also be established by the laboratoryCalibration verification denotes the process of confirming that the current calibration settings remain valid for a methodRecalibration or calibration verification and analytical measurement range validation must be performed at least once every 6 monthsFor each run, sensitivity controls should be included in addition to positive and negative controls. It is recommended that two levels of controls (high and low) should be included\n\n",

            "text": "\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an RNA retrovirus belonging to the lentivirus family. HIV1 and HIV2 are genetically different; HIV2 shares 40% nucleotide homology with HIV1. HIV2 is more related to SIV than to HIV1. Both types appear to cause clinically indistinguishable AIDS. However, it seems that HIV2 is less easily transmitted, and the period between initial infection and illness is longer in the case of HIV2. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV1, and generally, when people refer to HIV without specifying the type of virus, they will be referring to HIV1. The relatively uncommon HIV2 is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhereStructure of HIV virion (Fig. 25.1)HIV virus consists of a spherical viral particle encased in a lipid bilayer derived from host cell covered by protruding peg-like structures composed of gp41 and gp120 glycoproteinsThe virus core nucleocapsid contains the major capsid protein, p24; two copies of genomic RNA; and three viral enzymes (protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase)\nViral replication (Fig. 25.2)The first step of infection is entry into the host cell, which requires binding of the gp120 molecule on the virus to CD4 molecules on the host cell\u2019s surface, and is mediated by the gp41 molecule. Two surface molecules CCR5 and CXCR4, chemokine receptors for beta-chemokines and alpha-chemokines are also required for entryOnce bound, the viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane and the virus\u2019 RNA and enzymes enter the cytoplasmReverse transcriptase catalyzes, first, the synthesis of a DNA copy of the viral RNA and, second, the synthesis of a second DNA strand complementary to the first one. Therefore, a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is generatedIntegrase then facilitates the integration of viral DNA into the cellular chromosome when the cell divides and provides latency enabling the virus to effectively evade host responsesTranscription of the DNA results in the production of RNA. This RNA can serve as the genome for new viruses and can be translated to produce viral proteins. Viral proteins are facilitated by protease and assembled into viral particles using the host cell\u2019s protein-making machineryComplete HIV particles are assembled. In macrophages, HIV buds out of the cell without rupturing the cell, and the cycle begins again. In T cells, HIV exits the cell by rupturing it, effectively killing the cell\nThe gag, pol, and env genes encode for structural proteins for new virus particles. The other six genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu, regulate the synthesis and assembly of viral particlesThe phylogenic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the env gene has enabled classification of HIV1 into three groups: M (major), N (non-M), and O (outlier). The group M of HIV1 infection has been classified into nine different genetic subtypes A\u2013K. More than 90% of HIV1 infections belong to HIV1 group M. Subtype/class B is the most prevalent in the developed worldHIV is transmitted via sexual contact, blood (via transfusion, blood products, or contaminated needles), or passage from mother to child (in utero, during birth, or ingestion of breast milk). Although saliva can contain small quantities of the virus, the virus cannot be spread by kissing. HIV is not spread by the fecal\u2013oral route, aerosols, insects, or casual contact\n",

HIV targets CD4+ T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and Langerhans cells/dendritic cells causing severe immunosuppression and neuropathologic symptoms such as dementia, meningitis, and encephalopathy in the hostCommon opportunistic infections: Pneumocystis carinii, candidiasis, tuberculosis, Cryptococcus, cytomegaloretinitisCommon malignancies: Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma (non-Hodgkin and brain primary), and uterine carcinomaIndividuals who have HIV face a long challenging road. The disease has a steady natural history, starting with an asymptomatic state and progressing toward AIDS. Natural history includes three phasesEarly-stage HIV infection is defined as the presence of HIV with a CD4 count greater than 500. Early stage develops 3\u20136 weeks after initial exposure with self-limited flu-like symptoms resolving 2\u20134 weeks later in 50\u201360% of patients by high level of viral production, viremia, and widespread seeding of lymphoid tissuesChronic phase HIV infection occurs when the CD4 count is between 200 and 500. Chronic phase is associated with a period of latency in which the immune system is intact, but there is continuous HIV replication that may last for years. Patients are either asymptomatic or develop persistent lymphadenopathy with minor opportunistic infections, such as candidiasis or herpes zosterWhen the CD4 count drops below 200, the HIV infection has entered the crisis phase. This is when certain infections that are easily handled by an intact immune system take advantage of this immunocompromised state (opportunistic infections). Certain cancers may also appear for the same reason. When a patient has a CD4 count less than 200 and at least one opportunistic infection or cancer specifically seen in crisis phase HIV, he or she is officially designated as having AIDS\n\n",

Quantitation of CD4 cells was the first effective predictor of HIV progression. The CD4 count is one of many factors (including clinical status, HIV viral load, and medication adherence) that should be assessed before starting or changing antiretroviral (ARV) treatmentThe CD4 cell count (<200 cells/mm3) is important in determining the staging of HIV disease and for indicating the need for prophylaxis against opportunistic pathogensMost laboratories report the CD4 count as part of a list of several types of lymphocytes, as both an absolute count and a relative percentage. Measurement and trending of CD4 percentage in addition to absolute count must be performed prior to initiation or adjustment of ARV treatment management decisionsThe CD4 percentage sometimes is used in coordination with the absolute value to assess the significance of changes in the absolute CD4 count. The absolute CD4 count can fluctuate as overall lymphocyte counts vary, but the CD4 percentage often remains stable during insignificant CD4 fluctuations. CD8 cell (or cytotoxic T cell) counts do not appear to predict clinical outcomesFor monitoring purposes, the CD4 count should be repeated approximately every 3\u20134 months both in stable untreated patients and in patients on stable ART. The CD4 count should be checked more frequently according to the clinical situation\nViral cultureAlthough very specific, single positive culture must be confirmed with a second specimenRarely used due to high cost, labor-intensive, and less sensitivity than antibody testingNegative culture may be caused by technical problems, a defective virus, or the inability of the virus to replicate in culture\nSerological studiesp24 antigenEarly developed assay to detect HIV infection and screen donated blood for HIVAdvantage is to detect HIV infection prior to development of antibodiesDisadvantage is limited utility due to the short window of time and should only be used when other tests are unavailable\nAntibody screening assays (qualitative)Detection of antibodies to HIV is the most common way to diagnose HIV infection in adults and children >18 months oldThese antibodies are usually detectable within 3\u20136 weeks after infectionMost individuals seroconvert by 12 weeks, although may not be detectable for months or yearsThe window period is the time between infection and the development of antibodies. When a person is infected with HIV, it takes a few weeks for the body to make antibodies to the virus. Most people develop antibodies within a month of infection, although some people can take up to 3 months. In very rare cases, it can take 6 months of the test to be positive. In general, repeat testing for HIV should occur at 3 months if there is a significant concern of recent HIV infection. Additionally, because the level of virus in blood is high during the window period, people can more easily transmit HIVSerologic HIV antibody screening testing is highly sensitive (ELISA, rapid test, or home test), but requires followup of preliminary positive specimens with a highly specific HIV antibody confirmatory assay (Western blot) (Fig. 25.3)ELISA method is most common and earliest developed antibody screening assayHome Access HIV1 test system analyzes a dried-blood spot from finger stick collected on filter paper at home and sent to a testing facilityRapid tests for HIV are assays that detect antibodies to HIV within minutes. The rapid test is highly specific: negative means negative except during window period; and the test is also highly sensitive: positive means most likely has HIV, but must be confirmed using Western blot for HIV diagnosis\nConfirmatory antibody assays: Western blotGold standard for HIV diagnostic testingThe virus is disrupted, and the individual proteins are separated by molecular weight via differential migration on a polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a membrane support. HIV serum antibodies from the patient are allowed to bind to the proteins in the membrane support, and patterns of reactivity can be visibly readDetects three major proteins/viral bands: p24 core protein and two envelope proteins, gp41 and gp120/160Reactive WB demonstrates antibody to two of the three major bands; nonreactive WB will have no detectable viral bands (Fig. 25.4)Repeated reactivity by ELISA and reactivity by the confirmatory assay are reported as positive for antibody to HIV1Nonreactive specimens by ELISA or repeatedly reactive by ELISA and nonreactive by the confirmatory assay are negative for antibody to HIV1WB in which serum antibodies bind to any other combination of viral bands is considered indeterminate; followup blood specimen should be obtained 1 month later for repeat HIV antibody testingIndividuals with repeat indeterminate results should undergo further testing using molecular assays, such as PCRAt least as sensitive as and more specific than screening assays, although they are not as sensitive in the detection of early seroconversionDisadvantages: more labor-intensive, more prone to subjective interpretation, and more costly than screening assays\nAlternative antibody screening assay (qualitative)US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved assays that test body fluids other than blood to detect HIV1 antibodies, although sensitivity and specificity are less reliableUtilizes same testing algorithm as serum (ELISA followed by WB)Advantages are noninvasive sample collection, increased safety due to lack of needles, and disposal of infectious waste minimizedOral fluid (oral mucosal transudate): antibodies detectable, but significantly lower (800\u2013 1,000-fold) than those of serumUrine: Interpretative criteria for a reactive WB requires only presence of visible band at gp160 region\n\n\nMolecular methodsQualitative assay: viral identification assays \u2013 recommended for resolving indeterminate Western blot resultsDNA PCR (Roche)The HIV DNA PCR test is a new technology used for HIV early detection testing. The new HIV PCR test looks for the DNA copy of the HIV virus itself in peripheral blood. It is extremely accurate, sensitive, and the cutting edge of HIV early detection testingThe average window period with HIV1 antibody tests is 25 days. Antigen testing cuts the window period to approximately 16 days, and HIV DNA test further reduces this period to 12 daysDetection of HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by PCR is recommended for children <18 months old born to HIV1-infected mothersFalse-positive reactions common due to small amounts of background \u201cnoise\u201d or contaminationAll initial positive DNA PCR reactions must be confirmed with a second PCR test on a separate specimenCurrently, recommended only for detection in infants born to mothers infected with HIV1. However, potential for false-positive result must still be recognizedPlasma HIV RNASurrogate marker of HIV disease progressionDuring acute infection, viral load levels are very high (ranging from 100,000 to over 10 million copies/mL) and detectable before seroconversionImportant to use both a plasma HIV RNA assay and antibody/Western blot testing to establish diagnosis in acute and primary infectionsLow levels of virus (<5,000 copies/mL) may be indicative of a false-positive result and should not be considered diagnostic of primary HIV infection. Standard antibody testing should be repeated\nQuantitativeViral monitoring (Table 25.2 and Fig. 25.5)Amplicor HIV1 Monitor and COBAS\u00ae AmpliPrep/COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae HIV1 Test,v2.0 (Roche) (FDA approved)Quantitation of HIV1 RNA in plasmaStandard assay limit of detection for Amplicor HIV1 Monitor: >400 copies/ml and used for monitoring patient not on ARV therapyUltrasensitive assay and v2.0: as low as 50 or 20 copies/ml and used for monitoring viral loads <400 copies/ml. Viral load results of <50 or 20 copies/mL do not necessarily indicate absence of HIV1 viral replication. Inhibitory substances may be present in the plasma specimen, leading to negative or falsely low HIV1 RNA results. Improper specimen collection or storage may falsely lower the plasma viral load resultsPlasma specimens collected using ACD anticoagulant show quantitative HIV1 RNA levels that are \u223c15% lower than those collected in tubes containing EDTAAcute concurrent illness and/or recent vaccination may cause transient rise in viral loadCalculation of HIV viremia for Amplicor HIV1 Monitor and COBAS\u00ae AmpliPrep test is based on optical density reading. Input QS copies are lot specific and provided with each kit. Standard sample volume factor = 40; ultrasensitive sample volume factor = 4. OD450, optical density at 450nm; QS, quantitation standard. The well with the lowest OD450 reading between 0.2 and 2.0 is selected for calculation. (Figs. 25.6 and 25.7)The HIV TaqMan test v2.0 uses three LTR primers with one FAM-labeled LTR probe in conjunction with four GAG primers and one FAM-labeled GAG probe. Therefore, the v2.0 offers primers and probes that are used to amplify the gag and LTR regions; it also provides diagnostic accuracy of test results even if mutations occur in one of the two regions and compensates for the possibility of mismatch occurring with a primer/probe region. It also ensures enhanced reliability of test results and more confidence in assessing viral loads (Fig. 25.8)A single HIV1 viral load test result should not be used as the only criteria to guide therapeutic decision and intervention in the clinical care of HIV1-infected patients. Viral load results should be correlated with patient symptoms, clinical presentation, and CD4 cell countDue to the inherent variability in the assay, physiologic variation, and concurrent illnesses in the infected patients, <100-fold (<2 log) change in plasma HIV1 viral load should not be considered as significant change\nBranched DNA (bDNA) (Bayer)The VERSANT@ HIV1 RNA 3.0 Assay (bDNA) is a signal amplification nucleic acid probe assay for the direct quantitation of HIV1 RNA in plasma of HIV1-infected individuals using the Bayer@ System 340 bDNA Analyzer. The test can quantitate HIV1 RNA over the range of 75\u2013500,000 HIV1 RNA copies/mlbDNA is based on a series of hybridization procedure followed by an enzyme substrate reaction. The basic principles and procedures for bDNA 3.0 include viral lysis, overnight hybridization of viral nucleic acid, and target capture in a 96-well plate, followed by wash steps and the serial addition of probes that allow for signal amplification, detection, and quantificationbDNA methods have progressed from first generation assays, which were accurate and reproducible but relatively insensitive, to third generation bDNA tests that are accurate, reproducible, highly sensitive, and automated laboratory tests for more optimal patient management. The results of this evolution in bDNA technology are FDA-approved methods for the detection and quantification of HIV1 (VERSANT HIV1 RNA 3.0 Assay)HIV1 present in patient blood is disrupted to release viral RNA\nNucleic acid sequence-based assay (NASBA), NucliSens HIV1 QT assay, NucliSens EasyQ HIV1 assayNASBA is a sensitive, isothermal, transcription-based amplification system designed specifically for the detection of RNA targets. NucliSens HIV1 QT is both FDA approved and CE marked. The NucliSens HIV1 QT is a NASBA with endpoint electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection. Further refinement has led to the development of the CE marked NucliSens EasyQ HIV1 \u2013 a combination of NASBA amplification and real-time detection using molecular beacons utilizing the NucliSens EasyQ analyzerThe NucliSens EasyQ HIV1 assay (bioM\u00e9rieux, Boxtel, The Netherlands) is a quantitative, next generation amplification assay designed to overcome the labor and throughput obstacles in the earlier assaysReal-time detection of amplicons occurs during the NASBA reaction following primer exhaustion and continued production of antisense RNA from the T7 promoter. During the exponential phase of production, amplicons are detected using molecular beacon oligonucleotide probes that fluoresce upon binding to the specific target sequenceThe published performance characteristics of the NucliSens EasyQ HIV1 v1.1 assay show that it is comparable to the NucliSens HIV1 QT, the Versant HIV1 RNA, and the COBAS Amplicor HIV1 Monitor v1.5 assays in linearity, specificity, and reproducibilityAlthough only plasma is FDA approved, can use CSF, lymph tissue, genital secretions, and cellsPurified nucleic acid may be used for other molecular testing, such as sequencing\n\nGenotypingGenotypic resistance testing uses RT-PCR and DNA sequencing techniques to identify the presence or absence of resistance related mutations in the viral genome16 ARV approved for the treatment of HIV (Fig. 25.9). ARV therapy slows the replication of HIV in the body. If patients are infected with HIV and are currently on active ARV therapy but the patients\u2019 viral load continues to increase, then the patients may undergo either genotypic or phenotypic resistance testingPhenotypic testing measures the ability of the HIV1 virus to grow in different concentrations of drug under artificial conditions in the laboratory. Although phenotyping is a direct measure of resistance, it is more complex than genotyping and therefore slower and more costly to performGenotyping testing detects viral sequence change and sequence entire HIV protease (codon 1\u201399) and HIV-RT (codon 40\u2013335) to cover all known drug resistance mutationsNo consensus on genotyping versus phenotyping; however, it is anticipated that genotyping will be used more often because of its greater accessibility, lower cost, and faster turnaround time\nMechanism of resistanceHIV is a highly polymorphic G virus (quasispecies) which during replication converts RNA to DNA by the action of the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme (RT)The RT enzyme has very little proofreading (correction) capacity, and therefore errors are incorporated into the proviral DNA during replication. Over time, these errors, at concise drug binding sites, can provide a selection advantage for the virus in the presence of ARV drugsThe resistant virus predominates with a subsequent increase in viral load. However, the extent of such resistance and the implications for choice of therapy can be determined by reading the sequence of the genes encoding the protease and the RT enzymesTaking medication exactly as prescribed is a very important part of avoiding resistance. Missing doses or not taking them on time lowers the amount of ARV chemicals in the body, which means the virus is not properly suppressed. The virus is then able to replicate faster, increasing the chance of it becoming resistantResistance to some ARVs can limit future treatment options. If HIV is resistant to one drug, it will sometimes be resistant to similar drugs in the same group. This is called cross-resistance and it means that some ARV drugs will not work even if they have not been used before\nIndications for drug-resistant testingDrug-na\u00efve patients with acute or recent infectionTherapy failure, including suboptimal treatment response, when treatment change is consideredPregnant HIV1-infected women and pediatric patients with detectable viral load when treatment initiation or change is consideredTransmitted drug-resistant virus is common in some areas and is more likely to be detected earlier in the course of HIV infection; consider resistance testing earlier in the course of infection\nOne of the FDA-approved assay for DNA sequencing: TRUGENE\u2122 HIV1 Genotyping and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System, Bayer HealthCare, Berkeley, CAIt is a two-step procedure which first amplifies the protease and reverse transcriptase regions of the HIV1 genome using RT-PCRThe amplified DNA is then sequenced to yield to the nucleotide profile of the virus using a sequencing gelOnce the sequence has been generated, it is compared to the wild-type HIV1 sequence and any differences that confer drug resistance are highlighted\nAnother FDA-approved assay for DNA sequencing is ViroSeq\u2122 HIV1 genotyping system, Celera Diagnostics, Alameda, CA (distributed by Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Il)It is a two-step procedure which first amplifies the protease and reverse transcriptase regions of the HIV1 genome using RT-PCR and cycling sequencingThe amplified DNA is then sequenced to yield to the nucleotide profile of the virus using a capillary electrophoresisThe minimum input of viral RNA to the assay should be 1,000 copies/ml when using 1 ml of plasma to be successful in genotyping\nPitfalls of genotypingGenotypic variants comprising less than 20\u201330% of the sample may not be detected as genotyping results reflect the predominate subtypeInterpretation of genotyping results is based on the HIV1 clade B, the most prevalent clade in the developed world. However, other subtypes and recombinants of HIV1 may be undetectedAssessing HIV1 resistance is complicated by the replication kinetics of resistant mutants. Resistant mutants are often less fit than wild-type virus and may become undetectable with selective drugs. Nevertheless, these mutants persist in the patient and when the selective drug pressure is reapplied, the mutants replicate and a resistant population quickly predominates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

HCV is the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis (91%) affecting about 3% of the world\u2019s populationThe most common route of transmission is via blood and blood products, i.e., immune globulin, surgery, and intravenous drug abuse which has significantly reduced with the advent of routine blood screenings. Sexual transmission as well as vertically from mother to infant occurs; the rate of vertical transmission of HCV is 6%HCV is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus that represents the third genus of the family Flaviviridae. The genome encodes for a single open reading frame coding structural (one core and two envelopes) proteins as well as a series of nonstructural proteins (Fig. 25.10)5\u2032 untranslated region: most constant, used for HCV RNA assays and genotypingCore region: constant, used in some genotype assays, core protein assay, PCR\u2013RFLP, and RIBA testsEnvelope region: hypervariable region, associated with high rate of mutation in quasispeciesNS2 region: codes for proteaseNS3 region: codes for protease/helicase, RIBA tests found in this regionNS4 region: c100p antigen used in anti-HCV, RIBA tests targeted this regionNS5a region: codes for interferon response elementNS5b region: codes for RNA polymerase, NS5 antigen used in anti-HCV, RIBA tests target this area\nHCV consists of a heterogeneous group of genotypes based on the sequence homology of 5\u2032 untranslated region. Currently, there are 6 types and over 90 subtypes. Types 1, 2, and 3 distributed worldwide, with types 1a and 1b responsible for approximately 60% of infections. Type 4 occurs primarily in the Middle East, type 5 in South Africa, and type 6 in Hong Kong. In the United States (US), approximately 72% of people infected with HCV have genotype 1, and most others are types 2 or 3 (genotypes 4, 5, and 6 are not common in the US)There is little difference in the mode of transmission or natural history of infection among the different genotypesCure rates with antiviral therapy are notably higher with genotypes 2 and 3, and the duration of HCV therapy is shorter for these genotypesInfection with HCV is curable by therapy, with the current standard treatment based on the combination of pegylated interferon alpha (IFNa) and ribavirin. Virus eradication, characterized by the sustained virological response, i.e., an undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after treatment completion, is achieved in 40\u201350% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and approximately 80% of patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3. The outcome of therapy is influenced by several parameters, including the treatment schedule, disease characteristics, viral factors, and recently identified genetic factors that include single nucleotide polymorphisms located upstream of the gene encoding IFN\u03bb3 (IL28B)MicroRNA-targeted therapy has been suggested as a potential means of combatting the virus but is not currently in use\n\n",

However, during this \u201cwindow period,\u201d a patient will have detectable viral RNA, but have undetectable levels of antibodiesA negative enzyme immunoassay is usually sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of HCV infection in immunocompetent patientsHowever, the test can be falsely negative in those with immunodeficiencies or end-stage renal diseaseConversely, false-positive EIAs may occur in patients with autoimmune disorders. In these patients, an assay for HCV RNA is necessary for diagnosis of chronic infectionOnce patients seroconvert, they usually remain positive for HCV antibody. Thus, the presence of HCV antibody may reflect remote or recent infectionThe immunoblot assay is still useful as a supplemental assay for persons screened in nonclinical settings and in persons with a positive EIA who test negative for HCV RNAOther HCV antibody assays include anti-HCV IgM assays and avidity tests. The significance of the presence of anti-HCV IgM during HCV infection is unclear. Anti-HCV IgMs have been reported in 50\u201393% of patients with acute HCV and 50\u201370% of patients with chronic HCVTherefore, anti-HCV IgM cannot be used as a reliable marker of acute HCV infection and, so far, IgM assays have not been used in clinical practice. However, increasing serial measurements of anti-HCV IgM titers early after the onset of the symptoms may help to identify patients with acute HCV. Alternatively, an increase in the anti-HCV IgG avidity index within a week after the onset of clinical symptoms has also been reported to indicate acute HCV infection. Both parameters could be used together before anti-HCV seroconversion occurs, or when no baseline sample is available to confirm the diagnosis of acute infection\nA total HCV core antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA HCV 3.0) and ORTHO\u00ae trak-C\u2122 assay (Ortho Diagnostics) for detection and quantification of total core antigen in bloodThe HCV core protein is highly antigenic, induces specific cellular and humoral responses, and probably plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HCV infection. The availability of an anticore monoclonal antibody allowed the development of an ELISA to detect HCV core Ag in peripheral blood of patients with HCVIt tests positive for anti-HCV antibodies and for prospective low-risk population screeningTotal HCV core antigen ELISA (quantitative, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics) has sensitivity close to PCR assays in diagnosing acute HCV infection in windows period (before HCV antibodies developed)It is also used in monitoring response to antiviral treatmentThe ELISA HCV 3.0 uses three recombinant antigens (c22\u20133, c200, and NS5) originating from four regions of the viral genome (core, NS3, NS4, and NS5)ORTHO\u00ae trak-C\u2122 assay is a quantitative immunoassay for total (both free and antibody bound) HCV nucleocapsid core antigen. The assay uses a capture ELISA format. The difference between the two assays (ELISA HCV 3.0 and ORTHO\u00ae trak-C\u2122 assay) is a step in this assay that disrupts immune complexes present in the sample. The assay\u2019s intended use is testing for HCV core antigen either during preseroconversion (acute) or postseroconversion (chronic) phases of HCV infectionLess expensive and less prone to carryover than PCR testing and can be used as a rough screen as it correlates with HCV RNA load. However, it is less sensitive than PCR-based assays and individual variation is higherSimilar technology is used by the Architect HCV assay by Abbot Laboratories. The analytical sensitivity of the recently developed Architect HCV assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) varies according to the HCV genotype from 500 to 3,000 international units of HCV RNA per milliliter (IU/mL)A drawback of the total HCV core Ag ELISA is its lower limit of detection, and HCV-positive patients on dialysis often have low HCV RNA levels\nRecombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA)RIBA has been developed for the simultaneous detection of anti-HCV antibodies and HCV core antigenRIBA was used to confirm EIA results since the early generation. It had a high rate of false positivesThird generation of RIBA (RIBA 3.0) was developed to test HCV (which includes NS5 protein) after earlier generations. It has high specificityA new combination assay has been developed and licensed in Europe (Monolisa HCV Ag/Ab ULTRA; Bio-Rad, Marnes la Coquette, France). Monolisa HCV Ag/Ab ULTRA is based on the combination of an indirect test for the antibodies and a sandwich test for Ag detection\n\n\nMolecular methodsQualitative (Table 25.3)The qualitative HCV RNA test is used to confirm HCV diagnosis following a positive or indeterminate antibody test result. It differentiates between resolved and active infection and may be useful for detecting acute infection prior to seroconversion. It is especially useful for confirming diagnosis in people with indeterminate HCV immunoblot (RIBA) results, as well as in immunosuppressed or immunoincompetent individualsRecommended sensitivity for testing is 50 IU/mlAPTIMA\u00ae HCV RNA Qualitative Assay (Gen-Probe)Target amplification based on sequences of the 5\u2032 NC region of the HCV genomeAmplification of HCV RNA via transcription-mediated amplification method (TMA)The detection limit of TMA is 10 IU/ml\nAmplicor HCV test and COBAS Amplicor HCV test, v2.0 (Roche)Use the primers KY78 and KY80 to amplify a 244-bp sequence of within the highly conserved 5\u2032 UTR of the HCV genomeLimit of detection (200 ul): 25\u201350 IU/ml depending genotypes (i.e., 1b = 25, 1a = 50)Use of centrifugation or Ultracolumn (QIAGEN) to process a large volume (1 ml), the LOD can be further improved\n\nQuantitative (Table 25.3)On average 1\u20132 log10 units/ml less sensitive than qualitative testsUsed to establish baseline viral load (prior to therapy) and to monitor changes in viral load during therapyPCR \u2013 Two real-time PCR platforms are currently available for the detection and quantification of HCV RNA: the COBAS TaqMan platform, which can be used together with automated sample preparation with the COBAS AmpliPrep system (CAP\u2013CTM; Roche Molecular System, Pleasanton, CA), and the Abbott platform (Abbott Diagnostic, Chicago, IL), which uses the m2000RT amplification platform together with the m2000SP device for sample preparation (ART).

After hybridization and washing, streptavidin-labeled alkaline phosphatase is added; followed by incubation with a chromogen, which results in the development of a purple-brown precipitate when there is a match between the probe and the biotinylated PCR productHybridization of the amplicon with one or more lines on the strip allows the classification of six major genotypes and their most common subtypes\nThird Wave Technologies\u2019 Invader assay (Third Wave Technologies, Madison, Wisconsin) is a new DNA-scanning method application, which has been termed cleavase fragment length polymorphism (CFLP)Relies on formation of unique secondary structure that results when DNA is allowed to cool following brief heat denaturation and serves as substrates for structure-specific cleavase I enzyme generating a set of cleavage productsFormation of secondary structures is sensitive to nucleotide sequencesThe presence of sequence polymorphisms results in the generation of unique collections of cleavage products or structural fingerprintsIt targets the well-conserved 5\u2032 NCR of HCV\nDetermination of HCV genotype is needed before the initiation of therapy with pegylated IFNa and ribavirin because it determines both the dose of ribavirin and the treatment duration required\nHCV resistance testingSeveral amino acid substitutions that confer resistance to directly acting antiviral molecules, such as protease inhibitors, have been identified. In case of a failure of the triple combination of pegylated IFNa, ribavirin, and either telaprevir or boceprevir, HCV variants that are resistant to these compounds are selectedDirect sequence analysis or reverse hybridization methods can be used to identify amino acid substitutions that confer resistance to antiviral drugsUltradeep sequencing methods, such as pyrosequencing, can detect minor resistant populations down to <1%HCV GenoSure NS3/4A represents the first in a series of HCV drug resistance assays that have been developed at Monogram Biosciences to support the clinical evaluation of HCV direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents and their use in the management of HCV infection. HCV GenoSure NS3/4A analyzes the genetic sequence for the nonstructural proteins NS3 and NS4A of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b that encode for an enzyme essential to viral replication. The assay detects mutations in NS3 and NS4A and specifically identifies those associated with boceprevir and telaprevir resistance\n\nPitfallsIt is important to note that a \u201cgenotype bias\u201d is possible for all HCV molecular assays because of the extensive genetic heterogeneity of the virusFalse-positive results due to contamination (detected by negative control)False-negative results due to amplification inhibition (detected by internal control) or due to a loss of bacteria during specimen preparation\u201cHome brew\u201d PCR assays are not standardized and variations in sample handling and laboratory methods can affect the sensitivity of the assay\n\n\n",

            "text": "\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped dsDNA hepadnavirus. It is 47-nm spherical virus with three important polypeptides: HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) is an envelope protein, HBV core antigen (HBcAg) is a core protein, and HBV e antigen (HBeAg) is an early protein and a nonstructural protein coded by core gene. The envelope protein is involved in viral binding and released into susceptible cells. The inner capsid relocates the DNA genome to the cell\u2019s nucleus where viral mRNAs are transcribedHBV is a circular, partially double-stranded DNA virus of approximately 3,200 nucleotides. This highly compact genome contains four open reading frames encoding the envelope (PreS1, PreS2, S), core (core, precore), polymerase, and X protein (Fig. 25.13)Although hepatocytes are most susceptible to infection, other cell types may be affected to a lesser extent. The life cycle of HBV begins when it attaches to the cell surface. In the cytoplasm, the DNA is still in the core but then capsid is removed and DNA passes into nucleus, where it forms a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)HBV uses the host transcription machinery to replicate its genes and uses RNA polymerase II of the host. The (\u2013) strand of the cccDNA will act as the template for this transcription. After transcription, the mRNAs are translated by the host\u2019s protein synthesis machinery to form viral proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. The proteins are then assembled into virions that are secretedHBV is recognized as endemic in China and other parts of Asia. Over one-third of the world\u2019s population has been or is actively infected by HBVHBV strains are classified into at least 10 HBV genotypes (A to J) and several subtypes and based on the nucleotide homology of the surface gene. Except for the newly identified genotypes I and J, the geographic and ethnic distributions of HBV genotypes and subtypes are well characterized. Genotype A is mainly found in Northwestern Europe (subtype A2), North America, and Africa (subtype A1 or A3), whereas genotypes B and C have been described in Southeastern Asian populations. At present, genotype B is divided into B1\u2013B6 subtypes. Among them, B1 is isolated in Japan, B2\u20135 are found in East Asia, and B6 is found in indigenous populations living in the Arctic, such as Alaska, Northern Canada, and Greenland. Genotype C, including subtypes C1\u2013C5, mainly exists in East and Southeast Asia. Genotypes E and F are seen in East Africa and the New World, respectively. Genotype D is most often found in southern Europe, parts of Central Asia, India, Africa, and the Middle East. Genotype G is a recently determined genotype in France, America, and Germany while genotype H has been reported in patients from Central America. Recently, genotype I, a novel intergenotypic recombination among genotypes A, C, and G, was isolated in Vietnam and Laos. The newest HBV genotype, J, was identified in the Ryukyu islands in Japan, and this genotype has a close relationship with gibbon/orangutan genotypes and human genotype CAcute infection with genotypes A and D results in higher rates of chronicity than genotypes B and C. Compared to genotype A and B cases, patients with genotypes C and D have lower rates of spontaneous HBV e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion; when this occurs, it tends to be delayed. Hepatitis genotypes C and D have lower response rates than genotypes A and B. Genotype C is also more associated with severe liver disease, including to hepatocellular carcinomaThe rate of new HBV infections has declined by approximately 82% since 1991, when a national strategy to eliminate HBV infection was implemented in the US. The decline has been greatest among children born since 1991, when routine vaccination of children was first recommended\n\n",

For infants, the mode of transmission is from the mother via the placenta, during delivery or during breast-feedingFor adults, CMV transmission occurs from close contact with individuals excreting virus in saliva, urine, and other bodily fluids. Transmission of CMV has been reported from blood transfusion and organ transplantBy the age of 30, approximately 40% of individuals are infected by CMV; by the age of 60, 80\u2013100% of the population has been exposed to the virusHuman CMV is difficult to culture as it slowly grows only in human fibroblasts since CMV is very specific in term of species and cell type to be infected\n\n",

CMV can be sexually transmitted and can also be transmitted via transplanted organs and blood transfusions. Infectious CMV may be shed in the bodily fluids of any previously infected person, and thus may be found in urine, saliva, blood, tears, semen, and breast milk. The shedding of virus may take place intermittently, without any detectable signsThe incidence of primary CMV infection in pregnant women in the US varies from 1% to 3%. Healthy pregnant women are not at special risk for disease from CMV infection. When infected with CMV, most people have no symptoms and very few have a disease resembling mononucleosis. But can be severe and life-threatening in immunocompromised patients including organ recipients and AIDS patients. It is their developing unborn babies that may be at risk for congenital CMV disease and occurs in about 1% of all newborns. 10\u201320% of these infants will develop complications before school age. CMV remains the most important cause of congenital viral infection in the USIn infants and young children, typical features of the infection include hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary cutaneous erythropoiesis and thrombocytopenia, and petechial hemorrhages.

It also called CMV inclusion body detection. It is used to evaluate and manage CMV infectionThe CMV cytologic and histological diagnosis is often considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for diagnosing end-organ disease. Conventional H&E stains reveal enlarged (cytomegalic) cells that are often two- to fourfold larger than surrounding cells, usually with large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions, sometimes surrounded by a clear halo, and smaller cytoplasmic inclusions. Its sensitivity shows ranging widely from 10% to 87%. It is important to note that 37.5% of patients with gastrointestinal CMV disease fail to demonstrate any inclusionsImmunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies directed against CMV immediate early antigen increases diagnostic yield of CMV compared to routine H&E staining. Sensitivity of immunohistochemistry for detecting CMV infection can approximate 93%\nAdvantagesSpecific and definite diagnosisConfirm end-organ disease along with virus infection diagnosis\nPitfallsInvasive procedure requiredInsensitive\n\nViral cultureConventional cultureViral culture is the traditional method of virus detection for demonstrating viremia and sometimes for establishing end-organ disease. Conventional CMV culture involves isolation of the virus in fibroblast tissue culture where it produces a distinctive cytopathogenic effect that is easily confirmed by fluorescent antibody stainsPresence of the virus (positive cultures) can often be determined in as little as 1\u20132 days, but cultures that are negative for the virus must be held for 3 weeks to confirm the absence of CMV because the virus may be present in very low numbers in the original sample and/or the CMV strain may be slow-growingCMV culture can be performed on blood, tissue, urine, saliva, or respiratory swabs. Blood culture has a sensitivity of 45\u201378% but a very high specificity, approaching 89\u2013100% for detecting disease. CMV detection in blood is more strongly associated with disease than detection in urine or saliva, with a positive predictive value of 60%AdvantagesGold standard test for CMV detectionAble to recover other viruses from the same specimen\nPitfallsLow sensitivity compared to newer techniques, such as antigenemia and PCR and nucleic acid probeLack of virus quantitationA long incubation period (1\u20133 weeks), lack of virus quantitationFalse-negative results if cell culture inoculation is delayed\n\nShell vial assayAnother CMV culture (shell vial culture) method is rapid viral culture. The shell vial culture with immunofluorescence staining is used for the early diagnosis of CMV infectionIn immunocompromised patients, a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 100% have been claimedSpecimens are centrifuged into fibroblast monolayers, incubated briefly, and then stained with a fluorescent monoclonal antibody to early antigens, before the appearance of cytopathogenic effect. Results are available much earlier than with conventional CMV culture, usually within 24\u201348 hThe cells are read under a fluorescent microscopeAdvantagesHigher sensitivity than conventional methodsQuantitative shell vial cultures are available, but not widely used\nPitfallsMay need large amount of biomass for virus recovery\n\n\nSerological studiesCMV antibody testingAntibody testing can be used to determine if someone has had recent or past exposure. There are two types of CMV antibodies that are produced in response to a CMV infection, IgM and IgG, and one or both may be detected in the bloodIgM antibodies are the first to be produced by the body in response to a CMV infection. CMV IgM antibodies are detected within a week or two after primary infection and lasts 3\u20134 months. After several months, the level of CMV IgM antibody usually falls below detectable levelsIt is not detectable in recurrent infection except in immunocompromised patients where it is detectable in about a third of the casesCMV IgG antibody is produced early in primary infection and provides protection from primary infections. Levels of IgG rise during the active infection then stabilize as the CMV infection resolves and the virus becomes inactive. After a person has been exposed to CMV, he or she will have some measurable amount of CMV IgG antibody in their blood for the rest of their lifeCMV IgG avidity test to distinguish primary CMV infection from past or recurrent infection (reactivation or reinfection). CMV IgG avidity is low (<30%) in primary infectionPrenatal diagnosis of congenital CMV infection is performed only in the case of primary maternal infection as transplacental transmission of CMV is higher in 40% of primary maternal CMV infection. Whereas it is low in the case of recurrent infection 1\u20134%CMV IgG antibody testing can be used, along with IgM testing, to help confirm the presence of a recent or previous CMV infection\nCMV antigenemia testThis test is based upon the detection of pp65, a structural protein expressed on the surface of infected polymorph nuclear lymphocytesThe specimen must be processed within 6\u20138 h of collection, but results can be available within 8\u201324 hThe number of infected leukocytes present had been reported to correlate with the severity of infectionThis test is usually applied to blood and cerebrospinal fluid, with a sensitivity of 60\u2013100% and a specificity of 83\u2013100%Commercial kitThe CMV Brite\u2122 Turbo Antigenemia Kit uses the well-defined C10/C11 antibody cocktail to detect the CMV lower matrix phosphoprotein (pp65), an early antigen in virus replication, which is abundantly present in antigen-positive polymorphonuclear cellsThe CMV Brite Turbo Kit is a rapid new version of the first FDA-registered immunofluorescence antigenemia kit for in vitro CMV diagnosis\nAdvantagesInexpensive kits are commercially availableMay be able to detect CMV before development of symptoms\nPitfallsLabor-intensiveRequire skilled personnelSubjective interpretationAlthough an improvement over CMV viral culture, this technique is only semiquantitative, and the reading of results is somewhat subjectivePoor sensitivity in urine samples. The assay is adversely affected by low leukocyte counts\n\n\n\nMolecular methods (Table 25.5)GeneralCMV DNA tests can be qualitative or quantitative. The two major techniques used are hybrid capture and PCR. PCR appears to be more sensitive than hybrid captureDifferent tissues and body fluid compartments can be used for PCR including whole blood, plasma, leukocytes, buffy coat specimens, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, target organ tissue, or stool. Whole blood PCR testing is more sensitive than plasma PCR testingHigher CMV viral loads seem to correlate with symptomatic diseaseStool CMV DNA testing is a technique that is noninvasive and would detect infection even when located in the right colon, out of the reach of a sigmoidoscopic examination. Stool CMV DNA also is possibly more sensitive than blood CMV DNA for detecting colonic disease, as it is more organ specificCMV DNA testing in blood is a very promising technique for diagnosing CMV disease. Its advantages include quick results (6\u201348 h) and high sensitivity\nQualitativeCMV DNA by hybrid capture assay (Digene): FDA clearedThe Digene Hybrid Capture CMV test is a molecular assay that detects the presence of CMV DNA in white blood cells from blood collected in EDTA. It is more sensitive than CMV culture and has a sensitivity and specificity comparable to the CMV antigenemia assay for the detection of CMV viremiaUnlabeled CMV probes hybridized with viral DNA, then immobilized on a solid phase before being measured by conjugated antihybrid antibody\nCMV mRNA by NASBAAssay of CMV mRNA by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) has been investigated for the detection of active viral gene expression and replicationCMV-specific mRNA may be a more specific marker for CMV than culture or DNA PCR since it would theoretically be indicative of CMV replicationSince late transcripts such as pp67 mRNA reflect a complete replication cycle of CMV, they could be indicative of diseaseNucliSens CMV pp67 Assay (Organon Teknika Inc., Durham, NC) is an FDA-cleared test. NucliSens CMV pp67 measures replication of CMV in blood using NASBA RNA amplification technologyThis assay detects messenger RNAs coding for the matrix tegument protein pp67 of CMV, a true late protein, which is only expressed during viral replicationThe NASBA technology selectively amplifies RNA in a DNA background and allows direct testing in whole bloodIt is a direct route for diagnosing an active CMV infection and monitoring treatment efficacy\n\nQuantitativePCRAmplicor CMV MONITOR test (Roche Molecular Systems) is a quantitative microtiter-based PCR assayCMV viral DNA in the specimen was quantitated by coamplifying a region of the CMV DNA polymerase gene in the presence of a known quantity of quantitative standardThe primers used were specific for the CMV polymerase gene and amplified a 362-bp fragment of the geneAn internal quantitation standard (QS) that is added at a known concentration during specimen processing so that extraction and recovery of DNA, in addition to amplification and detection, can be monitoredThe lower limit of sensitivity of the assay is 400 copies/ml of plasma. The linear range of the assay is 400\u2013400,000 copies of CMV DNA per mLThe inherent sensitivity of molecular detection of CMV poses a problem since latent CMV genomes, present in most seropositive individuals, may be detected. Therefore, it is critical to adjust the sensitivity of the PCR so that latent genomes are not detected\nAdvantagesSensitive enough to detect virus before symptom developmentSpecimen could be stored and transportedRapid and less expensive\nPitfallsFalse positiveContamination must be prevented\n\nReal-time PCRThe COBAS\u00ae AmpliPrep/COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae CMV Test is a real-time PCR-based quantitative assay for CMV DNA detection in human plasma using the COBAS\u00ae AmpliPrep Instrument for automated specimen processing and the COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae Analyzer or COBAS\u00ae TaqMan\u00ae 48 Analyzer for automated amplification and detection. The test can quantitate CMV DNA over the range of 150\u201310,000,000 copies/mLVarious home brew methods were developed either using real-time TaqMan PCR (ABI prism 7700) or real-time LightCycler PCRAdvantagesQuick result: turnaround time for the real-time PCR assay is 6\u201348 hHigh sensitivityCMV DNA testing also has greater than 80% concordance with CMV antigen test results, but also has the added benefits of increased specimen stability, smaller required specimen volume, and with the ability to be performed in patients with depressed white blood cell counts results\nPitfallsFalse-positive results due to contamination (detected by negative control)False-negative results due to amplification inhibition (detected by internal control) or due to a loss of bacteria during specimen preparationThere is a lack of standardization of this process, with different techniques and assays, different quantitation methods, and different tissues and blood compartments being tested, thus making interpretation of results across studies challenging. Quantitative PCR is more sensitive than qualitative PCR, and CMV DNA values obtained with \u201cin-house\u201d quantitative assays are 3- to 10-fold higher than the commercial assayDifferent quantitation methods include reporting results as genomic copies/mL, copies/mL, copies/microgram of total DNA, copies/106 leukocytes, and copies/2 \u00d7 105 leukocytes; such varied quantitation methods can make comparison of results almost impossibleNo clearly defined cutoff values for determining CMV disease, this method has low specificity and low positive predictive value. Most of CMV cutoff on plasma ranging from 400 to 10,000 copies/mL of CMV DNA\n\n\n\nAntiviral susceptibility testing of CMV isolatesGeneralResistance of CMV to antivirals was a major clinical problem in patients with AIDS. Currently marketed anti-CMV drugs, namely, ganciclovir (GCV), its oral prodrug valganciclovir (vGCV), foscarnet (FOS), and cidofovir (CDV), all target the viral DNA polymeraseCMV infection remains a major problem in transplantation, and resistance to antivirals is encountered in all forms of transplantationIn general, it takes weeks to months for CMV to develop resistance to antivirals. In patients with AIDS, some studies showed a 10% prevalence of resistance to ganciclovir by 3 months of therapy; similar time courses were found for foscarnet and cidofovir\nPhenotypic methodsPlaque reduction assayThe gold standard for antiviral susceptibility testing of CMV is plaque reduction assayIn this assay, a standardized inoculum of a stock virus is inoculated into cultures and incubated in the presence of the antiviral agentThe cultures are then observed for the presence of viral plaquesThe IC50 of the agent for the isolate is defined as the concentration of agent causing a 50% reduction in the number of plaques producedPlaque reduction assays are labor-intensivePlaque reduction assays are limited by the excessive time required completing the assay (4\u20136 weeks) and the lack of a standardized method validated across different laboratoriesIn addition, repeated passage of isolates to prepare viral stocks may influence the results of assays by selecting CMV strains that are not representative of the original population of the viruses\nDNA hybridization assayWhole genomic DNA is extracted and transferred by capillary action onto negatively charged nylon membranes after incubation with a specific agentThe membranes are hybridized to a 125I-labeled human CMV probe (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, Ohio), rinsed, washed, and counted in a gamma counterMean hybridization values (in counts per minute [cpm]) for each concentration of antiviral agent are calculated and expressed as a percentage of the cpm in control culturesThe IC50 is defined as the concentration of antiviral agent resulting in a 50% reduction in viral nucleic acid hybridization values (i.e., DNA synthesis) compared with the hybridization values of controlsDisadvantage of DNA hybridization assays is that they require the use of radiolabeled probesDNA hybridization assays have the advantage over plaque reduction assays of eliminating the variation due to subjective errors resulting from plaque counting by different individuals\nViral load assays (e.g., antigenemia or quantitative DNA)CMV viral load assay may rise as an indicator of antiviral resistance, but other factors (including compliance and declining immune function) may be responsibleThe assay can measure viral DNA concentration exposed to a range of drug concentrations and is grown for 4 days in the presence or absence of drug then the IC50 is determinedQuantitative antigenemia assays are less exact than quantitative polymerase chain reactionIn many patients, certain CMV diseases (e.g., gastrointestinal disease or retinitis) are not always associated with measurable viral loads\nOther phenotypic methods: Viral production is measured by using immunofluorescence-, immunoperoxidase-, ELISA-, or flow cytometry-based methods for detection and quantitation of cells expressing CMV antigens (immediate\u2013early, early, or late)\nGenotypic methodsGeneralViral UL97 kinase and UL54 DNA polymerase gene mutations are well-documented mechanisms of resistance to current antiviralsThe mutation of the viral phosphotransferase gene (UL97) coding sequence, which may confer resistance only to ganciclovir (GCV). One of seven canonical UL97 mutations (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, and C603W) is found in over 80% of GCV-resistant clinical CMV strainsAlthough UL97 mutations do not affect susceptibility to FOS or CDV, UL54 mutations can confer resistance to all current drugs and may emerge after prolonged GCV therapy to increase the level of resistance conferred by a preexisting UL97 mutation. Mutations in UL54 are often accompanied by mutations in UL97, showing higher levels of resistance to ganciclovir with possible cross-resistance to foscarnet and/or cidofovirThe viral polymerase gene UL54 occurs in regions between codons 300 and 1,000 (Fig. 25.19)\nGenotypes for CMV antiviral resistanceDetection of mutations is based on PCR amplification of the specific region of the genome followed by restriction enzyme analysis or direct sequencing of the amplification productStandard dideoxy sequencing can detect an emerging resistance mutation when it exceeds approximately 20% of the sequence populationPyrosequencing has been reported to detect mutant subpopulations at an approximately 6% level at codons 460, 520, and 592\u2013607 of UL97, but the short sequence reads are unsuitable for analyzing the full range of codons needed for genotypic diagnosis (e.g., UL97 codons 335\u2013670 and UL54 codons 300\u20131,000)An additional method \u201creal-time PCR\u201d with melting curve assay can also detect drug resistance mutations. The advantages are that low copy numbers without cell culture can be detected, mixed virus populations can be analyzed semiquantitatively, and multiplex reaction to different mutations can be detected simultaneously. The disadvantages are that polymorphisms near known mutations may affect the melting curve and give false-positive result and different probes are needed to identify each mutated codon. Besides, the assay may not be able to differentiate different point mutations that occur in the same codon, such as M460I (ATT/ATA) and M460V (GTG)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Humans are the only known reservoir for HPVPapillomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses of icosahedral symmetry with 72 capsomeres that surround a genome containing double-stranded circular DNA with approximately 8,000 base pairsThe expression of viral genes is closely associated with an epithelial localization and linked to the state of cellular differentiation. Most viral genes are not activated until the infected keratinocyte leaves the basal layer. Production of virus particles can occur only in highly differentiated keratinocytes. Therefore, virus production only occurs at the epithelial surface where the cells are ultimately sloughed into the environmentOver 100 genotypes of HPV have been identified based on DNA sequence heterology. A specific group, termed high-risk genital HPV types (especially 16, 18, 31, 45, and 58, but also 33, 35, 39, 51, 52, 56, 59, 68, 73, 82), is recognized as a necessary factor for the development of cervical cancerThe genome HPV virus is circular (Fig. 25.22). The genome has eight open reading frames that encode ten proteins. The genes for these are divided into an early region that are expressed in the skin\u2019s infected basal cells that have yet to differentiate, and a late region with two genes whose protein products exist only in cells after cell differentiation\nThe E5 (changes the cellular responses to programmed cell death or apoptosis), E6 (binds to tumor suppressor protein, p53), and E7 (binds and inactivates retinoblastoma protein, Rb) proteins are early viral proteins expressed upon infection and cause destabilization of the infected cell and induces replicationAs the cell differentiates, it migrates upward and induces expression of the E1, E2, and E4 genes; E1 and E2 cause viral replication and E4 destabilizes the cytoskeleton and prevents cellular differentiationIn the upper epithelial cell layers, the late viral proteins L1 (major capsid protein) and L2 (minor capsid protein) are expressed. They bind the viral DNA and autoassemble, giving rise to the complete virions, ready for a new infection that is released as the keratinocytes desquamateThe most common mode of transmission is via contact; i.e., sexual or autoinoculation\n",

The vast majority of infected adults experience transient infectivity and are unaware of the condition; however, they may be able to infect othersHowever, most women infected with high-risk HPV, especially women under 30 years of age, do not develop cervical cancer. Their immune system effectively clears the infection over the course of several monthsSpecific factors that determine which HPV infections persist and develop into squamous intraepithelial lesions currently are unknown. Cigarette smoking, ultraviolet radiation, pregnancy, folate deficiency, and immune suppression have been implicated as possible cofactorsLow-risk HPV types (6, 11, 42, 43, and 44) produce benign epithelial tumors of the skin and mucous membranes. Infection with certain types of HPV (high risk) can also increase the risk of developing cervical and other cancer types. Conditions associated with HPVVerruca vulgaris (common wart) \u2013 associated with HPV2, HPV4, and HPV40. Highly contagious and can spread to other sites of skin or mucous membranes via autoinoculationCondyloma acuminatum (venereal wart) \u2013 associated with HPV6, HPV11, HPV16, and HPV18 and is considered a sexually transmitted disease with lesions occurring in sites of sexual contact or trauma (i.e., mucous membranes of genitalia, perianal region, oral cavity, and larynx)Flat warts are most commonly found on the face or forehead and are most common in children and teensPlantar warts are found on the soles of the feetSubungual and periungual warts form under the fingernail (subungual) and around the fingernail or on the cuticle (periungual) and are a subtype of the common skin wart. They may be more difficult to cure than warts in other locationsButcher warts are caused by HPV7 and occur in people handling meat, poultry, and fishFocal epithelial hyperplasia (Heck disease) is caused by HPV13 (and possibly HPV32) and commonly occurs in Native American and Inuit populations. A childhood condition characterized by multiple soft, nontender flat papules and plaques of the oral mucous membraneLaryngeal papillomatosis \u2013 frequently recurs and may require repetitive surgery when interferes with breathing. Rare cases can progress to laryngeal cancer (HPV30 and HPV40)HIV-associated papillomatosis \u2013 HPV7 and immunocompromised statesCervical cancer \u2013 History of HPV (high-risk types) infection is strongly associated with development of cervical cancer. However, most HPV infections do not progress to cervical cancer. Because the progression of transforming normal cervical into cancerous cells is a slow process, cancer occurs in people who have been infected with HPV for a long time, usually over a decade. High-risk HPV types 16 and 18 are together responsible for over 70% of cervical cancer cases; type 16 alone causes 41\u201354% of cervical cancersAnal/rectal cancer \u2013 Although rare, anal/rectal cancer is becoming more prevalent in the US. Similar to cervical cancer, the main cause of anal cancer is HPV and is most commonly acquired through anal intercourse. However, anal cancer can also be acquired from other genital areas that are infected with HPV, particularly from the vulva or penis. High-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33 and 35) are associated with anal squamous intraepithelial lesions and account for approximately 80% of cervical and anal cancersHead and neck squamous cell cancer \u2013 HPV16 is the most common type detected in head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs). HPV16 accounts for 78.6\u2013100% of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cases. HPV type 18 accounts for 1% of oropharyngeal, 8% of oral cavity, and 4% of laryngeal HPV-positive SCCs. HPV16 and HPV18 genotypes are associated with a better prognosis in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Furthermore, the HPV-positive tumors are also more sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy. Coinfections are possible and most frequently include HPV16. HPV33 is often reported and has been identified in up to 10% of HPV-positive HNSCCs. Numerous other HPV types have been rarely detected in HNSCCs and include types 6, 11, 35, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68Other cancers \u2013 HPV (including 16, 18, and 31) may also cause vulvar, nonmelanoma skin cancers, and (rarely) penile cancer.

            "text": "\nInfluenza is part of the Orthomyxoviridae family and can be classified into three basic types, influenza A, B, or C (Table 25.10). Each influenza virus type is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus that shares structural and biological similarities but differs antigenically. Type A influenza virus which causes pandemic is found in a variety of warm-blooded animals. Types A and B are predominantly human pathogens. Type C is found in humans and pigsInfluenza viruses have a segmented RNA genome (Fig. 25.25). Influenza A and B contain eight distinct segments and are covered with surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix 2. Influenza C has seven segments and one surface glycoprotein. The viruses are typed based on these proteins. For example, influenza A (H3N2) expresses hemagglutinin 3 and neuraminidase 2Influenza is a dynamic virus that may evolve in two different ways via antigenic drift and antigenic shift resulting in genetic diversity. Antigenic shift occurs when two different strains of influenza viruses combine with antigenically different HA and NA by reassortment of viral RNA segments; this process occurs every 10\u201340 years. Antigenic drift occurs by random point mutation in viral RNA leading to amino acid substitutions in HA glycoproteins. Influenza type A viruses undergo both antigenic shift and drift; influenza type B viruses undergo antigenic driftEach influenza RNA segment is further encapsulated by nucleoproteins to form ribonucleotide\u2013nucleoprotein complexes surrounded by matrix proteinsInfluenza virus infections rank as one of the most common infectious diseases in humankind. However, influenza may potentially cause severe epidemics and kills an average of 20,000 individuals in the USInfluenza virus infection occurs after transmission of respiratory secretions from an infected individual to a person who is immunologically susceptibleA number of different subtypes are classified within the influenza A type based on two viral surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The most common prevailing human influenza A subtypes are H1N1 and H3N2. Each year, the distributed vaccine contains A strains from H1N1 and H3N2, along with an influenza B strain. A novel influenza A H1N1 strain emerged in March 2009 and is the causative agent of the current public health emergencyIn March 2009, an outbreak of influenza-like illness occurred in Mexico and the US; the CDC reported seven cases of novel A/H1N1 influenza. Preliminary genetic characterization found that the hemagglutinin gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses present in US pigs since 1999, but the neuraminidase and matrix protein genes resembled versions present in European swine flu isolates. The six genes from American swine flu are themselves mixtures of swine flu, bird flu, and human flu virusesRecently, several studies reported the novel A/H1N1 strains carried a prominent amino acid change at position 222 (D222N) within the primary hemagglutinin receptor binding site. Previously, enhanced virulence associated with the change, D222G, has been clinically linked to severe morbidity and mortality\n\n\n",

The adamantane drugs (amantadine and rimantadine) are approved for influenza A, while the neuraminidase inhibitor drugs (zanamivir and oseltamivir) are approved for both influenza A and influenza BTo date, 2009 H1N1 influenza, influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses have been detected by surveillance. All three virus strains typically are sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir, but the influenza A strains have been resistant to the adamantanes. While, sporadic oseltamivir-resistant 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus infections were identifiedThe oseltamivir-resistant 2009 influenza A (H1N1) is commonly described point mutation in the virus neuraminidase gene (histidine to tyrosine at position 275 of the N1 neuraminidase, commonly referred to as H274Y in N2 numbering), which is known to confer high-level resistance to oseltamivirInfluenza viruses A (H1N1) carrying the H274Y mutation have reduced ability to replicate and transmit efficiently when compared with parental, susceptible virus, but the clinical implications of infection with these viruses have been largely unknownRT-PCR along with sequencing (Sanger sequence or next gen sequence such as pyrosequence) is usually used for influenza antiviral resistance test\n\nSensitivity and specificitySensitivity of DFA methodology is dependent upon adequacy of the specimen, i.e., >20 cells. Otherwise, specimen may be inadequate for accurate interpretation resulting in false negativesRapid diagnostic testing is approximately >70% sensitive for detecting influenza and approximately >90% specific. Thus, as many as 30% of samples that would be positive for influenza by viral culture may give a negative rapid test result; some rapid test results may indicate influenza when a person is not infected with influenza\nPitfallsDue to the length of time required to perform viral culture, the assay has poor efficacy as results are obtained much after the patient has left the office or well past the time when drug therapy could be effectiveDevelopment of PCR-based assays must always consider antigenic drift and random mutations due to viral evolution that may result in false negatives\n\n\n\n",
