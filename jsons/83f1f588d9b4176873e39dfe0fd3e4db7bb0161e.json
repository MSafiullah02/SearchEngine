Although there is paucity of high-quality evidence to guide ECMO practice in many areas, these recommendations are based on available evidence, [12] [13] [14] existing best practice guidelines, 15-24 experience from previous infectious disease outbreaks, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] ethical principles, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] and consensus opinion from experts.

Centers should develop polices for handling the diseased patients. Adhere to local policies on lab transfer of infectious materials ECMO centers should have protocols and guidelines for handling of medical wastes from a COVID-19 patient on ECMO Steps should be taken to enable effective two-way communication (e.g., walkie-talkies or dedicated phones) with personnel outside the isolation room for assistance or equipment 102 All nondisposable components of the ECMO circuit must be properly disinfected after use for COVID-19 patients, as per local guidelines for surface disinfection of medical equipment Routine exhaust gas scavenging is not recommended. If plasma leak or other damage to oxygenator fibers is suspected, oxygenator or circuit change is recommended while donning optimal PPE. Institutional policies on environmental disinfection should be followed in such instances Position the ECMO circuit so that it can be monitored by the specialist through the cubicle door without opening it Consider performing ECMO cannulation within a designated COVID-19 environment and avoid transfers to catheterization lab or operating rooms where possible Dedicated ultrasound machines and echocardiography probes are highly desirable. Appropriate disinfection measures should be followed as per hospital guidelines after use COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; PPE, personal protective equipment. \u2022 The definition of irreversible heart or lung failure may depend on the patient and the resources at the institution. In each case, a reasonable timeline for organ recovery or replacement should be set early in the course. \u2022 For cardiac failure, for example, no meaningful cardiac recovery at 5-7 days in a patient who is not a candidate for durable device or transplant may be considered futile in most centers. \u2022 For lung failure, futility of a prolonged run should be established on a case-by-case basis. Although resources may not allow prolonged ECMO runs during a pandemic, caution should be exercised when establishing futility of care in younger patients with isolated respiratory failure. \u2022 Cessation of ECMO support can be both morally and ethically challenging decision, and this can be heightened during pandemic-related resource constraints. Physicians should not make such decisions in isolation. We recommend early ethics team consultation, multidisciplinary team discussion with family while establishing expectations and goals of care at the time of ECMO cannulation. \u2022 Appropriate end-of-life care should be provided to patients to ensure a comfortable and dignified death. Centers should develop a family visitation policy for all patients, more so during end-of-life care and utilize videoconferencing technology to overcome restrictions on visitations. \u2022 We recommend debriefing the staff in situations where there is a high risk of moral injury, acknowledging the time constraints in a pandemic.
