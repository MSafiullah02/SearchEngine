In this study, we focused on the anti-PEDV and anti-proinflammatory cytokine secretion mechanisms of GLY. We found that PEDV infection had no effect on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protein and mRNA levels, but that TLR4 regulated PEDV infection and the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, we demonstrated that TLR4 regulated p38 phosphorylation but not extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (Erk1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) phosphorylation, and that GLY inhibited p38 phosphorylation but not Erk1/2 and JNK phosphorylation. Therefore, we further explored the relationship between high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and p38. We demonstrated that inhibition of HMGB1 using an antibody, mutation, or knockdown decreased p38 phosphorylation. Thus, HMGB1 participated in activation of p38 through TLR4. Collectively, our data indicated that GLY inhibited PEDV infection and decreased proinflammatory cytokine secretion via the HMGB1/TLR4-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 pathway.",

The causative agent of PED is PED virus (PEDV), which emerged in Asia, America, and Europe and causes high mortality rates in suckling piglets [1] [2] [3] . PED was initially reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. Recently, outbreaks in swine-raising countries worldwide have led to tremendous economic losses [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . PED is a significant public health concern because PEDV is a potential threat to humans [8] . PEDV, an enveloped RNA virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense genome, rapidly becomes epidemic in nearby pig farms [9] [10] [11] .",

GLY is extracted from licorice, which has many pharmacological and biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-viral effects [12] [13] [14] [15] . GLY contains one molecule of glycyrretinic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid (823 Da) [16, 17] . GLY has inhibitory effects on hepatitis C virus (HCV) [18, 19] , herpes simplex type 1 [20] , influenza virus [21] , and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus [22] . GLY is also a high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) inhibitor. Extracellular HMGB1 involves a damage-associated molecular pattern to activate proinflammatory signaling pathways through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [23, 24] . HMGB1 is a unique mediator of inflammation-associated events and innate immune responses [25] . We previously showed that GLY inhibited PEDV [26] , but the anti-PEDV mechanisms of GLY remain unclear.",

The MAPK pathways play a critical role in transmitting signals to the intracellular environment and exquisitely controlling numerous cellular activities. Three distinct MAPKs have been identified on the basis of the respective terminal MAPK components, namely, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), MAPK p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) [27] [28] [29] . The MAPK pathways play vital role in viral infection including foot-and-mouth disease and influenza [30, 31] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(SARS-CoV) 3b protein induces activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcriptional activity through activation of JNK and ERK pathways, and SARS-CoV 3b protein has an important role in the stimulation of AP-1-dependent genes, especially proinflammatory cytokines causing the cytokine storm during SARS virus infection [32] . The MAPK p38 pathway is a key regulator of inflammatory responses [33] [34] [35] [36] . Human coronavirus 229E and transmissible gastroenteritis virus wuhan 1 (TGEV WH-1) replication requires MAPK p38 activation [37, 38] . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation depends on p38 MAPK signaling [39, 40] . Infection and inflammation of influenza A virus are inhibited on the basis of TLR4-MAPK p38 pathways [41] . HMGB1 promotes the synthesis of proinflammatory interleukin (pro-IL)-1\u03b2 and proinflammatory interleukin (pro-IL)-18 by activation of MAPK p38 [42] , and acts in synergy with LPS to augment IL-6 production, which depends on MAPK p38 and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation [43] .",

PEDV infection had no effect on TLR4 expression, but we further explored whether TLR4 regulated PEDV infection. We pretreated Vero cells with the TLR4 inhibitor TAK for 2 h and then infected the cells with PEDV (0.1 MOI) in the presence of various concentrations of TAK for 24 h. Vero cells and supernatants were collected for Western blotting, plaque formation assays, and qRT-PCR.

Immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) confirmed that TAK reduced PEDV infection rate about 79% at 10 \u00b5M concentration ( Figure 2B ). In addition, TAK caused reductions in viral open reading frame (ORF3) mRNA levels at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M ( Figure 2C ). The plaque formation assay showed viral titer in the supernatant of cells was reduced by about 95% at 10 \u00b5M concentration ( Figure 2D ). These results suggested that TAK inhibited PEDV infection in a dose-dependent manner, and furthermore that TLR4 potentially regulated this infection. In addition, TAK reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs, namely, IL-1\u03b2 (88%), IL-6 (93%), IL-8 (98%), and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) (97%) during PEDV infection ( Figure 2E ).

As the MAPK pathways play a vital role in viral infection, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus and influenza A virus infection, we therefore assessed the roles of the MAPK p38, Erk1/2, and JNK pathways during PEDV infection. Phosphorylation of p38, Erk1/2, and JNK was assessed by Western blotting in Vero cells infected with PEDV (0.1 MOI) at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 h post-infection (h.p.i.). As shown in Figure 3A ,B, PEDV infection stimulated robust phosphorylation of p38 at 8, 12, 24, and 36 h.p.i. These effects were especially apparent at 24 (4.4 times) and 36 (5.3 times) h.p.i. (Figure 3A ,B). However, JNK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were only increased at 36 h.p.i. compared with mock-infection Vero cells ( Figure 3A ,C,D). Levels of p38 phosphorylation were monitored during early PEDV infection and during persistent PEDV infection. However, JNK and Erk1/2 phosphorylation were only monitored at 36 h.p.i. In addition, we revealed that MAPK p38, JNK, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation were induced at 48 h.p.i., and that phosphorylation was higher at 48 h.p.i. than 36 h.p.i. [45] . Phosphorylation of p38 was induced at 24 h.p.i., whereas JNK and Erk1/2 phosphorylation were not induced until 24 h.p.i. This result suggested that p38 might play a vital role in PEDV infection from 24 h.p.i. onwards. ",

            "text": "HMGB1 is a ubiquitous and conserved DNA-binding protein that was discovered over 30 years ago and participates in DNA replication and maintenance of nucleosome structure [47, 48] . Extracellular HMGB1 can activate proinflammatory signaling pathways through TLR4 [23, 24] . HMGB1 is a unique mediator of innate immune responses and inflammation-associated events [25] . Our previous study indicated that PEDV infection caused release of HMGB1, and that the HMGB1 competitive inhibitor GLY inhibited PEDV infection and attenuated proinflammatory responses by inhibition of HMGB1 [44] . Therefore, we explored the relationships between HMGB1, PEDV infection, and proinflammatory cytokine production during PEDV infection. Extracellular HMGB1 can bind to TLR4. Thus, we assessed the expression of TLR4 during PEDV infection. We found that PEDV had no effect on levels of TLR4 protein or mRNA. These results were inconsistent with our hypothesis. TLR4 and MAPK p38 play an important role in influenza A virus replication and inflammation responses. TLR4 has an antiviral effect on mouse hepatitis virus [49] . The MAPK p38 pathway is a key regulator of inflammatory responses [33] [34] [35] [36] . HMGB1 binding to TLR4 triggers cytokine release under the prerequisite of both a disulfide bond between C23 and C45 and a reduced C106 of HMGB1 [46] , and our previous study corroborates the fact that extracellular HMGB1 binding to TLR4 promotes inflammatory responses [26] . Therefore, we speculated that TLR4 might regulate PEDV infection and that inflammatory responses depended on activation of signaling cascades. We explored the effect of TLR4 on PEDV infection and proinflammatory cytokine. We revealed that the TLR4 inhibitor TAK significantly attenuated viral infection, judging by the observed downregulation of viral protein, viral RNA, and viral titer, as well as decreased proinflammatory cytokine production. These results implied that although PEDV infection had no effect on TLR4, TLR4 regulated PEDV infection through activation of signaling cascades. Our previous study showed that PEDV infection caused acetylation and the release of HMGB1, which binds TLR4 [44] . The MAPK pathways are involved in cell death [50] , and play a vital role in infection of coronaviruses, such as mouse SARS-CoV and hepatitis virus [51, 52] . Therefore, we assessed whether TLR4 induced signaling cascades depended on the MAPK pathways in this study. We found that early PEDV infection activated p38, and that activation of p38 is continuous during PEDV infection. This phenomenon is consistent with a previous study [53] . Maximal activation of p38 was observed at 12 h.p.i. in a previous study [53] , which was inconsistent with our results. In addition, activation of JNK and ERK1/2 was only observed at 36 h.p.i.; this is inconsistent with a previous study [54] . Lee et al. and Kim et al. showed that activation of JNK or ERK1/2 occurred at 12 and 24 h.p.i., but that activation of JNK or ERK1/2 was not required for productive PEDV infection at 36 and 48 h.p.i. [53, 54] . The reasons underlying these discrepancies may be relate to differences between PEDV strains, and thus require further exploration. Our results showed that only p38 phosphorylation was induced at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h.p.i., suggesting that activation of p38 might have a vital role during PEDV early infection. We thus focused our efforts on p38. We explored the effect of the p38 inhibitor SB on PEDV infection and proinflammatory cytokine production. We confirmed that the p38 inhibitor SB inhibited PEDV infection and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production.",

Our results showed that GLY decreased the activity of p38 dependent on TLR4 activation. However, GLY caused slight increases of phospho-JNK and Erk1/2, which was consistent with our results using the TLR4 inhibitor TAK. This phenomenon was surprising and requires further study. In addition, inhibition of HMGB1 using an antibody, site-specific mutations (HMGB1-C45S, HMGB1-C106S, and HMGB1-C45S/C106S), and siRNA knock-down decreased p38 activation.

(A) Levels of phosphorylated and total MAPK p38, ERK1/2, or JNK were analyzed by Western blotting. \u0392etaactin was used as a loading control. Levels of phospho-p38/total p38 (B), phospho-JNK/total JNK (C), and phospho-Erk/total Erk (D) were plotted using ImageJ. (E,F) Vero cells were treated with different doses of an anti-HMGB1 antibody for 2 h and then infected with PEDV (0.1 MOI) in the presence of anti-HMGB1 antibody for 24 h. (E) Levels of phosphorylated MAPK p38 and total MAPK p38 were analyzed by Western blotting. (F) Fold change in phospho-p38/total p38 ratio were plotted using ImageJ. (G,H) Vero cells were transfected with control pCAGGS (name of vector) plasmid (PCA) or plasmids encoding mutant HMGB1 (C45S, C106S, or C45S/C106S) for 24 h, and then infected with PEDV (0.1 MOI) for 24 h. (G) Levels of phosphorylated MAPK p38, total MAPK p38, and wild-type or mutant HMGB1 were analyzed by Western blotting. (H) Fold change in phospho-p38/total p38ratio were plotted using ImageJ. (I,J) Vero cells were transfected with small interfering HMGB1 (siHMGB1) to silence HMGB1 expression for 24 h. SiNC (an irrelevant small interfering RNA (siRNA)) was used as a negative control. The cells were infected with PEDV for 24 h. (I) Levels of total and phosphorylated MAPK p38 and of HMGB1 were analyzed by Western blotting. (J) Levels of phospho-p38/total p38 were plotted using ImageJ. p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant (* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01). Bars represent standard deviations.",
