A clear impact of the major intervention measures on the reproduction number (R t ) has been found in all studied countries and territories, as already suggested by the drop in the number of deaths over time. Interestingly, the impact of such major intervention measures seems to be the same in most of these countries. The model has also provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections, active cases and future outcome. While the predictive capabilities of the model are much more uncertain before the peak of the outbreak, we could still reliably predict the evolution of the disease after a major intervention by assuming the afterwards reproduction number from current study. More challenging is to foresee the long-term impact of softer intervention measures, but this model can estimate the outcome of different scenarios and help planning changes in the implementation of control measures in a given country or region.",

            "text": "The ongoing pandemic expansion of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused over 3,500,000 detected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and claimed over 240,000,000 lives worldwide as of 5 May 2020 [1] . After the first epidemic wave has dramatically hit a large number of countries, we can learn from all available epidemiological data to understand the evolution of the disease in order to better prepare the healthcare capacities for future pandemic waves. A recent model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on estimates of seasonality, immunity and cross-immunity from past virus pandemic data, indicates the high risk of recurrent outbreaks for the coming years, according to different scenarios [2] . Before the availability of effective vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments, the transmission of the disease can only be controlled by prevention measures, like personal hygiene habits, social distancing, case detection and isolation, or contact tracing. Strict social distancing enforced by the authorities has been the strategy of choice by the majority of countries in this first epidemic outbreak, implemented as different measures in each country (imposing or encouraging home confinement, closing schools and workplaces, or banning assemblies and gatherings, among others). Given that this usually involves a strong economical and behavioural impact in the society, it is urgently necessary to understand the evolution of the disease in each country or territory and estimate the effect of implementing such control measures. A major problem is that in most countries, only a small portion of the infected individuals is detected, and as a consequence, undetected contagious patients are the major cause of the expansion of the disease, which is the main limitation to foresee the effect of intervention measures. In the absence of large-scale detection tests applied to the entire country population, mathematical modeling can help to estimate the dynamics of infections based on available epidemiological data. Indeed, a recent networked dynamic metapopulation model using Bayesian inference and based on reported infections and mobility data suggests a high proportion of undocumented infections in the first SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within China [3] . That model compared the initial transmission dynamics with that after greater control measures were taken, showing a clear reduction in the transmission rate and the effective reproduction number. However, the specific impact of the different control measures was difficult to analyze at that time.",

A major assumption of that study was that the intervention measures had the same relative effect in all countries, which is not necessary true. For instance, according to Location History data from Google [5] , the effect of lockdown measures on the mobility of the population was clearly different in each country. The level of isolation of transmitting cases not only depends on the intervention to the general population, but also on the percentage of detected patients, which might make more or less effective the isolation of such patients.",

Since the peak of the outbreak had not yet been reached in the studied countries, the impact of intervention could be followed based solely on small changes in the slope of the growth of reported deaths over time, with a large degree of uncertainty. Moreover, for some of the intervention measures, not sufficient time had passed to see a real impact on the number of deaths. As a consequence, the impact of the intervention measures of most of the countries were probably underestimated, and the forecast anticipated a larger number of expected infections and deaths than that found in the following weeks.",

The resulting ITD probability distribution is shown in Figure 1B . The infection fatality ratio (IFR) is the probability of death for an infected case. The values used here for COVID-19 are derived from previous estimates [8] and are calculated for each country according to the age-distribution population [6, 7] . For La Rioja, I used the same IFR as for Spain. For Iceland, I initially used the general IFR value of 0.657% previously reported by combining estimates of case fatality ratios with information on infection prevalence in China [7] . This IFR estimate provided an expected number of infected and active cases close to the detected ones. However, the case fatality rate (CFR), an empirical value obtained from the number of deaths over the detected cases, gives a value of CFR=0.556% for Iceland, and the true IFR could be even smaller [9] , so I decided to use this CFR value (0.556%) as a better estimate for IFR in Iceland. The IFR values used in the study here for the different countries are shown in Table 2 . In this model, the expected number of new infections Ij occurring in a given day j is a function of the number of infections I k in the previous k=1...j-1 days, according to a serial interval (SI) distribution, and the reproduction number (R t ) (eq. 2).",

In the case of Iceland, both the observed number of daily deaths and the reported daily cases were fitted, because the observed deaths did not have sufficient sample for reliable fitting. Following the initial procedure [4] , I have included only observed deaths from the day after a given country had cumulatively observed over 10 deaths (d 10 ), given that the early stages of the epidemic in a given country might be dominated by infections that are not local. I did an exception in the case of small regions or countries with low number of deaths, such as Iceland and La Rioja, in which I included observed deaths from the day of the first death (d 1 ). Similarly, according to the original procedure [4] , the initial infections of the model were assumed to be 30 days before this d10 (or d1) day, starting with 6 consecutive days with the same number of infections, which was left as a parameter to optimize in the fitting procedure. The initial infections for the first 6 days and the R 0 and R t values after each intervention were defined as parameters to optimize in the model. Fitting was done in the probabilistic programming language Stan, using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler. Eight chains for 4000 iterations, with 2000 iterations of warmup and a thinning factor 4 were run. Running of 200 sampling iterations with 100 warmup iterations yielded very similar results in most of the cases, suggesting that convergence was achieved early in the fitting process.

In Figure 2 we can compare some random discrete distributions for expected deaths over time for samples of different size (n=1, 10, 100, 1000) according to the continuous infection-todeath probability distributions used here vs. several discrete samples derived from the same infection-to-death distribution. As the sample size (n) increases, the discrete and continuous distributions tend to converge, but for small size samples, assuming continuous distribution might not represent a given instance. Figure 1B , while for samples of larger size (e.g. 100 or 1000 deaths), the discrete distributions get closer to the probability distribution curve. Therefore, for a better visual comparison between the predictive results of our model and the set of reported deaths over time (discrete distribution), I have generated instances of discrete distributions over time of the expected number of new infections and deaths computed with the parameters obtained during fitting procedure (usually, from a set of parameters randomly selected among the ones obtained). These instances were generated by randomly assigning every case (from the set of new infections or deaths to be distributed) to a specific day according to the serial interval and infection-to-death probability distributions.",

Regarding the relative values of R t after intervention (in percentage relative to R 0 before intervention), they ranged from 12.0% (Spain) to 20.7% (Italy). These values seem to depend not only on the effectiveness of the intervention measures, but also on the evolution of the disease prior to intervention, described by R 0 , which seems to be different in each country ( Table 3) . As a warning note, this effect in relative terms was the one assumed to be fix for the same type of intervention in the different countries in the original application of the model [4] , an assumption that does not seem to be valid.",

In all cases, after intervention, R t is significantly reduced to a value well below 1 and the number of new infections decreases. I have estimated the effects of additional interventions, such as a work lockdown period ordered in Spain and La Rioja region between 1 and 6 April 2020 (see Supplemental  Table 1 ), or a contention period around 7 March 2020 in La Rioja after a very localized outbreak in the city of Haro (data not shown), but no significant improvement of the model was found (Supplemental Figure 1) . I have also modelled the effect of an additional intervention in Iceland (on April 3 rd , a recently released mobile app to trace infections had almost 75,000 downloads, which might have had an impact in the reproduction number). While in this case the general estimations of daily deaths do not change too much (Supplemental Figure 1) , we do observe some better estimation of infections and a smoothing of reproduction numbers (see Supplemental Table 1 ). In general, one would expect that a series of stepwise interventions will have a smoother effect on the reproduction number (and therefore in the number of new infections) that just a single strict intervention. One could also speculate whether other early measures taken in some countries have contributed to decrease their initial R 0 values or to delay initial number of infections at the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, but this is beyond this study.",

In the graphical plots of estimated daily cases and deaths ( Figure 3) we can visualize the predictions for a few days beyond the last day of data (May 5, 2020). In general, in countries where more time has passed from the peak of the outbreak (e.g. Spain, Italy), the variability in the estimated data beyond the last day of data is smaller than in countries in which fewer days have passed from the time of the peak (e.g. Germany, UK). As a validation test, in order to evaluate the capabilities of the model to predict the evolution of the disease beyond current date, I have fitted it again to Spain and La Rioja data, after removing the reported deaths corresponding to the last week, the two last weeks or the three last weeks of data in Spain and La Rioja ( Figure 6B -D,H-J). Table 5 shows the reproduction numbers, and the estimated number of deaths for the last week of data (April 29 to May 5) obtained by the model when different sets of dates are removed. In general, we can observe that the more dates are removed and the fewer days left after the peak of the outbreak, the more uncertain the predictions get. Indeed, the predicted R t values obtained after removing larger sets of dates increasingly deviate from the ones obtained with the entire set of dates. Similarly, the number of deaths predicted for the last week of data increasingly deviate from the reported ones when larger sets of dates are removed. However, the response of the model to removal of data is different in the two cases analyzed here. In the case of Spain, the mean vale for the predicted deaths in the last week does not dramatically deviate from the real one even when 3 weeks are removed, although the uncertainty increases (the 95% CI range increases with respect to the ones obtained with the entire set of dates). We could safely say that three weeks ago the model would have been able to reasonably predict today's situation in Spain (as for May 5 th , 2020). In the case of La Rioja, the predictions get worse much faster upon removal of data, with larger deviations of Rt and worse prediction of deaths for the last week of reported data. Perhaps this different behaviour of the model with shorter data is related to specific features of the disease evolution in each territory, or maybe it is simply due to differences in sample size (i.e. removing dates from regions with already small number of reported cases can introduce larger uncertainty).",

As we can see in Table 5 , while the R 0 values are not dramatically different, the resulting R t values are completely wrong, which indicates that the model cannot estimate the impact of the intervention on the reproduction number before achieving the peak of the outbreak. This was actually the situation of the original study on 11 countries on March 28 [4] , when the peak of the outbreak was still >1 week away in the majority of the analyzed countries. Consistent with the validation test here, in those conditions (>1 week before the peak) the model underestimated the impact of the different intervention measures and predicted a much higher number of infections and death than the reported ones in the upcoming days.",

This validation test suggests is that in cases in which the epidemic outbreak is not clearly over the peak, especially when the available data is noisy (e.g. small sample size), it could be a better option to apply the model using a guess value of R t =0.625 rather than trying to predict such R t value by fitting.",

In these moments, it is urgent to evaluate the possible outcome of the planned changes in current transmission control measures. For instance, in Spain (including La Rioja), there are three phases proposed for the gradual return to normality. Two key dates are 11 May 2020, the beginning of Phase 1 for most of the regions, in which meetings of up to 10 people will be allowed, and bar terraces will be opened (with some limitations), and 22 June 2020, the proposed date for the end of Phase 3, in which some regions can go back to a certain \"normality\", allowing sports and cultural shows (with some conditions), as well as national travel. We can devise different scenarios regarding the potential effect on the reproduction number due to the gradual removal of lockdown measures in these key dates. Some options are: i) no changes in R t (very unlikely), ii) slight increment to Rt =0.71 similar to current situation in Germany (also quite unlikely, given the activities that are planned to be allowed), iii) further increment to Rt = 1.0, which implies doubling the number of patients actively transmitting the disease (this could be a likely scenario for the phase between 11 May and 22 June), or iv) much larger increment to R t = 1.8, similar to the situation in Iceland at the beginning of the epidemic, e.g. normal activities allowed but with extensive testing and isolation of detected infections (this is a likely scenario after 22 June). I have evaluated all these options for Spain and La Rioja, and the results are shown in Supplemental Figure 2 (Spain) and Supplemental Figure 3 (La Rioja). There is a further possible scenario that we can evaluate, which is the possible return to total normality in 1 September 2020, with open schools, usual sports and cultural shows, etc., so I have added this variable in Supplemental Figure 4 (Spain) and Supplemental Figure  5 (La Rioja). We can see that in some of these scenarios, the possibility of a new epidemic outbreak is clear. Figure 7 shows in more detail the predicted evolution for Spain in La Rioja in a likely scenario, with R t = 1.0 between 11 May and 22 June, and R t = 1.8 afterwards. Assuming these reproduction numbers, we can foresee an outbreak in mid-September/October. Obviously, the model does not consider the possible intervention measures to limit the impact of this hypothetical outbreak, which might depend on how early the potential new infections could be detected. For comparison, assuming the same scenario in Iceland (R t = 1.0 between 11 May and 22 June 2020, and Rt = 1.8 afterwards), no outbreak is predicted in the studied period, even when assuming return to complete normality on 1 September 2020 (data not shown). The model can thus be useful for evaluating the long-term impact of the implementation and/or removal of intervention measures on the disease evolution in a given country or region.",

However, here I am assuming that R is constant along long periods of time, and only change upon a specific intervention. While this assumption seems to be adequate to estimate abrupt changes in R after major interventions, in many situations R can change over time in a more subtle way, for instance depending on local actions, such as disease transmission control in specific communities (e.g. elderly residences, hospitals), or on behaviours changing over time, like self-awareness of the population. This seems the case in Iceland, in which R0 is smaller than in other countries, probably because of a better control of the first detected cases thanks to a higher detection rate. Inclusion of a more dynamic R t may lead to significant improvements of the model, but also to increased noise in the fitting process unless more data can be considered.",

This seems to be the case in Italy, in which the fitted model expects a single peak after a major intervention, while the distribution of reported deaths over time seem to have a shoulder after the main peak ( Figure 3 ). This might indicate spreading from the initial focus to the rest of regions, which can largely affect the transmission dynamics in Italy [21] . While this geographical transmission is not explicitly considered in the model, its application can be a complement to other studies aiming to understand the evolution of the disease in time and space.

Here, the model has been updated, and have independently applied it to countries and regions with high number of reported cases, or high-incidence related to their population. I have found that major intervention measures have a similar impact on the disease transmission in most of these countries, and I have provided realistic estimates of the total number of infections, active cases and future outcome. The model can also be useful to help planning changes in the implementation of control measures, but the reliability of the long-term predictions may depend on the moment of the epidemic outbreak.",
