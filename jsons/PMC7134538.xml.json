In recent years, many attempts have been made to develop some sensible mathematical models for investigating the dynamics and asymptotic behaviors [3\u20136]. Mathematical models take into account foremost factors that govern improvement of a disease, such as vaccination, transmission, recovery etc. The most important factor in the epidemic is asymptomatic or unapparent, where the infectious diseases spread incessantly throughout the population without showing symptoms. Individuals with asymptomatic infection are still infectious and supply to the dissemination of the disease from one human to a different [7, 8]. Asymptomatic diseases can decline the immune system and make individuals susceptible to other diseases. When a subclinical infection is not noticed by the infected individual, it is dangerous not only for infected individuals but also for other people around him. These infections are very risky for certain association of people such as pregnant women. The asymptomatic situation may not be identified until the patient undergoes medical tests (X-rays or other inquisition). Therefore, some people may remain asymptomatic for a remarkably long period of time and even they also died. This type of infection exists for many diseases, like measles, influenza etc. [5, 7].",

There is a vast variability in the construction of vaccination models in epidemiology which entirely depends on the disease and the type of vaccines. Some vaccines may be greatly effective against infection while others may be unsuccessful in various respects like degree, duration, infectiousness, and progression etc [9]. The most frequent vaccination plan is to immunize all individuals, where the spread of various infectious diseases can be prevented by giving vaccination at a regular rate to the susceptible population on pre or post level [10\u201312]. The pre-vaccination of susceptible may reduce the level of an epidemic, which was studied by the several researchers [9, 13, 14]. The cohort (or pre-vaccination) is considered in [9], where a proportion of newly recruited individuals are vaccinated. While the impact of post vaccination is studied by a number of researchers [15, 16], and obtained that, to eliminate the disease from the population, vaccination rate must be larger than the critical vaccination coverage otherwise the disease persists in the population. But only a few numbers of researchers studied both vaccination strategies simultaneously at the same time [17, 18].",

Saturation incidence rate seems more sensible than the bilinear incidence rate because of it includes the behavioral change and crowding effect of the infective individuals and prevents the unboundedness of the contact rate by choosing suitable parameters [15, 27, 28]. Longini Jr et al. [29, 30] and Germann et al. [31], proposed models by including two classes of infective persons, namely, symptomatic infective with clinical symptoms and asymptomatic infective with no or negligible symptoms. A model to include the asymptomatic stage in a standard SARS epidemic model to study the treatment and chemoprophylaxis strategies and their effects on enlarging of the disease is proposed by Stilianakis et al. [32]. According to our knowledge, the role of asymptomatic infection on the transmission dynamics of influenza was never analytically explored. It is thought that, asymptomatic cases and asymptomatic infection of influenza occur regularly [33, 34].",

Through its character, asymptomatic flu cases are difficult to diagnose. Therefore, it is impossible to specifically define the number of asymptomatic cases. As a result, clinical evidence of asymptomatic infection is enormously limited and the size of its donation to spread of flu is tough to determine. Longini Jr et al. [29], assumed that the chance that a person will be symptomatic given that person has been infected is 0.67, based on population-level influenza cohort studies in the U.S. Furthermore, they assumed that an asymptomatic infection is only 50% as infectious as a symptomatic infection. Intuitively, there might be a considerable difference in the respective transmission probabilities from asymptomatic and symptomatic person to susceptible [8]. Obviously, an infected person with clinical illness sheds additional virus than does one with sub-clinical symptoms. Alternatively, infected persons with clinical symptoms may show reduced contacts if they are sufficiently ill to be restricted to bed. For clear discussion, the readers are referred to Hsu and Hsieh [8] and references therein. The aforementioned modeling studies with asymptomatic stage utilize complex models and simulation studies to explore the role of sub-clinical infection in intervention strategies.",

Another model was proposed by Samsuzzoha et al. [41] and studied uncertainty and sensitivity of the basic reproduction number of a vaccinated epidemic model of influenza. From these models, it is observed that the model is given in [15] is not applicable in the case if the symptoms of infectious diseases are not shown (e.g., influenza and measles diseases). Also, in the model proposed by Samsuzzoha et al. [41], the authors do not consider the case in which the infection is asymptomatic and the effect of vaccination on the infected or infectious individuals is not discussed. Hence, the model is extended by incorporating a new compartment for the infectious individuals, when they will remain in an asymptomatic stage without showing any symptoms and also consider pre-vaccination and post-vaccination strategies.",
