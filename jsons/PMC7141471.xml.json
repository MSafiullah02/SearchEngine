In at-risk individuals, these so-called HERG blockers can precipitate DI-TdP or, worse, DI-SCD, especially with long-term use (Table 1\n). As a result, the number of DI-SCDs attributable to hydroxychloroquine in particular is not trivial (Table 1). With the theoretical possibility that a substantial proportion of the world population could receive hydroxychloroquine as first-line prophylaxis or treatment, including an estimated 3 million individuals with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), the number of hydroxychloroquine-mediated DI-SCDs could increase precipitously unless appropriate QTc monitoring algorithms are instituted. This risk of DI-SCD could be further amplified if multiple medications, each with their own QTc-prolonging/torsadogenic potential (ie, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and/or lopinavir/ritonavir), are used in combination (Table 1).",

Ultimately, it comes down to identifying the small subset of individuals who, either secondary to an underlying genetic predisposition (such as congenital LQTS, which is present in 1 in 2000 people) and/or by virtue of the presence of multiple modifiable and nonmodifiable QTc risk factors (Table 2\n),17 have excessive baseline QTc prolongation (QTc \u2265500 ms) and/or have an inherent tendency for development of an exaggerated QTc response (ie, \u0394QTc \u226560 ms) following exposure to medications with the adverse effect of potential QTc prolongation (Figure 1\n). Although the percentage of individuals at risk is small, given the pandemic nature of COVID-19, in absolute terms the number of individuals potentially at risk for lethal adverse drug effects is large (at least 4000 individuals of the >400,000 COVID-19\u2013positive patients worldwide are expected to be at increased risk for DI-TdP/DI-SCD if treated with these medications).

Alternatively, some FDA-approved consumer mobile ECG devices are capable of generating accurate QTc measurements.19 To this end, AliveCor, Inc, just received emergency clearance from the FDA for use of the KardiaMobile 6L device (FDA-approved for atrial fibrillation detection) for QTc monitoring of patients with COVID-19 treated with QT-prolonging medications such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (March 20, 2020, 1:15 PM CST).

For example, in younger patients with COVID-19 (ie, <40 years) who have only mild symptoms and a QTc of 500 ms or greater, it may be reasonable to avoid treatment altogether because the arrhythmia risk may outweigh the risk of development of COVID-19\u2013related acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, in patients with a QTc of 500 ms or greater presenting with progressively worsening respiratory symptoms or at greater risk (ie, >65 years of age, immunosuppressed, and/or high-risk comorbid conditions) for respiratory complications, the potential benefit of QTc-prolonging COVID-19 pharmacotherapies may exceed the arrhythmia risk. Therefore, the ultimate goal of QTc surveillance in the COVID-19 pandemic should NOT be to identify those who cannot receive these medications but to identify those with compromised or reduced \u201crepolarization reserve\u201d in whom increased QTc countermeasures can and should be taken to mitigate the risk of drug-related death from DI-TdP/DI-SCD.25\n",

The timing of on-therapy QTc surveillance will be dictated not only by the pharmacokinetics of the COVID-19 therapies used but also by the practical logistics of an institution\u2019s method of QTc monitoring. For the 12-lead ECG approach, if QTc surveillance is deemed important, then one machine should be designated for acquisition of the data and a limited number of ECG technicians/personnel should be used to minimize PPE utilization and personnel exposure. Also, the number of on-therapy QTc assessments should be constrained to minimize personnel exposure risk and PPE consumption. In this scenario, for those placed in red light status because their baseline QTc is 500 ms or greater, an initial on-therapy QTc should be obtained around 2 to 4 hours after the first dose and then again at 48 hours and 96 hours following treatment initiation. Patients receiving either green light or yellow light status can probably forego the early QTc assessment and wait until 48 hours and 96 hours for their on-drug QTc determination. If the on-therapy QTc is 500 ms or greater or the patient self-identified as a QTc reactor with a \u0394QTc of 60 ms or greater, then the QTc countermeasures need to be reexamined or the medications stopped in an effort to neutralize the increased potential for DI-TdP and DI-SCD (Figure 1).",

For example, if a patient\u2019s left bundle branch block has yielded a QRS complex of 200 ms and a QTc of 520 ms, this scenario would appear to activate the red light pathway (Figure 1). However, the wide QRS complex\u2013adjusted QTc would be 520 ms \u2013 (200 \u2212 100 ms) = 520 \u2212 100 = 420 ms, which is not red light status at all but rather \u201cgreen light go\u201d status with much QTc reassurance that the patient is at low risk for DI-SCD.",
