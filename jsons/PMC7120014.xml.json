As HIV-infected patients are living longer, noninfectious pulmonary diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent with a proportional decline in the incidence of opportunistic infections (OIs). Pulmonary OIs such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and tuberculosis are still responsible for a significant proportion of pulmonary diseases in HIV-infected patients. However, bacterial pneumonia (BP) and noninfectious pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) account for a growing number of pulmonary diseases in aging HIV-infected patients. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the spectrum and management of pulmonary diseases in aging HIV-infected patients, although limited data exists to guide management of many noninfectious pulmonary diseases in HIV-infected patients. In the absence of such data, treatment of lung diseases in HIV-infected patients should generally follow guidelines for management established in HIV-uninfected patients.",

Compared with the first therapies for HIV developed in the early 1990s, more recent combination ART is less toxic, easier to administer, and more effective. However, the ideal timing of ART initiation remains controversial. It has been well established that patients with CD4+ T-cell counts  <  200 cells/mm3 \u00adbenefit from ART. More recent recommendations suggest that HIV-infected patients benefit from ART initiation when CD4+ T-cell counts are less than 350 cells/mm3. Furthermore, untreated viremia in asymptomatic patients with CD4+ T-cell  >  350 cells/mm3 has been associated with progression of non-AIDS-related comorbid medical conditions such as cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases [14\u201316]. In response these findings, some experts advocate for ART \u00adinitiation even when CD4+ T-cell counts are greater than 350 cells/mm [3, 17]. However, the timing of ART initiation requires goals specifically tailored to the individual patient.",

Older HIV-infected patients started on ART have faster viral suppression, potentially related to improved adherence compared with younger HIV-infected patients [18, 19]. Yet, despite better adherence and at least comparable if not superior viral suppression, older HIV-infected patients who initiate ART still have lower on-treatment CD4+ T-cell counts, delayed improvement in CD4+ T-cell counts, shorter time to development of AIDS, and higher mortality [18\u201327]. One study showed that despite fewer AIDS-defining OIs in older patients (22% vs. 31% in younger patients, p  <  0.01) and more rapid viral suppression, mortality was still significantly higher in older HIV-infected patients (37% vs. 27% in younger patients, p  =  0.04) [18].",

The immune system of HIV-infected patients has been compared to that of HIV-uninfected patients 20\u201330 years older [3, 27\u201331]. HIV progression is strongly influenced by age at seroconversion and the time since seroconversion [1, 20, 32\u201338].

HIV-infected persons experience a gradual but persistent loss of host immunity following infection that results in a syndrome of immune deregulation, dysfunction, and deficiency. One of the earliest immunologic impairments seen in HIV infection, similar to aging, is depletion of gut-associated lymphoid tissue, predominantly due to loss of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes of the effector memory type [39]. During the chronic phase of HIV infection, generalized immune activation occurs and ultimately, progressive decline in the na\u00efve and memory T-cell pool results in systemic CD4+ T-cell lymphocyte depletion [39, 40]. Aging, likewise, results in a decline in CD4+ T-cell counts [3, 41, 42]. Decreased na\u00efve T-cell reserve and thymic involution that occur in HIV-infected patients mirror changes associated with physiologic aging in an HIV-uninfected population [22, 25, 27, 43].",

B-cell dysfunction can result in polyclonal activation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and lack of specific antibody responses. T-cell dysfunction can result in abnormal host responses to T-cell-dependent antigens. T-cells may also be abnormally activated in a resting state, and cytotoxic T-cell expansion and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon gamma can occur [3, 44, 45]. In both HIV and physiologic aging, there is evidence of T-cell senescence, the hallmarks of which include decreased expression of costimulatory receptors, shortened telomeres, impaired replication, and excessive cytokine production [3].

In a study comparing methacholine challenge between 66 HIV-infected patients with eight matched control subjects, Wallace et al. found no increased prevalence of AHR in HIV-infected patients [84]. While AHR was present, there was no independent association with HIV. Similar to HIV-uninfected patients, HIV-infected patients with AHR were more likely to have a history of asthma, recent history of pneumonia or report dyspnea or wheezing during their clinic visit [84]. However, another cross-sectional study comparing 248 HIV-infected men to 236 HIV-uninfected men found that AHR was more common in HIV-infected patients (26.2% HIV-infected patients vs. 14.4% HIV-uninfected patients), especially among HIV-infected smokers [83]. T-cell dysfunction, in the setting of HIV and cigarette smoking, may contribute to occult airway disease and AHR in HIV-infected patients. However, there is no data linking age and increased risk of AHR in HIV-infected patients.",

In addition, HIV-infected patients appear to be at risk of developing comorbid diseases earlier than HIV-uninfected patients resulting in earlier symptomatology and greater morbidity as they age. Many pulmonary diseases are more common in HIV-infected patients compared with HIV-uninfected patients, and HIV is independently associated with a risk for a number of infectious and noninfectious pulmonary diseases after adjusting for the presence of smoking and other risk factors [13]. The incidence of most of these pulmonary diseases increases with age, regardless of HIV status [13]. A recent study found that physical function may be worse in older HIV-infected patients with chronic pulmonary disease compared with similar HIV-uninfected patients with chronic pulmonary disease, although severity of underlying chronic pulmonary disease was not assessed with pulmonary function tests in this study [85].",

While smoking is one of the strongest risk factors for COPD, it does not seem to fully account for the increased risk of COPD in HIV infection. Gingo et al. found that while patients with any smoking history had more DLCO impairments than those who never smoked, nearly 50% of never-smokers still had significantly abnormal DLCO on PFTs which may correspond to emphysematous changes on chest CT [81].",

Colonization with Pneumocystis has been proposed to play a role in the progressive decline of pulmonary function in HIV-infected patients [92\u201394]. In nonhuman primate models, low levels of Pneumocystis result in inflammatory changes in the lung with resultant emphysematous changes [92, 93]. In human subjects found to be colonized with Pneumocystis, systemic inflammatory mediators are elevated which may contribute to development of COPD and airway diseases [94]. In HIV-uninfected patients, latent viral infections have also been implicated in exacerbations of COPD [95]. HIV virus has been identified in the lung epithelial cells of HIV-infected patients and may act similarly to other viruses in contributing to COPD development and exacerbation [96].",

In fact, HIV-infected smokers with emphysema have higher proportions of cytotoxic lymphocytes in BAL fluid [90]. Increased enzyme production by alveolar macrophages in HIV-infected patients may play a role in the development of COPD as well. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to destruction of the lung parenchymal architecture resulting in emphysema. MMP production by activated alveolar macrophages may be up-regulated in HIV-infected patients leading to advanced emphysema [98].

The use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids requires careful monitoring, as inhaled corticosteroids are associated with increased risk of oral candidiasis, bacterial pneumonia [101], and tuberculosis [102]. Regular use of systemic steroids should be avoided. In addition, drug interactions can result in significant medication toxicities. For example, ritonovir, a commonly prescribed protease inhibitor, suppresses the hepatic cytochrome p450 3A4 system (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 is responsible for degrading inhaled corticosteroids, particularly fluticasone [103]. Concurrent use of ritonovir and nasal or inhaled corticosteroids could result in increased levels of circulating exogenous corticosteroid. Elevated serum corticosteroid levels may result in inhibition of the hypothalamus\u2013pituitary axis. Cushing syndrome and adrenal insufficiency have been reported in HIV-infected patients taking ritonovir and fluticasone [104\u2013106]. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal pulmonary regimen for HIV-infected patients with COPD.",

In studies of HIV-uninfected patients with COPD, physical functioning is significantly improved with participation in pulmonary rehabilitation programs [109].

Studies conducted since the introduction of combination ART have not found similar results with TMP-SMX but did find a protective effect of ART, specifically protease inhibitors, with respect to a decreased risk of BP [113]. Despite these decreases in rates of BP, even with successful ART, the risk of BP remains elevated for HIV-infected patients compared with HIV-uninfected patients [13, 116].

For patients with severe CAP and a penicillin allergy, aztreonam should be substituted for the beta-lactam.

Systemically, treatment with ART decreases HIV replication, immune activation, chronic inflammation and increases CD4+ T-cell lymphocyte counts. Within the alveolar space, ART similarly decreases pulmonary HIV viral load and decreases nonspecific pulmonary inflammatory response [168, 169]. Infectious complications such as BP and PCP are less frequent among those on ART [13, 73, 112, 113, 115, 118, 123]. In an earlier study, the initiation of lamivudine was associated with improved dyspnea [69]. With less frequent and less severe infectious complications, risk of ILD \u2013 and other chronic lung diseases \u2013 may also be reduced with ART use. Indeed, a cohort study of 33,420 HIV-infected Veterans found that incident pulmonary disease was lower in patient already on ART at study enrollment [13].",

Progression of diseases such as COPD may significantly affect quality of life for HIV-infected patients. Cigarette smoking is a major contributor to pulmonary morbidity and mortality in the current ART era. In addition, recurrent respiratory tract infections are likely to contribute to pulmonary impairment in this population. It is important to identify mechanisms to preserve lung function and quality of life among HIV-infected patients. Between the shift of HIV to a chronic disease, the high prevalence of smoking and strong association between aging, smoking, and lung disease, future efforts need to focus on effective smoking cessation strategies specifically geared towards HIV-infected patients [170]. In addition to smoking cessation, safe and effective treatment of pulmonary diseases such as COPD, lung cancer, and PAH in aging HIV-infected patients on ART needs to be established. The role of ART in the development of pulmonary diseases must also be further investigated. Finally, as HIV-infected patients progress in age, the role of screening for chronic lung diseases such as COPD and lung cancer needs to be addressed.",
