There is currently no indication that feline-or canine-to-human transmission can occur, though there is rising evidence of the reverse. To explore the extent of animal-related transmission, we aggregated 17 case reports on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals as of 15 May 2020. All but two animals fully recovered and had only mild respiratory or digestive symptoms. Using data from probable cat-to-cat transmission in Wuhan, China, we estimated the basic reproduction number R0 under this scenario at 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.13). This value is much lower than the R0 reported for humans and close to one, indicating that the sustained transmission between cats is unlikely to occur. Our results support the view that the pet owners and other persons with COVID-19 in close contact with animals should be cautious of the way they interact with them.",

Some positive samples were from cats cared for by human COVID-19 cases or cats at a pet hospital, but samples from stray cats with no known link to human COVID-19 cases were also positive, indicating the possibility of sustained feline-to-feline transmission among stray cats.",

Three of the farms were epidemiologically linked to each other, but the fourth farm had no connection with the previous outbreaks. Two more infected farms were reported in early May. Although human-to-mink transmission is considered the probable source of the outbreaks, transmission between minks was indicated as the main driver [7] . In contrast to infected domestic dogs and cats, which are typically asymptomatic or have only a mild course of disease following infection, some infected minks suffered from a more severe course involving pneumonia and death [7] .",

In the experiments of [8] , the authors inoculated infected animals with high viral loads. However, the majority of serological samples collected from stray and domestic cats showed a relatively weak viral titer [6] . Similarly, the viral titers of an infected dog in Hong Kong were also weak, and the dog was never considered contagious to other dogs or to humans [10] . In light of this information, rampant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among stray cats in Wuhan seems unlikely. However, if sustained transmission among domesticated animals is possible, SARS-CoV-2 may pose a substantial threat to the animal communities themselves. There is also a risk that these animals will act as a reservoir for the virus [11] .",

Some positive samples were from cats cared for by human COVID-19 cases or at a pet hospital, but stray cats with no known link to human COVID-19 cases tested positive as well. Following the modeling framework (1)-(2), we estimated the basic reproduction number ! at 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05, 1.13), which suggested the probability of major outbreak at around 7.9% (95% CI: 4.7%, 12.1%). Given this low probability, the likelihood that sustained transmission among domestic and stray cats occurred in Wuhan, China is low.",

However, in other countries only symptomatic pets are likely to be detected typically no testing is done unless the animals are symptomatic. In line with this logic, all three cases in Hong Kong did not show any specific symptoms of COVID-19, while cases reported elsewhere exhibited respiratory or digestive symptoms. The observed difference in severity of disease for the animals may additionally be explained by the difference in prevalence of the COVID-19 human cases-as of 15 May, Hong Kong reported just over one thousand cases, while the other countries with domestic animal cases reported >50,000 human cases.",

The government of Hong Kong reported that about 50 animals including 2 hamsters were tested as of 17 April 2020, however, the count of confirmed cases remained the same compared to the earlier numbers [14] . A recent preprint [15] reported absence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among 9 cats and 12 dogs whose owners-veterinary students from the 20-year-old age group-formed a cluster of COVID-19 cases in France. Among 18 infected individuals, 2 were confirmed with PCR testing, 9 were presumptive cases, and 7 were asymptomatic [15] . On one hand, this may suggest that there was a lower infectiousness of 20-yearold individuals compared to pet owners with a more heterogenous age profile. On the other hand, the presence of asymptomatic human carriers could also play a role as some studies have shown highlighted the lack of secondary infections in households with asymptomatic index cases [16, 17] .",

Transmission between animals and from animals to humans in the affected areas was only speculated [20] . In contrast, animals can be infected, even lethally, with seasonal influenza virus transmitted from their owner [21] .

However, our results are subject to a few limitations. First, the data shared by [6] do not allow us to distinguish the negative serological tests of domestic cats from those of stray cats. We therefore assumed domestic cats to be part of the chain of transmission among all cats. We also assumed that stray cats were unlikely to be in close contact with humans. However, some stray cats could be fed by humans and there is a chance that the virus could be transmitted by an infected human to a stray cat by a contaminated feeder or other fomite. Second, we assumed that interventions implemented by the Chinese government to halt the epidemic in Wuhan in February-March 2020 did not affect the transmission dynamics of the virus among cats. Third, our calculation of the probability of a major outbreak-estimated at 7.9%-relied on the assumption of a homogeneous contact pattern between stray and domestic cats and imposed an exponentially distributed infectious period. The use of a heterogeneous contact pattern and (for example) a gamma distribution for the infectious period would provide more precise results [24] [25] [26] , however incorporation of these factors requires more detailed data on the serological tests and the cat population in Wuhan than was available in the preprint by Zhang et al.",

There is no clear evidence that the virus is more than minimally transmissible to and among domestic animals, and the sporadic detections that are found are most likely to be only weakly positive. Therefore, most infections in domestic cats and dogs likely came directly from infected humans. At the same time, scientific evidence continues to indicate that the probability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from domestic animals to humans is extremely low.",
