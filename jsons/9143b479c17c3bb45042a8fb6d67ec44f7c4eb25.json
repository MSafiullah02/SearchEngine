The most common symptoms are fever and dry cough; a minority of patients report other symptoms such as headache, sore throat, and sneeze [1, 2] . COVID-19 has rapidly spread from Wuhan, throughout China and into other countries. The virus-specific nucleic acid sequences have been detected in lung fluid, throat, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab samples [3] . Due to lack of sufficient awareness of the COVID-19 in the early stages of the epidemic, some healthcare workers (HCWs) have been infected [4, 5] . Patients with symptoms of COVID-19 may present to ear, nose, and throat (ENT) departments. Moreover diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in ENT departments involve direct contact with patients' upper respiratory tract mucosa, and/or induce patients to cough or sneeze. Thus there is an especially high risk to HCWs and other patients in ENT departments.",

During nasal endoscopy, care was taken to ensure adequate surface anaesthesia to reduce the sneeze reflex. On the ward, temperature monitoring was conducted at the entrance for all persons, an epidemiological history was taken from all patients and caregivers, and everyone on the ward was required to wear a surgical mask. Vital signs were monitored every 4 h for patients, and temperatures were taken twice daily from caregivers. In order to reduce the crowding of the ward, visiting was restricted to a single visitor. An emergency isolation ward was established to manage suspected patients.",

Emergency patients are assessed and managed according to the flowchart in Figure 1 . After surgery, patients with suspected COVID-19 are transferred to a negative pressure isolation ward and screened for COVID-19. Those who screen negative are returned to the ENT department; those who test positive are transferred to the infectious ward for further treatment. It should be emphasized that fever occurred in only 43.8% of patients with 2019-nCoV on initial presentation; those patients may be missed if the surveillance case definition only focused on fever detection during preoperative screening [6] . Thus, computed tomography is required preoperatively on elective surgical patients, along with virological testing for COVID-19 in suspected patients [6] .",
