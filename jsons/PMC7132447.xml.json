Typically, infection control departments were managed by nurses or junior physicians, who were viewed as \u2018outside\u2019 the more powerful spheres of senior physicians and hospital management. Despite the participants' acknowledgement of the importance of having links to senior management, in many hospitals infection control directors did not report organisationally to hospital administration. Like hospital staff interviewed, several government officials also stated that infection control staff needed to have the authority to monitor and then follow up on problems with other staff in order to be effective. Without adequate senior level commitment to these goals, infection control functions were unlikely to be able to make any substantial improvements in practices. As one city quality control association representative said:Infection control personnel do not have power to enforce infection control guidelines: no funding, no administrative power, and no financial budgeting power.\n",

First, surveillance focused on outcomes such as infection rates and bacteria counts, rather than on the process of proper hand hygiene. Some participants noted that data on adherence to recommended hand hygiene processes which were known to improve outcomes (reduced HCAIs) would provide concrete targets for improvement. However, participants also said that monitoring of hand hygiene practices was not done routinely in any hospital. The focus was on bacterial counts on sampled hands of workers. Second, data were rarely actionable as they were produced from random checks and reported in unidentified ways months after the measurement. Subsequently, while the data could show trends in infection rates at the hospital, they were too generalised to foster quality improvement efforts on particular patient care units. As a Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) representative commented:The surveillance system is primordial. The outcomes are not very sensitive to result-based surveillance of disinfection agents and sample of hands. It is more useful to get results from process-based surveillance, but it is difficult to implement in hospitals.\n",
