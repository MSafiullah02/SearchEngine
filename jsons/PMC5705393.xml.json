Because viral fusion is one of the first required steps of an enveloped virus infection, preventing it constitutes an attractive approach for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Viral membrane fusion also serves as a model for studying biological membrane fusion systems because of its relative simplicity. Compared to the more complex cellular synaptic vesicle membrane fusion system, which involves several proteins, only one type of glycoprotein, the viral fusion protein, is involved in the viral fusion process. For this reason, study of viral membrane fusion allows a focus on protein\u2013lipid interactions and on biophysical aspects of the lipid bilayer during this process.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a diverse group of enveloped viruses that infect humans and animals, with several recent examples of zoonotic transmission, including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and more recently Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Entry of CoVs into host cells is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein, which mediates both receptor binding (via the S1 domain) and membrane fusion (via the S2 domain). The S protein is categorized as a class I viral fusion protein, which includes the prototype envelope glycoprotein influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and the HIV envelope protein. However, the CoV S differs in several aspects from prototypical class I viral fusion proteins. While influenza virus and HIV envelope proteins are known to be activated via cleavage by host cell proteases, this occurs at a single, restricted site directly adjacent to the fusion peptide (FP). In contrast, CoVs typically have two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by a much wider range of proteases, with the FP function being able to be modulated by changes in the cleavage site position relative to the FP. This gives CoVs unique flexibility in the ability to invade new cell types, tissues, and host species. Several segments located in proximity with the heptad repeats (HR) region and transmembrane domain of the S2 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein have been proposed and characterized as putative CoV FPs [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. The main objective of this work is to identify and characterize the bona fide CoV FP based on structural and functional analyses of peptide\u2013lipid membrane interactions, using SARS-CoV S as a prototype. We have chosen SARS-CoV S as a model since most functional data are available with this virus. However, the FP is highly conserved across the very diverse CoV family, and so our findings would be directly applicable to all CoVs, including MERS-CoV as well as any novel viruses that are yet to emerge from their animal reservoir.",

However, identification of viral FPs is often difficult. While there are no universal definitions, FPs are generally fusion protein domains that insert into host membranes after proteolytic cleavage exposure and major conformational changes of the envelope glycoprotein, thus facilitating the initialization stage of membrane fusion. The flanking region of some FPs can also interact with membranes and have been shown to play an important role in the later stages of membrane fusion. Whether those flanking regions can be classified as FPs is still disputed. Also, the exact size of FPs is a matter of debate. For example, the length of the influenza FP is estimated to be 20 or 23 amino acids (aa), depending on the group that has characterized it [8], [9], [10].",

            "text": "The identification of the location of the FP for the CoV S protein is particularly challenging because of the large size of the fusion protein and the presence of multiple cleavage sites. For SARS-CoV S, the S1/S2 cleavage site is located at residue R667 (R: arginine), and the S2\u2032 site is found at the R797 position [11]. Within the S2 fusion domain of SARS-CoV S protein, several regions have been proposed as FPs. These have been proposed based mainly on their hydrophobic amino acid content, and without functional experimental back-up. Using Wimley and White interfacial hydrophobicity analysis and peptide library scanning approaches, it has been suggested that the sequence corresponding to residues 770\u2013788, located upstream of the S2\u2032 cleavage site, is a putative FP (AltFP1) and that the sequence composed of residues 873\u2013888, found upstream of the HR1 heptad repeat region, forms an \u201cinternal\u201d FP (IFP or AltFP2) [3], [4], [7]. In addition, a region located proximal to the transmembrane region, the pre-transmembrane region or PTM (aa 1185\u20131202) was also found to have membrane-interacting properties [3], [4]. It has been suggested that these segments within S2 work in concert to mediate the different steps of membrane fusion [4]. Most recently, these alternate protein segments have been subjected to structural characterization by NMR [and in some cases by electron spin resonance (ESR) and differential scanning calorimetry] [12], [13]. The \u201cFP\u201d and \u201cIFP\u201d regions as defined by Mahajan and Bhattacharya have an uncertain functional role. Importantly, they show only limited sequence homology across the Coronaviridae, which would be very unusual for a viral FP. However, we have shown in previous functional experiments that the sequence immediately downstream of the S2\u2032 site (798\u2013815, FP1) is extremely well conserved among CoVs and possesses many features of a viral FP [14].",

These structural studies show that the CoV S regions corresponding to FP1 of SARS-CoV S are exposed at the surface of the corresponding S proteins. These structures have generally been interpreted such that FP1 is the viral FP. However, for all determined structures, the S protein is in its pre-fusion state and often have cleavage sites modified to promote protein stability of the recombinantly expressed protein. As such, there is currently limited information on the structural features of the CoV FP after proteolytic processing at S2\u2032 and when interacting with lipid bilayers.",

ESR spectroscopy is a powerful way to characterize FPs. We have successfully used ESR to study membrane structure modifications by insertion of various FPs, and consistently found that the FPs of HIV, influenza, and Dengue virus induce membrane ordering, that is, bilayer lipids becoming more ordered when the FP interacts with membranes [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. We also found as a control that non-fusogenic mutants of the respective FPs have a much reduced ordering effect on membranes [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Membrane ordering is critical for membrane fusion, as it reflects the dehydration effect, which removes the repulsive force between the opposing membranes and allows them to come into a proximal position before fusion can take place [23], [26]. Therefore, our approach provides a robust and reliable method to identify bona fide FPs. In this work, we have used this innovative approach to identify and characterize the CoV FP.",

In addition, our results show that FP1 and FP2 work cooperatively as a bipartite fusion \u201cplatform\u201d within an extended FP (FP1_2). In the presence of calcium ions, both FPs showed stronger membrane ordering, which is consistent with our observations that both FPs exhibit strong calcium dependencies for their membrane fusion function as assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Finally, our in vitro data are consistent with in vivo assays showing the dependence of calcium cations for SARS-CoV S-mediated virus entry and fusion. Together, our work provides a comprehensive analysis and strongly indicates that FP1_2 has the key characteristics of a bona fide FP, with unique properties.",

We have previously demonstrated that the SARS-CoV S region immediately downstream of the S2\u2032 cleavage site (SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGF, referred to as FP1 here) was highly conserved among CoVs [14]. Furthermore, we have also shown that a pair of highly conserved cysteines (C822\u2013C833) found downstream of FP1 is essential for the membrane fusion function along with core-associated residues D830 and L831 (the region downstream of FP1 and containing these residues is referred to as FP2 here) [5]. To validate these findings with more recent sequence information, we first performed a comprehensive protein sequence alignment analysis (Fig. 1a) of the extended region corresponding to the FP1_2 fusion domain of SARS-CoV. These results are summarized in the Weblogo generated using the sequence alignment data (Fig. 1b). The location of the FP1_2 segment in the context of a model structure of the SARS-CoV S protein monomer, which is based on MHV S structure, is highlighted in Fig. 1c. The analysis confirms and extends our earlier findings to all four characterized CoV genera with six invariant and eight highly conserved sites. Among the highly conserved and invariant sites is the LLF motif and the conserved cysteine pair previously found to be critical for membrane fusion by site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays [5], [14].",

Alanine substitutions in the LLF motif of FP1 were shown to be fusion defective in our previous study, and so a LLF\u2794AAA modified peptide was also generated [14]. Other peptides previously proposed to be CoV FPs were synthesized, including an \u201cN-terminal FP\u201d that is immediately downstream of the SARS-CoV S1/S2 cleavage site (770\u2013788, AltFP-A) and an internal FP (873\u2013888, IFP or AltFP-B), as well as a negative control peptide that corresponds to the region downstream of IFP within the HR1 region (887\u2013904, HRP). The synthesized FPs contain a C-terminal GGGKKKK hydrophilic tag sequence except HRP and FP1_2. The GGGKKKK tag sequence is used to increase the solubility of the peptides. This approach has been applied to other FPs previously and has been shown to have no effect on the function of FPs [24], [27], [28]. Here, in order to further demonstrate that it does not interfere with our ESR measurements on FP1, we synthesized a variant FP1 (pFP1) devoid of the C-terminal GGGKKKK tag. We also synthesized randomized sequence variants of FP1 and FP2 (rFP1 and rFP2, respectively), which have the same amino acid composition as FP1 and FP2 but with a shuffled arrangement of residues.",

PS is an anionic lipid that is found in the inner leaflet of the cytosolic membrane and to some extent in endosomal membranes [29]. It is critical for synaptic membrane fusion [30], [31], [32], and it also promotes viral entry of various viruses [33], [34]. A recent study showed that PS is critical for HIV entry [35]. Moreover, PS has been widely used in FP research [36], [37] and is also consistent with the system that we have used previously [14]. We used multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) in our ESR study as they can be much more concentrated than small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) and greatly enhance the ESR signal.

Three spin labels were used: dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-tempo-choline (DPPTC) has a tempo-choline headgroup and the spin is sensitive to changes of environment at the headgroup region; 5PC and 14PC have a doxyl group in the C5 or C14 position of the acyl chain, respectively (Fig. 1e), and they are sensitive to the changes of environment in the hydrophobic acyl chain region at different depths. Using the NLSL program based on the microscopic order macroscopic disorder model (MOMD) [38], [39], the order parameter of the spin can be extracted, which is correlated with the order of the membrane. Thus, the effect of peptide binding on the structure of the membrane can be monitored. These three spin-labeled lipids have been used in previous studies and their ability to detect changes in membrane structure has been validated [26], [40]. Our previous studies examined the effect of a various viral FPs, including those of influenza virus [21], [23], HIV [24], and Dengue virus [25], as well as the FP of the ancestral eukaryotic gamete fusion protein HAP2 [25].

The resulting S\n0 from the spectra shows that pFP1 has a very similar membrane-ordering effect profile to FP1 (Fig. 2d and e). Thus, the GGGKKKK sequence does not appear to interfere with the membrane ordering induced by FP1. Control experiments with the GGGKKKK hydrophilic tag alone show that it cannot induce membrane ordering (data not shown).

Here, the reason we used SUVs instead of MLVs is that MLVs are too big for CD spectroscopy, which would cause scattering and a noisy signal. The CD spectra of FP1 at pH 5 are similar to those observed for the pH 7 condition (not shown). In contrast, the fusion defective variant FP1_AAA exhibits a mostly random-coil structure in both solutions with or without the presence of SUVs.

Thus, the activity of FP2 is dependent on the formation of the internal disulfide bond. From CD spectroscopy analysis, we found that the presence of 5 mM DTT significantly changes the secondary structure of FP2 in SUVs, as the spectrum of FP2 in the presence of SUVs and DTT is similar to the spectrum of FP2 in solution (Fig. 3d).

As shown in Fig. 4\n, although both AltFP-A and AltFP-B increase membrane order of DPPTC and 5PC spin-labeled lipids, the effect is smaller than those seen for FP1 in two ways. First, the maximum changes of S\n0 of both DPPTC and 5PC for AltFP-A (0.012 and 0.036, respectively) and AltFP-B (0.019 and 0.027, respectively) are smaller than those for FP1 (0.033 and 0.051, respectively). Second, when we fitted the S\n0-P/L ratio curve with a sigmoidal curve, the concentration of peptide that induces half of the maximal \u0394S\n0 could be determined. For FP1, these concentrations for DPPTC and 5PC are 0.39% and 0.22%, respectively, which are significantly lower than those for AltFP-A (0.77% and 0.52%, respectively) and AltFP-B (0.75% and 0.58%, respectively). The results indicate that FP1 has a significantly higher activity than the other two peptides. Interestingly, we could not observe the change of S\n0 of 14PC (not shown) for all peptides, although Basso et al. showed that the S\n0 of 16PC was affected by both AltFP-A and AltFP-B in their 100% charged membranes. FPs of influenza virus and HIV insert into the membranes in a shallow manner, with no effect on 14PC spin-labeled lipids [21], [24]. Our results with the SARS-CoV FP1 show that it has a consistently higher membrane-ordering activity than AltFP-A and AltFP-B, suggesting that FP1 is more likely a bona fide FP.

We compared the order parameter S\n0 of samples in the presence of 1 mM EGTA, without EGTA or Ca2 +, and in the presence of 1 mM Ca2 +. Analysis of these different conditions shows that trace Ca2 + ions increase membrane order of the headgroup (DPPTC) noticeably but have no effects on acyl chains (5PC and 14PC, data not shown). This is likely because Ca2 + cannot penetrate into the hydrophobic layer of the membranes.",

The increase in S\n0 has two sources, the FPs and the Ca2 +; thus, we generated a \u0394S\n0-Ca2 + concentration plot, where \u0394S\n0\n = \nS\n0 (membrane with 1% FP) \u2212 \nS\n0 (membrane without FP) at each Ca2 + concentration.

During titration, a total of 300 \u03bcL 2 mM CaCl2 in a pH 5 buffer (with 10 \u03bcL solution in each injection) was injected into a reaction cell containing 1 mL of FPs at 0.4 mM. The background caused by the dilution of CaCl2 has been subtracted by using data from a control experiment that titrated CaCl2 in a pH 5 buffer. Substantial heat absorbed during the titration was observed, with the heat absorbed saturating toward the end of the titration. As shown in Fig. 5b and Table 1B, when the heat versus molar ratio plot was fitted using a one-site model that assumes that all binding sites have the same binding affinity, we calculated the enthalpy change \u0394H\n = 4.67 kcal/mol, with binding constant K\nb\n = 3.76 \u00d7 104\n M\u2212 1 and stoichiometry n\n = 0.92. From these parameters, we further calculated the free energy change \u0394G\n = \u2212 RTlnK\nb\n = 6.49 kcal/mol and \u2212 T\u0394S\n = \u0394G\n \u2212 \u0394H\n = \u2212 1.80 kcal/mol. The data show that the calcium\u2013FP1 interaction is endothermic, and the binding ratio is one calcium per peptide. The reason for the endothermic reaction could be because the buffer solution (150 mM NaCl) contains significant amounts of Na+ ions that could also interact with FP1 and that a stronger binding of Ca2 + cations displaces bound Na+ into the bulk solution. To test this hypothesis, we reduced the NaCl concentration to 50 mM and performed an ITC titration. However, the baselines of the titration curves we obtained were unstable, and we could not extract meaningful data. The reason for this result is unclear, but it is possible that the peptide requires a certain level of salt concentration to maintain its structure. We performed the same experiment with FP2 and FP1_2 (Fig. 5c and d). As shown in Fig. 5c and Table 1B, like FP1, FP2 also exhibits an endothermic reaction with Ca2 +, with a stoichiometry of n\n = 1.02, \u0394H\n = 5.94 kcal/mol, and K\nb\n = 2.34 \u00d7 104\n M\u2212 1. Furthermore, in the case of FP1_2, the stoichiometry is n\n = 1.70. The ITC experiments we conducted demonstrate strong evidence for direct calcium\u2013FP interactions, with one Ca2 + cation binding per FP1 or FP2.",

We generated murine leukemia virus pseudotyped viruses harboring full-length SARS-CoV S envelope glycoproteins and containing the luciferase reporter gene. These viral particles are pertinent surrogates of native enveloped viruses, as they recapitulate all entry steps governed by the heterologous (SARS-CoV S) fusion protein and allow for a quantitative measurement of infectivity thanks to the luciferase reporter expressed only in an infected cell [47]. We first performed an extracellular calcium ion depletion experiment in which Vero-E6 cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with or without calcium ions, incubated with culture medium with or without calcium ions, and infected with pseudovirions in the presence or absence of the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Fig. 6a). This assay shows that depletion of extracellular calcium cations significantly decreases SARS-CoV pseudotyped particle (SARSpp) infectivity, with a measured ~ 2.9-fold decrease. As SARS-CoV is known to enter cells through the endocytic pathway, we then tested the effect of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (BAPTA-AM), a calcium-specific cell membrane-permeable chelator, to investigate the role of intracellular calcium on SARS-CoV virus entry (Fig. 6b and c). We first assessed the effect of BAPTA-AM on cell viability (Fig. 6b). Increasing concentrations of BAPTA-AM were incubated with Vero-E6 cells, which were then analyzed for cell viability using luminescence-based ATP quantitation assay. This analysis shows that cell viability is not significantly impacted up to the highest concentration tested of 50 \u03bcM. Upon depletion of intracellular calcium ions in Vero-E6 cells using a similar 50 \u03bcM BAPTA-AM treatment to that mentioned above, we observed a remarkable ~ 60-fold decrease in SARSpp infectivity (Fig. 6c). Taken together, our functional assays strongly support an important functional role played by Ca2 + ions during viral fusion and entry of SARS-CoV.",

These findings indicated that two peptide segments work cooperatively to enhance membrane ordering. We examined the possible cooperative effects of FP1 and FP2 when they are present together with lipid bilayers. We mixed FP1 and FP2 at a 1:1 molar ratio before they were allowed to bind to the membranes. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, binding of the mixture of FP1 and FP2 at 1:1 ratio (Mix. of FP1 + FP2) was accompanied by a membrane ordering of DPPTC and 5PC at pH 5. When the same amounts of total peptide were compared, the mixture of FP1 + FP2 increases S\n0 of DPPTC to 0.47 when the total P/L is 2% (i.e., 1% FP1 and 1% FP2), which is higher than the S\n0 for the 2% FP1 or 2% FP2 individual conditions. Also, the 5PC membrane ordering increases for the mixture of FP1 + FP2 are more noticeable, up to 0.61 at 2% total P/L ratio. Interestingly, although the mixture of FP1 + FP2 has no effect on 14PC, it has a small but observable membrane-ordering effect on 10PC (from 0.32 to 0.34; Fig. 7c), which cannot be observed with FP1 or FP2 individually. Thus, the cooperativity of FP1 and FP2 not only allows for a greater membrane-ordering effect than the addition of FP1 or FP2 individually, but also enables a deeper reach within the lipid bilayer.",

This observed membrane-ordering activity is correlated with the function of the FP, as the inactive LLF\u2794AAA mutant does not have such an effect. The membrane-ordering activity also depends on the correct amino acid sequence, because rFP1, which has the same residue composition as FP1 but in random order, does not induce membrane ordering. Correct folding of the peptide in the membrane is also an important parameter, as the LLF\u2794AAA mutant does not fold in the same way in the membrane as the FP1, as shown by CD spectroscopy and ITC. This finding is consistent with our previous studies on other viral FPs [21], [24], [25]. We further compared FP1's membrane ordering ability with those of two other proposed FPs AltFP-A and AltFP-B, and found that it has a higher activity than the other two. Our previous functional experiments on the SARS-CoV S protein suggest that FP1 possesses many features of an FP [14], and the recently published cryo-electron microscopy structures of the different CoV S proteins, including that of SARS-CoV S, suggest that in its pre-fusion state, FP1 appears to be exposed at the surface of the glycoprotein's S2 domain [15], [19], [20]. Taken together, these data indicate that FP1 is more likely a bona fide FP for the SARS-CoV S protein.",

The FP2 membrane-ordering activity is also dependent on correct folding, which is maintained by an internal disulfide bond, as addition of the reducing agent DTT eliminated membrane-ordering activity. FP2 is important because the membrane-ordering activity is significantly enhanced when FP1 and FP2 function cooperatively. Together, they induce a greater ordering effect than FP1 and FP2 separately, and exhibit a deeper reach into the membrane. Since FP2 is immediately downstream of FP1, we now propose that FP1 and FP2 can be considered as two domains of an extended, bipartite FP (FP1_2). Comparatively, such an extended FP, consisting of 41 residues, is about twice the size of the influenza or HIV FPs (~ 20 residues). Both FP1 and FP2 possess membrane-ordering activity, and the extended FP (FP1_2) has only slightly higher membrane-ordering activity than that of individual FPs added together (FP1 + FP2). These observations suggest that while they function cooperatively, the FP1 and FP2 are structurally quite independent. Therefore, it may be appropriate to regard them as two subdomains of a bipartite \u201cfusion platform.\u201d",

Our functional analyses using pseudotyped particles harboring full-length SARS-CoV S proteins show that the depletion of either extracellular or intracellular calcium significantly decreases SARS-CoV pseudovirion infectivity, indicating that S protein function is calcium dependent. Biophysical measurements performed in this work showed that the membrane-ordering activities of both FP1 and FP2 are only slightly affected by pH but are heavily dependent on calcium cations. We showed that the addition of EGTA eliminated the observed membrane-ordering effect. Furthermore, higher calcium concentrations were shown to enhance the membrane-ordering effect induced by both FP1 and FP2. The cooperativity of FP1 and FP2 is also calcium dependent. The ITC experiments on calcium\u2013FP interactions not only demonstrated the interaction energy between calcium and both FP1 and FP2, but also showed that the stoichiometries are around 1 calcium cation per FP1 or FP2. Although the thermodynamics of the calcium interactions with FPs needs to be further investigated, our current data indicate a calcium dependency for S protein-induced membrane fusion, a dependency that stems from calcium\u2013FP interactions.",

Because of their positive charges, they possess a generally enhancing or indirect effect on membrane fusion by electrostatic interactions with negatively charged headgroups of lipid bilayers, and thus decrease the electrostatic repulsion of two opposing membranes that are in close proximity prior to undergoing fusion. Calcium ions can also directly interact with fusion protein machineries, thereby activating their fusogenicity, and in such cases, membrane fusion is clearly calcium dependent. For example, in cellular SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion, calcium ions have been shown to be required activators for such fusion machinery [48], [49], [50]; that is, without calcium ions present, membrane fusion does not take place. Thus, SNARE-mediated synaptic membrane fusion is considered to be calcium dependent whereby calcium ions are fusion activators. There are other situations in which calcium cations have been shown to interact with protein fusogens and enhance their fusogenicity, but without calcium, membrane fusion can still occur albeit at a reduced rate. In such cases, membrane fusion is only partly dependent on calcium ions.",

In this study, we show that although calcium ions increase membrane-ordering effects in the influenza FP\u2013membrane system, the increase mostly results from indirect effects of calcium ions by interacting with lipid headgroups and not through a direct interaction with the influenza FP, as demonstrated by the lack of variation of \u0394S\n0 values when calcium concentration increases (Fig. 5a). In such a case, calcium plays an indirect enhancing effect on membrane fusion. With HIV, calcium cations also enhance fusion, but such ions are not required, as HIV FP-mediated membrane fusion can still occur at a lower rate in the absence of calcium cations [51]. In contrast, for the Rubella virus, which belongs to the Togaviridae family of viruses and possesses a class II viral fusion protein containing two fusion loops, it has been shown that the E1 envelope glycoprotein specifically coordinates and requires a Ca2 + ion for low-pH-induced membrane insertion into liposomes [52].",

We also show that the cooperative effect between FP1 and FP2 only occurs in the presence of calcium ions. Importantly, the interaction between calcium cations and FPs has been demonstrated by ITC. Finally, the intracellular calcium ion chelator BAPTA-AM was shown to abrogate viral entry in the in vivo assays we performed.

It is possible that within each subdomain, calcium ion coordination may allow the CoV FP to adopt a more compact conformation (Fig. 8).

The fitting strategy is described below. We employed the Budil et al. NLLS fitting program [39] to obtain convergence to optimum parameters. The g-tensor and A-tensor parameters used in the simulations were determined from rigid limit spectra [21]. In the simulation, we required a good fit with a small value of \u03c7\n2 and also good agreement between the details of the final simulation and the experimental spectrum. Each experiment (and subsequent fit) was repeated 2 or 3 times to check reproducibility and estimate experimental uncertainty. Two sets of parameters that characterize the rotational diffusion of the nitroxide radical moiety in spin labels were generated. The first set is the rotational diffusion constants. R\n\u22a5 and R\n|| are, respectively, the rates of rotation of the nitroxide moiety around a molecular axis perpendicular and parallel to the preferential orienting axis of the acyl chain. The second set consists of the ordering tensor parameters, S\n0 and S\n2, which are defined as follows: S\n0\n = < D\n2,00\n > = < 1/2(3cos2\u03b8\n \u2212 1)>, and S\n2\n = < D\n2,02\n + D2,0\u20132\n > = < \u221a(3/2)sin2\u03b8cos2\u03c6\n >, where D\n2,00, D\n2,02, and D\n2,0\u20132 are the Wigner rotation matrix elements and \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the polar and azimuthal angles for the orientation of the rotating axes of the nitroxide bonded to the lipid relative to the director of the bilayer, that is, the preferential orientation of lipid molecules; the angular brackets imply ensemble averaging. S\n0 and its uncertainty were then calculated in a well-known fashion from its definition and the dimensionless ordering potentials C\n20 and C\n22 and their uncertainties found in the fitting. The typical uncertainties we find for S\n0 range from 1 to 5 \u00d7 10\u2212 3, while the uncertainties from repeated experiments are 5\u20138 \u00d7 10\u2212 3 or less than \u00b1 0.01.
