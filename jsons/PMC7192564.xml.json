Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus in the same subgenus as the SARS virus, but in a different clade [2]. SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus, suggesting that bats are the primary source [3, 4]. Epidemiologic investigations of initial cases showed COVID-19 was linked with exposure to the Wuhan seafood market which also sold live rabbits, snakes, and other animals [5]. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission among close contacts has been the primary mechanism of transmission [6]. The disease has spread rapidly around the world, and more than 410,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported. COVID-19 outbreak has been reported in other countries, mainly among travelers from Wuhan and their contacts [7, 8]. WHO has declared this disease a pandemic.",

The principal presenting features of COVID-19 are fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging [10, 11]. Approximately 20% of patients progress to multi-organ dysfunction (including respiratory failure, septic shock, acute cardiac injury, or acute renal failure [10\u201312]. However, a complete picture of the clinical course of COVID-19 has not been described thoroughly [13]. Except for infection control and supportive therapy, there is no specific therapy of COVID-19. Multiple organ support therapy is the cornerstone in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 [12, 13]. Early recognition of risk factors for death would be useful to identify those potentially needing critical care at an early stage. Accordingly, a study was conducted to track the clinical course along the entire disease course. A risk factor analysis was performed to reveal important clinical features associated with poor outcomes.",

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition [16]. Cardiac injury was defined if the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin I) were above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit or if new abnormalities were shown in echocardiography.
