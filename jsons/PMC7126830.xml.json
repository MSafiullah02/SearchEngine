Especially in recent years, some emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) [2], avian influenza [3], [4], and swine influenza [5], have resulted in huge life and economical losses. Thus, analyzing and understanding the propagation of infectious diseases is of great significance to efficiently control potentially devastating epidemic outbreaks as well as to deploy tailored immunization strategies. Traditionally, there are two typical epidemic models: the Susceptible\u2013Infected\u2013Susceptible (SIS) and the Susceptible\u2013Infected\u2013Removed (SIR) models. Both kinds of models have been intensively studied during the last few years, adding to the traditional well-mixed hypotheses usually invoked by the models [6] an ever increasing dose of realism.",

Actually, the more abundant are those called scale-free (SF) networks, in which the probability P(k) that an individual has k neighbors is a power-law distribution [8], [9]. Today, the modeling of infectious diseases and their prevention and control has become an interdisciplinary issue which has attracted the attention of scientists from epidemiology, biology, mathematics, physics and computational sciences [10], [11], [12], [13]. In particular, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [14], [15] showed that the epidemic threshold \u03bbc in an SIS model is absent for SF networks in the thermodynamic limit, that is, the threshold \u03bbc approaches zero and even a vanishingly small infection rate can produce an outbreak. Similar conclusions were also found for the SIR model on SF networks by Moreno et al. [16]. These alarming results have inspired a great number of related works, and most results point out that the topology of interactions dominates the spreading dynamics in complex networks [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29].",

For instance, the issue of delayed recovery can be thought of as the time elapsed since an individual becomes infected and the moment he/she starts the treatment that could lead to recovery [37], [38]. This is especially relevant when studying spreading dynamics of diseases for which spontaneous recovery not due to medical treatment is unlikely. In what follows, we study the effects of such delayed recovery on the epidemic thresholds of an SIS dynamics that takes place on top of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Moreover, we also consider the case of nonuniform transmission (i.e., the fact that the spreading capabilities of an individual depend on his/her number of contacts) and the situation in which both mechanisms are concurrently active. To this end, we make use of the heterogeneous mean-field theory and perform large-scale numerical simulations, which we show are in agreement with the analytical predictions.",

            "text": "In homogeneous networks, the degree distribution is highly peaked around the average degree of the graph and the probability of finding a node with degree larger than the average degree \u3008k\u3009 decays exponentially fast as we move away from the peak. Making use of the mean-field approximation [14], [15], we can assume the connectivity of each node to be constant and equal to \u3008k\u3009. In this case, \u03bb(k) also becomes constant for all the nodes and reads as \u03bb(k)=\u03bb\u2032=\u03bb0\u3008k\u3009\u03b1\u3008k\u3009. Now, we can write the dynamical equations describing the system dynamics as: (2){\u2202s(t)\u2202t=\u2212\u03bb\u2032\u3008k\u3009s(t)\u03c1(t)+\u03c1T(t)\u2202\u03c10(t)\u2202t=\u2212\u03c10(t)+\u03bb\u2032\u3008k\u3009s(t)\u03c1(t)\u2202\u03c11(t)\u2202t=\u2212\u03c11(t)+\u03c10(t)...\u2202\u03c1T(t)\u2202t=\u2212\u03c1T(t)+\u03c1T\u22121(t) where s(t) is the fraction of susceptible individuals, \u03c10(t),\u2026,\u03c1T(t) denote the fraction of individuals in the states I0,\u2026,IT, respectively, and \u03c1(t)=\u22110T\u03c1j(t). The first equation in Eq. (2) represents the time evolution of susceptible individuals while the rest of the equations stand for the evolution of each of the T stages through which infected individuals pass until final recovery. In the first equation the negative term accounts for the new contagions and a positive term stands for recovered infected individuals. In the rest of Eq. (2) each negative term represents nodes passing to the next stage of the recovery time while the positive one includes the passage from the previous stage to the present one. If we insert the normalization condition s(t)+\u03c1(t)=1 into Eq. (2), we get (3)\u2202\u03c10(t)\u2202t=\u2212\u03c10(t)+\u03bb\u2032\u3008k\u3009[1\u2212\u03c1(t)]\u03c1(t). When t\u27f6\u221e, the system reaches a stationary state in which \u2202\u03c1\u03c4(t)\u2202t=0 for \u03c4=0,1,\u2026,T, and hence, (4)\u03c10=\u03c11=\u22ef=\u03c1T, where \u03c10,\u03c11,\u2026,\u03c1T and \u03c1 respectively denote the steady state values of \u03c10(t),\u03c11(t),\u2026,\u03c1T(t) and \u03c1(t). Finally, we have, (5)\u03c10=\u03c11=\u22ef=\u03c1T=\u03c1T+1. Combining Eqs. (2), (5), one obtains (6)\u2212\u03c1T+1+\u03bb\u2032\u3008k\u3009(1\u2212\u03c1)\u03c1=0. Obviously, \u03c1=0 is a trivial solution of Eq. (6), which corresponds to the disease-free state. To obtain a nontrivial solution 0<\u03c1<1 which would represent an endemic state, the following condition must be fulfilled, (7)dd\u03c1[\u03bb\u2032\u3008k\u3009(T+1)(\u03c1\u2212\u03c12)]|\u03c1=0>1. That is, (8)\u03bb\u2032\u3008k\u3009(T+1)>1. At variance with the standard formulation, we assume that the infectivity \u03bb\u2032 decreases with the number of neighbors of each individual (i.e., the degree k which is equal to the average degree of population \u3008k\u3009), verifying \u03bb\u2032=\u03bb0k\u03b1k in which 0\u2264\u03b1\u22641 and \u03bb0 is a degree-independent spreading rate. This expression, for the case of homogeneous networks, reduces to \u03bb\u2032=\u03bb0\u3008k\u3009\u03b1\u3008k\u3009 for all individuals. Thus, the critical threshold can be written as: (9)\u03bb0c=1(T+1)\u3008k\u3009\u03b1. Although Eq. (9) represents the general values of the epidemic threshold, some particular cases are worth further discussion: \u2022When the recovery delay is absent (i.e., T=0), the critical threshold is governed by the nonuniform transmission \u03bb0c=1\u3008k\u3009\u03b1. In particular, \u03b1=1 stands for the standard case where the critical spreading rate is equal to the inverse of the average degree of the network, for which we recover the classical result \u03bb0c=1\u3008k\u3009 [15].\u2022When \u03b1=0, if we introduce a rescaling factor A at the pre-factor of \u03bb\u2032 we get \u03bb\u2032=A\u03bbo\u3008k\u3009\u22121. In this case, the critical threshold reads as \u03bboc=1T+1\u22c51A, and therefore the threshold is independent of the network topology. This rescaling leads, in the particular case of T=0, to \u03bboc=1A\n[32].\n",

            "text": "For many natural, social and engineering systems, the degree distribution is highly skewed, that is, the topology is very heterogeneous and the average degree is not anymore a good proxy for the degree of each individual. In this case, nonuniform transmission effects are expected to be much more relevant in terms of their influence on the spreading dynamics, as the degree dependence of the spreading rate \u03bb(k)=\u03bb0k\u03b1k is explicitly incorporated. Hence, we should write differential equations for each class of degree k, which read as (10){\u2202sk(t)\u2202t=\u2212ksk(t)\u0398k(t)+\u03c1k,T(t)\u2202\u03c1k,0(t)\u2202t=\u2212\u03c1k,0(t)+ksk(t)\u0398k(t)\u2202\u03c1k,1(t)\u2202t=\u2212\u03c1k,1(t)+\u03c1k,0(t)...\u2202\u03c1k,T(t)\u2202t=\u2212\u03c1k,T(t)+\u03c1k,T\u22121(t) where \u03c1k,T(t) denotes the fraction of individuals with degree k in state IT at time t, and \u0398k(t) is the probability that a link points to an infected individual. The general expression for \u0398k(t) is, (11)\u0398k(t)=\u2211k\u2032\u03bb(k)P(k\u2032|k)\u03c1k\u2032(t) where \u03c1k\u2032(t) is the density of infected individuals with degree k\u2032 and the conditional probability P(k\u2032|k) denotes the probability that a node with degree k is connected to a node with degree k\u2032. We assume that networks are uncorrelated, and so \u0398k(t)=\u0398k\u2032(t)\u2261\u0398(t)\u2200(k,k\u2032), and P(k\u2032|k)=k\u2032P(k\u2032)/\u2211ssP(s), which gives: (12)\u0398(t)=\u2211k\u2032\u03bb(k\u2032)k\u2032P(k\u2032)\u03c1k\u2032(t)\u2211ssP(s)=\u2211k\u2032\u03bb(k\u2032)k\u2032P(k\u2032)\u03c1k\u2032(t)\u3008k\u3009. At the steady state, \u2202\u03c1k,\u03c4(t)\u2202t=0 for \u03c4=0,1,\u2026,T, and let \u03c1k(t)=\u2211\u03c4=0T\u03c1k,\u03c4(t) be the density of infected individuals with degree k, with the steady state values of \u03c1k(t), \u03c1k,0(t),\u2026,\u03c1k,T(t) labeled as \u03c1k, \u03c1k,0,\u2026,\u03c1k,T, respectively.

(17), there are different scenarios worth addressing: \u2022If we assume that the nonuniform transmission effect is absent and so the spreading rate is independent of the degree of the nodes (i.e. \u03b1=1), then \u03bb(k)=\u03bb0k/k=\u03bb0 and Eq. (17) reads as, (18)\u03bbo>1T+1\u22c5\u3008k\u3009\u3008k2\u3009. That is, the threshold \u03bb0c=1T+1\u22c5\u3008k\u3009\u3008k2\u3009. In particular, T=0 gives \u03bb0c=\u3008k\u3009\u3008k\u30092 which recovers the classical result [15].\u2022If the spreading rate is proportional to the inverse of the degree (i.e. \u03b1=0, maximum nonuniform transmission), we recover the expression previously obtained for the homogeneous network, i.e., (19)\u03bb0c=1(T+1)\u22c51A.\n\u2022For intermediate cases, i.e., \u03bb(k)=\u03bb0k\u03b1/k with 0<\u03b1<1, the critical threshold reads as (20)\u03bb0c=1T+1\u22c5\u3008k\u3009\u3008k1+\u03b1\u3009 where \u03b1=0 and \u03b1=1 correspond to two extreme cases previously analyzed.\n",

            "text": "In summary, we have studied the effects of increasing the infectious period of infected individuals that at the same time transmit the disease with a spreading rate which decreases with the number of neighbors. The latter mechanism is intended to model situations in which subjects avoid contacting all of their neighbors and therefore their contagion capabilities are reduced. The former, on the contrary, accounts for a common attitude of sick subjects, who quite often refrain from taking a treatment from the very initial stages of the disease, thus delaying their recovery. Through a mean-field analysis and numerical simulations, we have shown that the delayed recovery reduces the epidemic threshold whereas the nonuniform spreading has the opposite effect. It is worth stressing that in our model, the delayed recovery is introduced as an independent parameter, and not through smaller values of \u03b3, as the latter is a parameter that characterizes the disease and we are accounting for a behavioral reaction, i.e., that of postponing the treatment. When both ingredients are simultaneously present, whether or not the new effective epidemic threshold is reduced with respect to the standard case depends on their interplay: if contacts between spreaders and susceptible individuals are significantly reduced as could be the case in a real epidemic, then the disease-free region will be larger. Otherwise, the longer permanence of infected subjects as such will not be compensated by their reduced contagion capabilities. Altogether, our results point out that in order for different countermeasures to be effective, which usually include isolation of sick individuals and therefore cutting down the number of potential susceptible\u2013infectious contacts, other aspects such as the presence of \u201cfree-riders\u201d that delay their recovery should also be taken into account.",
