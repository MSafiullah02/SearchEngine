For example, a small percentage of coronavirus-infected cells possess N in the nucleolus (Hiscox et al., 2001). In a similar study using PRRSV, we observed that the percentage of infected cells containing N in the nucleolus was dependent on when observations were made. In addition, cells were identified that contained N in the nucleoplasmic region surrounding the nucleoli. These observations suggest that the localization of N to the nucleolus is a complex and highly regulated process.",

            "text": "The translocation of a protein from the cytoplasm, across the NPC, and into the nucleus is initiated by the binding of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) on the cargo protein to the importin-\u03b1 shuttle protein. The cargo/importin-\u03b1 complex binds to a second shuttle protein, importin-\u03b2, which is then targeted to the NPC. In the presence of additional accessory proteins, including Ran-GDP, and ATP as a source of energy, the cargo/importin complex is transported across the NPC and released into the nucleoplasm (reviewed in Gorlich and Kutay, 1999). Classical NLS sequences incorporate regions enriched in basic amino acids and generally conform to one of three types Nakai and Kanehisa, 1992, Hicks and Raikhel, 1995. The \u201cpat4\u201d NLS consists of a continuous stretch of four basic amino acids (lysine or arginine) or three basic amino acids associated with histidine or proline. The \u201cpat7\u201d NLS starts with a proline and is followed within three residues by a segment containing three basic residues out of four. The third type of NLS, known as a \u201cbipartite\u201d motif, consists of two basic amino acids, a 10-amino-acid spacer, and a 5-amino-acid segment containing at least three basic residues. There are exceptions to these established rules. Proteins that lack an NLS can localize to the nucleus as a result of cotransport with other nuclear proteins. Proteins which possess an NLS may remain cytoplasmic, especially if the NLS is not exposed on the protein's surface (Roberts et al., 1987). And finally, small proteins less than 50\u201370 kDa can passively diffuse through the nuclear pore complex Paine et al., 1975, Gorlich and Kutay, 1999. The addition of an NLS to a small protein that passively diffuses through the NPC confers to that protein all of the properties of NLS-dependent transport (Jans and Hubner, 1996).",

Therefore, the targeting of a protein to the nucleolus occurs through the diffusion of the protein through the nucleoplasm and accumulation in the nucleolus. Localization to the nucleolus is mediated by a nucleolar targeting sequence (NoTS), which functions by forming an interaction with a nucleolar component, such as a nucleolar protein, rRNA, or rDNA, or small nucleolar RNAs. By definition, the NoTS by itself cannot translocate a protein across the NPC, but once in the nucleoplasm is capable of targeting the protein to the nucleolus (Lixin et al., 2001). Another route to the nucleolus is the direct translocation of a protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus by cotransport with a nucleolar shuttle protein, such as nucleolin, fribrillarin, and B-23, which normally shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the mechanism of PRRSV N protein localization to the nucleolus by characterizing the individual oligopeptides domains, which participated in the translocation of the N protein across the NPC and localization to the nucleolus.",

The purpose of this series of experiments was to determine if the translocation of N protein was dependent on a specific NLS domain. Peptide sequence analysis of the N protein of the North American PRRSV isolate SDSU-23983 using the PSORT computer program identified two NLS motifs, a \u201cpat-4\u201d NLS, 10-KRKK, and a \u201cpat-7\u201d NLS, 41-PGKKNKK (Fig. 1). Based on a hydrophilicity plot of the peptide sequence, both NLSs were predicted to be located in regions of the N protein that are highly hydrophilic and accessible for interaction with shuttle proteins. For convenience, the putative NLSs were designated NLS-1 and NLS-2, respectively. Peptide sequences of the N protein from 70 North American isolates deposited in GenBank showed that both NLSs are highly conserved among North American PRRSV isolates. The principal difference between isolates was the conserved substitution of lysines with arginines (data not shown). The European Lelystad virus N protein also contains NLS-1 and NLS-2 domains, which are located at residues 9 and 47, respectively.",

MARC-145 cells, a monkey kidney cell line, were chosen because they support PRRSV replication to relatively high levels (Kim et al., 1993). As shown in Fig. 2A and B, the 25-kDa EGFP localized to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, which is consistent with passive diffusion. EGFP was excluded from the nucleolus and some cytoplasmic compartments. The fusion of N protein to EGFP altered the distribution of EGFP, resulting in the accumulation of fluorescent label in the nucleolus and decreased accumulation in the nucleoplasm surrounding the nucleoli (Fig. 2C and D). In previous work, colocalization of anti-N protein and nucleolar-specific antibodies were used to identify the nucleolus as the site of N protein accumulation (Rowland et al., 1999). Nucleoli, when viewed under phase-contrast microscopy, are apparent as highly refractive bodies within the nucleus.",

The protein products of NP(1\u201314)-EGFP and NP(39\u201348)-EGFP accumulated in the nucleus and nucleolus, with a small amount of fluorescence remaining in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 2E and F). These data indicated that NLS-1 and NLS-2 could function as NLS domains sufficient to localize EGFP to the nucleus, but provided no information on which NLS participated in the translocation of the native N protein to the nucleus. Therefore, the localization properties of NP-EGFP were studied after inactivation of each NLS. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace key lysine and arginine residues, the essential residues involved NLS function, with uncharged alanines or glycines. The mutant protein, NP(1\u2013123,G10G11)-EGFP, which lacked an intact NLS-1, localized to the nucleolus (see Fig. 2I). In a second experiment, NLS-1 was completely removed by deleting the first 14 amino acids from the N-terminus. The protein product, NP(14\u2013123)-EGFP, also localized to the nucleolus, indicating that NLS-1 was not involved in nuclear translocation.",

Removal of either lysine reduced the accumulation of NP-EGFP in the nucleolus (data not shown), whereas NP(1\u2013123,G43G44)-EGFP, which lacked both lysines, was retained in the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus/nucleolus, as shown in Fig. 2H. A phase-contrast image of the same cell (Fig. 2G) confirmed that nucleoli were present. These results suggested that lysines-43 and -44 formed part of the functional NLS peptide domain, which was required for the entry of N protein into the nucleus. Another possibility was that nuclear localization activity was lost in the mutant protein as a result of refolding caused by the lysine substitutions. We took advantage of a panel of six anti-N monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to probe the conformation of wild-type and mutant N proteins. All mAbs are known to interact with conformation-dependent epitopes distributed throughout the last 90 amino acids of the PRRSV N protein (see Table 1;\nNelson et al., 1993, Wootton et al., 1998, Wootton et al., 2001. The results of the antibody binding studies are summarized in Table 1. All antibodies reacted with the full-length NP-EGFP fusion protein, indicating that EGFP did not affect mAb recognition and presumably did not alter N protein conformation (Table 1). There was no immunoreactivity with EGFP alone or EGFP fused to a small N peptide, such as NP(43\u201372), which contained a small linear segment of the conformational epitope recognized by mAb. All mAbs reacted with the NLS-1 and NLS-2 mutant proteins, NP(14\u2013123)-EGFP and NP(1\u2013123,G43G44)-EGFP, respectively. Even though four of the six mAbs (MR-40, EP-147, JP-24, VO-17) recognize the same N proteins regions, amino acids 52 to 69 and 112 to 123, these mAb are distinguished from each other based on differences in reactivity with field isolates and mutant recombinant N proteins (personal communication, Eric Nelson, South Dakota State University; Wootton et al., 2001). Together these data identify NLS-2 as the principal localization signal sequence involved in the translocation of the native N protein into the nucleus.",

The lack of localization activity from NLS-1 could reflect the inhibitory activity of adjacent residues, which could block the interaction between the NLS and the receptor domain on the shuttle protein. Another possibility was that the NLS was blocked as a result of the tertiary or quaternary conformation of the N protein. Since mutations in the C-terminal 11 amino acids can significantly alter the conformation of the N protein (Wootton et al., 1998), we investigated the possibility that mutations in the C-terminus, sufficient to affect recognition by mAb, would reveal nuclear localization activity from NLS-1. The experimental approach was to follow the intracellular localization of the NLS-2 mutant, NP(1\u2013115,G43G44), which contained an eight-amino-acid deletion from the C-terminus. The result, presented in Fig. 3B, showed that NP(1\u2013115,G43G44)-EGFP localized to the nucleolus, whereas the parent mutant protein NP(1\u2013123,G43,G44)-EGFP remained cytoplasmic. To confirm that localization of NP(1\u2013115,G43G44) was NLS-1 dependent, we followed the localization of a NLS double mutant, NP(14\u2013115,G43G44)-EGFP. As shown in Fig. 3C, the protein product was retained in the cytoplasm, demonstrating the loss of NLS activity after removal of NLS-1. Removal of eight amino acids from the N protein resulted in the loss of immunoreactivity with SR-30 and VO-17 mAbs (Table 1), but did not alter recognition by SDOW-17, MR-30, or JP-24. The ability of a mutation in the C-terminus of the N protein to recover activity from NLS-1, which is located at the opposite end of the protein, demonstrates that the overall conformation of the native N protein is responsible for blocking NLS-1 activity. Furthermore, since the deletion of amino acids did not affect binding by three of the six mAbs, only a small conformational change is necessary to expose NLS-1.",

Immunoprecipitation of radiolabled proteins from infected cell lysates or in vitro translated products using N-specific antibodies yielded a protein, which migrated at approximately 15 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 1, Fig. 4B, lane 3). Immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated N protein, derived from the pCITE vector, yielded a slightly slower migrating product (Fig. 4B, lane 3). The slower migration was consistent with the addition of amino acid residues contributed by the pCITE vector. Since the PRRSV N protein typically forms noncovalent homodimers (Wootton and Yoo, 2003), GST-N was able to precipitate radiolabeled N from cell lysates from infected but not mock-infected cells (Fig, 4B, lanes 4 and 5). As a negative control, Sepharose GST alone failed to pull down proteins corresponding to the size of native (Fig. 4B lanes 1 and 2) or in vitro translated N proteins (data not shown). N proteins from PRRSV-infected cells or from in vitro translation were able to form an interaction with GST-importin-\u03b1 and GST-importin-\u03b2 (see Fig. 4A). No bands of the correct molecular size were observed when radiolabeled proteins from mock-infected cells or translation products from pCITE vector RNA were incubated with GST-importin proteins. These data show that nuclear shuttle proteins have the capacity to form specific interactions with the PRRSV N protein. Furthermore, the capacity of importin-\u03b1 and importin-\u03b2 to bind in vitro translated N protein indicates that N-importin interactions are independent of other viral proteins.",

The NoLS associated with viral proteins is usually no longer than 20 amino acid residues and possesses at least nine basic residues overall, including one continuous stretch of four basic amino acids, or two stretches of three basic amino acids. Furthermore, an NLS is usually embedded within the NoLS peptide sequence (Kubota et al., 1999). Peptide sequence analysis of the regions surrounding NLS-1 and NLS-2 showed no identity with this type of NoLS motif (see Fig. 1). Therefore, to locate the smallest peptide sufficient to function as an NoLS, amino acids we followed the localization of NP-EGFP fusion proteins after sequentially removal of amino acid residues from the N- and C-terminal ends. A summary of the results, presented in Fig. 5, showed that the N protein construct lacking the first 40 amino acids (NP(41\u2013123)) or last 51 amino acids (NP(1\u201372)) produced a nucleolar\u2013cytoplasmic distribution pattern similar to the full-length N protein, with a small amount of fluorescence in the nucleoplasmic region surrounding the nucleoli. Removal of a single amino acid from either construct, NP(42\u2013123) or NP(1\u201371), produced a change in the distribution of EGFP fluorescence, which was most noticeable as an increase in the accumulation of the fusion protein in the nucleoplasm surrounding the nucleoli combined with a corresponding decrease of fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5D and E). The 41\u201372 peptide, when fused to EGFP, localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus (Fig. 5G) demonstrating that the 41\u201372 oligopeptide alone can produce a localization pattern similar to the full-length wild-type N protein, supporting the possibility that this domain contains the NoLS sequence.",

Therefore, the absence of immunoreactivity suggests that the N-terminal region, including NLS-1, is normally hidden from the surface of the protein. NLS-1 nuclear localization activity was recovered following the removal of eight amino acids from the C-terminus. The loss of SR-30 and VO-17 reactivity indicated a change in the conformation of the N protein, sufficient to expose NLS-1. Another possibility is that NLS-1 is normally blocked as a result of oligomerization with other N protein molecules. Oligomerization with other N protein molecules may block NLS-1 without affecting the accessibility of NLS-2. In the context of the native protein, NLS-1 can be considered a cryptic NLS.",

            "text": "NLS-dependent nuclear transport is initiated by the interaction between the NLS on the cargo protein with importin-\u03b1 (Gorlich and Mattaj, 1996). A separate importin-\u03b2-binding (IBB) domain on the N-terminus of the importin-\u03b1 is responsible for forming the interaction between the importin-\u03b1/cargo complex and importin-\u03b2 (Moroianu et al., 1996). Importin-\u03b2 does not contain an NLS binding site; however, the NLS on viral proteins, such as HIV Rev, can bind directly to importin-\u03b2 (Henderson and Percipalle, 1997). Using a pull-down assay, we demonstrated that the N protein of PRRSV is able to form interactions with murine GST-importin-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 proteins (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the formation of an N protein/importin complex using in vitro translated N demonstrates that N protein binding is independent of other viral proteins. Even though these results demonstrate the capacity of N to form stable interactions with importin, these data do not exclude the possibility for the participation of other shuttle proteins in the translocation of N into the nucleus/nucleolus. For example, major nucleolar proteins, such as nucleolin and B-23, can function in the transport of viral proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus through the interaction between long stretches of acidic residues in B-23 and nucleolin with highly basic NoLS domains. B-23 can form stable interactions with Tat, Rev, Rex, and adenovirus V proteins Frankhauser et al., 1991, Stauber and Pavlakis, 1998, Adachi et al., 1993, Matthews, 2001. Hiscox et al. (2001), after comparing the peptide sequences of infectious bronchitis virus and PRRSV N proteins, concluded that the PRRSV NoLS was located between amino acids 37 and 52 (Table 3). However, our results present a modified picture in which an overlapping peptide covering amino acids 41\u201372 was capable of reproducing the nucleolar\u2013cytoplasmic localization pattern of the wild-type N protein (Fig. 5). Even though the 41\u201372 domain contains an NLS, which is consistent with other viral NoLS sequences, there are some notable differences. The overall length is longer than the 20 amino acids for the typical viral NoLS sequences (Table 3)\n(Kubota et al., 1999). The second difference is a paucity of basic residues (eight lysines/arginines) and the incorporation of five negatively charged amino residues, making the 41\u201372 domain relatively more acidic when compared with other viral NoLS domains. At this time we propose that the 41\u201372 peptide contains an NLS, represented by the core peptide KKNKK, and a separate nucleolar localization domain, which targets N to the nucleolus.",

Nucleolar N could also have a neutral effect on cell function, i.e., a simple case of molecular mimicry. For instance, peptide regions enriched in basic amino acids, required to bind viral RNA, can mimic NLS and/or NoLS sequences (LaCasse and Lefebvre, 1995). One intriguing possibility is that localization of N protein to the nucleus/nucleolus represents a novel host cell protection strategy. The sequestration of large quantities of nucleocapsid precursor in the nucleolus would deprive a cytoplasmic virus of an essential structural protein. The incorporation of an export signal in the N protein would represent a counterstrategy, which would ensure that a sufficient quantity of N protein was returned to the cytoplasm where it could participate in the assembly of virions.",

GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Novagen) as described in Wootton et al. (1998). One hundred milliliters of log phase bacterial culture was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and after 3 h bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml of PBS, and sonicated on ice three times for 30 s. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and proteins were disassociated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with constant agitation. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant, containing the GST fusion proteins, was incubated with 100 \u03bcl of a 50% slurry of glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Beads complexed to the GST fusion proteins were collected at 500g and washed three times in PBS and resuspended in a final volume of 250 \u03bcl of PBS containing 30% glycerol and 0.1% Triton X-100. To produce radiolabeled recombinant N protein, the N gene was cloned into pCITE and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase MEGAscript (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting RNA was translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation kit (Promega) in the presence of 50 \u03bcCi/ml of [35S]methionine (New England Nuclear, specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol). To produce the radiolabeled authentic viral N protein, PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells were labeled at 30 h post-infection with 50 \u03bcCi/ml of [35S]methionine for 8 h. Cells were washed and lysed using RIPA buffer (TNE with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS).",
