We included the respiratory pathogens human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza, parainfluenza (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus/enterovirus (RhV), and coronavirus.

Respiratory support was defined as the need for supplemental oxygen, bilevel or continuous airway pressure, conventional mechanical ventilation, high-frequency oscillation ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

            "text": "Limited contemporary data that define the impact of RVI on pediatric HSCT recipients exist. Luj\u00e1n-Zilbermann et al. [3] assembled a retrospective single-center US cohort of 281 pediatric HSCT recipients between 2000 and 2012 and reported an RVI incidence rate within 1 year of transplant of 11%. In another single-center cohort of 176 pediatric HSCT recipients in Korea, the RVI incidence within 28 days of HSCT was 5.1%, whereas in a larger single-center cohort from Canada, the RVI incidence within 100 days of transplant was noted to be 6.4% [4, 5]. The RVI rates from these single-center studies are lower than the 16.6% incidence of H-RVI in our cohort; however, 2 of the studies documented their rates within 1 to 3 months after the transplant, which makes it difficult to compare the rates accurately. In addition, the criteria for respiratory testing, specific respiratory pathogens considered, and reliance on less sensitive nonmolecular diagnostic testing likely contributed to the different RVI rates in the previous reports.",

Nonetheless, this estimate of H-RVI incidence might underestimate the actual incidence. The etiology for this underestimation is multifactorial, including variation in PCR diagnostics according to site (eg, not all sites tested for each virus [eg, coronavirus] during the study period) and variation in the threshold for performing viral diagnostic testing on patients who presented with a symptomatic respiratory illness. In addition, some patients might have been evaluated for an RVI in an outpatient setting or at a site remote from the transplant center.",

The median times to onset of coronavirus, RhV, PIV, and RSV were shorter than the times to onset of influenza and HMPV. This longer duration between transplant day and H-RVI onset might be biased by a preference to perform transplants on children during the summer, when possible; thus, pathogens that have viral seasons that start in the summer or fall (eg, PIV or RSV) would seem to have shorter median times to onset than viruses with a seasonal onset later in the winter (eg, influenza, hMPV). We did not document the month of the transplant because of institutional review board constraints, so we cannot confirm this supposition. In addition, although a majority of H-RVI events in our cohort presented in the first 100 days after HSCT, 25% of these infections occurred after 150 days. Therefore, clinicians should be aware that the risk of a significant H-RVI event persists well beyond the first 100 days after transplant.",

Pulmonary complications during the 3-month follow-up period were noted in 13% of the children, and 11% of the patients died within 3 months of H-RVI onset. Furthermore, 28% of allogeneic HSCT recipients developed new-onset GVHD within 3 months of their H-RVI. This rate of GVHD is similar to the 10% to 30% rate reported in general for pediatric allogeneic HSCT recipients [7]. Although only 50% of the fatal incident H-RVI events were likely or possibly the result of the RVI, it is possible that the RVI contributed indirectly to the remaining deaths. These findings are consistent with those from previous smaller cohorts in which RVIs were associated with a 15% all-cause case fatality, of which 33% were attributed to the RVI [8].",

This association with steroid exposure was linked previously to poor outcomes in adult patients with HMPV, RSV, or PIV [9\u201311] and pediatric patients with PIV [12]. It is interesting that recent exposure to nonsteroid immunosuppressive therapies was not associated with worse outcomes in any of the 3 multivariate models. This measure was inclusive of a heterogeneous group of agents administered for GVHD prophylaxis or treatment. Grouping these agents into a single variable might have limited our ability to detect associations with specific immunosuppressive agents.",

            "text": "Beyond the limitations already mentioned, additional limitations of this study are worth noting. First, in the multivariable model, the viral pathogens were considered equally in terms of their potential to contribute to morbidity and death in the 3-month period after RVI onset. In particular, rhinovirus was the most common pathogen, and the ability to diagnose acute RhV disease can be challenging because of the potential for prolonged RhV viral detection in these hosts [16]. It is notable that pulmonary complications related to RhV infection, including the need for oxygen support, pressure support, or mechanical ventilation, seemed to occur at rates similar to those found after respiratory infections caused by RSV, PIV, or HMPV. Future analyses should focus on models specific to each pathogen; however, such subanalyses would be limited by few events. Second, we did not collect detailed data on patients in the HSCT cohort without an RVI but instead chose to focus on the subset of patients who were diagnosed with an RVI. Therefore, our multivariate analyses were focused on assessing factors that contributed to poor outcomes only among patients with RVI. We were unable to assess factors such as GVHD therapy or monthly intravenous immunoglobulin administration, which might increase or reduce the risk of sustaining an RVI in the post-HSCT period. Third, data regarding utilization of specific antiviral therapies, such as neuraminidase inhibitors, DAS181 (an investigational sialidase fusion protein), ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin, were collected. However, because of the small number of patients who received therapy for a specific virus, it was not possible to assess the comparative effectiveness of these agents. Last, the study definition for H-RVI required the presence of respiratory symptoms. This requirement would result in the lack of detection of an RVI event that presented with nonspecific symptoms such as fever and thus further the potential for underestimating RVI in this patient population.",
