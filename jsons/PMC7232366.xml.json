To allow the entry of the viral particles, the S protein is cleaved by cellular proteases at the S1/S2 and the S2\u2032 site. Then, the viral capside is fused with the cellular membrane, a process driven by the S2 subunit [9]. It has been described that SARS-CoV entrance is mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [10], and that the serine protease TMPRSS2 is responsible for the S protein cleavage [11,12]. The analysis of the sequences of the receptor binding motif (RBM) within the receptor binding domain revealed that it is responsible for the binding to ACE2 and that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have conserved residues, suggesting that their binding with ACE2 could be similar, while the same residues are absent in other coronaviruses [13,14].

The protease Renin, generated mainly in the kidney, cleaves angiotensinogen to generate Angiotensin I (AngI); the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cleaves Ang I to produce Ang II, a key effector of the RAAS. AngII induces activation of Ang II type 1 and 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R) in order to obtain vasoconstriction and inactivation of vasodilator bradykinin by cleavage. ACE2 is a terminal carboxypeptidase, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, and a potent negative regulator of RAAS, localized on the apical surface of well-differentiated airway epithelia, especially ciliated cells [15].",

Indeed, when AT1R and AT2R are activated, they lead to the increased expression of proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-8/Cytokine-induced Neutrophil Chemoattractant-3 and interleukin-6, triggering an inflammatory process in the lungs and other organs. In particular, AT1R activates NFkB transcription factor and AP-1, which in turn increases cytokine expression, apoptosis, vasoconstriction, fibroproliferation, the retention of Na+, and the enhancement of lung injury. The endogenous Ang II inhibits alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and dysregulates ENaC expression via AT1R, contributing to alveolar filling and pulmonary edema.",

Moreover, the genes of the network encoded for protein of the vacuolar part and vacuolar membrane. Finally, among their activity, they were mainly involved in Aryldialkylphosphatase activity, adenosylhomocisteinase activity, trialkylsulfonium hydrolase activity, acetate-CoA and CoA ligase activity, isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, and hydrolase activity acting on ether bond.

            "text": "The Aryldialkylphosphatase activity is an enzymatic activity possessed by the paraoxonase (PON) gene family. This enzymatic activity is important for the protection of the cells from oxidative damage for the lipid oxidation metabolism and for the innate immunity response. It is reduced during hepatitis virus B infection and correlates with the functional status of the liver [40]. The inhibition of adenosylhomocysteinase activity, obtained by adenosine dialdehyde, has been described as a potent inhibitor of vaccinia virus early protein synthesis and viral mRNA methylation, suggesting that adenosylhomocysteinase activity is important in the translation of viral proteins and virus replication [41]. Trialkylsulfonium hydrolase activity is one of the enzymatic activities required for the viral replication [42]. Increase in lipid synthesis is essential for viral infection. It has been demonstrated that lipid reduction impacts viral infection (e.g., human cytomegalovirus) [43]. In this process, the central precursor for lipid biosynthesis is cytosolic acetyl CoA (Ac-CoA) [43]; this is the reason why the pathway analysis (Figure 2D) indicated acetate conversion (into acetyl-CoA) as an important ACE2-related pathway. In the same way, leucine degradation could become a source of Acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate by \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) activity, intermediate also of cholesterol biosynthesis [44], described in the pathway analysis. In addition, the results of pathway analysis showed that the genes were enriched in the cholesterol biosynthesis. The role of cholesterol is essential as the entry of pathogenic viruses into the cell is favoured by the presence of cholesterol on the eukaryotic host cells, as discussed before [45].",

In the case of the influenza A virus, HSPs are important for the induction of polymerase activity to induce nuclear import and export and assembly of viral proteins during viral replication [46,47]. Moreover, the heat shock protein A4 (HSPA4) expression is upregulated in patients affected by hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma [48], in particular in those with earlier recurrence.

This enzyme takes part in the synthesis of prostaglandin, produced in the course of the cascade of the inflammation process and has relation to the pathogenesis of pain, inflammation and fever. Fluticasone propionate is a new generation corticosteroid used in asthma treatment [54]. Its activity is due to the diffusion of the molecule into the pulmonary cells where it binds to cytoplasmic receptors. The binding to the receptor activates the translocation of the complex into the nucleus where it inhibits cytokine-induced production of proinflammatory proteins. This leads to the suppression of inflammatory mediators, reducing the number of mast cells and lymphocytes [55]. Thiabendazole is an effective antifungal agent and it has been proposed that the drug may have anti-inflammatory properties also in the case of viral infection [56]. Porfimer sodium (photofrin) is a photosensitizing agent used in photodynamic and radiation therapy of tumors; this therapeutic approach has also been proposed in the case of viral infection treatment [57].",
