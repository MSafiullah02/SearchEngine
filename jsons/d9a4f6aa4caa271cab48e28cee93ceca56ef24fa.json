In the area of our survey, Vietnamese farmers, who are one of the front lines of the fi ght against H5N1, are called upon to collaborate to the international fi ght against the virus. Our study highlights that direct (poultry mortality) and indirect impacts (consequence of the measures imposed by the government to contain the virus, fl uctuation of consumers' demand, etc.) tend to be relatively limited when compared to the permanent state of instability which characterises the context of poultry production in the surveyed village. This instability is mainly related to numerous and regular poultry infectious diseases and market fl uctuations. If international community considers H5N1 as a zoonotic risk and a pandemic threat which asks for emergency tools, H5N1 is framed by the farmers of our study as an epizootic problem manageable through routinised measures. These measures aim at minimising the economic impact of the disease rather than preventing poultry and Human from the disease. Consequently, local management of the disease cannot fi t with the precautionary approach promoted by the international community.",

On the contrary, we will focus in this chapter on the active role of farmers in risk management and on the constraints, opportunities, values and interests that underpin their behaviours. The purpose is to understand the logic of disease management at the local scale. We apply this approach to the case of poultry farmers facing H5N1 in a village in Vietnam.",

Furthermore, to satisfy the resumption of consumer demand, the Vietnamese government reduced import taxes on poultry from 2006 onwards, generating a new situation of competition for locally produced poultry [taxes were reduced by between 20 % and 60 % depending on the product cate-gory (Tuong 2010 ) .

However, in the long term, these farmers would have benefi tted from their capacity to adapt to new market demands, in particular to new safety standards. Semicommercial farmers (type 3) could have suffered more lasting effects due to their more limited fi nancial capacity to reconstitute their livestock after the crisis and to invest in equipment 1 Moreover, the government intends to modernise poultry farming in the long term and to facilitate the introduction of various biosafety measures, in particular with the support of the agro-industrial sector (e.g. the Thai group Charoen Pokphand) by means of a process of implementing contracts with farmers and relocating farms. 2 Cost per bird evaluated for fl ock of approximately 100 animals. It can be broken down as follows: 200 dongs for the vaccination, 550 dongs for the transport certifi cates and 2,000 dongs for the culling operations carried out in a certifi ed slaughterhouse (with one euro equivalent to approximately 20,000 dongs over the period being studied). enabling them to improve the safety of the fl ocks. Sector 4 (backyard poultry farmers) was not particularly affected in terms of income as the poultry is intended for consumption within the household or for sale on a local market less concerned by the transport restrictions imposed (Agrifood Consulting 2007 ). 2. The cognitive dimension: this was highlighted through studies based on the KAB approach (Knowledge/Attitude/Behaviour). These studies have recorded a poor or incorrect knowledge of avian fl u on the part of the farmers, served to justify numerous projects aimed at educating and sensitising farmers with regard to this new risk (UNICEF, Academy for Educational Development, etc.). 3.

Before 1993, most of the inhabitants of this village derived their livelihoods from small-scale agriculture (essentially rice) and pig farming. From 1993 onwards, a highly proactive government policy encouraged the zone to specialise in poultry production. A state farm was set up in Dai Xuyen in a neighbouring parish to provide farmers with day-old chickens (DOCs) with a view to rearing broilers. The state farm subsequently encouraged the diversifi cation of poultry farming activities in the area by also supplying parental chicks for the production of chicks and ducklings. In the village of Duyen Yet, the production of chickens which had been developed was for the most part quickly replaced by the production of chicks and ducklings with the installation of several private hatcheries. At the start of the new millennium, a land reorganisation policy enabled the creation of farms devoted to fi sh farming and intensive poultry farming in the lower parts of the village, thanks to major earthmoving works (allowing the raising of ground for the houses and rearing pens to be built). These farms are called \"breeding farms\" as opposed to \"village farms\".",

A small proportion of them (5-10 %) have an adjacent body of water enabling them to rear Peking ducks. These farms correspond to the commercial type (type 3, according to the FAO classifi cation).

These farms (there are around 30 of them) are more highly capitalised and specialised than those above. The main activity conducted in these farms is fi sh and poultry production with generally between 500 and 1,000 chickens per batch (the manure serves to fertilise the ponds). The labour force is based on paid labour. Access to water offers them the advantage of being able to breed Peking ducks in addition to other types of poultry. These farms correspond to the industrial type (type 2, in the FAO classifi cation).",

Thus, according to one of the parties interviewed in relation to the general instability of agricultural prices, \"farming is a bit of a lottery, it's a question of luck\u2026 we can't plan for every eventuality. Man can't calculate as well as God\". This instability is linked to the fact that poultry prices and day-old chicken and duckling prices vary considerably under the effects of a wide range of factors. Many of these factors are seasonal (high consumer demand, in particular at New Year, high demand for ducklings after the rice harvest, low demand for chicks and ducklings in the cold season, etc.). However, beyond these seasonal variations and their complex interactions which are nevertheless more or less predictable, there are other accidental factors. This is the case of the frequent risk of fl ooding which is particularly important for breeding farms, not only directly affecting the farms (fl ooded buildings) but also impacting the demand for chicks or ducklings from other farmers.

Moreover, the competition faced by farmers from imported chicken meat (with the reduction in import duties) was exacerbated by the increased price of food following the global crisis of 2007-2008 (Vietnamese poultry farming is highly dependent on imported corn; e.g. the price of this feed for laying hens available in the village stores increased by a factor of 2.5 at this time).",

One claimed to have lost two thirds of his 800 birds to disease in 2005, although he did not know which disease. He mortgaged his land to borrow money to buy new birds. In 2007, he lost a large sum of money, not because of disease but because prices were too low.

Anyway, here, we have to rear animals because rice doesn't pay well\"; or: \"We are obliged to continue rearing poultry because the district specialises in it\". 6 The renewed activity did not necessarily involve the same species as before. We have already explained that farmers increase the number of species raised to cope with the hazards of the market. Ducks are considered to be less sensitive than chickens to the H5N1 virus. To what extent did avian fl u infl uence the choice of these species? The answers vary considerably: In several cases, the activity was renewed with broilers as they follow a rapid production cycle and the return on investment is quick. However, according to certain farmers, there are fewer broiler chicken farms following the outbreak of avian fl u because chickens are more sensitive to the virus and farmers do not want to vaccinate animals with a relatively short cycle. Some farmers believe it is more judicious to rear red chickens rather than white chickens and Peking ducks rather than Muscovy ducks because they are less vulnerable. Others feel that the market is currently highly favourable to Muscovy ducks, thereby explaining why some farmers opt for this species. In light of this wide range of arguments, it is diffi cult to identify a clear trend in terms of the choice of species; the predominant strategy remains the diversifi cation of species: \"Ducks are more resilient than Muscovy ducks and the vaccination of ducks against avian fl u is more effi cient. 7 During an outbreak of the fl u, it is therefore better to keep ducks. But people continue to combine the two\".",

In the past, farmers developed strategies, which they once again called on in the context of the avian fl u outbreaks. These strategies aim more to minimise the indirect effects of the disease (i.e. strategies of alleviation) than to avoid the disease itself (i.e. strategies of prevention and precaution) and would appear to have been relatively successful, at the scale of the village.",

Similarly, avian fl u has been responsible for a national and international crisis: avian fl u outbreaks encouraged to revise scientifi c knowledge on the ecology of viruses (in particular with regard to ducks); to review the governance, in particular international health governance; to design new decision-making process in situations of uncertainty; and to rethink the relations of the Vietnamese authorities with the international community, but at the level of the farms in the village concerned by the study, the reaction was limited to a half-hearted criticism of the government (within the limits of what is possible within the country) for what was perceived as excessive communication concerning the fl u (and the negative impact that this had on consumption) and on its decision to lower taxes on imported poultry. 8 The potential contribution of social sciences to the study of infectious diseases is not limited to the analysis of their social factors, in an operational objective, nor to a critical analysis of the inequalities in front of the diseases, in relation with differences in social classes or territories; it is also to contribute to the understanding of the social dynamics that give existence to a phenomenon (Barbier and Prete 2010 ) . Our contribution is to show that this dynamic takes place at different levels, from local to international, mobilising different framings of the disease. These framings evolve with time, with periods of alignment and divergences. These divergences may lead to competing answers to the problem.",

Since then, the province offi cially declared the presence of the virus in February 2004 and then again in August 2004 (declarations made to the OIE in 2004). According toDelquigny et al. ( 2004 ), it can be roughly estimated that between 5 % and 10 % of the birds in the province were affected by the H5N1 virus. Preventive culling affected only 0.5 % of the poultry farms in Ha Tay, primarily the large industrial farms [which explains the much higher percentage of animals culled, reaching 13.6 % of the Ha Tay poultry population(Agrifood Consulting International  2007 )]. Despite the fact that outbreaks continue to be declared in the rest of the country, no further outbreak had been declared in Ha Tay province since August 2004 at the moment of the survey (except one very localised outbreak in 2007).",
