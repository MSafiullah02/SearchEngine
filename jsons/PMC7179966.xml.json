Because patients with SAH and other cerebrovascular diseases can present with fever and pulmonary infection, it is unrealistic to rapidly differentiate from COVID-19 co-infection based on symptoms alone. As community spread of COVID-19 has reached endemic proportions, we now regard all emergency cases as suspected COVID-19\u2013positive cases until proven negative by testing. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was upgraded to an appropriate level for all personnel in the ER to include N95 masks, full gown, goggles, and face shield. Our observation has been that endotracheal intubation poses the highest risk for secondary transmission to healthcare workers and we recommend performing nasotracheal intubation whenever possible. Any emergency intubation must be done wearing 2 layers of face protection (goggles and face shield), and ideally under positive ventilation conditions.",

To meet the isolation requirements, our tertiary referral hospital assigned a separate imaging area serving the ER, with MRI (3T magnet), CT (CTA), and DSA for suspected cases. We also assigned an OR and catheter lab to serve this contamination zone with easy access to the imaging area. Suspected cases are moved to the OR directly from the ER, receiving proper ventilation while in the contamination zone to meet our current protocols for preventing nosocomial infection. Because airborne infection poses the highest risk of large-scale infection among healthcare workers, we have developed a separate ventilation system for the contamination zone.",

In our experience, it is clear that coronavirus is present in the blood and secretions of infected patients, and all personnel involved in invasive procedures use specific precautions to avoid contacting body fluids and aerosols from suspected patients. This includes wearing full PPE with goggles and face shield to avoid fluid splashes, in particular.",

We also do the following: 1) Ensure that the air in the OR is disinfected between surgeries under a standard protocol approved by our infection control team. 2) Use disposable drapes and covers exclusively in the contamination zone for easy cleaning. 3) Limit OR staff to 4 hours in the contamination zone, partially due to strict adherence to PPE requirements, especially N95 masks, which can be more uncomfortable than standard surgical masks. 4) Proactively rest staff every 4 hours to prevent dehydration when wearing heavy PPE; these staff are also isolated for a period of time before returning to new surgeries, depending on staff availability.",

As of March 30, there have been 2974 confirmed cases and more than 60 deaths among the local healthcare team in Hubei. The cases are centralized in major hospitals, and most of them are not from infectious or respiratory disease services.1 However, the situation improved dramatically after taking strict precautions\u2014there is no infection reported among fully equipped healthcare workers who were recruited to support Wuhan province (6200 nationally, 628 from Tianjin) since February 2020. The standard precautions for the general public are absolutely inadequate for health workers. Don\u2019t reinvent the wheel. Please maximize protection in all ways\u2014this is the firsthand experience from China to preserve healthcare resources for the battle against this epidemic.",
