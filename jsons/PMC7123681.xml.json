The field of plant virology traditionally has focused on agricultural systems, with little study of viruses found in wild plants. In the past decade, several efforts have begun to fill these gaps in the form of biodiversity surveys. These surveys have given us a new view into the true diversity of plant viruses, as well as their distribution.",

Previously the most common methods for virus detection were protein based immunological tests such as ELISA, or nucleotide specific PCR assays. Neither of these are sensitive enough to detect low titers of virus in wild plants or general enough to detect novel viruses, or even related strains or species. NGS technology has boosted our ability to fully sequence whole genomes, and advanced the field of metagenomics, the study of all the genetic information from a given environment. When the requirement for culture is removed, the ability to sequence and identify fastidious or unculturable microbes becomes possible.",

Metagenomics can be used to identify novel virus species, using various techniques to enrich viral nucleic acids such as isolating specific forms of RNA (dsRNA, siRNA, ssRNA) or virus particle isolation. Each method has positive and negative aspects (Stobbe and Roossinck 2014; Roossinck et al. 2015). While NGS can be used for virus discovery, it also has been applied to plant virus diagnostics (Stobbe et al. 2013; Massart et al. 2014). NGS also has been used to look further into the population diversity of individual virus strains. Using this deep sequencing, one is able to determine all of the minor variants found in a given infection (Simmons et al. 2012). NGS has applications in many evolutionary questions regarding systemic movement, vectoring and epidemiology.",

This variation comes from many sources, including high mutation rates of RNA viruses, recombination and reassortment. The variation we see within a single plant host has profound effects on the how the virus responds to selective pressures associated with new hosts, and factors such as the bottleneck events associated with cell-to-cell movement or vectoring. Additionally, with our ever increasing knowledge of the breadth of virus diversity, as well as advances in technology, questions of the deep evolutionary history of viruses and their relationship to their hosts are beginning to be answered. While there has been a large body of work on algae-infecting viruses (VanEtten and Dunigan 2012), here we only consider the viruses of vascular plants.",

            "text": "Agriculture is a human invention, and the cultivation of crops has propelled the human race to increasing cultural and technological advances, but with this advancement we have disturbed many natural systems throughout our history. Domestication of the earliest crops probably began about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago (Balter 2007), presumably with their viruses experiencing a shift in selective pressure as well (Stukenbrock and McDonald 2008). Densely spaced, monoculture crops have been increasingly favored due to the ease of production, but these conditions also are excellent for the spread and infection of viruses and other deleterious microbes within the crop (Thresh 1982; Power and Mitchell 2004). To combat the yield loss associated with virus\u2013induced disease, breeders have focused efforts on engineering disease resistant cultivars of crops. However, several forms of virus variation, such as the high mutation rates of RNA and some DNA viruses, recombination, and reassortment lead to resistance breaking (Duffy and Holmes 2008; McDonald and Linde 2002; Harrison 2002). Although breeding of resistant cultivars has had some success, other methods such as increasing the plant species diversity in a given area, breaking the spatial and temporal components of the disease cycle, have been suggested (Ratnadass et al. 2012). For example, genetic diversity (heterosis) induced tolerance to Turnip mosaic virus in wild cress (Lepidium sp.) hybrids, while plants that were selfed were more susceptable to disease, suggesting that small populations with low genetic diversity could lead to increased disease symptoms, and infection rates (Houliston et al. 2015). Intercropping cowpea with cassava or plantains has reduced the incidence of viruses in Central America (Valverde et al. 1982). These practices suggest that increases in plant diversity, either within a species or with diverse species, could lower the incidence or pathology of viruses (see Sect. 8.2.3).",

            "text": "With the globalization of today\u2019s society, it is not surprising to find that humans are playing a role in the movement of plant viruses. Human movement of both the plants and vectors associated with pathogens has facilitated the spread of viruses. The effects of climate change in the form of CO2 and ozone may change the impacts of viruses on their plant hosts (Trebicki et al. 2015). While many pathogens move closer to the poles as climate change occurs, there is some evidence that viruses and nematodes are moving closer to the equator (Bebber et al. 2013). This may be an analytical artifact as viral symptoms are often misdiagnosed. Increases in the range of insect vectors of viruses due to numerous factors, including climate change, predicts increased virus spread (Fereres 2015).",

Using insect vectors as targets for virus discovery is an attractive opportunity. Vector-enabled metagenomics is a recent method for virus discovery that allows one to discover and characterize viruses that are in the area that the vector occupies, including both cultivated and wild plants. In a recent study using vector-enabled metagenomics 79 % of the sequences obtained were related to known viruses, suggesting that many vector transmitted viruses are known (Ng et al. 2011). This number was much higher than the number of identifiable virus sequences found in wild plants, where as many as 60 % of sequences from virus-enriched pools have no similarity to sequences in GenBank (Roossinck et al. 2015).",

            "text": "The \u201cViral Manipulation Hypothesis\u201d states that by modifying the production of certain volatiles, the plant host will be more attractive to the virus\u2019 vectors (Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2013). Vector transmission mechanisms of plant viruses influence the effects the virus has on the plant host, with persistently transmitted viruses tending to either improve the host quality for the vector or mimic high quality, and nonpersistantly transmitted viruses lowering quality to facilitate the rapid dispersal of the viruliforous insect to neighboring plants (Mauck et al. 2012). Host manipulation is seen in unrelated families of plant viruses, implying convergent evolution (Wu et al. 2014). Barley yellow mosaic virus (BYDV) is persistently transmitted by the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Virus-free aphids have a feeding preference for BYDV-infected plants, while the reverse is true for BYDV-carrying aphids (Ingwell et al. 2012). Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a member of the Bromoviridae family, increases the release of volatiles that mimic healthy plants, attracting vectors despite the low quality of the plant for the aphids (Mauck et al. 2015b). Additionally, CMV effects other non-vectoring insects, repelling some while attracting others, in the absence of aphids (Mauck et al. 2015a). In mixed infections, competition can favor one microbe over another, as seen with the potyvirus, Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) out-competing another potyvirus, Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV). ZYMV and WMV are very similar viruses, in terms of genetics, hosts, and vectors. These similarities places them in direct competition with each other. One important difference is in vector manipulation; ZYMV manipulates the host-aphid relationship, while WMV does not. When co-infecting a plant, ZYMV will maintain its typical level of replication, while the replication of WMV is reduced. Despite this, WMV is still transmitted from a mixed infection, taking advantage of ZYMV host manipulation that attracts the aphid vectors (Salvaudon et al. 2013). In an analysis of genetic turnover during transmission, several clones containing the same mutation leading to a premature stop codon was found within a plant. Further transmissions using this experimental isolate lost this mutation, but this suggests that ZYMV has the ability to complement defective ZYMV genomes in the aphid vector (Simmons et al. 2011).",

These viruses, that cause disease in crops, may be asymptomatic in other hosts. For example, Peanut stunt virus causes disease in peanuts, but is asymptomatic in clover (Sherwood 1997). The presence of highly susceptible hosts in a plant community can increase the incidence of the virus across all susceptible species in the community (Power 2008). Several scenarios can be seen where the spread of virus moves between an asymptomatic native host to cultivated plants (Jones 2014). Emergent viral diseases may come from \u201csilent\u201d infections within a nearby wild population, and are driven by anthropogenic factors, such as food production or the introduction of vectors (Anderson et al. 2004). In Africa, there have been several emergent viruses in agricultural systems. While many changes in the pathogens themselves have promoted the emergence of disease, changes in agricultural practices have also promoted the introductions. Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV, in the genus Sobemovirus) infects Oryza sp. in both wild and agricultural systems. RYMV was first described in 1966 in Kenya and is currently an economically important plant virus. The rise of rice production in Kenya is thought to be the main driver of RYMV spread, as epidemics of the virus were not seen until after the intensification of rice production in the 1960s (Fargette et al. 2006). Despite many examples of host jumps leading to disease, there have been examples of viruses that have switched hosts several times with no apparent increase in pathology (Thresh 2006).",

A lowered incidence of two begomoviruses was seen in wild peppers with decreasing levels of cultivation or management, suggesting a dilution effect with higher levels of biodiversity (Pag\u00e1n et al. 2012). This correlation with biodiversity appears to hold true with CMV in wild plants, but not with CMV in crops (Sacrist\u00e1n et al. 2004). The loss of biodiversity appears to increase the movement of a virus across the agro-eco border, but a high degree of biodiversity can lead to a large number of viral species, which may serve as a reservoir for new infections (Keesing et al. 2010). Opportunistic viruses quickly move into susceptible crops, decrease, then recover in the susceptible population, causing a rapid cycles of epidemics and decline (Harrison 1981; Thresh 1981). In France, where ZYMV and WMV are both present, only WMV has significant natural reserviours, which explains the fragmented nature of ZYMV incidence across France (Lecoq et al. 2014). In Spain, two strains of the potexvirus Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV-EU and PepMV-CH2) co-circulate among tomato crops, with the CH2 strain being the dominate strain. PepMV-EU primarily exists in coinfections with PepMV-CH2, and these coinfections allow for an extended host range of PepMV, thus extending the potential number of reservoirs. This has implications for coinfection effecting the emergence of PepMV in tomato plants (G\u00f3mez et al. 2009).",

The context of the plant hosts can effect the spread and diversity of plant viruses more than the composition of the plant host species. Competition between BYDV and CYDV was altered by changing the nutrition resources in the form of nitrogen and phosphorous for their hosts (Lacroix et al. 2014). In a B/CYDV survey in North American Pacific coast grasslands targeting three different host species (Avena fatua, Elymus glaucus, and Bromus hordeaceus) virus prevalence was determined not only by host species identity, with A. fatua having the highest prevalence and B. hordeaceus having the lowest, but also by biotic and abiotic factors, including an increase of virus prevalence with a decrease in precipitation and increase in soil nitrogen (Seabloom et al. 2010).",

Many wild plants host multiple viruses, in some cases up to seven different viruses were found co-existing in a single plant (Roossinck et al. 2010). In two studies in the United States and Costa Rica, over 50 % of the virus sequences found in wild plants belonged to three virus families: Partitiviridae, Chrysoviridae, and Totiviridae (Roossinck 2012b). These virus families, along with the Endornavirdae, have been described as persistent plant viruses (Roossinck 2010, 2015a). Most of the persistent plant viruses are double stranded RNA viruses, although the Endornaviridae are likely single-stranded RNA viruses that are isolated as replicative intermediates (Roossinck et al. 2011). Most interestingly, the persistent viruses are wholly transmitted vertically, with no known form of horizontal transmission. In fact, there is no cell-to-cell movement of persistent viruses, spreading throughout the host via cell division (Roossinck 2010, 2012a). The Partitiviridae, Endornaviridae and Chrysoviridae infect both plants and fungi, while the Totiviridae also infect fungi and protozoa. While there is no observable effect of these viruses on their hosts, there have been multiple instances of integration of some persistent viral genomes into plant and fungal genomes (Liu et al. 2010; Chiba et al. 2011). This should not be surprising given the intimate symbiotic nature of the relationship. Currently the persistent viruses are understudied and many aspects of their nature are unknown (Roossinck 2015a).",

Often, even when there are related viruses within a database, the curation is not in a state to be useful. There are few centralized databanks to store metadata collected during large biodiversity surveys, though attempts have been made. Metavir, a website service offering basic analysis of viromes, allows for viromes to be made public, and at the time of writing houses 368 different viromes from 67 different projects (Roux et al. 2014). It is unclear how these potential viruses should be treated. In a recent virus survey in Costa Rica, 60 % of the sequence reads received no hit when searched against the GenBank database (Roossinck et al. 2010). For viruses with no known relative, a cluster analysis can give structure to a population of unknown microbes, including viruses (Labont\u00e9 and Suttle 2013). While having a sequence identity for these viruses can offer some answers, the viruses ultimately need to be characterized experimentally.",

The term quasispecies refers to a single replicating population, and is an \u201cindividual\u201d that selection acts upon (Holland and Domingo 1998). Do to the many different selective pressures an RNA virus experiences (different hosts, cell tropisms, vectors, etc.), a population that is more genetically robust, having a high degree of evolvability may have a selective advantage. This means in a fitness landscape, quasispecies that have a narrow fitness peak (less robust) experience a sharp decrease in fitness due to a single mutation, and are less likely to adapt rapidly to a new environment. Conversely, those with a wide fitness peak (more robust) will experience a small change in fitness, allowing for multiple mutations to accumulate for selection to act upon. This is known as the survival of the flattest (Wilke 2005).",

However, in coronaviruses it is clear that error correction can occur (Denison et al. 2011). The quasispecies is effected by not only the mutation rate of the RdRp, but also by the mode of replication, logrithmic or stamping machine (Safari and Roossinck 2014). While double-stranded RNA viruses replicate predominantly by the stamping machine method, the mode of replication of other RNA viruses is not clear. Although the mutation rate of RNA viruses are high, the level of variation within the quasispecies may be lower than expected (Garc\u00eda-Arenal et al. 2003). This is due to both positive and negative selection; however, defective genomes are often carried in the population and can provide extended function in some cases. While there are significant genetic bottleneck during systemic infection (Li and Roossinck 2004), as well as vector transmission (Ali and Roossinck 2010), viruses probably recover their diversity rapidly.",

            "text": "Recombination is not only an important part of population variation, but also can be used as a repair mechanism, balancing the high mutation rate of RNA viruses (Nagy and Simon 1997). Recombination is a frequent occurrence in CaMV, with over 50 % of isolates being recombinants after only 21 days of infection (Froissart et al. 2005). RNA 3 of bromoviruses may contain recombination hotspots (Bruyere et al. 2000). While recombination is an important part of increasing the variation of a species, recombination events that lead to hybrid proteins are most likely less fit than recombinants between whole genes or protein domains (Bonnet et al. 2005). Recombination offers a path for the adaptation of viruses to a new environment as seen with the introduction of TYLCV into Spain (Garc\u00eda-Andr\u00e9s et al. 2007). Interestingly, it appears the eukaryotic hosts may have adapted a method for modulating or regulating the degree of recombination of their infecting viruses. In a yeast model system modified to allow infection by Tomato bushy stunt virus, XRN1, a host exoribonuclease, was found to degrade 5\u2032 truncated viral RNA. These truncated RNAs are substrates for recombination (Cheng et al. 2006). Recombination is commonly found in the ssDNA geminiviruses, both within and between different species (Padidam et al. 1999; Pag\u00e1n and Holmes 2010). Citrus tristeza virus (CTV, Closteroviridae) is interesting in that many strains of the virus are commonly found within a single host plant. These strains have been phylogenetically analyzed to elucidate their evolutionary history, and it can be inferred that the current diversity of CTV was influenced by the original ancestral diversification, selection pressure of genes between and within strains, and significant recombination among strains (Harper 2013).",

In general, recombination frequencies are high in RNA viruses, and hot spots for recombination have been identified that result in exchanges between related RNA molecules, or in deletions leading to defective RNAs. In the cucumoviruses experimental infections with interspecific reassortants have frequently led to recombinants in RNA 3, where the 3\u2032 end is exchanged with that of RNA 2, presumably to establish a minus strand promoter that is cognizant with the replicase (Aaziz and Tepfer 1999; deWispelaer et al. 2005; Pita and Roossinck 2013a). In a recent study different strains of CMV had very different frequencies of recombination. Interestingly, the high recombination strain was the same strain that had low mutation frequency, and the 2a protein that encodes the RdRp was responsible for both phenotypes (Pita et al. 2015).",

The origins of RNA viruses are thought come directly from the ancient RNA world, a time before cellular life, where RNA replicated itself without a DNA phase (Bernhardt 2012). It was proposed three decades ago that animal and plant viruses have a common ancestor, likely an insect virus (Goldbach 1986). Specific motifs in virus hallmark genes (genes which are unique to viruses and are found across many families of viruses) such as the RdRp were analyzed for similarity across a wide range of animal and plant RNA viruses, with positive, negative, and double-stranded genomes. Motifs in both the positive and double-stranded RNA viruses suggests that these groups are monophyletic, with the negative strand RNA viruses less likely to be monophyletic (Koonin et al. 2015). Virus hallmark genes are shared with other selfish genetic elements, such as plasmids and transposons, suggesting that viruses have a deep lineage, which some suggest dates to a pre-cellular time (Koonin and Dolja 2014). One can think of viruses as both an organism and a mobile genetic element, much as light can be thought of as both a particle and a wave. These entities evolve within their environment, and then move as genetic elements through higher organisms (Forterre and Prangishvili 2013). Indeed examples of viral elements being incorporated into their host\u2019s genome can be found across all of the tree of life (Katzourakis 2012).",

Within the luteoviruses, recombination is often seen near the gene borders of the RdRp and the coat protein (CP) genes but rarely within genes. This suggests that the genetic histories of these genes are independent of each other (Pag\u00e1n and Holmes 2010). Phylogenetic analysis of CMV genes implies that each of the viruses three RNA segments have unique histories (Roossinck 2002). The extent of movement of genetic material across viruses can be seen with the recently named Amalgaviridae, a double-stranded RNA monopartite virus with 2 open reading frames, an RdRp and another gene. The RdRp most closely resembles that of another double-stranded RNA virus family, the Partitiviridae, while the other gene resembles that of the nucleoprotein of negative-stranded RNA viruses of the Bunyaviridae family (Krupovic et al. 2015). The iconic movement protein common and unique to plant viruses, may have been originally derived from the structural proteins used in the formation of the plasmodesmata (Lucas and Wolf 1993).",

It is extremely difficult to extract preserved viral nucleic acid from more than a few decades ago, though it is possible (Roossinck, unpublished results). Because of this difficulty, these rare integration events can be used to elucidate the life histories of the virus. Long before so many virus sequences were found in genomes, geminivirus sequences were found within the Nicotiana genome (Bejarano et al. 1996). Begomoviruses have been described as being Old world or New world, with several distinct qualities associated with each group. Most notably, the New world begomoviruses are monopartite while the Old world are bipartite. Using the intergration events within Nicotiana, an estimate of 20\u201330 MYA was found for the Old/New world split, suggesting that this virus crossed the Beringian land bridge (Lefeuvre et al. 2011). Cooperation of viruses in mixed infections may be the initial step towards multipartiate viruses. Two different monopartite viruses are known to cooperate, using each other\u2019s proteins for their own function. If the relationship of the two viruses becomes too dependent, essential gene loss can occur in one or both viruses that may remain viable due to the complementary gene of the other virus. This will eventually lead to merging the two species into a single species (Shirogane et al. 2013).",

Some ZYMV lineages have been shown to be no older than 800 years old, suggesting that humans had a role to play in there movement and diversification (Simmons et al. 2008). Lueteoviridae diversification happened in three stages; The luteo/polerovirus split estimated at 2000 years ago, diversification of each genus estimated at 1000\u20135000 years ago, and the diversification of the species within the past 300 years (Pag\u00e1n and Holmes 2010). The knowledge gained from extensive sampling including wild samples give us more insight into the life histories of viruses (Wylie et al. 2008). Potyviruses have a large amount of diversity within and between their species. Yam mosaic virus (YMV) is thought to have been originated in Africa. High levels of recombination are found within natural populations of YMV (Bousalem et al. 2000). The endogenization of Caulimoviruses distantly related to Rice tungro bacciliform virus into the rice genome have given us insight into the family\u2019s evolutionary history. The edongenization events occured before the divergence of the domestic rice progenitor Oryza rufipogon, placing this event at about 160,000 years ago (Chen et al. 2014).",

While the majority of viruses infecting crops cause disease, it appears that viruses in natural areas are neutral or may provide some small benefit to their hosts. This paradigm shift opens the door to many future applications, as well as exciting implications to the field of virology as a whole. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of movement across the agro-eco boundary, as well as an increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus evolution, may provide us with methods of predicting future epidemics, or attenuating the outbreak of new crop pathogens. The modern era of genomics is revealing new and exciting areas of research into virus evolution, and studies on the origins of viruses will likely lead to an understanding of the very origins of life on earth.",

At the agro-eco boundary viruses may move into crop plants from nearby wild plants. In most cases these infections will be dead-end: either the virus is not competent for further transmission in the new host, it may not establish sufficient virus titer to allow transmission, or it may rapidly kill the host. Rarely, a spillover virus may develop the ability to be further transmitted to more similar hosts, resulting in an emerging virus infection",
