Blood group substances A, B, O, Lewis, I, and i antigens, and their precursors and structural derivatives were specially included. These complex carbohydrates are covalently attached to cellular proteins by either O- or N-glycosylation linkages as protein posttranslational modifications or linked to a membrane-bound lipid molecule. Therefore, scanning the antibody fingerprints of immunized or infected subjects using this glycan array is a specific immunologic approach to exploring the evidence of viral expression of corresponding complex carbohydrates.",

Previous investigations have identified a complex carbohydrate of ASOR, which is composed of the tri- and tetra-antennary oligosaccharides containing Gal\u03b21,4GlcNAc-linked units at the nonreducing end (12, 13). The Gal\u03b21,4GlcNAc sugar moiety is a core element of the blood group substance-related complex carbohydrates, being referred as type II sugar structures (17). There was no detectable antibody reactivity to agalacto-orosomucoid (AGOR), a degalactosyl derivative of ASOR, which differs from ASOR solely by the absence of the terminal galactosyl sugar residue. Therefore, the observed anti-ASOR antibody reactivity is likely specific for the sugar moieties of ASOR, and the terminal galactose (Gal) contributes significantly to the carbohydrate binding reactivity.",

Results illustrated in Fig. 2 showed that lectin PHA-L (Fig. 2B) but not GS-1 (Fig. 2D) positively stained the SARS-CoV-infected cells. Neither PHA-L (Fig. 2A) nor GS-1 (Fig. 2B) stained the uninfected cells under the same conditions. The staining specificity of PHA-L was further examined by a competition assay, whereby either ASOR (Fig. 2F) or AGOR (Fig. 2E) was applied as free inhibitor to compete with the binding. Only ASOR blocked completely the PHA-L staining of the SARS-CoV-infected cells. These results demonstrate that PHA-L recognition of SARS-CoV-infected cells is specific for the carbohydrate structures that share antigenic similarity with a complex carbohydrate of ASOR.",

ASOR is an abundant human serum glycoprotein, and the ASOR-type complex carbohydrates are also expressed by other host glycoproteins (3, 10). Thus the human immune system is generally nonresponsive to these \u201cself\u201d carbohydrate structures. However, when similar sugar moieties were expressed by a viral glycoprotein, their cluster configuration could differ significantly from those displayed by a cellular glycan, thereby generating a novel \u201cnon-self\u201d antigenic structure. A documented example of such antigenic structure is a broad-range HIV-1 neutralization epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody 2G12. This antibody is specific for a unique cluster of sugar chains displayed by the gp120 glycoprotein of HIV-1 (1). It is, thus, important to examine whether naturally occurring SARS-CoV expresses the ASOR-type autoimmune reactive sugar moieties. During a SARS epidemic spread, the viruses replicate in human cells. Their sugar chain expression may differ from the monkey cell-produced viral particles. Scanning of the serum antibodies of SARS patients using glycan arrays or other specific immunologic tools may provide information to clarify this question.",

Antigen preparations spotted on each glycan array and their array location are summarized in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2 (available at the Physiological Genomics web site). Microarray images were captured using a ScanArray 5000 Standard BioChip Scanning System (GSI Lumonics, and Packard BioChip Technologies). Methods for carbohydrate microarray construction, array staining, image capturing, and data processing were described in our previous publications (14, 16). A and B: glycan array I contains 51 antigens, and each antigen was printed at 0.5 mg/ml (\u223c0.5 ng/microspot) without further dilution. This array was applied to scan horse anti-Pn18 antiserum (A), as well as anti-SARS neutralizing antibodies (B). One microliter of each antiserum was applied to stain corresponding glycan array at 1:100 dilution in 1% BSA (wt/vol) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.05% (wt/vol) Tween 20 and 0.025% (wt/vol) NaN3. The horse IgG antibodies captured by glycan arrays were visualized and quantified by using a rabbit anti-horse IgGFITC antibody. Locations of autoantigen ASOR were marked with an arrow key in each stained glycan array. The levels of IgG antibodies in the SARS-CoV vaccinated horse, as measured by the mean values of the fluorescence intensity minus background signal, are 9,043 and 1,494 for ASOR (B, coordinate D7) and agalacto-orosomucoid (AGOR) (B, coordinate D8), respectively. In the Streptococcus pneumoniae type 18 polysaccharide (Pn18) immunized horse, the values of anti-ASOR and anti-AGOR IgG activities are 448 (A, coordinate D7) and 501 (A, coordinate D8), respectively. This anti-ASOR-carbohydrate antibody reactivity was confirmed by multiple bioarray assays, as well as an antigen-specific ELISA assay (data not shown). C and D: glycan array II displays 24 antigens and was enriched with preparations of Gal-containing carbohydrate antigens. The initial antigen spotting concentration for glycan array II is 0.5 mg/ml (\u223c0.5 ng/microspot). These were further diluted at 1:3, 1:9, and 1:27. A panel of monoclonal antibodies and lectins with anti-carbohydrate activities were scanned using glycan array II. Two examples were shown in C and D. They were stained with corresponding biotinylated lectins at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml. Streptavidin-Cy5 conjugate was applied to reveal specific staining signal. A: image of glycan array I stained by a horse antiserum elicited by Pn18 polysaccharide. This antibody preparation was adopted from the late Professor Elvin A. Kabat of Columbia University. B: image of glycan array I stained by a preparation of horse anti-SARS-CoV antisera. The antisera were prepared by J. Lu\u2019s laboratory in the School of Public Health of Sun Yat-sen University, China. C: image of glycan array II stained by lectin PHA-L (Phaseolus vulgaris-L) staining. This lectin is specific for the tri- and tetra-antennary oligosaccharides containing Gal\u03b21,4GlcNAc-linked units at nonreducing end (2). D: image of glycan array II stained by lectin GS-1-B4 (Griffonia simplicifolia I-B4 agglutinin). This lectin was considered to be highly specific for Gal\u03b11,3Gal, a xentogenic epitope of porcine tissues (17). Distance between adjacent microspots is 375 \u03bcm, center to center.",

This array contains both SARS-CoV-infected Vero (Vero E6) cells and uninfected Vero cells and has been treated with a disinfecting fixing agent and was gamma-irradiated to inactivate infectious virus particles while preserving antigenic structures of SARS-CoV to ensure the test\u2019s diagnostic sensitivity. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described (16). This experiment demonstrated that lectin PHA-L stained the SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells, whereas GS-1 did not. In addition, the PHA-L staining was completely blocked by ASOR. In contrast, AGOR did not inhibit the staining at the same concentration (50 \u03bcg/ml). A and C: noninfected Vero cells. B and D\u2013F: SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. A and B: PHA-LBI (0.5 \u03bcg/ml)/avidinFITC. C and D: GS-1BI (0.5 g/ml)/avidinFITC.
