Infection of HCWs during a pandemic is of public health concern not only because of the impact of infection and illness on the HCWs themselves but also because HCWs have frequent contact with patients who could be predisposed to serious illness if infected with influenza, and substantial rates of absenteeism among HCWs could have adverse effects on the healthcare system.1 In 2009 the Institute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that all healthcare workers who would have contact with suspected or confirmed pH1N1 patients should use N95 respirators. Recommended practice in Hong Kong followed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines under which surgical masks should be routinely worn by all healthcare workers, standard droplet precautions should be implemented during contact with influenza patients, and greater precautions including face shields and N95 respirators used when performing aerosol-generating procedures.2\n",

A titre of \u22651:40 was taken as the threshold for seropositivity because in a previous study conducted in the same laboratory around 90% of patients with confirmed infection reached a titre of \u22651:40 by VN at convalescence8 whereas few individuals had a titre \u22651:40 by VN before the first pandemic wave.

One study reported higher prevalence of pH1N1 antibody in HCWs in Taiwan compared with that the general community, although age was strongly associated with seroprevalence, and age distributions differed between the HCW and community samples, possibly explaining the differences in seroprevalence.12 Infection control procedures in Hong Kong followed the WHO guidelines. It is likely that the guidelines for the appropriate use of personal protective equipment were stringently adhered to following previous experiences with severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 as well as intensive control efforts from dedicated infection control teams.2 Although we did not collect detailed data on adherence to infection control measures, another study reported that failure to comply with standard precautions such as wearing a surgical mask during contact with suspected influenza patients was associated with an increased risk of pH1N1 infection.2\n",

Younger HCWs were more likely to have antibody titre \u22651:40, consistent with higher population attack rates in younger age groups,4 although potentially confounded by differences in age-specific ability to mount antibody response to infection. As the first point of contact with most influenza patients in a hospital setting is the emergency room, it is plausible that HCWs in the emergency room could face the highest and most frequent risk of infection \u2013 even though many patients with influenza-like illness are not admitted.

Around 15% of HCWs in our study reported receipt of one dose of pH1N1 vaccine, compared with overall vaccine coverage of around 10% of HCWs in Hong Kong.

First, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study following the first pH1N1 wave, and we did not have baseline (pre-pandemic) data to enable us to infer accurately attack rates among HCWs. Analysis of serological data may misclassify the infection status of some individuals. However, few adults in Hong Kong had antibody to pH1N1 at titre of \u22651:40 prior to the first wave (Table III),4 whereas most individuals infected with pH1N1 did go on to develop antibody titres \u22651:40.5 Second, although we did not observe any substantial excess risk of pH1N1 infection in HCWs compared with the general community, it is possible that a smaller excess risk did exist but may have been masked by community exposures in our study. Larger and more detailed studies of HCWs are certainly warranted to help understand the risk of nosocomial infection and the effectiveness of preventive measures. Third, participants in our study were a convenience sample covering HCWs in both acute and non-acute hospitals; a random sample would have been ideal albeit more difficult to implement with a high response rate. Finally, we recruited HCWs who were working in six public hospitals on Hong Kong island and our results may not generalise to HCWs working in other regions of Hong Kong or local private hospitals and outpatient clinics.",
