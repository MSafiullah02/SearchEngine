In 1900, when Soseki Natsume, a Japanese writer, was in London, the mean life span of the male population in England was 44 years old and that in Japan was 45 years old. In many countries, the mean life span has increased steadily during 70 years after the Second World War; i.e., elongation of life span was more than 30 years in Japan. This pronounced elongation of life span is attributed to rapid progress of medicine including antibiotics and sufficient food supply including proteins.",

We have been studying the immunological aspect of aging for many years and have confirmed that immune functions are susceptible to aging, diseases, and stress. For the past 50 years, many studies including ours have shown that the age-related decline mainly occurs in T cell-dependent immune functions (Makinodan and Kay 1980; Hirokawa 1992; Linton and Dorshkind 2004; Hirokawa et al. 2006; Fulop et al. 2013; Nikolich-Zugich 2014). As to innate immunity, the considerable functional and phenotypical alterations with age were reported (Hazeldine and Lord 2015). However, the age-related alteration starting from thymic involution is so dramatic that we focused on parameters that are related with T cell-dependent functions.",

Since it is difficult to imagine the immunological level of each individual by merely looking at the values of the eight parameters, we have tried to express the immunological level of each individual in a plain style. The value of each immunological parameter falls within a range specified in a database and each parameter was scored into three grades based on its value. In particular, values in the range of a cumulative frequency less than 10% of values observed for healthy subject were scored 1, which indicates a low immunity level; those between 10% and 40% were scored 2, which indicates a moderate immunity level; and those with 40% or higher were scored 3, which indicates a sufficiently high immunity level. Since higher scores of CD4/CD8 ratios are frequently observed in very old people and patients suffering from diseases, values between 80% and 90% of the cumulative frequency were scored 2 and those higher than 90% were scored 1. The database was obtained from approximately 500 normal healthy population ranging in age from 20 to 90 years. Immunological level of each individual was obtained by summation of 8 scores. This value was then classified into 5 grades; i.e., immunological score 15/24 was allotted to II/V, warning zone as shown in Fig. 2.",

There are four types of number and proliferative capacity of T cells. (1) Both parameters are sufficient; (2) number is sufficient, but proliferative capacity is insufficient; (3) number is insufficient and proliferative capacity is sufficient; and (4) both are insufficient.

Unfortunately, however, most stresses are unavoidable. But it is worthwhile to reconsider the cause of stress and analyze whether or not it is avoidable.Alleviate stress.It is interesting to note that the same level of stress has very serious effects in some people, but not in others.

The decline of immune function is one of the major aging phenomena and constitutes the background of various diseases occurring in the elderly people (Hirokawa et al. 1998). Many investigators assume that oxidative stresses play an important role in the progression of immunological decline during the course of aging (Martin et al. 1996; Meydani et al. 1998). Thus, it has been expected that enzymes or substances that compete with oxidative stress are candidates for antiaging medicines. Antioxidant enzymes are present in our body, e.g., SOD and catalase. It is possible to enhance the production of these antioxidant enzymes by appropriate physical exercise. In addition, there are many kinds of supplements that are commercially available as antioxidant chemicals, although effectiveness of most of them has not been proved scientifically.",

The mice had been gonadectomized 1 month before the sacrifice, and the magnitude of thymic regeneration was more pronounced in males than in females (Fig. 12). However, enhancement of anti-SRBC antibody response was observed only in females but not in males regardless of age. Gonadectomy brought about not only thymic hypertrophy but also an increase in T cells and B cells in the spleen. An increase in T cell subpopulations was proportional in female mice, but disproportional in male. The disproportional increase of T cell subpopulations could account for the failure to enhance the anti-SRBC antibody response in male mice (Utsuyama and Hirokawa 1989).",

Activation of the immune functions occurred in both males and females by administration of GHRH (Khorram et al. 1997; Koo et al. 2001). Since elderly people frequently have occult carcinoma in thyroid, prostate, and other organs, we need to consider the possibility that an increased level of growth hormone may stimulate proliferation of tumor cells, giving rise to the clinical manifestation of the occult carcinoma (Peryy et al. 2006). Another important information is a kind of trade-off situation between thymus and GH (Hirokawa et al. 2016). GH is necessary for the development of thymus dependent immune system, but in the later life GH deficiency is favorable for long life span and decreased occurrence of cancer and diabetes mellitus. ",

The results suggest that intrinsic cellular change of the immune system is more responsible for the immune deficiencies in the aged than the environmental or structural tissue changes including connective tissues and humoral factors. In thymus grafting, however, thymic stromal tissues rather than thymocytes are important for the restoration of T cell-dependent immune system. For human application, the transplantation of bone-marrow cells is becoming easier, but it is almost impossible to find donors of young thymuses. Further, donors need to have the same MHC type as the recipients. Thymus transplantation may be performed, if an autologous thymus can be partially removed at a young age and stored in liquid nitrogen.",

The mice were sacrificed 11 days and 25 days after the infusion of activated T cells and used for immunological assessment. For the infusion of activated T cells, splenic lymphocytes were expanded 10- to 15-folds in the presence of immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and IL-2. Lymphocytes activated in this way were composed of mostly T cells in which approximately 70% to 80% were CD8+ T cells and 7\u201314% were CD4+ T cells.

In the peripheral blood and spleen, donor-type Thy-1.1 T cells were significantly more numerous in old recipients than in young ones.

For this purpose, we have developed an immunological scoring system using nearly ten immunological parameters. In other words, instead of a list of several values of immunological parameters, simple numeral of immunological score or grade can tell us level immunological function as a whole. T cell proliferation index (TCPI) is a new immunological parameter calculated by number of T cells and T cell-proliferative activity. As TCPI is negatively correlated with chronological age, it is possible to obtain immunological age by using correlation formula. The number of CD8+CD28+ T cells is also negatively correlated with chronological age. T lymphocyte age is calculated by using the correlation formula between the number of CD8+CD28+ T cells and chronological age. For those who are not familiar with the immune system, it is relatively easy to guess the level of immunological vigor from the immunological age and T lymphocyte age. The immunological age is well correlated with T lymphocyte age. But as an individual level, some difference is observed between them.",
