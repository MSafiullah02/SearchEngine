Two studies of critically-ill patients demonstrated that 23% (n = 12) of patients developed cardiac injury [29] and 33% (n = 7) of patients developed a cardiomyopathy [34] .

One study showed that patients infected with COVID-19 who had underlying hypertension had increased odds of death (OR 3.05 [95% CI 1.57-5.92, p b .001]) compared to those without hypertension. Similarly, coronary artery disease was associated with increased odds (OR 21.4 [95% CI 4.64-98.7, p b .0001]) of death [40] . In one meta-analysis, COVID-19 patients with hypertension had a relative risk ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.54-2.68, p b .00001) of having severe disease/ requiring ICU care compared to those without hypertension. Patients with coronary artery disease/cerebrovascular disease had a relative risk ratio of 3.3 (95% CI 2.03-5.36, p b .00001) of having severe disease/requiring ICU care compared to those without cardiovascular disease [41] . When analyzing the largest case series to date (44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases), the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that patients with cardiovascular disease had a case fatality rate of 10.5% and those with hypertension had a case fatality rate of 6%, both of which were higher than the overall case fatality rate of 2.3% [39] (Fig. 2) . Patients with hypertension accounted for 13% of the COVID-19 cases but they comprised 32% of the COVID-19 deaths. Patients with cardiovascular disease made up 4.2% of the COVID-19 cases, but were responsible for 18.3% of the COVID-19 deaths ( [42] , Fig. 2 ). This may be due to the fact that patients with history of coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes may have reduced or impaired cardiovascular functional reserve, and the COVID-19 infection may either precipitate a myocardial infarction (type 1 myocardial infarction), increase myocardial demand leading to worsening ischemia and necrosis (type 2 myocardial infarction), or increase metabolic demand that leads to heart failure and death [43] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 50, "end": 54, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 413, "end": 417, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 418, "end": 422, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 423, "end": 427, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 428, "end": 431, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 432, "end": 435, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 750, "end": 754, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1188, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1546, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1801, "end": 1805, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2271, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1547, "end": 1555, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1814, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "COVID-19 and adult patients with cardiovascular disease"}, {"text": "There is a case series of patients with heart transplants and COVID-19 infection [44] .

Proper isolation measures should be taken and providers should wear appropriate personal protective equipment, regardless of the diagnostic test. It should be noted that there are cases of negative initial testing that later repeated as positive, as this may be due to low viral titers early in the infection. One shocking reality is that in many countries, including Western nations like the United States, lack widespread testing capability. At the time of the writing of this manuscript in the third week of March 2020, testing in Los Angeles is woefully unavailable for the vast majority of potentially infected patients.

Certain adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are likely at higher risk than others. Based on the ACHD Anatomy and Physiological Stage Classification, any patient with complex congenital heart disease (Anatomy Stage III) or Physiological Stage B, C, or D symptoms could be considered high risk for complications related to COVID-19 infection on the basis of decreased functional reserve [50] (Table 2) . Those with reduced immunity, including Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome and asplenia may be at even higher risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19 infection.

The advent of wearable technology and wide availability of blood pressure, heart rate, and oximetry equipment for home use can be a reasonable substitute for in-clinic vital sign measurements. Additionally, the video function can allow a clinician to inspect the patient visually, albeit in a far less comprehensive manner when compared to the traditional physical examination. Hand-held and easily sterilized echocardiographic equipment can also be a 'handy' substitute for traditional comprehensive echocardiography, and the inevitably higher rate of exposure in a frequently visited echo lab.
