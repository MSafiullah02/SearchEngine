The fleas have a predilection for the ears where they can be found in clusters along the edges of the pinnae. The fleas are mobile and move between the environment and the host. Wild rabbit fleas are not usually found on pet rabbits. Spilopsyllus cuniculi is a small flea whose life cycle is influenced by the reproductive status of the host. Egg maturation is dependent on female reproductive hormones. Successful reproduction of the rabbit flea requires contact with a rabbit in late pregnancy or with a newborn nestling. Increased blood corticosteroid concentrations in late pregnancy attract fleas, which attach firmly to the doe to feed. Within a few hours of parturition, fleas move from the doe to the newborn babies to feed, copulate and lay eggs in the nest. The eggs hatch and the larvae feed on flea dirt deposited in the nest by the adult fleas feeding on the pregnant doe. In this way, fleas are spread from one generation to the next and are an important vector of disease, especially myxomatosis.",

Athymic mice do not develop a cellular or humoral response to the parasite and masses of spores are found in the liver and other viscera (Gannon, 1980). E. cuniculi has been recognized as an opportunistic pathogen in human patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in which it can cause interstitial pneumonitis, diarrhoea and wasting (Deplazes et al., 1996; Joste et al., 1996). Experimental infection of rabbits with E. cuniculi cultures administered into the rectum with a catheter after weeks of repeated colonic enemas resulted in E. cuniculi infection with hepatic lesions predominating rather than the typical brain and kidney changes (Fuentealba et al., 1992).",

Other texts describe encephalitozoonosis as a chronic, latent disease of rabbits that is significant because of its effects on experimental results. Infection with E. cuniculi in laboratory rabbits has caused many problems to scientific studies. Subclinical infection has vitiated experimental results and lesions caused by the parasite have been wrongly attributed to a number of other ailments (Wilson, 1979). Encephalitozoonosis can interfere with test results. Blood samples of rabbits with spontaneous encephalitozoonosis have been shown to have significantly lower levels of catecholamines than healthy rabbits (Levkut et al., 1997).

In laboratory rabbits, serum antibodies develop after 3 weeks and excretion of the parasite occurs 6 weeks after experimental infection with E. cuniculi (Cox et al., 1979). Passive immunity is transferred from infected dams to their offspring, which can have titres of 1:25 to 1:800 that last until they are about 4 weeks old.

In colonies that screen for the disease, affected animals are culled and in colonies that do not screen, infection can be subclinical with no obvious sign of disease. It is for the individual pet rabbit that treatment is usually sought. Observant owners may notice clinical signs that would be overlooked in the colony situation and are reluctant to have their animals euthanased. Several treatment protocols have been suggested based either on basic principles of therapy for granulomatous encephalitis or on in vitro susceptibility of E. cuniculi organisms to various therapeutic agents. Some cases appear to improve spontaneously without treatment, presumably due to the host's immune response. In the absence of a simple diagnostic test for the presence of the antigen in the live animal, it is difficult to monitor the efficacy of therapeutic agents in eliminating the parasite. Antibody titres have been used as a guide to the progress of the disease but controlled studies are needed to evaluate their significance as prognostic indicators. Clinical signs are not only associated with the presence of the parasite but also the associated inflammatory response that persists after the organism is eliminated. Some data have been obtained from the treatment of AIDS patients who are able to describe their symptoms and can therefore be assessed more easily than pet rabbits. Parasite excretion has been monitored using PCR assays that are not generally available for pet rabbits. In general, E. cuniculi in pet rabbits is either treated with corticosteroids to suppress the inflammatory reaction or with albendazole or oxytetracycline, both of which kill the organism in vitro.",

            "text": "In common with all mammals, rabbits can be infected with Toxoplasma gondii although infection is usually subclinical. Ingested sporulated oocysts hatch in the duodenum. Sporozoites invade neighbouring cells and are dispersed throughout the body via the blood and lymphatics. Once the host immune responses are established, the organisms can be found as cysts in various tissues where they can remain for years (Owen, 1992). The source of infection for rabbits is feed contaminated by cat faeces and symptoms have been described in rabbits that grazed an area frequented by cats. Clinical signs are most common in the acute phase in young rabbits. Sudden anorexia, pyrexia and death are the usual signs, although CNS symptoms such as posterior paralysis or seizures can also occur (Leland et al., 1992). Outbreaks have been described in commercial rabbits (1Harcourt, 1967; Okerman, 1988). High antibody titres have been found in wild rabbits collected from sewerage farms in Australia (Cox et al., 1981). Positive serology only indicates exposure to infection. Gustaffson et al. (1997) compared the difference in susceptibility to toxoplasmosis between two lagomorphs; the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) and the domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Domestic rabbits were found to be resistant to toxoplasmosis in comparison with the mountain hare. In the mountain hare, toxoplasmosis is acutely fatal and characterized by necrosis and tissue damage in the small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver. In the domestic rabbit, lesions are mild consisting of focal accumulations of mononuclear cells, mainly in the liver and heart. Histopathology is diagnostic. Antibodies are detected early as 7-8 days post-infection (Gustaffson et al., 1997).",

Vestibular disease is the most commonly recognized manifestation\u2022Multiplication of spores within infected cells takes place until, eventually, the cell ruptures releasing spores that can invade neighbouring cells\u2022Cell rupture is associated with an inflammatory response and the development of granulomas\u2022In the kidney, spores are released into the urine to infect other animals\u2022\nE. cuniculi is uncommon in wild rabbits. It can affect other mammals and birds, especially if they are immunosuppressed. Serological studies have demonstrated antibodies to E. cuniculi in dogs\u2022\nE. cuniculi is potentially zoonotic although there are no reports of infections in healthy individuals. Immunosuppressed humans such as AIDS patients are susceptible\u2022An antibody response occurs in rabbits and infected animals become immune. Serological testing can be used to detect exposure to infection\u2022\nE. cuniculi is susceptible to a range of drugs in vitro. Albendazole has been used to treat human patients with success in eliminating the parasite\u2022Albendazole is available and safe for use in rabbits although there are no data available at the present time about its efficacy. Dosage and duration of treatment is empirical. It is indicated to limit spread of infection to other rabbits\u2022Oxytetracycline has been used to treat encephalitozoonosis in rabbits\u2022Toxoplasmosis is rare in rabbits, but does occasionally occur\u2022Although toxoplasmosis is potentially zoonotic, toxoplasma is only transmissable from rabbits to humans who handle or eat undercooked rabbit meat.

Many laboratory colonies are now disease free and are vigilantly barrier-housed to prevent the introduction of infection. Pasteurella-free stock is selected by placing rabbits in isolation for 2-4 weeks and repeatedly culturing the nasal passages. Rabbits with positive cultures or signs of rhinitis are culled. Surviving rabbits are bred from and after 3 years, the colony is considered to be disease free. Other methods of producing disease-free rabbits involve caesarean derivation with hand-rearing (Manning et al., 1989) or the transfer of fertilized ova to Pasteurella-free does. Early weaning and the use of antibiotics can increase the number of disease-free stock. To ensure an uninfected status, periodic serological testing for antibodies to pasteurella is necessary. Recently a polymerase chain reaction test has been developed that can be used to detect infection (Sanchez et al., 2000).",

The bacterial genome is closely related to Clostridium species and, in recent years, the organism has been reclassified as Clostridium piliforme rather than Bacillus piliformis (Besch-Williford, 1997). Tyzzer's disease can affect a wide range of animals including rodents, cats and monkeys (Delong and Manning, 1994). The disease affects the caecum, intestine and liver causing acute diarrhoea and sudden death in the acute stage and intestinal fibrosis, stenosis and liver necrosis in chronic cases. The myocardium can also be affected. The disease usually occurs in weanling rabbits 6-12 weeks old but can occur at any age and is often predisposed by stress. Recent advances in tissue culture have led to development of diagnostic tests and serological testing is now possible in some countries. The presence of antibody in apparently healthy animals suggests latent infection of the intestinal tract. Stress or immunosuppression can precipitate overt disease (Delong and Manning, 1994). Transmission occurs by ingestion of spores that can survive in the environment for some time after an infected animal has been removed. Overcrowding, stress, low dietary fibre and transport predispose to clinical disease. Supportive treatment and antibiotic therapy are generally unrewarding.",

Two years later, in 1954, the rabbit population was as large as ever despite the considerable mortality that resulted from myxomatosis (Fenner and Fantani, 1999). Although there were efforts to eradicate myxomatosis in the UK, the disease spread rapidly through the wild rabbit population in the summer of 1953 and was endemic by the late 1950s. The attitude to myxomatosis in the UK was different from other parts of the world. Rabbits were frequently kept as pets and there was outcry at the sight of blind, sick rabbits stumbling along roads or on commons and other public places. As a result, in 1954, it became an offence knowingly to use or permit the use of an infected rabbit to spread the disease into an uninfected population. This law was difficult to enforce.",

In the UK, disease outbreaks tend to remain localized with isolated pockets of infection and the disease is only sporadically encountered in pet rabbits. The difference in epidemiology is attributed to the difference in the life cycle of insect vectors. In the UK, the European rabbit flea, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, is the major insect vector rather than mosquito species Aedes and Anopheles spp. Even in the absence of the host, fleas can maintain infectivity throughout the winter and act as a reservoir of infection for the following year.

The disease starts with a skin lesion, which typically develops 4-5 days after inoculation of the virus and enlarges to become about 3 cm in diameter 9-10 days after infection. The rabbit is viraemic, with virus replication taking place throughout the lymphoid system. The eyelids become thickened and eventually the eyes are completely closed by the ninth day with a semipurulent ocular discharge. Secondary lesions develop throughout the body, typically on the nares, lips, eyelids and base of the ears and on the external genitalia and anus. Aerosol infection can result in pneumonic signs, which is a feature of outbreaks in intensive farmed rabbits.

Apart from the virulence of the virus strain, certain environmental factors affect the resistance of the rabbit to myxomatosis, i.e. intercurrent infection and environmental temperature. Ambient temperature affects the course of the disease with high environmental temperature increasing recovery rate (85\u00b0C). Antibiotics, a warm environment and good nursing can be successful and some pet rabbits have survived myxomatosis although their chances are not good. The risk of secondary problems such as gastrointestinal stasis or pasteurellosis is ever present. Non-steroidal analgesics are useful but the use of corticosteroids is contraindicated due to their immunosuppressive effects. Opioid analgesics do not appear to be effective in ameliorating signs of pain. In a study of the effect of buprenorphine on the course of myxomatosis in laboratory rabbits, there was no difference in survival time. Treated rabbits refused food and water a day earlier than untreated rabbits and had lower rectal temperatures immediately prior to death (Robinson et al., 1999).",

Infected young rabbits survive and become immune so when the disease becomes endemic the morbidity and mortality rate falls. In wild rabbits, the disease appears to break out every second year. Insects mechanically transmit the virus in viraemic blood from one animal to another. VHD virus can survive for several weeks in carcasses and skin. Fleas, blowflies and mosquitoes are known to spread the disease (Fenner and Fantani, 1999). PCR techniques have shown that virus can be retained in the body of blowflies for up to 9 days and bushflies for 7 days. Fly \u2018spots\u2019 (faeces) are also infective and can contaminate pasture. Flies can travel long distances and be carried along by the wind and spread the disease far and wide. It has also been demonstrated that domestic and wild carnivores can play an important role in the epidemiology of VHD since virulent material can be collected from faecal material after experimental oral inoculation. The virus is very stable in carcasses even after freezing and thawing (Lumeij, 1997). Up until October 1996, VHD was a notifiable disease in Great Britain. It is now endemic and poses a real threat to the pet rabbit due to its resistance and ease of transmission. Deaths have been reported nationwide that have been confirmed at post-mortem to be due to VHD.",

Acute cases are quiet, pyrexic with an increased respiratory rate and usually die within 12 h.

Haematuria, haemorrhagic vaginal discharges or foamy exudate from the nostrils may be seen. Vascular infarcts can occur within the brain and occasionally convulsions or other neurological signs are seen just before death. Agonal vocalizing and cyanosis have been described (Donnelly, 1995).

The liver is enlarged, friable and pale with a distinct lobular pattern (see Plate 35). The spleen is also enlarged. Haemorrhages can be found in any organ but are usually present in the lung. The trachea is often full of a foamy exudate. Haematologically, there are fibrin thrombi, lymphopaenia, a reduction in platelets and a failure of other blood clotting factors that result in multiple organ failure due to general circu latory dysfunction. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a characteristic feature of the pathogenesis of VHD (Chasey, 1997). Histopathology confirms acute hepatic necrosis. There may be many other changes such as acute nephropathy or alveolar haemorrhage. Congestion and haemorrhages can occur in any organ due to terminal intravascular coagulation. The typical histopathological changes in the liver are usually diagnostic but there are a number of other tests that confirm the diagnosis, including hamagglutination tests and electron microscopy. Large numbers of characteristic calicivirus can be detected by electron microscopic examination of liver (Chasey et al., 1995). Fresh liver is required by the laboratory.

A simple method of detecting Leporacus gibbus is to comb through the fur with a fine-toothed flea comb and place the combings in a small, clear plastic bag. The contents of the bag are viewed microscopically under low power and the mites are seen moving along hair shafts. Eggs and empty egg cases can be seen attached to hair shafts. Immature and adult mites are visible. There are morphological differences between male (a) and female mites (b).",
