At that moment, the Madrid region registered 578 diagnosed patients and 17 deaths [5]. The regional authorities (in charge of healthcare and education in the Madrid area) requested from hospitals and universities to establish contingency plans. First measures were to cancel the presence of university students in the hospital, to suspend any in-person congress or meeting activity gathering more than 10 people in the hospital and university settings, and to avoid any travelling or displacement of healthcare personnel outside the hospital. A plan was put in place to progressively decrease the weekly planned scheduled surgical activity, initially suspending any extraordinary surgical activity in scheduled orthopaedic procedures. This was implemented shortening surgical lists and establishing priorities (besides trauma, joint revision surgery, tumour, infections and complications were maintained). By 10th March 2020, 1622 diagnosed cases and 35 deaths were officially recorded in Spain, while in Madrid, the report included 782 cases and 21 deaths [6].",

Even if the hospital surgical environment is safe enough when adequate isolation from Covid-19 (+) surgical theatres and wards is maintained, patients undergoing surgery should be fully aware about post-operative limitations (rehabilitation, wound care and required assistance) and risks, particularly if affected by Covid-19 and requiring isolation that may compromise the post-operative outcome.",

Hip fractures (particularly in aged patients coming from nursing home environments) and polytrauma patients were seen and operated under these special circumstances.

However, one 59-year-old female patient with severe risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) was admitted to receive surgical treatment for acute ankle fracture infection producing skin dehiscence 3 weeks after surgery. Upon admission, no Covid-19-related symptoms were identified, but 2 days later, the patient presented with dysnea, 80% O2 saturation, and fever (38.2\u00b0C). Chest X-ray confirmed bilateral bronchopneumonia, and PCR for SARS-Cov2 was deemed positive. The patient was admitted into ICU but unfortunately died 5 days upon admission. The patient did not have the chance to undergo surgery, but raised the issue of pre-operatively asymptomatic patients requiring Covid-19 assessment before surgery. Since 23rd March 2020, it was agreed that all cases undergoing surgical treatment in the orthopaedic department should undergo a pre-operative SARS-Cov2 laboratory evaluation by PCR, to clarify the appropriate surgical setting, protect the patient from unidentified risks, protect the surgical personnel and decrease the risk of treatment-related spread of Covid-19 within the surgical setting.",
