Alongside, the crisis provokes impetus for overdue change to educational and training methods that have stood their ground since the birth of hospital medicine: lectures, workshops and conferences. 1 The spread of coronavirus has left thousands of medical students stranded. All specialist training ventures are deferred. Educational and clinical meetings have been cancelled.",

Apple Inc (Cupertino, CA - USA) transformed its major annual conference, WWDC, into an online-only meeting. If this venture succeeds, it provides a template for online-only conferences in other disciplines too. Should it not, we must learn from an analysis of why it failed to work. Providing an online-only conference is a tall ask; Google LLC (Mountain View, CA - United States) canceled theirs altogether. Delivering a fully online international conference is not a challenge to be underestimated.",

Meetings of large groups within a closed environment, commuting to and from academic institutions and physical presence at close quarters are all proscribed now, to minimise the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The UK National Health Service, in the words of Andy Cowper (HSJ), has seen more progressive change in a fortnight than has been accomplished in years of stifled effort. The instigation of virtual outpatient encounters to replace unjustifiably hazardous hospital attendances is one example. How then, should we translate these developments into the domain of surgical education?",

The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) has a track record of providing both asynchronous eLearning for academic learning objectives (blended learning modules and online courses, 2012-2016) as well as synchronous e-classes (Masterclass 2019-2020). 2\n,\n3 Renowned vascular surgery conferences such as the annual Leipzig Interventional Course (LINC) regularly broadcast operative interventions in real-time, sandwiched into a full day\u2019s congress schedule \u2013 a remarkable feat of both organization and technical expertise. Some manufacturers of medical devices (e.g. W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. Newark, DE - USA) have already released novel mobile applications to address the lack of on-site support when needed. 4 However, these cutting-edge distance learning practices remain the exception, rather than the norm. The technical knowhow exists; the instructional designs are valid; the missing cog appears to be wider uptake of these training models. It is our hope that one of the lessons distilled into future practice from the coronavirus pandemic will be a greater appreciation and acceptance of digitally and remotely provided medical and surgical education.",
