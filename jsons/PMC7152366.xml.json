Peritoneal effusion is a consistent finding but may be difficult to appreciate on physical examination if only a small volume of fluid is present; it also may be difficult to detect sonographically in animals that are dehydrated. Abdominal pain may be appreciated on palpation, with a small number of dogs exhibiting the \u201cprayer position\u201d in an attempt to relieve their abdominal discomfort. Abdominal pain is a less consistent finding in feline peritonitis patients (38% to 62%).4, 10 Most animals with septic peritonitis are systemically ill and exhibit nonspecific clinical signs such as anorexia, vomiting, mental depression, and lethargy. These patients may arrive in progressive states of hypovolemic and cardiovascular shock, with either injected or pale mucous membranes, prolonged capillary refill time, tachycardia with weak pulses, and with either hyperthermia or hypothermia reflecting poor peripheral perfusion. A significant number of cats (16%) with septic peritonitis exhibited bradycardia (see Chapters 6 and 91).4 In fact, the combination of bradycardia and hypothermia in cats with primary septic peritonitis has been established as a negative prognostic indicator.1 Animals with uroperitoneum may continue to urinate with concurrent leakage into the peritoneal cavity.",

Intestinal tract obstruction or bowel plication should be ruled out. Prostatomegaly in male dogs and evidence of uterine distention in female dogs should be noted. Thoracic radiographs should be performed to rule out concurrent illness (infectious, neoplastic, or traumatic). The presence of bicavitary effusion increased the mortality rate of patients 3.3-fold compared with that of patients with peritoneal effusions alone.14 Ultrasonography may be useful for defining the underlying cause of peritonitis, in addition to its use in localizing and aiding retrieval of peritoneal effusion. In the case of a confirmed uroabdomen, preoperative contrast radiography (excretory urography or cystourethrography) is recommended to localize the site of urine leakage and aid in surgical planning.

Single paracentesis attempts are successful in only 20% of patients with low volumes of peritoneal effusion (3 ml/kg) and in only 80% with larger volumes (10 ml/kg). Ultrasonographic guidance facilitates the retrieval of smaller volumes of peritoneal fluid. If single-site sampling is negative for fluid, four-quadrant sampling should be performed.",

DPL ideally is performed using a peritoneal dialysis catheter but also can be performed using an over-the-needle, large-bore (14- to 16-gauge) catheter. The technique is performed by placing a catheter sterilely into the abdomen, infusing 22 ml/kg of a warmed, sterile isotonic saline solution, then retrieving a sample for analysis and culture and susceptibility testing. The lavage solution dilutes the sample and therefore alters the fluid analysis. A repeated DPL may increase accuracy of the technique when results of the first procedure are equivocal.",

Leukocyte morphology has been suggested to be more reliable than cell counts in diagnosing peritonitis.15 In an experimental study, DPL samples obtained before and after abdominal surgery suggest a nucleated cell count less than 1000 cells/\u00b5l (predominantly segmented neutrophils and macrophages) in dogs without intraabdominal pathology, whereas nucleated cell counts increased significantly in postoperative samples.11 In a second experimental study, DPL cell counts between 500 and 10,500 cells/\u00b5l consisting predominantly of nondegenerate neutrophils are seen within the first 3 days after uncomplicated intestinal anastomosis.15 Peritoneal leukocyte counts in animals with experimentally induced peritonitis exceed 5000 cells/\u00b5l (consistent with an exudate), with primarily degenerative neutrophils. Early in the disease process, lower cell numbers or an absence of degenerate neutrophils may occur in the face of septic peritonitis. The presence of intracellular bacteria, plant material/GI ingesta with associated inflammation, and/or free biliary crystals supports the diagnosis of peritonitis. Furthermore, increasing inflammation (numbers of neutrophils or morphologic features of toxicity in these cells) observed in serial samples and correlated with clinical findings may prove more useful than single leukocyte counts in abdominal fluid samples when deciding whether reoperation is indicated. Dogs receiving antimicrobial therapy may have no observable bacteria in peritoneal fluid samples, despite having peritoneal contamination.",

In addition, an abdominal fluid lactate concentration that is 2.0 mmol/L or greater than the blood lactate is predictive of septic peritonitis in dogs but has not been as useful in cats.16, 17 These parameters have been shown to be unreliable indicators of septic peritonitis in the evaluation of postoperative cases in which closed suction drains have been placed.18 Samples for aerobic and anaerobic cultures should be obtained at the time of initial sampling so that additional samples are not required after confirming the presence of a septic process and initiating antimicrobial therapy.",

Because significant amounts of protein are lost into the peritoneal cavity, plasma and/or albumin administration also may be warranted. Judicious fluid therapy is recommended to avoid volume overload. Electrolytes and glucose should be supplemented if indicated (see Electrolyte and Acid-Base Disturbances, Chapters 50 through 56, and Chapter 66Chapter 50Chapter 51Chapter 52Chapter 53Chapter 54Chapter 55Chapter 56Chapter 66). After appropriate volume resuscitation, vasopressor therapy may be necessary to alleviate hypotension further. A urinary catheter may aid in diversion of infected urine in the case of a ruptured bladder or proximal urethra and allow time for the necessary correction of any metabolic derangements (typically hyperkalemia and acidosis) before surgery. Analgesia is an important component of preoperative management for peritonitis patients.

Initially, this bandage is replaced twice during the first 24 hours and daily thereafter, although the amount of drainage produced by an individual patient may dictate more frequent changes. A sterile-gloved finger may have to be inserted through the incision to break down adhesions and to allow thorough drainage of the peritoneal cavity. Alternatively, patients with severely contaminated tissues may require daily general anesthesia for repeated abdominal exploration and lavage before reapplying the bandage. The quantity of fluid can be estimated by the difference in weight of the bandage before application and after removal. Abdominal closure typically is performed 3 to 5 days after the initial surgery. The placement of a urinary catheter and collection system helps to limit urine soaking of the bandage and underlying exposed tissues.",

Although the caudal one third to two thirds of the abdominal incision is closed primarily, the remainder of the incision is reapposed loosely (as described earlier in the chapter) and subatmospheric pressure applied to the cranial portion of the incision. This approach has been used successfully in human patients and its success demonstrated by significant reductions in open abdominal drainage duration times, number of dressing changes, re-exploration rate, and successful abdominal closure rates.23, 24 Superiority of this approach has yet to be established in small animal surgical patients. Survival rates for canine and feline septic peritonitis patients treated with VAPD has been reported as 37.5% (3/8)25 and 50% (3/6),26 which is similar to that seen with other abdominal drainage techniques. However, at this time, insufficient case numbers have been examined to draw conclusions as to whether the success of VAPD seen in human patients can be achieved in veterinary medicine. Dressings are available commercially that provide a barrier between the abdominal wall and viscera to protect the abdominal organs.",

Typically, one drain placed between the liver and diaphragm is sufficient for small dogs and cats, whereas two drains are more appropriate for larger dogs (the fenestrated portion of second drain is placed in the caudal abdomen along the ventral body wall). The drain tubes exit the body wall through a paramedian stab incision and are sutured to the abdominal skin with a pursestring and Chinese finger-trap sutures (Figure 122-4\n). After routine closure of the abdomen, the suction reservoir bulb is attached to the tubing with vacuum (negative pressure) applied. A protective abdominal bandage is placed with sterile contact material around the tube-skin interface and is changed daily to allow assessment of this site. Fluid collected within the bulbs is emptied using aseptic technique, and the volume is recorded every 4 to 6 hours, or more frequently if needed. Drains are removed by applying gentle traction when the volume of fluid production has decreased significantly and cytologic analysis suggests resolution of the peritonitis (i.e., decreasing cell numbers and nondegenerative neutrophils, absence of bacteria). A sterile bandage is reapplied to cover the drain exit site for 24 hours.",
